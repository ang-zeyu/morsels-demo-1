[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15460"],[0,"A Course In Wood Turning (#5)"],[1,"rolled on its side so that the grind at the  cutting point, which is on the lip of the gouge well below the center,  is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. Fig. 11.    Slowly raise the handle to force the gouge into the wood. As soon as the  gouge has taken hold, the tool is forced forward and upward by a slight  lowering of the handle, while at the same time it is rolled back toward  its first position. Care should be taken not to roll the chisel too fast  or a perfect arc will not be cut.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    By this triple action the grind, which comes in contact with the surface  of the curve, forces the lip sidewise and cuts one quarter of a circle.  Reverse the position of the gouge and cut from the other side in the  same manner to form the other half of the semi-circle. The cutting  should always stop at the base of the cut as there is danger that the  tool will catch when cutting against the grain of the wood on the other  side. Repeat this operation until within about 1/16\" of the required  size. At the end of each successive cut the tool should have been forced  far enough forward and upward to bring the grind or nose of the chisel  well out on top of the cut. Fig. 12.    The exact depth of the concave is then calipered in the usual manner as  described before. A finishing cut is then taken after the cut has been  tested with a templet.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]      A-I--6-a. Convex Cuts    The convex cut, or Bead as it is usually called, is generally considered  the hardest cut to make.--The cut is made with the heel of a small skew  chisel, usually the 1/4\" or 1/8\".    After the cylinder has been marked off, rough out all stock between the  beads with a parting tool. The base of the cuts is finished the same as  described in Plate A-I--1-a, for shoulder cutting. With a sharp pencil  mark the center of each bead to be made. This line is the starting point  for all cutting.    Place the chisel on the rest, with the cutting edge above the cylinder  and the lower grind tangent to it. Draw the chisel back and raise the  handle to bring the heel of the chisel in contact with the cylinder at  the line indicating the center of the bead. The chisel is then moved to  the right (if cutting the right side of the bead); at the same time the  chisel is continually tipped to keep the lower grind tangent to the  revolving cylinder and also to the bead at the point of contact. Fig.  13. This cut is continued until the bottom of the bead is reached. It is  well in turning a series of beads to work the same side of all before  reversing to the other side.    Note:--The same principles employed in this exercise are also used in  working out long convex curves such as are found in chisel handles,  mallet handles, etc. The only exception is that in most cases the point  of contact need not be the heel of the chisel but higher up as in  ordinary straight work.      A-I--7-a--Combination Cuts    These exercises are so designed as to include one or more of each of the  foregoing cuts. The student here is given an opportunity of combining  these cuts into one finished product.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.]    An analysis of the exercise chosen should be made to determine which of  the various cuts should be made first, second, etc., in order to produce  the exercise in the shortest time and with the least amount of tool  manipulation.    After the student has mastered these cuts with a certain degree of skill  and accuracy, he is ready to apply them in working out various models in  Section II.      A-II--1-a. Chisel Handles    At this point it is well to state that the small end of all work should  be turned at the dead center. In the case of chisel handles the socket  or ferrule end is at the dead center where the stock can safely be cut  away to permit the fitting of the ferrule or the socket.    After the stock is turned to a cylinder of the largest dimension  desired, the taper, for the socket chisel, should be turned first and  fitted to the chisel in which it is to be used. Then the rest of the  handle is worked out. Ferrules should also be fitted in the same manner.  A drive fit should be used for all ferrules.      A-II--2 and 3. Mallets and Gavels    The biggest source of trouble in these models is getting the handles to  fit true. This is caused by not getting the hole in the head straight.    Turn the head to a cylinder 3/16\" larger than the finished dimension.  Then bore the hole perpendicular to the axis as near as possible,  either by leaving it between the lathe centers or by placing it in a  vise. The handle is then fitted into the head. A snug fit is necessary.  If one side \"hangs\" or is lower than the other the centers are moved  sufficiently to correct it. The head is then turned to exact size and  finished.      A-II--7. Vise Handles.    Turn the spindle with the solid head to dimensions. Bore a hole through  a 1-1/4\" square block and fit the block snugly to the end of the  spindle. Turn this block to the same dimensions as the other head. This  method will save chucking the second head and is much quicker.          CHAPTER VI    OVAL TURNING      Oval work as a problem in turning will be found to be a very good one as  well as interesting to the pupil. It brings in the principle of the oval  as used in ordinary shop practice; (arcs from points on the major and  minor axes). For thick heavy ovals the off-centering is very slight,  while for long, thin ones the off-centering is greater. The measurements  given on Plates A-III--1-a, b and A-III--2-a, b will give a good idea of  approximate distances to be used.    While the tool operations are much the same as in other spindle turning  there is one notable difference. The design must be worked out by eye,  because of the nature of the work no caliper measurements can be made  for depth of cuts.    To get the best results the stock of oval turning should be cut square  or slightly rectangular in cross-section and about 3\" longer than the  model to be made. The thickness of the stock should be about 1/8\"  greater than the major axis of the oval wanted.    The centers are located in the usual manner after which perpendicular  lines are drawn from the sides, passing through the points of the  centers. From the ends of one of these, perpendicular lines are extended  lengthwise of the stock (on opposite sides) meeting the corresponding  perpendicular at the other end of the stock. These lines form the ridge  of the oval. On the other perpendiculars, the points for off-centering  are laid off, measuring the required distance on both sides of the  center point.    With a 1/8\" drill bore holes 1/4\" deep at each of the off-centering  points as well as the original center. This will insure the lathe  centers penetrating the stock at the proper point. The stock is then  placed in the lathe, using two corresponding off-center points as  centers.    With the lathe running at third speed turn down the stock to the  horizontal line forming the ridge of the oval, excepting for a distance  of about 1-1/4\" at the ends. The stock at the ends is necessary for the  off-centering and, if cut away, will spoil the centering for the other  side, especially at the live center end. The stock is then changed to  the other off-center points and the second side is cut down to the line.    All measurements are then laid out and the design is cut, changing the  stock in the lathe when necessary. Care should be taken that the sharp  ridge left on the work forms a straight line the full length of the  stock. After the design has been finished, the stock is centered on the  true center and a very thin cut is taken the full length of the object  to remove the sharp corners. The model is then sandpapered while the  lathe is running very slowly.          CHAPTER VII    DUPLICATE TURNING      Under the head of duplicate turning have been classified only such  models as clearly indicate the necessity of making two or more articles  to complete the model or set of articles desired. But it is not intended  to convey the idea that other models may not be made in duplicate as in  many cases it is very desirable and even preferable that they should be  made that way. Whatever the problem may be the suggestions offered at  this point may be applied effectively.    Whenever two or more models are to be made identically alike there are  always two possibilities of inaccuracies that will render the work  dissimilar: First, inaccurate measuring both for length and points of  new diameters and also on the new diameters themselves; second, a  variation in the curved surfaces either on long convex or concave cuts.    The first difficulty can be overcome to a great extent by the use of a  measuring stick. This stick should be made of any soft wood. It should  be straight on one edge and about the thickness of an ordinary rule. On  the straight edge lay off very carefully measurements for length,  shoulders, beads, concaves and all points where calipering for new  diameters will be necessary. Insert at each point measured a small brad  which has been sharpened at both ends, leaving the end protrude about  1/8\". Care should be taken that all brads protrude the same distance.    After the stock has been turned to the largest diameter, the stick is  held in the position of the rule while measuring and the points are  forced against the revolving cylinder, thus scoring it. This stick can  be used as many times as the model is to be made and the measurements  will always be the same.    To avoid dissimilar curves it is well to cut out a full sized templet of  the model to be made. This templet can be made of any thin, stiff  material, preferably light sheet iron. In some cases it will be  necessary to make the templet in several pieces in order to help  facilitate the tool operations.    The use of this templet will not only be a help to getting all curved  surfaces the same, but will also "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15464"],[0,"Foods That Will Win the War and How to Cook Them (1918) (#5)"],[1,"more protein and three and a half times as much  fat; beans (dried) a little more protein and one-fifth as much fat;  eggs (one dozen) about the same in protein and one-half more fat. It  is our manifest duty to learn how to make the best use of these foods  in order to save beef, pork and mutton, to be shipped across the sea.  This means that the housekeeper has before her the task of training  the family palate to accept new food preparations. Training the family  palate is not easy, because bodies that have grown accustomed to  certain food combinations find it difficult to get along without them,  and rebel at a change. If these habits of diet are suddenly disturbed  we may upset digestion, as well as create a feeling of dissatisfaction  which is equally harmful to physical well-being. The wise housekeeper  will therefore make her changes gradually.    In reducing meat in the diet of a family that has been used to having  meat twice a day, it will be well to start out with meat once a day  and keep up this regime for a couple of weeks. Then drop meat for a  whole day, supplying in its stead a meat substitute dish that will  furnish the same nutriment. After a while you can use meat substitutes  at least twice a week without disturbing the family's mental or  physical equilibrium. It would be well also to introduce dishes  that extend the meat flavor, such as stews combined with dumplings,  hominy, or rice; pot pies or short cakes with a dressing of meat and  vegetables; meat loaf, souffle or croquettes in which meat is combined  with bread crumbs, potato or rice.    Meat eating is largely a matter of flavor. If flavor is supplied,  the reduction of meat in the diet can be made with little annoyance.  Nutrition can always be supplied in the other dishes that accompany  the meal, as a certain proportion of protein is found in almost every  food product. The meat that we use to obtain flavor in sauces and  gravies need not be large in quantity, nor expensive in cut. The poor  or cheap cuts have generally more flavor than the expensive ones,  the difference being entirely in texture and tenderness, freedom from  gristle and inedible tissue. There are many cereals, such as rice,  hominy, cornmeal, samp and many vegetable dishes, especially dried  beans of all kinds, that are greatly improved by the addition of meat  sauce and when prepared in this way may be served as the main dish of  a meal.    Dr. Harvey W. Wiley has stated that the meat eating of the future will  not be regarded as a necessity so much as it has been in the past, and  that meat will be used more as a condimental substance. Europe has for  years used meat for flavor rather than for nutriment. It would seem  that the time has come for Americans to learn the use of meat for  flavor and to utilize more skillfully the protein of other foods.    It may be difficult to convince the meat lover that he can radically  reduce the proportion of meat in his diet without detriment to health.  Many persons adhere to the notion that you are not nourished unless  you eat meat; that meat foods are absolutely necessary to maintain the  body strength. This idea is entirely without foundation, for the foods  mentioned as meat substitutes earlier in this chapter can be made to  feed the world, and feed it well--in fact, no nation uses so large a  proportion of meat as America.    The first step, therefore, in preparing ourselves to reduce meat  consumption is to recognize that only a small quantity of meat is  necessary to supply sufficient protein for adult life. The growing  child or the youth springing into manhood needs a larger percentage of  meat than the adult, and in apportioning the family's meat ration this  fact should not be overlooked.    The second step is to reduce the amount purchased, choosing cuts that  contain the least waste, and by utilizing with care that which we do  purchase. Fat, trimmings, and bones all have their uses and should be  saved from the garbage pail.    Careful buying, of course, depends on a knowledge of cuts, a study  of the percentage of waste in each cut, and the food value of the  different kinds of meat. Make a study of the different cuts, as shown  in the charts on pages 36, 37, and armed with this knowledge go forth  to the butcher for practical buying.    Then comes the cooking, which can only be properly done when the  fundamental principles of the cooking processes, such as boiling,  braising, broiling, stewing, roasting and frying are understood.  Each cut requires different handling to secure the maximum amount of  nutriment and flavor. The waste occasioned by improper cooking is a  large factor in both household and national economy.    It has been estimated that a waste of an ounce each day of edible meat  or fat in the twenty million American homes amounts to 456,000,000  pounds of valuable animal food a year. At average dressed weights,  this amounts to 875,000 steers, or over 3,000,000 hogs. Each  housekeeper, therefore, who saves her ounce a day aids in this  enormous saving, which will mean so much in the feeding of our men on  the fighting line.    So the housekeeper who goes to her task of training the family palate  to accept meat substitutes and meat economy dishes, who revolutionizes  her methods of cooking so as to utilize even \"the pig's squeak,\" will  be doing her bit toward making the world safe for democracy.    The following charts, tables of nutritive values and suggested menus  have been arranged to help her do this work. The American woman has  her share in this great world struggle, and that is the intelligent  conservation of food.      SELECTION OF MEAT    BEEF--Dull red as cut, brighter after exposure to air; lean, well  mottled with fat; flesh, firm; fat, yellowish in color. Best beef from  animal 3 to 5 years old, weighing 900 to 1,200 pounds. Do not buy wet,  soft, or pink beef.    VEAL--Flesh pink. (If white, calf was bled before killed or animal too  young.) The fat should be white.    MUTTON--Best from animal 3 years old. Flesh dull red, fat firm and  white.    LAMB--(Spring Lamb 3 months to 6 months old; season, February to  March.) Bones of lamb should be small; end of bone in leg of lamb  should be serrated; flesh pink, and fat white.    PORK--The lean should be fine grained and pale pink. The skin should  be smooth and clear. If flesh is soft, or fat yellowish, pork is not  good.      SELECTION OF TOUGHER CUTS AND THEIR USES    Less expensive cuts of meat have more nourishment than the more  expensive, and if properly cooked and seasoned, have as much  tenderness. Tough cuts, as chuck or top sirloin, may be boned and  rolled and then roasted by the same method as tender cuts, the only  difference will be that the tougher cuts require longer cooking. Have  the bones from rolled meats sent home to use for soups. Corned beef  may be selected from flank, naval, plate or brisket. These cuts are  more juicy than rump or round cuts.    1. _For pot roast_ use chuck, crossrib, round, shoulder, rump or top  sirloin.    2. _For stew_ use shin, shoulder, top sirloin or neck.    3. _For steaks_ use flank, round or chuck. If these cuts are pounded,  or both pounded and rubbed with a mixture of 1 part vinegar and 2  parts oil before cooking, they will be very tender.    4. _Soups_--Buy shin or neck. The meat from these may be utilized  by serving with horseradish or mustard sauce, or combined with equal  amount of fresh meat for meat loaf, scalloped dish, etc.      DRY METHODS    1. _Roasting or Baking_--Oven roasting or baking is applied to roasts.    Place the roast in a hot oven, or if gas is used, put in the broiling  oven to sear the outside quickly, and thus keep in the juices.  Salt, pepper and flour. If an open roasting pan is used place a few  tablespoonfuls of fat and 1 cup of water in the pan, which should be  used to baste the roast frequently. If a covered pan is used basting  is unnecessary.      Beef or mutton   (5 to 8 lbs.)  10 min. to the lb.  10 min. extra    Lamb             (5 to 8 lbs.)  12 min. to the lb.  12 min. extra    Veal             (5 to 8 lbs.)  15 min. to the lb.  15 min. extra    Pork             (5 to 8 lbs.)  25 min. to the lb.  25 min. extra    Turkey                          20 min. to the lb.    Chicken                         30 min. to the lb.    Duck                            30 min. to the lb.    Goose                           30 min. to the lb.    Game                            30 min. to the lb.    2. _Broiling_--Cooking over or under clear fire. This method is used  for chops or steaks.    Sear the meat on both sides. Then reduce the heat and turn the meat  frequently. Use no fat.      _Time Table_--(Count time after meat is seared).                  1/2 inch chops or steaks, 5 minutes                    1 inch chops or steaks, 10 minutes                    2 inch chops or steaks, 15 to 18 minutes    3. _Pan Broiling_--Cooking in pan with no fat. _Time table same as for  broiling_ chops, steaks, etc.    4. _Sauteing_--Cooking in pan in small amount of fat. Commonly  termed \"frying.\" Used for steaks, chops, etc. _Time table same as for  broiling._      MOIST METHODS    1. Boiling--Cooking in boiling water--especially poultry, salt meats,  etc.    2. Steaming--A method of cooking by utilizing steam from boiling  water, which retains more food value than any other. Too seldom  applied to meats.    3. Frying--Cooking by immersion in hot fat at temperature 400 to 450  degrees Fahrenheit. Used for croquettes, etc.    If a fat thermometer is not available, test by using small pieces of  bread. Put into heated fat:    A--For croquettes made from food requiring little cooking, such as  oysters, or from previously cooked mixtures, as rice, fish or meat  croquettes, bread should brown in one-half minute.    B--For mixtures requiring cooking, as doughnuts, fritters, etc., bread  should brown in one minute.      COMBINATION METHODS    1. Pot"]]]
