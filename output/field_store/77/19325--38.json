Meanwhile Ananzi  lighted a fire, and took out some of the fat, and got his frying pan  ready, and as fast as the fish came out of the water he caught them and  put them into the frying pan, and so he did with all of them until he  got to the Head-fish, who was so slippery that he couldn't hold him, and  he got back again into the water.    When Ananzi had fried all the fish, he put them into the sacks, and  took the sacks on his back, and set off to the mountains. He had not  gone very far when he met Lion, and Lion said to him:    \"Well, brother Ananzi, where have you been? I have not seen you a long  time.\"    Ananzi said, \"I have been travelling about.\"    \"Oh! But what have you got there?\" said the Lion.    \"Oh! I have got my mother's bones--she has been dead these forty-eleven  years, and they say I must not keep her here, so I am taking her up into  the middle of the mountains to bury her.\"    Then they parted. After he had gone a little way, the Lion said: \"I know  that Ananzi is a great rogue; I dare say he has got something there that  he doesn't want me to see, and I will just follow him;\" but he took care  not to let Ananzi see him.    Now, when Ananzi got into the wood, he set his sacks down, and took one  fish out and began to eat; then a fly came, and Ananzi said, \"I cannot  eat any more, for there is some one near;\" so he tied the sack up, and  went on farther into the mountains, where he set his sacks down, and  took out two fish which he ate; and no fly came. He said, \"There is no  one near;\" so he took out more fish. But when he had eaten about half a  dozen the Lion came up and said:    \"Well, brother Ananzi, a pretty tale you have told me.\"    \"Oh! brother Lion, I am so glad you have come; never mind what tale I  have told you, but come and sit down--it was only my fun.\"    So Lion sat down and began to eat; but before Ananzi had eaten two fish,  Lion had emptied one of the sacks. Then said Ananzi to himself:    \"Greedy fellow, eating up all my fish.\"    \"What do you say, sir?\"    \"I only said you do not eat half fast enough,\" for he was afraid the  Lion would eat him up.    Then they went on eating, but Ananzi wanted to revenge himself, and he  said to the Lion, \"Which of us do you think is the stronger?\"    The Lion said, \"Why, I am, of course.\"    Then Ananzi said, \"We will tie one another to the tree, and we shall see  which is the stronger.\"    Now they agreed that the Lion should tie Ananzi first, and he tied him  with some very fine string, and did not tie him tight. Ananzi twisted  himself about two or three times, and the string broke.    Then it was Ananzi's turn to tie the Lion, and he took some very strong  cord. The Lion said, \"You must not tie me tight, for I did not tie you  tight.\" And Ananzi said, \"Oh! no, to be sure, I will not.\" But he tied  him as tight as ever he could, and then told him to try and get loose.    The Lion tried and tried in vain--he could not get loose. Then Ananzi  thought, now is my chance; so he got a big stick and beat him, and then  went away and left him, for he was afraid to loose him lest he should  kill him.    Now there was a woman called Miss Nancy, who was going out one morning  to get some \"callalou\" (spinach) in the wood, and as she was going she  heard some one say, \"Good morning, Miss Nancy!\" She could not tell who  spoke to her, but she looked where the voice came from, and saw the Lion  tied to the tree.    \"Good morning, Mr. Lion, what are you doing there?\"    He said, \"It is all that fellow Ananzi who has tied me to the tree, but  will you loose me?\"    But she said, \"No, for I am afraid, if I do, you will kill me.\" But he  gave her his word he would not; still she could not trust him; but he  begged her again and again, and said:    \"Well, if I do try to eat you, I hope all the trees will cry out shame  upon me.\"    So at last she consented; but she had no sooner loosed him, than he came  up to her to eat her, for he had been so many days without food that he  was quite ravenous, but the trees immediately cried out, \"Shame,\" and so  he could not eat her. Then she went away as fast as she could, and the  Lion found his way home.    When Lion got home he told his wife and children all that happened to  him, and how Miss Nancy had saved his life, so they said they would have  a great dinner, and ask Miss Nancy. Now when Ananzi heard of it, he  wanted to go to the dinner, so he went to Miss Nancy, and said she must  take him with her as her child, but she said, \"No.\" Then he said, \"I can  turn myself into quite a little child and then you can take me,\" and at  last she said, \"Yes;\" and he told her, when she was asked what pap her  baby ate, she must be sure to tell them it did not eat pap, but the same  food as every one else; and so they went, and had a very good dinner,  and set off home again--but somehow one of the Lion's sons fancied that  all was not right, and he told his father he was sure it was Ananzi, and  the Lion set out after him.    Now as they were going along, before the Lion got up to them, Ananzi  begged Miss Nancy to put him down, that he might run, which he did, and  he got away and ran along the wood, and the Lion ran after him. When he  found the Lion was overtaking him, he turned himself into an old man  with a bundle of wood on his head--and when the Lion got up to him, he  said, \"Good morning, Mr. Lion,\" and the Lion said, \"Good morning, old  gentleman.\"    Then the old man said, \"What are you after now?\" and the Lion asked if  he had seen Ananzi pass that way, but the old man said, \"No, that fellow  Ananzi is always meddling with some one; what mischief has he been up to  now?\"    Then the Lion told him, but the old man said it was no use to follow him  any more, for he would never catch him, and so the Lion wished him  good-day, and turned and went home again.          VI    THE GRATEFUL FOXES      One fine spring day two friends went out to a moor to gather fern,  attended by a boy with a bottle of wine and a box of provisions. As they  were straying about, they saw at the foot of a hill two foxes that had  brought out their cub to play; and whilst they looked on, struck by the  strangeness of the sight, three children came up from a neighbouring  village with baskets in their hands, on the same errand as themselves.  As soon as the children saw the foxes, they picked up a bamboo stick and  took the creatures stealthily in the rear; and when the old foxes took  to flight, they surrounded them and beat them with the stick, so that  they ran away as fast as their legs could carry them; but two of the  boys held down the cub, and, seizing it by the scruff of the neck, went  off in high glee.    The two friends were looking on all the while, and one of them, raising  his voice, shouted out, \"Hallo! you boys! what are you doing with that  fox?\"    The eldest of the boys replied, \"We're going to take him home and sell  him to a young man in our village. He'll buy him, and then he'll boil  him in a pot and eat him.\"    \"Well,\" replied the other, after considering the matter attentively, \"I  suppose it's all the same to you whom you sell him to. You'd better let  me have him.\"    \"Oh, but the young man from our village promised us a good sum if we  could find a fox, and got us to come out to the hills and catch one; and  so we can't sell him to you at any price.\"    \"Well, I suppose it cannot be helped, then; but how much would the young  man give you for the cub?\"    \"Oh, he'll give us three hundred cash at least.\"    \"Then I'll give you half a bu;[1] and so you'll gain five hundred cash  by the transaction.\"    \"Oh, we'll sell him for that, sir. How shall we hand him over to you?\"    \"Just tie him up here,\" said the other; and so he made fast the cub  round the neck with the string of the napkin in which the luncheon-box  was wrapped, and gave half a bu to the three boys, who ran away  delighted.    The man's friend, upon this, said to him: \"Well, certainly you have got  queer tastes. What on earth are you going to keep the fox for?\"    \"How very unkind of you to speak of my tastes like that. If we had not  interfered just now, the fox's cub would have lost its life. If we had  not seen the affair, there would have been no help for it. How could I  stand by and see life taken? It was but a little I spent--only half a  bu--to save the cub, but had it cost a fortune I should not have grudged  it. I thought you were intimate enough with me to know my heart; but  to-day you have accused me of being eccentric, and I see how mistaken I  have been in you. However, our friendship shall cease from this day  forth.\"    And when he had said this with a great deal of firmness, the other,  retiring backward and bowing with his hands on his knees, replied:    \"Indeed, indeed, I am filled with admiration at the goodness of your  heart. When I hear you speak thus, I feel more than ever how great is  the love I bear you. I thought that you might wish to use the cub as a  sort of decoy to lead the old ones to you, that you might pray them to  bring prosperity and virtue to your house. When I called you eccentric  just now, I was but trying your heart, because I had some suspicions of  you; and now I am truly ashamed of myself.\"    And as he spoke, still bowing, the other replied: \"Really! was that  indeed your thought? Then I pray you to forgive me for my violent  language.\"    When the two friends had thus become reconciled, they examined the cub,  and saw that it had a slight wound in its foot, and could not walk; and  while they were thinking what they should do, they spied out the herb  called \"Doctor's Nakase,\" which was just sprouting; so they rolled up a  little of it in their fingers and applied it to the part.

(The hedgehog is standing by his door looking at the cabbage field which  he thinks is his own.)    HEDGEHOG: Wife, have you dressed the children yet?    WIFE: Just through, my dear.    HEDGEHOG: Well, come out here and let us look at our cabbage patch.    (Wife comes out.)    HEDGEHOG: Fine crop, isn't it? We should be happy.    WIFE: The cabbage is fine enough, but I can't see why we should be so  happy.    [Illustration: The hare and the hedgehog with a cabbage]    HEDGEHOG: Why, my dear, there are tears in your voice. What is the  matter?    WIFE: I suppose I ought not to mind it, but those dreadful hares nearly  worry the life out of me.    HEDGEHOG: What are they doing now?    WIFE: Doing? What are they not doing? Why, yesterday I brought my pretty  babies out here to get some cabbage leaves. We were eating as  well-behaved hedgehogs always eat, and those horrid hares almost made us  cry.    HEDGEHOG: What did they do?    WIFE: They came to our cabbage patch and they giggled and said, \"Oh, see  the little duck-legged things! Aren't they funny?\" Then one jumped over  a cabbage just to hurt our feelings.    HEDGEHOG: Well, they are mean, I know, but we won't notice them. I'll  get even with them one of these days. Ah, there comes one of them now.    WIFE: Yes, and he laughed at me yesterday. He said, \"Good-morning, Madam  Shortlegs.\" I won't speak to him. I'll hide till he goes by.    (Wife hides behind a cabbage.)    HEDGEHOG: Good-morning, sir.    HARE: Are you speaking to me?    HEDGEHOG: Certainly; do you see any one else around?    HARE: How dare you speak to me?    HEDGEHOG: Oh, just to be neighborly.    HARE: I shall ask you not to speak to me hereafter. I think myself too  good to notice hedgehogs.    HEDGEHOG: Now, that is strange.    HARE: What is strange?    HEDGEHOG: Why, I have just said to my wife that we wouldn't notice you.    HARE: Wouldn't notice me, indeed, you silly, short-legged, duck-legged  thing!    HEDGEHOG: Well, my legs are quite as good as yours, sir.    HARE: As good as mine! Who ever heard of such a thing? Why, you can do  little more than crawl.    HEDGEHOG: That may be as you say, but I'll run a race with you any day.    HARE: Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! A race with a hedgehog! Well, well, well!    HEDGEHOG: Are you afraid to run with me?    HARE: Of course not. It will be no race at all, but I'll run just to  show you how silly you are.    HEDGEHOG: Good! You run in that furrow; I will run in this. We shall see  who gets to the fence first. Let's start from the far end of the furrow.    HARE: I will run to the brook and back while you are getting there. Go  ahead.    HEDGEHOG: I wouldn't stay too long if I were you.    HARE: Oh, I'll be back before you reach the end of the furrow.    (The hare runs off to the brook.)      II      HEDGEHOG: Wife, wife, did you hear what I said to the hare?    WIFE: Did I hear? I should say I did. What are you thinking of? Have you  lost your senses?    HEDGEHOG: You shouldn't speak that way to me. What do you know about a  man's business? Come here and let me whisper something to you.    (He whispers and then walks to far end of the furrow. His wife laughs.)    WIFE: Ha, ha! I see. I see. Nothing wrong with your brains.      \"Short legs, long wit,    Long legs, not a bit,\"    as my grandmother used to say. The hare will find that out today.    (She stoops down in the near end of the furrow. The hare returns and  takes his place.)    HARE: Well, are you ready?    HEDGEHOG: Of course I am,--ready and waiting.      HARE: One for the money,    Two for the show,    Three to make ready,    And here we go!    (The hare runs as swiftly as the wind. The hedgehog starts with him, but  stops and stoops low in the furrow. When the hare reaches the other end,  the hedgehog's wife puts up her head.)    WIFE: Well, here I am.    HARE: What does this mean?    WIFE: It means what it means.    HARE: We'll try again. Are you ready?    WIFE: Of course I am.      HARE: One for the money,    Two for the show,    Three to make ready,    And here we go!    (The hare runs swiftly back again. Wife starts, but stops and stoops  low. The hare reaches the other end. The hedgehog puts up his head.)    HEDGEHOG: Here I am.    HARE: I can't understand this.    HEDGEHOG: It is very clear to me.    HARE: Well, we'll try again. Are you ready?    HEDGEHOG: I'm always ready.      HARE: One for the money,    Two for the show,    Three to make ready,    And here we go!    (Again the wife puts up her head and the hare is bewildered.)    [Illustration: The hare racing as the hedhog looks on]    WIFE: You see I am here.    HARE: I just can't believe it.    WIFE: A perfectly simple thing.    HARE: We'll try once more. You can't beat me another time.    WIFE: Don't boast. You had better save your breath for the race; you  will need it.      HARE: One for the money,    Two for the show,    Three to make ready,    And here we go!    (When the hare reaches the other end of the field, the hedgehog puts up  his head.)    HARE: This is very strange.    HEDGEHOG: Shall we run again? You seem a little tired, but I am  perfectly fresh.    HARE (_panting_): No, no! The race is yours.    HEDGEHOG: Will you call my wife and children names any more?    HARE: No, no! I'll never do that again.    HEDGEHOG: Very well. And if you wish a race at any time, friend hare,  just call by for me.    HARE (_walking off shaking his head_): It's very strange. I hope none of  the other hares will hear of this race.    WIFE (_as she meets the hedgehog_): I thought I should hurt myself  laughing. As my grandmother used to say,      \"Short legs, long wit,    Long legs, not a bit.\"    --GRIMM.          EPAMINONDAS      Epaminondas had a good kind granny, who cooked at \"the big house.\"  Epaminondas liked to go to see her, for she always gave him something to  take home with him.    One day when Epaminondas went to see granny, she was baking a cake, and  she gave Epaminondas a piece to eat. As he was leaving, granny said,  \"Epaminondas, you may take a slice home to your mammy.\"    Epaminondas took it in his little hands and squeezing it just as tight  as he could, ran all the way home. When his mammy saw him, she said,  \"What's that, Epaminondas?\"    \"Cake, mammy. Granny sent it to you.\"    \"Cake!\" cried his mammy. \"Epaminondas, don't you know that's no way to  carry cake? When your granny gives you cake, put it in your hat; then  put your hat on your head and come home. You hear me, Epaminondas?\"    \"Yes, mammy.\"    The next time Epaminondas went to see his granny, she was churning, and  she gave him a pat of fresh butter to carry to his mammy.    Epaminondas said to himself, \"What was it mammy said? Oh, yes! I know.  She said, 'Put it in your hat and put the hat on your head and come  home.' I'll do just what she told me.\"    Epaminondas put the pat of butter in his hat, put his hat on his head,  and went home.    It was a hot day, and soon the butter began to melt. Drip, drip, drip,  it went into his ears. Drip, drip, drip, it went into his eyes. Drip,  drip, drip, it went down his back. When Epaminondas reached home, he had  no butter in his hat. It was all on him.    Looking at him hard, his mammy said, \"Epaminondas, what in the world is  that dripping from your hat?\"    \"Butter, mammy. Granny sent it to you.\"    \"Butter!\" cried his mammy. \"Oh, Epaminondas! Don't you know how to carry  butter? You must wrap it in a cabbage leaf, and take it to the spring.  Then you must cool it in the water, and cool it in the water, and cool  it in the water. When you have done this, take the butter in your hands  and come home. You hear me, Epaminondas?\"    \"Yes, mammy.\"    The next time Epaminondas went to see his granny, she wasn't baking cake  and she wasn't churning. She was sitting in a chair knitting.    She said, \"Epaminondas, look in the woodshed, and you'll see something  you like.\"    Epaminondas looked in the woodshed, and there he found four little  puppies. He played with them all the afternoon, and when he started  home, his granny gave him one.    Epaminondas remembered what his mammy had told him. He wrapped the puppy  in a big cabbage leaf, and took it to the spring. He cooled it in the  water, and cooled it in the water, and cooled it in the water. Then he  took it in his hands, and went home.    When his mammy saw him, she said, \"Epaminondas, what is that in your  hands?\"    \"A puppy dog, mammy.\"    \"A puppy dog!\" cried his mammy. \"Oh, Epaminondas! What makes you act so  foolish? That's no way to carry a puppy. The way to carry a puppy is to  tie a string around his neck and put him on the ground. Then you take  the other end of the string in your hand and come along home. You hear  me, Epaminondas?\"    \"Yes, mammy.\"    Epaminondas was going to be right the next time; he got a piece of  string and put it in his pocket to have it ready.    The next day company came to see Epaminondas's mammy, and she had no  bread for dinner. She called"]]]
