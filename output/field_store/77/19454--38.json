This,  possibly, may be explained by the fact that her ancestors for many  generations had used these gestures. A similar curious instance is  mentioned by Cardinal Wiseman (_Essays_, III, 547, _London_, 1853) of  an Italian blind man, the appearance of whose eyes indicated that he  had never enjoyed sight, and who yet made the same elaborate gestures  made by the people with whom he lived, but which had been used by them  immemorially, as correctly as if he had learned them by observation.        _LOSS OF SPEECH BY ISOLATION._    When human beings have been long in solitary confinement, been  abandoned, or otherwise have become isolated from their fellows, they  have lost speech either partially or entirely, and required to have  it renewed through gestures. There are also several recorded cases of  children, born with all their faculties, who, after having been lost  or abandoned, have been afterwards found to have grown up possessed  of acute hearing, but without anything like human speech. One of these  was Peter, \"the Wild Boy,\" who was found in the woods of Hanover in  1726, and taken to England, where vain attempts were made to teach him  language, though he lived to the age of seventy. Another was a boy of  twelve, found in the forest of Aveyron, in France, about the beginning  of this century, who was destitute of speech, and all efforts to teach  him failed. Some of these cases are to be considered in connection  with the general law of evolution, that in degeneration the last  and highest acquirements are lost first. When in these the effort  at acquiring or re-acquiring speech has been successful, it has been  through gestures, in the same manner as missionaries, explorers,  and shipwrecked mariners have become acquainted with tongues before  unknown to themselves and sometimes to civilization. All persons in  such circumstances are obliged to proceed by pointing to objects and  making gesticulations, at the same time observing what articulate  sounds were associated with those motions by the persons addressed,  and thus vocabularies and lists of phrases were formed.        _LOW TRIBES OF MAN._    Apart from the establishment of a systematic language of signs under  special circumstances which have occasioned its development, the  gestures of the lower tribes of men may be generally classed under the  emotional or instinctive division, which can be correlated with those  of the lower animals. This may be illustrated by the modes adopted to  show friendship in salutation, taking the place of our shaking hands.  Some Pacific Islanders used to show their joy at meeting friends by  sniffing at them, after the style of well-disposed dogs. The Fuegians  pat and slap each other, and some Polynesians stroke their own faces  with the hand or foot of the friend. The practice of rubbing or  pressing noses is very common. It has been noticed in the Lapland  Alps, often in Africa, and in Australia the tips of the noses are  pressed a long time, accompanied with grunts of satisfaction. Patting  and stroking different parts of the body are still more frequent, and  prevailed among the North American Indians, though with the latter  the most common expression was hugging. In general, the civilities  exchanged are similar to those of many animals.        _GESTURES AS AN OCCASIONAL RESOURCE._    Persons of limited vocabulary, whether foreigners to the tongue  employed or native, but not accomplished in its use, even in the midst  of a civilization where gestures are deprecated, when at fault for  words resort instinctively to physical motions that are not wild nor  meaningless, but picturesque and significant, though perhaps made  by the gesturer for the first time. An uneducated laborer, if  good-natured enough to be really desirous of responding to a request  for information, when he has exhausted his scanty stock of words will  eke them out by original gestures. While fully admitting the advice to  Coriolanus--      Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant    More learned than the ears--    it may be paraphrased to read that the hands of the ignorant are  more learned than their tongues. A stammerer, too, works his arms and  features as if determined to get his thoughts out, in a manner not  only suggestive of the physical struggle, but of the use of gestures  as a hereditary expedient.        _GESTURES OF FLUENT TALKERS._    The same is true of the most fluent talkers on occasions when the  exact vocal formula desired does not at once suggest itself, or is  unsatisfactory without assistance from the physical machinery not  embraced in the oral apparatus. The command of a copious vocabulary  common to both speaker and hearer undoubtedly tends to a phlegmatic  delivery and disdain of subsidiary aid. An excited speaker will,  however, generally make a free use of his hands without regard to  any effect of that use upon auditors. Even among the gesture-hating  English, when they are aroused from torpidity of manner, the hands are  involuntarily clapped in approbation, rubbed with delight, wrung in  distress, raised in astonishment, and waved in triumph. The fingers  are snapped for contempt, the forefinger is vibrated to reprove or  threaten, and the fist shaken in defiance. The brow is contracted with  displeasure, and the eyes winked to show connivance. The shoulders  are shrugged to express disbelief or repugnance, the eyebrows  elevated with surprise, the lips bitten in vexation and thrust out in  sullenness or displeasure, while a higher degree of anger is shown  by a stamp of the foot. Quintilian, regarding the subject, however,  not as involuntary exhibition of feeling and intellect, but for  illustration and enforcement, becomes eloquent on the variety of  motions of which the hands alone are capable, as follows:    \"The action of the other parts of the body assists the speaker, but  the hands (I could almost say) speak themselves. By them do we  not demand, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, supplicate, express  abhorrence and terror, question and deny? Do we not by them express  joy and sorrow, doubt, confession, repentance, measure, quantity,  number, and time? Do they not also encourage, supplicate, restrain,  convict, admire, respect? and in pointing out places and persons do  they not discharge the office of adverbs and of pronouns?\"    Voss adopts almost the words of Quintilian, \"_Manus non modo loquentem  adjuvant, sed ipsae pene loqui videntur_,\" while Cresollius calls the  hand \"the minister of reason and wisdom ... without it there is no  eloquence.\"        _INVOLUNTARY RESPONSE TO GESTURES._    Further evidence of the unconscious survival of gesture language is  afforded by the ready and involuntary response made in signs to signs  when a man with the speech and habits of civilization is brought into  close contact with Indians or deaf-mutes. Without having ever before  seen or made one of their signs, he will soon not only catch the  meaning of theirs, but produce his own, which they will likewise  comprehend, the power seemingly remaining latent in him until called  forth by necessity.        _NATURAL PANTOMIME._    In the earliest part of man's history the subjects of his discourse  must have been almost wholly sensuous, and therefore readily expressed  in pantomime. Not only was pantomime sufficient for all the actual  needs of his existence, but it is not easy to imagine how he could  have used language such as is now known to us. If the best English  dictionary and grammar had been miraculously furnished to him,  together with the art of reading with proper pronunciation, the gift  would have been valueless, because the ideas expressed by the words  had not yet been formed.    That the early concepts were of a direct and material character is  shown by what has been ascertained of the roots of language, and there  does not appear to be much difficulty in expressing by other than  vocal instrumentality all that could have been expressed by those  roots. Even now, with our vastly increased belongings of external  life, avocations, and habits, nearly all that is absolutely necessary  for our physical needs can be expressed in pantomime. Far beyond the  mere signs for eating, drinking, sleeping, and the like, any one will  understand a skillful representation in signs of a tailor, shoemaker,  blacksmith, weaver, sailor, farmer, or doctor. So of washing,  dressing, shaving, walking, driving, writing, reading, churning,  milking, boiling, roasting or frying, making bread or preparing  coffee, shooting, fishing, rowing, sailing, sawing, planing, boring,  and, in short, an endless list.    Max Mueller properly calls touch, scent, and taste the palaioteric,  and sight and hearing the neoteric senses, the latter of which  often require to be verified by the former. Touch is the lowest in  specialization and development, and is considered to be the oldest of  the senses, the others indeed being held by some writers to be only  its modifications. Scent, of essential importance to many animals, has  with man almost ceased to be of any, except in connection with taste,  which he has developed to a high degree. Whether or not sight preceded  hearing in order of development, it is difficult, in conjecturing the  first attempts of man or his hypothetical ancestor at the expression  either of percepts or concepts, to connect vocal sounds with any  large number of objects, but it is readily conceivable that the  characteristics of their forms and movements should have been  suggested to the eye--fully exercised before the tongue--so soon  as the arms and fingers became free for the requisite simulation  or portrayal. There is little distinction between pantomime and a  developed sign language, in which thought is transmitted rapidly and  certainly from hand to eye "]]]
