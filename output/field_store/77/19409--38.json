Dane was reaching for the pay to give the  captors when, to his real astonishment, one of them advanced and pointed  with an extended forefinger claw to the open port.    \"Go in,\" he formed the Trade Lingo words with care. And Dane's surprise  must have been plain to read for the cub followed his speech with a  vigorous nod and set one foot on the ramp to underline his desire.    For one of the Salariki, who had continually manifested their belief that  Terrans and their ship were an offence to the nostrils of all right  living \"men,\" to wish to enter the spacer was an astonishing about-face.  But any advantage no matter how small, which might bring about a closer  understanding, must be seized at once.    Dane accepted the growling Sinbad and beckoned, knowing better than to  touch the boy. \"Come--\"    Only one of the junior clansmen obeyed that invitation. The other  watched, big-eyed, and then scuttled back to the forest when his fellow  called out some suggestion. _He_ was not going to be trapped.    Dane led the way up the ramp, paying no visible attention to the young  Salarik, nor did he urge the other on when he lingered for a long moment  or two at the port. In his mind the Cargo-master apprentice was  feverishly running over the list of general trade goods. What _did_ they  carry which would make a suitable and intriguing gift for a small alien  with such a promising bump of curiosity? If he had only time to get Van  Rycke!    The Salarik was inside the corridor now, his nostrils spread, assaying  each and every odor in this strange place. Suddenly his head jerked as if  tugged by one of his own net ropes. His interest had been riveted by some  scent his sensitive senses had detected. His eyes met Dane's in appeal.  Swiftly the Terran nodded and then followed with a lengthened stride as  the Salarik sped down into the lower reaches of the Queen, obviously in  quest of something of great importance.          Chapter III    CONTACT AT LAST      \"What in\"--Frank Mura, steward, storekeeper, and cook of the Queen,  retreated into the nearest cabin doorway as the young Salarik flashed  down the ladder into his section.    Dane, with the now resigned Sinbad in the crook of his arm, had tailed  his guest and arrived just in time to see the native come to an abrupt  halt before one of the most important doors in the spacer--the portal of  the hydro garden which renewed the ship's oxygen and supplied them with  fresh fruit and vegetables to vary their diet of concentrates.    The Salarik laid one hand on the smooth surface of the sealed compartment  and looked back over his shoulder at Dane with an inquiry to which was  added something of a plea. Guided by his instinct--that this was  important to them all--Dane spoke to Mura:    \"Can you let him in there, Frank?\"    It was not sensible, it might even be dangerous. But every member of the  crew knew the necessity for making some sort of contact with the natives.  Mura did not even nod, but squeezed by the Salarik and pressed the lock.  There was a sign of air, and the crisp smell of growing things, lacking  the languorous perfumes of the world outside, puffed into the faces.    The cub remained where he was, his head up, his wide nostrils visibly  drinking in that smell. Then he moved with the silent, uncanny speed  which was the heritage of his race, darting down the narrow aisle toward  a mass of greenery at the far end.    Sinbad kicked and growled. This was his private hunting ground--the  preserve he kept free of invaders. Dane put the cat down. The Salarik had  found what he was seeking. He stood on tiptoe to sniff at a plant, his  yellow eyes half closed, his whole stance spelling ecstasy. Dane looked  to the steward for enlightenment.    \"What's he so interested in, Frank?\"    \"Catnip.\"    \"Catnip?\" Dane repeated. The word meant nothing to him, but Mura had a  habit of picking up strange plants and cultivating them for study. \"What  is it?\"    \"One of the Terran mints--an herb,\" Mura gave a short explanation as he  moved down the aisle toward the alien. He broke off a leaf and crushed it  between his fingers.    Dane, his sense of smell largely deadened by the pungency with which he  had been surrounded by most of that day, could distinguish no new odor.  But the young Salarik swung around to face the steward his eyes wide, his  nose questing. And Sinbad gave a whining yowl and made a spring to push  his head against the steward's now aromatic hand.    So--now they had it--an opening wedge. Dane came up to the three.    \"All right to take a leaf or two?\" he asked Mura.    \"Why not? I grow it for Sinbad. To a cat it is like heemel smoke or a  tankard of lackibod.\"    And by Sinbad's actions Dane guessed that the plant did hold for the cat  the same attraction those stimulants produced in human beings. He  carefully broke off a small stem supporting three leaves and presented it  to the Salarik, who stared at him and then, snatching the twig, raced  from the hydro garden as if pursued by feuding clansmen.    Dane heard the pad of his feet on the ladder--apparently the cub was  making sure of escape with his precious find. But the Cargo-master  apprentice was frowning. As far as he could see there were only five of  the plants.    \"That's all the catnip you have?\"    Mura tucked Sinbad under his arm and shooed Dane before him out of the  hydro. \"There was no need to grow more. A small portion of the herb goes  a long way with this one,\" he put the cat down in the corridor. \"The  leaves may be preserved by drying. I believe that there is a small box of  them in the galley.\"    A strictly limited supply. Suppose this was the key which would unlock  the Koros trade? And yet it was to be summed up in five plants and a few  dried leaves! However, Van Rycke must know of this as soon as possible.    But to Dane's growing discomfiture the Cargo-master showed no elation as  his junior poured out the particulars of his discovery. Instead there  were definite signs of displeasure to be read by those who knew Van Rycke  well. He heard Dane out and then got to his feet. Tolling the younger man  with him by a crooked finger, he went out of his combined office-living  quarters to the domain of Medic Craig Tau.    \"Problem for you, Craig.\" Van Rycke seated his bulk on the wall jump seat  Tau pulled down for him. Dane was left standing just within the door,  very sure now that instead of being commended for his discovery of a few  minutes before, he was about to suffer some reprimand. And the reason for  it still eluded him.    \"What do you know about that plant Mura grows in the hydro--the one  called 'catnip'?\"    Tau did not appear surprised at that demand--the Medic of a Free Trading  spacer was never surprised at anything. He had his surfeit of shocks  during his first years of service and after that accepted any occurrence,  no matter how weird, as matter-of-fact. In addition Tau's hobby was  \"magic,\" the hidden knowledge possessed and used by witch doctors and  medicine men on alien worlds. He had a library of recordings, odd scraps  of information, of certified results of certain very peculiar  experiments. Now and then he wrote a report which was sent into Central  Service, read with raised eyebrows by perhaps half a dozen incredulous  desk warmers, and filed away to be safely forgotten. But even that had  ceased to frustrate him.    \"It's an herb of the mint family from Terra,\" he replied. \"Mura grows it  for Sinbad--has quite a marked influence on cats. Frank's been trying to  keep him anchored to the ship by allowing him to roll in fresh leaves. He  does it--then continues to sneak out whenever he can--\"    That explained something for Dane--why the Salariki cub wished to enter  the Queen tonight. Some of the scent of the plant had clung to Sinbad's  fur, had been detected, and the Salarik had wanted to trace it to its  source.    \"Is it a drug?\" Van Rycke prodded.    \"In the way that all herbs are drugs. Human beings have dosed themselves  in the past with a tea made of the dried leaves. It has no great  medicinal properties. To felines it is a stimulation--and they get the  same satisfaction from rolling in and eating the leaves as we do from  drinking--\"    \"The Salariki are, in a manner of speaking, felines--\" Van Rycke mused.    Tau straightened. \"The Salariki have discovered catnip, I take it?\"    Van Rycke nodded at Dane and for the second time the Cargo-master  apprentice made his report. When he was done Van Rycke asked a direct  question of the medical officer:    \"What effect would catnip have on a Salarik?\"    It was only then that Dane grasped the enormity of what he had done. They  had no way of gauging the influence of an off-world plant on alien  metabolism. What if he had introduced to the natives of Sargol a  dangerous drug--started that cub on some path of addiction. He was cold  inside. Why, he might even have poisoned the child!    Tau picked up his cap, and after a second's hesitation, his emergency  medical kit. He had only one question for Dane.    \"Any idea of who the cub is--what clan he belongs to?\"    And Dane, chill with real fear, was forced to answer in the negative.  What _had_ he done!    \"Can you find him?\" Van Rycke, ignoring Dane, spoke to Tau.    The Medic shrugged. \"I can try. I was out scouting this morning--met one  of the storm priests who handles their medical work. But I wasn't  welcomed. However, under the circumstances, we have to try something--\"    In the corridor Van Rycke had an order for Dane. \"I suggest that you keep  to quarters, Thorson, until we know how matters stand.\"    Dane saluted. That note in his superior's voice was like a whip  lash--much worse to take than the abuse of a lesser man. He swallowed as  he shut himself into his own cramped cubby. This might be the end of  their venture. And they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#5)"],[1,"as Nero's double.    After receiving the news of the German revolt, although Galba knew      14  nothing for certain of Vitellius' plans, he was fearful to what  lengths the outbreak of the troops might go; so, being unable to trust  the troops in the city,[36] he had recourse to what seemed his sole  remedy and held an Imperial Election. Besides Vinius and Laco he  summoned Marius Celsus, consul-elect and the City-Prefect Ducenius  Geminus.[37] After prefacing a few words about his own advanced age he  ordered Piso Licinianus[38] to be sent for, either on his own  initiative, or, as some believed, at the instance of Laco. Laco had  met Piso at Rubellius Plautus' house and they had formed a friendship,  but he cunningly pretended that he was supporting a stranger, and  Piso's good repute gave colour to this policy. Piso was a noble on  both sides, being the son of Marcus Crassus and Scribonia. There was  an old-world austerity in his face and bearing, and just critics spoke  of his strict morality: people who took a less favourable view thought  him soured. But while those who disliked this side of his character  carped at it, it was a recommendation in the eyes of the emperor who  intended to adopt him.    Galba is said to have taken Piso's hand and addressed him as            15  follows: 'Were I a private citizen, and were I to adopt you in the  presence of the Priests by the usual formality of a curial  statute,[39] it would be an honour for me to introduce into my family  a descendant of Cnaeus Pompeius and of Marcus Crassus, and for you it  would be a distinction to add to your noble ancestry the glories of  the Sulpician and Lutatian houses.[40] As it is, I have been called by  the consent of gods and men to be an emperor. Your distinguished  qualities and your patriotism have persuaded me to offer to you  peacefully and quietly the throne for which our ancestors fought on  the field of battle,[41] and which I too won by war. In so doing I am  following the precedent set by the sainted Augustus, who raised to the  rank next himself first his nephew Marcellus, then his son-in-law  Agrippa, then his daughter's sons,[42] and finally his stepson  Tiberius Nero. However, while Augustus looked for a successor in his  own family, I have searched throughout the country. Not that I lack  either kinsmen or supporters, but it was by no favour of birth that I  myself came to the throne, and, to prove my policy in this matter,  consider how I have passed over not only my own relatives but yours.  You have an elder brother,[43] as noble as yourself. He would have  been worthy of this position, but you are worthier. You are old enough  to have outlived youthful passions. Your life has been such that you  have nothing in your past to excuse. So far you have only experienced  misfortune. Prosperity probes the heart with a keener touch; misery  only calls for patience, but there is corruption in success. Honesty,  candour, and affection are the best of human qualities, and doubtless  you yourself have enough character to retain them. But the  complaisance of others will weaken your character. Flattery and  servile compliments will break down its defences and self-interest  too, the bane of all sincerity. What though you and I can talk plainly  with each other to-day? Others will address themselves not to us but  to our fortunes. To persuade an emperor what he ought to do is a  laborious task: any one can flatter him without a spark of sincerity.    'If the vast bulk of this empire could stand and keep its balance       16  without a guiding hand, the Republic might well have dated its birth  from me. As it is, things have long ago come to such a pass that  neither I in my old age can give the Roman people any better gift than  a good successor, nor you in your prime anything better than a good  emperor. Under Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, Rome was the heirloom  of a single family. There is a kind of liberty in the free choice we  have begun to exercise. Now that the Julian and Claudian houses are  extinct, by the plan of adoption the best man will always be  discovered. Royal birth is the gift of fortune, and is but valued as  such. In adoption we can use a free judgement, and if we wish to  choose well, the voice of the country points the way. Think of Nero,  swollen with the pride of his long line of royal ancestry. It was not  Vindex with a powerless province at his back, nor I with a single  legion that freed Rome's shoulders of that burden: it was his own  cruelty and profligacy. And that was before there was any precedent  for the conviction of an emperor.    'We have been called to the throne by the swords of those who thought  us worthy. Our high state will not escape the eye of envy. You may be  sure of that. But there is no reason for you to feel alarm because in  this world-wide upheaval a couple of legions have not yet settled  down. I myself did not succeed to a safe and peaceful throne, and,  when once the news of your adoption is spread, I shall cease to be  charged with my advanced age, which is now the only fault they find in  me. The rascals will always miss Nero: you and I have got to see that  good citizens do not miss him too.    'A longer sermon would ill befit the time and I have fulfilled my  purpose, if I have done right in choosing you. The soundest and  easiest criterion of right and wrong policy is to consider what you  would have approved or condemned in another emperor. For Rome is not  like the nations which are ruled by kings, where one house is supreme  and the rest are slaves. Your future subjects are men who cannot  endure the extremes either of bondage or of freedom.'    Galba spoke these words and more to the same effect in the tone of one  creating an emperor: the rest addressed Piso as though he were emperor  already. He is said to have betrayed no sign of amazement or            17  elation either before those who were then present, or later when  everybody's eyes centred upon him. His language to his emperor and  adoptive father was deeply respectful and he spoke modestly of  himself. He made no change in his expression or bearing, showing  himself more able than anxious to rule. A discussion then took place  whether the adoption should be announced before the people or in the  senate, or in the guards' camp. They decided in favour of the camp, on  the ground that it would be a compliment to the troops, whose goodwill  was hard to win by flattery or bribes, but was by no means to be  despised, if it could be won by good means. Meanwhile the curiosity of  the populace, impatient of any important secret, had brought together  crowds all round the Palace, and when once the rumour began to leak  out an attempt at suppression only resulted in spreading it.    The tenth of January was a dreary wet day, and an extraordinary         18  storm of thunder and lightning showed the displeasure of Providence.  Such phenomena were regarded in old days as a sign for the suspension  of public business, but they did not deter Galba from proceeding to  the camp. Either he disregarded such things as the result of pure  chance or else he felt that the blows of fate may be foretold but not  forestalled. He addressed a crowded assembly of the soldiers with true  imperial brevity, stating simply that in adopting Piso he was  following the example of the sainted Augustus, and the old military  custom whereby each man chose another.[44] He was afraid that by  suppressing the news of the German rebellion he might only seem to  exaggerate the danger, so he voluntarily declared that the Fourth and  Twenty-second legions had been led by a few traitors into seditious  murmurings but no further, and would soon return to their allegiance.  He made no attempt to enhance his words either by eloquence or  largess. However, the tribunes and centurions and those of the  soldiers who stood nearest to him gave well-sounding answers. The rest  were sorry and silent, for the war seemed to have lost them the  largess that had always been usual even in peace. Everybody agrees  that they could have been won over had the parsimonious old emperor  made the least display of generosity. He was ruined by his strict  old-fashioned inflexibility, which seems too rigorous for these  degenerate days.    From the camp they proceeded to the senate, and Galba's speech to       19  its members was no fuller or finer than to the soldiers. Piso spoke  graciously, and there was no lack of support in the senate. Many  wished him well. Those who did not were the more effusive. The  majority were indifferent, but displayed a ready affability, intent on  their private speculations without thought of the country's good. No  other public action is reported of Piso during the four days which  intervened between his adoption and assassination.
