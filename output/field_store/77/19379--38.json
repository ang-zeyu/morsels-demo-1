It seems to me that the main fault in the discussions going on in       the papers is the permanent ventilating of so-called two to three       or more power standard and then only exemplifying on one power,       which is invariably Germany. It is fair to suppose that each nation       builds and commissions its navy according to its needs and not only       with regard to the programme of other countries. Therefore, it       would be the simplest thing for England to say: \"I have a       world-wide empire and the greatest trade of the world, and to       protect them I must have so and so many battleships, cruisers, &c.,       as are necessary to guarantee the supremacy of the sea to me, and       they shall, accordingly, be built and manned.\"         That is the absolute right of your country, and nobody anywhere       would lose a word about it, and whether it be 60 or 90 or 100       battleships, that would make no difference and certainly no change       in the German naval bill. May the numbers be as you think fit,       everybody here would understand it, but the people would be very       thankful over here if at last Germany was left out of the       discussion, for it is very galling to the Germans to see their       country continually held up as the sole danger and menace to Great       Britain by the whole press of the different contending parties,       considering that other countries are building, too, and there are       even larger fleets than the German.    Fears German Retaliation.         Doubtless, when party faction runs high there is often a lamentable       lack of discrimination in the choice of weapons, but I really must       protest that the German naval programme should be only one for her       exclusive use, or that such a poisoned view should be forged as a       German challenge to British supremacy of the sea. If permanently       used mischief may be created at home, and the injured feeling       engendering the wish for retaliation in the circle of the German       Naval League as a representative of the nation which would       influence public opinion and place the Government in a very       disagreeable position by trying to force it to change its programme       through undue pressure, difficult to ignore.         In a letter which Lord Esher caused to be published a short time       ago he wrote that every German, from the Emperor down to the last       man, wished for the downfall of Sir John Fisher. Now I am at a loss       to tell whether the supervision of the foundations and drains of       royal palaces is apt to qualify somebody for the judgment of naval       affairs in general. As far as regards German affairs, the phrase is       a piece of unmitigated balderdash, and has created immense       merriment in the circles of those here who know. But I venture to       think that such things ought not to be written by people who are       high placed, as they are liable to hurt public feelings over here.         Of course I need not assure you that nobody here dreams of wishing       to influence Great Britain in the choice of those to whom she means       to give the direction of her navy or to disturb them in the       fulfillment of their noble task. It is expected that the choice       will always fall on the best and ablest, and their deeds will be       followed with interest and admiration by their brother officers in       the German Navy.         It is, therefore, preposterous to infer that the German authorities       work for or against persons in official positions in foreign       countries. It is as ridiculous as it is untrue, and I hereby       repudiate such calumny. Besides, to my humble notion, this       perpetual quoting of the German danger is utterly unworthy of the       great British Nation, with its world-wide empire and mighty navy.       There is something nearly ludicrous about it. The foreigners in       other countries might easily conclude that Germans must be an       exceptionally strong lot, as they seem to be able to strike terror       into the hearts of the British, who are five times their superiors.         I hope your Lordship will read these lines with kind consideration.       They are written by one who is an ardent admirer of your splendid       navy, who wishes it all success, and who hopes that its ensign may       ever wave on the same side as the German Navy's, and by one who is       proud to wear a British naval uniform of Admiral of the Fleet,       which was conferred on him by the late great Queen of blessed       memory.         Once more the German naval bill is not aimed at England and is not       a challenge to British supremacy of the sea, which will remain       unchallenged for generations to come. Let us all remember the       warning Admiral Sir John Fisher gave to his hearers in November,       when so cleverly he cautioned them not to get scared by using the       admirable phrase \"if Eve had not always kept her eye on the apple       she would not have eaten it, and we should not now be bothered with       clothes.\"         I remain yours truly,         WILLIAM I. R.,       Admiral of the Fleet.             *       *       *       *       *          Attacks Kaiser's Veracity.    The Morning Post, commenting on the letter of the Kaiser, says:         It is not usual for an Emperor to address a Minister of a foreign       country with reference to the affairs of his department. It is a       fact that it is not done. Lord Tweedmouth said the letter was a       private letter. The German Chancellor, Prince von Buelow, said the       letter partook of both a private and a political character. The       fact remains that it involved an extraordinary breach of etiquette.       There is no reflection cast upon the late Lord Tweedmouth. No one       can help receiving a letter from an Emperor if that monarch       condescends to dispatch it. Few persons, perhaps, could help being       influenced, albeit unconsciously influenced, by the perusal of such       an epistle.         Perhaps the German Emperor reflected upon that psychological       contingency; for to what conclusion is the whole tenor of the       letter directed? That the German Navy existed solely for purposes       of defense in case of aggression and for the protection of German       commerce, and that it was no part of German policy, and never had       been, to menace the sea power of Britain.         Now turn to the notorious preamble of the German navy law of 1900,       which in his letter the Emperor cites as a guarantee of good faith.       It is there stated that the German Navy must be made so powerful       that it would be dangerous for any nation, even the strongest       maritime nation, to attack it.         If that is not a challenge, what is? Had it not been in terms a       challenge the preamble would surely have run that it was not the       intention to make the German Navy so strong that the strongest       naval power could not attack it without danger to that power.             *       *       *       *       *          The Mighty Fate of Europe    As Interpreted by Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, German Imperial  Chancellor.               *       *       *       *       *          \"YOUR HEARTS FOR GOD, YOUR FISTS ON THE ENEMY.\"    Speech from Balcony of Chancellor's Official Residence,  Berlin, Aug. 1.           At this serious hour in order to give expression to your feelings       for your Fatherland you have come to the house of Bismarck, who       with Emperor William the Great and Field Marshal von Moltke welded       the German Empire for us.         We wished to go on living in peace in the empire which we have       developed in forty-four years of peaceful labor.         The whole work of Emperor William has been devoted to the       maintenance of peace. To the last hour he has worked for peace in       Europe, and he is still working for it. Should all his efforts       prove vain and should the sword be forced into our hands we will       take the field with a clear conscience in the knowledge that we did       not seek war. We shall then wage war for our existence and for the       national honor to the last drop of our blood.         In the gravity of this hour I remind you of the words of Prince       Frederick Charles to the men of Brandenburg:         \"Let your hearts beat for God and your fists on the enemy.\"             *       *       *       *       *          AS ONE MAN FOR THE KAISER.    Speech from Balcony of Royal Palace, Berlin, Aug. 2.           All stand as one man for our Kaiser, whatever our opinions or our       creeds. I am sure that all the young German men are ready to shed       their blood for the fame and greatness of Germany.

Because we were struggling       for the esteem of the German Empire in the world, we have for       forty-four years lived in peace and safeguarded the peace of       Europe. In peaceful industry we have become strong and mighty and       in consequence envied. With patience we have borne that, under the       pretext that Germany was desirous of war, hostility toward us was       being nursed and chains forged for us both in the East and in the       West.         We wished to continue to live in peaceful industry, and, like an       unexpressed vow, there was passed on from Kaiser to the youngest       soldier: \"Only in defense of a righteous cause shall our sword"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16342"],[0,"A Treatise on Simple Counterpoint in Forty Lessons (#5)"],[1,"species in one part, as previously  directed.    To cantus firmus _b_ write third species in two parts, as in Fig. 110_b_.  Write twice, changing the cantus firmus about.    Write one eight-measure phrase, mixing first and third species as in Fig.  110_a_.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 113.]          LESSON XVI    THIRD SPECIES (Continued)    EXERCISES      To the cantus firmus write third species in one part, as previously  directed.    Write one eight-measure phrase, mixing first and third species; also one  mixing first, second and third. [Fig. 114.]    Write one eight-measure phrase, using third species in all parts. [Fig.  110_c_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 114.]      CANTUS FIRMUS    [Illustration: Fig. 115.]          LESSON XVII    FOURTH SPECIES      [Illustration: Fig. 116.]    When the syncopation is a suspension or retardation, it is treated the same  as in harmony.    The retardation should always be prepared by the leading-tone.    When the syncopated note belongs to the harmony of the measure, it may be  left by a skip or stepwise progression. [Fig. 117.]    [Illustration: Fig. 117.]    The third may be omitted on the strong beat in this species, provided the  part having fourth species skips to the missing third, as at Fig. 117_a_.    Consecutive fifths, but not octaves, are saved by the suspension. Whenever  they occur, do not use the note of resolution as preparation of a  suspension, or tie it into the next measure (_a_), since it is really the  passing seventh, and that does not lend itself well to either of the above,  except in sequence as at _b_. [Fig. 118.]    [Illustration: Fig. 118.]    The seventh or ninth of a chord, except the major seventh, may be used as  preparation of a suspension when approached by a skip in an upward  direction, as in Fig. 119.    [Illustration: Fig. 119.]    This species may also be written in triple rhythm. [Fig. 120.]    [Illustration: Fig. 120.]    The cadences in Fig. 121 are good, as well as those of the second species.    [Illustration: Fig. 121.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write fourth species in one part. Write three  settings, as usual.    To cantus firmus _b_ write fourth species in one part in triple rhythm.  Write three settings, as above.    To cantus firmus _b_ write second species in one part and third in the  other.

EXERCISES    To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write fifth species in one part. Write each  three times, as usual.

[Illustration: Fig. 130.]          LESSON XXII    FIFTH SPECIES IN ALL PARTS    EXERCISES      Write five eight-measure phrases with fifth species in all parts, making  use of imitation at the beginning as in Fig. 131. The imitation need only  be relative and continue for three or four notes. It is also well, when a  part uses a striking melodic figure, to have some other part imitate it  immediately after.    [Illustration: Fig. 131.]          SIMPLE COUNTERPOINT IN FOUR PARTS    LESSON XXIII      [Illustration: Fig. 132.]    No new suggestions are needed, except as follows: All covered fifths and  octaves permitted in harmony are allowed here. When the cantus firmus is in  the lowest part and the choice of the last chord but one is V4/3 or vii_6 deg.,  use the latter, as in Fig. 133.    [Illustration: Fig. 133.]      EXERCISES    To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write the first species in the other parts.  Write each four times, setting the cantus firmus in each part in turn.

To cantus firmus _b_ write the second species in one part. Write four  times, and change with each solution, so that both the cantus firmus and  the second species will appear in each part.

CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 146.]          LESSON XXX      [Illustration: Fig. 147.]      EXERCISES    To the cantus firmus write the fifth species in two parts. Write four  times, changing the cantus firmus into every part. [Fig. 147_a_.]    Write one eight-measure phrase mixing the second, third and fourth species  (_b_). Also write one exercise combining the first, second, third and  fourth species (_c_).      CANTUS FIRMUS    [Illustration: Fig. 148.]          LESSON XXXI      [Illustration: Fig. 149.]      EXERCISES    To the cantus firmus write the fifth species in all of the other parts.  [Fig. 149_a_.]    Write four eight-measure phrases with the fifth species in all parts. [Fig.  149_b_.]      CANTUS FIRMUS    [Illustration: Fig. 150.]      LESSON XXXII    [Illustration: Fig. 151.]      EXERCISES    Write six eight-measure phrases, using the fifth species in all the parts.  Let the parts begin one after the other in imitation. [Fig. 151.]          LESSON XXXIII    FLORID MELODIES AS CANTI FIRMI FREE HARMONIZATION IN TWO-PART  COUNTERPOINT      [Illustration: Fig. 152.]    Thus far, all notes in the measure foreign to the harmony on the first  beat were treated as dissonances. Now, the cantus firmus may be harmonized  at pleasure, the only restriction being that any tone foreign to the chord  with which it enters must be treated as a dissonance. [Fig. 152.]    It is not necessary that each part be strictly florid, but that the effect  of the parts as a whole should be so. This applies from this point to the  end of these lessons.    The suspension may now be a quarter-note, or its rhythmic equivalent. It  then comes on the first (_a_) or third (_b_) quarter of the measure, and  the resolution on the quarter following. The preparation should be as long  as, or longer than, the suspension. [Fig. 153.]    [Illustration: Fig. 153.]    The eighth-note as in Fig. 154_a_ is good. It should be used only on the  second half of a weak beat, and be preceded by a dotted quarter-note.  Sixteenth-notes may be used in place of the eighth-note, but should be  approached and left step-wise. [Fig. 154_b_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 154.]    The first species may be employed occasionally in the course of an  exercise.    Make plentiful use of imitation.    When more than one line of a choral is used, it may be treated by having  the other parts continue through the holds, as at _a_, or letting them  rest, as at _b_. [Fig. 155.]    When, in place of the hold, the movement continues, it is necessary to  interpolate a full measure in place of the hold. [Fig. 155 and "]]]
