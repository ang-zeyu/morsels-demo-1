The exterior surface of  the walls is rough, as shown in the illustrations, but the interior  walls of the rooms are finished with a remarkable degree of smoothness,  so much so as to attract the attention of everyone who has visited the  ruin. Mange, who saw the ruin with Padre Font in 1697, says the walls  shine like Puebla pottery, and they still retain this finish wherever  the surface has not cracked off. This fine finish is shown in a number  of illustrations herewith. The walls are not of even thickness. At the  ground level the exterior wall is from 31/2 to 41/2 feet thick, and in one  place at the southern end of the eastern wall, is a trifle over 5 feet  thick. The interior walls are from 3 to 4 feet thick at base. At the top  the walls are reduced to about 2 feet thick, partly by setbacks or steps  at the floor levels, partly by exterior batter, the interior wall  surface being approximately vertical. Some writers, noting the  inclination of the outer wall surface, and not seeing the interior, have  inferred that the walls leaned considerably away from the perpendicular.  This inference has been strengthened, in some cases, by an examination  of the interior, for the inner wall surface, while finely finished, is  not by any means a plane surface, being generally concave in each room;  yet a line drawn from floor level to floor level would be very nearly  vertical. The building was constructed by crude methods, thoroughly  aboriginal in character, and there is no uniformity in its measurements.  The walls, even in the same room, are not of even thickness, the floor  joists were seldom on a straight line, and measurements made at similar  places, e.g., the two ends of a room, seldom agree.    [Illustration: Pl. LV: West Front of Casa Grande Ruin.]    A series of precise measurements gives the following results: Outside  eastern wall, at level 3 feet above center of depressed area adjoining  the ruin on the east, 59 feet; western wall at same level, 59 feet 1  inch; northern and southern walls, at same level, 42 and 43 feet  respectively. These measurements are between points formed by the  intersection of the wall lines; the northeastern and southeastern  corners having fallen, the actual length of standing wall is less. At  the level stated the northern wall measures but 34 feet 4 inches, and  the southern wall 36 feet 10 inches. A similar irregularity is found in  the interior measurements of rooms. The middle room is marked by an  exceptional departure from regularity in shape and dimensions. Both the  east and west walls are bowed eastward, making the western wall convex  and the eastern wall concave in reference to the room.    Precise measurements of the middle room at the second floor level, 8  feet above the base previously stated, are as follows: Eastern side, 24  feet 81/2 inches; western side, 24 feet 2 inches; northern side, 9 feet 31/2  inches; southern side, 9 feet 1 inch. The eastern room is a little more  regular, but there is a difference of 11 inches between the measurements  of the northern and southern ends. A similar difference is found in the  western room, amounting there to 6 inches. The northern and southern  rooms do not afford as good bases for comparison, as a corner is missing  in each; but measurements to a point where the interior wall surfaces  would intersect if prolonged, show variations of from 6 inches to a  foot. The statement that the ruin exhibits exceptional skill in  construction on the part of the builders, is not, therefore, supported  by facts.      _Detailed Description._    The Casa Grande ruin is often referred to as an adobe structure. Adobe  construction, if we limit the word to its proper meaning, consists of  the use of molded brick, dried in the sun but not baked. Adobe, as thus  defined, is very largely used throughout the southwest, more than nine  out of ten houses erected by the Mexican population and many of those  erected by the Pueblo Indians being so constructed; but, in the  experience of the writer, it is never found in the older ruins, although  seen to a limited extent in ruins known to belong to a period subsequent  to the Spanish conquest. Its discovery, therefore, in the Casa Grande  would be important; but no trace of it can be found. The walls are  composed of huge blocks of earth, 3 to 5 feet long, 2 feet high, and 3  to 4 feet thick. These blocks were not molded and placed in situ, but  were manufactured in place. The method adopted was probably the erection  of a framework of canes or light poles, woven with reeds or grass,  forming two parallel surfaces or planes, some 3 or 4 feet apart and  about 5 feet long. Into this open box or trough was rammed clayey earth  obtained from the immediate vicinity and mixed with water to a heavy  paste. When the mass was sufficiently dry, the framework was moved along  the wall and the operation repeated. This is the typical pise or  rammed-earth construction, and in the hands of skilled workmen it  suffices for the construction of quite elaborate buildings. As here  used, however, the appliances were rude and the workmen unskilled. An  inspection of the illustrations herewith, especially of plate LV,  showing the western wall of the ruin, will indicate clearly how this  work was done. The horizontal lines, marking what may be called courses,  are very well defined, and, while the vertical joints are not apparent  in the illustration, a close inspection of the wall itself shows them.  It will be noticed that the builders were unable to keep straight  courses, and that occasional thin courses were put in to bring the wall  up to a general level. This is even more noticeable in other parts of  the ruin. It is probable that as the walls rose the exterior surface was  smoothed with the hand or with some suitable implement, but it was not  carefully finished like the interior, nor was it treated like the latter  with a specially prepared material. The material employed for the walls  was admirably suited for the purpose, being when dry almost as hard as  sandstone and practically indestructible. The manner in which such walls  disintegrate under atmospheric influences has already been set forth in  detail in this report. An inhabited structure with walls like these  would last indefinitely, provided occupancy continued and a few slight  repairs, which would accompany occupancy, were made at the conclusion of  each rainy season. When abandoned, however, sapping at the ground level  would commence, and would in time level all the walls; yet in the two  centuries which have elapsed since Padre Kino's visit--and the Casa  Grande was then a ruin--there has been but little destruction, the  damage done by relic hunters in the last twenty years being in fact much  greater than that wrought by the elements in the preceding two  centuries. The relic hunters seem to have had a craze for wood, as the  lintels of openings and even the stumps of floor joists have been torn  out and carried away. The writer has been reliably informed that as late  as twenty years ago a portion of the floor or roof in one of the rooms  was still in place, but at the present day nothing is left of the floors  except marks on the vertical walls, and a few stumps of floor joists,  deeply imbedded in the walls, and so high that they can not be seen from  the ground.    [Illustration: Pl. LVI: Interior Wall of Casa Grande Ruin.]    The floors of the rooms, which were also the roofs of the rooms below,  were of the ordinary pueblo type, employed also today by the American  and Mexican population of this region. In the Casa Grande ruin a series  of light joists or heavy poles was laid across the shorter axis of the  room at the time the walls were erected; these poles were 3 to 6 inches  in diameter, not selected or laid with unusual care, as the holes in the  side walls which mark the places they occupied are seldom in a straight  line, and their shape often indicates that the poles were quite crooked.  Better executed examples of the same construction are often found in  northern ruins. Over the primary series of joists was placed a layer of  light poles, 11/2 to 2 inches in diameter, and over these reeds and coarse  grass were spread. The prints of the light poles can still be seen on  the walls. The floor or roof was then finished with a heavy coating of  clay, trodden down solid and smoothed to a level. A number of blocks of  this final floor finish, bearing the impress of the grass and reeds,  were found in the middle room. There is usually a setback in the wall at  the floor level, but this practice was not followed in all the rooms.    The position of the floor is well marked in all cases by holes in the  wall, into which beams projected sometimes to a depth of 3 feet, and by  a peculiar roughness of the wall. Plate LVI shows two floor levels, both  set back slightly and the upper one strongly marked by the roughness  mentioned. This roughness apparently marks the thickness of the floor in  some cases, yet in others it is much too thick for a floor and must have  had some other purpose. The relation of these marks to the beam holes  suggests that in some cases there was a low and probably narrow bench  around two or more sides of the room; such benches are often found in  the present Pueblo villages.    The walls of the northern room are fairly well preserved, except in the  northeastern corner, which has fallen. The principal floor beams were of  necessity laid north and south, across the shorter axis of the room,  while the secondary series of poles, 11/2 inches in diameter, have left  their impression in the eastern and western walls. There is no setback  in the northern wall at the first floor level, though there is a very  slight one in the southern wall; none appears in the eastern and western  walls. Yet in the second roof level there is a double setback of 9 and 5  inches"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17488"],[0,"The Repair of Casa Grande Ruin, Arizona, in 1891 (#5)"],[1,"perform and execute the work upon the Casa Grande ruin, described  and specified in the specification hereto annexed and forming a part  hereof, in the manner and with the conditions specified, items of said  work to be as follows:    Item No. 1.

PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE CASA GRANDE  RUIN, ARIZONA, 1891    (_Attached to and forming part of contract_)    GENERAL REQUIREMENTS    All the work upon this ruin is to be carried out in such a manner as to  interfere as little as possible with the present condition and  appearance of the building, and the contractors will be held responsible  for any injury to it.    The work is to be carried on under a supervisor, acting for the United  States, who shall have power to reject any materials it is proposed to  use in the work which are not in his judgment equal to those specified,  and he shall have power to have torn down any work done which he has  reason to suspect is not such as required by the specifications, but if  such work shall prove upon inspection to have been well done the  contractor may make a charge of the amount which would have been allowed  for that part of the work had it passed inspection.    When the work is completed it must pass the final inspection of the  supervisor, or such person as the Secretary of the Interior may  designate for the purpose.    1. CLEARING OUT THE DEBRIS    The debris now filling up the interior is to be removed down to the  floor level, or the original ground level. The debris covering an area  measuring 10 feet from the exterior walls of the building in every  direction is also to be removed. This work is to be carried on in  conjunction with the underpinning of the walls, and is to be dependent  upon the progress of the latter, the work being done as required by the  person holding the contract for the underpinning. All proper precautions  must be observed during the progress of the work to prevent any injury  to the building, the walls being properly braced and supported before  excavation is commenced. The contractor will be held responsible for any  injury to the building. Any objects found of archeologic or other value  properly belong to the United States and must be deposited in the  National Museum. The material removed from the building and from the  area about it is to be removed to a proper distance, not less than 100  yards from the building. Proper drainage channels must be provided to  keep the excavated area permanently clear of water.    2. UNDERPINNING WALLS    The walls where eroded at the ground level are to be underpinned with  hard-burned brick, laid in good cement mortar and extending to a depth  of at least 12 inches below the original ground level. This work must be  carried on gradually and very carefully in conjunction with the clearing  out of the debris. The under surfaces of the overhanging walls must be  carefully trimmed to afford solid horizontal bearings against the  brickwork. The face of the brickwork is to be set back at least 1 inch  and not more than 2 inches from the face of the wall, and the brickwork  is to be plastered with a coating of cement mortar, 1 to 2 inches thick,  bringing it out flush with the outer wall.    3. FILLING IN OPENINGS    The broken-out lintels of openings are to be replaced by wooden lintels  composed of squared lumber, 2 by 4 inches in size, laid side by side  across nearly the whole thickness of the walls, with not more than 1  inch space between the boards, and of the same length as the original  lintels. The broken-out walls are to be trimmed to afford solid resting  places for the new lintels, which are to occupy the same horizontal  planes that the old ones did. The openings above the lintels are to be  filled in in the same manner as the underpinning previously described,  the tinder wall surfaces being carefully dressed to afford solid  horizontal bearings, the brick work being set back 1 inch from the wall  surfaces and plastered with a coating of cement mortar to bring it out  flush with the wall.    4. BRACING    One wooden brace and two iron braces are to be put in, as shown upon the  plan hereto annexed. The wooden brace is to be of one piece, or of two  pieces well bolted together, of selected lumber, free from knots and  other imperfections, squared, and measuring 6 by 8 inches in cross  section. The iron braces are to be of 1 inch diameter, best quality"]]]
