He  wished to build more temples in Egypt than any other king had ever  built, so that wherever the traveler might turn people would point to  this or that great building and say Rameses II built that. To put up  these buildings he enslaved his people, compelling them to labor  without pay. To raise the funds for building materials he made war on  his neighbors, especially the Hittites in western Asia north of  Canaan. Again and again Hebrew children would see the dust of marching  armies over the roads past their pastures and men would say, \"Rameses  is going to war again.\" And by and by, weeks or months later, the  soldiers would return with tales of bloody battles and sometimes laden  with spoils.    =Enslavement of the Hebrews.=--Now, wars usually breed more wars.  Rameses having attacked the Hittites was afraid they would attack him.  Egypt was indeed very well protected from attack. There was only one  gateway into the country, and that was by way of the narrow Isthmus of  Suez. And there were a wall and a row of fortresses across the  isthmus. But who were those shepherd tribes living just west of the  isthmus inside the gateway? They are Hebrews, Rameses was told. They  are immigrants from Canaan. \"Look out for them,\" said Rameses. \"If  they came from Canaan, they may favor the Hittites and help them to  get past my fortresses into Egypt. Let them be put at work so that  they will have no time for plots.\"    Rameses was planning just then to build two large granary cities near  the northeastern border to be a base of supplies for his armies on  their campaigns into Asia. One was to be called Pithom.[2]    So one day armed men came to the Hebrew tents and the order was given  to send such and such a number of men to work in the brick-molds of  Pa-Tum. And they had to go. The women and the children had to care for  the sheep while most of their men trod the clay and straw in the brick  molds at Pa-Tum and carried heavy loads of brick on their shoulders to  the masons on the walls. Of course the sheep suffered for lack of  care. The children also pined from neglect. Life for the Hebrews  became a grinding treadmill of hardship and weariness and drudgery.      THE BOYHOOD AND YOUTH OF MOSES    During this time of oppression a Hebrew baby boy was by chance adopted  by one of the princesses in Pharaoh's court and brought up by his own  mother as his nurse. He was given an Egyptian name with the common  Egyptian ending Mesu or M-ses, as in Rameses. The boy was given all  the educational advantages that the Egyptian palace could offer. But  all the time in secret from his mother he was learning the story of  his own people and their wrongs, and was being trained to hate their  oppressors. One day after he had grown to manhood he went down to the  city of Pa-Tum to see the work on the new granaries which were being  built. Here he saw one of his own people being flogged by an Egyptian  overseer. In a fury he leaped to the man's defense and killed the  Egyptian. Of course Rameses heard of it, and Moses had to flee from  Egypt into the desert. In the desert he found a shepherd clan related  to the Hebrews and lived there for some years brooding over the hard  plight of his people.    =Moses' call and the struggle for freedom.=--One day in the desert,  Moses heard from a passing caravan that old Rameses II was dead. Like  a flame that burned but did not consume the thought came to him: \"Now  is your chance! The king and his officers will not know about you. Go  back to Egypt and lead your kinsmen out to freedom. This is God's call  and God will help you.\"    So back to Egypt he went. First, he undertook to rally his own people,  promising the help of their God, Jehovah. It was a dangerous  undertaking that he proposed. The kings of Egypt were accustomed to  make short work of those who resisted their authority. Moreover, these  Hebrews had been slaves for years, and their spirits might have been  cowed and broken. Yet they believed in Moses and his assurances and  accepted him as their leader.    Soon thereafter Moses and his brother Aaron went boldly to the palace  of the Pharaoh and declared to him that Jehovah, the God of the  Hebrews, had commanded that the Hebrews be allowed to hold a religious  festival in the desert to offer sacrifices unto him as their God. The  plan no doubt was that the people should escape once they were outside  the boundaries of Egypt; Moses evidently considered any method  justifiable in the effort to outwit the oppressor. But the Pharaoh  answered, \"Who is Jehovah that I should hearken to his voice to let  Israel go?\" The request was sharply refused. It is surprising that  Moses himself was not arrested and imprisoned on the spot. Perhaps he  still had friends in the Egyptian court. Or perhaps the Egyptians had  a certain reverence for him as a messenger from a god, even though  they did not grant his demands.    =Bricks without straw.=--At first it seemed that Moses had failed. For  instead of the longed-for freedom, the toiling Hebrews found that a  still heavier burden of work was laid upon them. In the manufacture of  sun-dried brick it is necessary to mix straw with the clay in the  molds, the fibers giving a tougher quality to the product. Previously  the straw for this purpose had been furnished by the Egyptians. But  now the order was, \"Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it.\"  So they had to go and hunt through the surrounding fields for old  refuse straw, in rotting ricks and compost heaps. Yet the same number  of bricks was required as before, with a whipping in case of failure.    The granaries in Pa-Tum and Rameses were excavated many years ago from  beneath the sands of Egypt, and their ruined walls may still be seen  by tourists. It is noticeable that the upper tiers in the walls are  made of bricks of a very poor quality as compared to those in the  lower tiers. Evidently, the Hebrews got through the work somehow each  day, putting very little straw in the clay, or sometimes none at all.    But they wished they had never heard of Moses, and they reproached him  for \"making them hateful in the eyes of Pharaoh.\" In the first round  of the fight Moses and freedom had lost; Pharaoh and slavery had won.  But the end was not yet.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Look up in any good Bible dictionary, the article on Egypt; or read  the summary of Egyptian history in some recent general history.    2. Draw a map of Egypt, locating approximately the place where the  Hebrews worked.    3. In what special ways was Moses well trained to be an emancipator  for his people?    4. Are there workers to-day who are in any form of slavery which may  be compared to that of the Hebrews in Egypt?    5. Are there any Pharaohs to-day? Any Moseses?      FOOTNOTES:    [1] See Chapter I, and Genesis 46 and 47.    [2] Exodus I. 1-11, or Pa-Tum in Egyptian; the other Rameses, after  the king himself. It was decided to compel the Hebrews to do the work  of brickmaking for these new cities.          CHAPTER V    A GREAT DELIVERANCE      Egypt has never been a health resort. The intensely hot summers breed  germs of disease, and also the insects which often carry them.  Throughout its history the country has been ravaged periodically by  fearful epidemics. A series of these pestilences predicted by Moses  and declared to be Jehovah's punishment for the enslavement of the  Israelites, made it possible for him to lead his people out of  slavery. So severe were the plagues that the government was for a time  disorganized. Taking advantage of their opportunity, the Hebrews  suddenly gathered up their possessions and set out toward the desert,  driving their sheep and goats before them. In spite of the large  figures given in some passages of Exodus, other statements indicate  that they were not very numerous, a few thousand at most, and they  doubtless hoped to slip out past the border fortresses, at night,  unnoticed. As they approached the border, however, news came that they  were being pursued by a troop of horsemen. This meant, of course, that  a watch would be made for them at the fortresses also. They were  caught in a trap, and turned in despair upon Moses, who could only  once more assure them that Jehovah was leading them, and would somehow  open the way.      THE STRONG EAST WIND AND ITS RESULT    That night they encamped on the western shore of one of the shallow  bays or lakes at the head of the Red Sea. To the east was the water.  North of the lake the wall and the line of fortresses began. Behind  them they could already see where their pursuers were camping for the  night. In the morning--terror, death, and return to slavery!    =A path through the sea.=--During the night, however, someone came in  from the shore of the lake with the astonishing news that it was going  dry. A strong east wind was blowing, with an effect often observed by  modern travelers, namely, that the comparatively shallow waters were  being driven back into the deeper part of the sea. Instantly the word  of command was given. With the women and children first and the flocks  next, they picked their way through the mud and sand and rocks on the  lake bottom, clear across to the other side. The next morning the wind  changed, the waters returned, and many of their pursuers were drowned.    The feelings of the Hebrews are expressed in the words of the triumph  song in which through all later centuries they celebrated this  deliverance:        =\"I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously:      The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.=             *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *      =Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea;      And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.\"=      INFLUENCE OF THE EXODUS ON HEBREW RELIGION    It was indeed a notable deliverance, and the Hebrews never forgot it.  It affected their ideals and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18193"],[0,"Ways of Wood Folk (#5)"],[1," had him. In a hungry moment he had driven his bill  through both shells of a scallop, which slipped or worked its way up  to his nostrils, muzzling the bird perfectly with a hard shell ring.  The poor fellow by desperate trying could open his mouth barely wide  enough to drink or to swallow the tiniest morsel. He must have been in  this condition a long time, for the bill was half worn through, and he  was so light that the wind blew him about like a great feather when he  attempted to fly.    Fortunately Don was a good retriever and had brought the duck in with  scarcely a quill ruffled; so I had the satisfaction of breaking his  bands and letting him go free with a splendid rush. But the wind was  too much for him; he dropped back into the water and went skittering  down the harbor like a lady with too much skirt and too big a hat in  boisterous weather. Meanwhile Don lay on the sand, head up, ears up,  whining eagerly for the word to fetch. Then he dropped his head, and  drew a long breath, and tried to puzzle it out why a man should go out  on a freezing day in February, and tramp, and row, and get wet to find  a bird, only to let him go after he had been fairly caught.    Kwaseekho the shelldrake leads a double life. In winter he may be  found almost anywhere along the Massachusetts coast and southward,  where he leads a dog's life of it, notwithstanding his gay  appearance. An hundred guns are roaring at him wherever he goes. From  daylight to dark he has never a minute to eat his bit of fish, or to  take a wink of sleep in peace. He flies to the ocean, and beds with  his fellows on the broad open shoals for safety. But the east winds  blow; and the shoals are a yeasty mass of tumbling breakers. They  buffet him about; they twist his gay feathers; they dampen his  pinions, spite of his skill in swimming. Then he goes to the creeks  and harbors.    Along the shore a flock of his own kind, apparently, are feeding in  quiet water. Straight in he comes with unsuspecting soul, the morning  light shining full on his white breast and bright red feet as he  steadies himself to take the water. But _bang, bang!_ go the guns; and  _splash, splash!_ fall his companions; and out of a heap of seaweed  come a man and a dog; and away he goes, sadly puzzled at the painted  things in the water, to think it all over in hunger and sorrow.    Then the weather grows cold, and a freeze-up covers all his feeding  grounds. Under his beautiful feathers the bones project to spoil the  contour of his round plump body. He is famished now; he watches the  gulls to see what they eat. When he finds out, he forgets his caution,  and roams about after stray mussels on the beach. In the spring  hunger drives him into the ponds where food is plenty--but such food!  In a week his flesh is so strong that a crow would hardly eat it.  Altogether, it is small wonder that as soon as his instinct tells him  the streams of the North are open and the trout running up, he is off  to a land of happier memories.    In summer he forgets his hardships. His life is peaceful as a meadow  brook. His home is the wilderness--on a lonely lake, it may be,  shimmering under the summer sun, or kissed into a thousand smiling  ripples by the south wind. Or perhaps it is a forest river, winding on  by wooded hills and grassy points and lonely cedar swamps. In secret  shallow bays the young broods are plashing about, learning to swim and  dive and hide in safety. The plunge of the fish-hawk comes up from the  pools. A noisy kingfisher rattles about from tree to stump, like a  restless busy-body. The hum of insects fills the air with a drowsy  murmur. Now a deer steps daintily down the point, and looks, and  listens, and drinks. A great moose wades awkwardly out to plunge his  head under and pull away at the lily roots. But the young brood mind  not these harmless things. Sometimes indeed, as the afternoon wears  away, they turn their little heads apprehensively as the alders crash  and sway on the bank above; a low cluck from the mother bird sends  them all off into the grass to hide. How quickly they have  disappeared, leaving never a trace! But it is only a bear come down  from the ridge where he has been sleeping, to find a dead fish  perchance for his supper; and the little brood seem to laugh as  another low cluck brings them scurrying back from their hiding places.    Once, perhaps, comes a real fright, when all their summer's practice  is put to the test. An unusual noise is heard; and round the bend  glides a bark canoe with sound of human voices. Away go the brood  together, the river behind them foaming like the wake of a tiny  steamer as the swift-moving feet lift them almost out of water.  Visions of ocean, the guns, falling birds, and the hard winter  distract the poor mother. She flutters wildly about the brood, now  leading, now bravely facing the monster; now pushing along some weak  little loiterer, now floundering near the canoe as if wounded, to  attract attention from the young. But they double the point at last,  and hide away under the alders. The canoe glides by and makes no  effort to find them. Silence is again over the forest. The little  brood come back to the shallows, with mother bird fluttering round  them to count again and again lest any be missing. The kingfisher  comes out of his hole in the bank. The river flows on as before, and  peace returns; and over all is the mystic charm of the wilderness and  the quiet of a summer day.    This is the way it all looks and seems to me, sitting over under the  big hemlock, out of sight, and watching the birds through my  field-glass.    Day after day I have attended such little schools unseen and  unsuspected by the mother bird. Sometimes it was the a-b-c class, wee  little downy fellows, learning to hide on a lily pad, and never  getting a reward of merit in the shape of a young trout till they hid  so well that the teacher (somewhat over-critical, I thought) was  satisfied. Sometimes it was the baccalaureates that displayed their  talents to the unbidden visitor, flashing out of sight, cutting  through the water like a ray of light, striking a young trout on the  bottom with the rapidity and certainty almost of the teacher. It was  marvelous, the diving and swimming; and mother bird looked on and  quacked her approval of the young graduates.--That is another  peculiarity: the birds are dumb in winter; they find their voice only  for the young.    While all this careful training is going on at home, the drake is off  on the lakes somewhere with his boon companions, having a good time,  and utterly neglectful of parental responsibility. Sometimes I have  found clubs of five or six, gay fellows all, living by themselves at  one end of a big lake where the fishing was good. All summer long  they roam and gad about, free from care, and happy as summer campers,  leaving mother birds meanwhile to feed and educate their offspring.  Once only have I seen a drake sharing the responsibilities of his  family. I watched three days to find the cause of his devotion; but he  disappeared the third evening, and I never saw him again. Whether the  drakes are lazy and run away, or whether they have the atrocious habit  of many male birds and animals of destroying their young, and so are  driven away by the females, I have not been able to find out.    These birds are very destructive on the trout streams; if a summer  camper spare them, it is because of his interest in the young, and  especially because of the mother bird's devotion. When the recreant  drake is met with, however, he goes promptly onto the bill of fare,  with other good things.    Occasionally one overtakes a brood on a rapid river. Then the poor  birds are distressed indeed. At the first glimpse of the canoe they  are off, churning the water into foam in their flight. Not till they  are out of sight round the bend do they hear the cluck that tells them  to hide. Some are slow in finding a hiding place on the strange  waters. The mother bird hurries them. They are hunting in frantic  haste when round the bend comes the swift-gliding canoe. With a note  of alarm they are all off again, for she will not leave even the  weakest alone. Again they double the bend and try to hide; again the  canoe overtakes them; and so on, mile after mile, till a stream or  bogan flowing into the river offers a road to escape. Then, like a  flash, the little ones run in under shelter of the banks, and glide up  stream noiselessly, while mother bird flutters on down the river just  ahead of the canoe. Having lured it away to a safe distance, as she  thinks, she takes wing and returns to the young.    Their powers of endurance are remarkable. Once, on the Restigouche, we  started a brood of little ones late in the afternoon. We were moving  along in a good current, looking for a camping ground, and had little  thought for the birds, which could never get far enough ahead to hide  securely. For five miles they kept ahead of us, rushing out at each  successive stretch of water, and fairly distancing us in a straight  run. When we camped they were still below us. At dusk I was sitting  motionless near the river when a slight movement over near the  opposite bank attracted me. There was the mother bird, stealing along  up stream under the fringe of bushes. The young followed in single  file. There was no splashing of water now. Shadows were not more  noiseless.    Twice since then I have seen them do the same thing. I have no doubt  they returned that evening all the way up to the feeding grounds where  we first started them; for like the kingfishers every bird seems to  have his own piece of the stream. He never fishes in his neighbor's  pools, nor will he suffer any poaching in his own. On the Restigouche  we found a brood every few miles; on other rivers less plentifully  stocked with trout they are less numerous. On lakes there is often a  brood at either end; but"]]]
