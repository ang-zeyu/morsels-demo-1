[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#5)"],[1," back on the general run, or type, in assigning the different implements  each to its own stratum. Luckily, in the old days fashions tended to  be rigid; so that for the pre-historian two flints with slightly  different chipping may stand for separate ages of culture as clearly  as do a Greek vase and a German beer-mug for the student of more recent  times.           *       *       *       *       *    Enough concerning the stratigraphical method. A word, in the next place,  about the pre-historian's main sources of information. Apart from  geological facts, there are three main classes of evidence that serve  to distinguish one pre-historic epoch from another. These are animal  bones, human bones, and human handiwork.    Again I illustrate by means of a case of which I happen to have  first-hand knowledge. In Jersey, near the bay of St. Brelade, is a  cave, in which we dug down through some twenty feet of accumulated  clay and rock-rubbish, presumably the effects of the last throes of  the ice-age, and came upon a pre-historic hearth. There were the big  stones that had propped up the fire, and there were the ashes. By the  side were the remains of a heap of food-refuse. The pieces of decayed  bone were not much to look at; yet, submitted to an expert, they did  a tale unfold. He showed them to be the remains of the woolly rhinoceros,  the mammoth's even more unwieldy comrade, of the reindeer, of two kinds  of horse, one of them the pony-like wild horse still to be found in  the Mongolian deserts, of the wild ox, and of the deer. Truly there  was better hunting to be got in Jersey in the days when it formed part  of a frozen continent.    Next, the food-heap yields thirteen of somebody's teeth. Had they eaten  him? It boots not to inquire; though, as the owner was aged between  twenty and thirty, the teeth could hardly have fallen out of their  own accord. Such grinders as they are too! A second expert declares  that the roots beat all records. They are of the kind that goes with  an immensely powerful jaw, needing a massive brow-ridge to counteract  the strain of the bite, and in general involving the type of skull  known as the Neanderthal, big-brained enough in its way, but uncommonly  ape-like all the same.    Finally, the banqueters have left plenty of their knives lying about.  These good folk had their special and regular way of striking off a  broad flat flake from the flint core; the cores are lying about, too,  and with luck you can restore some of the flakes to their original  position. Then, leaving one side of the flake untouched, they trimmed  the surface of the remaining face, and, as the edges grew blunt with  use, kept touching them up with the hammer-stone--there it is also  lying by the hearth--until, perhaps, the flake loses its oval shape  and becomes a pointed triangle. A third expert is called in, and has  no difficulty in recognizing these knives as the characteristic  handiwork of the epoch known as the Mousterian. If one of these worked  flints from Jersey was placed side by side with another from the cave  of Le Moustier, near the right bank of the Vezere in south-central  France, whence the term Mousterian, you could hardly tell which was  which; whilst you would still see the same family likeness if you  compared the Jersey specimens with some from Amiens, or from Northfleet  on the Thames, or from Icklingham in Suffolk.    Putting all these kinds of evidence together, then, we get a notion,  doubtless rather meagre, but as far as it goes well-grounded, of a  hunter of the ice-age, who was able to get the better of a woolly  rhinoceros, could cook a lusty steak off him, had a sharp knife to  carve it, and the teeth to chew it, and generally knew how, under the  very chilly circumstances, both to make himself comfortable and to  keep his race going.    There is one other class of evidence on which the pre-historian may  with due caution draw, though the risks are certain and the profits  uncertain. The ruder peoples of to-day are living a life that in its  broad features cannot be wholly unlike the life of the men of long  ago. Thus the pre-historian should study Spencer and Gillen on the  natives of Central Australia, if only that he may take firm hold of  the fact that people with skulls inclining towards the Neanderthal  type, and using stone knives, may nevertheless have very active minds;  in short, that a rich enough life in its way may leave behind it a  poor rubbish-heap. When it comes, however, to the borrowing of details,  to patch up the holes in the pre-historic record with modern rags and  tatters makes better literature than science. After all, the  Australians, or Tasmanians, or Bushmen, or Eskimo, of whom so much  is beginning to be heard amongst pre-historians, are our  contemporaries--that is to say, have just as long an ancestry as  ourselves; and in the course of the last 100,000 years or so our stock  has seen so many changes, that their stocks may possibly have seen  a few also. Yet the real remedy, I take it, against the misuse of analogy  is that the student should make himself sufficiently at home in both  branches of anthropology to know each of the two things he compares  for what it truly is.           *       *       *       *       *    Having glanced at method and sources, I pass on to results. Some  text-book must be consulted for the long list of pre-historic periods  required for western Europe, not to mention the further complications  caused by bringing in the remaining portions of the world. The  stone-age, with its three great divisions, the eolithic (_eos_, Greek  for dawn, and _lithos_, stone) the palaeolithic (_pallaeos_, old),  and the neolithic (_neos_, new), and their numerous subdivisions,  comes first; then the age of copper and bronze; and then the early  iron-age, which is about the limit of proto-history. Here I shall  confine my remarks to Europe. I am not going far afield into such  questions as: Who were the mound-builders of North America? And are  the Calaveras skull and other remains found in the gold-bearing gravels  of California to be reckoned amongst the earliest traces of man in  the globe? Nor, again, must I pause to speculate whether the  dark-stained lustrous flint implements discovered by Mr. Henry Balfour  at a high level below the Victoria Falls, and possibly deposited there  by the river Zambezi before it had carved the present gorge in the  solid basalt, prove that likewise in South Africa man was alive and  busy untold thousands of years ago. Also, I shall here confine myself  to the stone-age, because my object is chiefly to illustrate the long  pedigree of the species from which we are all sprung.    The antiquity of man being my immediate theme, I can hardly avoid saying  something about eoliths; though the subject is one that invariably  sets pre-historians at each other's throats. There are eoliths and  eoliths, however; and some of M. Rutot's Belgian examples are  now-a-days almost reckoned respectable. Let us, nevertheless, inquire  whether eoliths are not to be found nearer home. I can wish the reader  no more delightful experience than to run down to Ightham in Kent,  and pay a call on Mr. Benjamin Harrison. In the room above what used  to be Mr. Harrison's grocery-store, eoliths beyond all count are on  view, which he has managed to amass in his rare moments of leisure.  As he lovingly cons the stones over, and shows off their points, his  enthusiasm is likely to prove catching. But the visitor, we shall  suppose, is sceptical. Very good; it is not far, though a stiffish  pull, to Ash on the top of the North Downs. Hereabouts are Mr.  Harrison's hunting-grounds. Over these stony tracts he has conducted  Sir Joseph Prestwich and Sir John Evans, to convince the one authority,  but not the other. Mark this pebbly drift of rusty-red colour spread  irregularly along the fields, as if the relics of some ancient stream  or flood. On the surface, if you are lucky, you may pick up an  unquestionable palaeolith of early type, with the rusty-red stain of  the gravel over it to show that it has lain there for ages. But both  on and below the surface, the gravel being perhaps from five to seven  feet deep, another type of stone occurs, the so-called eolith. It is  picked out from amongst ordinary stones partly because of its shape,  and partly because of rough and much-worn chippings that suggest the  hand of art or of nature, according to your turn of mind. Take one  by itself, explains Mr. Harrison, and you will be sure to rank it as  ordinary road-metal. But take a series together, and then, he urges,  the sight of the same forms over and over again will persuade you in  the end that human design, not aimless chance, has been at work here.    Well, I must leave Mr. Harrison to convert you into the friend or foe  of his eoliths, and will merely add a word in regard to the probable  age of these eolith-bearing gravels. Sir Joseph Prestwich has tried  to work the problem out. Now-a-days Kent and Sussex run eastwards in  five more or less parallel ridges, not far short of 1,000 feet high,  with deep valleys between. Formerly, however, no such valleys existed,  and a great dome of chalk, some 2,500 feet high at its crown, perhaps,  though others would say less, covered the whole country. That is why  rivers like the Darenth and Medway cut clean through the North Downs  and fall into the Thames, instead of flowing eastwards down the later  valleys. They started to carve their channels in the soft chalk in  the days gone by, when the watershed went north and south down the  slopes of the great dome. And the red gravels with the eoliths in them,  concludes Prestwich, must have come down the north slope whilst the  dome was still intact; for they contain fragments of stone that hail  from right across the present valleys. But, if the eoliths are man-made,  then man presumably killed game and cut it up on top of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17287"],[0,"History of France (#5)"],[1,"Valois admitted the other Charles, by  whom Marcel and his partisans were put to death. The attempt at reform  thus ended in talk and murder, and all fell back into the same state of  misery and oppression.      4. The Peace of Bretigny.--This Charles, eldest son of John, obtained  by purchase the imperial fief of Vienne, of which the counts had always  been called Dauphins, a title thenceforth borne by the heir apparent of  the kingdom. His father's captivity and the submission of Paris left  him master of the realm; but he did little to defend it when Edward III.  again attacked it, and in 1360 he was forced to bow to the terms which  the English king demanded as the price of peace. The Peace of Bretigny  permitted King John to ransom himself, but resigned to England the  sovereignty over the duchy of Aquitaine, and left Calais and Ponthieu in  the hands of Edward III. John died in 1364, before his ransom was paid,  and his son mounted the throne as _Charles V_. Charles showed himself  from this time a wary, able man, and did much to regain what had been  lost by craftily watching his opportunity. The war went on between the  allies of each party, though the French and English kings professed to  be at peace; and at the battle of Cocherel, in 1364, Charles the Bad was  defeated, and forced to make peace with France. On the other hand, the  French party in Brittany, led by Charles de Blois and the gallant Breton  knight, Bertrand du Guesclin, were routed, the same year, by the English  party under Sir John Chandos; Charles de Blois was killed, and the house  of Montfort established in the duchy. These years of war had created a  dreadful class of men, namely, hired soldiers of all nations, who, under  some noted leader, sold their services to whatever prince might need  them, under the name of Free Companies, and when unemployed lived by  plunder. The peace had only let these wretches loose on the peasants.  Some had seized castles, whence they could plunder travellers; others  roamed the country, preying on the miserable peasants, who, fleeced as  they were by king, barons, and clergy, were tortured and murdered by  these ruffians, so that many lived in holes in the ground that their  dwellings might not attract attention. Bertrand du Guesclin offered the  king to relieve the country from these Free Companies by leading them to  assist the Castilians against their tyrannical king, Peter the Cruel.  Edward, the Black Prince, who was then acting as Governor of Aquitaine,  took, however, the part of Peter, and defeated Du Guesclin at the battle  of Navarete, on the Ebro, in 1367.      5. Renewal of the War.--This expedition ruined the prince's health,  and exhausted his treasury. A hearth-tax was laid on the inhabitants of  Aquitaine, and they appealed against it to the King of France, although,  by the Peace of Bretigny, he had given up all right to hear appeals as  suzerain. The treaty, however, was still not formally settled, and on  this ground Charles received their complaint. The war thus began again,  and the sword of the Constable of France--the highest military dignity  of the realm--was given to Du Guesclin, but only on condition that he  would avoid pitched battles, and merely harass the English and take  their castles. This policy was so strictly followed, that the Duke of  Lancaster was allowed to march from Brittany to Gascony without meeting  an enemy in the field; and when King Edward III. made his sixth and last  invasion, nearly to the walls of Paris, he was only turned back by  famine, and by a tremendous thunderstorm, which made him believe that  Heaven was against him. Du Guesclin died while besieging a castle, and  such was his fame that the English captain would place the keys in no  hand but that of his corpse. The Constable's sword was given to Oliver  de Clisson, also a Breton, and called the \"Butcher,\" because he gave no  quarter to the English in revenge for the death of his brother. The  Bretons were, almost to a man, of the French party, having been offended  by the insolence and oppression of the English; and John de Montfort,  after clinging to the King of England as long as possible, was forced to  make his peace at length with Charles. Charles V. had nearly regained  all that had been lost, when, in 1380 his death left the kingdom to his  son.      6. House of Burgundy.--_Charles VI._ was a boy of nine years old,  motherless, and beset with ambitious uncles. These uncles were Louis,  Duke of Anjou, to whom Queen Joanna, the last of the earlier Angevin  line in Naples, bequeathed her rights; John, Duke of Berry, a weak  time-server; and Philip, the ablest and most honest of the three. His  grandmother Joan, the wife of Philip VI., had been heiress of the duchy  and county of Burgundy, and these now became his inheritance, giving him  the richest part of France. By still better fortune he had married  Margaret, the only child of Louis, Count of Flanders. Flanders contained  the great cloth-manufacturing towns of Europe--Ghent, Bruges, Ypres,  etc., all wealthy and independent, and much inclined to close alliance  with England, whence they obtained their wool, while their counts were  equally devoted to France. Just as Count Louis II. had, for his lawless  rapacity, been driven out of Ghent by Jacob van Arteveldt, so his son,  Louis III., was expelled by Philip van Arteveldt, son to Jacob. Charles  had been disgusted by Louis's coarse violence, and would not help him;  but after the old king's death, Philip of Burgundy used his influence in  the council to conduct the whole power of France to Flanders, where  Arteveldt was defeated and trodden to death in the battle of Rosbecque,  in 1382. On the count's death, Philip succeeded him as Count of Flanders  in right of his wife; and thus was laid the foundation of the powerful  and wealthy house of Burgundy, which for four generations almost  overshadowed the crown of France.      7. Insanity of Charles VI.--The Constable, Clisson, was much hated by  the Duke of Brittany, and an attack which was made on him in the  streets of Paris was clearly traced to Montfort. The young king, who was  much attached to Clisson, set forth to exact punishment. On his way, a  madman rushed out of a forest and called out, \"King, you are betrayed!\"  Charles was much frightened, and further seems to have had a sunstroke,  for he at once became insane. He recovered for a time; but at Christmas,  while he and five others were dancing, disguised as wild men, their  garments of pitched flax caught fire. Four were burnt, and the shock  brought back the king's madness. He became subject to fits of insanity  of longer or shorter duration, and in their intervals he seems to have  been almost imbecile. No provision had then been made for the  contingency of a mad king. The condition of the country became worse  than ever, and power was grasped at by whoever could obtain it. Of the  king's three uncles, the Duke of Anjou and his sons were generally  engrossed by a vain struggle to obtain Naples; the Duke of Berry was  dull and weak; and the chief struggle for influence was between Philip  of Burgundy and his son, John the Fearless, on the one hand, and on the  other the king's wife, Isabel of Bavaria, and his brother Louis, Duke of  Orleans, who was suspected of being her lover; while the unhappy king  and his little children were left in a wretched state, often scarcely  provided with clothes or food.      8. Burgundians and Armagnacs.--Matters grew worse after the death of  Duke Philip in 1404; and in 1407, just after a seeming reconciliation,  the Duke of Orleans was murdered in the streets of Paris by servants of  John the Fearless. Louis of Orleans had been a vain, foolish man,  heedless of all save his own pleasure, but his death increased the  misery of France through the long and deadly struggle for vengeance that  followed. The king was helpless, and the children of the Duke of Orleans  were young; but their cause was taken up by a Gascon noble, Bernard,  Count of Armagnac, whose name the party took. The Duke of Burgundy was  always popular in Paris, where the people, led by the Guild of Butchers,  were so devoted to him that he ventured to have a sermon preached at the  university, justifying the murder. There was again a feeble attempt at  reform made by the burghers; but, as before, the more violent and  lawless were guilty of such excesses that the opposite party were called  in to put them down. The Armagnacs were admitted into Paris, and took a  terrible vengeance on the Butchers and on all adherents of Burgundy, in  the name of the Dauphin Louis, the king's eldest son, a weak, dissipated  youth, who was entirely led by the Count of Armagnac.      9. Invasion of Henry V.--All this time the war with England had  smouldered on, only broken by brief truces; and when France was in this  wretched state Henry V. renewed the claim of Edward III., and in 1415  landed before Harfleur. After delaying till he had taken the city, the  dauphin called together the whole nobility of the kingdom, and advanced  against Henry, who, like Edward III., had been obliged to leave Normandy  and march towards Calais in search of supplies. The armies met at  Agincourt, where, though the French greatly outnumbered the English, the  skill of Henry and the folly and confusion of the dauphin's army led to  a total defeat, and the captivity of half the chief men in France of the  Armagnac party--among them the young Duke of Orleans. It was Henry V.'s  policy to treat France, not as a conquest, but as an inheritance; and he  therefore refused to let these captives be ransomed till he should have  reduced the country to obedience, while he treated all the places that  submitted to him with great kindness. The Duke of Burgundy held aloof  from the contest, and the Armagnacs, who ruled in Paris, were too weak  or too careless to send aid to Rouen, which was taken by Henry after a "]]]
