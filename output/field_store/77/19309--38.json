So she sat and pondered over these facts,  thinking what would be best to do, for as long as she was not the most  beautiful woman in the land, her jealousy gave her no peace. After a  time, she decided what to do. First, she painted her face, and whitened  her hair; then she dressed herself in old woman's clothes, and was so  disguised that no one could have recognised her.    Watching an opportunity, she left the castle, and took her way to the  wood near the mountains, where the seven little dwarfs lived. When she  reached the door, she knocked, and cried, \"Beautiful goods to sell;  beautiful goods to sell.\"    Snow-white, when she heard it, peeped through the window, and said,  \"Good-day, old lady. What have you in your basket for me to buy?\"    \"Everything that is pretty,\" she replied; \"laces, and pearls, and  earrings, and bracelets of every colour;\" and she held up her basket,  which was lined with glittering silk.    \"I can let in this respectable old woman,\" thought Snow-white; \"she will  not harm me.\" So she unbolted the door, and told her to come in. Oh, how  delighted Snow-white was with the pretty things; she bought several  trinkets, and a beautiful silk lace for her stays, but she did not see  the evil eye of the old woman who was watching her. Presently she said,  \"Child, come here; I will show you how to lace your stays properly.\"  Snow-white had no suspicion, so she placed herself before the old woman  that she might lace her stays. But no sooner was the lace in the holes  than she began to lace so fast and pull so tight that Snow-white could  not breathe, and presently fell down at her feet as if dead.    \"Now you are beautiful indeed,\" said the woman, and, fancying she heard  footsteps, she rushed away as quickly as she could.    Not long after, the seven dwarfs came home, and they were terribly  frightened to see dear little Snow-white lying on the ground without  motion, as if she were dead. They lifted her up, and saw in a moment  that her stays had been laced too tight. Quickly they cut the stay-lace  in two, till Snow-white began to breathe a little, and after a time was  restored to life. But when the dwarfs heard what had happened, they  said: \"That old market-woman was no other than your wicked stepmother.  Snow-white, you must never again let anyone in while we are not with  you.\"    The wicked queen when she returned home, after, as she thought, killing  Snow-white, went to her looking-glass and asked:        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Am I most beautiful of all?\"    Then answered the mirror:      \"Queen, thou art not the fairest now;     Snow-white over the mountain's brow     A thousand times fairer is than thou.\"    When she heard this she was so terrified that the blood rushed to her  heart, for she knew that after all she had done Snow-white was still  alive. \"I must think of something else,\" she said to herself, \"to get  rid of that odious child.\"    Now this wicked queen had some knowledge of witchcraft, and she knew how  to poison a comb, so that whoever used it would fall dead. This the  wicked stepmother soon got ready, and dressing herself again like an old  woman, but quite different from the last, she started off to travel over  the mountains to the dwarfs' cottage.    When Snow-white heard the old cry, \"Goods to sell, fine goods to sell,\"  she looked out of the window and said:    \"Go away, go away; I must not let you in.\"    \"Look at this, then,\" said the woman; \"you shall have it for your own if  you like,\" and she held up before the child's eyes the bright  tortoise-shell comb which she had poisoned.    Poor Snow-white could not refuse such a present, so she opened the door  and let the woman in, quite forgetting the advice of the dwarfs. After  she had bought a few things, the old woman said, \"Let me try this comb  in your hair; it is so fine it will make it beautifully smooth and  glossy.\"    So Snow-white, thinking no wrong, stood before the woman to have her  hair dressed; but no sooner had the comb touched the roots of her hair  than the poison took effect, and the maiden fell to the ground lifeless.    \"You paragon of beauty,\" said the wicked woman, \"all has just happened  as I expected,\" and then she went away quickly.    Fortunately evening soon arrived, and the seven dwarfs returned home.  When they saw Snow-white lying dead on the ground, they knew at once  that the stepmother had been there again; but on seeing the poisoned  comb in her hair they pulled it out quickly, and Snow-white very soon  came to herself, and related all that had passed.    Again they warned her not to let anyone enter the house during their  absence, and on no account to open the door; but Snow-white was not  clever enough to resist her clever wicked stepmother, and she forgot to  obey.    The wicked queen felt sure now that she had really killed Snow-white; so  as soon as she returned home she went to her looking-glass, and  inquired:        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Who is most beautiful of all?\"    But the mirror replied:      \"Queen, thou art the fairest here,     But not when Snow-white is near;     Over the mountains still is she,     Fairer a thousand times than thee.\"    As the looking-glass thus replied, the queen trembled and quaked with  rage. \"Snow-white shall die,\" cried she, \"if it costs me my own life!\"    Then she went into a lonely forbidden chamber where no one was allowed  to come, and poisoned a beautiful apple. Outwardly it looked ripe and  tempting, of a pale green with rosy cheeks, so that it made everyone's  mouth water to look at it, but whoever ate even a small piece must die.    As soon as this apple was ready, the wicked queen painted her face,  disguised her hair, dressed herself as a farmer's wife, and went again  over the mountains to the dwarfs' cottage.    When she knocked at the door, Snow-white stretched her head out of the  window, and said, \"I dare not let you in; the seven dwarfs have  forbidden me.\"    \"But I am all right,\" said the farmer's wife. \"Stay, I will show you my  apples. Are they not beautiful? let me make you a present of one.\"    \"No, thank you,\" cried Snow-white; \"I dare not take it.\"    \"What!\" cried the woman, \"are you afraid it is poisoned? Look here now,  I will cut the apple in halves; you shall have the rosy-cheek side, and  I will eat the other.\"    The apple was so cleverly made that the red side alone was poisonous.  Snow-white longed so much for the beautiful fruit as she saw the  farmer's wife eat one half that she could not any longer resist, but  stretched out her hand from the window and took the poisoned half. But  no sooner had she taken one mouthful than she fell on the ground dead.    Then the wicked queen glanced in at the window with a horrible look in  her eye, and laughed aloud as she exclaimed:    \"White as snow, red as blood, and black as ebony; this time the dwarfs  will not be able to awake thee.\"    And as soon as she arrived at home, and asked her mirror who was the  most beautiful in the land, it replied:      \"Fair queen, there is none in all the land     So beautiful as thou.\"    Then had her envious heart rest, at least such rest as a heart full of  envy and malice ever can have.    The little dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found poor  Snow-white on the ground; but though they lifted her up, there were no  signs of breath from her mouth, and they found she was really dead. Yet  they tried in every way to restore her; they tried to extract the poison  from her lips, they combed her hair, and washed it with wine and water,  but all to no purpose: the dear child gave no signs of life, and at last  they knew she was dead. Then they laid her on a bier, and the seven  dwarfs seated themselves round her, and wept and mourned for three days.  They would have buried her then, but there was no change in her  appearance; her face was as fresh, and her cheeks and lips had their  usual colour. Then said one, \"We cannot lay this beautiful child in the  dark, cold earth.\"    So they agreed to have a coffin made entirely of glass, transparent all  over, that they might watch for any signs of decay, and they wrote in  letters of gold her name on the lid, and that she was the daughter of a  king. The coffin was placed on the side of the mountain, and each of  them watched it by turns, so that it was never left alone. And the birds  of the air came near and mourned for Snow-white; first the owl, then the  raven, and at last the dove. Snow-white lay for a long, long time in the  glass coffin, but showed not the least signs of decay. It seemed as if  she slept; for her skin was snow white, her cheeks rosy red, and her  hair black as ebony.    It happened one day that the son of a king, while riding in the forest,  came by chance upon the dwarfs' house and asked for a night's lodging.  As he left the next morning he saw the coffin on the mountain-side, with  beautiful Snow-white lying in it, and read what was written upon the lid  in letters of gold.    Then he said to the dwarfs, \"Let me have this coffin, and I will give  you for it whatever you ask.\"    But the elder dwarf answered, \"We would not give it thee for all the  gold in the world.\"    But the prince answered, \"Let me have it as a gift, then. I know not  why, but my heart is drawn towards this beautiful child, and I feel I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1493"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 1 (#5)"],[1," hail. The width of each is one thousand ells, its depth one  thousand, and its length three hundred, and they flow one from  the other, and are supervised by ninety thousand Angels of  Destruction. There are, besides, in every compartment seven  thousand caves, in every cave there are seven thousand crevices,  and in every crevice seven thousand scorpions. Every scorpion has  three hundred rings, and in every ring seven thousand pouches of  venom, from which flow seven rivers of deadly poison. If a man  handles it, he immediately bursts, every limb is torn from his  body, his bowels are cleft asunder, and he falls upon his  face.[56] There are also five different kinds of fire in hell.  One devours and absorbs, another devours and does not absorb,  while the third absorbs and does not devour, and there is still  another fire, which neither devours nor absorbs, and furthermore  a fire which devours fire. There are coals big as mountains, and  coals big as hills, and coals as large as the Dead Sea, and coals  like huge stones, and there are rivers of pitch and sulphur  flowing and seething like live coals.[60]    The third creation of the second day was the angel hosts, both  the ministering angels and the angels of praise. The reason they  had not been called into being on the first day was, lest men  believe that the angels assisted God in the creation of the  heavens and the earth.[61] The angels that are fashioned from  fire have forms of fire,[62] but only so long as they remain in  heaven. When they descend to earth, to do the bidding of God here  below, either they are changed into wind, or they assume the  guise of men.[63] There are ten ranks or degrees among the  angels.[64]    The most exalted in rank are those surrounding the Divine Throne  on all sides, to the right, to the left, in front, and behind,  under the leadership of the archangels Michael, Gabriel, Uriel,  and Raphael.[65]    All the celestial beings praise God with the words, \"Holy, holy,  holy, is the Lord of hosts,\" but men take precedence of the  angels herein. They may not begin their song of praise until the  earthly beings have brought their homage to God.[66] Especially  Israel is preferred to the angels. When they encircle the Divine  Throne in the form of fiery mountains and flaming hills, and  attempt to raise their voices in adoration of the Creator, God  silences them with the words, \"Keep quiet until I have heard the  songs, praises, prayers, and sweet melodies of Israel.\"  Accordingly, the ministering angels and all the other celestial  hosts wait until the last tones of Israel's doxologies rising  aloft from earth have died away, and then they proclaim in a loud  voice, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts.\" When the hour  for the glorification of God by the angels draws nigh, the august  Divine herald, the angel Sham'iel, steps to the windows[67] of  the lowest heaven to hearken to the songs, prayers, and praises  that ascend from the synagogues and the houses of learning, and  when they are finished, he announces the end to the angels in all  the heavens. The ministering angels, those who come in contact  with the sublunary world,[68] now repair to their chambers to  take their purification bath. They dive into a stream of fire and  flame seven times, and three hundred and sixty-five times they  examine themselves carefully, to make sure that no taint clings  to their bodies.[69] Only then they feel privileged to mount the  fiery ladder and join the angels of the seventh heaven, and  surround the throne of God with Hashmal and all the holy Hayyot.  Adorned with millions of fiery crowns, arrayed in fiery garments,  all the angels in unison, in the same words, and with the same  melody, intone songs of praise to God.[70]      THE THIRD DAY    Up to this time the earth was a plain, and wholly covered with  water. Scarcely had the words of God, \"Let the waters be gathered  together,\" made themselves heard, when mountains appeared all  over and hills,[71] and the water collected in the deep-lying  basins. But the water was recalcitrant, it resisted the order to  occupy the lowly spots, and threatened to overflow the earth,  until God forced it back into the sea, and encircled the sea with  sand. Now, whenever the water is tempted to transgress its  bounds, it beholds the sand, and recoils.[72]    The waters did but imitate their chief Rahab, the Angel of the  Sea, who rebelled at the creation of the world. God had commanded  Rahab to take in the water. But he refused, saying, \"I have  enough.\" The punishment for his disobedience was death. His body  rests in the depths of the sea, the water dispelling the foul  odor that emanates from it.[73]    The main creation of the third day was the realm of plants, the  terrestrial plants as well as the plants of Paradise. First of  all the cedars of Lebanon and the other great trees were made. In  their pride at having been put first, they shot up high in the  air. They considered themselves the favored among plants. Then  God spake, \"I hate arrogance and pride, for I alone am exalted,  and none beside,\" and He created the iron on the same day, the  substance with which trees are felled down. The trees began to  weep, and when God asked the reason of their tears, they said:  \"We cry because Thou hast created the iron to uproot us  therewith. All the while we had thought ourselves the highest of  the earth, and now the iron, our destroyer, has been called into  existence.\" God replied: \"You yourselves will furnish the axe  with a handle. Without your assistance the iron will not be able  to do aught against you.\"[74]    The command to bear seed after their kind was given to the trees  alone. But the various sorts of grass reasoned, that if God had  not desired divisions according to classes, He would not have  instructed the trees to bear fruit after their kind with the seed  thereof in it, especially as trees are inclined of their own  accord to divide themselves into species. The grasses therefore  reproduced themselves also after their kinds. This prompted the  exclamation of the Prince of the World, \"Let the glory of the  Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works.\"[75]    The most important work done on the third day was the creation of  Paradise. Two gates of carbuncle form the entrance to  Paradise,[76] and sixty myriads of ministering angels keep watch  over them. Each of these angels shines with the lustre of the  heavens. When the just man appears before the gates, the clothes  in which he was buried are taken off him, and the angels array  him in seven garments of clouds of glory, and place upon his head  two crowns, one of precious stones and pearls, the other of gold  of Parvaim,[77] and they put eight myrtles in his hand, and they  utter praises before him and say to him, \"Go thy way, and eat thy  bread with joy.\" And they lead him to a place full of rivers,  surrounded by eight hundred kinds of roses and myrtles. Each one  has a canopy according to his merits,[78] and under it flow four  rivers, one of milk, the other of balsam, the third of wine, and  the fourth of honey. Every canopy is overgrown by a vine of gold,  and thirty pearls hang from it, each of them shining like Venus.  Under each canopy there is a table of precious stones and pearls,  and sixty angels stand at the head of every just man, saying unto  him: \"Go and eat with joy of the honey, for thou hast busied  thyself with the Torah, and she is sweeter than honey, and drink  of the wine preserved in the grape since the six days of  creation,[79] for thou hast busied thyself with the Torah, and  she is compared to wine.\" The least fair of the just is beautiful  as Joseph and Rabbi Johanan, and as the grains of a silver  pomegranate upon which fall the rays of the sun.[80] There is no  light, \"for the light of the righteous is the shining light.\" And  they undergo four transformations every day, passing through four  states. In the first the righteous is changed into a child. He  enters the division for children, and tastes the joys of  childhood. Then he is changed into a youth, and enters the  division for the youths, with whom he enjoys the delights of  youth. Next he becomes an adult, in the prime of life, and he  enters the division of men, and enjoys the pleasures of manhood.  Finally, he is changed into an old man. He enters the division  for the old, and enjoys the pleasures of age.    There are eighty myriads of trees in every corner of Paradise,  the meanest among them choicer than all the spice trees. In every  corner there are sixty myriads of angels singing with sweet  voices, and the tree of life stands in the middle and shades the  whole of Paradise.[81] It has fifteen thousand tastes, each  different from the other, and the perfumes thereof vary likewise.  Over it hang seven clouds of glory, and winds blow upon it from  all four sides,[82] so that its odor is wafted from one end of  the world to the other. Underneath sit the scholars and explain  the Torah. Over each of them two canopies are spread, one of  stars, the other of sun and moon, and a curtain of clouds of  glory separates the one canopy from the other.[83] Beyond  Paradise begins Eden, containing three hundred and ten worlds[84]  and seven compartments for seven different classes of the pious.  In the first are \"the martyr victims of the government,\" like  Rabbi Akiba and his colleagues;[85] in the second those who were  drowned;[86] in the third[87] Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his  disciples; in the fourth those who were carried off in the cloud  of glory;[88] in the fifth the penitents, who occupy a place  which even a perfectly pious man cannot obtain; in the sixth are  the youths[89] who have not tasted of sin in their lives; in the  seventh are those poor who studied Bible and Mishnah, and led a  life of self-respecting decency. And God sits in the midst of  them and expounds the Torah to them.[90]    As for"]]]
