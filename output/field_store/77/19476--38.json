[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#5)"],[1,"in Wealth?    Objection 1: It would seem that man's happiness consists in wealth.  For since happiness is man's last end, it must consist in that which  has the greatest hold on man's affections. Now this is wealth: for it  is written (Eccles. 10:19): \"All things obey money.\" Therefore man's  happiness consists in wealth.    Obj. 2: Further, according to Boethius (De Consol. iii), happiness is  \"a state of life made perfect by the aggregate of all good things.\"  Now money seems to be the means of possessing all things: for, as the  Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 5), money was invented, that it might be  a sort of guarantee for the acquisition of whatever man desires.  Therefore happiness consists in wealth.    Obj. 3: Further, since the desire for the sovereign good never fails,  it seems to be infinite. But this is the case with riches more than  anything else; since \"a covetous man shall not be satisfied with  riches\" (Eccles. 5:9). Therefore happiness consists in wealth.    _On the contrary,_ Man's good consists in retaining happiness rather  than in spreading it. But as Boethius says (De Consol. ii), \"wealth  shines in giving rather than in hoarding: for the miser is hateful,  whereas the generous man is applauded.\" Therefore man's happiness  does not consist in wealth.    _I answer that,_ It is impossible for man's happiness to consist in  wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3),  viz. natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man  as a remedy for his natural wants: such as food, drink, clothing,  cars, dwellings, and such like, while artificial wealth is that which  is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art  of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things  salable.    Now it is evident that man's happiness cannot consist in natural  wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something  else, viz. as a support of human nature: consequently it cannot be  man's last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore  in the order of nature, all such things are below man, and made for  him, according to Ps. 8:8: \"Thou hast subjected all things under his  feet.\"    And as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of  natural wealth; since man would not seek it except because, by its  means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently  much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore  it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to  consist in wealth.    Reply Obj. 1: All material things obey money, so far as the  multitude of fools is concerned, who know no other than material  goods, which can be obtained for money. But we should take our  estimation of human goods not from the foolish but from the wise: just  as it is for a person whose sense of taste is in good order, to judge  whether a thing is palatable.    Reply Obj. 2: All things salable can be had for money: not so  spiritual things, which cannot be sold. Hence it is written (Prov.  17:16): \"What doth it avail a fool to have riches, seeing he cannot  buy wisdom.\"    Reply Obj. 3: The desire for natural riches is not infinite:  because they suffice for nature in a certain measure. But the desire  for artificial wealth is infinite, for it is the servant of disordered  concupiscence, which is not curbed, as the Philosopher makes clear  (Polit. i, 3). Yet this desire for wealth is infinite otherwise than  the desire for the sovereign good. For the more perfectly the  sovereign good is possessed, the more it is loved, and other things  despised: because the more we possess it, the more we know it. Hence  it is written (Ecclus. 24:29): \"They that eat me shall yet hunger.\"  Whereas in the desire for wealth and for whatsoever temporal goods,  the contrary is the case: for when we already possess them, we despise  them, and seek others: which is the sense of Our Lord's words (John  4:13): \"Whosoever drinketh of this water,\" by which temporal goods are  signified, \"shall thirst again.\" The reason of this is that we realize  more their insufficiency when we possess them: and this very fact  shows that they are imperfect, and the sovereign good does not consist  therein.  ________________________    SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 2, Art. 2]    Whether Man's Happiness Consists in Honors?    Objection 1: It would seem that man's happiness consists in honors.  For happiness or bliss is \"the reward of virtue,\" as the Philosopher  says (Ethic. i, 9). But honor more than anything else seems to be that  by which virtue is rewarded, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3).  Therefore happiness consists especially in honor.    Obj. 2: Further, that which belongs to God and to persons of great  excellence seems especially to be happiness, which is the perfect  good. But that is honor, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3).  Moreover, the Apostle says (1 Tim. 1:17): \"To . . . the only God be  honor and glory.\" Therefore happiness consists in honor.    Obj. 3: Further, that which man desires above all is happiness. But  nothing seems more desirable to man than honor: since man suffers  loss in all other things, lest he should suffer loss of honor.  Therefore happiness consists in honor.    _On the contrary,_ Happiness is in the happy. But honor is not in the  honored, but rather in him who honors, and who offers deference to  the person honored, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 5). Therefore  happiness does not consist in honor.    _I answer that,_ It is impossible for happiness to consist in honor.  For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and  consequently it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is  in the person honored. Now a man's excellence is in proportion,  especially to his happiness, which is man's perfect good; and to its  parts, i.e. those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness.  And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot  principally consist therein.    Reply Obj. 1: As the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 5), honor is not  that reward of virtue, for which the virtuous work: but they receive  honor from men by way of reward, \"as from those who have nothing  greater to offer.\" But virtue's true reward is happiness itself, for  which the virtuous work: whereas if they worked for honor, it would  no longer be a virtue, but ambition.    Reply Obj. 2: Honor is due to God and to persons of great excellence  as a sign of attestation of excellence already existing: not that  honor makes them excellent.    Reply Obj. 3: That man desires honor above all else, arises from his  natural desire for happiness, from which honor results, as stated  above. Wherefore man seeks to be honored especially by the wise, on  whose judgment he believes himself to be excellent or happy.  ________________________    THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 2, Art. 3]    Whether Man's Happiness Consists in Fame or Glory?    Objection 1: It would seem that man's happiness consists in glory.  For happiness seems to consist in that which is paid to the saints  for the trials they have undergone in the world. But this is glory:  for the Apostle says (Rom. 8:18): \"The sufferings of this time are  not worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be  revealed in us.\" Therefore happiness consists in glory.    Obj. 2: Further, good is diffusive of itself, as stated by Dionysius  (Div. Nom. iv). But man's good is spread abroad in the knowledge of  others by glory more than by anything else: since, according to  Ambrose [*Augustine, Contra Maxim. Arian. ii. 13], glory consists \"in  being well known and praised.\" Therefore man's happiness consists in  glory.    Obj. 3: Further, happiness is the most enduring good. Now this seems  to be fame or glory; because by this men attain to eternity after a  fashion. Hence Boethius says (De Consol. ii): \"You seem to beget unto  yourselves eternity, when you think of your fame in future time.\"  Therefore man's happiness consists in fame or glory.    _On the contrary,_ Happiness is man's true good. But it happens that  fame or glory is false: for as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), \"many  owe their renown to the lying reports spread among the people. Can  anything be more shameful? For those who receive false fame, must  needs blush at their own praise.\" Therefore man's happiness does not  consist in fame or glory.    _I answer that,_ Man's happiness cannot consist in human fame or  glory. For glory consists \"in being well known and praised,\" as  Ambrose [*Augustine, Contra Maxim. Arian. ii, 13] says. Now the thing  known is related to human knowledge otherwise than to God's  knowledge: for human knowledge is caused by the things known, whereas  God's knowledge is the cause of the things known. Wherefore the  perfection of human good, which is called happiness, cannot be caused  by human knowledge: but rather human knowledge of another's happiness  proceeds from, and, in a fashion, is caused by, human happiness  itself, inchoate or perfect. Consequently man's happiness cannot  consist in fame or glory. On the other hand, man's good depends on  God's knowledge as its cause. And therefore man's beatitude depends,  as on its cause, on the glory which man has with God; according to  Ps. 90:15, 16: \"I will deliver him, and I will glorify him; I will  fill him with length of days, and I will show him my salvation.\"    Furthermore, we must observe that human knowledge often fails,  especially in contingent singulars, such as are human acts. For this  reason human glory is frequently deceptive. But since God cannot be  deceived, His glory is always true; hence it is written (2 Cor.  10:18): \"He . . . is approved . . . whom God commendeth.\"    Reply Obj. 1: The Apostle speaks, then, not of the glory which is  with men, but of the glory which is from God, with His Angels. Hence  it is written (Mk. 8:38): \"The Son of Man shall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17910"],[0,"The Mafulu: Mountain People of British New Guinea (#5)"],[1,"made out of tails of lizards covered by  narrow straps of palm leaves dyed yellow\" (which, though not correctly  descriptive of the Mafulu earring, is apparently something like it),  to their use of pigs' tails as ear ornaments, to their plaiting of the  hair and the decoration of the plaited hair with teeth and shells, to  their small charm bags and to the shortness of their bows. Also to the  construction of their houses, with the roof carried down to the ground,  with a fireplace about 2 feet wide extending down the centre of the  building from one end to the other, and having an inclined floor on  each side, and especially to the curious apse-like roof projections  in front of these houses (Dr. Haddon calls them \"pent roofs\" [17]),  Sir William's figure of which is, like that of the Chirima villages,  identical, or nearly so, with that of a Mafulu house. But Sir William's  description of the physique of these Mt. Scratchley people and other  matters make it clear, I think, that they belong to a type different  from that of the Mafulu, though they must be next door neighbours of  the Fuyuge-speaking people. Dr. Seligmann, in commenting upon this  description of these people, expresses the opinion that they are  Papuo-Melanesians. [18]    The natives in the region of Mt. Musgrave and Mt. Knutsford, as  described by Mr. Thomson, [19] appear, at all events so far as dress  is concerned, to be utterly different from the Mafulu.    Dr. Seligmann states that Dr. Strong has informed him that the  southern boundary of the Fuyuge-speaking area is the Kabadi country,  [20] and he had previously referred to Korona, immediately behind  the Kabadi and Doura districts, as being within the area, [21] and,  indeed, the Geographical Society's map shows the Fuyuge area as  at all events extending as far south as Korona. I do not know how  far inland the Kabadi and Doura people extend; but I may say that  the Mafulu Fathers expressed grave doubt as to the extension of the  Fuyuge area so far south as is indicated by the map.    If the Fuyuge area does in fact reach the Kabadi boundary, and if my  notes on the Mafulu people are, as suggested, broadly descriptive of  the natives of the whole Fuyuge area, there must be a very sudden  and sharp differentiation, as the Kabadi people are apparently an  offshoot from Mekeo, [22] with apparently other Papuo-Melanesian blood  (especially Roro) introduced. [23]    The contour and appearance of the country in the actual Mafulu district  of the Fuyuge area is strikingly different from that of the immediately  adjoining Kuni country, the sharp steep ridges and narrow deep-cut  valleys of the latter, with their thick unbroken covering of almost  impenetrable forest, changing to higher mountain ranges with lateral  ridges among them, and with frequent gentle undulating slopes and  wider and more open valleys; while, interspersed with the forests,  are small patches and great stretches of grass land, sometimes thinly  covered or scattered with timber and sometimes quite open and devoid  of trees. [24] And this condition continues, I was told, over the  greater part of the triangular area above referred to.    Plates 1 and 2 give, I think, a fair illustration of what I mean,  the steep contours and thickly wooded character of the foreground and  nearer middle distance shown by Plate 1 being typical Kuni scenery,  and the more open nature of the country displayed by Plate 2 and the  comparative freedom from forest of its foreground being typical of  the higher uplands of Mafulu. [25]    It will be noticed that the physical character of the Mafulu country  is more favourable to continued occupation than is that of the Kuni  country; and it is a fact that the Mafulu people are not so restless  and ready to move as are the Kuni folk; and, even when they do migrate,  it is generally to a spot comparatively near to their old villages.    The geological formation of the lower hills on which the actual Mafulu  villages are placed and the intervening valleys is partly limestone;  and I was told that limestone formation was also found further to  the east.    Throughout this book I shall use the term \"Mafulu\" as including,  not only the little group of villages near the north-westerly corner  of the Fuyuge linguistic area actually known by that name, but also  the other groups of Fuyuge villages in the north-western portion of  that area; and, as above indicated, it is believed by the Fathers of  the Mission that I should be substantially correct if I included the  whole of the northern and north-eastern, and probably the southern  portions of the known part of that area, and possibly the entire area.              CHAPTER II    Physique and Character      Physique.    The Mafulu people are of short stature, though perhaps a trifle taller  than the Kuni.    They are as a rule fairly strong and muscular in build, the women  in particular having very strongly developed thighs; but, speaking  generally, their limbs are more slender, and their general development  is slighter, than is usually the case among the Roro and Mekeo people.    They appear to be usually mesaticephalic, but to have a very marked  tendency to brachycephaly.    Their noses seemed to me to be generally strong, and of prominent  size, varying considerably in width of bridge, but usually having  rather widely distending nostrils; and sometimes the width of the  nose was equal to its length, or nearly so.    Referring to the above matters, the following are the results of  twenty measurements of Mafulu men. These were obtained from men of  upwards of six different communities or groups of villages, so as to  avoid the possible misleading character of measurements made in only  one village or group of villages, in which some family relationship  between the persons measured might militate against the true average  character of the figures obtained.

Lowest number.  Average.        Stature [26]    163 cm.         147 cm.         155.1 cm.                      (64.2 ins.)     (57.9 ins.)     (61.1 ins.)

Number of cranial indices between 75 and 80 = 10 (50 per cent.).      Number of cranial indices over 80 = 6 (30 per cent.).      There are a few points in connection with these figures to which I  would draw attention. The very short man (No. 20--height, 147 cm.) has  a cranial index of 75.1, on the border line between dolichocephaly  and mesaticephaly. He has also a short nose (4.6 cm.), and is one  of the two with the narrowest noses (3.8 c.m.). The very tall man  (No. 8--height, 163 cm.) has a long head (19.4 cm.), and the lowest  dolichocephalic cranial index of 72.7, and is one of two with the  longest noses (5.6 cm.). The other very tall man (No. 10--height,  163 cm.) has one of the two shortest heads (17.4 cm.), and the highest  brachycephalic cranial index of 84.8, and has a long nose (5.5 cm.) The  man (No. 2) whose nasal index is 100 has the mesaticephalic cranial  index of 78.3 (almost the average index). The other man (No. 4)  whose nasal index is 100 has a head of exactly the average length  (18.5 cm.) and the greatest breadth (15.4 cm.), and the brachycephalic  cranial index of 81.2. The man (No. 17) with the lowest nasal index  of 71.4 has a very short head (17.7 cm.), and the brachycephalic  cranial index of 82.2.    The following tables, however, illustrate the fact that the  measurements of these twenty men do not appear to indicate, as  regards them, any marked connection between stature, cranial index,  and nasal index.
