Clark, by whose    permission the accompanying plan, reproduced from the _Memorials    of Old Suffolk_, was made.      [3] _Memorials of Old Suffolk_, edited by V.B. Redstone, p. 226.    It is pathetic to think of the historic churches, beautiful villages,  and smiling pastures that have been swept away by the relentless sea.  There are no less than twelve towns and villages in Yorkshire that  have been thus buried, and five in Suffolk. Ravensburgh, in the former  county, was once a flourishing seaport. Here landed Henry IV in 1399,  and Edward IV in 1471. It returned two members to Parliament. An old  picture of the place shows the church, a large cross, and houses; but  it has vanished with the neighbouring villages of Redmare,  Tharlethorp, Frismarch, and Potterfleet, and \"left not a wrack  behind.\" Leland mentions it in 1538, after which time its place in  history and on the map knows it no more. The ancient church of Kilnsea  lost half its fabric in 1826, and the rest followed in 1831. Alborough  Church and the Castle of Grimston have entirely vanished. Mapleton  Church was formerly two miles from the sea; it is now on a cliff with  the sea at its feet, awaiting the final attack of the all-devouring  enemy. Nearly a century ago Owthorne Church and churchyard were  overwhelmed, and the shore was strewn with ruins and shattered  coffins. On the Tyneside the destruction has been remarkable and  rapid. In the district of Saltworks there was a house built standing  on the cliff, but it was never finished, and fell a prey to the waves.  At Percy Square an inn and two cottages have been destroyed. The edge  of the cliff in 1827 was eighty feet seaward, and the banks of Percy  Square receded a hundred and eighty feet between the years 1827 and  1892. Altogether four acres have disappeared. An old Roman building,  locally known as \"Gingling Geordie's Hole,\" and large masses of the  Castle Cliff fell into the sea in the 'eighties. The remains of the  once flourishing town of Seaton, on the Durham coast, can be  discovered amid the sands at low tide. The modern village has sunk  inland, and cannot now boast of an ancient chapel dedicated to St.  Thomas of Canterbury, which has been devoured by the waves.    Skegness, on the Lincolnshire coast, was a large and important town;  it boasted of a castle with strong fortifications and a church with a  lofty spire; it now lies deep beneath the devouring sea, which no  guarding walls could conquer. Far out at sea, beneath the waves, lies  old Cromer Church, and when storms rage its bells are said to chime.  The churchyard wherein was written the pathetic ballad \"The Garden of  Sleep\" is gradually disappearing, and \"the graves of the fair women  that sleep by the cliffs by the sea\" have been outraged, and their  bodies scattered and devoured by the pitiless waves.    One of the greatest prizes of the sea is the ancient city of Dunwich,  which dates back to the Roman era. The Domesday Survey shows that it  was then a considerable town having 236 burgesses. It was girt with  strong walls; it possessed an episcopal palace, the seat of the East  Anglian bishopric; it had (so Stow asserts) fifty-two churches, a  monastery, brazen gates, a town hall, hospitals, and the dignity of  possessing a mint. Stow tells of its departed glories, its royal and  episcopal palaces, the sumptuous mansion of the mayor, its numerous  churches and its windmills, its harbour crowded with shipping, which  sent forth forty vessels for the king's service in the thirteenth  century. Though Dunwich was an important place, Stow's description of  it is rather exaggerated. It could never have had more than ten  churches and monasteries. Its \"brazen gates\" are mythical, though it  had its Lepers' Gate, South Gate, and others. It was once a thriving  city of wealthy merchants and industrious fishermen. King John granted  to it a charter. It suffered from the attacks of armed men as well as  from the ravages of the sea. Earl Bigot and the revolting barons  besieged it in the reign of Edward I. Its decay was gradual. In 1342,  in the parish of St. Nicholas, out of three hundred houses only  eighteen remained. Only seven out of a hundred houses were standing in  the parish of St. Martin. St. Peter's parish was devastated and  depopulated. It had a small round church, like that at Cambridge,  called the Temple, once the property of the Knights Templars, richly  endowed with costly gifts. This was a place of sanctuary, as were the  other churches in the city. With the destruction of the houses came  also the decay of the port which no ships could enter. Its rival,  Southwold, attracted the vessels of strangers. The markets and fairs  were deserted. Silence and ruin reigned over the doomed town, and the  ruined church of All Saints is all that remains of its former glories,  save what the storms sometimes toss along the beach for the study and  edification of antiquaries.    As we proceed down the coast we find that the sea is still gaining on  the land. The old church at Walton-on-the-Naze was swept away, and is  replaced by a new one. A flourishing town existed at Reculver, which  dates back to the Romans. It was a prosperous place, and had a noble  church, which in the sixteenth century was a mile from the sea.  Steadily have the waves advanced, until a century ago the church fell  into the sea, save two towers which have been preserved by means of  elaborate sea-walls as a landmark for sailors.    The fickle sea has deserted some towns and destroyed their prosperity;  it has receded all along the coast from Folkestone to the Sussex  border, and left some of the famous Cinque Ports, some of which we  shall visit again, Lymne, Romney, Hythe, Richborough, Stonor,  Sandwich, and Sarre high and dry, with little or no access to the sea.  Winchelsea has had a strange career. The old town lies beneath the  waves, but a new Winchelsea arose, once a flourishing port, but now  deserted and forlorn with the sea a mile away. Rye, too, has been  forsaken. It was once an island; now the little Rother stream conveys  small vessels to the sea, which looks very far away.    We cannot follow all the victories of the sea. We might examine the  inroads made by the waves at Selsea. There stood the first cathedral  of the district before Chichester was founded. The building is now  beneath the sea, and since Saxon times half of the Selsea Bill has  vanished. The village of Selsea rested securely in the centre of the  peninsula, but only half a mile now separates it from the sea. Some  land has been gained near this projecting headland by an industrious  farmer. His farm surrounded a large cove with a narrow mouth through  which the sea poured. If he could only dam up that entrance, he  thought he could rescue the bed of the cove and add to his acres. He  bought an old ship and sank it by the entrance and proceeded to drain.  But a tiresome storm arose and drove the ship right across the cove,  and the sea poured in again. By no means discouraged, he dammed up the  entrance more effectually, got rid of the water, increased his farm by  many acres, and the old ship makes an admirable cow-shed.    [Illustration: Disused Mooring-Post on bank of the Rother, Rye]    The Isle of Wight in remote geological periods was part of the  mainland. The Scilly Isles were once joined with Cornwall, and were  not severed until the fourteenth century, when by a mighty storm and  flood, 140 churches and villages were destroyed and overwhelmed, and  190 square miles of land carried away. Much land has been lost in the  Wirral district of Cheshire. Great forests have been overwhelmed, as  the skulls and bones of deer and horse and fresh-water shell-fish have  been frequently discovered at low tide. Fifty years ago a distance of  half a mile separated Leasowes Castle from the sea; now its walls are  washed by the waves. The Pennystone, off the Lancashire coast by  Blackpool, tells of a submerged village and manor, about which cluster  romantic legends.    Such is the sad record of the sea's destruction, for which the  industrious reclamation of land, the compensations wrought by the  accumulation of shingle and sand dunes and the silting of estuaries  can scarcely compensate us. How does the sea work this? There are  certain rock-boring animals, such as the Pholas, which help to decay  the rocks. Each mollusc cuts a series of augur-holes from two to four  inches deep, and so assists in destroying the bulwarks of England.  Atmospheric action, the disintegration of soft rocks by frost and by  the attack of the sea below, all tend in the same direction. But the  foolish action of man in removing shingle, the natural protection of  our coasts, is also very mischievous. There is an instance of this in  the Hall Sands and Bee Sands, Devon. A company a few years ago  obtained authority to dredge both from the foreshore and sea-bed. The  Commissioners of Woods and Forests and the Board of Trade granted this  permission, the latter receiving a royalty of L50 and the former L150.  This occurred in 1896. Soon afterwards a heavy gale arose and caused  an immense amount of damage, the result entirely of this dredging. The  company had to pay heavily, and the royalties were returned to them.  This is only one instance out of many which might be quoted. We are an  illogical nation, and our regulations and authorities are weirdly  confused. It appears that the foreshore is under the control of the  Board of Trade, and then a narrow strip of land is ruled over by the  Commissioners of Woods and Forests. Of course these bodies do not  agree; different policies are pursued by each, and the coast suffers.  Large sums are sometimes spent in coast-defence works. At Spurn no  less than L37,433 has been spent out of Parliamentary grants, besides  L14,227 out of the Mercantile Marine Fund. Corporations or county  authorities,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14760"],[0,"Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (#5)"],[1,", the doctor commented that she must  have prepared the wrong lecture--it should have been for an older group.  A transcript of the questions was produced to the Committee. They were  inquiries which one would assume might be made by young women who had  married or were about to marry. Whether these young girls were sincere  in their questioning of the doctor, whether they wanted to exhibit  advanced knowledge, or whether they were endeavouring to create a  sensation, the fact remains that they had in mind aspects of sex which  were well in advance of their years.    This change in the mental attitude of offending children was further  exemplified by evidence that, in one series of cases in Auckland,  records were kept, and there was some competition between girls  concerning the number of immoral acts in which they were involved. The  Committee were shocked to hear from the police that one girl claimed a  total of 148 instances in her favour.      =(6) Homosexuality=    The Committee has read reports from Great Britain of an increase in  homosexual practices there. Recent New Zealand happenings might be taken  to indicate a similar increase in this country. The Committee has made  no investigation of these matters, but considers it wise to remind  parents that sexual misbehaviour can occur between members of the same  sex.    The conclusion of the Committee is that the above pattern of immorality  is of a kind which was not previously manifest in New Zealand. It cannot  be dealt with on the footing that it has always been with us. The  attitude of mind shown by those who have planned and organized sexual  parties, and sometimes caught others within their net, is something  which demands serious consideration. The subject cannot be dismissed in  the light, airy way of those people who, without any adequate knowledge  of the facts, have been saying that there is nothing new about the  sexual misbehaviour of young people and that nothing can be done to  improve matters. The situation is a serious one, and something must be  done.          _VI. Searching for the Cause_    Many have been the views expressed as to the reasons for this immorality  and the suggested remedies. After considering the evidence, after  reading much literature on the subject, and weighing up all the  suggested factors, the view of the Committee is that the matter is not  capable of simplification by regarding any, or even all, the causes  suggested and discussed below as being the main cause. In seeking to  remedy the evil it must steadily be borne in mind that we have not only  to deal with the immediately apparent causes. Letters to the press,  letters to this Committee, and many of the submissions made reveal a  failure to dig below the surface or to look beyond the factors which  came immediately to the mind of the writers or those which, from  personal experience, appeared to them to be the decisive or motivating  factors.    The way in which the Committee approached a consideration of this  problem was to distinguish between those causes which appeared to be the  precipitating causes and those which it regarded as predisposing causes.  The precipitating causes are those which are closely related in time or  circumstance to the actual misbehaviour. The predisposing causes are  those which create an emotional maladjustment in a person and thus  induce a susceptibility to the precipitating cause. For instance, a  semi-nude figure or a song with a double meaning will not incite a  properly instructed adolescent to sexual misconduct. But if by parental  neglect or failure to control a young person is predisposed to  anti-social conduct, there is danger in any form of suggestiveness.    The Committee has carefully considered many suggested causes (whether  precipitating or predisposing) and now sets out its views on those which  merit special mention.    If, as the Committee believes, immoral behaviour should be regarded as a  phase or facet of juvenile delinquency, the same influences which tend  to incite other anti-social behaviour are in operation here.    Much has been written in textbooks, in journals, and in various  scattered articles about the causes of juvenile delinquency. What  applies in other communities, and in other aspects of juvenile  delinquency, must apply with much the same force in this Dominion as  elsewhere, and to the sexual deviant as to all other juvenile  delinquents. In searching for the real or substantive cause it must be  borne in mind that juvenile delinquency, of the type now being  considered, is a new feature of modern life and a facet of juvenile  delinquency which does not appear to have engaged the attention of  research workers.    The state of affairs which has come about was uncertain in origin,  insidious in growth, and has developed over a wide field. In searching  for the cause, and in suggesting the remedies which may be applied, the  Committee must not be thought to be laying the blame on any one section  of the community more than another.          _VII. Some Visual and Auditory Influences_      =(1) Objectionable Publications=    There has been a great wave of public indignation against some  paper-backed or \"pulp\" printed matter. Crime stories, tales of \"intimate  exciting romance\", and so-called \"comics\" have all been blamed for  exciting erotic feelings in children. The suggestiveness in the cover  pictures of glamour girls dressed in a thin veiling often attracts more  attention than the pages inside.    Immorality would probably not result from the distribution of these  publications, unless there were in the child, awaiting expression, an  unhealthy degree of sexual emotionalism. Some of these publications are,  possibly, more harmful to girls than to boys in that girls more readily  identify themselves with the chief characters. One striking piece of  information which was conveyed to the Committee was that the girls under  detention in a certain institution (the greater number of them had had a  good deal of sexual experience) decided that various publications were  more harmful than films because the images conveyed by the printed  matter were personal to them and more lasting.    The Committee has been deluged with periodicals, paper-backed books, and  \"comics\" considered by their respective senders to be so harmful to  children and adolescents that their sale should not be permitted. But,  while all the publications sent are objectionable in varying degrees,  they cannot be rejected under the law as it at present stands because  that law relates only to things which are indecent or obscene.    An Inter-departmental Committee set up in 1952 to report on worthless  and indecent literature similarly found that, while publications  intended for adults are controlled by the Indecent Publications Act  (which in the opinion of that Committee, was adequate providing the  public initiated action under it), comics and other publications outside  the scope of that Act might be objectionable for children.    When considering comics it is essential to appreciate the difference  between the traditional comic, intended exclusively for children, and  the more modern style which is basically designed for low-mentality  adults. Both styles and variations of them circulate widely in New  Zealand among children and adolescents. In general, however, younger  children buy, and even prefer, the genuine comic which is not harmful  and may even be helpful. Adolescents, and adults also, are attracted by  comic books that have been denounced by various authorities as  anti-educational, and even pernicious, in moral outlook.    The Inter-departmental Committee recommended that all comics be  registered and that it be made an offence to deal in unregistered  comics. There are strong doubts whether the adoption of those proposals  would provide a satisfactory solution. Once registration were obtained  (which would be almost automatic on application) much damage might be  done by the distribution of a particular issue before registration could  be cancelled.    Surely a simpler, faster, and safer procedure would be to make initial  registration more difficult and subsequent deregistration more speedy.    Amendments recently made to the laws of various Australian States should  result in a general improvement in the standard of publications  distributed in Australia, and consequently in New Zealand. On the other  hand, this tightening of the law may induce distributors to dump in New  Zealand publications for which they have no longer a market in  Australia.    A banning, rather than a censorship, of printed matter injurious to  children should be the subject of immediate legislation for three  reasons:      (_a_) To prevent the Dominion being used as a market to offset any    trade lost in some Australian States;      (_b_) To encourage the efforts of those people who seek to lead    children through good reading to better things; and      (_c_) To let publishers know that the time has passed when    publications likely to be injurious to the minds of children and    adolescents may be distributed by them with impunity.    In order to meet the situation, it would be desirable for the Government  to promote special legislation along the lines of the Victorian Police  Offences (Obscene Publications) Act 1954.    The Victorian legislation is particularly effective since not only does  it widen the definition of \"indecent\" and \"obscene\", and enables the  police themselves to institute proceedings for breaches of the Act, but  it also compels all distributors to be registered. Then, should a  distributor be convicted of an offence, he may be deregistered, and in  that case would be unable to distribute any other publication whatever.    Despite frequent reference to distributors dumping objectionable  publications on a newsagent or bookseller, who has to accept the bad  before he can get the good, the Committee"]]]
