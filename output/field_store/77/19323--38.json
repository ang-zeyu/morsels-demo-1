I would suggest that the Commission of Conservation make a       close investigation of the _ways and means_ of the fur       traders along the north shore, and I believe that official,       unbiassed and independent investigation will expose a very       peculiar state of affairs in connection with the       mal-conservation of game.    Mr. Clive Phillips-Wolley, the well known authority on big-game sport,  writes from Koksilah, Nanaimo, B.C., Canada:         ... of course I agree with your views: we have in this       Province been doing our best to put them in practice with       the most excellent results. Dr. W.T. Hornaday stirred us up,       and, though we did not put our sanctuaries exactly where he       suggested we took a hint from him and have been rewarded by       an extraordinary increase in big-horns, wapiti and other big       game. I, of course, have shot a great deal as a big game       hunter, but, thank God, I don't remember one wanton kill,       and I know I have not killed one per cent. of the beasts I       might have done. No one wants to....    The Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, ex-President of the United States,  writes:         I desire to extend my most earnest good wishes and       congratulations to the Commission of Conservation of Canada.       Your address on the need of animal sanctuaries in Labrador       must appeal, it seems to me, to every civilized man. The       great naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace, in his book, \"The       World of Life,\" recently published, says that all who       profess religion, or sincerely believe in the Deity, the       designer and maker of this world and of every living thing,       as well as all lovers of Nature, should treat the wanton and       brutal destruction of living things and of forests as among       the first of forbidden sins. In his own words, \"All the       works of Nature, animate or inanimate, should be invested       with a certain sanctity, to be used by us but not abused,       and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute       a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or a beast,       should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes.       Never before has there been such widespread ravage of the       earth's surface by the destruction of vegetation, and with       it, animal life, and such wholesale defacement of the earth.       The nineteenth century saw the rise and development and       culmination of these crimes against God and man. Let us hope       that the twentieth century will see the rise of a truer       religion, a purer Christianity.\" I have condensed what Mr.       Wallace said because it is too long to quote in full. He       shows that this wanton and brutal defacement of Nature, this       annihilation of the natural resources that should be part of       the National capital of our children and children's       children, this destruction of so much that is beautiful and       grand, goes hand in hand with the sordid selfishness which       is responsible for so very much of the misery of our       civilization. The movement for the conservation of our       natural resources, for the protection of our forests and of       the wild life of the woods, the mountains and the coasts, is       essentially a democratic movement. Democracy, in its       essence, means that a few people shall not be allowed for       their own selfish gratification, to destroy what ought to       belong to the people as a whole. The men who destroy our       forests for their own immediate pecuniary benefit, the men       who make a lifeless desert of what were once coasts teeming       with a wonderfully varied bird life, these, whether rich or       poor, and their fellows in destruction of every type, are       robbing the whole people, are robbing the citizens of the       future of their natural rights. Over most of the United       States, over all of South Africa and large portions of       Canada, this destruction was permitted to go on to the       bitter end. It is late now, but it is not too late for us to       put a stop to the process elsewhere. What is being done in       Labrador is substantially what was done, and is still, in       places, being done in Florida. A resolute effort is now       being made by the Audubon Societies, and all kindred       organizations, to stop the waste in the United States. Great       good can be done by this effort, for there is still very       much left to save in the United States. But there is very       much more left to save in Canada. Canada has taken the lead       in many matters of far-reaching importance to the future       welfare of mankind, and has taught other nations much. She       can teach no more important lesson to other nations, and       incidentally, she can benefit herself in no more striking       way, than by resolutely setting to work to preserve her       forests, and the strange and beautiful wild creatures, both       beasts and birds, of her forests and her sea-coasts.       Labrador offers one of the best of all possible fields for       such work. The forests, the wild beasts and wild birds of       Labrador can be kept perpetually as one of the great assets       of Canada; or they can he destroyed in a spirit of brutal       and careless vandalism, with no permanent benefit to anyone,       and with the effect of ruining the country and preventing       its ever becoming what it otherwise would become. The       economic argument is by no means the only argument, and, in       my eyes, is hardly the most important argument for       preserving the forests and wild life of Labrador, as your       Commission desires to preserve them, but it is in itself so       important that, even though there were no other reason to be       adduced, it would amply warrant the taking of the action       you recommend. I extend you my warmest good wishes for the       success of your movement.    Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton writes:         ... your most interesting and convincing address on _Animal       Sanctuaries in Labrador_. You certainly have hit the nail on       the head. It is now demonstrated by experiments in many       parts of the world that the only sure way to preserve       indefinitely a supply of wild animals is by giving them       well-placed, well-selected sanctuaries, wherein at all       seasons they are safe. I am delighted to know that you are       taking up this important matter with such vigor.    _South Africa_. Major Hamilton, Superintendent, Transvaal Government  Game Reserves, Koomatipoort, says:         I have been much interested in reading Col. Wood's address.       They seem to have the same difficulties to contend with       there as we have here, _i.e._, ignorance and apathy of the       public, and active opposition from those with axes to grind.    Major Hamilton encloses the _Regulations under Section_ 4 _of the Game  Preservation Ordinance_, 1905, (C)--_Reserves_. By these it appears  that \"owners of private land situate in a Reserve or persons having  the permission in writing of such owners shall have free access to  every part of such land.\" But routes of access in the Reserve  generally are exactly defined and must be followed. Penalties up to  L50 may be imposed for the infraction of any one of six different  clauses. Major Hamilton also says:         The Game Sanctuaries of the Transvaal stretch along the       eastern border of the Province for a length of 250 miles       with an average breadth of 50 miles.         They are in charge of a Warden under whom are six Rangers.       Five of these Rangers are in charge of each of one of the       five areas into which the Reserves are divided, four for the       Sabi Reserve and one for the Singwitsi Reserve, and each has       at his disposal a force of 12 native rangers or police. The       sixth Ranger is specially employed in the capture of live       animals for zoological purposes, the destruction of vermin       and for any emergency duty which may arise. His headquarters       are, therefore, within easy reach of the Warden.         The Warden has, further, in the districts included in the       Game Reserve, the powers of a Resident Justice of the Peace,       a Sub Native Commissioner, and a Customs Officer, while the       Rangers, white and native, have the full powers and duties       of police. The area is therefore quite self-contained, and       at the Warden's headquarters, are police barracks, court       house and lock-up, and a post of the Transvaal police in       charge of a corporal is permanently stationed there. The       special by-laws which are enforced are set forth in the       attached slip. There are about 4,000 natives, all told,       resident within the area. Most of them have been admitted as       residents on condition of their giving assistance to the       staff, and hold their tenure conditionally on their       behaviour. This system has been found to work admirably,       for, while practically no harm is done by these residents,       very considerable assistance has been obtained from them in       detecting poachers.         All carnivorous mammals are treated as vermin and are       systematically destroyed.         No shooting or hunting of any kind is permitted in the       Reserve, and in fact members of the public except on special       permit are not allowed to carry firearms or to leave certain       main tracks.         The species of game mammals found are as follows: Elephant,       rhinoceros, hippopotamus, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, sable and       roan antelope, kudu, water buck, blue wilde-beest, impalla,       reed buck, bush-buck, steenbok, duiker, klipspringer,       mountain reed buck, red duiker.         Of game birds there are: five kinds of francolin, two kinds       of knorhaan, sand grouse,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],[0,"My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#5)"],[1,"Princess, fell so deeply in love with her from what he had heard,  that he could neither eat nor sleep.    So an ambassador was sent with a magnificent chariot, more than a  hundred horses, and fifty pages, to bring the Princess to the King,  and great preparations were made for her reception.    [Illustration: \"AN AMBASSADOR WAS SENT WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED  HORSES, AND FIFTY PAGES TO BRING THE PRINCESS TO THE KING.\"]    But whether the Princess Goldenhair was in an ill humour when the  ambassador arrived at her Court, or whatever was the reason, certain  it is that she sent a message to the young King thanking him but  saying that she did not wish to marry.    When the King heard of her refusal he wept like a child.    Now at his Court there was a young man called Avenant. He was as  beautiful as the sun, and a more finely made fellow than any in the  kingdom; everybody loved him except a few envious people, who were  angry because the King favoured and confided in him, and in the  presence of these, one day, Avenant incautiously remarked,    \"If the King had sent me to fetch the Princess Goldenhair, I am  certain she would have come,\" and these words were repeated to the  King in such a manner that they made him very angry, and he ordered  Avenant to be shut up in a high tower, to die of hunger.    In this sad plight, Avenant exclaimed one day, \"How have I offended  his Majesty? He has no more faithful subject than I.\"    The King who happened to be passing by the tower, heard this; he  called for Avenant to be brought forth who, throwing himself on his  knees, begged to know in what way he had offended his royal master.    \"You mocked me,\" said the King, \"you said that you would have  succeeded with the Princess Goldenhair where I have failed.\"    \"It is true, sir,\" replied Avenant, \"I did say so, for I would have  represented your noble qualities in such a way, that she could not  help being persuaded.\"    The King was convinced of the young man's sincerity, and with a letter  of introduction, Avenant set out for the Court of the goldenhaired  beauty, riding alone, according to his wish, and thinking as he went  how he best could woo the Princess for his beloved master.    One day, alighting from his horse to write down some suitable words  that had come into his mind, he saw a golden carp who, leaping from  the water to catch flies, had thrown herself upon the river bank, and  was now nearly dead.    Avenant pitied the poor thing, and put her carefully back into  the water. Recovering directly, the carp dived to the bottom, but  returning to the edge of the river, said,    \"Avenant, I thank you; you have saved my life, I will repay you;\" then  she swam off leaving the young man in great astonishment.    Another day as Avenant journeyed he noticed a raven who was pursued by  an eagle. \"What right has that eagle to persecute the raven? thought  Avenant, and he drew his bow and shot the fierce bird. The raven  perched on a bough and cried.    \"Avenant you have saved my life, I will not be ungrateful, I will  repay you.\"    [Illustration]    Not long after this, Avenant found an owl caught in a snare, he cut  the strings, and freed the trembling captive. \"Avenant,\" said the owl,  \"you have saved my life, I will repay you.\"    These three adventures were the most important that befell Avenant,  and he went on his way, shortly before he arrived at his destination  purchasing a beautiful little dog named Cabriole.    When Avenant reached the Palace of the Princess Goldenhair, and saw  the Princess seated upon her throne, she looked so lovely that at  first all his fine speeches forsook him, and he could not utter a  word; however, taking courage, he addressed her in exquisitely chosen  language, begging her to become the King's bride.    To this the Princess replied most graciously, saying that his petition  moved her more than any other could do, \"but know,\" she added, \"as I  was walking by the river a month ago, as I took off my glove, a ring,  that I greatly value, fell into the water, and I have vowed that I  will not heed any proposal of marriage, except from the ambassador who  brings me back my ring.\"    Sad at heart Avenant left the Palace, but his little dog, Cabriole,  said, \"My dear master, do not despair, you are too good to be unhappy.  Early to-morrow morning let us go to the river-side.\" Avenant patted  him, but did not answer, and, still sad, fell asleep.    As soon as it was day, Cabriole awoke him saying, \"Dress yourself, my  master, and come out.\"    They wandered down to the river, and there Avenant heard a voice  calling him, and what should he see but the golden carp, with the  Princess's ring in her mouth. \"Take it, dear Avenant,\" said she, \"I  promised to repay you for saving my life, and now I can fulfil my  promise.\"    Thanking her a thousand times, Avenant, going at once to the Palace,  said, \"Princess, your command is fulfilled; may it please you to  receive the King, my master, as your husband.\"    The Princess thought she must be dreaming when she saw the ring, but  she set Avenant another task.    \"Not far from here there is a prince named Galifron,\" said she; \"he  wishes to marry me, and threatens to ravish my kingdom if I refuse;  but how can I accept him? He is a giant, taller than my highest tower,  he eats a man as a monkey would eat a chestnut, and when he speaks,  his voice is so loud that it deafens those who hear him. He will not  take my refusal, but kills my subjects. You must fight and bring me  his head.\"    [Illustration]    \"Well, madam,\" replied Avenant, \"I will fight Galifron; I expect I  shall be killed, but I shall die a brave man.\" And, taking Cabriole,  Avenant set out for Galifron's country, asking news of the giant as he  went along, and the more he heard the more he feared him, but Cabriole  reassured him. \"My dear master,\" said the little dog, \"while you are  fighting him I will bite his legs, then he will stoop to chase me, and  you will kill him.\" Avenant admired the bravery of the little dog, but  he knew his help would not be sufficient.    Presently they perceived how the roads were covered with the bones of  the men that Galifron had eaten, and soon they saw the giant coming  towards them through a wood. His head was higher than the highest  trees, and he sang in a terrific voice:          \"Where are the children small, so small,        With my teeth I will crush them all,        On so many would I feed, feed, feed.        The whole world can't supply my need.\"    Using the same tune, Avenant began to sing:          \"Look down, here is Avenant beneath, beneath        He will draw from your head, the teeth, the teeth        Although he is not very big, 'tis true,        He is able to fight with such as you.\"    The giant put himself into a terrible passion, and would have killed  Avenant with one blow, only a raven from above flew at his head, and  pecked him straight in the eyes, so violently that he was blinded. He  began striking out on all sides, but Avenant avoided his blows, and  with his sword pierced him so many times that at last he fell to the  ground. Then Avenant cut off his head, and the raven, who had perched  on a tree, said,    \"I have not forgotten how you rescued me from the eagle; I promised to  repay you, I think I have done so to-day.\"    \"I owe everything to you, Mr. Raven,\" responded Avenant, as, holding  Galifron's head, he rode off.    When he entered the town, crowds followed him crying, \"Here is the  brave Avenant who has slain the monster.\"    Avenant advanced to the Princess, and said, \"Madam, your enemy is  dead. I hope you will no more refuse the King, my master.\"    \"Although it is so,\" answered the Princess, \"I shall refuse him unless  you will bring me some water from the Grotto of Darkness. At the  entrance there are two dragons, with fire in their eyes and mouths;  inside the grotto there is a deep pit into which you must descend, it  is full of toads, scorpions, and serpents. At the bottom of this pit  there is a little cave where flows the fountain of beauty and health.  Positively I must possess the water; all who wash in it, if they are  beautiful, continue so always, if they are ugly they become beautiful;  if they are young they remain young, if they are old they regain their  youth. You cannot wonder, Avenant, that I will not leave my kingdom  without taking it with me.\"    So once more Avenant and Cabriole set out; they journeyed on until  they came to a rock, black as ink, from which smoke was issuing, and  a moment later there appeared one of the dragons belching forth fire  from his eyes and mouth. He was a frightful looking creature with a  green and yellow body, and his tail was so long that it went into a  hundred curves. Avenant saw all this, but resolved to die, he drew his  sword, and, carrying the flask the Princess had given to him to hold  the water, he said to Cabriole:    \"My days are ended, I can never obtain that water the dragons are  guarding; when I am dead, fill this flask with my blood and carry it  to the Princess, that she may know what it has cost me, then go to the  King, my master, and tell him of my misfortune.\"    As he was speaking, a voice called, \"Avenant, Avenant,\" and looking  around he saw an owl. \"You saved my life from the fowlers,\" said the  owl. \"I promised to repay you, the time has now come. Give me your  flask. I will bring you the water of beauty.\"    And carrying the flask, the owl entered the grotto, unhindered,  returning in less than a quarter of an hour with it full to the brim.  Avenant thanked the owl heartily, and joyously started for the town,  where he presented the flask to the Princess, who immediately gave  orders to prepare for her departure.    But as she considered Avenant altogether charming, before she set out,  she several times said to him: \"If you wish, we need not go, for I  will make you king of my country.\" But Avenant made reply:    \""]]]
