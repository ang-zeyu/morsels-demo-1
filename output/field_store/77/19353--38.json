Our nation drives here a great trade for salt, and have commonly a  man-of-war here for the guard of our ships and barks that come to take it  in; of which I have been informed that in some years there have not been  less than 100 in a year. It costs nothing but men's labour to rake it  together, and wheel it out of the pond, except the carriage: and that  also is very cheap; the inhabitants having plenty of asses for which they  have little to do besides carrying the salt from the ponds to the seaside  at the season when ships are here. The inhabitants lade and drive their  asses themselves, being very glad to be employed; for they have scarce  any other trade but this to get a penny by. The pond is not above half a  mile from the landing-place, so that the asses make a great many trips in  a day. They have a set number of turns to and fro both forenoon and  afternoon, which their owners will not exceed. At the landing-place there  lies a frape-boat, as our seamen call it, to take in the salt. It is made  purposely for this use, with a deck reaching from the stern a third part  of the boat; where there is a kind of bulkhead that rises not from the  boat's bottom but from the edge of the deck to about 2 foot in height;  all caulked very tight. The use of it is to keep the waves from dashing  into the boat when it lies with its head to the shore to take in salt:  for here commonly runs a great sea; and when the boat lies so with its  head to the shore the sea breaks in over the stern, and would soon fill  it was it not for this bulkhead, which stops the waves that come flowing  upon the deck and makes them run off into the sea on each side. To keep  the boat thus with the head to the shore and the stern to the sea there  are two strong stanchions set up in the boat, the one at the head, the  other in the middle of it, against the bulkhead, and a foot higher than  the bulkhead. There is a large notch cut in the top of each of these  stanchions big enough for a small hawser or rope to lie in; one end of  which is fastened to a post ashore, and the other to a grappling or  anchor lying a pretty way off at sea: this rope serves to haul the boat  in and out, and the stanchions serve to keep her fast, so that she cannot  swing to either side when the rope is hauled tight: for the sea would  else fill her, or toss her ashore and stave her. The better to prevent  her staving and to keep her the tighter together there are two sets of  ropes more: the first going athwart from gunwale to gunwale, which, when  the rowers benches are laid, bind the boats sides so hard against the  ends of the benches that they cannot easily fall asunder, while the  benches and ropes mutually help each other; the ropes keeping the boat's  sides from flying off, and the benches from being crushed together  inwards. Of these ropes there are usually but two, dividing the boat's  length as they go across the sides into three equal parts. The other set  of ropes are more in number, and are so placed as to keep the ribs and  planks of the boat from starting off. For this purpose there are holes  made at certain distances through the edge of the keel that runs along on  the inside of the boat; through which these ropes passing are laid along  the ribs so as to line them, or be themselves as ribs upon them, being  made fast to them by rattans brought thither, or small cords twisted  close about both ropes and ribs, up to the gunwale: by which means though  several of the nails or pegs of the boat should by any shock fall out,  yet the ropes of these two sets might hold her together: especially with  the help of a rope going quite round about the gunwale on the outside, as  our longboats have. And such is the care taken to strengthen the boats;  from which girding them with ropes, which our seamen call fraping, they  have the name of frape-boats. Two men suffice to haul her in and out, and  take in the salt from shore (which is brought in bags) and put it out  again. As soon as the boat is brought nigh enough to the shore he who  stands by the bulkhead takes instantly a turn with the hawser about the  bulkhead stanchion; and that stops her fast before the sea can turn her  aside: and when the two men have got in their lading they haul off to sea  till they come a little without the swell; where they remove the salt  into another boat that carries it on board the ship. Without such a  frape-boat here is but bad landing at any time: for though it is commonly  very smooth in the road, yet there falls a great sea on the shore, so  that every ship that comes here should have such a boat, and bring or  make or borrow one of the other ships that happen to be here; for the  inhabitants have none. I have been thus particular in the description of  these frape-boats because of the use they may be of in any places where a  great sea falls in upon the shore: as it does especially in many open  roads in the East and West Indies; where they might therefore be very  serviceable; but I never saw any of them there.

OF THE NATIVES, THEIR TRADE AND LIVELIHOOD.    The island Mayo is generally barren, being dry, as I said; and the best  of it is but a very indifferent soil. The sandy bank that pens in the  salt pond has a sort of silk-cotton growing upon it, and a plant that  runs along upon the ground, branching out like a vine, but with thick  broad leaves. The silk-cotton grows on tender shrubs, 3 or 4 foot high,  in cods as big as an apple, but of a long shape; which when ripe open at  one end, parting leisurely into 4 quarters; and at the first opening the  cotton breaks forth. It may be of use for stuffing of pillows, or the  like, but else is of no value, any more than that of the great  cotton-tree. I took of these cods before that were quite ripe, and laid  them in my chest; and in 2 or 3 days they would open and throw out the  cotton. Others I have bound fast with strings, so that the cod could not  open; and in a few days after, as soon as I slackened the string never so  little, the cod would burst and the cotton fly out forcibly at a very  little hole, just as the pulp out of a roasting apple, till all has been  out of the cod. I met with this sort of cotton afterwards at Timor (where  it was ripe in November) and nowhere else in all my travels; but I found  two other sorts of silk-cotton at Brazil, which I shall there describe.  The right cotton-shrub grows here also, but not on the sandbank. I saw  some bushes of it near the shore; but the most of it is planted in the  middle of the isle, where the inhabitants live, cotton-cloth being their  chief manufacture; but neither is there any great store of this cotton.  There also are some trees within the island, but none to be seen near the  seaside; nothing but a few bushes scattering up and down against the  sides of the adjacent hills; for as I said before the land is pretty high  from the sea. The soil is for the most part either a sort of sand, or  loose crumbling stone, without any fresh-water ponds or streams to  moisten it, but only showers in the wet season which run off as fast as  they fall, except a small spring in the middle of the isle, from which  proceeds a little stream of water that runs through a valley between the  hills. There the inhabitants live in three small towns, having a church  and padre in each town: and these towns, as I was informed, are 6 or 7  miles from the road. Pinose is said to be the chief town, and to have 2  churches: St. John's the next, and the third Lagoa. The houses are very  mean: small, low things. They build with figtree, here being, as I was  told, no other trees fit to build with. The rafters are a sort of wild  cane. The fruits of this isle are chiefly figs and watermelons. They have  also callavances (a sort of pulse like French beans) and pumpkins for  ordinary food. The fowls are flamingos, great curlews, and guinea-hens,  which the natives of those islands call galena pintata, or the painted  hen; but in Jamaica, where I have seen also those birds in the dry  savannahs and woods (for they love to run about in such places) they are  called guinea-hens. They seem to be much of the nature of partridges.  They are bigger than our hens, have long legs, and will run apace. They  can fly too but not far, having large heavy bodies and but short wings  and short tails: as I have generally observed that birds have seldom long  tails unless such as fly much; in which their tails are usually  serviceable to their turning about as a rudder to a ship or boat. These  birds have thick and strong yet sharp bills, pretty long claws, and short  tails. They feed on the ground, either on worms, which they find by  tearing open the earth; or on grasshoppers, which are plentiful here. The  feathers of these birds are speckled with dark and light grey; the spots  so regular and uniform that they look more beautiful than many birds that  are decked with gayer feathers. Their necks are small and long; their  heads also but little. The cocks have a small rising on their crowns,  like a sort of a comb. It is of the colour of a dry walnut shell, and  very hard. They have a small red gill on each side of their heads, like  ears, strutting out downwards; but the hens have none. They are so strong  that one cannot hold them; and very hardy. They are very good meat,  tender, and sweet; and in some the flesh is extraordinary white; though  some others have black flesh: but both sorts are very good. The natives  take them with dogs, running them down whenever they please; for here are  abundance of them. You shall see 2 or 300 in a company.

So here, for the present, Grandfather suspended  the history of his chair.          Chapter V      The Children had now learned to look upon the chair with an interest,  which was almost the same as if it were a conscious being, and could  remember the many famous people whom it had held within its arms.    Even Charley, lawless as he was, seemed to feel that this venerable chair  must not be clambered upon nor overturned, although he had no scruple in  taking such liberties with every other chair in the house. Clara treated  it with still greater reverence, often taking occasion to smooth its  cushion, and to brush the dust from the carved flowers and grotesque  figures of its oaken back and arms. Laurence would sometimes sit a whole  hour, especially at twilight, gazing at the chair, and, by the spell of  his imaginations, summoning up its ancient occupants to appear in it  again.    Little Alice evidently employed herself in a similar way; for once, when  Grandfather had gone abroad, the child was heard talking with the gentle  Lady Arbella, as if she were still sitting in the chair. So sweet a child  as little Alice may fitly talk with angels, such as the Lady Arbella had  long since become.    Grandfather was soon importuned for more stories about the chair. He had  no difficulty in relating them; for it really seemed as if every person,  noted in our early history, had, on some occasion or other, found repose  within its comfortable arms. If Grandfather took pride in any thing, it  was in being the possessor of such an honorable and historic elbow chair.    \"I know not precisely who next got possession of the chair, after Governor  Vane went back to England,\" said Grandfather. \"But there is reason to  believe that President Dunster sat in it, when he held the first  commencement at Harvard College. You have often heard, children, how  careful our forefathers were, to give their young people a good education.  They had scarcely cut down trees enough to make room for their own  dwellings, before they began to think of establishing a college. Their  principal object was, to rear up pious and learned ministers; and hence  old writers call Harvard College a school of the prophets.\"    \"Is the college a school of the prophets now?\" asked Charley.    \"It is a long while since I took my degree, Charley. You must ask some of  the recent graduates,\" answered Grandfather. \"As I was telling you,  President Dunster sat in Grandfather's chair in 1642, when he conferred  the degree of bachelor of arts on nine young men. They were the first in  America, who had received that honor. And now, my dear auditors, I must  confess that there are contradictory statements and some uncertainty about  the adventures of the chair, for a period of almost ten years. Some say  that it was occupied by your own ancestor, William Hawthorne, first  Speaker of the House of Representatives. I have nearly satisfied myself,  however, that, during most of this questionable period, it was literally  the Chair of State. It gives me much pleasure to imagine, that several  successive governors of Massachusetts sat in it at the council board.\"    \"But, Grandfather,\" interposed Charley, who was a matter-of-fact little  person, \"what reason have you to imagine so?\"    \"Pray do imagine it, Grandfather,\" said Laurence.    \"With Charley's permission, I will,\" replied Grandfather, smiling. \"Let us  consider it settled, therefore, that Winthrop, Bellingham, Dudley, and  Endicott, each of them, when chosen governor, took his seat in our great  chair on election day. In this chair, likewise, did those excellent  governors preside, while holding consultations with the chief counsellors  of the province, who were styled Assistants. The governor sat in this  chair, too, whenever messages were brought to him from the chamber of  Representatives.\"    And here Grandfather took occasion to talk, rather tediously, about the  nature and forms of government that established themselves, almost  spontaneously, in Massachusetts and the other New England colonies.  Democracies were the natural growth of the new world. As to Massachusetts,  it was at first intended that the colony should be governed by a council  in London. But, in a little while, the people had the whole power in their  own hands, and chose annually the governor, the counsellors, and the  representatives. The people of old England had never enjoyed any thing  like the liberties and privileges, which the settlers of New England now  possessed. And they did not adopt these modes of government after long  study, but in simplicity, as if there were no other way for people to be  ruled.    \"But, Laurence,\" continued Grandfather, \"when you want instruction on  these points, you must seek it in Mr. Bancroft's History. I am merely  telling the history of a chair. To proceed. The period during which the  governors sat in our chair, was not very full of striking incidents. The  province was now established on a secure foundation; but it did not  increase so rapidly as at first, because the Puritans were no longer  driven from England by persecution. However, there was still a quiet and  natural growth. The legislature incorporated towns, and made new purchases  of lands from the Indians. A very memorable event took place in 1643. The  colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven, formed a  union, for the purpose of assisting each other in difficulties, and for  mutual defence against their enemies. They called themselves the United  Colonies of New England.\"    \"Were they under a government like that of the United States?\" inquired  Laurence.    \"No,\" replied Grandfather, \"the different colonies did not compose one  nation together; it was merely a confederacy among the governments. It  somewhat resembled the league of the Amphictyons, which you remember in  Grecian history. But to return to our chair. In 1644 it was highly  honored; for Governor Endicott sat in it, when he gave audience to an  ambassador from the French governor of Acadie, or Nova Scotia. A treaty of  peace, between Massachusetts and the French colony, was then signed.\"    \"Did England allow Massachusetts to make war and peace with foreign  countries?\" asked Laurence.    \"Massachusetts, and the whole of New England, was then almost independent  of the mother country,\" said Grandfather. \"There was now a civil war in  England; and the king, as you may well suppose, had his hands full at  home, and could pay but little attention to these remote colonies. When  the Parliament got the power into their hands, they likewise had enough to  do in keeping down the Cavaliers. Thus New England, like a young and hardy  lad, whose father and mother neglect it, was left to take care of itself.  In 1649, King Charles was beheaded. Oliver Cromwell then became Protector  of England; and as he was a Puritan himself, and had risen by the valor of  the English Puritans, he showed himself a loving and indulgent father to  the Puritan colonies in America.\"    Grandfather might have continued to talk in this dull manner, nobody knows  how long; but, suspecting that Charley would find the subject rather dry,  he looked sideways at that vivacious little fellow, and saw him give an  involuntary yawn. Whereupon, Grandfather proceeded with the history of the  chair, and related a very entertaining incident, which will be found in  the next chapter.          Chapter VI      \"According to the most authentic records, my dear children,\" said  Grandfather, \"the chair, about this time, had the misfortune to break its  leg. It was probably on account of this accident, that it ceased to be the  seat of the governors of Massachusetts; for, assuredly, it would have been  ominous of evil to the commonwealth, if the Chair of State had tottered  upon three legs. Being therefore sold at auction,--alas! what a vicissitude  for a chair that had figured in such high company, our venerable friend  was knocked down to a certain Captain John Hull. This old gentleman, on  carefully examining the maimed chair, discovered that its broken leg might  be clamped with iron and made as serviceable as ever.\"    \"Here is the very leg that was broken!\" exclaimed Charley, throwing  himself down on the floor to look at it. \"And here are the iron clamps.  How well it was mended!\"    When they had all sufficiently examined the broken leg, Grandfather told  them a story about Captain John Hull and        THE PINE-TREE SHILLINGS      The Captain John Hull, aforesaid, was the mint-master of Massachusetts,  and coined all the money that was made there. This was a new line of  business: for, in the earlier days of the colony, the current coinage  consisted of gold and silver money of England, Portugal, and Spain. These  coins being scarce, the people were often forced to barter their  commodities, instead of selling them.    For instance, if a man wanted to buy a coat, he perhaps exchanged a  bear-skin for it. If he wished for a barrel of molasses, he might purchase  it with a pile of pine boards. Musket-bullets were used instead of  farthings. The Indians had a sort of money, called wampum, which was made  of clam-shells; and this strange sort of specie was likewise taken in  payment of debts, by the English settlers. Bank-bills had never been heard  of. There was not money enough of any kind, in many parts of the country,  to pay the salaries of the ministers; so that they sometimes had to take  quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or cords of wood, instead of silver or  gold.    As the people grew more numerous, and their trade one with another  increased, the want of current money was still more sensibly felt. To  supply the demand, the general court passed a law for establishing a  coinage of shillings, sixpences, and threepences. Captain John Hull was  appointed to"]]]
