Separate rosettes like the pattern may  be joined together with smaller ones, and form a very pretty couvrette.  The pattern is worked in rounds. Begin the rosette with a circle,  consisting of 4 double, 1 purl, 6 double, 1 purl, 6 double, 1 purl, 4  double. Take up another shuttle, and work over the cotton on it, fasten  the end on the last double of the circle and work over it, beginning  close to the circle, 6 plain, 1 circle like the 1st worked with the 1st  shuttle, and which is fastened on the last purl of the 1st circle at the  place of the 1st purl; 6 plain, and continue to work so alternately till  you have 7 circles divided by 6 plain stitches. Draw up very tightly the  cotton over which you work, so that the circles form a rosette, which is  closed by sewing together the two corresponding purl of the first and  last circle. Both the ends of the cotton over which you have worked are  knotted together. For the 2nd round, fasten the cotton on one shuttle on  the middle purl of a circle, work a circle like those of the 1st round,  take up the 2nd shuttle, and work on exactly as in the 1st round, only  work 8 plain between the circles over the cotton on the 2nd shuttle. The  2nd round consists of 15 circles; the cotton with which you work must be  fastened at the required places on the middle purl of a circle of the  preceding round. The 3rd and following rounds are worked in the same  manner; the number of circles must be such as to keep the couvrette  quite flat. In the pattern the 3rd round has 26 circles. Fasten the  cotton well after each round.    [Illustration: 25.--Centre of a Tatted Couvrette.]           *       *       *       *       *    26.--_Tatted Lace_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 30;  tatting-pin No. 2.      [Illustration: 26.--Tatted Lace.]    This very simple lace consists of scallops which look as if they were  slightly gathered. It must be worked with tatting cotton. Each scallop  consists of 5 plain, 1 purl, 5 plain, then alternately 5 purled  stitches, draw up these stitches till the cotton between the 1st and  last stitch is two-fifths of an inch long, and work a 2nd similar  scallop at a short distance from the 1st. But in the following scallops  fasten each to the last purl of the preceding scallop instead of working  the 1st purl.           *       *       *       *       *    27.--_Tatted Lace_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 50 or 80;  tatting-pin No. 3.    [Illustration: 27.--Tatted Lace.]    This pretty lace is worked with fine tatting cotton. Work with 2  threads; the knots are worked over the cotton, which is held in the  right hand. Work first the outer scallops of the lace    Fasten both ends of cotton together and make 10 double, divided by 1  purl, turn the work so as to turn the wrong side upwards, fasten the  cotton over which you work on to the last purl, go back over the same  row, miss 1 purl next to the cotton with which you work, 9 double  divided by 1 purl, fastening the cotton over which you work on the next  purl of the 1st row after every double stitch. This forms 1 scallop. *  Turn the work downwards (that is, the purl stitch must be turned  downwards), make 4 times 2 double, 1 purl, 1 purled stitch: this is the  straight row between 2 outer scallops of the lace. Then work a scallop  like the preceding one, fastening it from illustration after the first  row on the middle one of the 9 outer purl of the preceding scallop, with  the cotton over which you work; repeat from * till the lace is long  enough, and fasten the cotton. Knot both ends together again, fasten the  cotton over which you work on the first purl of the first scallop, make  9 double, 1 short purl, 1 double, turn so that the upper edge of the row  is turned downwards, and the scallops upwards, 5 double, fasten the 2  middle purl of the 4 of the next straight row together by drawing the  cotton, with which you are working through the 2nd purl, so as to form a  loop, draw the cotton over which you work through this loop and draw up  the latter; work 5 double, fasten the cotton over which you work on to  the short purl worked after 9 double, turn the work so that the outer  scallops of the lace are turned downwards, 10 double, fasten the cotton  over which you work on the first purl of the next scallop, repeat from  *, and fasten the cotton. After having fastened both ends together  again, turn the work the right side upwards and the outer scallops  upwards also, fasten the cotton over which you work on to the short purl  which is under the first loop; * work 4 times 2 double, 1 purl, 2  double, fasten the cotton over which you work on the purl under the  next loop, and repeat from * till the lace is completed.           *       *       *       *       *    28.--_Collar in Tatting and Darned Netting_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40;  tatting-pin No. 3; Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s French embroidery  cotton No. 60; square netting.    [Illustration: 28.--Collar in Tatting and Darned Netting]    The pattern is worked with very fine cotton; the netted grounding over a  mesh measuring two-fifths of an inch round. The collar is ornamented  round the outer edge with a tatted lace. Work a straight strip of  netting for the grounding; begin with 2 stitches, work 18 rows backwards  and forwards, increasing 1 at the end of each row, so that the last row  has 19 holes; work 1 row without increasing; then continue to work with  the same number of stitches, increasing 1 at the end of one row and  decreasing 1 at the end of the other. When the strip is sufficiently  long, work 1 row again without increasing or decreasing, and form  the side by making 18 rows, decreasing 1 stitch at the end of each,  cast off the 2 last stitches on 1 stitch without forming a new stitch on  the needle. Trace the outline of the collar on the grounding with thick  cotton, and begin to darn it from illustration. When the darning is  completed work the tatted lace with the same cotton, as follows:--6  double, 1 short purl, alternately, 3 times 3 double, 1 purl, 6 double,  draw up the stitch so as to form a scallop leaving one-fifth of an inch  between the first and last stitch; work a second scallop at a short  distance from the first, and so on; every scallop is fastened on to the  preceding one after the first 3 double stitches. Work a row of double  overcast stitch between the darned netting and the tatted lace; work  this row over the cotton tracing, marking the outline of the collar on  the grounding and over the cotton between the tatted scallops. Work also  a row of double overcast round the neck part, gathering in the collar a  little if necessary. Cut away the netting on the wrong side close to the  row of overcast stitches.           *       *       *       *       *    29.--_Mignardise and Tatting_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40; fine  mignardise braid.    [Illustration: 29.--Mignardise and Tatting.]    Patterns formed of mignardise and tatting are of quite new style, and  look very pretty. The insertion is easy to work by the following  process:--Make first a circle, as follows: 1 plain stitch, 2 double, 1  purl, 6 double, 1 purl, 2 double, 1 plain; fasten the cotton on to one  side of the mignardise, at the distance of about five-eighths of an  inch, by taking 2 loops of it together; work a second circle at a short  distance from the first, and so on. When the strip of insertion is  sufficiently long, work in the same manner on the other side of the  mignardise. This kind of work is destined to become very popular, and  nothing can be more light and graceful than the union of mignardise and  tatting.           *       *       *       *       *    30.--_Linen Bag for Cotton_.    Materials: Fine linen, 6 inches square; Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s  tatting cotton No. 40.    [Illustration: 30.--Linen Bag for Cotton.]    The bag seen in illustration No. 30 is meant to keep the cotton for  working a couvrette; it consists of a round piece, measuring 6 inches  across, which is hemmed all round, and trimmed with a tatted lace. It is  drawn together at top.           *       *       *       *       *    31.--_Tatting Insertion_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s cotton No. 30.    The insertion shown in illustration No. 31 is composed in two similar  halves. Begin the first in the following way:--10 double, 1 purl, 3  double, 1 purl, 10 double, join the stitches into a circle, and work a  second similar circle at a distance of one-third of an inch; instead of  the 1st purl, draw the cotton through the 2nd purl of the first-worked  circle; leave an interval of one-eighth of an inch, and repeat the two  rounds till the insertion is sufficiently long. Then tat round the  pieces of cotton which join the two rounds, work round the longest 10  double, and round the shortest 4 double, inserting the shuttle  alternately once upwards and once downwards, but for the rest proceeding  as in the common button-hole stitch. When the first half is completed,  work the second in the same way, and fasten it on to the first with the  purl.

[Illustration: 32.--Tatting Insertion.]    The pretty effect of the insertion shown in illustration No. 32 is  obtained by means of longer and shorter purl. Work as follows:--Join 9  double into a circle, 1 long purl, 3 double, 1 long purl, 4 double *.  After an interval of five-eighths of an inch, begin the large figure of  the pattern: 2 double, 1 small purl, 2 double, draw the cotton through  the last purl of the small circle, 2 double, drawn through the 1st purl  of the same circle, 2 double, 1 small purl, 2 double, 1 long purl, 2  double, 1 small"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15154"],[0,"Psychology and Industrial Efficiency (#5)"],[1,"the man who is a failure in his  chosen vocation, and who has been thrown out of it, to happen to come  into the career in which he can make a success. Social statistics show  with an appalling clearness what a burden and what a danger to the  social body is growing from the masses of those who do not succeed and  who by their lack of success become discouraged and embittered. The  social psychologist cannot resist the conviction that every single  one could have found a place in which he could have achieved something  of value for the commonwealth. The laborer, who in spite of his best  efforts shows himself useless and clumsy before one machine, might  perhaps have done satisfactory work in the next mill where the  machines demand another type of mental reaction. His psychical rhythm  and his inner functions would be able to adjust themselves to the  requirements of the one kind of labor and not to those of the other.  Truly the whole social body has had to pay a heavy penalty for not  making even the faintest effort to settle systematically the  fundamental problem of vocational choice, the problem of the psychical  adaptation of the individuality. An improvement would lie equally in  the interest of those who seek positions and those who have positions  to offer. The employers can hope that in all departments better work  will be done as soon as better adapted individuals can be obtained;  and, on the other hand, those who are anxious to make their working  energies effective may expect that the careful selection of individual  mental characters for the various tasks of the world will insure not  only greater success and gain, but above all greater joy in the work,  deeper satisfaction, and more harmonious unfolding of the personality.          V    SCIENTIFIC VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE      Observations of this kind, which refer to the borderland region  between psychology and social politics, are valid for all modern  nations. Yet it is hardly a chance that the first efforts toward a  systematic overcoming of some of these difficulties have been made  with us in America. The barriers between the classes lie lower; here  the choice of a vocation is less determined by tradition; and it  belongs to the creed of political democracy that just as everybody can  be called to the highest elective offices, so everybody ought to be  fit for any vocation in any sphere of life. The wandering from calling  to calling is more frequent in America than anywhere else. To be sure,  this has the advantage that a failure in one vocation does not bring  with it such a serious injury as in Europe, but it contributes much to  the greater danger that any one may jump recklessly and without  preparation into any vocational stream.    It is fresh in every one's mind how during the last decade the  economic conscience of the whole American nation became aroused. Up to  the end of the last century the people had lived with the secure  feeling of possessing a country with inexhaustible treasures. The last  few years brought the reaction, and it became increasingly clear how  irresponsible the national attitude had been, how the richness of the  forests and the mines and the rivers had been recklessly squandered  without any thought of the future. Conservation of the national  possessions suddenly became the battle-cry, and this turned the eye  also to that limitless waste of human material, a waste going on  everywhere in the world, but nowhere more widely than in the United  States. The feeling grew that no waste of valuable possessions is so  reckless as that which results from the distributing of living force  by chance methods instead of examining carefully how work and workmen  can fit one another. While this was the emotional background, two  significant social movements originated in our midst. The two  movements were entirely independent of each other, but from two  different starting-points they worked in one respect toward the same  goal. They are social and economic movements, neither of which at  first had anything directly to do with psychological questions; but  both led to a point where the psychological turn of the problem seemed  unavoidable. Here begins the obligation of the psychologist, and the  possibility of fulfilling this obligation will be the topic of our  discussion concerning the selection of the best man.    These two American movements which we have in mind are the effort to  furnish to pupils leaving the school guidance in their choice of a  vocation, and the nowadays still better known movement toward  scientific management in commerce and industry. The movement toward  vocational guidance is externally still rather modest and confined to  very narrow circles, but it is rapidly spreading and is not without  significant achievements. It started in Boston. There the late Mr.  Parsons once called a meeting of all the boys of his neighborhood who  were to leave the elementary schools at the end of the year. He wanted  to consider with them whether they had reasonable plans for their  future. At the well-attended meeting it became clear that the boys  knew little concerning what they had to expect in practical life, and  Parsons was able to give them, especially in individual discussions,  much helpful information. They knew too little of the characteristic  features of the vocations to which they wanted to devote themselves,  and they had given hardly any attention to the question whether they  had the necessary qualifications for the special work. From this germ  grew a little office which was opened in 1908, in which all Boston  boys and girls at the time when they left school were to receive  individual suggestions with reference to the most reasonable and best  adjusted selection of a calling. There is hardly any doubt that the  remarkable success of this modest beginning was dependent upon the  admirable personality of the late organizer, who recognized the  individual features with unusual tact and acumen. But he himself had  no doubt that such a merely impressionistic method could not satisfy  the demands. He saw that a threefold advance would become necessary.  First, it was essential to analyze the objective relations of the many  hundred kinds of accessible vocations. Their economic, hygienic,  technical, and social elements ought to be examined so that every boy  and girl could receive reliable information as to the demands of the  vocation and as to the prospects and opportunities in it. Secondly, it  would become essential to interest the schools in all these complex  questions of vocational choice, so that, by observation of individual  tendencies and abilities of the pupils, the teachers might furnish  preparatory material for the work of the institute for vocational  guidance. Thirdly,--and this is for us the most important point,--he  saw that the methods had to be elaborated in such a way that the  personal traits and dispositions might be discovered with much  greater exactitude and with much richer detail than was possible  through what a mere call on the vocational counselor could unveil.[3]    It is well known how this Boston bureau has stimulated a number of  American cities to come forward with similar beginnings. The  pedagogical circles have been especially aroused by the movement,  municipal and philanthropic boards have at least approached this group  of problems, two important conferences for vocational guidance have  met in New York, and at various places the question has been discussed  whether or not a vocational counselor might be attached to the schools  in a position similar to that of the school physician. The chief  progress has been made in the direction of collecting reliable data  with reference to the economic and hygienic conditions of the various  vocations, the demand and supply and the scale of wages. In short,  everything connected with the externalities of the vocations has been  carefully analyzed, and sufficient reliable material has been gained,  at least regarding certain local conditions. In the place of  individual advice, we have thus to a certain degree obtained general  economic investigations from which each can gather what he needs. It  seems that sometimes the danger of letting such offices degenerate  into mere agencies for employment has not been avoided, but that is  one of the perils of the first development. The mother institute in  Boston, too, under its new direction emphasizes more the economic and  hygienic side, and has set its centre of gravity in a systematic  effort to propagate understanding of the problems of vocational  guidance and to train professional vocational counselors in systematic  courses, who are then to carry the interest over the land.[4]    The real psychological analysis with which the movement began has,  therefore, been somewhat pushed aside for a while, and the officers of  those institutes declare frankly that they want to return to the  mental problem only after professional psychologists have sufficiently  worked out the specific methods for its mastery. Most counselors seem  to feel instinctively that the core of the whole matter lies in the  psychological examination, but they all agree that for this they must  wait until the psychological laboratories can furnish them with really  reliable means and schemes. Certainly it is very important, for  instance, that boys with weak lungs be kept away from such industrial  vocations as have been shown by the statistics to be dangerous for the  lungs, or that the onrush to vocations be stopped where the statistics  allow it to be foreseen that there will soon be an oversupply of  workers. But, after all, it remains much more decisive for the welfare  of the community, and for the future life happiness of those who leave  the school, that every one turn to those forms of work to which his  psychological traits are adjusted, or at least that he be kept away  from those in"]]]
