If  we take the analogous case of the nagual or \"individual totem\" there  seems to be no trace of any belief in the kinship of those who have the  same animal as their nagual, but are otherwise bound by no tie of  relationship. Yet if Dr Frazer's theory were correct, this is precisely  what we ought to find.    This is, however, no reason for rejecting the general proposition that  kinship, at its origin, was not hereditary; or, more exactly, that the  beginnings of the kinship groups found at the present day may be traced  back to a point at which the hereditary principle virtually disappears,  although the bond of union and perhaps the totem name already existed.  If, as suggested by Mr Lang, man was originally distributed in small  communities, known by names which ultimately came to be those of the  totem kins, we may suppose that daily association would not fail to  bring about that sense of solidarity in its members which it is found to  produce in more advanced communities. In the case of the tribe an even  feebler bond, the possession of a common language, seems to give the  tribesmen a sense of the unity of the tribe, though perhaps other  explanations may be suggested, such as the possession in common of the  tribal land, or the origin of the tribe from a single blood-related  group. However this may be, it seems reasonable to look for one factor  of the first bond of union in the influence of the daily and hourly  association of group-mates. On the other hand, if, as Mr Lang supposes,  the original group was a consanguine one, the claims of the factor of  consanguinity and perhaps of foster brotherhood and motherhood cannot be  neglected. It may be true, as Dr Frazer argues, that man was originally  and still is in some cases ignorant of physiological facts. But all  races of man and a great part of the rest of the animal kingdom show us  the phenomena of parental affection, of care for offspring and sometimes  of union for their defence. This does not, it may be noted, imply any  predominance of the mother.[11]    We may suppose that the idea of kinship or the recognition of  consanguinity, whichever be the more correct term to apply to these  far-off developments of the factors of human society, extended only by  degrees beyond the limits of the group. First, perhaps, came the naming  of the group, already, it may be, exogamous; then came the recognition  of the fact that those members of it, viz. the women, who passed to  community B after being born and having resided for years in community  A, were in reality, in spite of their change of residence, still in fact  the kin of community A; finally came the step of assigning to their  children the group names which were retained by their mothers from the  original natal groups. This brings us face to face with the first of the  fundamental questions of descent, to which allusion has been made.    It is commonly assumed by students of primitive social organisation that  matrilineal descent is the earlier and that it has everywhere preceded  patrilineal descent; but the questions involved are highly complicated  and it can hardly be said that the subject has been fully discussed.    Much of what has been said on the point has been vitiated by the  introduction of foreign factors. Thus, the child belongs to the tribe of  the father where the wife removes to the husband's local group or tribe.  But though it may be taken as a mark of matrilineal institutions, often  associated with matria potestas or its analogue the rule of the mother's  brother, that the husband should remove and live with the wife, we are  by no means entitled to say that the removal of the wife to the husband  implies a different state of things. Customs of residence are no guide  to the principles on which descent is regulated. Consequently it is  entirely erroneous to import into the discussion with which we are  concerned, viz. the rules by which _kinship_ is determined, any  considerations based on the rules by which membership of a _tribe_ is  settled.    Similarly, no proof of the existence of paternal authority in the family  throws any light on the question of whether the children belong to the  kin of the father rather than of the mother. Where the mother or  mother's brother is the guardian, we are usually safe in assuming that  descent is or has been until recently matrilineal. But from the  undisputed existence of patria potestas no similar inference can be  drawn.    Again, as will be shown below, not even the tie of blood between parent  and child, confined though it may be in the opinion of the people whose  institutions are in question, to a single parent, is an index to the way  in which is determined the kinship organisation to which the child  belongs.    It is therefore clear that the utmost discrimination is necessary in  dealing with these questions; rules of descent must be kept apart from  matters which indeed influence the evolution of the rules but are in no  way decisive as to their form at any given moment.    Returning now to the alleged priority of matrilineal descent in  determining the kinship organisation into which a child passes, it may  be said that whereas evidences of the passage from female to male  reckoning may be observed,[12] there is virtually none of a change in  the opposite direction. In other words, where kinship is reckoned in the  female line, there is no ground for supposing that it was ever  hereditary in any other way. On the other hand, where kinship is  reckoned in the male line, it is frequently not only legitimate but  necessary to conclude that it has succeeded a system of female kinship.  But this clearly does not mean that female descent has in _all_ cases  preceded the reckoning of kinship through males. Patrilineal descent may  have been directly evolved without the intermediate stage of reckoning  through females.    The problem is probably insoluble. No decisive data are available, for  the mere absence of traces of matrilineal descent does not necessarily  prove more than that it had long been superseded by reckoning of kinship  through males. All that can be said is that in the kinship organisations  known to us female descent seems to have prevailed in the vast majority  of cases and probably existed in the residual class of indeterminable  examples.    With patria potestas it is, of course, different. There can be little  doubt that it might and probably did develop in the absence of kinship  organisations and in a state of society where consanguinity is no real  bond after the children have reached puberty. If therefore under such  circumstances a kinship organisation were to come into existence, either  independently or by transmission, it might well be that patrilineal  principles prevailed from the first. But of such a case we have no  knowledge. It may perhaps be questioned whether the actually existing  peoples who appear to have no kinship organisations, such as the  Hottentots, the Bushmen, the Veddahs and perhaps the Fuegians, are not  in this state rather as a result of the break-up of their former  organisation than because they have never evolved kinship groups. But  our knowledge in these matters is lamentably small and the problem is  not one which calls for discussion here.    The second fundamental problem relating to rules of descent is that of  the cause of the transition from matrilineal to patrilineal descent. The  subject needs to be discussed in detail for each particular area before  general conclusions can be formulated; it is quite possible that the  causes will be found to differ widely; for no general rule can be laid  down as to the relations between matrilineal descent and other cultural  conditions.    All that can be attempted here is an examination of the various elements  in the problem so far as it affects Australia. To this may be prefixed a  further discussion of the origin of matrilineal descent with especial  reference to Australian conditions.    It is commonly assumed that in a pure matrilineal community, the husband  removes to the wife's local group (matrilocal marriage), or if not that,  that at any rate the authority in the family rests in the hands of the  mother's brothers, who are also the heirs to the exclusion of the  children. But of any such custom of removal there is but the very  slenderest evidence in Australia. According to Howitt it occurs  occasionally in Victoria and among the Dieri; among the Wakelbura it is  done only if a man elopes with a betrothed woman and the man to whom she  was betrothed dies; among the Kuinmurbura it seems to have been a  recognised thing for a man who married a woman of another tribe to  remove, but in this case he took no part in intertribal warfare[13]. In  all these cases, the Kurnai excepted, descent is reckoned in the female  line.    If however Dr Howitt's informant, who does not seem to have been  particularly accurate in many cases, is to be relied on, the removal of  the husband to the wife's group is also found among the patrilineal  Maryborough tribes, though only if the woman belonged to a distant  tribelet, whatever that may be[14]. To this information is added the  statement that in such cases the husband joined his wife's tribe for  purposes of hostilities also and that it has happened that a son has  come into conflict with his father under these circumstances and  endangered his life with full knowledge of what he was doing. There is,  it is true, no definite statement to the effect that children in these  tribes take their totems from the father, but we may assume that it is  the case. If therefore the statement in question is accurate, it is a  pretty clear proof of the break-up of the social system; for under no  circumstances does the totem-kinsman, as a rule, violate the  sacro-sanctity of his own flesh. It cannot"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17408"],[0,"The Florentine Painters of the Renaissance (#5)"],[1,"touch of mediaeval sentiment, no  note of transition. As artists they belonged entirely to the new era,  and they stand at the beginning of the Renaissance as types of two  tendencies which were to prevail in Florence throughout the whole of the  fifteenth century, partly supplementing and partly undoing the teaching  of Masaccio.    Uccello had a sense of tactile values and a feeling for colour, but in  so far as he used these gifts at all, it was to illustrate scientific  problems. His real passion was perspective, and painting was to him a  mere occasion for solving some problem in this science, and displaying  his mastery over its difficulties. Accordingly he composed pictures in  which he contrived to get as many lines as possible leading the eye  inward. Prostrate horses, dead or dying cavaliers, broken lances,  ploughed fields, Noah's arks, are used by him with scarcely an attempt  at disguise, to serve his scheme of mathematically converging lines. In  his zeal he forgot local colour--he loved to paint his horses green or  pink--forgot action, forgot composition, and, it need scarcely be added,  significance. Thus in his battle-pieces, instead of adequate action of  any sort, we get the feeling of witnessing a show of stuffed figures  whose mechanical movements have been suddenly arrested by some clog in  their wires; in his fresco of the \"Deluge,\" he has so covered his space  with demonstrations of his cleverness in perspective and foreshortening  that, far from bringing home to us the terrors of a cataclysm, he at the  utmost suggests the bursting of a mill-dam; and in the neighbouring  fresco of the \"Sacrifice of Noah,\" just as some capitally constructed  figures are about to enable us to realise the scene, all possibility of  artistic pleasure is destroyed by our seeing an object in the air which,  after some difficulty, we decipher as a human being plunging downward  from the clouds. Instead of making this figure, which, by the way, is  meant to represent God the Father, plunge toward us, Uccello  deliberately preferred to make it dash inward, away from us, thereby  displaying his great skill in both perspective and foreshortening, but  at the same time writing himself down as the founder of two families of  painters which have flourished ever since, the artists for dexterity's  sake--mental or manual, it scarcely matters--and the naturalists. As  these two clans increased rapidly in Florence, and, for both good and  evil, greatly affected the whole subsequent course of Florentine  painting, we must, before going farther, briefly define to ourselves  dexterity and naturalism, and their relation to art.    [Page heading: ART FOR DEXTERITY'S SAKE]    The essential in painting, especially in figure-painting, is, we agreed,  the rendering of the tactile values of the forms represented, because by  this means, and this alone, can the art make us realise forms better  than we do in life. The great painter, then, is, above all, an artist  with a great sense of tactile values and great skill in rendering them.  Now this sense, though it will increase as the man is revealed to  himself, is something which the great painter possesses at the start, so  that he is scarcely, if at all, aware of possessing it. His conscious  effort is given to the means of rendering. It is of means of rendering,  therefore, that he talks to others; and, because his triumphs here are  hard-earned and conscious, it is on his skill in rendering that he  prides himself. The greater the painter, the less likely he is to be  aware of aught else in his art than problems of rendering--but all the  while he is communicating what the force of his genius makes him feel  without his striving for it, almost without his being aware of it, the  material and spiritual significance of forms. However--his intimates  hear him talk of nothing but skill; he seems to think of nothing but  skill; and naturally they, and the entire public, conclude that his  skill is his genius, and that skill _is_ art. This, alas, has at all  times been the too prevalent notion of what art is, divergence of  opinion existing not on the principle, but on the kind of dexterity to  be prized, each generation, each critic, having an individual standard,  based always on the several peculiar problems and difficulties that  interest them. At Florence these inverted notions about art were  especially prevalent because it was a school of art with a score of men  of genius and a thousand mediocrities all egging each other on to  exhibitions of dexterity, and in their hot rivalry it was all the great  geniuses could do to be faithful to their sense of significance. Even  Masaccio was driven to exhibit his mere skill, the much admired and by  itself wonderfully realised figure of a naked man trembling with cold  being not only without real significance, but positively distracting,  in the representation of a baptism. A weaker man like Paolo Uccello  almost entirely sacrificed what sense of artistic significance he may  have started with, in his eagerness to display his skill and knowledge.  As for the rabble, their work has now the interest of prize exhibitions  at local art schools, and their number merely helped to accelerate the  momentum with which Florentine art rushed to its end. But out of even  mere dexterity a certain benefit to art may come. Men without feeling  for the significant may yet perfect a thousand matters which make  rendering easier and quicker for the man who comes with something to  render, and when Botticelli and Leonardo and Michelangelo appeared, they  found their artistic patrimony increased in spite of the fact that since  Masaccio there had been no man at all approaching their genius. This  increase, however, was due not at all so much to the sons of dexterity,  as to the intellectually much nobler, but artistically even inferior  race of whom also Uccello was the ancestor--the Naturalists.    [Page heading: NATURALISM IN ART]    What is a Naturalist? I venture upon the following definition:--A man  with a native gift for science who has taken to art. His purpose is not  to extract the material and spiritual significance of objects, thus  communicating them to us more rapidly and intensely than we should  perceive them ourselves, and thereby giving us a sense of heightened  vitality; his purpose is research, and his communication consists of  nothing but facts. From this perhaps too abstract statement let us take  refuge in an example already touched upon--the figure of the Almighty in  Uccello's \"Sacrifice of Noah.\" Instead of presenting this figure as  coming toward us in an attitude and with an expression that will appeal  to our sense of solemnity, as a man whose chief interest was artistic  would have done--as Giotto, in fact, did in his \"Baptism\"--Uccello seems  to have been possessed with nothing but the scientific intention to find  out how a man swooping down head-foremost would have looked if at a  given instant of his fall he had been suddenly congealed and suspended  in space. A figure like this may have a mathematical but certainly has  no psychological significance. Uccello, it is true, has studied every  detail of this phenomenon and noted down his observations, but because  his notes happen to be in form and colour, they do not therefore  constitute a work of art. Wherein does his achievement differ in quality  from a coloured map of a country? We can easily conceive of a relief map  of Cadore or Giverny on so large a scale, and so elaborately coloured,  that it will be an exact reproduction of the physical aspects of those  regions, but never for a moment should we place it beside a landscape by  Titian or Monet, and think of it as a work of art. Yet its relation to  the Titian or Monet painting is exactly that of Uccello's achievement to  Giotto's. What the scientist who paints--the naturalist, that is to  say,--attempts to do is not to give us what art alone can give us, the  life-enhancing qualities of objects, but a reproduction of them as they  are. If he succeeded, he would give us the exact visual impression of  the objects themselves, but art, as we have already agreed, must give us  not the mere reproductions of things but a quickened sense of capacity  for realising them. Artistically, then, the naturalists, Uccello and  his numerous successors, accomplished nothing. Yet their efforts to  reproduce objects as they are, their studies in anatomy and perspective,  made it inevitable that when another great genius did arise, he should  be a Leonardo or a Michelangelo, and not a Giotto.    [Page heading: ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO]    Uccello, as I have said, was the first representative of two strong  tendencies in Florentine painting--of art for dexterity's sake, and art  for scientific purposes. Andrea del Castagno, while also unable to  resist the fascination of mere science and dexterity, had too much  artistic genius to succumb to either. He was endowed with great sense  for the significant, although, it is true, not enough to save him  completely from the pitfalls which beset all Florentines, and even less  from one more peculiar to himself--the tendency to communicate at any  cost a feeling of power. To make us feel power as Masaccio and  Michelangelo do at their best is indeed an achievement, but it requires  the highest genius and the profoundest sense for the significant. The  moment this sense is at all lacking, the artist will not succeed in  conveying power, but such obvious manifestations of it as mere  strength, or, worse still, the insolence not infrequently accompanying  high spirits. Now Castagno, who succeeds well enough in one or two such  single figures as his Cumaean Sibyl or his Farinata degli Uberti, which  have great, if not the greatest, power, dignity, and even beauty,  elsewhere condescends to mere swagger,--as in his Pipo Spano or Niccolo  di Tolentino--or to mere strength, as in his \"Last Supper,\""]]]
