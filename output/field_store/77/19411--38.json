Observe how in this Day also, all these  people have occupied themselves with such foolish absurdities. For over a  thousand years they have been reciting this verse, and unwittingly  pronouncing their censure against the Jews, utterly unaware that they  themselves, openly and privily, are voicing the sentiments and belief of  the Jewish people! Thou art surely aware of their idle contention, that  all Revelation is ended, that the portals of Divine mercy are closed, that  from the day springs of eternal holiness no Sun shall rise again, that the  Ocean of everlasting bounty is forever stilled, and that out of the  Tabernacle of ancient glory the Messengers of God have ceased to be made  manifest. Such is the measure of the understanding of these small-minded,  contemptible people. These people have imagined that the flow of God's  all-encompassing grace and plenteous mercies, the cessation of which no  mind can contemplate, has been halted. From every side they have risen and  girded up the loins of tyranny, and exerted the utmost endeavor to quench  with the bitter waters of their vain fancy the flame of God's Burning  Bush, oblivious that the globe of power shall, within its own mighty  stronghold, protect the Lamp of God....    Behold how the sovereignty of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, is today  apparent and manifest amongst the people. You are well aware of what  befell His Faith in the early days of His Dispensation. What woeful  sufferings did the hand of the infidel and erring, the divines of that age  and their associates, inflict upon that spiritual Essence, that most pure  and holy Being! How abundant the thorns and briars which they have strewn  over His path! It is evident that that wretched generation, in their  wicked and satanic fancy, regarded every injury to that immortal Being as  a means to the attainment of an abiding felicity; inasmuch as the  recognized divines of that age, such as 'Abdu'llah-i-Ubayy, Abu'Amir, the  hermit, Ka'b-ibn-i-A_sh_raf, and Nadr-ibn-i-Hari_th_, all treated Him as  an impostor, and pronounced Him a lunatic and a calumniator. Such sore  accusations they brought against Him that in recounting them God  forbiddeth the ink to flow, Our pen to move, or the page to bear them.  These malicious imputations provoked the people to arise and torment Him.  And how fierce that torment, if the divines of the age be its chief  instigators, if they denounce Him to their followers, cast Him out from  their midst, and declare Him a miscreant! Hath not the same befallen this  Servant, and been witnessed by all?    For this reason did Muhammad cry out: \"No Prophet of God hath suffered  such harm as I have suffered.\" And in the Qur'an are recorded all the  calumnies and reproaches uttered against Him, as well as all the  afflictions which He suffered. Refer ye thereunto, that haply ye may be  informed of that which hath befallen His Revelation. So grievous was His  plight, that for a time all ceased to hold intercourse with Him and His  companions. Whoever associated with Him fell a victim to the relentless  cruelty of His enemies....    Consider, how great is the change today! Behold, how many are the  Sovereigns who bow the knee before His name! How numerous the nations and  kingdoms who have sought the shelter of His shadow, who bear allegiance to  His Faith, and pride themselves therein! From the pulpit-top there  ascendeth today the words of praise which, in utter lowliness, glorify His  blessed name; and from the heights of minarets there resoundeth the call  that summoneth the concourse of His people to adore Him. Even those Kings  of the earth who have refused to embrace His Faith and to put off the  garment of unbelief, none-the-less confess and acknowledge the greatness  and overpowering majesty of that Day Star of loving-kindness. Such is His  earthly sovereignty, the evidences of which thou dost on every side  behold. This sovereignty must needs be revealed and established either in  the lifetime of every Manifestation of God or after His ascension unto His  true habitation in the realms above....    It is evident that the changes brought about in every Dispensation  constitute the dark clouds that intervene between the eye of man's  understanding and the Divine Luminary which shineth forth from the day  spring of the Divine Essence. Consider how men for generations have been  blindly imitating their fathers, and have been trained according to such  ways and manners as have been laid down by the dictates of their Faith.  Were these men, therefore, to discover suddenly that a Man, Who hath been  living in their midst, Who, with respect to every human limitation hath  been their equal, had risen to abolish every established principle imposed  by their Faith--principles by which for centuries they have been  disciplined, and every opposer and denier of which they have come to  regard as infidel, profligate and wicked,--they would of a certainty be  veiled and hindered from acknowledging His truth. Such things are as  \"clouds\" that veil the eyes of those whose inner being hath not tasted the  Salsabil of detachment, nor drunk from the Kaw_th_ar of the knowledge of  God. Such men, when acquainted with those circumstances, become so veiled  that, without the least question, they pronounce the Manifestation of God  as infidel, and sentence Him to death. You must have heard of such things  taking place all down the ages, and are now observing them in these days.    It behoveth us, therefore, to make the utmost endeavor, that, by God's  invisible assistance, these dark veils, these clouds of Heaven-sent  trials, may not hinder us from beholding the beauty of His shining  Countenance, and that we may recognize Him only by His own Self.            XIV: THE DIVINE SPRINGTIME IS COME, O MOST EXALTED...      The Divine Springtime is come, O Most Exalted Pen, for the Festival of the  All-Merciful is fast approaching. Bestir thyself, and magnify, before the  entire creation, the name of God, and celebrate His praise, in such wise  that all created things may be regenerated and made new. Speak, and hold  not thy peace. The day star of blissfulness shineth above the horizon of  Our name, the Blissful, inasmuch as the kingdom of the name of God hath  been adorned with the ornament of the name of thy Lord, the Creator of the  heavens. Arise before the nations of the earth, and arm thyself with the  power of this Most Great Name, and be not of those who tarry.    Methinks that thou hast halted and movest not upon My Tablet. Could the  brightness of the Divine Countenance have bewildered thee, or the idle  talk of the froward filled thee with grief and paralyzed thy movement?  Take heed lest anything deter thee from extolling the greatness of this  Day--the Day whereon the Finger of majesty and power hath opened the seal  of the Wine of Reunion, and called all who are in the heavens and all who  are on the earth. Preferrest thou to tarry when the breeze announcing the  Day of God hath already breathed over thee, or art thou of them that are  shut out as by a veil from Him?    No veil whatever have I allowed, O Lord of all names and Creator of the  heavens, to shut me from the recognition of the glories of Thy Day--the Day  which is the lamp of guidance unto the whole world, and the sign of the  Ancient of Days unto all them that dwell therein. My silence is by reason  of the veils that have blinded Thy creatures' eyes to Thee, and my  muteness is because of the impediments that have hindered Thy people from  recognizing Thy truth. Thou knowest what is in me, but I know not what is  in Thee. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By Thy name that  excelleth all other names! If Thy overruling and all-compelling behest  should ever reach me, it would empower me to revive the souls of all men,  through Thy most exalted Word, which I have heard uttered by Thy Tongue of  power in Thy Kingdom of glory. It would enable me to announce the  revelation of Thy effulgent countenance wherethrough that which lay hidden  from the eyes of men hath been manifested in Thy name, the Perspicuous,  the sovereign Protector, the Self-Subsisting.    Canst thou discover any one but Me, O Pen, in this Day? What hath become  of the creation and the manifestations thereof? What of the names and  their kingdom? Whither are gone all created things, whether seen or  unseen? What of the hidden secrets of the universe and its revelations?  Lo, the entire creation hath passed away! Nothing remaineth except My  Face, the Ever-Abiding, the Resplendent, the All-Glorious.    This is the Day whereon naught can be seen except the splendors of the  Light that shineth from the face of Thy Lord, the Gracious, the Most  Bountiful. Verily, We have caused every soul to expire by virtue of Our  irresistible and all-subduing sovereignty. We have, then, called into  being a new creation, as a token of Our grace unto men. I am, verily, the  All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.    This is the Day whereon the unseen world crieth out: \"Great is thy  blessedness, O earth, for thou hast been made the foot-stool of thy God,  and been chosen as the seat of His mighty throne.\" The realm of glory  exclaimeth: \"Would that my life could be sacrificed for thee, for He Who  is the Beloved of the All-Merciful hath established His sovereignty upon  thee, through the power of His Name that hath been promised unto all  things, whether of the past or of the future.\" This is the Day whereon  every sweet smelling thing hath derived its fragrance from the smell of My  garment--a garment that hath shed its perfume upon the whole of creation.  This is the Day whereon the rushing waters of everlasting life have gushed  out of the Will of the All-Merciful. Haste ye, with your hearts and souls,  and quaff your fill, O Concourse of the realms above!    Say: He it is Who "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16941"],[0,"The Hidden Words of Bahá'u'lláh (#5)"],[1,"one eye and open the other. Close one to the  world and all that is therein, and open the other to the hallowed beauty  of the Beloved.        \"13: O MY CHILDREN! I fear lest, bereft of the melody of the dove of...\"      O MY CHILDREN! I fear lest, bereft of the melody of the dove of heaven, ye  will sink back to the shades of utter loss, and, never having gazed upon  the beauty of the rose, return to water and clay.        \"14: O FRIENDS! Abandon not the everlasting beauty for a beauty...\"      O FRIENDS! Abandon not the everlasting beauty for a beauty that must die,  and set not your affections on this mortal world of dust.        \"15: O SON OF SPIRIT! The time cometh, when the nightingale of  holiness...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! The time cometh, when the nightingale of holiness will no  longer unfold the inner mysteries and ye will all be bereft of the  celestial melody and of the voice from on high.        \"16: O ESSENCE OF NEGLIGENCE! Myriads of mystic tongues find utterance in  one...\"      O ESSENCE OF NEGLIGENCE! Myriads of mystic tongues find utterance in one  speech, and myriads of hidden mysteries are revealed in a single melody;  yet, alas, there is no ear to hear, nor heart to understand.        \"17: O COMRADES! The gates that open on the Placeless stand wide...\"      O COMRADES! The gates that open on the Placeless stand wide and the  habitation of the loved one is adorned with the lovers' blood, yet all but  a few remain bereft of this celestial city, and even of these few, none  but the smallest handful hath been found with a pure heart and sanctified  spirit.        \"18: O YE DWELLERS IN THE HIGHEST PARADISE!...\"      O YE DWELLERS IN THE HIGHEST PARADISE! Proclaim unto the children of  assurance that within the realms of holiness, nigh unto the celestial  paradise, a new garden hath appeared, round which circle the denizens of  the realm on high and the immortal dwellers of the exalted paradise.  Strive, then, that ye may attain that station, that ye may unravel the  mysteries of love from its wind-flowers and learn the secret of divine and  consummate wisdom from its eternal fruits. Solaced are the eyes of them  that enter and abide therein!        \"19: O MY FRIENDS! Have ye forgotten that true and radiant morn,...\"      O MY FRIENDS! Have ye forgotten that true and radiant morn, when in those  hallowed and blessed surroundings ye were all gathered in My presence  beneath the shade of the tree of life, which is planted in the  all-glorious paradise? Awe-struck ye listened as I gave utterance to these  three most holy words: O friends! Prefer not your will to Mine, never  desire that which I have not desired for you, and approach Me not with  lifeless hearts, defiled with worldly desires and cravings. Would ye but  sanctify your souls, ye would at this present hour recall that place and  those surroundings, and the truth of My utterance should be made evident  unto all of you.        \"20: O YE THAT ARE LYING AS DEAD ON THE COUCH OF HEEDLESSNESS!...\"      In the eighth of the most holy lines, in the fifth Tablet of Paradise, He  saith: O YE THAT ARE LYING AS DEAD ON THE COUCH OF HEEDLESSNESS! Ages have  passed and your precious lives are well-nigh ended, yet not a single  breath of purity hath reached Our court of holiness from you. Though  immersed in the ocean of misbelief, yet with your lips ye profess the one  true faith of God. Him whom I abhor ye have loved, and of My foe ye have  made a friend. Notwithstanding, ye walk on My earth complacent and  self-satisfied, heedless that My earth is weary of you and everything  within it shunneth you. Were ye but to open your eyes, ye would, in truth,  prefer a myriad griefs unto this joy, and would count death itself better  than this life.        \"21: O MOVING FORM OF DUST! I desire communion with thee, but thou  wouldst...\"      O MOVING FORM OF DUST! I desire communion with thee, but thou wouldst put  no trust in Me. The sword of thy rebellion hath felled the tree of thy  hope. At all times I am near unto thee, but thou art ever far from Me.  Imperishable glory I have chosen for thee, yet boundless shame thou hast  chosen for thyself. While there is yet time, return, and lose not thy  chance.        \"22: O SON OF DESIRE! The learned and the wise have for long years...\"      O SON OF DESIRE! The learned and the wise have for long years striven and  failed to attain the presence of the All-Glorious; they have spent their  lives in search of Him, yet did not behold the beauty of His countenance.  Thou without the least effort didst attain thy goal, and without search  hast obtained the object of thy quest. Yet, notwithstanding, thou didst  remain so wrapt in the veil of self, that thine eyes beheld not the beauty  of the Beloved, nor did thy hand touch the hem of His robe. Ye that have  eyes, behold and wonder.        \"23: O DWELLERS IN THE CITY OF LOVE! Mortal blasts have beset the  everlasting candle,...\"      O DWELLERS IN THE CITY OF LOVE! Mortal blasts have beset the everlasting  candle, and the beauty of the celestial Youth is veiled in the darkness of  dust. The chief of the monarchs of love is wronged by the people of  tyranny and the dove of holiness lies prisoned in the talons of owls. The  dwellers in the pavilion of glory and the celestial concourse bewail and  lament, while ye repose in the realm of negligence, and esteem yourselves  as of the true friends. How vain are your imaginings!        \"24: O YE THAT ARE FOOLISH, YET HAVE A NAME TO BE WISE!...\"      O YE THAT ARE FOOLISH, YET HAVE A NAME TO BE WISE! Wherefore do ye wear  the guise of shepherds, when inwardly ye have become wolves, intent upon  My flock? Ye are even as the star, which riseth ere the dawn, and which,  though it seem radiant and luminous, leadeth the wayfarers of My city  astray into the paths of perdition.        \"25: O YE SEEMING FAIR YET INWARDLY FOUL! Ye are like clear but bitter  water, which to outward...\"      O YE SEEMING FAIR YET INWARDLY FOUL! Ye are like clear but bitter water,  which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by the  divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea, the sun beam falls alike upon  the dust and the mirror, yet differ they in reflection even as doth the  star from the earth: nay, immeasurable is the difference!        \"26: O MY FRIEND IN WORD! Ponder awhile. Hast thou ever heard that  friend...\"      O MY FRIEND IN WORD! Ponder awhile. Hast thou ever heard that friend and  foe should abide in one heart? Cast out then the stranger, that the Friend  may enter His home.        \"27: O SON OF DUST! All that is in heaven and earth I have ordained...\"      O SON OF DUST! All that is in heaven and earth I have ordained for thee,  except the human heart, which I have made the habitation of My beauty and  glory; yet thou didst give My home and dwelling to another than Me; and  whenever the manifestation of My holiness sought His own abode, a stranger  found He there, and, homeless, hastened unto the sanctuary of the Beloved.  Notwithstanding I have concealed thy secret and desired not thy shame.        \"28: O ESSENCE OF DESIRE! At many a dawn have I turned from the realms  of...\"      O ESSENCE OF DESIRE! At many a dawn have I turned from the realms of the  Placeless unto thine abode, and found thee on the bed of ease busied with  others than Myself. Thereupon, even as the flash of the spirit, I returned  to the realms of celestial glory and breathed it not in My retreats above  unto the hosts of holiness.        \"29: O SON OF BOUNTY! Out of the wastes of nothingness, with the clay...\"      O SON OF BOUNTY! Out of the wastes of nothingness, with the clay of My  command I made thee to appear, and have ordained for thy training every  atom in existence and the essence of all created things. Thus, ere thou  didst issue from thy mother's womb, I destined for thee two founts of  gleaming milk, eyes to watch over thee, and hearts to love thee. Out of My  loving-kindness, 'neath the shade of My mercy I nurtured thee, and guarded  thee by the essence of My grace and favor. And My purpose in all this was  that thou mightest attain My everlasting dominion and become worthy of My  invisible bestowals. And yet heedless thou didst remain, and when fully  grown, thou didst neglect all My bounties and occupied thyself with thine  idle imaginings, in such wise that thou didst become wholly forgetful,  and, turning away from the portals of the Friend didst abide within the  courts of My enemy.        \"30: O BOND SLAVE OF THE WORLD! Many a dawn hath the breeze of My  loving-kindness...\"      O BOND SLAVE OF THE WORLD! Many a dawn hath the breeze of My  loving-kindness wafted over thee and found thee upon the bed of  heedlessness fast asleep. Bewailing then thy plight it returned whence it  came.        \"31: O SON OF EARTH! Wouldst thou have Me, seek none other than...\"      O SON OF EARTH! Wouldst thou have Me, seek none other than Me; and wouldst  thou gaze upon My beauty, close thine eyes to the world and all that is  therein; for My will and the will of another than Me, even as fire and  water, cannot dwell together in one heart.        \"32: O BEFRIENDED STRANGER! The candle of thine heart is lighted by the  hand...\"      O BEFRIENDED STRANGER! The candle of thine heart is lighted by the hand of  My power, quench it not with the contrary winds of self and passion. The  healer of all thine ills is remembrance of Me, forget it not. Make My love  thy treasure and cherish it even as thy very sight and life.        \"33: O MY BROTHER! Hearken to the delightsome words of My honeyed...\"      O MY BROTHER! Hearken to the delightsome words of My honeyed tongue, and  quaff the stream of mystic holiness from My sugar-shedding lips. Sow the  seeds of My divine wisdom in the pure soil of thy heart, and water them  with the water of certitude, that the hyacinths of My knowledge and wisdom  may spring up fresh and green in the sacred city of"]]]
