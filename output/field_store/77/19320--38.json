Ours, yours, hers, theirs, are used when the substantive preceding is      separated by a verb, as These are our books. These books are ours. Your      children excel ours in stature, but ours surpass yours in learning.        Ours, yours, hers, theirs, notwithstanding their seeming plural      termination, are applied equally to singular and plural substantives,      as, This book is ours. These books are ours.        Mine and thine were formerly used before a vowel, as mine amiable lady:      which though now disused in prose, might be still properly continued in      poetry: they are used as ours and yours, when they are referred to a      substantive preceding, as thy house is larger than mine, but my garden      is more spacious than thine.    Their and theirs are the possessives likewise of they, when they is the  plural of it, and are therefore applied to things.    Pronouns relative are, who, which, what, whether, whosoever, whatsoever.    Nom.                     Who.    Gen.                     Whose.    Other oblique cases.     Whom.    Nom.                     Which.    Gen.                     Of which, or whose.    Other oblique cases.     Which.        Who is now used in relation to persons, and which in relation to      things; but they were anciently confounded. At least it was common to      say, the man which, though I remember no example of the thing who.        Whose is rather the poetical than regular genitive of which.                      The fruit    Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste    Brought death into the world.       Milton.    Whether is only used in the nominative and accusative cases; and has no  plural, being applied only to one of a number, commonly to one of two, as  Whether of these is left I know not. Whether shall I choose? It is now  almost obsolete.    What, whether relative or interrogative, is without variation.    Whosoever, whatsoever, being compounded of who or what, and soever, follow  the rule of their primitives.                     Singular.   Plural.                     This        These    In all cases.    That        Those.                     Other,      Others.                     Whether.        The plural others is not used but when it is referred to a substantive      preceding, as I have sent other horses. I have not sent the same      horses, but others.    Another, being only an other, has no plural.    Here, there, and where, joined with certain particles, have a relative and  pronominal use. Hereof, herein, hereby, hereafter, herewith, thereof,  therein, thereby, thereupon, therewith, whereof, wherein, whereby,  whereupon, wherewith, which signify, of this, in this, &c. of that, in  that, &c. of which, in which, &c.    Therefore and wherefore, which are properly there for and where for, for  that, for which, are now reckoned conjunctions, and continued in use. The  rest seem to be passing by degrees into neglect, though proper, useful, and  analogous. They are referred both to singular and plural antecedents.    There are two more words used only in conjunction with pronouns, own and  self.    Own is added to possessives, both singular and plural, as my own hand, our  own house. It is emphatical, and implies a silent contrariety, or  opposition; as, I live in my own house, that is, not in a hired house. This  I did with my own hand, that is, without help or not by proxy.    Self is added to possessives, as myself, yourselves; and sometimes to  personal pronouns, as himself, itself, themselves. It then, like own,  expresses emphasis and opposition, as I did this myself, that is, not  another; or it forms a reciprocal pronoun, as We hurt ourselves by vain  rage.        Himself, itself, themselves, are supposed by Wallis to be put by      corruption, for his self, it self, their selves; so that self is always      a substantive. This seems justly observed, for we say, He came himself;      Himself shall do this; where himself cannot be an accusative.           *       *       *       *       *    Of the VERB.    English verbs are active, as I love; or neuter, as I languish. The neuters  are formed like the actives.        Most verbs signifying action may likewise signify condition or habit,      and become neuters; as I love, I am in love; I strike, I am now      striking.    Verbs have only two tenses inflected in their terminations, the present,  and simple preterit; the other tenses are compounded of the auxiliary  verbs, have, shall, will, let, may, can, and the infinitive of the active  or neuter verb.    The passive voice is formed by joining the participle preterit to the  substantive verb, as I am loved.    To have. Indicative Mood.    Present Tense.      Sing. I have, thou hast, he hath or has,    Plur. We have, ye have, they have.        Has is a termination connoted from hath, but now more frequently used      both in verse and prose.    Simple Preterit.      Sing. I had, thou hadst, he had    Plur. We had, ye had, they had.    Compound Preterit.      Sing. I have had, thou hast had, he has or hath had;    Plur. We have had, ye have had, they have had.    Preterpluperfect.      Sing. I had had, thou hadst had, he had had.    Plur. We had had, ye had had, they had had.    Future.      Sing. I shall have, thou shalt have, he shall have;    Plur. We shall have, ye shall have, they shall have.    Second Future.      Sing. I will have, thou wilt have, he will have;    Plur. We will have, ye wilt have, they will have.        By reading these future tenses may be observed the variations of shall      and will.    Imperative Mood.      Sing. Have, or have thou, let him have;    Plur. Let us have, have or have ye, let them have.    Conjunctive Mood.    Present.      Sing. I have, thou have, he have;    Plur. We have, ye have, they have.    Preterit simple as in the Indicative.    Preterit compound.      Sing. I have had, thou have had, he have had;    Plur. We have had, ye have had, they have had.    Future.      Sing. I shall have, as in the Indicative.    Second Future.      Sing. I shall have had, thou shalt have had, he shall have had;    Plur. We shall have had, ye shall have had, they shall have had.    Potential.    The potential form of speaking is expressed by may, can, in the present;  and might, could, or should, in the preterit, joined with the infinitive  mood of the verb.    Present.      Sing. I may have, thou mayst have, he may have;    Plur. We may have, ye may have, they may have.    Preterit.      Sing. I might have, thou mightst have, he might have;    Plur. We might have, ye might have, they might have.    Present.      Sing. I can have, thou canst have, he can have;    Plur. We can have, ye can have, they can have.    Preterit.      Sing. I could have, thou couldst have, he could have;    Plur. We could have, ye could have, they could have.    In like manner should is united to the verb.    There is likewise a double Preterit.      Sing. I should have had, thou shouldst have had, he should have had;    Plur. We should have had, ye should have had, they should have had.    In like manner we use, I might have had; I could have had, &c.    Infinitive Mood.      Present. To have.    Preterit. To have had.    Participle present. Having.    Participle preterit. Had.

I will love, &c.    Imperative.      Sing. Love or love thou, let him love;    Plur. Let us love, love or love ye, let them love.    Conjunctive. Present.      Sing. I love, thou love, he love;    Plur. We love, ye love, they love.    Preterit simple, as in the indicative.    Preterit compound. I have loved, &c.    Future. I shall love, &c.    Second Future. I shall have loved, &c.    Potential.      Present. I may or can love, &c.    Preterit. I might, could, or should love, &c.    Double Preterit. I might, could, or should have    loved, &c.    Infinitive.      Present. To love.    Preterit. To have loved.    Participle present. Loving.    Participle past. Loved.    The passive is formed by the addition of the participle preterit to the  different tenses of the verb to be, which must therefore be here exhibited.    Indicative. Present.      Sing. I am, thou art, he is;    Plur. We are or be, ye are or be, they are or be.            The plural be is now little in use.    Preterit.      Sing. I was, thou wast or wert, he was;    Plur. We were, ye were, they were.    Wert is properly of the conjunctive mood, and ought not to be used in the  indicative.      Preterit compound. I have been, &c.    Preterpluperfect. I had been, &c.    Future. I shall or will be, &c.    Imperative.      Sing. Be thou; let him be;    Plur. Let us be; be ye; let them be.    Conjunctive. Present.      Sing. I be, thou beest, he be;    Plur.

Potential.      I may or can; would, could, or should be; could,    would, or should have been, &c.    Infinitive.      Present. To be.    Preterit. To have been.    Participle present. Being.    Participle preterit. Having been.    Passive Voice. Indicative Mood.      I am loved, &c. I was loved, &c. I have been    loved, &c.    Conjunctive Mood.      If I be loved, &c. If I were loved, &c. If I shall    have been loved, &c.    Potential Mood.      I may or can be loved, &c. I might, could, or    should be loved, &c.

If we  might derive from, or to inhabit, the etymological distinction would be  complete on these principles. An island being one distinct habitation of  men; and a continent land continued from one state to another. The former  derivation might be rendered specious by remarking how singularly Homer  and others use with, as if they had a natural connection. See II. B.  626. and, Sophoc. Ajax. 601.]    [**** In or near the latitude of 30 deg. South, New Holland extends full 40  degrees of longitude, which, under that parallel, may be estimated at 60  English miles to a degree. The extent from York Cape to South Cape is full  33 degrees of latitude, which are calculated of course at 691/2 English  miles each.]    To New South Wales England has the claim which a tacit consent has  generally made decisive among the European States, that of prior  discovery. The whole of that Eastern coast, except the very Southern  point, having been untouched by any navigator, till it was explored by  Captain Cook. This consideration, added to the more favourable accounts  given of this side of the continent than of the other, was sufficient to  decide the choice of the British government, in appointing a place for  the banishment of a certain class of criminals.    The cause of the determination to send out in this manner the convicts  under sentence of transportation, was, as is well known, the necessary  cessation of their removal to America; and the inconveniences experienced  in the other modes of destination adopted after that period.    Virginia, greatly in want, at its first settlement, of labourers to clear  away the impenetrable forests which impeded all cultivation, was willing,  from very early times, to receive as servants, those English criminals  whom our Courts of Law deemed not sufficiently guilty for capital  punishment.* The planters hired their services during a limited term; and  they were latterly sent out under the care of contractors, who were  obliged to prove, by certificates, that they had disposed of them,  according to the intention of the law.    [* Banishment was first ordered as a punishment for rogues and vagrants,  by statute 39 Eliz. ch. 4. See Blackst. Com. IV. chap. 31. But no place  was there specified. The practice of transporting criminals to America is  said to have commenced in the reign of James I; the year 1619 being the  memorable epoch of its origin: but that destination is first expressly  mentioned in 18 Car. II. ch. 2.--The transport traffic was first  regulated by statute 4 George I. ch. II. and the causes expressed in the  preamble to be, the failure of those who undertook to transport  themselves, and the great want of servants in his Majesty's plantations.  Subsequent Acts enforced further regulations.]    The benefits of this regulation were various. The colonies received by  it, at an easy rate, an assistance very necessary; and the mother country  was relieved from the burthen of subjects, who at home were not only  useless but pernicious: besides which, the mercantile returns, on this  account alone, are reported to have arisen, in latter times, to a very  considerable amount.* The individuals themselves, doubtless, in some  instances, proved incorrigible; but it happened also, not very  unfrequently, that, during the period of their legal servitude, they  became reconciled to a life of honest industry, were altogether reformed  in their manners, and rising gradually by laudable efforts, to situations  of advantage, independence, and estimation, contributed honourably to the  population and prosperity of their new country.**    [* It is said, forty thousand pounds per annum, about two thousand  convicts being sold for twenty pounds each.]    [** The Abbe Raynal has given his full testimony to the policy of this  species of banishment, in the fourteenth Book of his History, near the  beginning.]    By the contest in America, and the subsequent separation of the thirteen  Colonies, this traffic was of course destroyed. Other expedients, well  known to the public, have since been tried; some of which proved highly  objectionable;* and all have been found to want some of the principal  advantages experienced from the usual mode of transportation.--The  deliberations upon this subject, which more than once employed the  attention of Parliament, produced at length the plan of which this volume  displays the first result. On December 6, 1786, the proper orders were  issued by his Majesty in Council, and an Act establishing a Court of  Judicature in the place of settlement, and making such other regulations  as the occasion required, received the sanction of the whole legislature  early in the year 1787.    [* ¶ Particularly, the transporting of criminals to the coast of Africa,  where what was meant as an alleviation of punishment too frequently ended  in death.]    To expatiate upon the principles of penal law is foreign to the purpose  of this work, but thus much is evident to the plainest apprehension, that  the objects most to be desired in it are the restriction of the number of  capital inflictions, as far as is consistent with the security of  society; and the employment of every method that can be devised for  rendering the guilty persons serviceable to the public, and just to  themselves; for correcting their moral depravity, inducing habits of  industry, and arming them in future against the temptations by which they  have been once ensnared.    For effectuating these beneficial purposes, well regulated penitentiary  houses seem, in speculation, to afford the fairest opportunity; and a  plan of this kind, formed by the united efforts of Judge Blackstone, Mr.  Eden, and Mr. Howard, was adopted by Parliament in the year 1779.  Difficulties however occurred which prevented the execution of this  design: a circumstance which will be something the less regretted when it  shall be considered, that it is perhaps the fate of this theory, in  common with many others of a very pleasing nature, to be more attractive  in contemplation than efficacious in real practice. A perfect design,  carried on by imperfect agents, is liable to lose the chief part of its  excellence; and the best digested plan of confinement must in execution  be committed, chiefly, to men not much enlightened, very little armed  against corruption, and constantly exposed to the danger of it. The  vigilance which in the infancy of such institutions effectually watches  over the conduct of these public servants, will always in a little time  be relaxed; and it will readily be conceived that a large penitentiary  house, very corruptly governed, would be, of all associations, one of the  most pernicious to those confined, and most dangerous to the peace of  society.    In some countries, malefactors not capitally convicted, are sentenced to  the gallies or the mines; punishments often more cruel than death, and  here, on many accounts, impracticable. In other places they are employed  in public works, under the care of overseers. This method has been  partially tried in England on the Thames, but has been found by no means  to produce the benefits expected from it. There is, therefore, little  temptation to pursue it to a further extent. The employment of criminals  in works carried on under the public eye, is perhaps too repugnant to the  feelings of Englishmen ever to be tolerated. Reason, indeed, acquiesces  in the melancholy necessity of punishing, but chains and badges of  servitude are unpleasing objects, and compassion will always revolt at  the sight of actual infliction. Convicts so employed would either by an  ill placed charity be rewarded, or the people, undergoing a change of  character far from desirable, would in time grow callous to those  impressions which naturally impel them to give relief.    It remains therefore, that we adhere as much as possible to the practice  approved by long experience, of employing the services of such criminals  in remote and rising settlements. For this purpose the establishment on  the eastern coast of New Holland has been projected, and carried on with  every precaution to render it as beneficial as possible. That some  difficulties will arise in the commencement of such an undertaking must  be expected; but it is required by no moral obligation that convicts  should be conveyed to a place of perfect convenience and security; and  though the voluntary emigrants and honourable servants of the state, must  in some measure, be involved for a time in the same disadvantages, yet to  have resisted difficulties is often finally an advantage rather than an  evil; and there are probably few persons so circumstanced who will repine  at moderate hardships, when they reflect that by undergoing them they are  rendering an essential and an honourable service to their country.
