Immeasurably high  are the Prophets of God exalted above the comprehension of men, who can  never know them except by their own Selves. Far be it from His glory that  His chosen Ones should be magnified by any other than their own persons.  Glorified are they above the praise of men; exalted are they above human  understanding!    The term \"suns\" hath many a time been applied in the writings of the  \"immaculate Souls\" unto the Prophets of God, those luminous Emblems of  Detachment. Among those writings are the following words recorded in the  \"Prayer of Nudbih\":(23) \"Whither are gone the resplendent Suns? Whereunto  have departed those shining Moons and sparkling Stars?\" Thus, it hath  become evident that the terms \"sun,\" \"moon,\" and \"stars\" primarily signify  the Prophets of God, the saints, and their companions, those Luminaries,  the light of Whose knowledge hath shed illumination upon the worlds of the  visible and the invisible.    In another sense, by these terms is intended the divines of the former  Dispensation, who live in the days of the subsequent Revelations, and who  hold the reins of religion in their grasp. If these divines be illumined  by the light of the latter Revelation they will be acceptable unto God,  and will shine with a light everlasting. Otherwise, they will be declared  as darkened, even though to outward seeming they be leaders of men,  inasmuch as belief and unbelief, guidance and error, felicity and misery,  light and darkness, are all dependent upon the sanction of Him Who is the  Day-star of Truth. Whosoever among the divines of every age receiveth, in  the Day of Reckoning, the testimony of faith from the Source of true  knowledge, he verily becometh the recipient of learning, of divine favour,  and of the light of true understanding. Otherwise, he is branded as guilty  of folly, denial, blasphemy, and oppression.    It is evident and manifest unto every discerning observer that even as the  light of the star fadeth before the effulgent splendour of the sun, so  doth the luminary of earthly knowledge, of wisdom, and understanding  vanish into nothingness when brought face to face with the resplendent  glories of the Sun of Truth, the Day-star of divine enlightenment.    That the term \"sun\" hath been applied to the leaders of religion is due to  their lofty position, their fame, and renown. Such are the universally  recognized divines of every age, who speak with authority, and whose fame  is securely established. If they be in the likeness of the Sun of Truth,  they will surely be accounted as the most exalted of all luminaries;  otherwise, they are to be recognized as the focal centres of hellish fire.  Even as He saith: \"Verily, the sun and the moon are both condemned to the  torment of infernal fire.\"(24) You are no doubt familiar with the  interpretation of the term \"sun\" and \"moon\" mentioned in this verse; no  need therefore to refer unto it. And whosoever is of the element of this  \"sun\" and \"moon\", that is, followeth the example of these leaders in  setting his face towards falsehood and in turning away from the truth he  undoubtedly cometh out of infernal gloom and returneth thereunto.    And now, O seeker, it behooveth us firmly to cling unto the  Urvatu'l-Vuthqa, that perchance we may leave behind the darksome night of  error, and embrace the dawning light of divine guidance. Shall we not flee  from the face of denial, and seek the sheltering shadow of certitude?  Shall we not free ourselves from the horror of satanic gloom, and hasten  towards the rising light of the heavenly Beauty? In such wise, we bestow  upon you the fruit of the Tree of divine knowledge, that ye may gladly and  joyously abide in the Ridvan of divine wisdom.    In another sense, by the terms 'sun', 'moon', and 'stars' are meant such  laws and teachings as have been established and proclaimed in every  Dispensation, such as the laws of prayer and fasting. These have,  according to the law of the Qur'an, been regarded, when the beauty of the  Prophet Muhammad had passed beyond the veil, as the most fundamental and  binding laws of His dispensation. To this testify the texts of the  traditions and chronicles, which, on account of their being widely known,  need not be referred to here. Nay rather, in every Dispensation the law  concerning prayer hath been emphasized and universally enforced. To this  testify the recorded traditions ascribed to the lights that have emanated  from the Day-star of Truth, the essence of the Prophet Muhammad.    The traditions established the fact that in all Dispensations the law of  prayer hath constituted a fundamental element of the Revelation of all the  Prophets of God--a law the form and the manner of which hath been adapted  to the varying requirements of every age. Inasmuch as every subsequent  Revelation hath abolished the manners, habits, and teachings that have  been clearly, specifically, and firmly established by the former  Dispensation, these have accordingly been symbolically expressed in terms  of 'sun' and 'moon'. \"That He might prove you, which of you excel in  deeds.\"(25)    Moreover, in the traditions the terms \"sun\" and \"moon\" have been applied  to prayer and fasting, even as it is said: \"Fasting is illumination,  prayer is light.\" One day, a well-known divine came to visit Us. While We  were conversing with him, he referred to the above-quoted tradition. He  said: \"Inasmuch as fasting causeth the heat of the body to increase, it  hath therefore been likened unto the light of the sun; and as the prayer  of the night-season refresheth man, it hath been compared unto the  radiance of the moon.\" Thereupon We realized that that poor man had not  been favoured with a single drop of the ocean of true understanding, and  had strayed far from the burning Bush of divine wisdom. We then politely  observed to him saying: \"The interpretation your honour hath given to this  tradition is the one current amongst the people. Could it not be  interpreted differently?\" He asked Us: \"What could it be?\" We made reply:  \"Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, and the most distinguished of God's  chosen Ones, hath likened the Dispensation of the Qur'an unto heaven, by  reason of its loftiness, its paramount influence, its majesty, and the  fact that it comprehendeth all religions. And as the sun and moon  constitute the brightest and most prominent luminaries in the heavens,  similarly in the heaven of the religion of God two shining orbs have been  ordained--fasting and prayer. 'Islam is heaven; fasting is its sun, prayer,  its moon.'\"    This is the purpose underlying the symbolic words of the Manifestations of  God. Consequently, the application of the terms \"sun\" and \"moon\" to the  things already mentioned hath been demonstrated and justified by the text  of the sacred verses and the recorded traditions. Hence, it is clear and  manifest that by the words \"the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall  not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven\" is intended the  waywardness of the divines, and the annulment of laws firmly established  by divine Revelation, all of which, in symbolic language, have been  foreshadowed by the Manifestation of God. None except the righteous shall  partake of this cup, none but the godly can share therein. \"The righteous  shall drink of a cup tempered at the camphor fountain.\"(26)    It is unquestionable that in every succeeding Revelation the \"sun\" and  \"moon\" of the teachings, laws, commandments, and prohibitions which have  been established in the preceding Dispensation, and which have  overshadowed the people of that age, become darkened, that is, are  exhausted, and cease to exert their influence. Consider now, had the  people of the Gospel recognized the meaning of the symbolic terms \"sun\"  and \"moon,\" had they sought, unlike the froward and perverse,  enlightenment from Him Who is the Revealer of divine knowledge, they would  have surely comprehended the purpose of these terms, and would not have  become afflicted and oppressed by the darkness of their selfish desires.  Yea, but since they have failed to acquire true knowledge from its very  Source, they have perished in the perilous vale of waywardness and  misbelief. They still have not awakened to perceive that all the signs  foretold have been made manifest, that the promised Sun hath risen above  the horizon of divine Revelation, and that the \"sun\" and \"moon\" of the  teachings, the laws, and learning of a former Dispensation have darkened  and set.    And now, with fixed gaze and steady wings enter thou the way of certitude  and truth. \"Say: It is God; then leave them to entertain themselves with  their cavilings.\"(27) Thus, wilt thou be accounted of those companions of  whom He saith: \"They that say 'Our Lord is God,' and continue steadfast in  His way, upon them, verily, shall the angels descend.\"(28) Then shalt thou  witness all these mysteries with thine own eyes.    O my brother! Take thou the step of the spirit, so that, swift as the  twinkling of an eye, thou mayest flash through the wilds of remoteness and  bereavement, attain the Ridvan of everlasting reunion, and in one breath  commune with the heavenly Spirits. For with human feet thou canst never  hope to traverse these immeasurable distances, nor attain thy goal. Peace  be upon him whom the light of truth guideth unto all truth, and who, in  the name of God, standeth in the path of His Cause, upon the shore of true  understanding.    This is the meaning of the sacred verse: \"But nay! I swear by the Lord of  the Easts and the Wests,\"(29) inasmuch as the \"Suns\" referred to have each  their own particular rising and setting place. And as the commentators of  the Qur'an have failed to grasp the symbolic meaning of these \"Suns,\" they  therefore were at pains to interpret the above-quoted verse. Some of them  maintained that owing to the fact that the sun each day rises from a  different point, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16984"],[0,"Prayers and Meditations (#5)"],[1,"            XXII: \"EXALTED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I AM THE ONE...\"      Exalted art Thou, O Lord my God! I am the one who hath forsaken his all  and set his face towards the splendors of the glory of Thy countenance,  who hath severed every tie and clung to the cord of Thy love and of Thy  good-pleasure. I am he, O my God, who hath embraced Thy love and accepted  all the adversities which the world can inflict, who hath offered up  himself as a ransom for the sake of Thy loved ones, that they may ascend  into the heavens of Thy knowledge and be drawn nearer unto Thee, and may  soar in the atmosphere of Thy love and Thy good-pleasure.    Ordain, O my God, for me and for them that which Thou didst decree for  such of Thy chosen ones as are wholly devoted unto Thee. Cause them, then,  to be numbered among those whose eyes Thou hast cleansed and kept from  turning to any one save Thee, and whose eyes Thou hast protected from  beholding any face except Thy face.    Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the  Supreme King, the Help in Peril, the All-Pardoner, the Ever-Forgiving.            XXIII: \"GLORIFIED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I IMPLORE...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I implore Thee by the onrushing winds  of Thy grace, and by them Who are the Day-Springs of Thy purpose and the  Dawning-Places of Thine inspiration, to send down upon me and upon all  that have sought Thy face that which beseemeth Thy generosity and  bountiful grace, and is worthy of Thy bestowals and favors. Poor and  desolate I am, O my Lord! Immerse me in the ocean of Thy wealth; athirst,  suffer me to drink from the living waters of Thy loving-kindness.    I beseech Thee, by Thine own Self and by Him Whom Thou hast appointed as  the Manifestation of Thine own Being and Thy discriminating Word unto all  that are in heaven and on earth, to gather together Thy servants beneath  the shade of the Tree of Thy gracious providence. Help them, then, to  partake of its fruits, to incline their ears to the rustling of its  leaves, and to the sweetness of the voice of the Bird that chanteth upon  its branches. Thou art, verily, the Help in Peril, the Inaccessible, the  Almighty, the Most Bountiful.            XXIV: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I IMPLORE THEE...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! I implore Thee by Them Who are the  Tabernacles of Thy Divine holiness, Who are the Manifestations of Thy  transcendent unity and the Day-Springs of Thine inspiration and  revelation, to grant that Thy servants may not be kept back from this  Divine Law which, at Thy will and according to Thy pleasure, hath branched  out from Thy most great Ocean. Do Thou, then, ordain for them that which  Thou didst ordain for Thy chosen ones and for the righteous among Thy  creatures, whose constancy in Thy Cause the tempests of trials have failed  to shake, and whom the tumults of tests have been powerless to hinder from  magnifying Thy most exalted Word--the Word through Which the heavens of  men's idle fancies and vain imaginations have been split asunder. Thou  art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing.    Enable, then, Thy servants, O my God, to recognize the Day-Star that hath  shone forth above the horizon of Thine irrevocable decree and purpose, and  suffer them not to be deprived of the Paradise which Thou, by Thy name,  the All-Glorious, hast called into being in the heavens of Thine exalted  omnipotence. Cause them, moreover, O my God, to hearken to Thy most sweet  voice, that they may all hasten to recognize Thy unity and acknowledge Thy  oneness, O Thou Who art the Beloved of the hearts of all that yearn after  Thee, and the Object of the adoration of such as have known Thee!    I beseech Thee, by them that have cut down all the idols in this  Revelation through which the Most Grievous Convulsion and the Great Terror  have appeared, to assist, at all times, Thy servants with the signs of  Thine almighty power and the evidences of Thy transcendent and  all-compelling might. Grant, then, that their hearts may be made as strong  as brass, that they may remain unmoved by the overpowering might of such  as have transgressed against Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine Essence  and the Day-Spring of Thine invisible Self, and that they may all arise to  glorify and help Thee, so that through them the ensigns of Thy triumph may  be lifted up in Thy realm, and the standards of Thy Cause may be unfurled  throughout Thy dominions. Thou art He who from everlasting hath, through  the potency of His will, been all-powerful, and will continue to remain  the same for ever and ever. Thou art, verily, the All-Glorious, the Most  High. No God is there but Thee, the Most Powerful, the Most Exalted, the  Help in Peril, the Most Great, the One Being, the Incomparable, the  All-Glorious, the Unrestrained.            XXV: \"GLORIFIED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I BESEECH...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Chosen Ones, and  by the Bearers of Thy Trust, and by Him Whom Thou hast ordained to be the  Seal of Thy Prophets and of Thy Messengers, to let Thy remembrance be my  companion, and Thy love my aim, and Thy face my goal, and Thy name my  lamp, and Thy wish my desire, and Thy pleasure my delight.    I am a sinner, O my Lord, and Thou art the Ever-Forgiving. As soon as I  recognized Thee, I hastened to attain the exalted court of Thy  loving-kindness. Forgive me, O my Lord, my sins which have hindered me  from walking in the ways of Thy good-pleasure, and from attaining the  shores of the ocean of Thy oneness.    There is no one, O my Lord, who can deal bountifully with me to whom I can  turn my face, and none who can have compassion on me that I may crave his  mercy. Cast me not out, I implore Thee, of the presence of Thy grace,  neither do Thou withhold from me the outpourings of Thy generosity and  bounty. Ordain for me, O my Lord, what Thou hast ordained for them that  love Thee, and write down for me what Thou hast written down for Thy  chosen ones. My gaze hath, at all times, been fixed on the horizon of Thy  gracious providence, and mine eyes bent upon the court of Thy tender  mercies. Do with me as beseemeth Thee. No God is there but Thee, the God  of power, the God of glory, Whose help is implored by all men.            XXVI: \"SUFFER ME, O MY GOD, TO DRAW NIGH UNTO THEE,...\"      Suffer me, O my God, to draw nigh unto Thee, and to abide within the  precincts of Thy court, for remoteness from Thee hath well-nigh consumed  me. Cause me to rest under the shadow of the wings of Thy grace, for the  flame of my separation from Thee hath melted my heart within me. Draw me  nearer unto the river that is life indeed, for my soul burneth with thirst  in its ceaseless search after Thee. My sighs, O my God, proclaim the  bitterness of mine anguish, and the tears I shed attest my love for Thee.    I beseech Thee, by the praise wherewith Thou praisest Thyself and the  glory wherewith Thou glorifiest Thine own Essence, to grant that we may be  numbered among them that have recognized Thee and acknowledged Thy  sovereignty in Thy days. Help us then to quaff, O my God, from the fingers  of mercy the living waters of Thy loving-kindness, that we may utterly  forget all else except Thee, and be occupied only with Thy Self. Powerful  art Thou to do what Thou willest. No God is there beside Thee, the Mighty,  the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    Glorified be Thy name, O Thou Who art the King of all Kings!            XXVII: \"THOU BEHOLDEST, O MY GOD, THE DAY-STAR OF THY...\"      Thou beholdest, O my God, the Day-Star of Thy Word shining above the  horizon of Thy prison-city, inasmuch as within its walls He who is the  Manifestation of Thy Self and the Day-Spring of the light of Thy unity  hath raised His voice and uttered Thy praise. The fragrances of Thy love  have thereby been wafted over Thy cities and have encompassed all the  dwellers of Thy realm.    Since Thou hast revealed Thy grace, O my God, deter not Thy servants from  directing their eyes towards it. Consider not, O my God, their estate, and  their concerns and their works. Consider the greatness of Thy glory, and  the plenteousness of Thy gifts, and the power of Thy might, and the  excellence of Thy favors. I swear by Thy glory! Wert Thou to look upon  them with the eye of justice, all would deserve Thy wrath and the rod of  Thine anger. Hold Thou Thy creatures, O my God, with the hands of Thy  grace, and make Thou known unto them what is best for them of all the  things that have been created in the kingdom of Thine invention.    We testify, O my God, that Thou art God, and that there is no God besides  Thee. From eternity Thou hast existed with none to equal or rival Thee,  and wilt abide for ever the same. I beseech Thee, by the eyes which see  Thee stablished upon the throne of unity and the seat of oneness, to aid  all them that love Thee by Thy Most Great Name, and to lift them up into  such heights that they will testify with their own beings and with their  tongues that Thou art God alone, the Incomparable, the One, the  Ever-Abiding. Thou hast had at no time any peer or partner. Thou, in  truth, art the All-Glorious, the Almighty, Whose help is implored by all  men.            XXVIII: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I BEAR WITNESS...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! I bear witness that from eternity Thou  wert exalted in Thy transcendent majesty and might, and wilt to eternity  abide in Thy surpassing power and glory. None in the kingdoms of earth and  heaven can frustrate Thy purpose; none throughout the realms of revelation  and of creation can prevail against Thee. At Thy command Thou doest what  Thou willest, and by the power of Thy sovereignty Thou rulest as Thou  pleasest.    I implore Thee, O Thou Who causest the dawn to appear, by Thy Lamp which  Thou didst light with the fire of Thy love before all that are in"]]]
