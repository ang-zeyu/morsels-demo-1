Dr. Holyday, who according to the same author was highly conceited of  his own worth, especially in his younger Days, but who seems not to  have much reason for being so, died at a Village called Eisley on the  2d day of October 1661, and was three days after buried at the foot of  Bishop King's monument, under the south wall of the [a]isle joining on  the south side to the choir of Christ Church Cathedral, near the  remains of William Cartwright, and Jo. Gregory.    Footnotes:  1. Athen. Oxon. 259. Ed. 1721.  2. Wood ubi supra.  3. Athen.

A writer, in the reign of Charles I, whom we may reckon, says  Langbaine, among poets of the third rate, but who in strict justice  cannot rise above a fifth. He was patronized by Sir John Suckling. He  has seven plays and masks extant, besides other poems, which Mr.  Langbaine says, are entirely his own, and that he has had recourse to  no preceding author for assistance, and in this respect deserves  pardon if not applause from the critic. This he avers in his prologue  to Covent-Garden.      He justifies that 'tis no borrowed strain,    From the invention of another's brain.    Nor did he steal the fancy. 'Tis the fame    He first intended by the proper name.    'Twas not a toil of years: few weeks brought forth,    This rugged issue, might have been more worth,    If he had lick'd it more. Nor doth he raise    From the ambition of authentic plays,    Matter or words to height, nor bundle up    Conceits at taverns, where the wits do sup;    His muse is solitary, and alone    Doth practise her low speculation.    The reader from the above specimen may see what a poet he was; but as  he was in some degree of esteem in his time, we thought it improper to  omit him.    The following are his plays;    1. The Bride, a Comedy; acted in the Year 1638 at a private House in  Drury-Lane by their Majesty's Servants, printed 4to. 1640.    2. Covent Garden, a Comedy; acted in the Year 1632.    3. Hannibal and Scipio, an Historical Tragedy, acted in the year 1635.    4. Microcosmus, a Moral Masque, represented at a private house in  Salisbury Court, printed 1637.    5. Spring's Glory, Vindicating Love by Temperance, against the Tenet,  Sine Cerere & Baccho friget Venus; moralized in a Masque. With other  Poems, Epigrams, Elegies, and Epithalamiums of the author's, printed  in 4to, London, 1638. At the end of these poems is a piece called A  Presentation, intended for the Prince's Birth day, May 29, 1638,  annually celebrated.    6. Tottenham-Court, a Comedy, acted in the year 1633, at a private  house in Salisbury Court, printed in 4to. 1638.    7. Unfortunate Lovers, a Tragedy, never acted, printed in 4to. London,  1640.    Mr. Philips and Mr. Winstanley, according to their old custom, have  ascribed two other anonymous plays to our author: The Woman Hater  Arraigned, a Comedy, and Charles the First, a Tragedy, which Langbaine  has shewn not to be his.                    *        *        *        *        *                                      JAMES SHIRLEY,      A very voluminous dramatic author, was born in the city of London,  and: was descended from the Shirleys in Suffex or Warwickshire; he was  educated in grammar learning in Merchant Taylors school, and  transplanted thence to St. John's College, but in what station he  lived there, we don't find.    Dr. William Laud, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, presiding over  that house, conceived a great affection for our author, and was  willing to cherish and improve those promising abilities early  discoverable in him. Mr. Shirley had always an inclination to enter  into holy orders, but, for a very particular reason, was discouraged  from attempting it by Dr. Laud; this reason to some may appear  whimsical and ridiculous, but has certainly much weight and force in  it.    Shirley had unfortunately a large mole upon his left cheek, which much  disfigured him, and gave him a very forbidding appearance. Laud  observed very justly, that an audience can scarce help conceiving a  prejudice against a man whose appearance shocks them, and were he to  preach with the tongue of an angel, that prejudice could never be  surmounted; besides the danger of women with child fixing their eyes  on him in the pulpit, and as the imagination of pregnant women has  strange influence on the unborn infants, it is somewhat cruel to  expose them to that danger, and by these means do them great injury,  as ones fortune in some measure depends upon exterior comeliness[1].  But Shirley, who was resolute to be in orders, left that university  soon after, went to Cambridge, there took the degrees in arts, and  became a minister near St. Alban's in Hertfordshire; but never having  examined the authority, and purity of the Protestant Church, and being  deluded by the sophistry of some Romish priests, he changed his  religion for theirs[2], quitted his living, and taught a grammar  school in the town of St. Alban's; which employment he finding an  intolerable drudgery, and being of a fickle unsteady temper, he  relinquished it, came up to London, and took lodgings in Gray's Inn,  where he commenced a writer for the stage with tolerable success. He  had the good fortune to gain several wealthy and beneficent patrons,  especially Henrietta Maria the Queen Consort, who made him her  servant.    When the civil war broke out, he was driven from London, and attended  upon his Royal Mistress, while his wife and family were left in a  deplorable condition behind him. Some time after that, when the Queen  of England was forced, by the fury of opposition, to sollicit succours  from France, in order to reinstate her husband; our author could no  longer wait upon her, and was received into the service of William  Cavendish, marquis of Newcastle, to take his fortune with him in the  wars. That noble spirited patron had given him such distinguishing  marks of his liberality, as Shirley thought himself happy in his  service, especially as by these means he could at the same time serve  the King.    Having mentioned Henrietta Maria, Shirley's Royal Mistress, the reader  will pardon a digression, which flows from tenderness, and is no more  than an expression of humanity. Her life-time in England was  embittered with a continued persecution; she lived to see the unhappy  death of her Lord; she witnessed her exiled sons, not only oppressed  with want, but obliged to quit France, at the remonstrance of  Cromwel's ambassador; she herself was loaded with poverty, and as  Voltaire observes, \"was driven to the most calamitous situation that  ever poor lady was exposed to; she was obliged to sollicit Cromwel to  pay her an allowance, as Queen Dowager of England, which, no doubt,  she had a right to demand; but to demand it, nay worse, to be obliged  to beg it of a man who shed her Husband's blood upon a scaffold, is an  affliction, so excessively heightened, that few of the human race ever  bore one so severe.\"    After an active service under the marquis of Newcastle, and the King's  cause declining beyond hope of recovery, Shirley came again to London,  and in order to support himself and family, returned his former  occupation of teaching a school, in White Fryars, in which he was  pretty successful, and, as Wood says, 'educated many ingenious youths,  who, afterwards in various faculties, became eminent.' After the  Restoration, some of the plays our author had written in his leisure  moments, were represented with success, but there is no account  whether that giddy Monarch ever rewarded him for his loyalty, and  indeed it is more probable he did not, as he pursued the duke of  Lauderdale's maxim too closely, of making friends of his enemies, and  suffering his friends to shift for themselves, which infamous maxim  drew down dishonour on the administration and government of Charles  II. Wood further remarks, that Shirley much assisted his patron, the  duke of Newcastle, in the composition of his plays, which the duke  afterwards published, and was a drudge to John Ogilby in his  translation of Homer's Iliad and Odysseys, by writing annotations on  them. At length, after Mr. Shirley had lived to the age of 72, in  various conditions, having been much agitated in the world, he, with  his second wife, was driven by the dismal conflagration that happened  in London, Anno 1666, from his habitation in Fleet-street, to another  in St. Giles's in the Fields. Where, being overcome with miseries  occasioned by the fire, and bending beneath the weight of years, they  both died in one day, and their bodies were buried in one grave, in  the churchyard of St. Giles's, on October 29, 1666.

Major Le Caron, too, stated on oath  before the Parnell Commission that money was sent by the Irish Rebel  Societies, through Aylward, to stir up the Transvaal rebellion. This  is what Aylward says:    All South Africa was for the moment at rest, with the exception of  the district of Utrecht, where an old-standing grievance with  Cetewayo was the cause of some little alarm and excitement (_i.e._,  Cetewayo's threatened invasion). Still, the Transvaal was disturbed  throughout its whole extent by the expectation of some pending  change--a change coming from the outside, which had been invited by  an active, discontented party, chiefly foreigners, dwellers in towns,  non-producers, place-hunters, deserters, refugees, land-speculators,  'development-men,' and pests of Transvaal society generally, who  openly preached resistance to the law, refusal to pay taxes, and  contempt of the natural and guaranteed owners of the country in  which they lived, in the distinctly expressed hope that foreign  intervention would fill the country with British gold, and conduce  to their own material prosperity. The Boers, spread over a country  larger than France, were stunned into stupor by the demonstrative  loudness of the party of discontent. In some districts they (the  Boers) were poor, and could not readily pay the taxes imposed upon  them by the wars and railway projects of the Government. Their  Volksraad was in Session, but its every action was paralyzed by the  gloom of impending dissolution.    The Republic owed L215,000, which it had no immediate means of  paying. Its creditors were clamorous; whilst the Executive, turn to  which side it would, found itself confronted by threats, reproaches,  accusations of slavery and cruelty based upon hearsay, and which,  like the annexation that steadily approached, could not be met,  because neither of them had yet assumed the evidenced consistency of  actual fact. There was no public opinion to support the Government or  to save the Republic. The Boers lived far apart from each other,  whilst the annexationists and the party of disorder dwelt, in compact  communities, in towns and mining villages. Into the midst of this  confusion--into the capital of this bewildered State--entered Sir  Theophilus Shepstone and his staff. He had not come to seize the  country--he had come as 'an adviser, as a helper, and as a friend';  but his advent was a blight--an incubus which rendered additionally  powerless the unfortunate President and his Council. The coming of  Sir Theophilus Shepstone was, to the minds of nearly all, but too  clearly the forerunner of change. In the face of this additional  whet to the anticipations of the party of disturbance, something  that has been described as anarchy prevailed. Everyone waited; all  fell into a state of expectation; no one attempted to save the State,  or repel the danger. At the same time, there was no anarchy in the  proper sense of the word. Justice sat on her seat; criminals were  arrested and brought to trial; actions at law were heard and  determined; and in no one place, save the goldfields, was authority,  even for a moment, defied. There the law vindicated itself without  having used violence or shed one drop of blood. Not one single  public outrage, not one unpunished crime, marked this period of  suspense, which is described by partizan writers as a time of  chaos and anarchy.    Peace was granted to Secocoeni, and the quietness and gloom of the  country became even more profound.    Now, had a commission, royal or joint, been opened in Pretoria to  inquire into the truth of the allegations made against the  Government, history might perhaps be able to record that judgment,  followed by justice, had overtaken the Transvaal. No commission was  opened. There was a banquet and a ball. The suspense increased in  intensity. Understrappers, and agents of the discontented faction,  filled the country with rumours of impending annexation, and  sometimes of impending conquest. The Boers, the inhabitants of the  country, asked day after day what was the mission of the English  Commissioner. They visited him in hundreds; but he knew the wonderful  advantage to be gathered from the heightening of the mystery, and the  intensifying of the excitement. He listened to everyone; but he  maintained a gloomy and impassive silence, neither checking the  aspirations of the annexationists, nor dissipating the forebodings of  the farmers.    News arrived that troops were marching towards, and massing on,  Theophilus sought not to alleviate the anxieties of the Government,  nor to quell the now rising alarm amongst the people; he simply sat  still and listened, watching the writhings and stragglings of the  doomed Volksraad, and awaiting a favourable moment to end its  existence.    At length someone determined to ask: 'Was it not possible to avert  this annexation which loomed before every mind, brooding like a  shadow upon the country?' He went to Sir Theophilus; he asked his  question; and at length the oracle spoke. Without moving a muscle of  his wonderfully impassive countenance, without even raising his eyes  to look at the interlocutor, Sir Theophilus calmly murmured: 'It is  too late!--too late!' And so, without the authorization of the home  Government, without the consent of her Majesty's High Commissioner,  without the concurrence of the Volksraad, against the will of  thirty-nine-fortieths of the people, and in defiance of the protest  of their Executive, as Mr. Anthony Trollope puts it, Sir Theophilus  said: 'Then and from thenceforth the Transvaal shall be British  property!' So he put up the Queen's flag.    Now, it is impossible to conceive anything more admirable for its  discretion, more wisely calculated as to the moment of its  occurrence, or more suavely and yet firmly done than this act. There  was not a blow struck, not a shot fired; and the first impulse of  nearly every person in the country, whether in principle opposed to  annexation or not, was to congratulate Sir Theophilus Shepstone on  the skill, tact, and good fortune with which he had put an end to the  excessive anxiety, the mental strain, the fears, hopes, and  expectations by which the whole country was paralyzed. Whether the  annexation be now held to be right or wrong, its execution, so far as  regards the act itself, was an unparalleled triumph of tact, modesty,  and firmness.    It was not discovered at the moment, and it never entered into any  man's mind to consider, that it was the presence in Pretoria of Sir  Theophilus himself that had created the anxiety, and caused the  paralysis; and that it was his arts and presence that had tightened  and strung up into quivering intensity the mind of the country. He  had broken the spell; he had introduced certainty in place of  uncertainty; and he was congratulated, and very properly so, for the  manner in which he had brought to a conclusion his hazardous mission.    Sir Theophilus Shepstone's despatches record his negotiations with  President Burgers, and the arrangement which allowed him to make a  formal protest against the annexation, so as to satisfy his  Irreconcilables, whilst he in reality not only assented to the  measure, but even assisted the completion of it, and discussed the  details with Shepstone, who in turn had revised President Burgers'  'protest.'    On April 3, 1877, Shepstone had written to Frere:    Mr. Burgers, who had been all along, as far as his conversation and  professions to me went, in full accord with me, had suddenly taken  alarm; he made impossible proposals, all of which involved infinite  delay, and, of course, dangerous agitation. As far as I am concerned,  leave the country, civil war would at once take place, as the natives  would consider it the sunshine in which they could make hay in the  Transvaal; the goldfields are in a state of rebellion against the  Transvaal Government, and they are kept from overt acts only by my  warnings and entreaties.    And eight days later he wrote to Mr. Robert Herbert enclosing his  letter under 'flying seal' to Frere:    There will be a protest against my act of annexation issued by the  Government, but they will at the same time call upon the people to  submit quietly, pending the issue; you need not be disquieted by such  action, because it is taken merely to save appearances, and the  members of the Government from the violence of a faction that seems  for years to have held Pretoria in terror when any act of the  Government displeased it.    You will better understand this when I tell you privately that the  President has from the first fully acquiesced in the necessity for  the change, and that most of the members of the Government have  expressed themselves anxious for it; but none of them have had the  courage openly to express their opinions, so I have had to act  apparently against them; and this I have felt bound to do, knowing  the state and danger of the country, and that three-fourths of the  people will be thankful for the change when once it is made.    Yesterday morning Mr. Burgers came to me to arrange how the matter  should be done. I read to him the draft of my Proclamation, and he  proposed the alteration of two words only, to which I agreed. He  brought to me a number of conditions which he wished me to insert,  which I have accepted, and have embodied in my Proclamation. He told  me that he could not help issuing a protest, to keep the noisy  portion of the people quiet--and you will see grounds for this  precaution when I tell you that there are only half a dozen native  constables to represent the power of the State in Pretoria, and a  considerable number of the Boers in the neighbourhood are of the  lowest and most ignorant class. Mr. Burgers read me, too, the draft"]]]
