[Illustration: BUCKINGHAM PALACE]    The most interesting visitors whom the Queen entertained during her  early married life were the Emperor Nicholas of Russia and Louis  Napoleon of France. The Emperor Nicholas came to England, as he told  the Queen, to see things with his own eyes, and to win, if he could,  the confidence of English statesmen. \"I esteem England highly; but  as to what the French say of me, I care not.\"    He was, however, undoubtedly jealous of this country's growing  friendship with her old enemy, France, but any attempt to weaken this  met with no encouragement.    The Queen, in writing to her uncle Leopold, said, \"He gives Albert  and myself the impression of a man who is _not_ happy, and on whom  the burden of his immense power and position weighs heavily and  painfully. He seldom smiles, and when he does, the expression is  _not_ a happy one. He is very easy to get on with.\" In a further letter  she continued, \"By living in the same house together quietly and  unrestrainedly (and this Albert, and with great truth, says is the  great advantage of these visits, that I not only _see_ these great  people, but _know_ them), I got to know the Emperor and he to know  me. . . . He is sincere, I am certain, _sincere_ even in his most  despotic acts--from a sense that that _is_ the _only_ way to  govern. . . . He _feels_ kindness deeply--and his love for his wife  and children, and for all children, is _very_ great. He has a strong  feeling for domestic life, saying to me, when our children were in  the room: 'These are the sweet moments of our life.' One can see by  the way he takes them up and plays with them that he is very fond  of children.\" And again she wrote: \"He also spoke of princes being  nowadays obliged to strive to make themselves worthy of their  position, so as to reconcile people to the fact of their being  princes.\"    The effect of this visit was to make France somewhat suspicious, and  the Queen expressed her wish that it might not prevent the visit which  had been promised by King Louis Philippe.    There was at one time actually danger of war over trouble in the East,  but King Leopold, whose kingdom was in the happy position of having  its independence guaranteed by the Powers,[2] was able to bring his  influence to bear, and the critical period passed over, to the great  relief of the Queen.    [Footnote 2: This, however, did not protect Belgium in 1914, when  Germany did not hesitate to attack her.]    In 1844 King Louis Philippe paid his promised visit, of which the  Queen said, \"He is the first King of France who comes on a visit to  the Sovereign of this country. A very eventful epoch, indeed, and  one which will surely bring good fruits.\"    The King was immensely pleased with everything he saw, and with the  friendly reception he received. He assured the Queen that France did  not wish to go to war with England, and he told her how pleased he  was that all their difficulties were now smoothed over.    During his stay he was invested with the Order of the Garter--an Order,  it is interesting to recollect, which had been created by Edward the  Third after the Battle of Cressy, and whose earliest knights were  the Black Prince and his companions.    The Corporation of London went to Windsor in civic state to present  the King with an address of congratulation. He declared in his answer  that \"France has nothing to ask of England, and England has nothing  to ask of France, but cordial union.\"    But in 1848 the Orleans dynasty was overthrown, France proclaimed  a republic, and King Louis Philippe, his wife and family were forced  to flee to England. Here in 1850, broken in health, the King died.    In 1852 Louis Napoleon, who had been elected President for life,  created himself Emperor, and in 1855, after the conclusion of the  Crimean War and the death of the Emperor Nicholas, he visited  England.    A State Ball was held of which the Queen wrote: \"How strange to think  that I, the granddaughter of George III, should dance with the  Emperor Napoleon, nephew of England's great enemy, now my nearest  and most intimate ally, in the Waterloo room, and this ally only six  years ago living in this country an exile, poor and unthought of! . . .  I am glad to have known this extraordinary man, whom it is certainly  impossible not to like when you live with him, and not even to a  considerable extent to admire. I believe him to be capable of  kindness, affection, friendship, and gratitude. I feel confidence  in him as regards the future; I think he is frank, means well towards  us, and, as Stockmar says, 'that we have insured his sincerity and  good faith towards us for the rest of his life.'\"    The Queen and her husband paid frequent visits, and made many tours  during their early married life. It was a great source of pleasure  to both of them to feel that everywhere they went they were received  with the greatest delight and enthusiasm.    In 1847 they visited Cambridge University, of which Prince Albert  was now Chancellor. \"Every station and bridge, and resting-place,  and spot of shade was peopled with eager faces watching for the Queen,  and decorated with flowers; but the largest, and the brightest, and  the gayest, and the most excited assemblage was at Cambridge station  itself. . . . I think I never saw so many children before in one  morning, and I felt so much moved at the spectacle of such a mass  of life collected together and animated by one feeling, and that a  joyous one, that I was at a loss to conceive how any woman's sides  can bear the beating of so strong a throb as must attend the  consciousness of being the object of all that excitement, the centre  of attraction to all those eyes. But the Queen has royal strength  of nerve.\"[3]    [Footnote 3: The Duke of Argyll, _Queen Victoria_.]    In 1849 they paid their first visit to Ireland, and received a royal  welcome on landing in Cork. The Queen noticed particularly that  \"the beauty of the women is very remarkable, and struck us much; such  beautiful dark eyes and hair, and such fine teeth; almost every third  woman was pretty, and some remarkably so.\"    The royal children were the objects of great admiration. \"Oh! Queen,  dear!\" screamed a stout old lady, \"make one of them Prince Patrick,  and all Ireland will die for you.\"    In Dublin, the capital of a country which had very recently been in  revolt, the loyal welcome was, if possible, even more striking.    The Queen writes: \"It was a wonderful and striking spectacle, such  masses of human beings, so enthusiastic, so excited, yet such perfect  order maintained; then the numbers of troops, the different bands  stationed at certain distances, the waving of hats and handkerchiefs,  the bursts of welcome which rent the air--all made a  never-to-be-forgotten scene.\"    Lord Clarendon, writing of the results of the Irish tour, said, \"The  people are not only enchanted with the Queen and the gracious  kindness of her manner and the confidence she has shown in them, but  they are pleased with themselves for their own good feelings and  behaviour, which they consider have removed the barrier that  hitherto existed between the Sovereign and themselves, and that they  now occupy a higher position in the eyes of the world.\"    In 1850 they visited for the first time the Palace of Holyrood. This  was a memorable occasion, for since Mary, Queen of Scots, had been  imprisoned there, no queen had ever stayed within its walls.    The Queen took the liveliest interest in the many objects of  historical interest which were shown to her. \"We saw the rooms where  Queen Mary lived, her bed, the dressing-room into which the murderers  entered who killed Rizzio, and the spot where he fell, where, as the  old housekeeper said to me, 'If the lady would stand on that side,'  I would see that the boards were discoloured by the blood. Every step  is full of historical recollections, and our living here is quite  an epoch in the annals of this old pile, which has seen so many deeds,  more bad, I fear, than good.\"    Both the Queen and her husband had an especial love for animals, and  the Queen's suite, when she travelled, always included a number of  dogs. Her favourites were Skye terriers and the so-called  'turnspits' which were introduced into this country by Prince Albert.  One of the Queen's great delights at Windsor was to walk round the  farms and inspect the cattle, which are still, owing largely to the  careful methods of feeding and tending instituted by the Prince,  among the finest in the world. Kindness to animals was a lesson she  taught to all her children, and pictures and statuettes of all her  old favourites were to be found in her homes.

The indicator cards were taken at the central      station by Mr. Idell and his assistants, and the dynamometer      used was of the liquid type made by Mr. Shaw, of Philadelphia.      The diagrams prepared from the data obtained were then explained      by the speaker, who stated that there was not a marked      difference between the 10 ton motor and the 18 ton locomotive in      the initial effort on the level, as will be seen by comparing a      run observed by a railroad officer on March 9 with a steam motor      and a load of about 571/2 tons. The steam motor required 1 min.      and 29 sec. to make the distance from 14th to 23d streets, while      the electric motor with a train of 70 tons made the same trip in      1 min. and 50 sec.; the absence of power brakes compelled the      current to be taken off at 19th street, while it was probable      that the throttle of the steam locomotive was not closed until      it reached 23d street, this being the usual practice. The data      obtained in these experiments shows that 29,940 h.p. is required      to operate the Ninth avenue railroad for the 16 hours' service,      or an average of 1,871 h.p. per hour, or 2,181 h.p., adding      station friction. The varying requirements of the traffic during      the day shows that the service could be advantageously divided      up between four stationary engines of 800 h.p. each, there being      but five hours of the day when all of them would be required.      The fuel consumption per day, allowing 22 lb. of coal per h.p.      per hour at $2.25 per ton, would make a total of $92.25 per diem      for fuel, the coal being a mixture deliverable at the dock for      about $1.80 per ton. The weight of coal used for the present      locomotives is about the same, viz., 40 tons per day, but      practice has shown it to be most economical to use coal of the      best quality, costing $5 per ton, making the cost of fuel about      double that required for the electric system. Without entering      into other economies which the speaker claimed were in favor of      electricity, and ignoring the plan suggested by Sir William      Siemens of braking the train by converting the motor into a      dynamo and thus utilizing the energy of momentum, he believed      that the economy in fuel alone was sufficient to prove that the      application of power by electricity was preferable to direct      steam propulsion for the elevated railroad service.           *       *       *       *       *          MAGNETISM IN ITS RELATION TO INDUCED ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AND  CURRENT.[1]       [Footnote 1: A paper read before the American Institute of     Electrical Engineers, New York, May 22, 1889.]    By ELIHU THOMSON.      There is perhaps no subject which at the present time can have a  greater interest to the physicist, the electrician, and the electrical  engineer than the one which heads this paper. The advances which have  been made in the study from its purely theoretical or scientific side,  and the great technical progress in the utilization of the known facts  and principles concerning magnetic inductions, can but deepen and  strengthen that interest.    On the side of pure theory we find the eager collection of  experimental data to be submitted to the scrutiny of the ablest and  brightest minds, to be examined and reasoned upon with the hope of  finding some clew to satisfying explanations, and on the side of  practice we find the search for new facts and relations no less  diligent, though often stimulated by practical problems presented for  solution. Indeed, the urgency for results is often the greater on the  practical side, for theory can wait, practice cannot, at least in the  United States.    We must look for continued triumphs in both directions, and the most  welcome of all will be the framing of a theory or explanation which  will enable us to interpret magnetic and electric phenomena. The  recent beautiful experiments of Hertz on magnetic waves have opened a  fertile region for investigation.    It would seem that the study of magnetism and electricity will give us  the ability to investigate the ether of space, which medium has been  theorized upon at great length, with the result of leaving it very  much where it was before, a mysterious necessity.    Faraday says, speaking of magnetism:        \"Such an action may be a function of the ether, for it is not at      all unlikely that if there be an ether it should have other uses      than simply the conveyance of radiations.\" 3,075. Vol. III.,      Exp. Res.        \"It may be a vibration of the hypothetical ether, or a state of      tension of that ether equivalent to either a dynamic or a static      condition,\" etc. 3,263. Vol. III., Exp. Res.    Faraday again says, speaking of the magnetic power of a vacuum:        \"What that surrounding magnetic medium deprived of all material      substance may be I cannot tell, perhaps the ether.\" 3,277. Vol.      III., Exp. Res.    Modern views would seem to point that through a study of magnetic  phenomena we may take a feeble hold upon the universal ether.  Magnetism is an action or condition of that medium, and it may be that  electrical actions are the expression of molecular disturbances  brought about by ether strains or interferences. The close relations  which are shown to exist between magnetism and light tend to  strengthen such views. Indeed, it would not be too much to expect that  if the mechanics of the ether are ever worked out, we should find the  relation between sensible heat and electric currents to be as close as  that of light to magnetism, perhaps find ultimately the forms of  matter, the elements and compounds to be the more complex  manifestations of the universal medium--aggregations in stable  equilibrium. It is a difficult conception, I confess, and a most  shadowy and imperfect one, yet facts and inferences which favor such  views are not wanting.    Our science of electricity seems almost to be in the same condition  that chemistry was before the work of Lavoisier had shed its light on  chemical theory. Our store of facts is daily increasing, and  apparently disconnected phenomena are being brought into harmonious  relation. Perhaps the edifice of complete theory will not be more than  begun in our time, perhaps the building process will be a very gradual  one, but I cannot refrain from the conviction that the intelligence of  man will, if it has time, continue its advance until such a structure  exists.    I have been led to make these general allusions to electrical theory  in order to emphasize the fact that in the present paper no unraveling  of the mystery is to be attempted, but rather the presentation of some  few considerations upon a subject of absorbing interest.    The conception of Faraday in regard to the existence of lines of  magnetic force representing directions of magnetic strain or tension  in a medium has not only lost nothing of its usefulness up to the  present time, but has continually been of great service in the  understanding of magnetic phenomena. We need spend no time in showing,  as Faraday and others have done, that these lines are always closed  circuits, polarized so that the direction of the lines cannot be  reversed without reversal of the actions. Nor need we take time to  show that in any medium the lines are mutually repellent laterally if  of the same direction of polarization. Opposing this tendency to  separation or lateral diffusion of magnetic force is the strong  apparent tendency of the lines to shorten themselves in any medium.  These actions are distributed by the presentation of a better medium,  as iron instead of space or air. Lines of force will move into the  better medium, having apparently the constant tendency to diminish the  resistance in their paths.    The peculiar and mysterious nature of media, such as iron, is to  permit an extraordinary crowding of lines on account of slight  resistance to their passage through it. We need not, in addition, do  more than refer to the other well-known facts of an electric current  developing magnetic lines encircling the conductor, as being the  general type, which includes all forms of magnetic field or  electro-magnets, sustained by currents, and the fact of a development  when magnetic lines or circuits and material masses are in relative  movement of electromotive forces transversely to the direction of the  lines of magnetism, and also transversely to the direction of relative  movement, as in the case of electric conductors traversing or cutting  through a field, or of a field traversing or being moved across a  conductor. We must not forget that even insulators, as well as  conductors, cutting lines of force, have the electromotive force  developed in them. The action simply develops potential difference,  and this generates the current where a circuit exists. While we are in  the habit of saying that a conductor moved across a field of lines, or  _vice versa_, generates electric current, I think the statement  incomplete. The movement only sets up a potential difference, and the  power expended in effecting the movement generates C x E. The current  is energy less the potential, or the energy expended gives the two  effects of potential or pressure and current or rate of movement.  Consequently an insulator, or an open-circuited conductor, traversing  a field, consumes no energy, potential difference only being produced.  Nevertheless, as will be shown, the magnetic circuits or lines  themselves may furnish the energy for their own movement across a  conductor, and so develop current as well as potential.    This occurs in the effort of lines to shorten their paths, to lessen  their density, to pass to better media. Indeed, a close examination  will show that wherever power is expended in developing current in a  circuit, cutting lines of force, the energy"]]]
