I went up the  left bank to see if the gullies which formerly ran into the bay had  altered, so as to allow camels to cross them: they seemed to have  become shallower. There was no wind for the dhow, and as for the  man-of-war towing her, it was out of the question. On the 23rd the  cutter did try to tow the dhow, but without success, as a strong tide  runs constantly out of the river at this season. A squall came up from  the S.E., which would have taken the dhow in, but the master was on  board the _Penguin_, and said he had no large sail. I got him off to  his vessel, but the wind died away before we could reach the mouth of  the river.    _24th March, 1866._--I went to the dhow, and there being no wind I  left orders with the captain to go up the right bank should a breeze  arise. Mr. Fane, midshipman, accompanied me up the left bank above, to  see if we could lead the camels along in the water. Near the point  where the river first makes a little bend to the north, we landed and  found three formidable gullies, and jungle so thick with bush,  date-palms, twining bamboo, and hooked thorns, that one could scarcely  get along. Further inland it was sticky mud, thickly planted over with  mangrove roots and gullies in whose soft banks one sank over the  ankles. No camels could have moved, and men with extreme difficulty  might struggle through; but we never could have made an available  road. We came to a she-hippopotamus lying in a ditch, which did not  cover her; Mr. Fane fired into her head, and she was so upset that she  nearly fell backward in plunging up the opposite bank: her calf was  killed, and was like sucking-pig, though in appearance as large as a  full-grown sow.    We now saw that the dhow had a good breeze, and she came up along the  right bank and grounded at least a mile from the spot where the  mangroves ceased. The hills, about two hundred feet high, begin about  two or three miles above that, and they looked invitingly green and  cool. My companion and I went from the dhow inland, to see if the  mangroves gave way, to a more walkable country, but the swamp covered  over thickly with mangroves only became worse the farther we receded  from the river. The whole is flooded at high tides, and had we landed  all the men we should have been laid up with fever ere we could have  attained the higher land, which on the right bank bounds the line of  vision, and the first part of which lies so near. I thought I had  better land on the sand belt on the left of Rovuma Bay, and then  explore and get information from the natives, none of whom had as yet  come near us, so I ordered the dhow to come down to the spot next day,  and went on board the _Penguin_. Lieutenant Garforth was excessively  kind, and though this is his best time for cruising in the North, he  most patiently agreed to wait and help me to land.    _24th March, 1866._--During the night it occurred to me that we should  be in a mess if after exploration and information from the natives we  could find no path, and when I mentioned this, Lieutenant Garforth  suggested that we should proceed to Kilwa, so at 5 A.M. I went up to  the dhow with Mr. Fane, and told the captain that we were going there.  He was loud in his protestations against this, and strongly  recommended the port of Mikindany, as quite near to Rovuma, Nyassa,  and the country I wished to visit, besides being a good landing-place,  and the finest port on the coast. Thither we went, and on the same  evening landed all our animals in Mikindany bay, which lies only  twenty-five miles N. of Rovuma. The _Penguin_ then left.    The Rovuma is quite altered from what it was when first we visited it.  It is probable that the freshets form banks inside the mouth, which  are washed out into the deep bay, and this periodical formation  probably has prevented the Arabs from using the Rovuma as a port of  shipment. It is not likely that Mr. May[4] would have made a mistake  if the middle were as shoal as now: he found soundings of three  fathoms or more.    [Illustration: Dhow used for Transport of Dr. Livingstone's Camels.]    _25th March, 1866._--I hired a house for four dollars a month and  landed all our goods from the dhow. The bay gives off a narrow  channel, about 500 yards wide and 200 yards long, the middle is deep,  but the sides are coral reefs and shoal: the deep part seems about 100  yards wide. Outside in the Bay of Mikindany there is no anchorage  except on the edge of the reef where the _Penguin_ got seven fathoms,  but further in it was only two fathoms. The inner bay is called Pemba,  not Pimlea, as erroneously printed in the charts of Owen. It is deep  and quite sheltered; another of a similar round form lies somewhat to  the south: this bay may be two miles square.    The cattle are all very much the worse for being knocked about in the  dhow. We began to prepare saddles of a very strong tree called Ntibwe,  which is also used for making the hooked spear with which hippopotami  are killed--the hook is very strong and tough; I applied also for  twenty carriers and a Banian engaged to get them as soon as possible.  The people have no cattle here, they are half-caste Arabs mostly, and  quite civil to us.    _26th March, 1866._--A few of the Nassick boys have the slave spirit  pretty strongly; it goes deepest in those who have the darkest skins.  Two Gallah men are the most intelligent and hardworking among them;  some look on work with indifference when others are the actors.    Now that I am on the point of starting on another trip into Africa I  feel quite exhilarated: when one travels with the specific object in  view of ameliorating the condition of the natives every act becomes  ennobled.    Whether exchanging the customary civilities, or arriving at a village,  accepting a night's lodging, purchasing food for the party, asking for  information, or answering polite African enquiries as to our objects  in travelling, we begin to spread a knowledge of that people by whose  agency their land will yet become enlightened and freed from the  slave-trade.    The mere animal pleasure of travelling in a wild unexplored country is  very great. When on lands of a couple of thousand feet elevation,  brisk exercise imparts elasticity to the muscles, fresh and healthy  blood circulates through the brain, the mind works well, the eye is  clear, the step is firm, and a day's exertion always makes the  evening's repose thoroughly enjoyable.    We have usually the stimulus of remote chances of danger either from  beasts or men. Our sympathies are drawn out towards our humble hardy  companions by a community of interests, and, it may be, of perils,  which make us all friends. Nothing but the most pitiable puerility  would lead any manly heart to make their inferiority a theme for  self-exaltation; however, that is often done, as if with the vague  idea that we can, by magnifying their deficiencies, demonstrate our  immaculate perfections.    The effect of travel on a man whose heart is in the right place is  that the mind is made more self-reliant: it becomes more confident of  its own resources--there is greater presence of mind. The body is soon  well-knit; the muscles of the limbs grow as hard as a board, and seem  to have no fat; the countenance is bronzed, and there is no dyspepsia.  Africa is a most wonderful country for appetite, and it is only when  one gloats over marrow bones or elephant's feet that indigestion is  possible. No doubt much toil is involved, and fatigue of which  travellers in the more temperate climes can form but a faint  conception; but the sweat of one's brow is no longer a curse when one  works for God: it proves a tonic to the system, and is actually a  blessing. No one can truly appreciate the charm of repose unless he  has undergone severe exertion.    _27th March, 1866._--The point of land which on the north side of the  entrance to the harbour narrows it to about 300 yards is alone called  Pemba; the other parts have different names. Looking northwards from  the point, the first hundred yards has ninety square houses of wattled  daub; a ruin (a mosque) has been built of lime and coral. The whole  point is coral, and the soil is red, and covered over with dense  tropical vegetation, in which the baobab is conspicuous. Dhows at  present come in with ease by the easterly wind which blows in the  evening, and leave next morning, the land wind taking them out.    While the camels and other animals are getting over their fatigues  and bad bruises, we are making camels' saddles, and repairing those of  the mules and buffaloes. Oysters abound on all the rocks and on the  trees over which the tide flows: they are small, but much relished by  the people.    The Arabs here are a wretched lot physically--thin, washed-out  creatures--many with bleared eyes.    _29-30th March, 1866._--- This harbour has somewhat the shape of a  bent bow or the spade on a playing-card, the shaft of the arrow being  the entrance in; the passage is very deep, but not more than 100 yards  wide, and it goes in nearly S.W.; inside it is deep and quite secure,  and protected from all winds. The lands westward rise at once to about  200 feet, and John, a hill, is the landmark by which it is best known  in coming along the coast--so say the Arabs. The people have no  cattle, but say there are no tsetse flies: they have not been  long here, _i.e._ under the present system; but a ruin on the  northern peninsula or face of the entrance, built of stone and  lime--Arab-fashion, and others on the north-west, show that the place  has been known and used of old.

This powerful phalanx gave to the royalists a stronger hold in  the west than their opponents had in any one part of the much wider  territory within their sphere of influence. There was no baronial  counterpart to the successful raiding of the north and east, which John  had carried through in the last months of his life. A baronial centre,  like Worcester, could not hold its own long in the west. Moreover, John  had not entirely forfeited his hereditary advantages. The  administrative families, whose chief representative was the justiciar  Hubert de Burgh, held to their tradition of unswerving loyalty, and  joined with the followers of the old king, of whom William Marshal was  the chief survivor. All over England the royal castles were in safe  hands, and so long as they remained unsubdued, no part of Louis'  dominions was secure. The crown had used to the full its rights over  minors and vacant fiefs. The subjection of the south-west was assured  by the marriage of the mercenary leader, Falkes de Breaute, to the  mother of the infant Earl of Devon, and by the grant of Cornwall to the  bastard of the last of the Dunstanville earls. Though Isabella,  Countess of Gloucester, John's repudiated wife, was as zealous as her  new husband, the Earl of Essex, against John's son, Falkes kept a tight  hand over Glamorgan, on which the military power of the house of  Gloucester largely depended. Randolph of Chester was custodian of the  earldoms of Leicester and Richmond, of which the nominal earls, Simon  de Montfort and Peter Mauclerc, were far away, the one ruling Toulouse,  and the other Brittany. The band of foreign adventurers, the mainstay  of John's power, was still unbroken. Ruffians though these hirelings  were, they had experience, skill, and courage, and were the only  professional soldiers in the country.    The vital fact of the situation was that the immense moral and  spiritual forces of the Church remained on the side of the king.  Innocent III. had died some months before John, but his successor,  Honorius III., continued to uphold his policy. The papal legate, the  Cardinal Gualo, was the soul of the royalist cause. Louis and his  adherents had been excommunicated, and not a single English bishop  dared to join openly the foes of Holy Church. The most that the  clerical partisans of the barons could do was to disregard the  interdict and continue their ministrations to the excommunicated host.  The strongest English prelate, Stephen Langton, Archbishop of  Canterbury, was at Rome in disgrace. Walter Grey, Archbishop of York,  and Hugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln, were also abroad, while the  Bishop of London, William of Sainte-Mere-Eglise, was incapacitated by  illness. Several important sees, including Durham and Ely, were vacant.  The ablest resident bishop, Peter des Roches of Winchester, was an  accomplice in John's misgovernment.    The chief obstacle in the way of the royalists had been the character  of John, and the little Henry of Winchester could have had no share in  the crimes of his father. But the dead king had lately shown such rare  energy that there was a danger lest the accession of a boy of nine  might not weaken the cause of monarchy. The barons were largely out of  hand. The war was assuming the character of the civil war of Stephen's  days, and John's mercenaries were aspiring to play the part of feudal  potentates. It was significant that so many of John's principal  supporters were possessors of extensive franchises, like the lords of  the Welsh March, who might well desire to extend these feudal  immunities to their English estates. The triumph of the crown through  such help might easily have resolved the united England of Henry II.  into a series of lordships under a nominal king.    The situation was saved by the wisdom and moderation of the papal  legate, and the loyalty of William Marshal, who forgot his interests as  Earl of Pembroke in his devotion to the house of Anjou. From the moment  of John's death at Newark, the cardinal and the marshal took the lead.  They met at Worcester, where the tyrant was buried, and at once made  preparations for the coronation of Henry of Winchester. The ceremony  took place at St. Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, on October 28, from which  day the new reign was reckoned as beginning. The marshal, who had  forty-three years before dubbed the \"young king\" Henry a knight, then  for a second time admitted a young king Henry to the order of chivalry.  When the king had recited the coronation oath and performed homage to  the pope, Gualo anointed him and placed on his head the plain gold  circlet that perforce did duly for a crown.[1] Next day Henry's leading  supporters performed homage, and before November 1 the marshal was made  justiciar.        [1] There is some conflict of evidence on this point, and Dr.      Stubbs, following Wendover, iv., 2, makes Peter of Winchester      crown Henry. But the official account in _Faedera, i._, 145, is      confirmed by _Ann. Tewkesbury_, p. 62; _Histoire de G. le      Marechal_, lines 15329-32; _Hist. des ducs de Normandie, et des      rois d'Angleterre_, p. 181, and _Ann. Winchester_, p. 83.      Wykes, p. 60, and _Ann. Dunstable_, p. 48, which confirm      Wendover, are suspect by reason of other errors.    On November 2 a great council met at Bristol. Only four earls appeared,  and one of these, William of Fors, Earl of Albemarle, was a recent  convert. But the presence of eleven bishops showed that the Church had  espoused the cause of the little king, and a throng of western and  marcher magnates made a sufficient representation of the lay baronage.  The chief business was to provide for the government during the  minority. Gualo withstood the temptation to adopt the method by which  Innocent III. had ruled Sicily in the name of Frederick II. The king's  mother was too unpopular and incompetent to anticipate the part played  by Blanche of Castile during the minority of St. Louis. After the  precedents set by the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, the barons took the  matter into their own hands. Their work of selection was not an easy  one. Randolph of Chester was by far the most powerful of the royalist  lords, but his turbulence and purely personal policy, not less than his  excessive possessions and inordinate palatine jurisdictions, made him  unsuitable for the regency. Yet had he raised any sort of claim, it  would have been hardly possible to resist his pretensions.[1] Luckily,  Randolph stood aside, and his withdrawal gave the aged earl marshal the  position for which his nomination as justiciar at Gloucester had  already marked him out. The title of regent was as yet unknown, either  in England or France, but the style, \"ruler of king and kingdom,\" which  the barons gave to the marshal, meant something more than the ordinary  position of a justiciar. William's friends had some difficulty in  persuading him to accept the office. He was over seventy years of age,  and felt it would be too great a burden. Induced at last by the legate  to undertake the charge, from that moment he shrank from none of its  responsibilities. The personal care of the king was comprised within  the marshal's duties, but he delegated that branch of his work to Peter  des Roches.[2] These two, with Gualo, controlled the whole policy of the  new reign. Next to them came Hubert de Burgh, John's justiciar, whom  the marshal very soon restored to that office. But Hubert at once went  back to the defence of Dover, and for some time took little part in  general politics.        [1] The fears and hopes of the marshal's friends are well      depicted in _Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal_, lines      15500-15708.        [2] The panegyrist of the marshal emphasises strongly the fact      that Peter's charge was a delegation, _ibid._, lines      17993-18018.    On November 12, the legate and the regent issued at Bristol a  confirmation of the Great Charter. Some of the most important articles  accepted by John in 1215 were omitted, including the \"constitutional  clauses\" requiring the consent of the council of barons for  extraordinary taxation. Other provisions, which tied the hands of the  government, were postponed for further consideration in more settled  times. But with all its mutilations the Bristol charter of 1216 marked a  more important moment than even the charter of Runnymede. The  condemnation of Innocent III. would in all probability have prevented  the temporary concession of John from becoming permanent. Love of  country and love of liberty were doubtless growing forces, but they were  still in their infancy, while the papal authority was something ultimate  against which few Christians dared appeal. Thus the adoption by the free  will of the papal legate, and the deliberate choice of the marshal of  the policy of the Great Charter, converted, as has well been said, \"a  treaty won at the point of the sword into a manifesto of peace and sound  government\".[1] This wise change of policy cut away the ground from under  the feet of the English supporters of Louis. The friends of the young  Henry could appeal to his innocence, to his sacred unction, and to his  recognition by Holy Church. They offered a programme of limited  monarchy, of the redress of grievances, of vested rights preserved, and  of adhesion to the good old traditions that all Englishmen respected.  From that moment the Charter became a new starting-point in our history.        [1] Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, ii., 21.    In strange contrast to this programme of reform, the aliens, who had  opposed the charter of Runnymede, were among the lords by whose counsel  and consent the charter of Bristol was issued. In its weakness the new  government sought to stimulate the zeal both of the foreign mercenaries  and of the loyal barons by grants and privileges which seriously  entrenched upon the royal authority."]]]
