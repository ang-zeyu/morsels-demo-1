[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18435"],[0,"Good Things to Eat, as Suggested (#5)"],[1,". Season with salt, pepper  and pounded mace, moisten with a few tablespoonfuls of white stock.  Butter a pie dish, line the edges with puff paste and put in the  mixture, placing puff paste over the top. Trim it around the edges,  moisten and press together, cut a small hole in the top, and bake in a  moderate oven. When cooked, pour a small quantity of hot cream through  the hole in the top of the pie, and serve.      ~HAM CROQUETTES~--Chop very fine one-fourth of a pound of ham; mix with  it an equal quantity of boiled and mashed potatoes, two hard boiled eggs  chopped, one tablespoonful chopped parsley. Season to taste. Then stir  in the yolk of an egg. Flour the hands and shape the mixture into small  balls. Fry in deep fat. Place on a dish, garnish with parsley and serve.      ~HASH WITH DROPPED EGGS~--Mince or grind cold cooked meat and add  two-thirds as much cold chopped vegetables. The best proportions of  vegetables are half potato and one-quarter each of beets and carrots.  Put a little gravy stock or hot water with butter melted in it, into a  saucepan, turn in the meat and vegetables and heat, stirring all the  time. Season with salt, pepper, and a little onion juice if liked. Turn  into a buttered baking dish, smooth over, and set in the oven to brown.  Take up and press little depressions in the top, and drop an egg into  each. Set back into the oven until the egg is set, but not cooked hard.  Serve in the same dish.      ~LAMB CHOPS EN CASSEROLE~--Trim off the superfluous fat from the chops,  and place them in a casserole with a medium sized onion, sliced and  separated into rings. Cover each layer of chops with the onion rings,  then add a pint of boiling water. Cover and cook for one hour and  one-half in a moderate oven. Add salt and pepper and some sliced carrot,  and cook until the carrot is tender. Remove the chops to a hot platter  and pour over them the gravy which may be thickened, then garnish with  the carrot.      ~LAMB CURRY~--Cut the meat into small pieces, (and the inferior  portions, such as the neck can be utilized in a curry), roll in flour  and fry in hot olive oil, pork fat, or butter, until a rich brown. Mince  or slice an onion and fry in the same way. Then put into a saucepan,  cover with boiling water, and simmer until the bones and gristly pieces  will slip out. When the meat is sufficiently tender add a cupful each  strained tomato and rice, then a powder. Cook ten minutes longer and  serve.      ~MEAT PIE~--Chop fine, enough of cold roast beef to make two cupfuls,  also one small onion, pare as many potatoes as desired and boil, mash  and cream as for mashed potatoes. Drain a cupful of tomato liquid free  from seeds, stir meat, onion and tomato juice together, put in a deep  dish, spread potatoes over the top and bake in a hot oven.      ~MINCED MUTTON~--Mince the meat from a cold roast of mutton, put into a  saucepan. Make a roux, moisten with a little stock and season with salt  and pepper, adding butter and some gherkins. Put the minced meat into  the sauce and let it cook without boiling. Serve with thin slices of  bread around the plate.      ~PIG'S EARS, LYONNAISE~--Singe off all the hair from pig's ears, scrape  and wash well and cut lengthwise into strips. Place them in a saucepan  with a little stock, add a small quantity of flour, a few slices of  onion fried, salt and pepper to taste. Place the pan over a slow fire  and simmer until the ears are thoroughly cooked. Arrange on a dish, add  a little lemon juice to the liquor and pour over the ears. Serve with a  garnish of fried bread.      ~PORK CUTLETS AND ANCHOVY SAUCE~--Broil on a well greased gridiron, over  the fire, nicely cut and trimmed cutlets of pork. Place frills on the  bones of the cutlets. Serve very hot with Anchovy Sauce.      ~RAGOUT OF COOKED MEAT~--Cut one pint of cold meat into half-inch dice,  removing the fat, bone and gristle. Put the meat into a stew pan, cover  with boiling water and simmer slowly two or three hours or until very  tender. Then add half a can of mushrooms cut fine, two tablespoons of  lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Wet one tablespoonful of  cornstarch to a smooth paste with a little cold water and stir into the  boiling liquor, add a teaspoon of caramel if not brown enough. Cook ten  minutes and serve plain or in a border of mashed potatoes. The seasoning  may be varied by using one teaspoon of curry powder, a few grains of  cayenne or half a tumbler of currant jelly and salt to taste.      ~RICE AND BEEF CROQUETTES~--To use up cold meat economically combine two  cups of chopped beef or mutton with two cups of freshly boiled rice.  Season well with salt, pepper, onion juice, a large teaspoon of minced  parsley, and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Pack on a large plate and set  away to cool. After the mixture is cold, shape into croquettes, dip into  beaten egg, roll in fine crumbs and fry in smoking hot fat.      ~ROLLED RIB ROAST~--Have the backbone and ribs removed and utilize them  for making a stew for lunch. Tie the meat into a round shape and  sprinkle it with salt and pepper, then dredge with flour and place in a  dripping pan. Have the oven hot when the meat is first put into it, in  order that it may be seared over quickly to prevent the juices from  escaping. Then reduce the heat and baste with the fat in the pan. When  done place on a hot platter and surround with riced potato.      ~SHEEP'S BRAINS, WITH SMALL ONIONS~--Take sheep's brains. Soak in  lukewarm water and blanch. Stew with thin slices of bacon, a little  white wine, parsley, shallots, cloves, small onions, salt and pepper.  When done arrange the brains on a dish, with the onion's around; reduce  the sauce and serve. Calves' brains may be dressed in the same way.      ~SHEEP'S TONGUES~--Sheep's tongues are usually boiled in water and then  broiled. To dress them, first skin and split down the center. Dip them  in butter or sweet oil, mixed with parsley, green onions, mushrooms,  clove of garlic, all shredded fine, salt and pepper. Then cover with  bread crumbs and broil. Serve with an acid sauce.      ~SHOULDER OF VEAL BRAISED~--Buy a shoulder of veal and ask the butcher  to bone it and send the bones with the meat. Cover the bones with cold  water and when it comes to a boil skim, then add a little onion and  carrot and a few seasoning herbs and any spices desired. Simmer gently  for an hour or so until you have a pint of stock. To make the stuffing  take a stale loaf, cut off the crust and soak in a little cold water  until soft. Rub the crumbs of the loaf as fine as possible in the hands,  then add to the soaked and softened crust. Chop a half cup of suet fine,  put into a frying pan a tablespoon of the suet, and when hot add an  onion chopped fine. Cook until brown then add to the bread with regular  poultry seasoning or else salt, pepper, and a bit of thyme. Mix well and  stuff the cavity in the shoulder, then pull the flaps of the meat over  and sew up. Put the rest of the suet in the frying pan and having  dusted the meat with flour, salt and pepper and a sprinkling of sugar,  brown on all sides in the fat into the bottom of the braising pan, which  may be any shallow iron pot or granite kettle with a tight cover, put a  layer of thin sliced onions and carrots, a bit of bay leaf and sprigs of  parsley, and on this lay the meat. Add two or three cloves, pour hot  stock around it, cover closely and braise in a hot oven for three hours.      ~SPANISH CHOPS~--Gash six French chops on outer edge, extending cut more  than half way through lean meat. Stuff, dip in crumbs, egg and crumbs,  fry in deep fat five minutes and drain on brown paper.    For the stuffing mix six tablespoons of soft bread crumbs, three  tablespoons of chopped cooked ham, two tablespoons chopped mushroom  caps, two tablespoons melted butter, salt and pepper to taste.      ~HARICOT OF MUTTON~--To make a la bourgeoise, cut a shoulder of mutton  in pieces about the width of two fingers. Mix a little butter with a  tablespoonful of flour and place over a slow fire, stirring until the  color of cinnamon. Put in the pieces of meat, giving them two or three  turns over the fire, then add some stock, if you have it, or about half  pint of hot water, which must be stirred in a little at a time. Season  with salt, pepper, parsley, green onions, bay leaf, thyme, garlic,  cloves, and basil. Set the whole over a slow fire and when half done  skim off as much fat as possible. Have ready some turnips, cut in  pieces, and stew with the meat. When done take out the herbs and skim  off what fat remains, reducing the stock if too thin.      ~VEAL CROQUETTES~--Make a thick sauce from one cup of milk, two level  tablespoons of butter, and four level tablespoons of flour. Cook five  minutes, season with salt, pepper and celery salt, and a few drops of  lemon juice, and a tablespoon of finely minced parsley. Add two cups of  cold cooked veal chopped fine and cool the mixture. Shape into little  rolls, dip in an egg beaten with one tablespoon of water then roll in  fine bread crumbs. Fry in deep smoking hot fat. Be sure to coat the  whole surface with egg and to have the fat very hot, as the mixture has  been cooked once and merely needs beating to the center and browning on  the outside.      ~VEAL LOAF~--Mince fine three pounds lean raw veal and a quarter of a  pound of fat pork. Add a half onion chopped fine or grated, a  tablespoonful of salt, a teaspoonful pepper and a teaspoonful seasoning  herbs. Mix well, add two-thirds of a cup cracker crumbs, a half cup veal  gravy, the yolk of one egg and the whites of two beaten together. Form  into a loaf, pressing firmly together. Brush over with the yolk of an  egg, dust with finely rolled cracker crumbs and set in a greased rack in  the dripping pan. When it begins to brown, turn a cup of hot water into  the pan and baste frequently until done. It will take about an hour and  a half in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18440"],[0,"Logic: Deductive and Inductive (#5)"],[1,"bodies  with various attributes, existing in space and changing in time; and  that certain principles, such as Contradiction and Causation, are true  of things and events. But Metaphysicians have raised many plausible  objections to these assumptions. It has been urged that natural objects  do not really exist on their own account, but only in dependence on some  mind that contemplates them, and that even space and time are only our  way of perceiving things; or, again, that although things do really  exist on their own account, it is in an entirely different way from that  in which we know them. As to the principle of Contradiction--that if an  object has an attribute, it cannot at the same time and in the same way  be without it (e.g., if an animal is conscious, it is false that it is  not conscious)--it has been contended that the speciousness of this  principle is only due to the obtuseness of our minds, or even to the  poverty of language, which cannot make the fine distinctions that exist  in Nature. And as to Causation, it is sometimes doubted whether events  always have physical causes; and it is often suggested that, granting  they have physical causes, yet these are such as we can neither perceive  nor conceive; belonging not to the order of Nature as we know it, but to  the secret inwardness and reality of Nature, to the wells and reservoirs  of power, not to the spray of the fountain that glitters in our  eyes--'occult causes,' in short. Now these doubts and surmises are  metaphysical spectres which it remains for Metaphysics to lay. Logic has  no direct concern with them (although, of course, metaphysical  discussion is expected to be logical), but keeps the plain path of plain  beliefs, level with the comprehension of plain men. Metaphysics, as  examining the grounds of Logic itself, is sometimes regarded as 'the  higher Logic'; and, certainly, the study of Metaphysics is necessary to  every one who would comprehend the nature and functions of Logic, or the  place of his own mind and of Reason in the world.    (d) The relation of Logic to Psychology will be discussed in the next  section.    (e) As a Regulative Science, pointing out the conditions of true  inference (within its own sphere), Logic is co-ordinate with (i) Ethics,  considered as assigning the conditions of right conduct, and with (ii)  AEsthetics, considered as determining the principles of criticism and  good taste.    Sec. 6. Three principal schools of Logicians are commonly recognised:  Nominalist, Conceptualist, and Materialist, who differ as to what it is  that Logic really treats of: the Nominalists say, 'of language'; the  Conceptualists, 'of thought'; the Materialists, 'of relations of fact.'  To illustrate these positions let us take authors who, if some of them  are now neglected, have the merit of stating their contrasted views with  a distinctness that later refinements tend to obscure.    (a) Whately, a well-known Nominalist, regarded Logic as the Science and  Art of Reasoning, but at the same time as \"entirely conversant about  language\"; that is to say, it is the business of Logic to discover those  modes of statement which shall ensure the cogency of an argument, no  matter what may be the subject under discussion. Thus, _All fish are  cold-blooded_, .'. _some cold-blooded things are fish:_ this is a sound  inference by the mere manner of expression; and equally sound is the  inference, _All fish are warm-blooded_, .'. _some warm-blooded things are  fish_. The latter proposition may be false, but it follows; and  (according to this doctrine) Logic is only concerned with the consistent  use of words: the truth or falsity of the proposition itself is a  question for Zoology. The short-coming of extreme Nominalism lies in  speaking of language as if its meaning were unimportant. But Whately did  not intend this: he was a man of great penetration and common-sense.    (b) Hamilton, our best-known Conceptualist, defined Logic as the science  of the \"formal laws of thought,\" and \"of thought as thought,\" that is,  without regard to the matter thought about. Just as Whately regarded  Logic as concerned merely with cogent forms of statement, so Hamilton  treated it as concerned merely with the necessary relations of thought.  This doctrine is called Conceptualism, because the simplest element of  thought is the Concept; that is, an abstract idea, such as is signified  by the word _man, planet, colour, virtue_; not a representative or  generic image, but the thought of all attributes common to any class of  things. Men, planets, colours, virtuous actions or characters, have,  severally, something in common on account of which they bear these  general names; and the thought of what they have in common, as the  ground of these names, is a Concept. To affirm or deny one concept of  another, as _Some men are virtuous_, or _No man is perfectly virtuous_,  is to form a Judgment, corresponding to the Proposition of which the  other schools of Logic discourse. Conceptualism, then, investigates the  conditions of consistent judgment.    To distinguish Logic from Psychology is most important in connection  with Conceptualism. Concepts and Judgments being mental acts, or  products of mental activity, it is often thought that Logic must be a  department of Psychology. It is recognised of course, that Psychology  deals with much more than Logic does, with sensation, pleasure and pain,  emotion, volition; but in the region of the intellect, especially in its  most deliberate and elaborate processes, namely, conception, judgment,  and reasoning, Logic and Psychology seem to occupy common ground. In  fact, however, the two sciences have little in common except a few  general terms, and even these they employ in different senses. It is  usual to point out that Psychology tries to explain the subjective  _processes_ of conception, judgment and reasoning, and to give their  natural history; but that Logic is wholly concerned with the _results_  of such processes, with concepts, judgments and reasonings, and merely  with the validity of the results, that is, with their truth or  consistency; whilst Psychology has nothing to do with their validity,  but only with their causes. Besides, the logical judgment (in Formal  Logic at least) is quite a different thing from the psychological: the  latter involves feeling and belief, whereas the former is merely a given  relation of concepts. _S is P_: that is a model logical judgment; there  can be no question of believing it; but it is logically valid if _M is  P_ and _S is M_. When, again, in Logic, one deals with belief, it  depends upon evidence; whereas, in Psychology belief is shown to depend  upon causes which may have evidentiary value or may not; for Psychology  explains quite impartially the growth of scientific insight and the  growth of prejudice.    (c) Mill, Bain, and Venn are the chief Materialist logicians; and to  guard against the error of confounding Materialism in Logic with the  ontological doctrine that nothing exists but Matter, it may suffice to  remember that in Metaphysics all these philosophers are Idealists.  Materialism in Logic consists in regarding propositions as affirming or  denying relations (_cf._ Sec. 5) between matters-of-fact in the widest  sense; not only physical facts, but ideas, social and moral relations;  it consists, in short, in attending to the meaning of propositions. It  treats the first principles of Contradiction and Causation as true of  things so far as they are known to us, and not merely as conditions or  tendencies of thought; and it takes these principles as conditions of  right thinking, because they seem to hold good of Nature and human life.    To these differences of opinion it will be necessary to recur in the  next chapter (Sec. 4); but here I may observe that it is easy to exaggerate  their importance in Logic. There is really little at issue between  schools of logicians as such, and as far as their doctrines run  parallel; it is on the metaphysical grounds of their study, or as to its  scope and comprehension, that they find a battle-field. The present work  generally proceeds upon the third, or Materialist doctrine. If Deduction  and Induction are regarded as mutually dependent parts of one science,  uniting the discipline of consistent discourse with the method of  investigating laws of physical phenomena, the Materialist doctrine, that  the principles of Logic are founded on fact, seems to be the most  natural way of thinking. But if the unity of Deduction and Induction is  not disputed by the other schools, the Materialist may regard them as  allies exhibiting in their own way the same body of truths. The  Nominalist may certainly claim that his doctrine is indispensable:  consistently cogent forms of statement are necessary both to the  Conceptualist and to the Materialist; neither the relations of thought  nor those of fact can be arrested or presented without the aid of  language or some equivalent system of signs. The Conceptualist may urge  that the Nominalist's forms of statement and argument exist for the sake  of their meaning, namely, judgments and reasonings; and that the  Materialist's laws of Nature are only judgments founded upon our  conceptions of Nature; that the truth of observations and experiments  depends upon our powers of perception; that perception is inseparable  from understanding, and that a system of Induction may be constructed  upon the axiom of Causation, regarded as a principle of Reason, just as  well as by considering it as a law of Nature, and upon much the same  lines. The Materialist, admitting all this, may say that a judgment is  only the proximate meaning of a proposition, and that the ultimate  meaning, the meaning of the judgment itself, is always some  matter-of-fact; that the other schools have not hitherto been eager to  recognise the unity of Deduction and Induction or to investigate the  "]]]
