As Elsie she was to  have gone into the furnace of his art, and she was to have come out the  Woman all men desire! Her thoughts were to have been culled from his own  finest, her form from his dearest dreams, and her setting wherever he  could find one fit for her worth. He had brooded long before making the  attempt; then one day he had felt her stir within him as a mother feels  a quickening, and he had begun to write; and so he had added chapter to  chapter....    And those fifteen sodden chapters were what he had produced!    Again he sat, softly moving his finger....    Then he bestirred himself.    She must go, all fifteen chapters of her. That was settled. For what was  to take her place his mind was a blank; but one thing at a time; a man  is not excused from taking the wrong course because the right one is not  immediately revealed to him. Better would come if it was to come;  in the meantime--    He rose, fetched the fifteen chapters, and read them over before he  should drop them into the fire.    But instead of putting them into the fire he let them fall from his hand.  He became conscious of the dripping of the tap again. It had a tinkling  gamut of four or five notes, on which it rang irregular changes, and it  was foolishly sweet and dulcimer-like. In his mind Oleron could see the  gathering of each drop, its little tremble on the lip of the tap, and the  tiny percussion of its fall, \"Plink--plunk,\" minimised almost to  inaudibility. Following the lowest note there seemed to be a brief  phrase, irregularly repeated; and presently Oleron found himself waiting  for the recurrence of this phrase. It was quite pretty....    But it did not conduce to wakefulness, and Oleron dozed over his fire.    When he awoke again the fire had burned low and the flames of the candles  were licking the rims of the Sheffield sticks. Sluggishly he rose,  yawned, went his nightly round of door-locks and window-fastenings, and  passed into his bedroom. Soon he slept soundly.    But a curious little sequel followed on the morrow. Mrs. Barrett usually  tapped, not at his door, but at the wooden wall beyond which lay Oleron's  bed; and then Oleron rose, put on his dressing-gown, and admitted her. He  was not conscious that as he did so that morning he hummed an air; but  Mrs. Barrett lingered with her hand on the door-knob and her face a  little averted and smiling.    \"De-ar me!\" her soft falsetto rose. \"But that will be a very o-ald tune,  Mr. Oleron! I will not have heard it this for-ty years!\"    \"What tune?\" Oleron asked.    \"The tune, indeed, that you was humming, sir.\"    Oleron had his thumb in the flap of a letter. It remained there.    \"_I_ was humming?... Sing it, Mrs. Barrett.\"    Mrs. Barrett prut-prutted.    \"I have no voice for singing, Mr. Oleron; it was Ann Pugh was the singer  of our family; but the tune will be very o-ald, and it is called 'The  Beckoning Fair One.'\"    \"Try to sing it,\" said Oleron, his thumb still in the envelope; and Mrs.  Barrett, with much dimpling and confusion, hummed the air.    \"They do say it was sung to a harp, Mr. Oleron, and it will be very  o-ald,\" she concluded.    \"And _I_ was singing that?\"    \"Indeed you wass. I would not be likely to tell you lies.\"    With a \"Very well--let me have breakfast,\" Oleron opened his letter; but  the trifling circumstance struck him as more odd than he would have  admitted to himself. The phrase he had hummed had been that which he had  associated with the falling from the tap on the evening before.      V    Even more curious than that the commonplace dripping of an ordinary  water-tap should have tallied so closely with an actually existing air  was another result it had, namely, that it awakened, or seemed to awaken,  in Oleron an abnormal sensitiveness to other noises of the old house. It  has been remarked that silence obtains its fullest and most impressive  quality when it is broken by some minute sound; and, truth to tell, the  place was never still. Perhaps the mildness of the spring air operated on  its torpid old timbers; perhaps Oleron's fires caused it to stretch its  old anatomy; and certainly a whole world of insect life bored and  burrowed in its baulks and joists. At any rate, Oleron had only to sit  quiet in his chair and to wait for a minute or two in order to become  aware of such a change in the auditory scale as comes upon a man who,  conceiving the midsummer woods to be motionless and still, all at once  finds his ear sharpened to the crepitation of a myriad insects.    And he smiled to think of man's arbitrary distinction between that which  has life and that which has not. Here, quite apart from such recognisable  sounds as the scampering of mice, the falling of plaster behind his  panelling, and the popping of purses or coffins from his fire, was a  whole house talking to him had he but known its language. Beams settled  with a tired sigh into their old mortices; creatures ticked in the walls;  joints cracked, boards complained; with no palpable stirring of the air  window-sashes changed their positions with a soft knock in their frames.  And whether the place had life in this sense or not, it had at all events  a winsome personality. It needed but an hour of musing for Oleron to  conceive the idea that, as his own body stood in friendly relation to his  soul, so, by an extension and an attenuation, his habitation might  fantastically be supposed to stand in some relation to himself. He even  amused himself with the far-fetched fancy that he might so identify  himself with the place that some future tenant, taking possession, might  regard it as in a sense haunted. It would be rather a joke if he, a  perfectly harmless author, with nothing on his mind worse than a novel he  had discovered he must begin again, should turn out to be laying the  foundation of a future ghost!...    In proportion, however, as he felt this growing attachment to the fabric  of his abode, Elsie Bengough, from being merely unattracted, began to  show a dislike of the place that was more and more marked. And she did  not scruple to speak of her aversion.    \"It doesn't belong to to-day at all, and for you especially it's bad,\"  she said with decision. \"You're only too ready to let go your hold on  actual things and to slip into apathy; _you_ ought to be in a place  with concrete floors and a patent gas-meter and a tradesmen's lift. And  it would do you all the good in the world if you had a job that made you  scramble and rub elbows with your fellow-men. Now, if I could get you a  job, for, say, two or three days a week, one that would allow you heaps  of time for your proper work--would you take it?\"    Somehow, Oleron resented a little being diagnosed like this. He thanked  Miss Bengough, but without a smile.    \"Thank you, but I don't think so. After all each of us has his own life  to live,\" he could not refrain from adding.    \"His own life to live!... How long is it since you were out, Paul?\"    \"About two hours.\"    \"I don't mean to buy stamps or to post a letter. How long is it since you  had anything like a stretch?\"    \"Oh, some little time perhaps. I don't know.\"    \"Since I was here last?\"    \"I haven't been out much.\"    \"And has _Romilly_ progressed much better for your being cooped up?\"    \"I think she has. I'm laying the foundations of her. I shall begin the  actual writing presently.\"    It seemed as if Miss Bengough had forgotten their tussle about the first  _Romilly_. She frowned, turned half away, and then quickly turned again.    \"Ah!... So you've still got that ridiculous idea in your head?\"    \"If you mean,\" said Oleron slowly, \"that I've discarded the old  _Romilly_, and am at work on a new one, you're right. I have still got  that idea in my head.\"    Something uncordial in his tone struck her; but she was a fighter. His  own absurd sensitiveness hardened her. She gave a \"Pshaw!\" of impatience.    \"Where is the old one?\" she demanded abruptly.    \"Why?\" asked Oleron.    \"I want to see it. I want to show some of it to you. I want, if you're  not wool-gathering entirely, to bring you back to your senses.\"    This time it was he who turned his back. But when he turned round again  he spoke more gently.    \"It's no good, Elsie. I'm responsible for the way I go, and you must  allow me to go it--even if it should seem wrong to you. Believe me, I  am giving thought to it.... The manuscript? I was on the point of burning  it, but I didn't. It's in that window-seat, if you must see it.\"    Miss Bengough crossed quickly to the window-seat, and lifted the lid.  Suddenly she gave a little exclamation, and put the back of her hand  to her mouth. She spoke over her shoulder:    \"You ought to knock those nails in, Paul,\" she said.    He strode to her side.    \"What? What is it? What's the matter?\" he asked. \"I did knock them  in--or, rather, pulled them out.\"    \"You left enough to scratch with,\" she replied, showing her hand. From  the upper wrist to the knuckle of the little finger a welling red wound  showed.    \"Good--Gracious!\" Oleron ejaculated.... \"Here, come to the bathroom and  bathe it quickly--\"    He hurried her to the bathroom, turned on warm water, and bathed and  cleansed the bad gash. Then, still holding the hand, he turned cold water  on it, uttering broken phrases of astonishment and concern.    \"Good Lord, how did that happen! As far as I knew I'd ... is this water  too cold? Does that hurt? I can't imagine how on earth ... there; that'll  do--\"    \"No--one moment longer--I can bear it,\" she murmured, her eyes closed....    Presently he led her back to the sitting-room and bound the hand in one  of his handkerchiefs; but his face did not lose its expression of  perplexity. He had spent half a day in opening and making serviceable the  three window-boxes, and he could not conceive how he had come to leave an  inch and a half of rusty nail standing in the wood."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#5)"],[1,"practitioners are quite ignorant  compared to the ancient masters, for they lack the fundamental knowledge  upon which the work is based.    Not only may the mental states, etc., of one's self be changed or  transmuted by Hermetic Methods; but also the states of others may be,  and are, constantly transmuted in the same way, usually unconsciously,  but often consciously by some understanding the laws and principles, in  cases where the people affected are not informed of the principles of  self-protection. And more than this, as many students and practitioners  of modern mental science know, every material condition depending upon  the minds of other people may be changed or transmuted in accordance  with the earnest desire, will, and \"treatments\" of person desiring  changed conditions of life. The public are so generally informed  regarding these things at present, that we do not deem it necessary to  mention the same at length, our purpose at this point being merely to  show the Hermetic Principle and Art underlying all of these various  forms of practice, good and evil, for the force can be used in opposite  directions according to the Hermetic Principles of Polarity.    In this little book we shall state the basic principles of Mental  Transmutation, that all who read may grasp the Underlying Principles,  and thus possess the Master-Key that will unlock the many doors of the  Principle of Polarity.    We shall now proceed to a consideration of the first of the Hermetic  Seven Principles--the Principle of Mentalism, in which is explained the  truth that \"THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is Mental,\" in the words of  The Kybalion. We ask the close attention, and careful study of this  great Principle, on the part of our students, for it is really the Basic  Principle of the whole Hermetic Philosophy, and of the Hermetic Art of  Mental Transmutation.        CHAPTER IV    THE ALL        \"Under, and back of, the Universe of Time, Space and Change,      is ever to be found The Substantial Reality--the Fundamental      Truth.\"--The Kybalion.    \"Substance\" means: \"that which underlies all outward manifestations; the  essence; the essential reality; the thing in itself,\" etc. \"Substantial\"  means: \"actually existing; being the essential element; being real,\" etc.  \"Reality\" means: \"the state of being real; true, enduring; valid; fixed;  permanent; actual,\" etc.    Under and behind all outward appearances or manifestations, there must  always be a Substantial Reality. This is the Law. Man considering the  Universe, of which he is a unit, sees nothing but change in matter,  forces, and mental states. He sees that nothing really IS, but that  everything is BECOMING and CHANGING. Nothing stands still-everything is  being born, growing, dying-the very instant a thing reaches its height,  it begins to decline--the law of rhythm is in constant operation--there  is no reality, enduring quality, fixity, or substantiality in anything--  nothing is permanent but Change. He sees all things evolving from other  things, and resolving into other things--constant action and reaction;  inflow and outflow; building up and tearing down; creation and  destruction; birth, growth and death. Nothing endures but Change. And if  he be a thinking man, he realizes that all of these changing things must  be but outward appearances or manifestations of some Underlying  Power--some Substantial Reality.    All thinkers, in all lands and in all times, have assumed the necessity  for postulating the existence of this Substantial Reality. All  philosophies worthy of the name have been based upon this thought. Men  have given to this Substantial Reality many names-some have called it by  the term of Deity (under many titles). Others have called it \"The  Infinite and Eternal Energy\" others have tried to call it \"Matter\"--but  all have acknowledged its existence. It is self-evident it needs no  argument.    In these lessons we have followed the example of some of the world's  greatest thinkers, both ancient and modern--the Hermetic. Masters--and  have called this Underlying Power--this Substantial Reality--by the  Hermetic name of \"THE ALL,\" which term we consider the most  comprehensive of the many terms applied by Man to THAT which transcends  names and terms.    We accept and teach the view of the great Hermetic thinkers of all  times, as well as of those illumined souls who have reached higher  planes of being, both of whom assert that the inner nature of THE ALL is  UNKNOWABLE. This must be so, for naught by THE ALL itself can comprehend  its own nature and being.    The Hermetists believe and teach that THE ALL, \"in itself,\" is and must  ever be UNKNOWABLE. They regard all the theories, guesses and  speculations of the theologians and metaphysicians regarding the inner  nature of THE ALL, as but the childish efforts of mortal minds to grasp  the secret of the Infinite. Such efforts have always failed and will  always fail, from the very nature of the task. One pursuing such  inquiries travels around and around in the labyrinth of thought, until  he is lost to all sane reasoning, action or conduct, and is utterly  unfitted for the work of life. He is like the squirrel which frantically  runs around and around the circling treadmill wheel of his cage,  traveling ever and yet reaching nowhere--at the end a prisoner still,  and standing just where he started.    And still more presumptuous are those who attempt to ascribe to THE ALL  the personality, qualities, properties, characteristics and attributes  of themselves, ascribing to THE ALL the human emotions, feelings, and  characteristics, even down to the pettiest qualities of mankind, such as  jealousy, susceptibility to flattery and praise, desire for offerings  and worship, and all the other survivals from the days of the childhood  of the race. Such ideas are not worthy of grown men and women, and are  rapidly being discarded.    (At this point, it may be proper for me to state that we make a  distinction between Religion and Theology--between Philosophy and  Metaphysics. Religion, to us, means that intuitional realization of the  existence of THE ALL, and one's relationship to it; while Theology means  the attempts of men to ascribe personality, qualities, and  characteristics to it; their theories regarding its affairs, will,  desires, plans, and designs, and their assumption of the office of ''  middle-men'' between THE ALL and the people. Philosophy, to us, means  the inquiry after knowledge of things knowable and thinkable; while  Metaphysics means the attempt to carry the inquiry over and beyond the  boundaries and into regions unknowable and unthinkable, and with the  same tendency as that of Theology. And consequently, both Religion and  Philosophy mean to us things having roots in Reality, while Theology and  Metaphysics seem like broken reeds, rooted in the quicksands of  ignorance, and affording naught but the most insecure support for the  mind or soul of Man. we do not insist upon our students accepting these  definitions--we mention them merely to show our position.  At any rate, you shall hear very little about Theology and Metaphysics  in these lessons.)    But while the essential nature of THE ALL is Unknowable, there are  certain truths connected with its existence which the human mind finds  itself compelled to accept. And an examination of these reports form a  proper subject of inquiry, particularly as they agree with the reports  of the Illumined on higher planes. And to this inquiry we now invite  you.        \"THAT which is the Fundamental Truth--the Substantial      Reality--is beyond true naming, but the Wise Men call      it THE ALL.\"--The Kybalion.        \"In its Essence, THE ALL is UNKNOWABLE.\"--The Kybalion.        \"But, the report of Reason must be hospitably received,      and treated with respect.\"--The Kybalion.    The human reason, whose reports we must accept so long as we think at  all, informs us as follows regarding THE ALL, and that without  attempting to remove the veil of the Unknowable:        (1) THE ALL must be ALL that REALLY IS. There can be      nothing existing outside of THE ALL, else THE ALL would      not be THE ALL.        (2) THE ALL must be INFINITE, for there is nothing else      to define, confine, bound, limit; or restrict THE ALL.      It must be Infinite in Time, or ETERNAL,--it must have      always continuously existed, for there is nothing else to      have ever created it, and something can never evolve from      nothing, and if it had ever \"not been,\" even for a moment,      it would not \"be\" now,--it must continuously exist forever,      for there is nothing to destroy it, and it can never      \"not-be,\" even for a moment, because something can never      become nothing. It must be Infinite in Space--it must be      Everywhere, for there is no place outside of THE ALL--it      cannot be otherwise than continuous in Space, without break,      cessation, separation, or interruption, for there is nothing      to break, separate, or interrupt its continuity, and nothing      with which to \"fill in the gaps.\" It must be Infinite in      Power, or Absolute, for there is nothing to limit, restrict,      restrain, confine, disturb or condition it--it is subject to      no other Power, for there is no other Power.        (3) THE ALL must be IMMUTABLE, or not subject to change in      its real nature, for there is nothing to work changes upon it      nothing into which it could change, nor from which it could      have changed. It cannot be added to nor subtracted from;      increased nor diminished; nor become greater or lesser in any      respect whatsoever. It must have always been, and must always      remain, just what it is now--THE ALL--there has never been,      is not now, and never will be, anything else into which it      can change.    THE ALL being Infinite, Absolute, Eternal and Unchangeable it must  follow that anything"]]]
