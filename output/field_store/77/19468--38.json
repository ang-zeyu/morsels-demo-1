[Illustration: FIG. 309. Simple form of ornamental reticulation.  Ancient Peruvian work.]    [Illustration: FIG. 310. Reticulated pattern in cotton cloth. Work of  the ancient Peruvians.]    In a similar way four other bands of narrow open work are introduced,  two above and two below the wide band. These are produced by leaving  the warp threads free for a short space and drawing alternate pairs  across each other and fixing them so by means of a woof thread, as  shown in the cut.    Examples of netting in which decorative features have been worked are  found among the textile products of many American tribes and occur as  well in several groups of ancient fabrics, but in most cases where  designs of importance or complexity are desired parts are introduced  to facilitate the work.    _Superconstructive features._--These features, so important in the  decoration of fabrics, are the result of devices by which a  construction already capable of fulfilling the duties imposed by  function has added to it parts intended to enhance beauty and which  may or may not be of advantage to the fabric. They constitute one of  the most widely used and effective resources of the textile  decorator, and are added by sewing or stitching, inserting, drawing,  cutting, applying, appending, &c. They add enormously to the capacity  for producing relievo effects and make it possible even to render  natural forms in the round. Notwithstanding this fact--the most  important section of this class of features--embroidery is treated to  better advantage under color phenomena, as color is very generally  associated with the designs.    [Illustration: FIG. 311. Open work design embroidered upon a net-like  fabric. From a grave at Ancon, Peru.]    One example of lace-like embroidery may be given in this place. It is  probably among the best examples of monochrome embroidery America has  produced. In design and in method of realization it is identical with  the rich, colored embroideries of the ancient Peruvians, being worked  upon a net foundation, as shown in Fig. 311. The broad band of figures  employs bird forms in connection with running geometric designs, and  still more highly conventional bird forms are seen in the narrow band.    Appended ornaments are not amenable to the geometric laws of  fabrication to the extent observed in other classes of ornament. They  are, however, attached in ways consistent with the textile system, and  are counted and spaced with great care, producing designs of a more or  less pronounced geometric character. The work is a kind of embroidery,  the parts employed being of the nature of pendants.    These include numberless articles derived from nature and art. It will  suffice to present a few examples already at hand.    [Illustration: FIG. 312. Basket with pendent buckskin strands tipped  with bits of tin. Apache Indians--1/8.]    Fig. 312 illustrates a large, well made basket, the work of the Apache  Indians. It serves to indicate the method of employing tassels and  clustered pendants, which in this case consist of buckskin strings  tipped with conical bits of tin. The checker pattern is in color.    [Illustration: FIG. 313. Basket with pendants of beads and bits of  shell, work of the northwest coast Indians.--1/4.]    Fig. 313 illustrates the use of other varieties of pendants. A feather  decked basket made by the northwest coast Indians is embellished with  pendent ornaments consisting of strings of beads tipped with bits of  bright shell. The importance of this class of work in higher forms of  textiles may be illustrated by an example from Peru. It is probable  that American art has produced few examples of tasseled work more  wonderful than that of which a fragment is shown in Fig. 314. It is a  fringed mantle, three feet in length and nearly the same in depth,  obtained from an ancient tomb. The body is made up of separately woven  bands, upon which disk-like and semilunar figures representing human  faces are stitched, covering the surface in horizontal rows. To the  center of these rosette-like parts clusters of tassels of varying  sizes are attached. The fringe, which is twenty inches deep, is  composed entirely of long strings of tassels, the larger tassels  supporting clusters of smaller ones. There are upwards of three  thousand tassels, the round heads of which are in many cases woven in  colors, ridges, and nodes to represent the human features. The general  color of the garment, which is of fine, silky wool, is a rich crimson.  The illustration can convey only a hint of the complexity and beauty  of the original.    [Illustration: FIG. 314. Tassel ornamentation from an ancient Peruvian  mantle.]    We have now seen how varied and how striking are the surface  characters of fabrics as expressed by the third dimension, by  variation from a flat, featureless surface, and how all, essential and  ornamental, are governed by the laws of geometric combination. We  shall now see how these are related to color phenomena.      COLOR PHENOMENA.    _Ordinary features._--In describing the constructive characters of  fabrics and the attendant surface phenomena, I called attention to the  fact that a greater part of the design manifested is enforced and  supplemented by color, which gives new meaning to every feature. Color  elements are present in the art from its very inception, and many  simple patterns appear as accidents of textile aggregation long before  the weaver or the possessor recognizes them as pleasing to the eye.  When, finally, they are so recognized and a desire for greater  elaboration springs up, the textile construction lends itself readily  to the new office and under the esthetic forces brings about wonderful  results without interfering in the least with the technical perfection  of the articles embellished. But color is not confined to the mere  emphasizing of figures already expressed in relief. It is capable of  advancing alone into new fields, producing patterns and designs  complex in arrangement and varied in hue, and that, too, without  altering the simple, monotonous succession of relievo characters.    In color, as in relieved design, each species of constructive  combination gives rise to more or less distinct groups of decorative  results, which often become the distinguishing characteristics of the  work of different peoples and the progenitors of long lines of  distinctions in national decorative conceptions.    In addition to this apparently limitless capacity for expression,  lovers of textile illumination have the whole series of extraordinary  resources furnished by expedients not essential to ordinary  construction, the character and scope of which have been dwelt upon to  some extent in the preceding section.    I have already spoken of color in a general way, as to its necessary  presence in art, its artificial application to fabrics and fabric  materials, its symbolic characters, and its importance to esthetic  progress. My object in this section is to indicate the part it takes  in textile design, its methods of expression, the processes by which  it advances in elaboration, and the part it takes in all geometric  decoration.    It will be necessary, in the first place, to examine briefly the  normal tendencies of color combination while still under the direct  domination of constructive elaboration. In the way of illustration,  let us take first a series of filaments, say in the natural color of  the material, and pass through them in the simplest interlaced style a  second series having a distinct color. A very simple geometric pattern  is produced, as shown in Fig. 315. It is a sort of checker, an  emphasized presentation of the relievo pattern shown in Fig. 291, the  figures running horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Had these  filaments been accidentally associated in construction, the results  might have been the same, but it is unnecessary to indicate in detail  the possibilities of adventitious color combinations. So far as they  exhibit system at all it is identical with the relievo elaboration.    [Illustration: FIG. 315. Pattern produced by interlacing strands of  different colors.]    [Illustration: FIG. 316. Pattern produced by modifying the alternation  of fillets.]    [Illustration: FIG. 317. Isolated figures produced by modifying the  order of intersection.]    Assuming that the idea of developing these figures into something more  elaborate and striking is already conceived, let us study the  processes and tendencies of growth. A very slight degree of ingenuity  will enable the workman to vary the relation of the parts, producing a  succession of results such, perhaps, as indicated in Fig. 316. In  this example we have rows of isolated squares in white which may be  turned hither and thither at pleasure, within certain angles, but they  result in nothing more than monotonous successions of squares.    [Illustration: FIG. 318. Pattern produced by simple alternations of  light and dark fillets. Basketry of the Indians of British Guiana.]    Additional facility of expression is obtained by employing dark  strands in the vertical series also, and large, isolated areas of  solid color may be produced by changing the order of intersection,  certain of the fillets being carried over two or more of the opposing  series and in contiguous spaces at one step, as seen in Fig. 317. With  these elementary resources the weaver has very considerable powers of  expression, as will be seen in Fig. 318, which is taken from a basket  made by South American Indians, and in Fig. 341, where human figures  are delineated. The patterns in such cases are all rigidly geometric  and exhibit stepped outlines of a pronounced kind. With impacting and  increased refinement of fillets the stepped character is in a  considerable measure lost sight of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17740"],[0,"The Chemistry of Hat Manufacturing (#5)"],[1,"itrogen. Thirdly, I will heat some fur with soda-lime.  Ammonia escapes, giving all the reactions described under silk. Hence  fur, wool, etc., contain nitrogen. As regards proofs of all three of  these classes of fibres containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the  char they all leave behind on heating in a closed vessel is the carbon  itself present. For the hydrogen and oxygen, a perfectly dry sample of  any of these fabrics is taken, of course in quantity, and heated  strongly in a closed vessel furnished with a condensing worm like a  still. You will find all give you water as a condensate--the vegetable  fibre, acid water; the animal fibres, alkaline water from the ammonia.  The presence of water proves both hydrogen and oxygen, since water is a  compound of these elements. If you put a piece of potassium in contact  with the water, the latter will at once decompose, the potassium  absorbing the oxygen, and setting free the hydrogen as gas, which you  could collect and ignite with a match, when you would find it would  burn. That hydrogen was the hydrogen forming part of your cotton, silk,  or wool, as the case might be. We must now attack the question of  sulphur. First, we prepare a little alkaline lead solution (sodium  plumbate) by adding caustic soda to a solution of lead acetate or sugar  of lead, until the white precipitate first formed is just dissolved.  That is one of our reagents; the other is a solution of a red-coloured  salt called nitroprusside of sodium, made by the action of nitric acid  on sodium ferrocyanide (yellow prussiate). The first-named is very  sensitive to sulphur, and turns black directly. To show this, we take a  quantity of flowers of sulphur, dissolve in caustic soda, and add to the  lead solution. It turns black at once, because the sulphur unites with  the lead to form black sulphide of lead. The nitroprusside, however,  gives a beautiful crimson-purple coloration. Now on taking a little  cotton and heating with the caustic alkaline lead solution, if sulphur  were present in that cotton, the fibre would turn black or brown, for  the lead would at once absorb such sulphur, and form in the fibre soaked  with it, black sulphide of lead. No such coloration is formed, so cotton  does not contain sulphur. Secondly, we must test silk. Silk contains  nitrogen, like wool, but does it contain sulphur? The answer furnished  by our tests is--no! since the fibre is not coloured brown or black on  heating with the alkaline lead solution. Thirdly, we try some white  Berlin wool, so that we can easily see the change of colour if it takes  place. In the hot lead solution the wool turns black, lead sulphide  being formed. On adding the nitroprusside solution to a fresh portion of  wool boiled with caustic soda, to dissolve out the sulphur, a splendid  purple coloration is produced. Fur and hair would, of course, do the  same thing. Lead solutions have been used for dyeing the hair black; not  caustic alkaline solutions like this, however. They would do something  more than turn the hair black--probably give rise to some vigorous  exercise of muscular power! Still it has been found that even the lead  solutions employed have, through gradual absorption into the system,  whilst dyeing the hair black, also caused colics and contractions of the  limbs.    Having now found means for proving the presence of the various elements  composing cotton, silk, and wool, fur or hair, we come to methods that  have been proposed for distinguishing these fibres more generally, and  for quantitatively determining them in mixtures. One of the best of the  reagents for this purpose is the basic zinc chloride already referred  to. This is made as follows: 100 parts of fused zinc chloride, 85 parts  of water, and 4 parts of zinc oxide are boiled together until a clear  solution is obtained. This solution dissolves silk slowly in the cold,  quickly if hot, and forms a thick gummy liquid. Wool, fur, and vegetable  fibres are not affected by it. Hence if we had a mixture, and treated  with this solution, we could strain off the liquid containing the  dissolved silk, and would get cotton and wool left. On weighing before  and after such treatment, the difference in weights would give us the  silk present. The residue boiled with caustic soda would lose all its  wool, which is soluble in hot strong caustic alkali. Again straining  off, we should get only the cotton or other vegetable fibre left, and  thus our problem would be solved. Of course there are certain additional  niceties and modifications still needed, and I must refer you for the  method in full to the _Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry_,  1882, page 64; also 1884, page 517. I will now conclude with some tests  with alkaline and acid reagents, taken in order, and first the acids.  These will also impress upon our minds the effects of acids and alkalis  on the different kinds of fibres.    I. In three flasks three similar portions of cotton lamp-wick, woollen  yarn, and silk are placed, after previously moistening them in water and  wringing them out. To each is now added similar quantities of  concentrated sulphuric acid. The cotton is quickly broken up and  dissolved, especially if assisted by gentle warming, and at last a  brown, probably a black-brown, solution is obtained. The woollen is a  little broken up, but not much to the naked eye, and the vitriol is not  coloured. The silk is at once dissolved, even in the cold acid. We now  add excess of water to the contents of each flask. A brownish, though  clear, solution is produced in the case of cotton; the woollen floats  not much injured in the acid, whilst a clear limpid solution is obtained  with the silk. On adding tannic acid solution to all three, only the  silk yields a precipitate, a rather curdy one consisting of fibroin.    II. Three specimens of cotton, wool, and silk, respectively, are touched  with nitric acid. Cotton is not coloured, but wool and silk are stained  yellow; they are practically dyed.    III. Three specimens, of cotton, wool, and silk, respectively, are  placed in three flasks, and caustic soda solution of specific gravity  1.05 (10 deg. Twaddell) is added. On boiling, the wool and silk dissolve,  whilst the cellulose fibre, cotton, remains undestroyed.    IV. If, instead of caustic soda as in III., a solution of oxide of  copper in ammonia be used, cotton and silk are dissolved, but wool  remains unchanged, _i.e._ undissolved. If sugar or gum solutions be  added to the solutions of cotton and silk, the cotton cellulose is  precipitated, whilst the silk is not, but remains in solution.    V. Another alkaline solvent for silk, which, however, leaves undissolved  cotton and wool, is prepared as follows: 16 grains of copper sulphate  (\"blue vitriol,\" \"bluestone\") are dissolved in 150 c.c. of water, and  then 16 grains of glycerin are added. To this mixture a solution of  caustic soda is added until the precipitate first formed is just  re-dissolved, so as not to leave an excess of caustic soda present.          LECTURE III    WATER: ITS CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES; IMPURITIES AND THEIR ACTION; TESTS  OF PURITY      I have already had occasion to refer, in my last Lecture, to water as a  chemical substance, as a compound containing and consisting of hydrogen  and oxygen. What are these water constituents, hydrogen and oxygen? Each  of them is a gas, but each a gas having totally different properties. On  decomposing water and collecting the one of these two gases, the  hydrogen gas, in one vessel, and the other, the oxygen gas, in another  vessel, twice as large a volume of hydrogen gas is given off by the  decomposing water as of oxygen. You may now notice a certain meaning in  the formula assigned to water, H_{2}O: two volumes of hydrogen combined  with one of oxygen; and it may be added that when such combination takes  place, not three volumes of resulting water vapour (steam), but two  volumes are produced. This combination of the two gases, when mixed  together, is determined by heating to a high temperature, or by passing  an electric spark; it then takes place with the consequent sudden  condensation of three volumes of mixture to two of compound, so as to  cause an explosion. I may also mention that as regards the weights of  these bodies, oxygen and hydrogen, the first is sixteen times as heavy  as the second; and since we adopt hydrogen as the unit, we may consider  H to stand for hydrogen, and also to signify 1--the unit; whilst O  means oxygen, and also 16. Hence the compound atom or molecule of  water, H_{2}O, weighs 18. I must now show you that these two gases are  possessed of totally different properties. Some gases will extinguish a  flame; some will cause the flame to burn brilliantly, but will not burn  themselves; and some will take fire and burn themselves, though  extinguishing the flame which has ignited them. We say the first are  non-combustible, and will not support combustion; the second are  supporters of combustion, the third are combustible gases. Of course  these are, as the lawyers say, only _ex parte_ statements of the truth;  still they are usually accepted. Oxygen gas will ignite a red-hot match,  but hydrogen will extinguish an inflamed one, though it will itself  burn. You generally think of water as the great antithesis of, the  universal antidote for, fire. The truth is here again only of an _ex  parte_ character, as I will show you. If I can, by means of a substance  having a more intense affinity for oxygen than hydrogen has, rob water  of its oxygen, I necessarily set the hydrogen that was combined with  that oxygen free. If the heat caused by the chemical struggle, so to  say, is great, that hydrogen will be inflamed and burn. Thus we are  destroying that antithesis, we are causing the water to yield us fire. I  will do this by putting potassium on water, and even in the cold this  potassium will seize upon the oxygen of the "]]]
