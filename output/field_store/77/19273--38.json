Let us with double splendor now repeat    That festival, with prizes that shall draw    From all your kingdom and the neighbor states    Their fairest women and their bravest men.    If any chance shall bring his destined mate,    You then shall see love dart from eye to eye,    As darts the lightning's flash from cloud to cloud.\"    And this seemed good, and so was ordered done.      The king to all his kingdom couriers sent,    And to the neighbor states, inviting all    To a great festival and royal games    The next full moon, day of Siddartha's birth,    And offering varied prizes, rich and rare,    To all in feats of strength and speed and skill,    And prizes doubly rich and doubly rare    To all such maidens fair as should compete    In youth and beauty, whencesoe'er they came,    The prince to be the judge and give the prize.      Now all was joy and bustle in the streets,    And joy and stir in palace and in park,    The prince himself joining the joyful throng,    Forgetting now the sorrows of the world.    Devising and directing new delights    Until the park became a fairy scene.      Behind the palace lay a maidan wide    For exercise in arms and manly sports,    Its sides bordered by gently rising hills,    Where at their ease the city's myriads sat    Under the shade of high-pruned spreading trees,    Fanned by cool breezes from the snow-capped peaks;    While north, and next the lake, a stately dome    Stood out, on slender, graceful columns raised,    With seats, rank above rank, in order placed,    The throne above, and near the throne were bowers    Of slender lattice-work, with trailing vines,    Thick set with flowers of every varied tint,    Breathing perfumes, where beauty's champions    Might sit, unseen of all yet seeing all.      At length Siddartha's natal day arrives    With joy to rich and poor, to old and young---    Not joy that wealth can buy or power command,    But real joy, that springs from real love,    Love to the good old king and noble prince.      When dawning day tinges with rosy light    The snow-capped peaks of Himalaya's chain,    The people are astir.  In social groups,    The old and young, companions, neighbors, friends,    Baskets well filled, they choose each vantage-ground,    Until each hill a sea of faces shows,    A sea of sparkling joy and rippling mirth.      At trumpet-sound all eyes are eager turned    Up toward the palace gates, now open wide,    From whence a gay procession issues forth,    A chorus of musicians coming first,    And next the prince mounted on Kantaka;    Then all the high-born, youth in rich attire,    Mounted on prancing steeds with trappings gay;    And then the good old king, in royal state,    On his huge elephant, white as the snow,    Surrounded by his aged counselors,    Some on their chargers, some in litters borne,    Their long white beards floating in every breeze;    And next, competitors for every prize:    Twelve archers, who could pierce the lofty swans    Sailing from feeding-grounds by distant seas    To summer nests by Thibet's marshy lakes,    Or hit the whirring pheasant as it flies--    For in this peaceful reign they did not make    Men targets for their art, and armor-joints    The marks through which to pierce and kill;    Then wrestlers, boxers, those who hurl the quoit,    And runners fleet, both lithe and light of limb;    And then twelve mighty spearmen, who could pierce    The fleeing boar or deer or fleet gazelle;    Then chariots, three horses yoked to each,    The charioteers in Persian tunics clad,    Arms bare, legs bare--all were athletes in power,    In form and race each an Apollo seemed;    Yoked to the first were three Nisaean steeds,[14]    Each snowy white, proud stepping, rangy, tall,    Chests broad, legs clean and strong, necks arched and high,    With foreheads broad, and eyes large, full and mild,    A race that oft Olympic prizes won,    And whose descendants far from Iran's plains    Bore armored knights in battle's deadly shock    On many bloody European fields;    Then three of ancient Babylonian stock,[15]    Blood bay and glossy as rich Tyrian silk--    Such horses Israel's sacred prophets saw    Bearing their conquerors in triumph home,    A race for ages kept distinct and pure,    Fabled from Alexander's charger sprung;    Then three from distant desert Tartar steppes,    Ewe-necked, ill-favored creatures, lank and gaunt,    That made the people laugh as they passed by--    Who ceased to laugh when they had run the race--    Such horses bore the mighty Mongol hosts[16]    That with the cyclone's speed swept o'er the earth;    Then three, one gray, one bay, one glossy black,    Descended from four horses long since brought    By love-sick chief from Araby the blest,    Seeking with such rare gifts an Indian bride,    Whose slender, graceful forms, compact and light,    Combined endurance, beauty, strength and speed--    A wondrous breed, whose famed descendants bore    The Moslem hosts that swept from off the earth    Thy mighty power, corrupt, declining Rome,    And with each other now alone contend    In speed, whose sons cast out, abused and starved,    Alone can save from raging whirlwind flames[17]    That all-devouring sweep our western plains;    Then stately elephants came next in line,    With measured step and gently swaying gait,    Covered with cloth of gold richly inwrought,    Each bearing in a howdah gaily decked    A fair competitor for beauty's prize,    With merry comrades and some sober friend;    The vina, bansuli, sitar and harp    Filling the air with sweetest melody,    While rippling laughter from each howdah rang,    And sweetest odors, as from op'ning flowers,    Breathed from their rich apparel as they passed.      And thus they circle round the maidan wide,    And as they pass along the people shout,    \"Long live the king! long live our noble prince!\"    To all which glad acclaims the prince responds    With heartfelt courtesy and royal grace.      When they had nearly reached the palace gate    On their return, the king drew to the right    With his attendants, while the prince with his    Drew to the left, reviewing all the line    That passed again down to the judges' seat,    Under the king's pavilion near the lake.    The prince eagerly watched them as they passed,    Noting their brawny limbs and polished arms,    The pose and skill of every charioteer,    The parts and varied breed of every horse,    Aiding his comrades with his deeper skill.    But when the queens of beauty passed him by,    He was all smiles and gallantry and grace,    Until the last, Yasodhara, came near,    Whose laugh was clearest of the merry crowd,    Whose golden hair imprisoned sunlight seemed,    Whose cheek, blending the lily with the rose,    Spoke of more northern skies and Aryan blood,    Whose rich, not gaudy, robes exquisite taste    Had made to suit her so they seemed a part    Of her sweet self; whose manner, simple, free,    Not bold or shy, whose features--no one saw    Her features, for her soul covered her face    As with a veil of ever-moving life.    When she came near, and her bright eyes met his,    He seemed to start; his gallantry was gone,    And like an awkward boy he sat and gazed;    And her laugh too was hushed, and she passed on,    Passed out of sight but never out of mind,    The king and all his counselors saw this.    \"Good king, our deer is struck,\" Asita said,    \"If this love cure him not, nothing can cure.\"      [1]Lieutenant-General Briggs, in his lectures on the aboriginal races  of India, says the Hindoos themselves refer the excavation of caves and  temples to the period of the aboriginal kings.

Buddha taught the middle course of  diligence in daily duties and universal love.    [13]I am aware that some Buddhist authors whom Arnold has followed in  his \"Light of Asia\" make Buddha but little better than a stale  prisoner, and would have us believe that the glimpses he got of the  ills that flesh is heir to were gained in spite of all precautions, as  he was occasionally taken out of his rose embowered, damsel filled  prison-house, and not as any prince of high intelligence and tender  sensibilities who loved his people and mingled freely with them would  gain a knowledge of suffering and sorrow; but we are justified in  passing all such fancies, not only on account of their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14366"],[0,"Argentina from a British Point of View, and Notes on Argentine Life (#5)"],[1,"Flour     ... |     50,597  5,407,119         80   809,479   119,440                    |  Oatmeal and       |    Rolled Oats ... |      --       183,334      --      207,516     --                    |  Farinaceous sub-  |    stances (except |    Starch, Farina, |    Dextrine, and   |    Potato Flour)   |      --        99,112      --       59,302     --                    |  Bran and Pollard  |     11,932       --         --        --        --                    |  Sharps and        |    Middlings       |     35,113       --         --        --        --                    |  Maize Meal        |       --       129,543      --        --        --                ----+-----------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------                   L 20,284,228 | 19,523,587 | 7,317,626 | 7,823,090 | 2,524,773                ----------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------  Percentage             28.53% |    27.46%  |  10.29%   | 11.00%    | 3.56%                ----------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------             *       *       *       *       *         Other   Colonies and      Foreign        Total.

We see that Argentina  supplies England with one-fourth of her imported food, and U.S.A.  supplies nearly one-third. Therefore it behoves both England and  Argentina to see that America does not so manipulate things that she  acquires the control over our meat and food supplies.    Argentine authorities should not only exercise the law sanctioned  February 4th, 1907, concerning the inspection of factories, but they  should enforce greater care in seeing that all Argentine saladeros and  packing-houses are manipulated with intense care, and cleanliness should  be insisted upon; it would be a bad day for Argentina should ever such  an outcry be raised against her saladeros as that which a few years ago  was directed against the North American packing houses and for a time  ruined the canning industry of the United States, and yet we find  American methods being introduced into Argentina without let or  hindrance. If our soldiers and sailors are to be fed upon canned meats,  let those who are responsible for purchasing the food, at least see that  the food is prepared under healthy and sanitary conditions.    The corn-growing industry of the Argentine Republic is an intensely  interesting subject. Before railways and steamships brought the foreign  producer into close competition with our own farmers, Argentina did not  produce enough grain to supply her home consumption, and cattle were  bred only for their hides, tallow and bones. In the course of time, when  steamers superseded sailing-ships and the world's carrying capacity  thus became enormously increased, Argentina saw her opportunity of  becoming a keen competitor in the food market. Corn-growing became a  highly remunerative business, although much still remains to be learned  concerning the handling of wheat. Both in the States and Canada grain is  handled in a cheaper and more expeditious manner than in Argentina. An  enormous amount of grain is dealt with in the Wheat Exchange of  Winnipeg, but a further big impetus will be given to this industry when  the wheat-fields of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba are connected  with a deep-sea port on Hudson Bay; this will be an accomplished fact in  1915, and as this route means a thousand miles less haulage by land, and  eight hundred less by sea to the chief European ports than by any  existing route, it is bound to become the popular one; the chief factor,  however, in making it a useful wheat outlet is the established fact that  Hudson Bay, although many miles north of Lake Superior, remains free  from ice for a period of one month after Lake Superior is tightly frozen  up.    Argentina may look forward to keen competition with Canada and Siberia  for many years to come; on the other hand, the U.S.A. will steadily show  a smaller quantity of wheat available for exportation, and the following  table throws some light upon the wheat position:--    Argentina and Uruguay have increased    the area of their wheat-growing    land brought under the plough in    the last ten years by                      124 per cent.  Canada in the last ten years by              120 per cent.  Russia in the last ten years by               27 per cent.  United States in the last ten years by        14 per cent.    No country in the world has shown such wonderful capabilities for  growing linseed as the Argentine, and her average production for the  following five-year periods show this expansion:--    Years.        Production in Tons.  1894-1898           193,000  1899-1903           382,000  1904-1908           839,000    In ten years she increased her production by 335 per cent. In the same  period India increased her production by 3.8 per cent., and North  America by 105 per cent., whilst Russia was unable to keep up her  supply.    The world's total linseed production for 1908 was made up as follows:--    Argentina      produced 1,101,000 tons.  North America  produced   694,000 tons.  Russia         produced   470,000 tons.  India          produced   360,000 tons.    Here again we find Argentina leading. Moreover, she exported nearly the  whole of her production, whilst North America, Russia, and India  exported less than half a million tons between them.    It is more than probable that by 1920 Argentina will be able to export,  as the result of agricultural work, more than L100,000,000 worth of  produce per annum. It is interesting to note that, as the present  figures reveal, allowing for a population of 6,500,000 and an  agricultural produce export of L48,335,432, each individual in Argentina  has sent abroad, after producing enough from the land to keep himself,  goods to the value of nearly L8.    The diagram facing this page shows what has been accomplished by  Argentina in the last ten years.    [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF VALUE IN L STERLING OF THE TOTAL EXPORTS OF  ARGENTINA 1900-1909.]    In actual money value the exportation of wheat, linseed, oats, maize,  other grain, flour, bran, and middlings is, in round figures, as  follows:--    1900   L15,485,000  1901    14,319,000  1902    13,634,000  1903    21,050,000  1904    30,065,000  1905    34,047,000  1906    31,530,000  1907    32,818,000  1908    48,335,000  1909    46,100,000    CATTLE.    The value derived from the cattle industry and its allied produce is of  great importance to the Argentine Republic. The exports from this  industry may be divided into four heads, namely:--    LIVE ANIMALS;    RAW PRODUCTS;    MANUFACTURED OR PARTLY MANUFACTURED MATERIAL AND BY-PRODUCTS.    Since the closing of English ports in 1901 to the importation of live  cattle from Argentina, the trade in the export of live stock has fallen  off considerably; the total value did not in 1908 amount to more than  L568,966; Belgium took 65,224 sheep, Chili took 45,114 cattle and 14,394  sheep, Bolivia took 3,383 head of cattle and 10,676 sheep, and 16,000  asses and mules, while horses were imported into England, Africa,  Portugal, Brazil, Uruguay, Chili, Bolivia, and Paraguay.    Exports of raw products, which include frozen and chilled beef and  mutton, hides, sheepskins, wool, and such things as horsehair, tallow,  jerked beef, etc., represented a value of L19,549,231 in 1908.    Manufactured or partly manufactured material, including prepared tallow,  meat extracts, meat, butter, cheese, lard, dressed leather, etc.,  represented L2,454,760, whilst the by-products, including bones, dried  blood, guano, waste fats, etc., were valued at L430,734. Thus,  Argentina's total export from the cattle industry (after supplying her  own needs) was over L23,000,000.    Argentina's live stock on hand when the last census was taken in May,  1908, was as follows:--    Cattle ... ... ... 29,116,625  Sheep  ... ... ... 67,211,758  Horses ... ... ...  7,531,376  Mules, swine,  goats, and asses    6,098,802    representing in value L129,369,628.    The favourite breed of cattle is the Shorthorn, and they comprise 84 per  cent, of the classified breeding cows; the Herefords only figure out as  6 per cent., but, undoubtedly, a more careful and complete  classification will lead to modifications in these figures, for at the  present time no less than five and a-half million cows are returned as  Criollo cattle, in other words, unimproved stock.    Not until the year 1885, when it became possible to send frozen meat to  Europe, did estancieros pay serious attention to growing cattle for meat  production, and now, with an ever-increasing quantity of land being  placed under alfalfa, the Argentine Republic is fast becoming the  leading factor in the production of meat to satisfy the world's  consumption.    Cattle on the outside fringe of occupied lands are still very coarse and  rough, with a distinct strain of the Hereford about them; they are,  however, a useful herd and most suitable for the districts they"]]]
