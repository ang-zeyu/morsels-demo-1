This is the great change to which the Brahmanas bear witness. They show  no marked departure from the theology of the Vedas, though many of the  old gods continue to be dethroned either to disappear altogether, or to  reappear in new shapes, like Varuna, who turns into a god of night to be  worshipped no longer for his beneficence, but to be placated for his  cruelty; whilst, on the other hand, Prajapati is raised to the highest  throne, with Sun, Air, and Fire in close attendance. What the Brahmanas  do show is that the Brahman has acquired the overwhelming authority of a  sacerdotal status, not vested merely in the learning of a theologian,  but in some special attribute of his blood, and therefore transmissible  only from father to son. The Brahman was doubtless helped to this  fateful pre-eminence by the modifications which the popular tongue had  undergone in the course of time, and as the result more especially of  migration from the Punjab to the Gangetic plains. The language of the  Vedic hymns had ceased to be understood by the masses, and its  interpretation became the monopoly of learned families; and this  monopoly, like all others, was used by those who enjoyed it for their  own aggrandisement. The language that had passed out of common usage  acquired an added sanctity. It became a sacred language, and sacred  became the Brahman, who alone possessed the key to it, who alone could  recite its sacred texts and perform the rites which they prescribed, and  select the prayers which could best meet every distinct and separate  emergency in the life of man.    In the Brahmanas we can follow the growth of a luxuriant theology for  the use of the masses which, in so far as it was polytheistic, tended to  the infinite multiplication of gods and goddesses and godlings of all  types, and in so far as it was pantheistic invested not only men, but  beasts and insects and rivers and fountains and trees and stones with  some living particle of the divine essence pervading all things; and we  can follow there also the erection on the basis of that theology, of a  formidable ritual of which the exclusive exercise and the material  benefits were the appanage of the Brahman. But we have to turn to a  later collection of writings known as the Upanishads for our knowledge  of the more abstract speculations out of which Hindu thinkers, not  always of the Brahmanical caste, were concurrently evolving the esoteric  systems of philosophy that have exercised an immense and abiding  influence on the spiritual life of India. There is the same difficulty  in assigning definite dates to the Upanishads, though many of the later  ones bear the post-mark of the various periods of theological evolution  with which they coincided. Only some of the earliest ones are held by  many competent authorities to be, in the shape in which they have  reached us, anterior to the time when India first becomes, in any real  sense, historical; but there is no reason to doubt that they represent  the progressive evolution into different forms of very ancient germs  already present in the Vedas themselves. They abound in the same  extravagant eclecticism, leading often to the same confusions and  contradictions that Hindu theology presents. The Sankhya Darshana, or  system, recognising only a primary material cause from which none but  finite beings can proceed, regards the universe and all that exists in  it and life itself as a finite illusion of which the end is  non-existence, and its philosophic conceptions are atheistic rather than  pantheistic. In opposition to it the Vedantic system of mystic  pantheism, whilst also seeing in this finite world a mere world of  illusion, holds that rescue from it will come to each individual soul  after a more or less prolonged series of rebirths, determined for better  or for worse by its own spirituality according to the law of Karma, not  in non-existence, but in its fusion with God, whose identity with the  soul of man is merely temporarily obscured by the world illusion of  Maya. Only the inconceivable is real, for it is God, but God dwells in  the heart of every man, who, if and when he can realise it and has  detached himself from his unworthy because unreal surroundings, is  himself God. Akin to Vedantic mysticism is the Yoga system, which  teaches extreme asceticism, retirement into solitude, fastings, nudity,  mortification of the flesh, profound meditation on unfathomable  mysteries, and the endless reiteration of magic words and phrases as the  means of accelerating that ineffable fusion of God and man. The  materialism of the Sankhya and the idealism of the Vedanta combine to  provoke the reaction of yet another system, the Mimansa, which stands  for the eternal and divine revelation of the Vedas, codifies, so to say,  their theology into liturgical laws, admits of no speculation or  esoteric interpretation, and seems to subordinate the gods themselves  to the forms of worship that consecrate their existence.    Of all the doctrines that these early speculations evolved, none has had  a more enduring influence on Hinduism than that of the long and indeed  infinite succession of rebirths through which man is doomed to pass  before he reaches the ultimate goal either of non-existence or of  absorption into the divine essence. For none has done more to fortify  the patriarchal principle which from the earliest times governed the  tribal family, and to establish the Hindu conception of the family as it  prevails to the present day. With that curious inconsequence which  frequently characterises Hindu thought, even when it professes to be  ruled by the sternest logic, the belief that every rebirth is  irrevocably determined by the law of Karma, _i.e._ in accordance with  the sum total of man's deeds, good and bad, in earlier existences, is  held to be compatible with the belief that the felicity of the dead can  only be assured by elaborate rites of worship and sacrifice, which a son  alone, or a son's son, can take over from his father and properly  perform. The ancient _patria potestas_ of tribal institutions has been  thus prolonged beyond the funeral pyre, and the ancient reverence for  the dead which originally found expression in an instinctive worship of  the ancestors has been translated into a ceremonial cult of the  ancestral manes, which constitutes the primary duty and function of  every new head of the family. Hence the Hindu joint family system which  keeps the whole property of the family as well as the governance of all  its members under the sole control of the head of the family. Hence also  the necessity of early marriage, lest death should overtake the Hindu  before he has begotten the son upon whose survival the performance of  the rites essential, not only to his own future felicity, but to that of  all his ancestors depends, and, as an alternative, to mitigate the awful  consequences of the default of heirs male of his own body, the  introduction of adoption under conditions that secure to the adopted  son precisely the same position as a real son would have enjoyed. Hence  again the inferiority of woman, whom early marriage tended to place in  complete subjection to man. Her chief value was that of a potential  breeder of sons. In any case, moreover, she passed on her marriage  entirely out of her own family into that of her husband, and terribly  hard was her lot if she were left a widow before having presented her  husband with a son. Even if she were left an infant widow of an infant  husband and their marriage could not possibly have been consummated, she  was doomed to an austere and humiliating life of perpetual widowhood,  whilst, on the other hand, if she died, her widowed husband was enjoined  to marry again at once unless she had left him a son. To explain away  this cruel injustice, her fate was supposed to be due to her own Karma,  and to be merely the retribution that had overtaken her for sins  committed in a former existence, which condemned her to be born a woman  and to die a childless wife, or worse still, to survive as a childless  widow. The misfortune of the widowed husband who was left without a son  should logically have been imputed in the same way to his own Karma, but  it was not. All through life, and in death itself, man was exalted and  woman occupied a much lower plane, though in practice this hardship was  mitigated for the women who bore sons by the reverence paid to them in  their homes, where their force of character and their virtues often gave  them a great and recognised ascendancy. However hard the laws that  governed the Hindu family might press on individual members, the family  itself remained a living organism, united by sacred ties--indeed more  than a mere living organism, for the actually living organism was one  with that part of it which had already passed away and that which was  still awaiting rebirth. It is undoubtedly in the often dignified and  beautiful relations which bind the Hindu family together that Hinduism  is seen at its best, and Hindu literature delights in describing and  exalting them.    Traditional usages, or Smriti, were ultimately embodied in codes of law,  of which the most famous is that of Manu; and though disfigured by many  social servitudes repugnant to the Western mind, they represent a lofty  standard of morality based upon a conception of duty, or Dharma,  narrowly circumscribed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15604"],[0,"Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers (#5)"],[1,"one. At a recent rehearsal with the  Symphony Orchestra, I told the men I would quietly run through the  concerto I was to play, merely indicating the effects I wanted. We  began, but in five minutes I found myself playing with full force and  vigor.    \"In regard to methods in piano study there seems to be a diversity of  opinion, resulting, I think, from the various ways of touching the  keys--some players using the tip and others the ball of the finger.  Busoni may be cited as one who employs the end of the finger--Pauer  also; while the Frenchman, Cortot, who has an exquisite tone, plays with  the hand almost flat on the keys, a method which certainly insures  weight of hand and arm. Of course players generally, and teachers also,  agree on the employment of arm weight in playing. The principles of  piano technic are surely but few. Was it not Liszt who said: 'Play the  right key with the right finger, the right tone and the right  intention--that is all!' It seems to me piano technic has been pushed to  its limit, and there must be a reversal; we may return to some of the  older methods of touch and technic.    \"The vital thing in piano playing is to bring out the composer's  meaning, plus your own inspiration and feeling. You must study deeply  into the composer's idea, but you must also put your own feeling,  intensity and emotion into the piece. And not only must you feel the  meaning yourself, but you must play it in a way to touch others. There  are many pianists who are not cultured musicians; who think they know  their Beethoven because they can play a few sonatas. In music 'knowledge  is power.' We need all possible knowledge, but we also need to feel the  inspiration. One of the greatest teachers of our time holds that  personal inspiration is not necessary; for the feeling is all in the  music itself. All we have to do is to play with such and such a dynamic  quality of tone. Like a country doctor measuring out his drugs, this  master apportions so many grains of power for _forte_, for _mezzo_, for  _piano_, and so on. This plan puts a damper on individuality and  enthusiasm, for it means that everything must be coldly calculated. Such  playing does not really warm the heart.    \"I believe in teaching tonal contrasts and tone color even to a  beginner. Why should not the child form a concept of _forte_ and  _piano_, and so get away from the deadly monotony of _mezzo_? I have  written some little descriptive piano pieces, and my small boy learned  one of them to play for me. There is a closing phrase like this,\" and  Mr. Ganz illustrated at the piano; \"it is to be played _forte_, and is  followed by a few notes to be touched very softly, like an echo. It was  really beautiful to see how the little fellow reached out for the pedal  to make the loud part more emphatic, and then played the echo very  softly and neatly. He had grasped the first principle of tone  color--namely tone contrast, and also a poetic idea.    \"There are so many wonder children in these days, and many marvels are  accomplished by infant prodigies. Very often however, these wonder  children develop no further; they fail to fulfil their early promise, or  the expectations held of them.    \"A youthful wonder in the field of composition is Eric Korngold, whose  piano sonata I played in my New York recital. I have played this work  eight times in all, during my present tour, often by request. To me it  is most interesting. I cannot say it is logical in the development of  its ideas; it often seems as though the boy threw in chords here and  there with no particular reason. Thus the effort of memorizing is  considerable, for I must always bear in mind that this C major chord has  a C sharp in it, or that such and such a chord is changed into a most  unusual one. One cannot predict whether the boy will develop further. As  you say, Mozart was an infant prodigy, but if we judge from the first  little compositions that have been preserved, he began very simply and  worked up, whereas Korngold begins at Richard Strauss. His compositions  are full of the influence of Strauss. The critics have much to say for  and against these early works. I do not know the young composer  personally, though he has written me. In a recent letter which I have  here, he expresses the thought that, though the critics have found many  things to disapprove of in the sonata, the fact that I have found it  worth studying and bringing out more than compensates him for all  adverse criticism. To make the work known in the great musical centers  of America is surely giving it wide publicity.\"    On a later occasion, Mr. Ganz said:    \"I thoroughly believe in preserving one's enthusiasm for modern music,  even though, at first glance, it does not attract one, or indeed seems  almost impossible. I enjoy studying new works, and learning what is the  modern trend of thought in piano work; it keeps me young and buoyant.    \"One of the novelties lately added to my repertoire is the Haydn sonata  in D. On the same program I place the Korngold sonata. A hundred years  and more divide the two works. While I revere the old, it interests me  to keep abreast of the new thought in musical art and life.\"          VI    TINA LERNER    AN AUDIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER      Between the many engagements that crowded upon the close of her long  American tour, Miss Tina Lerner found time to talk over certain topics  of significance which bear upon pianistic problems.    We began by referring to the different methods of holding the hands,  moving the fingers and touching the keys, as exemplified by the various  pianists now before the public.    \"It is true that I play with the ball of the finger on the key, which  necessitates a flat position of hand, with low wrist.\" Here the pianist  illustrated the point by playing several pearly scales with straight,  outstretched fingers. \"I never realized, however, that I played in this  way, until Mr. Ernest Hutcheson, the pianist, of Baltimore, recently  called my attention to it. The fact is, I have always taken positions of  body, arms, hands and fingers, which seemed to me the most natural and  easy. This I did when I began, at the age of five, and I have always  kept to them, in spite of what various teachers have endeavored to do  for me. Fortunately my early teachers were sensible and careful; they  kept me at the classics, and did not give too difficult pieces. The  principles followed by most great pianists I believe are correct; but I  have always kept to my own natural way. In hand position, therefore, I  am individual; perhaps no one else plays with such a finger position, so  in this I am unique.    \"For some reason unknown to me, it has come to be imagined that I have  studied with Leschetizky; this is entirely refuted when I say I have  never been in Vienna. It seems we are getting away from the idea of  helping ourselves out with the name of some great teacher. The question  should be: What has the player in himself, what can he accomplish? not,  Whose pupil is he? We know of some of Leschetizky's famous pupils, but  we never hear of the thousands he must have had, who have come to  nothing. A teacher can only do a certain amount for you; he can give you  new ideas, which each pupil works out for himself in his own way. The  piano student learns from so many different sources. He attends a piano  recital and acquires many ideas of touch, tone, phrasing and  interpretation; he hears a great singer or violinist and absorbs a  wholly new set of thoughts, or he listens to a grand orchestra, and  gains more than from all the others. Then there is life to study from:  experience--living--loving: all go into the work of the musician. A  musical career is indeed the most exacting one that can be chosen.    \"I have been asked whether I prefer to play for an audience of  'music-lovers' or one of 'music knowers.' Perhaps an equal mixture is  the happy medium. Of the two sorts it seems to me the music-knowers are  preferable, for even if they are very critical, they also recognize the  various points you make; they see and appreciate what you are striving  for. They are not inclined to say, 'I don't like such or such a player';  for the music-knower understands the vast amount of time and energy,  labor and talent that go to make a pianist. He rather says, 'I prefer  the playing of such or such an artist.' The word 'like' in connection  with a great artist seems almost an affront. What does it matter if his  work is not 'liked' by some? He knows it can stand for what it is--the  utmost perfection of his powers--of himself. And after all the audience  is the greatest teacher an artist can have; I have learned more from  this teacher than from any other. In this school I learn what moves and  touches an audience; how to improve this or that passage; how to make a  greater climax here, or more sympathetic coloring there. For in  conceiving how a work should sound, I get--in my study of it--a general  idea of the whole, and make it as nearly perfect as I am able. But it  has to be tested and tried--an audience must pass its opinion--must set  the seal of approval upon it. When the work has been polished by  repeated trials in this school, interpretation then becomes crystallized  in the mind and the piece can always be given in nearly the same way. A  painter does not change nor repaint his picture each time he exhibits  it; why need the musician change his idea of the interpretation at each  repetition? To trust too much to the inspiration of the moment might  injure the performance as a whole. When I have my ideal of the  interpretation worked out in mind, it becomes my sacred duty to play it  always in this spirit--always to give my best. I can never think that  because I am playing in Boston or New York, I must strive harder for  perfection than if I play in a little town. No, I must give the highest  that is in me, no matter where it"]]]
