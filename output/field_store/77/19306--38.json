Please tell us another?\" cried a chorus of young  voices.    Mrs. Travilla drew out her watch, and holding it up with a smile, \"Not  just now, my dears,\" she said, \"see it is almost tea-time, and,\" she  added playfully, \"some of us have need to change our dresses and smooth  our tangled tresses.\"    \"That is true,\" said Lucy, rising hastily, \"and I expect my husband home.  I must send the carriage off at once to the depot; for the train is nearly  due.\"    Thereupon a cry was raised among the Rosses as they flew after their  mother, \"I want to go for papa!\" \"and I!\" \"It's my turn, I say, and I will  go!\" \"No, you shan't, for it's mine.\"          CHAPTER FIFTH.        \"She fed me first to God;       Her words and prayers were my young spirit's dew.\"                                             --PIERPONT.      \"Hallo! this looks like welcome; every one of you been crying!\" Mr. Ross  said, catching up Sophie in his arms, and glancing about upon his group of  children, after an affectionate greeting to his wife, and a cordially kind  one to their guest.    \"What's the trouble? so sorry papa was coming home, eh?\"    \"No, no, that wasn't it, papa,\" they cried, crowding around him, each  eager to claim the first caress, \"it wasn't that, but we wanted to go for  you, and mamma wouldn't let us.\"    \"Yes,\" said Lucy, \"they all wanted to go and as that couldn't be, and no  one would give up to the others, I kept them all at home.\"    \"Quite right,\" he said, gravely, \"I'm afraid you hardly deserve the pretty  gifts I have brought.\"    \"Oh, yes, yes, papa, we'll be good next time! Indeed we will! Mamma, coax  him!\"    \"Yes, do let them have them, Phil,\" urged his wife, \"where would be the  use of keeping the things back after spending your money for them?\"    \"To teach them a good lesson. I'm afraid both you and I are foolishly  indulgent, Lucy.\"    \"Oh, they'll be good next time.\"    \"This once then, but only this once, unless they keep their word,\" he  said, producing his gifts--a book or toy for each of his own children, and  a package of sweetmeats which he divided among all present.    He had brought a new dog home with him, but no one but Eddie had noticed  it yet. He was stroking and patting it, saying, \"Poor fellow, what kind of  a dog are you?\"    \"A French poodle,\" said Mr. Ross, coming up to them, \"A good watch dog,  and excellent for scaring up the wild ducks for the sportsmen. Do you and  papa keep up the shooting lessons, master Eddie?\"    \"Yes, sir; papa has always said he meant to make me as good a shot as  himself, and mamma says it was never his way to give up till a thing's  thoroughly done,\" returned the boy, proudly.    \"And you don't equal him as a shot yet, eh?\"    \"No, sir! no, indeed! Why, even cousin Cal Conly--a big man--can't shoot  as well as papa.\"    \"What an ugly dog!\" exclaimed the other children, gathering round.    \"What did you buy it for, papa?\" asked Gertrude.    \"Not for beauty, certainly,\" laughed Mr. Ross, stroking and patting the  shaggy head of the dog, who was covered with curly hair of a dirty white,  mottled with dull brown, \"but for worth which is far better. Isn't it,  Ranger?\"    A wag of his bushy tail, was Ranger's only reply.    \"Will he bite?\" asked little Herbert, shrinking back as the newcomer  turned toward him.    \"Tramps and burglars; but not good children,\" replied Mr. Ross. \"You  needn't be afraid of him, my little man.\"    Through the evening there was a great deal of romping between the children  and the new dog, but little Elsie seemed unusually quiet, scarcely  stirring from her mother's side. She was suffering with toothache, but  kept her trouble to herself; principally, because she had a great dread of  the dentist's instruments.    But in the night the pain grew so severe that she could not keep from  crying and groaning. She did not want to wake any one, so buried her face  in the pillow to smother the sound of her sobs; but presently a gentle  hand touched her caressingly, and mamma's sweet voice asked, \"What ails my  little daughter?\"    \"O mamma I did not mean to wake you!\" cried the little girl sitting up  with her hand pressed to her cheek, \"but the pain was so bad I couldn't  help making a noise.\"    \"My poor dear little girl! did you think your mother would want to sleep  when her child was in pain?\" Elsie said, clasping her in her arms. \"No,  indeed! so do not try to bear any pain alone another time.\"    Mamma's loving sympathy was very sweet; the pain was soon relieved, too,  by some medicine she put into the tooth, and presently all was forgotten  in sound refreshing sleep.    Elsie came into her mamma's dressing-room the next morning, along with the  others, looking as bright and well as was her wont, yet with the boding  fear that something would be said to her about having the troublesome  tooth extracted.    However to her relief the subject was not broached at all; they had their  usual reading and prayer, recitation of texts and talk with mamma about  the lessons contained in them, and then the breakfast bell summoned them  to their morning meal.    The tooth was quiet for a few days, then ached again for several hours  harder than ever.    \"O mamma, mamma, what shall I do?\" sobbed the child in the midst of her  pain.    \"Couldn't my little girl pluck up courage enough to have it out?\" asked  the mother tenderly.    \"O mamma, don't say I must! please don't; I'm so frightened at the very  thought!\"    \"Ah, if I could only bear it for you, my darling! but you know I cannot.\"    \"No, dear mamma, and I couldn't be so selfish as to let you, if you could.  But must I have it out?\"    \"I have not said so; I should far rather my dear daughter would say must  to herself.\"    \"Ought I, mamma?\"    \"Ought you not? The tooth has become only a source of pain and trouble to  you; if left it will cause the others to decay, and decayed teeth injure  the health. Health is one of God's best gifts and it is our duty to use  every means in our power to preserve it.\"    \"Yes, mamma, but oh, I'm so afraid!\" cried the child, trembling and  weeping.    \"My darling, resolve to do your duty with God's help, and he will fulfill  his promise to you. 'As thy days so shall thy strength be.'\"    Little Elsie had long ago given her heart to Jesus; love to him was the  ruling motive of her life, and to please and honor him she was ready to do  or endure anything. \"I will try, mamma,\" she said, \"and you too will ask  God to help me?\"    Mamma gave the promise, sealing it with a very tender kiss.    Mr. Ross was going down to New York the next morning, and it was soon  arranged that his wife, Mrs. Travilla and little Elsie, should accompany  him.    Mrs. Ross had some shopping to do, but would first take the two Elsies to  her dentist, so that the little girl's trial might be over as soon as  possible and she able to enjoy some sight-seeing afterward. Baby Lily was  better and could be safely entrusted for the day to Aunt Chloe's faithful  care.    The plan was concealed from the Ross children because, as their mother  said, \"it was the only way to have any peace.\" So they were allowed to  sleep until the travelers had taken an early breakfast and gone.    The little Travillas, however, were up and saw the departure, bidding a  cheerful good-bye to \"mamma and sister Elsie,\" sending wistful, longing  looks after the carriage as it rolled away, but making no complaint that  they were left behind.    \"Poor dear Elsie!\" Vi said with tears in her eyes, \"it's just dreadful  that she must have that tooth extricated.\"    \"Extracted,\" corrected Eddie. \"Vi, you seem to forget what mamma  says:--that you should never use a big word unless you are sure you have  it right; or when a little one would do as well.\"    \"What little one?\"    \"Pulled.\"    \"Couldn't it be pulled and not come out?\"    \"Well then you might say pulled out.\"    \"I like the other word best,\" persisted Vi. \"But we needn't be particular  about words when Elsie's going to be so dreadfully hurt.\"    Herbert burst out crying at that.    \"Why Herbie what ails you?\" asked Vi, putting her arms round his neck and  giving him a kiss.    \"I don't want the mans to hurt my Elsie,\" sobbed the little fellow, \"maybe  dey'll kill her.\"    \"Oh, no, they won't! mamma will never let them do that. They'll only take  away the naughty tooth that hurts her so.\"    \"Come let's go and walk round the garden,\" said Eddie, taking Herbie's  hand, \"mamma said we might.\"    The breakfast bell called them in to find the Rosses making a perfect  bedlam in their anger and disappointment at being left behind by their  parents. Sophie was screaming and stamping with rage, the boys and Kate  were whimpering and scolding, and Gertrude walking about with flashing  eyes, was saying \"I'll never forgive mamma for this, no I never will; for  she'd promised to take me along next time she went to the city.\"    Violet, Eddie, and Harold hearing these words, looked at each other in  horrified silence. \"How could she speak so of her own mother?\"    Miss Fisk came in, in her quiet, deliberate way and stood looking for a  moment from one to another of her pupils in a sort of amazed, reproving  silence that presently had the effect of quieting them down a little. Then  she spoke.    \"Young ladies and young gentlemen, I am astonished! especially at your  expressions and behavior, Miss Gertrude Ross. How you can permit yourself  to indulge in such invectives against parents so extremely indulgent as  Mr. and Mrs. Ross, I cannot conceive.\"    Sophie whose screams had sunk to sobs, now permitted the servant to lift  her to her high chair, Kate and the boys slunk shamefacedly into their  seats at the table, and Gertrude, muttering"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],[0,"McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#5)"],[1,"in prose and verse, and also translated many  from Swedish, Danish, and German authors. This story is arranged from one  in a collection named \"Peter Drake's Dream, and Other Stories.\" She died  in 1888.    1. There were, in very ancient times, two brothers, one of whom was rich,  and the other poor. Christmas was approaching, but the poor man had  nothing in the house for a Christmas dinner; so he went to his brother and  asked him for a trifling gift.    2. The rich man was ill-natured, and when he heard his brother's request  he looked very surly. But as Christmas is a time when even the worst  people give gifts, he took a fine ham down from the chimney, where it was  hanging to smoke, threw it at his brother, and bade him begone and never  to let him see his face again.    3. The poor man thanked his brother for the ham, put it under his arm, and  went his way. He had to pass through a great forest on his way home. When  he had reached the thickest part of it, he saw an old man, with a long,  white beard, hewing timber. \"Good evening,\" said he to him.    4. \"Good evening,\" returned the old man, raising himself up from his work,  and looking at him. \"That is a fine ham you are carrying.\" On this, the  poor man told him all about it.    5. \"It is lucky for you,\" said the old man, \"that you have met with me. If  you will take that ham into the land of the dwarfs, the entrance to which  lies just under the roots of this tree, you can make a capital bargain  with it; for the dwarfs are very fond of ham, and rarely get any. But mind  what I say: you must not sell it for money, but demand for it the 'old  hand mill which stands behind the door.' When you come back, I'll show you  how to use it.\"    6. The poor man thanked his new friend, who showed him the door under a  stone below the roots of the tree, and by this door he entered into the  land of the dwarfs. No sooner had he set his foot in it, than the dwarfs  swarmed about him, attracted by the smell of the ham. They offered him  queer, old-fashioned money and gold and silver ore for it; but he refused  all their tempting offers, and said that he would sell it only for the old  hand mill behind the door.    7. At this, the dwarfs held up their little old hands, and looked quite  perplexed. \"We can not make a bargain, it seems,\" said the poor man, \"so  I'll bid you all a good day.\"    8. The fragrance of the ham had by this time reached the remote parts of  dwarf land. The dwarfs came flocking around in little troops, leaving  their work of digging out precious ores, eager for the ham.    9. \"Let him have the old mill,\" said some of the newcomers; \"it is quite  out of order, and he don't know how to use it. Let him have it, and we  will have the ham.\"    10. So the bargain was made. The poor man took the old hand mill, which  was a little thing not half so large as the ham, and went back to the  woods. Here the old man showed him how to use it. All this had taken up a  great deal of time, and it was midnight before he reached home.    11. \"Where in the world have you been?\" said his wife. \"Here I have been  waiting and waiting, and we have no wood to make a fire, nor anything to  put into the porridge pot for our Christmas supper.\"    12. The house was dark and cold; but the poor man bade his wife wait and  see what would happen. He placed the little hand mill on the table, and  began to turn the crank. First, out there came some grand, lighted wax  candles, and a fire on the hearth, and a porridge pot boiling over it,  because in his mind he said they should come first. Then he ground out a  tablecloth, and dishes, and spoons, and knives and forks.    13. He was himself astonished at his good luck, as you may believe; and  his wife was almost beside herself with joy and astonishment. Well, they  had a capital supper; and after it was eaten, they ground out of the mill  every possible thing to make their house and themselves warm and  comfortable. So they had a merry Christmas eve and morning.    DEFINITIONS.--l. Tri'-fling, of small value. 5. Hand 'mill, a mill turned  by hand. 6. At-tract'ed, drawn to, allured. 7. Perplexed', puzzled. 8.  Fra'grance, sweetness of smell.        IV. WHY THE SEA IS SALT. (32)  (Concluded.)    1. When the people went by the house to church, the next day, they could  hardly believe their eyes. There was glass in the windows instead of a  wooden shutter, and the poor man and his wife, dressed in nice new  clothes, were seen devoutly kneeling in the church.    2. \"There is something very strange in all this,\" said everyone.  \"Something very strange indeed,\" said the rich man, when three days  afterwards he received an invitation from his once poor brother to a grand  feast. And what a feast it was! The table was covered with a cloth as  white as snow, and the dishes were all of silver or gold. The rich man  could not, in his great house, and with all his wealth, set out such a  table.    3. \"Where did you get all these things?\" exclaimed he. His brother told  him all about the bargain he had made with the dwarfs, and putting the  mill on the table, ground out boots and shoes, coats and cloaks,  stockings, gowns, and blankets, and bade his wife give them to the poor  people that had gathered about the house to get a sight of the grand feast  the poor brother had made for the rich one.    4. The rich man, was very envious of his brother's good fortune, and  wanted to borrow the mill, intending--for he was not an honest man--never  to return it again. His brother would not lend it, for the old man with  the white beard had told him never to sell or lend it to anyone.    5. Some years went on, and, at last, the possessor of the mill built  himself a grand castle on a rock by the sea, facing the west. Its windows,  reflecting the golden sunset, could be seen far out from the shore. It  became a noted landmark for sailors. Strangers from foreign parts often  came to see this castle and the wonderful mill of which the most  extraordinary tales were told.    6. At length, a great foreign merchant came, and when he had seen the  mill, inquired whether it would grind salt. Being told that it would, he  wanted to buy it; for he traded in salt, and thought that if he owned it  he could supply all his customers without taking long and dangerous  voyages.    7. The man would not sell it, of course. He was so rich now that he did  not want to use it for himself; but every Christmas he ground out food and  clothes and coal for the poor, and nice presents for the little children.  So he rejected all the offers of the rich merchant. The merchant, however,  determined to have it; he bribed one of the man's servants to let him go  into the castle at night, and he stole the mill and sailed away with it in  triumph.    8. He had scarcely got out to sea, before he determined to set the mill to  work. \"Now, mill, grind salt,\" said he; \"grind salt with all your  might!--salt, salt, and nothing but salt!\" The mill began to grind and the  sailors to fill the sacks; but these were soon full, and in spite of all  that could be done, it began to fill the ship.    9. The dishonest merchant was now very much frightened. What was to be  done? The mill would not stop grinding; and at last the ship was  overloaded, and down it went, making a great whirlpool where it sank. The  ship soon went to pieces; but the mill stands on the bottom of the sea,  and keeps grinding  out \"salt, salt, nothing but salt!\" That is the  reason, say the peasants of Denmark and Norway, why the sea is salt.

EXERCISES.--What is a \"fairy tale\"?  What fairy people are told about in  this story? How did the poor man find the way to the land of the dwarfs?  Do you think the old man would have told him if the poor man had not been  so polite? How did the poor man treat his rich brother in return for his  unkindness? How was the greed of the dishonest merchant punished? What is  meant by \"strangers from foreign parts\"? Where are Denmark and Norway?        V. POPPING CORN. (34)    1. One autumn night, when the wind was high,       And the rain fell in heavy plashes,     A little boy sat by the kitchen fire,       A-popping corn in the ashes;     And his sister, a curly-haired child of three,     Sat looking on, just close to his knee.    2. Pop! pop! and the kernels, one by one,       Came out of the embers flying;     The boy held a long pine stick in his hand,       And kept it busily plying;     He stirred the corn and it snapped the more,     And faster jumped to the clean-swept floor.    3. Part of the kernels flew one way,       And a part hopped out the other;     Some flew plump into the sister's lap,       Some under the stool of the brother;     The little girl gathered them into a heap,     And called them a flock of milk-white sheep.        VI. SMILES. (35)    1. Poor lame Jennie sat at her window, looking out upon the dismal, narrow  street, with a look of pain and weariness on her face. \"Oh, dear,\" she  said with a sigh, \"what a long day this is going to be,\" and she looked  wishfully up the street.    2. Suddenly she leaned forward and pressed her pale face against the  glass, as a rosy-checked boy came racing down the street, swinging his  schoolbooks by the strap. Looking up to the window, he took off his hat  and bowed with a bright, pleasant smile.    3. \"What a nice boy he is,\" said Jennie to herself, as he ran out of  sight. \"I am so glad he goes by here on his way to school. When he smiles,  it seems like having the sun shine. I wish everybody who goes by would  look up and smile.\"    4. \"Mamma,\" said"]]]
