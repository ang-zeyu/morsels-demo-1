So far we had been afraid to breathe a  word of our plans outside of the society, since Fred had said something  about it in the presence of Father and had been peremptorily ordered to  banish all such hair-brained, Wild West notions from his head. We  realized from that incident that the consent of our parents would not be  so very easily obtained. But Bill came forward with a promising  suggestion. He would write to his Uncle Ed and see if he couldn't be  persuaded to join the expedition. At first we demurred. We didn't want a  \"governor\" around all the time. But Bill assured us that his uncle was  \"no ordinary man\"; that he would not interfere with our plans, but would  enter right into them and give us many valuable pointers. Though not by  any means convinced, we told him to go ahead and invite his uncle, as  that seemed about the only means of winning over our fathers and  mothers. The society was then adjourned until our Easter vacation began,  each member promising to earn and save as much money as he could in the  meantime to buy the materials for a tent and provisions for the summer  outing.      Word From Uncle Ed.      [Illustration: Fig. 37. Breadths sewed together for Roof and Side Walls  of Tent.]    Bill's letter to Uncle Ed was answered as quickly as the mail could  travel to Brazil and back. Uncle Ed heartily approved of our plans, and  said that he would be delighted to join the expedition. He could not be  on hand before the 1st of July, but that would give us plenty of time to  make all necessary preparations. He told us not to worry about gaining  the consent of our parents. He would write to them and see them all  personally, if necessary to win their approval.      THE CANVAS TENT.    [Illustration: Fig. 38. The Sail Stitch.]    When at last spring arrived and we returned to Lamington on our Easter  vacation, quite a sum of money had been collected, nearly $15.00, if I  remember rightly; at any rate plenty to buy the materials for a  good-sized tent and leave a large surplus for provisions, etc. Bill  figured out on paper just how much canvas we would need for a tent 7  feet wide by 9-1/2 feet long, which he estimated would be about large  enough to hold us. It took 34 yards, 30 inches wide. Then we visited the  village store to make our purchase. Canvas we found a little too  expensive for us, but a material called drill seemed about right. It  cost ten cents a yard, but since we wanted such a quantity of it the  price was reduced to a total of $3.00. We repaired to the attic to lay  out the material.    [Illustration: Fig. 39. Cutting out the Door Flaps.]    [Illustration: Fig. 40. Sewing on the Door Flaps.]    First we cut out four lengths of 5 yards and 26 inches each. The strips  were basted together, lapping the edges 1 inch and making a piece 17  feet 2 inches long by 9 feet 9 inches wide. Mother sewed the breadths  together on the machine, using a double seam, as in sail making; that  is, two parallel rows of stitching were sewed in, one along each  overlapping edge, as shown in Fig. 38. A 1-inch hem was then turned and  sewed at the ends of the goods, so that the piece measured exactly 17  feet long. It served for the roof and side walls of the tent. Our next  operation was to cut three strips 11 feet long, and sew them together  with a double seam as before. This piece was now slit along the center  line _m_, Fig. 39, making two lengths 3 feet 8 inches wide. The  strips were then cut along the diagonal lines _a a_, forming the  end walls or doors, so to speak, of the tent. In sewing on the door  flaps we started first at the bottom of the side _c_, sewing it to  the side edge of the main piece, as shown in Fig. 40, and running the  seam up for a distance of exactly 3 feet 6 inches. After all the door  strips had been sewed along their _c_ edges the sewing was  continued up the diagonal or _a_ edges. In cutting out the door  pieces we had allowed 1 inch on each side for hems and seams, so that  the door pieces met without lapping at the exact center of the main or  body piece, that is, at the peak of the tent.    [Illustration: The Wall Tent Set Up in the Back Yard.]    [Illustration: Fig. 41. Adjustable Ridge Pole.]    [Illustration: Fig. 42. The Tent Set Up.]    Our next step was to fasten the necessary ropes and loops. Ten 8-foot  lengths of light rope were procured. These were fastened at the top of  the side walls, that is, 3 feet 6 inches from the ends of the main or  body piece, one at each corner and one on each seam. The cloth was  strengthened at these points with patches sewed on the inside. At the  bottom of the side walls we sewed on loops of heavy tape. These were  spaced about 15 inches apart. Along the _b_ edges of the door  pieces tie strings of tape were fastened. A rope 15 feet long was  attached to the peak at the front and at the rear of the tent. The front  and rear posts of the tent were made from scantlings measuring 2 by 4  inches, which were procured from Mr. Schreiner's lumber yard. They were  planed smooth and sawed off to a length of 7 feet 6 inches. A slot was  cut in the end of each stick to a depth of 6 inches and measuring  slightly over an inch in width. For the ridge pole a strip 1 inch thick,  2-1/2 inches wide and 10 feet long was secured. This was fitted into the  slotted ends of these posts, where it was fastened by wooden pegs  slipped into holes drilled through the ends of the posts and the ridge  pole. A number of these peg holes were provided, so that if the canvas  stretched the ridge pole could be raised or lowered to prevent the walls  from dragging on the ground. We set up the tent in our back yard to see  if it was properly constructed. Twelve stakes were required, ten for the  sides and one for the ridge stays at the front and rear. The side stakes  were driven into the ground at a distance of about 8 feet from the  center of the tent. First we tied the guy ropes to the stakes, but later  we found it much easier to secure them with tie blocks.      TIE BLOCKS.      [Illustration: Fig. 43. The Wood Tie Block.]    [Illustration: Fig. 44. The Wire Tie.]    [Illustration: Fig. 45. Bottom of Tent Wall.]    These were made of wood 1/2 inch thick, 1 inch wide and each measured 3  inches long. A hole was drilled into the block at each end and through  these holes the rope was threaded. A knot in the rope then held the end  from slipping out. The loop between the two holes, or the bight, as  sailors would call it, was now slipped over the stake, and the rope  hauled tight by drawing up the tie block, as shown in Fig. 43. A still  later improvement consisted in making ties of stout galvanized iron  wire, bent to the form shown in Fig. 44. The wooden ties were apt to  swell and split open when exposed to the weather, while the wire ties  could always be relied upon.    The walls of the tent were held down along the bottom by railway spikes  hooked through the tent loops and driven into the ground. Wooden pegs  with notches to catch the loops would have served as well, but Dutchy  happened to find a number of the spikes along the track and in his usual  convincing manner argued that they were far better than pegs because  their weight would hold the cloth down even if they were not firmly  embedded in the ground.      THE ANNEX.    We were surprised to find out how small the tent was after it was set  up. We could see at once that when we had put in all the stores and  provisions we would need, there would not be room enough for six boys  and a man to stretch themselves out comfortably in it. Bill had  evidently made a miscalculation, but he suggested that we remedy the  error by building an annex for our kitchen utensils and supplies.    [Illustration: Fig. 46. Cutting out the Annex.]    [Illustration: Fig. 47. The Annex Applied.]    This gave us a two-room tent, which we found to be quite an advantage.  Twelve more yards of drill were bought and cut into two strips, each 17  feet 2 inches long. The breadths were then sewed together, and the ends  turned up and hemmed to make a piece 17 feet long and 4 feet 9 inches  wide. Tape loops were then sewed on as before, and ropes were fastened  on at the top of the side walls, that is, 3 feet 6 inches from the ends  of the strips. We thought it would be better to have a slanting ridge on  the annex, so we cut out a wedge-shaped piece from the center of the two  strips, as shown by dotted lines _B B_ in Fig. 46. This  wedge-shaped piece measured 2 feet at the outer end of the annex, and  tapered down to a point at the inner end. The canvas was then sewed  together along these edges. Tie strings were sewed to the inner edge of  the annex and corresponding ones were attached to the main tent a little  ways back from the edge, so that the two could be tied together, with  the annex lapping well over on the roof and side walls. A notch was cut  out of the peak of the annex, so that it could be tied around the rear  post of the tent, and notches were cut at the top of the side walls to  permit passing the cloth around the wall ropes. Instead of supporting  the ridge of the annex on a ridge pole, we used the rear guy line of the  tent, propping it up with a scantling about 5-1/2 feet long.          CHAPTER V.    PREPARING FOR THE EXPEDITION.      School closed on the 21st of June that year, just ten days before the  expected arrival of Uncle Ed. The first thing we did was to set up our  tent in the back yard and camp out so as to become acclimatized. It is  good that we did this, for the very first night a heavy summer shower  came up which nearly drenched us. The water beat right through the thin  canvas roof of our tent. Had we been able to afford the best quality of  canvas duck, such an occurrence would probably have been avoided. But we  solved the difficulty by using a tent fly; that is, a strip of canvas  stretched over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#5)"],[1,"in the class burst out laughing. She was silent.    \"Speak, dear,\" said Miss Dove in a persuasive tone.    \"Yes, darling, I'm trying to.\"    \"You mustn't use affectionate words in school.\"    \"Oh, my heart! How am I to bear it?\" said Kathleen, and she clasped a  white hand over that organ.    Miss Dove paused for a moment, and then decided that she would let the  question in dispute go by for the present. She began to question  Kathleen as to her acquirements, and found that she must leave her with  the younger children for the time being. She then went on to attend to  other duties.    Kathleen sat bolt-upright in the centre of the class. It seemed absurd  to see this tall, well-grown girl surrounded by tiny tots. One of the  tiny tots looked towards her. Presently she thrust out a moist little  hand, and out of the moisture produced a half-melted peppermint drop.  Just for a second Kathleen's bright eyes fell upon the sweetmeat with  disgust; then she took it up gingerly and popped it into her mouth.    \"It's golloptious,\" she said, turning to the child, and then she drummed  her fingers once more on the edge of the desk. Presently she stooped  down and whispered to this small girl:    \"I hate school; don't you?\"    \"Y--es,\" was the timid reply.    \"Let's go out.\"    \"But I--I can't.\"    \"I must, then. I have nothing to do; the lessons are deadly stupid.  Forgive me, girls; you are all blameless;\" and the next moment she had  left the room.    Half a moment later she was in the fresh air outside. Her cheeks were  hot, her hair in disorder, and her hand, where she had touched the  peppermint, was sticky.\"    \"What would father say if he could see me now?\" she thought. \"If Aunty  O'Flynn was to look at her Kathleen! Oh, why did they send me across the  cold sea to a place of this sort--a detestable place? Oh, the fresh air  is reviving. I was born free, and Britons never, never will be slaves. I  can't stay in that horrid room. Oh, how long the morning is!\"    Just then a teacher came out and beckoned to Kathleen.    \"What are you doing outside, Miss O'Hara? Come in immediately and return  to your class.\"    \"I can't dear,\" replied Kathleen in a gentle tone. \"You are young,  aren't you? You don't look more than twenty. Do you ever feel your heart  beat wild, dear, and your spirits all in a sort of throb? And did you,  when you were like that, submit to being tied up in steel chains all  round every bit of you? Answer me: did you?\"    \"I can't answer you, Miss O'Hara. You are a very naughty, rebellious  girl. You have come to school to be disciplined. Go back immediately.\"    For a minute Kathleen thought of rebelling, but then she said to  herself, \"It isn't worth the fuss,\" and returned to her place once again  in the centre of the class.    \"I have been called back,\" she said in a whisper to her little  peppermint companion. \"I was naughty to go out, and I am called back. I  am in disgrace. Isn't it a lark?\"    The little girl felt quite excited. Never was there such and big and  fascinating inmate of the lower fifth before. It was worth coming to  school now to be in the vicinity of one so handsome and so gay.    The weary morning came to an end at last. The girls seldom returned for  afternoon school, generally doing their preparations at home. Alice  Tennant, however, sometimes preferred the quiet school to the noisy life  she lived with her brothers at home. She looked now eagerly for  Kathleen, who had shunned her from the instant they had entered the  school; she stood just by the gate waiting for her. Kathleen, on her  part, was looking for Ruth Craven. Ruth had been monopolised by  Cassandra Weldon.    \"You must come home with me,\" she said.    \"But my grandparents will be expecting me,\" said Ruth.    \"Never mind; we will go round by your cottage and ask them. I know all  about you, and I want to know you better. You will, won't you?\"    \"Thank you very much,\" said Ruth.    \"We will go on at once without waiting for the others,\" said Cassandra,  and they walked on quickly, while Kathleen searched in vain for her  chosen friend.    \"Come, Kathleen; I am waiting,\" said Alice in a slightly cross voice.  \"Mother said we were to be home early to-day.\"    \"All right,\" said Kathleen; \"but I can't find Miss Craven anywhere.    \"You can't wait for her now. Indeed, she has gone. I saw her walking  down the road with Cassandra Weldon.\"    \"And who is she?\"    \"The head girl of the school; and such a splendid creature! I am glad  she is taking up Ruth. It isn't possible for every one to notice her;  although, for my part, I have no patience with that sort of false pride.  Of course, a lot of the foundation girls are very common; but when one  sees a perfect lady like Ruth one ought to recognize her.\"    \"Of course,\" said Kathleen, fidgeting a little as she walked.    \"And how did you get on?\" asked Alice, noticing the dejected tone of  her voice.    \"I got on abominably,\" said Kathleen.    \"What class are you in?\"    \"I don't know. I am with a lot of babies; I suppose I am to be a sort of  caretaker to them. There wasn't anything to learn. I am going to write  to father. I can't stay in that horrid school.\"    \"Oh, yes, you can. You will get to like it very much after a time. You  have never been at school before, and of course you find it irksome.\"    \"Is it irksome?\" cried Kathleen. \"Is it that she calls it? Oh, glory!  It's purgatory, my dear, that's what it is--purgatory--and I haven't  done anything to deserve it.\"    \"But you want to learn; you don't want to be always ignorant.\"    \"Bedad, then, darling, I don't want to learn at all. What do I want to  know your sort of things for? I could beat you, every one of you, and  the teachers, too, in some accomplishments. Put me on a horse, darling,  and see what I can do; and put me in a boat, pet, and find out where I  can take you. And set me swimming in the cold sea; I can turn  somersaults and dive and dance on the waves, and do every mortal thing  as though I were a fish, not a girl. And give me a gun and see me bring  down a bird on the wing. Ah! those things ought to be counted in the  education of a woman. I can do all those things, and I can mix whisky  punch, and I can sing songs to the dear old dad, and I can comfort my  mother when her rheumatics are bad. And I can love, love, love! Oh, no,  Alice, I am not ignorant in the true sense; but I hate French, and I  hate arithmetic, and I hate all your horrid school work. And I never  could spell properly; and what does it matter?\"    \"Everything,\" replied Alice. \"You can't go about the world if you are  stupid and ignorant.\"    \"Can't I?\" exclaimed Kathleen, and she flashed her eyes at Alice and  made her feel, as she said afterwards, quite uncanny.    The Tennants were, after all, not a large family. They consisted of Mrs.  Tennant, Alice, and two young brothers. These brothers were schoolboys  of the unruly type. Alice considered them very badly trained. Kathleen,  however, was much taken by their schoolboyish ways.    As the two girls now entered the house they heard a whistle proceeding  from the attic; a cat-call at the same time came from the basement.    \"Oh, dear!\" cried Alice, \"there are those dreadful boys again. Whatever  you do, Kathleen, you must not encourage them in their larks.\"    \"But why shouldn't I? I like them both. I call David a broth of a boy. I  am glad you have got brothers, Alice. I haven't any; but then I have  lots of boy cousins, which comes to much the same thing.\"    The girls by this time had reached the large bedroom which they shared  on the first floor.    \"You are welcome to my brothers if you don't toss all your things about  in my room,\" cried Alice. \"If we are to sleep together we must be  orderly.\"    \"Orderly, is it?\" cried Kathleen. \"I don't know the meaning of the word.  Well, all right, I'm ready.\"    She pushed her fingers through her tangled golden hair, and, without  glancing at herself in the glass, marched out of the room.    \"I wish mother hadn't asked her to come,\" said Alice to herself. \"The  house was bad enough before, but now she will make things past bearing.\"    Alice went downstairs to the sound of a cracked gong. The Tennants had  their meals in a sitting-room on the second floor. It was barely  furnished, and had kamptulicon instead of a carpet on the floor. Mrs.  Tennant, looking careworn and anxious, was seated at the head of the  table; her dress was somewhat faded. Alice entered and took her seat at  the foot. Kathleen was nowhere to be seen.    \"I have only soup and fish for dinner to-day,\" said Mrs. Tennant. \"I do  trust Kathleen will be satisfied.\"    Alice frowned at her mother in some displeasure.    \"We ought to have meat--\" she was beginning, when there came a bang and  a scuffle, a girlish laugh, and Kathleen, leaning fondly on both the  boys, appeared. Mrs. Tennant pointed to a seat, and she sat down. The  Irish girl had a healthy appetite, and was indifferent to what she ate.  She demanded two plates of soup, and when she had finished the second  she looked at Mrs. Tennant and said emphatically:    \"I have fallen in love.\"    \"My dear Kathleen!\"    \"I have--with a girl, so it doesn't matter. She's the prettiest,  sweetest, bonniest thing I ever saw in my life. I am going to hunt round  for her immediately after dinner. I thought I'd say so, for I mean to do  it.\"    \"Oh, Kathleen!\" said Alice in a distressed voice, \"you really mustn't.  You must come back to the school with me. I promised Miss Dove that I'd  see you through your tasks.--You know, mother,\" continued Alice,  \"Kathleen is not very advanced for her age, and Miss Dove wants to get  her into a proper class as quickly as possible; therefore she is to be  coached a little, and I have undertaken to do it.--You will come with  me, Kathleen? I must get back to the school again by half-past two. You  will be sure to come, dear?\"    \"I think not, dear,\" replied Kathleen"]]]
