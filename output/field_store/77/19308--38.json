Cycles of civilisations, all essentially  similar, have been evolved, one after another, to endure for a while and  then to fade away, leaving the raw material of human kind as it was from  the beginning. There is no evidence of any advancement in physique,  intellect or moral character. The leaders of mankind were the  law-givers, whether they were witch doctors, priests, chiefs, prophets  or kings, and they all sought to establish their laws by claiming  supernatural delegation and authority. With writing came the codes, and  when we compare the statutes of Hammurabi, who flourished about 2,200  years B.C., with those compiled by his successors, Moses, Solon,  Justinian and Napoleon, we find in them all evidence of the same mental  appreciation and capacity in dealing with the social conditions and  problems of their respective periods. The greatest products of art are  still met with in the sculptured forms of ancient Greece, those images  of serene beauty which may be imitated but not excelled. The reasoning  powers of the ancient philosophers who, long before Christ was born,  debated the still unanswered riddles of existence, when we compare the  paucity of data on which they had to work with the wealth of knowledge  now available, must be ranked as high as the intellectual ability of our  foremost thinkers of to-day. In mechanical proficiency the world has  indeed advanced to an astonishing extent, but the perfection of our  modern machinery means only a gradual and very recent advance upon  earlier methods and does not denote a corresponding development in the  mind itself. The Greeks had no machinery to speak of, neither had the  English in the days of Shakespeare and Newton, but who can doubt that  the engineers of those times would have been equal to the task of  understanding and applying the principles of modern mechanics had the  necessary books been available to them? We do not assume that because  the modern Germans excel as chemists they are therefore blessed with  higher reasoning ability than were the contemporaries of Socrates and  Plato who had no knowledge of the science of chemistry. The conclusion  forced upon us after a sober and impartial survey of the facts of  history is that, although the intellectual output of the world is always  increasing, the intellect itself remains unaltered. Knowledge, we see,  is after all, only descriptive, never fundamental. We can describe the  appearance and condition of a process, but not the way of it, and though  knowledge has come in rich abundance, wisdom still lingers.    The foregoing argument shows that the alleged mental superiority of the  European cannot be due to constant use or education, so that it now  becomes necessary for those who maintain that it nevertheless exists to  prove, not only that the white man's intellectual capacity is now  superior but to prove also that from the beginning it has always been  stronger and better than that of the African Native, or, in other words,  those who believe that the white race has inherent mental superiority  must prove innate inferiority in the mental make-up of the Native.    There is a more or less indefinite notion abroad that the Bantu  languages, as compared with those of Europe, are but poor and  ineffective vehicles for the conveyance of abstract ideas, wherefore the  capacity to form and entertain such ideas may be taken to be innately  inferior in the Native brain. That the language of a people embodies, so  to speak, in objective form the intellectual progress made by it is  certainly true, and it will be well, therefore, to state briefly the  actual and potential value of the Native speech as compared with that of  the whites.    The living and the dead languages of the world have been classified by  philologists into three main types of linguistic morphology; the  isolating, like Chinese; the agglutinative, like Turkish and Bantu, and  the inflective, like Latin. It was customary not long ago to look upon  these three types as steps in a process of historical development, the  isolating representing the most primitive form of speech at which it was  possible to arrive, the agglutinative coming next in order as a type  evolved from the isolating, and the inflective as the latest and  so-called highest type of all. But since the matter has been carefully  studied it has been admitted that there is no satisfactory evidence for  believing in any evolution of linguistic types. English is now  considered to be an isolating language in the making while Chinese is  cited by authoritative European scholars as being a language which with  the simplest possible means at its disposal can express the most  technical or philosophical ideas with absolute freedom from ambiguity  and with admirable conciseness and direction.[16]    While I do not pretend to philological authority I do claim the ability  to make a sound comparison between the main Bantu languages which I know  and those European languages with which I happen to be familiar, and I  have no hesitation in saying that though the Bantu types are not at  present as fully developed in point of simplicity and preciseness as are  the main languages of Europe they are, nevertheless, by reason of their  peculiar genius, capable of being rapidly developed into as perfect a  means for the expression of human thought as any of the European types  of speech; they are astonishingly rich in verbs which make it easy to  express motion and action clearly and vividly; the impersonal, or  abstract article \"it\" is used exactly as in European languages, and the  particular prefix provided in some of the Bantu types for the class of  nouns which represent abstract conceptions makes it possible to increase  the vocabularies in that direction _ad infinitum_. The Bantu types are  not so-called holophrastic forms of primitive speech in which the  compounding of expressions is said to take the place of the conveyance  of ideas, nor are they made up of onomatopoetic, or interjectional  expressions, if indeed such languages exist anywhere outside the heads  of the half-informed. They are languages equal in potential capacity to  any included in the main Indo-European group. Even now in their  comparatively undeveloped state these languages are capable of  expressing the subtleties of early philosophical speculation. I would  not, for instance, feel daunted if I were set the task of translating  into any of these main types, say, the dialectics of Socrates. To do  this I would first reduce the more complex terms to such simple and  common Anglo-Saxon words as when built together would give the same  meaning, and then translate these into their Bantu equivalents. The  substitution of Anglo-Saxon words for those of modern English would, no  doubt, involve a good deal of repetition but the sense would be  adequately rendered. I would proceed in the same way as the early  teachers and writers who had to build up the language they used as they  went along. The English indeed, have not built up their world-wide  speech with their own materials but have, with characteristic  acquisitiveness taken the combinations they wanted, ready made, mainly  from Greek, Latin and French. How far and how well a Native would  understand my presentation of metaphysical speculation would depend upon  the degree of familiarity he might have acquired, through Missionary  teaching or otherwise, with abstract notions in general. In my opinion  the average \"raw\" Native would understand as well and as much as the  average uneducated European peasant. Both would probably find my  disquisition \"sad stuff\"; both would require time for that repetition of  the words which is necessary to familiarise the mind with the  unaccustomed ideas they represent; in both cases one would have to \"give  them the words that the ideas may come.\" A single illustration will show  my meaning. When the first Missionaries rendered the word \"soul\" into  Zulu by the word signifying \"breath\" in that language they simply  followed the example of their predecessors of antiquity who employed the  Latin _spiritus_, which also means \"breath,\" for the same purpose,  namely, to convey to their hearers the idea of a breath-like or  ethereal something housed in, but separable from, the human body.    \"The essence of language,\" said Aristotle, \"is that it should be clear  and not mean.\" The raw Bantu material is ample for compliance with this  demand, and the process of development will not be as protracted as in  early Europe for it may be accomplished here, largely, by the simple  means of translating the words already thought out and provided in the  white man's language. In so far, then, as we attempt to measure the  mentality of the Natives by their language we find that they cannot be  relegated to a lower plane than that occupied by the uneducated  peasantry of Europe of a few decades ago.    Most people are prepared to believe that the primary psychical processes  are identical in all races, but many still profess to see a difference  in favour of the white man in what they call the higher faculties of the  mind. But the much-abused word \"faculty\" no longer bears the meaning  given to it by Locke and his followers who propounded a limitless brood  or set of faculties to correspond with every process discoverable by  introspection as taking place in the mind. In modern psychology the  word means simply a capacity for an ultimate, irreducible, or  unanalysable mode of thinking of, or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14909"],[0,"Elsie's New Relations (#5)"],[1,"ladies;  but especially those of this family. He is like his father in that. Zoe  is, I think, a particular favorite with him.\"    Evidently Zoe had overheard the remark, for she turned in their direction  with a bright look and smile; then springing up came quickly toward them,  and taking possession of a low chair near at hand, \"Was it Max you were  talking of, Violet?\" she said. \"Yes, indeed, I am fond of him. I think  he's a splendid boy. But what was wrong with him to-night?\"    \"Nothing, so far as I know,\" said Violet \"Why do you think there was?\"    \"Because he was so unusually quiet; and then his father took him away so  early. Ah, here comes the captain now,\" as the door opened and Captain  Raymond entered; \"so I'll go away and let you have him to yourself.\"    \"You needn't,\" said Violet, but Zoe was already by Edward's side again.    Elsie, too, rose and went to her mother to ask if she were not weary of  holding the babe.    Violet looked up a little anxiously into her husband's face as she made  room for him on the sofa by her side. \"Is anything wrong with the  children, Levis?\" she asked in an undertone.    \"No, love,\" he said; \"I took them away early that I might have a little  serious talk with the older two. You know I shall not long be afforded the  opportunity.\"    \"But you look troubled,\" she said, in tenderly sympathizing accents. \"May  I not share your care or sorrow, whatever it is?\"    \"I would rather share only joys and blessings with you, dearest, and keep  the cares and burdens to myself,\" he answered, smiling lovingly upon her,  and pressing with affectionate warmth the little hand she had placed in  his.    \"No, I can't consent to that,\" she said. \"I consider it one of my precious  privileges to be allowed to share your burdens and anxieties. Won't you  tell me what troubles you?\"    \"It is nothing new, little wife,\" he answered cheerfully; \"but I am  doubting whether I do right to give your mother and grandfather so  troublesome a charge as Lulu. She is almost certain to be wilful and  rebellious occasionally, if not oftener.\"    Mrs. Travilla had resigned the babe to its mother, and was now standing  near the sofa where the captain and Violet sat.    \"Mamma,\" said the latter, turning to her, \"my husband is making himself  miserable with the fear that Lulu will prove too troublesome to you and  grandpa.\"    \"Please do not, captain,\" Elsie said brightly, accepting the easy-chair he  hastened to bring forward for her. \"Why should I not have a little trouble  as well as other people? Lulu is an attractive child to me, very bright  and original, a little headstrong, perhaps, but I shall lay siege to her  heart and try to rule her through her affections.\"    \"I think that will be the better plan,\" he said, the look of care lifting  from his brow; \"she is a warm-hearted child, and more easily led than  driven. But she is sometimes very impertinent, and I would by no means  have her indulged in that. I wish you would promise me never to let it  pass without punishment. She must be taught respect for authority and for  her superiors.\"    Elsie's face had grown very grave while he was speaking. \"What punishment  do you prescribe?\" she asked. \"The child is yours.\"    \"That should depend upon the heinousness of the offence,\" he replied. \"I  can only say, please treat her exactly as if she were your own.\"    Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore now joined them, and the question what studies the  children should pursue during the coming winter was discussed and settled.  Then the captain spoke of reading matter, asked advice in regard to  suitable books and periodicals, and begged his friends to have a careful  oversight of all the mental food of his children.    \"You could not intrust that matter to a more wise and capable person than  papa,\" Elsie said, with an affectionate, smiling look at her father. \"I  well remember how strict he was with me in my childhood; novels were  coveted but forbidden sweets.\"    \"You must have been glad when you were old enough to read them, mamma,\"  remarked Zoe, joining the circle.    \"You read far too many, my little woman,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, pinching her  rosy cheek. \"If I were Edward, I should curtail the supply, and try to  cultivate a taste for something better.\"    \"But I'm a married woman and sha'n't submit to being treated like a child,  grandpa,\" she said, with a little pout and a toss of her pretty head.    \"Not even by me?\" asked Edward, leaning down over her as he stood behind  her chair.    \"No, not even by you,\" she returned saucily, looking up into his face with  laughing eyes. \"I'm your wife, sir, not your child.\"    \"Both, I should say,\" laughed Edward. \"I remember that I was considered a  mere child at your age. And whatever you are you belong to me, don't you?\"    \"Yes; and you to me just as much,\" she retorted, and at that there was a  general laugh.    The captain had said nothing of the objectionable reading matter found in  his children's hands that day, but when alone with Violet in their own  room, he told her all about it, blaming himself severely for not having  been so watchful over them as he ought, and expressing his distress over  the discovery that Max had sometimes been guilty of profanity.    \"I do not know whether it has become a habit with him,\" he said, \"but, my  dear, I beg of you to watch him closely when I am away, and if he is ever  known to offend in that way, see that he is properly punished.\"    \"But how, Levis?\" she asked, with a troubled look. \"I don't know what I  can do but talk seriously to him about the wickedness of it.\"    \"I hope you will do that, my dear. I have no doubt it would have an  excellent effect, for he loves and admires you greatly. But let him be  punished by being separated, for at least a week, from the rest of the  family, as unworthy to associate with them.\"    \"Oh, that would be very hard, very humiliating for a proud, sensitive,  affectionate boy like Max!\" she exclaimed. \"May we not be a little more  lenient toward him?\" and she looked up pleadingly into her husband's face.    \"No,\" he said with decision; \"but I strongly hope there will be no  occasion for such punishment, as he seems sincerely penitent and quite  determined not to offend in that way again. I really think my boy wants to  do right, but he is a heedless, thoughtless fellow, often going wrong from  mere carelessness and forgetfulness. But he must be taught to think and to  remember.\"    \"I wish he could have his father's constant care and control,\" sighed  Violet.    \"I wish he could indeed!\" responded the captain; \"but principally because  I fear he will prove a care and trouble to your grandfather and mother,  who, I am inclined to think, are more capable than I of giving him proper  training. I shall go away feeling easier in regard to my children's  welfare than I ever have before since they lost their mother.\"    \"I am very glad of that, Levis,\" Violet said, her eyes shining with  pleasure, \"and I do believe they will have a happy life at Ion.\"    \"It will certainly be their own fault if they do not,\" he replied.           *       *       *       *       *    Rose Travilla was somewhat less amiable in disposition than her mother and  older sisters, and had been much disgusted with Lulu's exhibition of  temper that evening.    Talking with her mother afterward in her dressing-room, \"Mamma,\" she said,  \"I wish you hadn't offered to let Lulu Raymond live with us at Ion. I  don't at all like the way she behaves, and I wish you and grandpa would  tell her father to send her off to boarding-school.\"    \"That is an unkind wish, Rose,\" said her mother. \"Perhaps if you had had  the same treatment Lulu has been subjected to since her mother's death,  you might have shown as bad a temper as hers. Haven't you some pity for  the little girl, when you reflect that she is motherless?\"    \"I don't think she could have a sweeter mother than our Vi,\" was the  unexpected rejoinder. \"But she doesn't appreciate her in the least,\" Rose  went on, \"but seems always on the watch against any effort on Vi's part to  control her.\"    \"She seems to be naturally impatient of control by whomsoever exerted,\"  Mrs. Travilla said, \"but we will hope to see her improve in that respect,  and you must set her a good example, Rose.    \"And I want you to think how sad it would be for her to be parted from the  brother and sister she loves so dearly and sent away alone to  boarding-school. I shall never forget how alarmed and distressed I was  when your grandpa threatened me with one.\"    \"Did he, mamma?\" asked Rosie, opening her eyes very wide with surprise.    \"Yes, he was very much displeased with me at the time,\" her mother said  with a sigh. \"But we will not talk about it; the recollection is very  painful to me.\"    \"No, mamma; but I cannot get over my astonishment, for I thought you were  never naughty, even when you were a little child.\"    \"Quite a mistake, Rosie; I had my naughty times as well as other  children,\" Mrs. Travilla said, smiling at Rosie's bewildered look. \"But  now I want you to promise me, my child, that you will be kind and  forbearing toward poor little motherless Lulu.\"    \"Well, mamma, to please you I will; but I hope she won't try me too much  by impertinence to you or Violet. I don't think I can stand it if she  does.    \"Try to win her love, Rosie, and then you may be able to influence her  strongly for good.\"    \"I don't know how to begin, mamma.\"    \"Force your thoughts to dwell on the good points in her character, and  think compassionately of the respects in which she is less fortunate than  yourself, and you will soon find a feeling of love toward her springing up  in your heart; and love begets love. Do her some kindness, daughter, and  that will help you to love her and to gain her love.\"    \"Well, mamma, I shall try if only to please you. But do tell me, did  grandpa punish you very severely when you were naughty?\"    \"His"]]]
