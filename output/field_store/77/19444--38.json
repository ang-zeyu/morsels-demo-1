The name Saoshyant signifies _the useful       one, the saviour_; Ukshyate-reta, _he who malces the good       increase_; Ukshyatnemo, _he who makes prayer increase_.    Saoshyant, assisted by fifteen men and fifteen pure women, who have  already lived on earth, and are awaiting their final destiny in a magic  slumber, shall offer the final sacrifice, the virtue of which shall  bring about the resurrection of the dead. \"The sovereign light shall  accompany him and his friends, when he shall revivify the world and  ransom it from old age and death, from corruption and decay, and shall  render it eternally living, eternally growing, and master of itself.\"  The fatal conflict shall be protracted, but the champions of Saoshyant  shall at length obtain the victory. \"Before them shall bow Aeshma of the  blood-stained lance and of ominous renown, and Saoshyant shall strike  down the she-demon of the unholy light, the daughter of darkness.  Akem-mano strikes, but Vohu-mano shall strike him in his turn; the lying  word shall strike, but the word of truth shall strike him in his turn;  Haurvatat and Ameretafc shall strike down hunger and thirst; Haurvatat  and Ameretat shall strike down terrible hunger and terrible thirst.\"  Angro-mainyus himself shall be paralysed with terror, and shall be  forced to confess the supremacy of good: he shall withdraw into the  depths of hell, whence he shall never again issue forth, and all the  reanimated beings devoted to the Mazdean law shall live an eternity of  peace and contentment.    Man, therefore, incessantly distracted between the two principles, laid  wait for by the Baevas, defended by the Yazatas, must endeavour to act  according to law and justice in the condition in which fate has placed  him. He has been raised up here on earth to contribute as far as in him  lies to the increase of life and of good, and in proportion as he works  for this end or against it, is he the _ashavan_, the pure, the faithful  one on earth and the blessed one in heaven, or the _anashavan_, the  lawless miscreant who counteracts purity. The highest grade in the  hierarchy of men belongs of right to the Mage or the _athravan_, to the  priest whose voice inspires the demons with fear, or the soldier whose  club despatches the impious, but a place of honour at their side is  assigned to the peasant, who reclaims from the power of Angro-mainyus the  dry and sterile fields. Among the places where the earth thrives most  joyously is reckoned that \"where a worshipper of Ahura-mazda builds a  house, with a chaplain, with cattle, with a wife, with sons, with a fair  flock; where man grows the most corn, herbage, and fruit trees; where he  spreads water on a soil without water, and drains off water where  there is too much of it.\" He who sows corn, sows good, and promotes the  Mazdean faith; \"he nourishes the Mazdean religion as fifty men would do  rocking a child in the cradle, five hundred women giving it suck from  their breasts.* When the corn was created the Daevas leaped, when it  sprouted the Daevas lost courage, when the stem set the Daevas wept,  when the ear swelled the Daevas fled. In the house where corn is  mouldering the Daevas lodge, but when the corn sprouts, one might say  that a hot iron is being turned round in their mouths.\" And the reason  of their horror is easily divined: \"Whoso eats not, has no power either  to accomplish a valiant work of religion, or to labour with valour,  or yet to beget children valiantly; it is by eating that the universe  lives, and it dies from not eating.\" The faithful follower of Zoroaster  owes no obligation towards the impious man or towards a stranger,** but  is ever bound to render help to his coreligionist.         * The original text says in a more enigmatical fashion, \"he       nourishes the religion of Mazda as a hundred feet of men and       a thousand breasts of women might do.\"         ** Charity is called in Parsee language, _asho-dad_ the       _gift to a pious man_, or the _gift of piety_, and the pious       man, the _ashavan_, is by definition the worshipper of       Ahura-mazda alone.    He will give a garment to the naked, and by so doing will wound Zemaka,  the demon of winter. He will never refuse food to the hungry labourer,  under pain of eternal torments, and his charity will extend even to  the brute beasts, provided that they belong to the species created by  Ahura-mazda: he has duties towards them, and their complaints, heard  in heaven, shall be fatal to him later on if he has provoked them.  Asha-vahista will condemn to hell the cruel man who has ill-treated the  ox, or allowed his flocks to suffer; and the killing of a hedgehog is  no less severely punished--for does not a hedgehog devour the ants  who steal the grain? The dog is in every case an especially sacred  animal--the shepherd's dog, the watchdog, the hunting-dog, even the  prowling dog. It is not lawful to give any dog a blow which renders him  impotent, or to slit his ears, or to cut his foot, without incurring  grave responsibilities in this world and in the next; it is necessary to  feed the dog well, and not to throw bones to him which are too hard, nor  have his food served hot enough to burn his tongue or his throat. For  the rest, the faithful Zoroastrian was bound to believe in his god, to  offer to him the orthodox prayers and sacrifices, to be simple in heart,  truthful, the slave of his pledged word, loyal in his very smallest  acts. If he had once departed from the right way, he could only return  to it by repentance and by purification, accompanied by pious deeds:  to exterminate noxious animals, the creatures of Angro-mainyus and the  abode of his demons, such as the frog, the scorpion, the serpent or  the ant, to clear the sterile tracts, to restore impoverished land,  to construct bridges over running water, to distribute implements of  husbandry to pions men, or to build them a house, to give a pure and  healthy maiden in marriage to a just man,--these were so many means of  expiation appointed by the prophet.* Marriage was strictly obligatory,**  and seemed more praiseworthy in proportion as the kinship existing  between the married pair was the closer: not only was the sister united  in marriage to her brother, as in Egypt, but the father to his daughter,  and the mother to her son, at least among the Magi.         * A passage in the _Vendidad_ even enumerates how many       noisome beasts must be slain to accomplish one full work of       expiation--\"to kill 1000 serpents of those who drag       themselves upon the belly, and 2000 of the other species,       1000 land frogs or 2000 water frogs, 1000 ants who steal the       grain,\" and so on.         ** The _Vendidad_ says, \"And I tell thee, O Spitama       Zarathustra, the man who has a wife is above him who lives       in continency;\" and, as we have seen in the text, one of       these forms of expiation consisted in \"marrying to a worthy       man a young girl who has never known a man\" (_Vendidad_, 14,       Sec. 15). Herodotus of old remarked that one of the chief       merits in an Iranian was to have many children: the King of       Persia encouraged fecundity in his realm, and awarded a       prize each year to that one of his subjects who could boast       the most numerous progeny.    Polygamy was also encouraged and widely practised: the code imposed no  limit on the number of wives and concubines, and custom was in favour of  a man's having as many wives as his fortune permitted him to maintain.  On the occasion of a death, it was forbidden to burn the corpse, to bury  it, or to cast it into a river, as it would have polluted the fire,  the earth, or the water--an unpardonable offence. The corpse could be  disposed of in different ways. The Persians were accustomed to cover it  with a thick layer of wax, and then to bury it in the ground: the wax  coating obviated the pollution which direct contact would have brought  upon the soil. The Magi, and probably also strict devotees, following  their example, exposed the corpse in the open air, abandoning it to the  birds or beasts of prey. It was considered a great misfortune if these  respected the body, for it was an almost certain indication of the wrath  of Ahura-mazda, and it was thought that the defunct had led an evil  life. When the bones had been sufficiently stripped of flesh, they were  collected together, and deposited either in an earthenware urn or in a  stone ossuary with a cover, or in a monumental tomb either hollowed out  in the heart of the mountain or in the living rock, or raised up  above the level of the ground. Meanwhile the soul remained in the  neighbourhood for three days, hovering near the head of the corpse, and  by the recitation of prayers it experienced, according to its condition  of purity or impurity, as much of joy or sadness as the whole world  experiences. When the third night was past, the just soul set forth  across luminous plains, refreshed by a perfumed breeze, and its good  thoughts and words and deeds took shape before it \"under the guise of a  young maiden, radiant and strong, with well-developed bust, noble mien,  and glorious face, about fifteen years of age, and as beautiful as the  most beautiful;\" the unrighteous soul, on the contrary, directed its  course towards the north, through a tainted land, amid the squalls of a  pestilential hurricane, and there encountered its past ill deeds, under  the form of an ugly and wicked young woman, the ugliest and most wicked  it had ever seen. The genius Rashnu Razishta, the essentially truthful,  weighed its virtues or vices in an unerring balance, and acquitted or  Condemned it on the impartial testimony of its past life. On issuing  from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17330"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#5)"],[1,"sent from  Alexander on the Indus, and he seems to have forgotten the mild feelings  which guided his master; yet, upon the whole, after the galling yoke of  the Persians, the Egyptians must have felt grateful for the blessings of  justice and good government.    At one time, when passing through the Thebaid in his barge on the Nile,  Cleomenes was wrecked, and one of his children bitten by a crocodile. On  this plea, he called together the priests, probably of Crocodilopolis,  where this animal was held sacred, and told them that he intended  to revenge himself upon the crocodiles by having them all caught  and killed; and he was only bought off from carrying his threat into  execution by the priests giving him all the treasure that they could  get together. Alexander had left orders that the great market should be  moved from Canopus to his new city of Alexandria, as soon as it should  be ready to receive it. As the building went forward, the priests and  rich traders of Canopus, in alarm at losing the advantages of their  port, gave Cleomenes a large sum of money for leave to keep their  market open. This sum he took, and, when the building at Alexandria was  finished, he again came to Canopus, and because the traders would not or  could not raise a second and larger sum, he carried Alexander's orders  into execution, and closed the market of their city.    But instances such as these, of a public officer making use of dishonest  means to increase the amount of the revenue which it was his duty to  collect, might unfortunately be found even in countries which were for  the most part enjoying the blessings of wise laws and good government;  and it is not probable that, while Alexander was with the army in  Persia, the acts of fraud and wrong should have been fewer in his own  kingdom of Macedonia. The dishonesty of Cleomenes was indeed equally  shown toward the Macedonians, by his wish to cheat the troops out of  part of their pay. The pay of the soldiers was due on the first day of  each month, but on that day he took care to be out of the way, and  the soldiers were paid a few days later; and by doing the same on each  following month, he at length changed the pay-day to the last day of the  month, and cheated the army out of a whole month's pay.    Another act for which Cleomenes was blamed was not so certainly wrong.  One summer, when the harvest had been less plentiful than usual, he  forbade the export of grain, which was a large part of the trade of  Egypt, thereby lowering the price to the poor so far as they could  afford to purchase such costly food, but injuring the landowners. On  this, the heads of the provinces sent to him in alarm, to say that they  should not be able to get in the usual amount of tribute; he therefore  allowed the export as usual, but raised the duty; and he was reproached  for receiving a larger revenue while the landowners were suffering from  a smaller crop.    [Illustration: 027.jpg LIGHTHOUSE AT ALEXANDRIA]    At Ecbatana, the capital of Media, Alexander lost his friend Hephaestion,  and in grief for his death he sent to Egypt to enquire of the oracle at  the temple of Kneph in the oasis of Ammon, what honours he might pay  to the deceased. The messengers brought him an answer, that he might  declare Hephaestion a demigod, and order that he should be worshipped.  Accordingly, Alexander then sent an express command to Cleomenes that  he should build a temple to his lost favourite in his new city of  Alexandria, and that the lighthouse which was to be built on the island  of Pharos should be named after him; and as modern insurances against  risks by sea usually begin with the words \"In the name of God; Amen;\"  so all contracts between merchants in the port of Alexandria were to  be written solemnly \"In the name of Hephaestion.\" Feeling diffident  of enforcing obedience at the mouth of the Nile, while he was himself  writing from the sources of the Indus, he added that if, when he came to  Egypt he found his wish carried into effect, he would pardon Cleomenes  for those acts of misgovernment of which he had been accused, and for  any others which might then come to his ears.    A somatophylax in the Macedonian army was no doubt at first, as the  word means, one of the officers who had to answer for the king's safety;  perhaps in modern language a colonel in the body-guards or household  troops; but as, in unmixed monarchies, the faithful officer who was  nearest the king's person, to whose watchfulness he trusted in the hour  of danger, often found himself the adviser in matters of state, so,  in the time of Alexander, the title of somatophylax was given to those  generals on whose wisdom the king chiefly leaned, and by whose advice  he was usually guided. Among these, and foremost in Alexander's love and  esteem, was Ptolemy, the son of Lagus. Philip, the father of Alexander,  had given Arsinoe, one of his relations, in marriage to Lagus; and her  eldest son Ptolemy, born soon after the marriage, was always thought to  be the king's son, though never so acknowledged. As he grew up, he was  put into the highest offices by Philip, without raising in the young  Alexander's mind the distrust which might have been felt if Ptolemy  could have boasted that he was the elder brother. He earned the good  opinion of Alexander by his military successes in Asia, and gained his  gratitude by saving his life when he was in danger among the Oxydracae,  near the river Indus; and moreover, Alexander looked up to him as the  historian whose literary powers and knowledge of military tactics were  to hand down to the wonder of future ages those conquests which he  witnessed.    Alexander's victories over Darius, and march to the river Indus, are no  part of this history: it is enough to say that he died at Babylon eight  years after he had entered Egypt; and his half-brother Philip Arridaeus,  a weak-minded, unambitious young man, was declared by the generals  assembled at Babylon to be his successor. His royal blood united more  voices in the army in his favour than the warlike and statesmanlike  character of any one of the rival generals. They were forced to be  content with sharing the provinces between them as his lieutenants;  some hoping to govern by their power over the weak mind of Arridaeus, and  others secretly meaning to make themselves independent.    In this weighty matter, Ptolemy showed the wisdom and judgment which  had already gained him his high character. Though his military rank and  skill were equal to those of any one of Alexander's generals, and his  claim by birth perhaps equal to that of Arridaeous, he was not one of  those who aimed at the throne; nor did he even aim at the second place,  but left to Perdiccas the regency, with the care of the king's person,  in whose name that ambitious general vainly hoped to govern the whole of  Alexander's conquests. But Ptolemy, more wisely measuring his strength  with the several tasks, chose the province of Egypt, the province which,  cut off as it was from the rest by sea and desert, was of all others  the easiest to be held as an independent kingdom against the power of  Perdiccas. When Egypt was given to Ptolemy by the council of generals,  Cleomenes was at the same time and by the same power made second in  command, and he governed Egypt for one year before Ptolemy's arrival,  that being in name the first year of the reign of Philip Arridaeus, or,  according to the chronologer's mode of dating, the first year after  Alexander's death.    [Illustration: 031.jpg PAGE IMAGE]          CHAPTER II--EGYPT UNDER PTOLEMY SOTER      _Ptolemy governs Egypt, overcomes Perdiccas, and founds a dynasty_.      Ptolemy Lagus was one of those who, at the death of Alexander, had  raised their voices against giving the whole of the conquered countries  to one king; he wished that they should have been shared equally among  the generals as independent kingdoms. In this he was overruled, and  he accepted his government as the lieutenant of the youthful Philip  Arridaeus, though no doubt with the fixed purpose of making Egypt an  independent kingdom. On reaching Memphis, the seat of his government,  his whole thoughts were turned towards strengthening himself against  Perdiccas, who hoped to be obeyed, in the name of his young and  weak-minded king, by all his fellow generals.    The Greek and foreign mercenaries of which the army of Alexander was  made up, and who were faithful to his memory and to his family, had  little to guide them in the choice of which leader they should follow  to his distant province, beside the thought of where they should be  best treated; and Ptolemy's high character for wisdom, generosity, and  warlike skill had gained many friends for him among the officers; they  saw that the wealth of Egypt would put it in his power to reward those  whose services were valuable to him; and hence crowds flocked to his  standard. On reaching their provinces, the Greek soldiers, whether  Spartans or Athenians, forgetting the glories of Thermopylae and  Marathon, and proud of their wider conquests under the late king, always  called themselves Macedonians. They pleased themselves with the thought  that the whole of the conquered countries were still governed by  the brother of Alexander; and no one of his generals, in his wildest  thoughts of ambition, whether aiming, like Ptolemy, at founding a  kingdom, or, like Perdiccas, at the government of the world, was unwise  enough to throw off the title of lieutenant to Philip Arridaeus, and to  forfeit the love of the Macedonian soldiers and his surest hold on their  loyalty.    The first act of Ptolemy was to put to death Cleomenes, who had been  made sub-governor of Egypt by the same council of generals which  had made Ptolemy governor. This act may have been called for by the  dishonesty and crooked dealing which Cleomenes had been guilty of in  collecting taxes; but, though"]]]
