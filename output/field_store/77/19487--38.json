They did not  represent any new interests, but were merely the individualisation of  certain phases of the old deities, phases which had always been present  and were now at most merely emphasised by being worshipped separately.          THE REORGANISATION OF SERVIUS      Like a lofty peak rising above the mists which cover the tops of the  lower-lying mountains, the figure of Servius Tullius towers above the  semi-legendary Tarquins on either side of him. We feel that we have to  do with a veritable character in history, and we find ourselves  wondering what sort of a man he was personally--a feeling that never  occurs to us with Romulus and the older kings, and comes to us only  faintly with the elder Tarquin, while the younger Tarquin has all the  marks of a wooden man, who was put up only to be thrown down, whose  whole _raison d'etre_ is to explain the transition from the kingdom to  the republic on the theory of a revolution. Eliminate the revolution,  suppose the change to have been a gradual and a constitutional one, and  you may discard the proud Tarquin without losing anything but a  lay-figure with its more or less gaudy trappings of later myths. But it  is not so with Servius; his wall and his constitution are very real and  defy all attempts to turn their maker into a legend. Yet on the other  hand we must be on our guard, for much of the definiteness which seems  to attach to him is rather the definiteness of a certain stage in Rome's  development, a certain well-bounded chronological and sociological  tract. It is dangerous to try to limit too strictly Servius's personal  part in this development; and far safer, though perhaps less  fascinating, to use his name as a general term for the changes which  Rome underwent from the time when foreign influences began to tell upon  her until the beginning of the republic. He forms a convenient title  therefore for certain phases of Rome's growth. And yet even this is not  strictly correct, for Servius stands not so much for the coming into  existence of certain facts, as for the recognition of the existence of  these facts. The facts themselves were of slow growth, covering probably  centuries, but the actions resulting from them, and the outward changes  in society, came thick and fast and may well have taken place, all of  them, within the limits of one man's life. The foundation fact upon  which all these changes were based is the influence of the outside world  on the Roman community. Until this time there had been little to  differentiate Rome from any other of the hill-communities of Italy, of  which there were scores in her immediate neighbourhood; nor was she the  only one to come into contact with the outside world. It was the effect  which that influence had upon her as contrasted with her neighbours  which made the difference. When we ask why this influence affected her  differently we find no satisfactory answer, and are in the presence of a  mystery--the world-old insoluble mystery of the superiority of one tribe  or one individual over others apparently of the same class. Political  history is wont to tell this chapter of Rome's story under the title of  the \"Rise of the Plebeians,\" but the presence of the Plebeians was only  the outward symbol of an inward change. This change was the breaking up  of the monotonous one-class society of the primitive community with its  one--agricultural--interest, and the formation of a variegated  many-class society with manifold interests, such as trade, handicraft,  and politics. It was the awakening of Rome into a world-life out of her  century-long undisturbed bucolic slumber.    There were at this time two peoples in Italy, who by reason of their  older culture were able to be Rome's teachers. One lay to the north of  her, the mysterious Etruscans, whose culture fortunately for Rome had  only a very moderate influence, because the Etruscan culture had already  lost much of its virility, possibly also because it was distinctly felt  to be foreign, and hence could effect no insidious entry, and probably  because Rome was at this time too strong and young and clean to take  anything but the best from Etruria. The other lay to the south, the  Greek colonies of Magna Graecia, separated from Rome for the present by  many miles of forest and by hostile tribes. Around her in Latium were  her own next of kin, the Latins, becoming rapidly inferior to her, but  enabled to do her at least this service, that of absorbing the foreign  influences which came, and in certain cases latinising them, and thus  transmitting them to Rome in a more or less assimilated condition.    The three great facts in the life of Rome during this period are the  coming of Greek merchants and Greek trade from the south, the coming of  Etruscan artisans and handicraft from the north, and the beginnings of  her political rivalry and gradual prominence in the league of Latin  cities around her. Each one of these movements is reflected in the  religious changes of the period. In regard to the first two this is not  surprising, for the ancient traveller, like his mythical prototype  Aeneas, carried his gods with him. Thus there were worshipped in private  in Rome the gods of all the peoples who settled within her walls, and  the presence of these gods was destined to make its influence felt. Your  primitive polytheist is very catholic in his religious tastes; for, when  one is already in possession of many gods, the addition of a few more is  a minor matter, especially when, as was now the case in Rome, these  deities are the patrons of occupations and interests hitherto entirely  unknown to the Roman, and hence not provided for in his scheme of gods.  It was therefore in no spirit of disloyalty to the already existing  gods, and with no desire to introduce rival deities, that the new cults  began to spread until they became so important as to call for state  recognition.    Possibly the most interesting cases are those of the two gods who came  from the south, Hercules and Castor, interesting because they were the  forerunners of that great multitude of Greek gods who later came in  proudly by special invitation, and even more interesting yet because,  though they were Greek as Greek could be, they came into Rome, as it  were, incognito, and were so far from being known as Greek, that, when  the same gods came in afterwards more directly, these new-comers were  felt to be quite a different thing, and their worship was carried on in  another part of the city away from the old-established cults.    In the Greek world Herakles and Hermes were the especial patrons of  travellers, and as travelling was never done for pleasure but always for  business, they became the patrons of the travelling merchant. It was  also natural that they should go with the settlers away from the  mother-city into the new colony. Thus it was that they came from the  mother-land into the colonies of Magna Graecia in Southern Italy, and  once being established there made their way slowly but inevitably  northwards. The story of Hermes, under the name of Mercury, belongs to a  later chapter, but that of Herakles = Hercules must be recounted here.  It is only within the last few years that the scholarly world has been  persuaded that there was no such thing as an original Italic Hercules;  at first sight it was very difficult to believe, because there seemed to  be so many apparently very old Italic legends centering in Hercules. But  it has been shown, either that these legends never existed and rest  solely upon false interpretation of monuments, or that, though they did  exist at an early date, they were introduced under Greek influence. It  was the trading merchant therefore who brought Herakles northward. And  as the god went, his name was softened into Hercules, and with the  assimilation of the name to the tongue of the Italic people, there went  hand in hand an adaptation of his nature to their needs, so that by  degrees he became thoroughly italicised both in form and content. It is  probable that the cult came into Rome as well as into the other cities  of Latium, but in Rome it was confined to a few individuals, and at  first obtained no public recognition. On the contrary, for reasons that  we are at a loss to find, this Greek cult seems to have reached very  large proportions in the little town of Tibur (Tivoli), fourteen miles  north-east of Rome. There it dominated all other worship and lost so  much of its foreign atmosphere that it became thoroughly latinised. In  the course of time the Roman state acknowledged this Tivoli cult of  Hercules and accepted a branch of it as its own. But the extraordinary  thing about this acknowledgment is that the Romans felt it to be a Latin  and not a foreign cult. They showed this intimate and friendly feeling  by permitting an altar to Hercules to be erected within the city proper,  in the Forum Boarium. But in order to understand the significance of  this act a word of digression is necessary.    Under the old Roman regime every act of life was performed under the  supervision of the gods, and this godly patronage was especially  emphasised in acts which affected the life of the community. No act was  of greater importance for the community than the choice of a home, the  location of a settlement. Thus the founding of an ancient city was  accompanied by sacred rites, chief among which was the ploughing of a  furrow around the space which was ultimately to be enclosed by the wall.  This furrow formed a symbolic wall on very much the same principle as  that on which the witch draws her circle. The furrow was called the  _pomerium_ and was to the world of the gods what the city wall was to  the world of men. It did not however always coincide with the actual  city wall, and the space it embraced was sometimes less, sometimes more,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18223"],[0,"The Essence of Buddhism (#5)"],[1,"attention to a matter calculated to cause  division.--Patimokkha.
