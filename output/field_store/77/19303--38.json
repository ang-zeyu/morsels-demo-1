I know not,\" exclaimed Henry. \"This adventure surpasses all  belief, and but for the great interest we have in it, I should regard it  with a world of curiosity.\"    \"It is too dreadful,\" said George; \"for God's sake, Henry, let us return  to ascertain if poor Flora is killed.\"    \"My senses,\" said Henry, \"were all so much absorbed in gazing at that  horrible form, that I never once looked towards her further than to see  that she was, to appearance, dead. God help her! poor--poor, beautiful  Flora. This is, indeed, a sad, sad fate for you to come to.  Flora--Flora--\"    \"Do not weep, Henry,\" said George. \"Rather let us now hasten home, where  we may find that tears are premature. She may yet be living and restored  to us.\"    \"And,\" said Mr. Marchdale, \"she may be able to give us some account of  this dreadful visitation.\"    \"True--true,\" exclaimed Henry; \"we will hasten home.\"    They now turned their steps homeward, and as they went they much blamed  themselves for all leaving home together, and with terror pictured what  might occur in their absence to those who were now totally unprotected.    \"It was a rash impulse of us all to come in pursuit of this dreadful  figure,\" remarked Mr. Marchdale; \"but do not torment yourself, Henry.  There may be no reason for your fears.\"    At the pace they went, they very soon reached the ancient house, and  when they came in sight of it, they saw lights flashing from the  windows, and the shadows of faces moving to and fro, indicating that the  whole household was up, and in a state of alarm.    Henry, after some trouble, got the hall door opened by a terrified  servant, who was trembling so much that she could scarcely hold the  light she had with her.    \"Speak at once, Martha,\" said Henry. \"Is Flora living?\"    \"Yes; but--\"    \"Enough--enough! Thank God she lives; where is she now?\"    \"In her own room, Master Henry. Oh, dear--oh, dear, what will become of  us all?\"    Henry rushed up the staircase, followed by George and Mr. Marchdale, nor  paused he once until he reached the room of his sister.    \"Mother,\" he said, before he crossed the threshold, \"are you here?\"    \"I am, my dear--I am. Come in, pray come in, and speak to poor Flora.\"    \"Come in, Mr. Marchdale,\" said Henry--\"come in; we make no stranger of  you.\"    They all then entered the room.    Several lights had been now brought into that antique chamber, and, in  addition to the mother of the beautiful girl who had been so fearfully  visited, there were two female domestics, who appeared to be in the  greatest possible fright, for they could render no assistance whatever  to anybody.    The tears were streaming down the mother's face, and the moment she saw  Mr. Marchdale, she clung to his arm, evidently unconscious of what she  was about, and exclaimed,--    \"Oh, what is this that has happened--what is this? Tell me, Marchdale!  Robert Marchdale, you whom I have known even from my childhood, you will  not deceive me. Tell me the meaning of all this?\"    \"I cannot,\" he said, in a tone of much emotion. \"As God is my judge, I  am as much puzzled and amazed at the scene that has taken place here  to-night as you can be.\"    The mother wrung her hands and wept.    \"It was the storm that first awakened me,\" added Marchdale; \"and then I  heard a scream.\"    The brothers tremblingly approached the bed. Flora was placed in a  sitting, half-reclining posture, propped up by pillows. She was quite  insensible, and her face was fearfully pale; while that she breathed at  all could be but very faintly seen. On some of her clothing, about the  neck, were spots of blood, and she looked more like one who had suffered  some long and grievous illness, than a young girl in the prime of life  and in the most robust health, as she had been on the day previous to  the strange scene we have recorded.    \"Does she sleep?\" said Henry, as a tear fell from his eyes upon her  pallid cheek.    \"No,\" replied Mr. Marchdale. \"This is a swoon, from which we must  recover her.\"    Active measures were now adopted to restore the languid circulation,  and, after persevering in them for some time, they had the satisfaction  of seeing her open her eyes.    Her first act upon consciousness returning, however, was to utter a loud  shriek, and it was not until Henry implored her to look around her, and  see that she was surrounded by none but friendly faces, that she would  venture again to open her eyes, and look timidly from one to the other.  Then she shuddered, and burst into tears as she said,--    \"Oh, Heaven, have mercy upon me--Heaven, have mercy upon me, and save me  from that dreadful form.\"    \"There is no one here, Flora,\" said Mr. Marchdale, \"but those who love  you, and who, in defence of you, if needs were would lay down their  lives.\"    \"Oh, God! Oh, God!\"    \"You have been terrified. But tell us distinctly what has happened? You  are quite safe now.\"    [Illustration]    She trembled so violently that Mr. Marchdale recommended that some  stimulant should be given to her, and she was persuaded, although not  without considerable difficulty, to swallow a small portion of some wine  from a cup. There could be no doubt but that the stimulating effect of  the wine was beneficial, for a slight accession of colour visited her  cheeks, and she spoke in a firmer tone as she said,--    \"Do not leave me. Oh, do not leave me, any of you. I shall die if left  alone now. Oh, save me--save me. That horrible form! That fearful face!\"    \"Tell us how it happened, dear Flora?\" said Henry.    \"Or would you rather endeavour to get some sleep first?\" suggested Mr.  Marchdale.    \"No--no--no,\" she said, \"I do not think I shall ever sleep again.\"    \"Say not so; you will be more composed in a few hours, and then you can  tell us what has occurred.\"    \"I will tell you now. I will tell you now.\"    She placed her hands over her face for a moment, as if to collect her  scattered, thoughts, and then she added,--    \"I was awakened by the storm, and I saw that terrible apparition at the  window. I think I screamed, but I could not fly. Oh, God! I could not  fly. It came--it seized me by the hair. I know no more. I know no more.\"    She passed her hand across her neck several times, and Mr. Marchdale  said, in an anxious voice,--    \"You seem, Flora, to have hurt your neck--there is a wound.\"    \"A wound!\" said the mother, and she brought a light close to the bed,  where all saw on the side of Flora's neck a small punctured wound; or,  rather two, for there was one a little distance from the other.    It was from these wounds the blood had come which was observable upon  her night clothing.    \"How came these wounds?\" said Henry.    \"I do not know,\" she replied. \"I feel very faint and weak, as if I had  almost bled to death.\"    \"You cannot have done so, dear Flora, for there are not above  half-a-dozen spots of blood to be seen at all.\"    Mr. Marchdale leaned against the carved head of the bed for support, and  he uttered a deep groan. All eyes were turned upon him, and Henry said,  in a voice of the most anxious inquiry,--    \"You have something to say, Mr. Marchdale, which will throw some light  upon this affair.\"    \"No, no, no, nothing!\" cried Mr. Marchdale, rousing himself at once from  the appearance of depression that had come over him. \"I have nothing to  say, but that I think Flora had better get some sleep if she can.\"    \"No sleep-no sleep for me,\" again screamed Flora. \"Dare I be alone to  sleep?\"    \"But you shall not be alone, dear Flora,\" said Henry. \"I will sit by  your bedside and watch you.\"    She took his hand in both hers, and while the tears chased each other  down her cheeks, she said,--    \"Promise me, Henry, by all your hopes of Heaven, you will not leave me.\"    \"I promise!\"    She gently laid herself down, with a deep sigh, and closed her eyes.    \"She is weak, and will sleep long,\" said Mr. Marchdale.    \"You sigh,\" said Henry. \"Some fearful thoughts, I feel certain, oppress  your heart.\"    \"Hush-hush!\" said Mr. Marchdale, as he pointed to Flora. \"Hush! not  here--not here.\"    \"I understand,\" said Henry.    \"Let her sleep.\"    There was a silence of some few minutes duration. Flora had dropped into  a deep slumber. That silence was first broken by George, who said,--    \"Mr. Marchdale, look at that portrait.\"    He pointed to the portrait in the frame to which we have alluded, and  the moment Marchdale looked at it he sunk into a chair as he  exclaimed,--    \"Gracious Heaven, how like!\"    \"It is--it is,\" said Henry. \"Those eyes--\"    \"And see the contour of the countenance, and the strange shape of the  mouth.\"    \"Exact--exact.\"    \"That picture shall be moved from here. The sight of it is at once  sufficient to awaken all her former terrors in poor Flora's brain if she  should chance to awaken and cast her eyes suddenly upon it.\"    \"And is it so like him who came here?\" said the mother.    \"It is the very man himself,\" said Mr. Marchdale. \"I have not been in  this house long enough to ask any of you whose portrait that may be?\"    \"It is,\" said Henry, \"the portrait of Sir Runnagate Bannerworth, an  ancestor of ours, who first, by his vices, gave the great blow to the  family prosperity.\"    \"Indeed. How long ago?\"    \"About ninety years.\"    \"Ninety years. 'Tis a long while--ninety years.\"    \"You muse upon it.\"    \"No, no. I do wish, and yet I dread--\"    \"What?\"    \"To say something to you all. But not here--not here. We will hold a  consultation on this matter to-morrow. Not now--not now.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14835"],[0,"The Burglar and the Blizzard: A Christmas Story (#5)"],[1,". I tell her that if it were known that I had held such a poor  position, it would interfere with my getting a better. So, if you should  happen to find that you have to explain to her why I am detained here--\"    \"_If_ I should explain to her,\" said Geoffrey. \"What do you suppose I am  going to do?\"    \"Well, I suppose you will find it necessary,\" said McVay. \"Indeed, as a  matter of fact, I would much rather have you do it than do it myself.  Still, you might bear in mind to tell her as gently as possible. If she  were your own sister--\"    \"Oh, go to the devil,\" said Geoffrey, and slammed the door.          III      Geoffrey was born with a love of adventure, and his dislike to his  present expedition arose not from fear, but from a consciousness that if  he did run into a den of thieves he would think himself such an ass to  have come. Indeed, there seemed a fair chance that he might think this  even if nothing worse happened than that the hut proved empty, for he  would have had a long walk for nothing better than to provide McVay with  an opportunity to escape. He did not see exactly how McVay could get  out, but he was aware that few people would think it wise to leave a  burglar locked in a closet in an empty house with some hours of leisure  at his disposal.    The first glimmering of dawn was visible as he stepped off the piazza;  the wind was blowing fiercely and the snow still falling. He had not  gone a hundred yards before he knew that the expedition was to be more  difficult than he had imagined. To make headway against the wind was a  constant struggle, and he seemed to slip back in the snow at every step.  Still the natural obstinacy of his nature was aroused, and as his  attention was more and more engaged with the endeavor to make his way,  he had less time to think of the probable futility of his proceeding.    Long before he sighted the hut, he was wet to the waist, not only  because he had been in half a dozen drifts, but because the snow had  penetrated every crevice of his clothing.    The hut was a forlorn little spot upon the landscape, a patch of grey on  the stretch of forest and snow. A shutter blowing in the wind gave an  impression of desertion, for how could any one, however wretched, sit  idle under that recurrent bang?    Drawing his revolver, Geoffrey approached the door. He had no intention  of giving a possible enemy an opportunity to prepare himself, and so did  not knock, but, putting his shoulder against the door, shoved mightily.  The hinges broke from the rotten wood at once, and he stumbled in.    The pale light of the early winter morning showed a depressing interior,  for the window was not the only opening. There was a great gap in the  roof where, earlier in the night, the chimney had fallen, and now its  bricks littered the floor, already well covered with snow. Some attempt  must have been made, as McVay had boasted, of \"fixing it up\"; there were  books in the shelves on the walls, and a black iron stove on which the  snow now lay fearlessly. As Geoffrey took in the situation, something in  a huge chair, which he had taken for a heap of rugs, stirred and moved,  and finally rose, betraying itself to be a woman. Geoffrey had been  prepared to find a den of thieves, or nothing at all, or even a girl, as  McVay had said. He told himself he would be surprised at nothing, yet  found himself astounded, overwhelmed at the sight of a beautiful face.    The girl must have been beautiful so to triumph over her surroundings,  for all sorts of strange garments were huddled about her, and over all a  silk coverlet originally tied like a shawl under her chin, had slipped  sideways, and fell like a Hussar's jacket from one shoulder. Her hair  stood like a dark halo about her little face, making it seem smaller and  younger, almost too small for the magnificent eyes that lit it.  Geoffrey, tolerably well versed in feminine attractions, said to himself  that he had never seen such blue eyes.    And suddenly while he looked at her and her desperate plight, pity  became in him a sort of fury of protection, the awakening of the  masculine instinct toward beauty in distress. It was a feeling that the  other women he had admired--well-fed, well-clothed, well-cared-for young  creatures--had always signally failed to arouse. He had seen it in other  men, had seen their hearts wrung because an able-bodied girl must take a  trolley car instead of her father's carriage, but he had thought himself  hard, perhaps, unchivalrous; but now he knew better. Now he knew what it  was to feel personally outraged at a woman's discomfort.    \"Good God!\" he cried, \"what a night you have had. How wicked, how  abominable, how criminal--\"    [Illustration: \"GOOD GOD,\" HE CRIED \"WHAT A NIGHT YOU HAVE HAD\"]    \"It has been a dreadful night,\" said the girl, \"but it is nobody's  fault.\"    \"Of course it is somebody's fault,\" answered Geoffrey. \"It must be. Do  you mean to tell me no one is to blame when I have been sitting all  night with my feet on the fender, and you--\"    \"Certainly,\" said she with an extraordinarily wide, sweet smile, \"I  could wish we might have changed places.\"    \"I wish to Heaven we might,\" returned Geoffrey, and meant it. Never  before had he yearned to bear the sufferings of another. He had often  seen that it was advisable, suitable just that he should, but burningly  to want to was a new experience.    \"Thank you,\" said the girl, \"but I'm afraid there is nothing to be  done.\"    \"Nothing to be done!\" He dropped on his knees before the black monster  of a stove, \"Do you suppose I'm here to do nothing?\"    \"You are here, I think, for shelter from the storm.\"    It had not occurred to him before that she looked upon him as a chance  wanderer.    \"That shows your ignorance of the situation. I am here to rescue you. I  left my fireside for no other reason. As I came along I said at every  blast, 'that poor, poor girl.' I set out to bring you to safety. I begin  to think I was born for no other reason.\"    She smiled rather wearily, \"Your coming at all is so strange that I  could almost believe you.\"    \"You may thoroughly believe me, more easily perhaps when I tell you I  did not particularly want to come. I started out at dawn very cross and  cold because I did not know what I was going to find....\"    \"But I thought you said you did know that you were going to rescue a  girl?\"    \"A girl, yes. But what's a mere girl? How many thousand girls have I  seen in my life? Is that a thought to turn a man's head? What I did not  know was that I was going to find _you_.\"    \"The fire will never burn with the chimney strewn on the floor,\" she  said mildly.    \"Well, I've said it, you see,\" he answered, \"and you won't forget it,  even if you do change the subject.\" He turned his attention to the fire.  Where is the man, worthy of the name to whom the business of fire  building is not serious?    Presently seeing he needed help she dropped to her knees beside him and  tried to shove a piece of wood into place. In the process her numbed  fingers touched his, and he instantly dropped everything to catch her  hand in both of his.    \"Your hands are as cold as ice,\" he said, holding them tightly, and  thanking Fate that this bounty had fallen to his lot.    She withdrew them. \"You are too conscientious,\" she said. \"That is not  part of the duty of a rescue party.\"    \"It is, it is,\" said Geoffrey violently. \"It is the merest humanity.\"    \"Humanity?\"    \"To me, of course, if you will pin me down.\"    \"Oh, there is no reason for the rescued to be humane.\"    \"They ought to be grateful.\"    \"They are.\"    \"_Gratefuller_ then. Is it nothing that I have taken all the trouble to  be born and grow up and live just to come here for you?\"    \"Perhaps I could be gratefuller if there were any prospect of a fire.\"    \"Oh, curse the fire,\" said Geoffrey rising from his knees. \"Who minds  about it?\"    \"I mind very much.\"    \"Well, you mustn't. You must not mind about anything, because it sets up  too strong a reaction in me. There's no telling what I might not do  under the stress. Come away from this dreadful place. The fires will  burn in my house, and that is where we are going.\"    \"I can't do that,\" she said, looking very grave.    \"You can't do anything else.\"    \"I must wait for my brother. He's out somewhere in this storm, and if he  comes back and finds me gone--\"    \"Oh, your brother,\" said Geoffrey, \"I forgot all about him. He's at my  house already. He sent me for you.\"    \"Oh,\" said she, sighing with relief, and then added maliciously: \"then  my plight was not revealed to you in a vision?\"    \"The vision is with me now.\"    She had to perfection, the art of allowing her mind to drift away when  she thought it advisable.    \"And so you took poor Billy in?\" she said.    Geoffrey coughed. \"Well, in a sense,\" he answered.    She rose. \"We'll go at once,\" she said. \"Is it far?\"    \"Not very, but it is going to be hard work.\"    He felt more practical. His delight had slipped from him at the  realisation of her relationship to McVay. For a moment he felt  depressed, then as he saw her struggling to undo the knot that held the  comforter about her, he forgot everything but the pleasure of doing her  a service. And in the midst of this joy, the coverlet slid to the ground  and revealed her clad from head to foot in his sister's sables.    There was a pause.    \"What are you looking at?\" she asked.    \"That is a nice warm coat you have on.\"    \"Isn't it?\" She rubbed her cheek against the high collar with a  tenderness trying to any masculine onlooker. \"It saved my life.\"    It was on the tip of Geoffrey's tongue to ask if he was not entitled to  a similar claim on her consideration, but he suppressed it. Was it  possible that she did not know that the garments she wore were stolen?  Could any sane woman really believe that sable coats fell naturally to  the lot of night watchmen? Her manner was candour"]]]
