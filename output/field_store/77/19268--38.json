The dressing-table, for instance, was a  packing-case in a sprigged muslin petticoat, and the mirror above was  very strange; it was as though a little piece of forked lightning was  imprisoned in it. On the table there stood a jar of sea-pinks, pressed  so tightly together they looked more like a velvet pincushion, and a  special shell which Kezia had given her grandma for a pin-tray, and  another even more special which she had thought would make a very nice  place for a watch to curl up in.    \"Tell me, grandma,\" said Kezia.    The old woman sighed, whipped the wool twice round her thumb, and drew  the bone needle through. She was casting on.    \"I was thinking of your Uncle William, darling,\" she said quietly.    \"My Australian Uncle William?\" said Kezia. She had another.    \"Yes, of course.\"    \"The one I never saw?\"    \"That was the one.\"    \"Well, what happened to him?\" Kezia knew perfectly well, but she wanted  to be told again.    \"He went to the mines, and he got a sunstroke there and died,\" said old  Mrs. Fairfield.    Kezia blinked and considered the picture again... a little man fallen  over like a tin soldier by the side of a big black hole.    \"Does it make you sad to think about him, grandma?\" She hated her  grandma to be sad.    It was the old woman's turn to consider. Did it make her sad? To look  back, back. To stare down the years, as Kezia had seen her doing. To  look after them as a woman does, long after they were out of sight. Did  it make her sad? No, life was like that.    \"No, Kezia.\"    \"But why?\" asked Kezia. She lifted one bare arm and began to draw things  in the air. \"Why did Uncle William have to die? He wasn't old.\"    Mrs. Fairfield began counting the stitches in threes. \"It just  happened,\" she said in an absorbed voice.    \"Does everybody have to die?\" asked Kezia.    \"Everybody!\"    \"Me?\" Kezia sounded fearfully incredulous.    \"Some day, my darling.\"    \"But, grandma.\" Kezia waved her left leg and waggled the toes. They felt  sandy. \"What if I just won't?\"    The old woman sighed again and drew a long thread from the ball.    \"We're not asked, Kezia,\" she said sadly. \"It happens to all of us  sooner or later.\"    Kezia lay still thinking this over. She didn't want to die. It meant she  would have to leave here, leave everywhere, for ever, leave--leave her  grandma. She rolled over quickly.    \"Grandma,\" she said in a startled voice.    \"What, my pet!\"    \"You're not to die.\" Kezia was very decided.    \"Ah, Kezia\"--her grandma looked up and smiled and shook her head--\"don't  let's talk about it.\"    \"But you're not to. You couldn't leave me. You couldn't not be there.\"  This was awful. \"Promise me you won't ever do it, grandma,\" pleaded  Kezia.    The old woman went on knitting.    \"Promise me! Say never!\"    But still her grandma was silent.    Kezia rolled off her bed; she couldn't bear it any longer, and lightly  she leapt on to her grandma's knees, clasped her hands round the old  woman's throat and began kissing her, under the chin, behind the ear,  and blowing down her neck.    \"Say never... say never... say never--\" She gasped between the kisses. And  then she began, very softly and lightly, to tickle her grandma.    \"Kezia!\" The old woman dropped her knitting. She swung back in the  rocker. She began to tickle Kezia. \"Say never, say never, say never,\"  gurgled Kezia, while they lay there laughing in each other's arms.  \"Come, that's enough, my squirrel! That's enough, my wild pony!\" said  old Mrs. Fairfield, setting her cap straight. \"Pick up my knitting.\"    Both of them had forgotten what the \"never\" was about.      Chapter 1.VIII.    The sun was still full on the garden when the back door of the Burnells'  shut with a bang, and a very gay figure walked down the path to the  gate. It was Alice, the servant-girl, dressed for her afternoon out. She  wore a white cotton dress with such large red spots on it and so many  that they made you shudder, white shoes and a leghorn turned up under  the brim with poppies. Of course she wore gloves, white ones, stained  at the fastenings with iron-mould, and in one hand she carried a very  dashed-looking sunshade which she referred to as her \"perishall.\"    Beryl, sitting in the window, fanning her freshly-washed hair, thought  she had never seen such a guy. If Alice had only blacked her face with  a piece of cork before she started out, the picture would have been  complete. And where did a girl like that go to in a place like this? The  heart-shaped Fijian fan beat scornfully at that lovely bright mane. She  supposed Alice had picked up some horrible common larrikin and they'd  go off into the bush together. Pity to have made herself so conspicuous;  they'd have hard work to hide with Alice in that rig-out.    But no, Beryl was unfair. Alice was going to tea with Mrs Stubbs, who'd  sent her an \"invite\" by the little boy who called for orders. She had  taken ever such a liking to Mrs. Stubbs ever since the first time she  went to the shop to get something for her mosquitoes.    \"Dear heart!\" Mrs. Stubbs had clapped her hand to her side. \"I never  seen anyone so eaten. You might have been attacked by canningbals.\"    Alice did wish there'd been a bit of life on the road though. Made her  feel so queer, having nobody behind her. Made her feel all weak in the  spine. She couldn't believe that some one wasn't watching her. And yet  it was silly to turn round; it gave you away. She pulled up her gloves,  hummed to herself and said to the distant gum-tree, \"Shan't be long  now.\" But that was hardly company.    Mrs. Stubbs's shop was perched on a little hillock just off the road. It  had two big windows for eyes, a broad veranda for a hat, and the sign on  the roof, scrawled MRS. STUBBS'S, was like a little card stuck rakishly  in the hat crown.    On the veranda there hung a long string of bathing-dresses, clinging  together as though they'd just been rescued from the sea rather than  waiting to go in, and beside them there hung a cluster of sandshoes so  extraordinarily mixed that to get at one pair you had to tear apart and  forcibly separate at least fifty. Even then it was the rarest thing  to find the left that belonged to the right. So many people had lost  patience and gone off with one shoe that fitted and one that was a  little too big... Mrs. Stubbs prided herself on keeping something  of everything. The two windows, arranged in the form of precarious  pyramids, were crammed so tight, piled so high, that it seemed only a  conjurer could prevent them from toppling over. In the left-hand corner  of one window, glued to the pane by four gelatine lozenges, there  was--and there had been from time immemorial--a notice.    LOST! HANSOME GOLE BROOCH SOLID GOLD ON OR NEAR BEACH REWARD OFFERED    Alice pressed open the door. The bell jangled, the red serge curtains  parted, and Mrs. Stubbs appeared. With her broad smile and the long  bacon knife in her hand, she looked like a friendly brigand. Alice was  welcomed so warmly that she found it quite difficult to keep up her  \"manners.\" They consisted of persistent little coughs and hems, pulls at  her gloves, tweaks at her skirt, and a curious difficulty in seeing what  was set before her or understanding what was said.    Tea was laid on the parlour table--ham, sardines, a whole pound  of butter, and such a large johnny cake that it looked like an  advertisement for somebody's baking-powder. But the Primus stove roared  so loudly that it was useless to try to talk above it. Alice sat down  on the edge of a basket-chair while Mrs. Stubbs pumped the stove  still higher. Suddenly Mrs. Stubbs whipped the cushion off a chair and  disclosed a large brown-paper parcel.    \"I've just had some new photers taken, my dear,\" she shouted cheerfully  to Alice. \"Tell me what you think of them.\"    In a very dainty, refined way Alice wet her finger and put the tissue  back from the first one. Life! How many there were! There were three  dozzing at least. And she held it up to the light.    Mrs. Stubbs sat in an arm-chair, leaning very much to one side. There  was a look of mild astonishment on her large face, and well there might  be. For though the arm-chair stood on a carpet, to the left of it,  miraculously skirting the carpet-border, there was a dashing water-fall.  On her right stood a Grecian pillar with a giant fern-tree on either  side of it, and in the background towered a gaunt mountain, pale with  snow.    \"It is a nice style, isn't it?\" shouted Mrs. Stubbs; and Alice had  just screamed \"Sweetly\" when the roaring of the Primus stove died  down, fizzled out, ceased, and she said \"Pretty\" in a silence that was  frightening.    \"Draw up your chair, my dear,\" said Mrs. Stubbs, beginning to pour out.  \"Yes,\" she said thoughtfully, as she handed the tea, \"but I don't care  about the size. I'm having an enlargemint. All very well for Christmas  cards, but I never was the one for small photers myself. You get no  comfort out of them. To say the truth, I find them dis'eartening.\"    Alice quite saw what she meant.    \"Size,\" said Mrs. Stubbs. \"Give me size. That was what my poor dear  husband was always saying. He couldn't stand anything small. Gave him  the creeps. And, strange as it may seem, my dear\"--here Mrs. Stubbs  creaked and seemed to expand herself at the memory--\"it was dropsy that  carried him off at the larst. Many's the time they drawn one and a half  pints from 'im at the 'ospital... It seemed like a judgmint.\"    Alice burned to know exactly what it was that was drawn from him. She  ventured, \"I suppose it was water.\"    But Mrs. Stubbs fixed Alice with her eyes and replied meaningly, \"It was  liquid, my dear.\"    Liquid! Alice jumped away from the word like a cat and came back to it,  nosing and wary.    \"That's 'im!\" said Mrs. Stubbs, and she pointed dramatically to the  life-size head and shoulders of a burly man with a dead white rose in  the buttonhole of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14291"],[0,"The Story of Geographical Discovery: How the World Became Known (#5)"],[1,"held sway over the west  of Asia at the dawn of history. Modern discoveries of remarkable  interest have enabled us to learn the condition of men in Asia  Minor as early as 4000 B.C. All these early civilisations existed  on the banks of great rivers, which rendered the land fertile through  which they passed.    We first find man conscious of himself, and putting his knowledge  on record, along the banks of the great rivers Nile, Euphrates,  and Tigris, Ganges and Yang-tse-Kiang. But for our purposes we  are not concerned with these very early stages of history. The  Egyptians got to know something of the nations that surrounded  them, and so did the Assyrians. A summary of similar knowledge  is contained in the list of tribes given in the tenth chapter of  Genesis, which divides all mankind, as then known to the Hebrews,  into descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japhet--corresponding, roughly,  to Asia, Europe, and Africa. But in order to ascertain how the  Romans obtained the mass of information which was summarised for  them by Ptolemy in his great work, we have merely to concentrate  our attention on the remarkable process of continuous expansion  which ultimately led to the existence of the Roman Empire.    All early histories of kingdoms are practically of the same type.  A certain tract of country is divided up among a certain number  of tribes speaking a common language, and each of these tribes  ruled by a separate chieftain. One of these tribes then becomes  predominant over the rest, through the skill in war or diplomacy  of one of its chiefs, and the whole of the tract of country is thus  organised into one kingdom. Thus the history of England relates  how the kingdom of Wessex grew into predominance over the whole  of the country; that of France tells how the kings who ruled over  the Isle of France spread their rule over the rest of the land;  the history of Israel is mainly an account of how the tribe of  Judah obtained the hegemony of the rest of the tribes; and Roman  history, as its name implies, informs us how the inhabitants of  a single city grew to be the masters of the whole known world.  But their empire had been prepared for them by a long series of  similar expansions, which might be described as the successive  swallowing up of empire after empire, each becoming overgrown in  the process, till at last the series was concluded by the Romans  swallowing up the whole. It was this gradual spread of dominion  which, at each stage, increased men's knowledge of surrounding  nations, and it therefore comes within our province to roughly sum  up these stages, as part of the story of geographical discovery.    Regarded from the point of view of geography, this spread of man's  knowledge might be compared to the growth of a huge oyster-shell,  and, from that point of view, we have to take the north of the  Persian Gulf as the apex of the shell, and begin with the Babylonian  Empire. We first have the kingdom of Babylon--which, in the early  stages, might be best termed Chaldaea--in the south of Mesopotamia  (or the valley between the two rivers, Tigris and Euphrates), which,  during the third and second millennia before our era, spread along  the valley of the Tigris. But in the fourteenth century B.C., the  Assyrians to the north of it, though previously dependent upon  Babylon, conquered it, and, after various vicissitudes, established  themselves throughout the whole of Mesopotamia and much of the  surrounding lands. In 604 B.C. the capital of this great empire was  moved once more to Babylon, so that in the last stage, as well as in  the first, it may be called Babylonia. For purposes of distinction,  however, it will be as well to call these three successive stages  Chaldaea, Assyria, and Babylonia.    Meanwhile, immediately to the east, a somewhat similar process  had been gone through, though here the development was from north  to south, the Medes of the north developing a powerful empire in  the north of Persia, which ultimately fell into the hands of Cyrus  the Great in 546 B.C. He then proceeded to conquer the kingdom of  Lydia, in the northwest part of Asia Minor, which had previously  inherited the dominions of the Hittites. Finally he proceeded to  seize the empire of Babylonia, by his successful attack on the  capital, 538 B.C. He extended his rule nearly as far as India on  one side, and, as we know from the Bible, to the borders of Egypt  on the other. His son Cambyses even succeeded in adding Egypt for  a time to the Persian Empire. The oyster-shell of history had  accordingly expanded to include almost the whole of Western Asia.    The next two centuries are taken up in universal history by the  magnificent struggle of the Greeks against the Persian Empire--the  most decisive conflict in all history, for it determined whether  Europe or Asia should conquer the world. Hitherto the course of  conquest had been from east to west, and if Xerxes' invasion had  been successful, there is little doubt that the westward tendency  would have continued. But the larger the tract of country which an  empire covers--especially when different tribes and nations are  included in it--the weaker and less organised it becomes. Within  little more than a century of the death of Cyrus the Great the  Greeks discovered the vulnerable point in the Persian Empire, owing  to an expedition of ten thousand Greek mercenaries under Xenophon,  who had been engaged by Cyrus the younger in an attempt to capture  the Persian Empire from his brother. Cyrus was slain, 401 B.C., but  the ten thousand, under the leadership of Xenophon, were enabled,  to hold their own against all the attempts of the Persians to destroy  them, and found their way back to Greece.    Meanwhile the usual process had been going on in Greece by which a  country becomes consolidated. From time to time one of the tribes  into which that mountainous country was divided obtained supremacy  over the rest: at first the Athenians, owing to the prominent part  they had taken in repelling the Persians; then the Spartans, and  finally the Thebans. But on the northern frontiers a race of hardy  mountaineers, the Macedonians, had consolidated their power, and,  under Philip of Macedon, became masters of all Greece. Philip had  learned the lesson taught by the successful retreat of the ten  thousand, and, just before his death, was preparing to attack the  Great King (of Persia) with all the forces which his supremacy in  Greece put at his disposal. His son Alexander the Great carried  out Philip's intentions. Within twelve years (334-323 B.C.) he had  conquered Persia, Parthia, India (in the strict sense, _i.e._ the  valley of the Indus), and Egypt. After his death his huge empire  was divided up among his generals, but, except in the extreme east,  the whole of it was administered on Greek methods. A Greek-speaking  person could pass from one end to the other without difficulty, and  we can understand how a knowledge of the whole tract of country  between the Adriatic and the Indus could be obtained by Greek scholars.  Alexander founded a large number of cities, all bearing his name, at  various points of his itinerary; but of these the most important  was that at the mouth of the Nile, known to this day as Alexandria.  Here was the intellectual centre of the whole Hellenic world, and  accordingly it was here, as we have seen, that Eratosthenes first  wrote down in a systematic manner all the knowledge about the habitable  earth which had been gained mainly by Alexander's conquests.    Important as was the triumphant march of Alexander through Western  Asia, both in history and in geography, it cannot be said to have  added so very much to geographical knowledge, for Herodotus was  roughly acquainted with most of the country thus traversed, except  towards the east of Persia and the north-west of India. But the  itineraries of Alexander and his generals must have contributed  more exact knowledge of the distances between the various important  centres of population, and enabled Eratosthenes and his successors  to give them a definite position on their maps of the world. What  they chiefly learned from Alexander and his immediate successors  was a more accurate knowledge of North-West India. Even as late  as Strabo, the sole knowledge possessed at Alexandria of Indian  places was that given by Megasthenes, the ambassador to India in  the third century B.C.    Meanwhile, in the western portion of the civilised world a similar  process had gone on. In the Italian peninsula the usual struggle  had gone on between the various tribes inhabiting it. The fertile  plain of Lombardy was not in those days regarded as belonging to  Italy, but was known as Cisalpine Gaul. The south of Italy, as we  have seen, was mainly inhabited by Greek colonists, and was called  Great Greece. Between these tracts of country the Italian territory  was inhabited by three sets of federate tribes--the Etrurians,  the Samnites, and the Latins. During the 230 years between 510  B.C. and 280 B.C. Rome was occupied in obtaining the supremacy  among these three sets of tribes, and by the latter date may be  regarded as having consolidated Central Italy into an Italian  federation, centralised at Rome. At the latter date, the Greek  king Pyrrhus of Epirus, attempted to arouse the Greek colonies  in Southern Italy against the growing power of Rome; but his  interference only resulted in extending the Roman dominion down  to the heel and big toe of Italy.    If Rome was to advance farther, Sicily would be the next step,  and just at that moment Sicily was being threatened by the other  great power of the West--Carthage. Carthage was the most important  of the colonies founded by the Phoenicians (probably in the ninth  century B.C.), and pursued in the Western Mediterranean the policy  of establishing trading stations along the coast, which had  distinguished the Phoenicians from"]]]
