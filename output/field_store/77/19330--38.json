Chariots with upper storeys or  spy-towers were used for fighting in narrow defiles, and hollow squares  were formed of mixed chariots, infantry, and dragoons. The weakness of  disunion of forces was well understood. In the sixth century A.D. the  massed troops numbered about a million and a quarter. In A.D. 627  there was an efficient standing army of 900,000 men, the term of  service being from the ages of twenty to sixty. During the Mongol  dynasty (1280-1368) there was a navy of 5000 ships manned by 70,000  trained fighters. The Mongols completely revolutionized tactics and  improved on all the military knowledge of the time. In 1614 the Manchu  'Eight Banners,' composed of Manchus, Mongolians, and Chinese, were  instituted. The provincial forces, designated the Army of the Green  Standard, were divided into land forces and marine forces, superseded  on active service by 'braves' (_yung_), or irregulars, enlisted and  discharged according to circumstances. After the war with Japan in  1894 reforms were seriously undertaken, with the result that the army  has now been modernized in dress, weapons, tactics, etc., and is by  no means a negligible quantity in the world's fighting forces. A  modern navy is also being acquired by building and purchase. For  many centuries the soldier, being, like the priest, unproductive,  was regarded with disdain, and now that his indispensableness for  defensive purposes is recognized he has to fight not only any actual  enemy who may attack him, but those far subtler forces from over the  sea which seem likely to obtain supremacy in his military councils,  if not actual control of his whole military system. It is, in my view,  the duty of Western nations to take steps before it is too late to  avert this great disaster.      Ecclesiastical Institutions    The dancing and chanting exorcists called _wu_ were the first Chinese  priests, with temples containing gods worshipped and sacrificed  to, but there was no special sacerdotal class. Worship of Heaven  could only be performed by the king or emperor. Ecclesiastical and  political functions were not completely separated. The king was  _pontifex maximus_, the nobles, statesmen, and civil and military  officers acted as priests, the ranks being similar to those of the  political hierarchy. Worship took place in the 'Hall of Light,'  which was also a palace and audience and council chamber. Sacrifices  were offered to Heaven, the hills and rivers, ancestors, and all the  spirits. Dancing held a conspicuous place in worship. Idols are spoken  of in the earliest times.    Of course, each religion, as it formed itself out of the original  ancestor-worship, had its own sacred places, functionaries,  observances, ceremonial. Thus, at the State worship of Heaven, Nature,  etc., there were the 'Great,' 'Medium,' and 'Inferior' sacrifices,  consisting of animals, silk, grain, jade, etc. Panegyrics were sung,  and robes of appropriate colour worn. In spring, summer, autumn,  and winter there were the seasonal sacrifices at the appropriate  altars. Taoism and Buddhism had their temples, monasteries, priests,  sacrifices, and ritual; and there were village and wayside temples  and shrines to ancestors, the gods of thunder, rain, wind, grain,  agriculture, and many others. Now encouraged, now tolerated, now  persecuted, the ecclesiastical _personnel_ and structure of Taoism and  Buddhism survived into modern times, when we find complete schemes  of ecclesiastical gradations of rank and authority grafted upon  these two priestly hierarchies, and their temples, priests, etc.,  fulfilling generally, with worship of ancestors, State or official  (Confucianism) and private or unofficial, and the observance of various  annual festivals, such as 'All Souls' Day' for wandering and hungry  ghosts, the spiritual needs of the people as the 'Three Religions'  (_San Chiao_). The emperor, as high priest, took the responsibility  for calamities, etc., making confession to Heaven and praying that  as a punishment the evil be diverted from the people to his own  person. Statesmen, nobles, and officials discharged, as already noted,  priestly functions in connexion with the State religion in addition  to their ordinary duties. As a rule, priests proper, frowned upon as  non-producers, were recruited from the lower classes, were celibate,  unintellectual, idle, and immoral. There was nothing, even in the  elaborate ceremonies on special occasions in the Buddhist temples,  which could be likened to what is known as 'public worship' and  'common prayer' in the West. Worship had for its sole object either  the attainment of some good or the prevention of some evil.    Generally this represents the state of things under the Republican  _regime_; the chief differences being greater neglect of ecclesiastical  matters and the conversion of a large number of temples into schools.      Professional Institutions    We read of physicians, blind musicians, poets, teachers, prayer-makers,  architects, scribes, painters, diviners, ceremonialists, orators,  and others during the Feudal Period, These professions were of  ecclesiastical origin, not yet completely differentiated from the  'Church,' and both in earlier and later times not always or often  differentiated from each other. Thus the historiographers combined the  duties of statesmen, scholars, authors, and generals. The professions  of authors and teachers, musicians and poets, were united in one  person. And so it continued to the present day. Priests discharge  medical functions, poets still sing their verses. But experienced  medical specialists, though few, are to be found, as well as women  doctors; there are veterinary surgeons, musicians (chiefly belonging  to the poorest classes and often blind), actors, teachers, attorneys,  diviners, artists, letter-writers, and many others, men of letters  being perhaps the most prominent and most esteemed.        Accessory Institutions    A system of schools, academies, colleges, and universities obtained in  villages, districts, departments, and principalities. The instruction  was divided into 'Primary Learning' and 'Great Learning.' There were  special schools of dancing and music. Libraries and almshouses for  old men are mentioned. Associations of scholars for literary purposes  seem to have been numerous.    Whatever form and direction education might have taken, it became  stereotyped at an early age by the road to office being made to  lead through a knowledge of the classical writings of the ancient  sages. It became not only 'the thing' to be well versed in the sayings  of Confucius, Mencius; etc., and to be able to compose good essays on  them containing not a single wrongly written character, but useless  for aspirants to office--who constituted practically the whole of the  literary class--to acquire any other knowledge. So obsessed was the  national mind by this literary mania that even infants' spines were  made to bend so as to produce when adult the 'scholarly stoop.' And  from the fact that besides the scholar class the rest of the community  consisted of agriculturists, artisans, and merchants, whose knowledge  was that of their fathers and grandfathers, inculcated in the sons  and grandsons as it had been in them, showing them how to carry on  in the same groove the calling to which Fate had assigned them, a  departure from which would have been considered 'unfilial'--unless,  of course (as it very rarely did), it went the length of attaining  through study of the classics a place in the official class, and thus  shedding eternal lustre on the family--it will readily be seen that  there was nothing to cause education to be concerned with any but one  or two of the subjects which are included by Western peoples under  that designation. It became at an early age, and remained for many  centuries, a rote-learning of the elementary text-books, followed by  a similar acquisition by heart of the texts of the works of Confucius  and other classical writers. And so it remained until the abolition, in  1905, of the old competitive examination system, and the substitution  of all that is included in the term 'modern education' at schools,  colleges, and universities all over the country, in which there is  rapidly growing up a force that is regenerating the Chinese people,  and will make itself felt throughout the whole world.    It is this keen and shrewd appreciation of the learned, and this lust  for knowledge, which, barring the tragedy of foreign domination, will  make China, in the truest and best sense of the word, a great nation,  where, as in the United States of America, the rigid class status and  undervaluation, if not disdaining, of knowledge which are proving so  disastrous in England and other European countries will be avoided,  and the aristocracy of learning established in its place.    Besides educational institutions, we find institutions for poor relief,  hospitals, foundling hospitals, orphan asylums, banking, insurance,  and loan associations, travellers' clubs, mercantile corporations,  anti-opium societies, co-operative burial societies, as well as many  others, some imitated from Western models.      Bodily Mutilations    Compared with the practices found to exist among most primitive races,  the mutilations the Chinese were in the habit of inflicting were but  few. They flattened the skulls of their babies by means of stones, so  as to cause them to taper at the top, and we have already seen what  they did to their spines; also the mutilations in warfare, and the  punishments inflicted both within and without the law; and how filial  children and loyal wives mutilated themselves for the sake of their  parents and to prevent remarriage. Eunuchs, of course, existed in great  numbers. People bit, cut, or marked their arms to pledge oaths. But  the practices which are more peculiarly associated with the Chinese  are the compressing "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#5)"],[1,"flourishing there about the  time of the Christian era, since it spread thence to China not later  than the middle of the first century. There were two schools  representing two distinct currents from India. First the Sarvastivadin  school, prevalent in Badakshan, Kashgar and Kucha, secondly the Mahayana  in Khotan and Yarkand. The spread of the former was no doubt connected  with the growth of the Kushan Empire but may be anterior to the  conversion of Kanishka, for though he gave a great impetus to the  propagation of the faith, it is probable that, like most royal converts,  he favoured an already popular religion. The Mahayana subsequently won  much territory from the other school.    5. As in other countries, so in China Buddhism entered by more than one  road. It came first by land from Central Asia. The official date for its  introduction by this route is 62 A.D. but it was probably known within  the Chinese frontier before that time, though not recognized by the  state. Secondly when Buddhism was established, there arose a desire for  accurate knowledge of the true Indian doctrine. Chinese pilgrims went to  India and Indian teachers came to China. After the fourth century many  of these religious journeys were made by sea and it was thus that  Bodhidharma landed at Canton in 520[13]. A third stream of Buddhism,  namely Lamaism, came into China from Tibet under the Mongol dynasty  (1280). Khubilai considered this the best religion for his Mongols and  numerous Lamaist temples and convents were established and still exist  in northern China. Lamaism has not perhaps been a great religious or  intellectual force there, but its political importance was considerable,  for the Ming and Manchu dynasties who wished to assert their rule over  the Tibetans and Mongols by peaceful methods, consistently strove to win  the goodwill of the Lamaist clergy.    The Buddhism of Korea, Japan and Annam is directly derived from the  earlier forms of Chinese Buddhism but was not affected by the later  influx of Lamaism. Buddhism passed from China into Korea in the fourth  century and thence to Japan in the sixth. In the latter country it was  stimulated by frequent contact with China and the repeated introduction  of new Chinese sects but was not appreciably influenced by direct  intercourse with Hindus or other foreign Buddhists. In the twelfth and  thirteenth centuries Japanese Buddhism showed great vitality,  transforming old sects and creating new ones.    In the south, Chinese Buddhism spread into Annam rather late: according  to native tradition in the tenth century. This region was a battlefield  of two cultures. Chinese influence descending southwards from Canton  proved predominant and, after the triumph of Annam over Champa, extended  to the borders of Camboja. But so long as the kingdom of Champa existed,  Indian culture and Hinduism maintained themselves at least as far north  as Hue.    6. The Buddhism of Tibet is a late and startling transformation of  Gotama's teaching, but the transformation is due rather to the change  and degeneration of that teaching in Bengal than to the admixture of  Tibetan ideas. Such admixture however was not absent and a series of  reformers endeavoured to bring the church back to what they considered  the true standard. The first introduction is said to have occurred in  630 but probably the arrival of Padma Sambhava from India in 747 marks  the real foundation of the Lamaist church. It was reformed by the Hindu  Atisa in 1038 and again by the Tibetan Tsong-kha-pa about 1400.    The Grand Lama is the head of the church as reorganized by Tsong-kha-pa.  In Tibet the priesthood attained to temporal power comparable with the  Papacy. The disintegration of the government divided the whole land into  small principalities and among these the great monasteries were as  important as any temporal lord. The abbots of the Sakya monastery were  the practical rulers of Tibet for seventy years (1270-1340). Another  period of disintegration followed but after 1630 the Grand Lamas of  Lhasa were able to claim and maintain a similar position.    Mongolian Buddhism is a branch of Lamaism distinguished by no special  doctrines. The Mongols were partially converted in the time of Khubilai  and a second time and more thoroughly in 1570 by the third Grand Lama.    7. Nepal exhibits another phase of degeneration. In Tibet Indian  Buddhism passed into the hands of a vigorous national priesthood and was  not exposed to the assimilative influence of Hinduism. In Nepal it had  not the same defence. It probably existed there since the time of Asoka  and underwent the same phases of decay and corruption as in Bengal. But  whereas the last great monasteries in Bengal were shattered by the  Mohammedan invasion of 1193, the secluded valley of Nepal was protected  against such violence and Buddhism continued to exist there in name. It  has preserved a good deal of Sanskrit Buddhist literature but has become  little more than a sect of Hinduism.    Nepal ought perhaps to be classed in our second division, that is those  countries where Indian culture was introduced not by missionaries but by  the settlement of Indian conquerors or immigrants. To this class belong  the Hindu civilizations of Indo-China and the Archipelago. In all of  these Hinduism and Mahayanist Buddhism are found mixed together,  Hinduism being the stronger element. The earliest Sanskrit inscription  in these regions is that of Vochan in Champa which is apparently  Buddhist. It is not later than the third century and refers to an  earlier king, so that an Indian dynasty probably existed there about  150-200 A.D. Though the presence of Indian culture is beyond dispute, it  is not clear whether the Chams were civilized in Champa by Hindu  invaders or whether they were hinduized Malays who invaded Champa from  elsewhere.    8. In Camboja a Hindu dynasty was founded by invaders and the Brahmans  who accompanied them established a counterpart to it in a powerful  hierarchy, Sanskrit becoming the language of religion. It is clear that  these invaders came ultimately from India but they may have halted in  Java or the Malay Peninsula for an unknown period. The Brahmanic  hierarchy began to fail about the fourteenth century and was supplanted  by Siamese Buddhism. Before that time the state religion of both Champa  and Camboja was the worship of Siva, especially in the form called  Mukhalinga. Mahayanist Buddhism, tending to identify Buddha with Siva,  also existed but enjoyed less of the royal patronage.    9. Religious conditions were similar in Java but politically there was  this difference, that there was no one continuous and paramount kingdom.  A considerable number of Hindus must have settled in the island to  produce such an effect on its language and architecture but the rulers  of the states known to us were hinduized Javanese rather than true  Hindus and the language of literature and of most inscriptions was Old  Javanese, not Sanskrit, though most of the works written in it were  translations or adaptations of Sanskrit originals. As in Camboja,  Sivaism and Buddhism both flourished without mutual hostility and there  was less difference in the status of the two creeds.    In all these countries religion seems to have been connected with  politics more closely than in India. The chief shrine was a national  cathedral, the living king was semi-divine and dead kings were  represented by statues bearing the attributes of their favourite gods.      6. _New Forms of Buddhism_    In the three or four centuries following Asoka a surprising change came  over Indian Buddhism, but though the facts are clear it is hard to  connect them with dates and persons. But the change was clearly  posterior to Asoka for though his edicts show a spirit of wide charity  it is not crystallized in the form of certain doctrines which  subsequently became prominent.    The first of these holds up as the moral ideal not personal perfection  or individual salvation but the happiness of all living creatures. The  good man who strives for this should boldly aspire to become a Buddha in  some future birth and such aspirants are called Bodhisattvas. Secondly  Buddhas and some Bodhisattvas come to be considered as supernatural  beings and practically deities. The human life of Gotama, though not  denied, is regarded as the manifestation of a cosmic force which also  reveals itself in countless other Buddhas who are not merely his  predecessors or destined successors but the rulers of paradises in other  worlds. Faith in a Buddha, especially in Amitabha, can secure rebirth in  his paradise. The great Bodhisattvas, such as Avalokita and Manjusri,  are splendid angels of mercy and knowledge who are theoretically  distinguished from Buddhas because they have indefinitely postponed  their entry into nirvana in order to alleviate the sufferings of the  world. These new tenets are accompanied by a remarkable development of  art and of idealist metaphysics.    This new form of Buddhism is called Mahayana, or the Great Vehicle, as  opposed to the Small Vehicle or Hinayana, a somewhat contemptuous name  given to the older school. The idea underlying these phrases is that  sects are merely coaches, all travelling on the same road to salvation  though some may be quicker than others. The Mahayana did not suppress  the Hinayana but it gradually absorbed the traffic.    The causes of this transformation were two-fold, internal or Indian and  external. Buddhism was a living, that is changing, stream of thought and  the Hindus as a nation have an exceptional taste and capacity for  metaphysics. This taste was not destroyed by Gotama's dicta as to the  limits of profitable knowledge nor did new deities arouse hostility  because they were not mentioned in the ancient scriptures. The  development of Brahmanism and Buddhism was parallel: if an attractive  novelty appeared in one, something"]]]
