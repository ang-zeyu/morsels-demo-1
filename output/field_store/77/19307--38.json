Virginia rushed to her side, half frantic with terror.    \"Oh, mother, mother, what is it? What have I done! what have I done! I  know you're the best friend I have in the world!\" she cried, stooping over  her, loosening her bonnet-strings and dress, and trying vainly to lift her  to the lounge, for she was a large, heavy woman and now in a state of  utter insensibility, her face purple, her breathing stertorous.    The sound of her fall and Virginia's terrified shriek had brought the  neighbors flocking upon the scene; some of the boldest opening the door  and ushering themselves in without the ceremony of knocking.    \"The lady's in a fit!\" cried a woman, hurrying to Virginia's assistance;  \"you've druv her to distraction; you shouldn't a ben so abusive; I could  hear ye clear into my room a scoldin' and accusin' of her of makin' your  match fer ye.\"    \"Run for a doctor, some of you!\" cried Virginia, standing by the couch  where, with the woman's help, she had laid her mother, and wringing her  hands in helpless distress. \"Oh, she'll die! she'll die! Mother, mother!  I'm sorry I was so cruel! Oh, I take it all back. Oh, mother, speak to  me!\"    \"'Tain't no use,\" said the woman, \"she don't hear ye. An' if she did she  couldn't speak. I've seen folks struck down with apoplexy afore.\"    \"Oh, will she die? will she die?\" groaned the wretched daughter, dropping  on her knees beside the couch.    \"Can't tell, mum; sometimes they die in a little bit, and sometimes they  get purty well over it and live on for years. Here, let me put another  pillar under her head, and some o' ye there run and fetch the coldest  water that ever ye can git.\"    Some one had summoned a physician, and he presently came hurrying in. His  first act was to send every one from the room except the patient and her  two attendants.    With tears and sobs Virginia besought him to save her mother's life.    \"I shall certainly do my best, madam,\" he said, \"but very little can be  done at present. What was the immediate cause of the attack?\"    Virginia answered vaguely that her mother was fatigued with a long journey  and had been worried and fretted.    \"This is not her home?\" glancing around the meanly furnished dirty room.    \"No; neither she nor I have been accustomed to such surroundings,\"  answered Virginia haughtily. \"Can you not see that we are ladies? We are  from the South, and mother has but just arrived. Oh, tell me, is she going  to die?\"    \"Her recovery is doubtful. If she has other near relatives who care to see  her alive, I advise you to summon them with all speed.\"    \"Oh dear! oh dear! you must save her!\" cried Virginia frantically,  wringing her hands. \"I can't have her die. They'll say I killed her! But  every word I said was true; she did all in her power to make the match  that has ruined my happiness and all my prospects for life.\"    \"So you, her own daughter, have brought this on by cruel taunts and  reproaches!\" the physician said in a tone of mingled contempt and  indignation. \"I hope you feel that the least you can do now is to take the  best possible care of her.\"    \"How can I?\" sobbed Virginia. \"I've no money to pay a nurse or buy  comforts for mother, and I know nothing about nursing or cooking for sick  or well. I wasn't brought up to work.\"    A boy now came to the door with a message from the hackman; \"he couldn't  stay any longer if the lady wasn't going to the steamer, and he wanted  his pay.\"    Virginia opened a small satchel that had dropped from her mother's hand,  found her purse, paid the man his dues, and counting the remainder told  the doctor there was enough to provide what would be needed for the  patient until other relatives could be summoned, and that should be done  at once by telegrams to be paid by the recipients.    The doctor approved, and kindly offered to attend to sending the messages  for her.          CHAPTER IV.        \"O gloriously upon the deep        The gallant vessel rides,       And she is mistress of the winds,        And mistress of the tides.\"                   --_Miss Landon_.      Meanwhile Edward had taken his sister on board the steamer, and she,  greatly exhausted by grief, anxiety, and fatigue, had at once retired to  her berth.    Edward also was weary and in need of sleep, so presently went to his  state-room, leaving Ben to attend to the luggage and watch for Mrs.  Conly's arrival.    Faithful Ben waited patiently about for a couple of hours, then began to  grow uneasy lest Mrs. Conly should not arrive in season. Another hour  passed, and he reluctantly roused his young master to ask what could be  done.    \"What's wanted?\" Edward asked, waked by Ben's loud rap on the state-room  door.    \"Miss Louise she hasn't come yet, Marse Ed'ard,\" he said, \"and de  steamah'll be startin' fo' long. I don' know whar to go to look her up, so  please excuse me for rousin' ye, sah.\"    \"Hasn't come yet, do you say, Ben? and the vessel about to sail?\"  exclaimed Edward in dismay, springing from his berth to open the door.  \"Why, yes,\" looking at his watch, \"there's barely half an hour left, and I  don't see what we can do.\"    \"No time now fo' me to go an' hunt up Miss Louise, Marse Ed'ard? Ise berry  sorry, sah, dat I didn't come soonah to ax you 'bout it, but I didn't like  to 'sturb you,\" said Ben, looking much distressed.    \"Never mind, Ben,\" Edward answered kindly, \"you couldn't have gone for  her, because she gave me no address, and I have not the least idea where  to send for her.\"    \"Den what am to be done, sah?\"    \"We will have to sail without her. I could not think of asking my sister  to wait for the next steamer,\" Edward said, more as if thinking aloud than  talking to Ben.    The latter bowed respectfully and withdrew, but only to come hurrying back  the next moment with a telegram from Virginia.    \"Mother taken suddenly ill. Remains with me. Send luggage to No. ----  street.\"    This news of his aunt's illness caused Edward regret not wholly unmingled  with satisfaction in the thought of being spared her companionship on the  voyage and afterward.    He read the message aloud to Ben. \"You see it would have done no good if  we could have gone for her,\" he remarked. \"But go, make haste to have the  baggage sent ashore to the address given here.\"    Elsie's state-room adjoined her brother's. She too had been roused by  Ben's knock and overheard a part of what passed between him and his young  master. Dinah also was listening.    \"What dat dey say, Miss Elsie?\" she queried in a startled tone, \"Miss  Louise sick?\"    \"I think that was what Master Edward said; but go to his door, Dinah, and  ask.\"    Edward came himself with his answer and bringing a second telegram; this  time from their grandfather, saying the children were decidedly better,  all the rest of the family well.    \"Oh, what good news!\" exclaimed Elsie. \"But poor Aunt Louise! I wish we  knew her exact condition. Do you not think it must have been a sudden  seizure?\"    \"Yes, of either illness or desire to remain behind. Don't let it worry  you, sister dear. You have already quite enough of anxiety to endure.\"    \"No,\" she said, with a sweet, patient smile, \"I am trying not to be  anxious or troubled about anything, but to obey the sweet command,  'casting all your care upon Him.'\"    \"'For He careth for you,'\" added Edward, completing the quotation. \"It  is, as you say, a sweet command, most restful to those who obey it. Have  you slept?\"    \"Yes, I have had a long and very refreshing nap; still I have not  recovered from my fatigue, and shall not leave my state-room for some time  yet.\"    \"Let me send in your supper,\" he said. \"I hope it will refresh you still  more, and that after it you may feel equal to a turn on deck with me. It  will be moonlight, and if you wrap up well you will not find the air more  than bracingly keen.\"    \"Thank you,\" she said. \"It is altogether likely I shall find the exercise  of a short promenade rather restful than otherwise, after being so long  cramped up in the cars. You are a dear, good brother to me, Ned,\" she  added, laying her hand affectionately on his arm as he sat on the edge of  the berth close by her side. \"But how strange it seems that we two are  starting off on this long voyage alone!\"    \"I'm so proud to be trusted to take care of you, Elsie,\" he returned,  bending over her and tenderly smoothing her luxuriant hair. \"I used to  look up to you years ago, but now----\"    \"You look down on me?\" she interrupted sportively. \"No great feat, Master  Ned, while I lie here.\"    \"Nor when we stand side by side,\" he returned in the same tone, 'seeing I  have grown to be a full head taller than you. But truth compels me to  acknowledge that I am your superior in nothing else except physical  strength.\"    \"You might add knowledge of the world, you have had to rely on your own  judgment so much oftener than I who have so seldom left mamma's side.  Dear, dear mamma! Oh, Ned, how long will it be before I see her again?\"    She wept as she spoke, and Edward felt for the moment strongly inclined to  join her. But instead he tried to cheer her.    \"We will hope Cousin Arthur may prescribe a sea voyage for grandpa and the  children before long, and then we shall have the whole family joining us  in Italy.\"    \"How delightful that would be, Ned!\" she said, smiling through her tears.    \"And do you know,\" he went on gayly, \"it is strongly impressed upon me  that we shall find Lester convalescent, and by good nursing and our  cheering companionship so help it on that we shall have him a well man in  a few weeks.\"    \"Ah, if it might be so!\" she sighed. \"'But He doeth all things well,' and  oh how precious are His promises!

He remembered all the dogs at the Hospice had talked  about the place where there was never any snow.    \"How can a dog save lives where there is no snow?\" he asked; but the  women and children, as they turned away, thought he was whining because  they were leaving him alone.    With miserable eyes Jan lay staring into the dark, wondering how he  could be like his father and Barry in a country where there was no snow.          Chapter IV    THE LAND OF NO SNOW      The voyage ended, then followed another long trip in a train and Jan  reached his new home. A little girl with long, yellow curls, big blue  eyes, and pink cheeks, danced down the steps from the wide porch of a  big house as they approached.    Mr. Pixley caught her in his arms, then put her on the ground and called  to Jan, who was still in the automobile which had met them at the  station. The dog leaped out and ran to the child, looking into her face,  while his tail bobbed and waved.    \"Oh, you beautiful Prince Jan!\" she cried, throwing her arms about his  neck and squeezing him tightly. \"I love you!\"    Jan's tongue caressed her hands, touched her cheek, and his body  squirmed and twisted, then he flopped on the ground and rolled on his  back, waving his paws to show that he loved her. Obeying her call, he  trotted be sidle her, past strange trees growing on stretches of fresh,  green grass. Jan looked about him and saw that this new stuff that was  so soft when he walked upon it, reached down to the blue water, and that  water sparkled as far as he could see, and then it seemed to become a  part of the sky. Wonderful things that gave out delicate perfume formed  brilliant patches about the house and even clung high up on the walls.  Later, he learned these things were flowers, and when the wind blew  softly, they bent and swayed like lovely ladies in their prettiest  gowns, bowing and dancing. From the thick leaves of the trees floated  songs of hidden birds. Jan's head turned quickly from side to side,  trying to see everything and understand what he saw, but the most  wonderful thing to him was the dear little mistress, who talked to him  as if she knew he understood her words.    All the people in the big house were very kind to Jan, and he soon grew  accustomed to his new home. His only duty was to take care of Elizabeth,  who was so gentle and loving that he was glad and proud to guard her.  Wherever she went, he went, too.    The governess heard Elizabeth's lessons out on the lawn under the shade  of an orange tree, and Jan kept close at hand, watching the little  girl's face, and waiting patiently for the lesson to end. Then a pony  was led to the front door, and as Elizabeth rode over the firm sand of  the beach, Jan raced beside her, barking or rushing out to fight back a  wave that was sneaking too close. He loved the water, and the best time  of all, he thought, was when his mistress took her swimming lesson and  he could plough through the waves beside her. Often she would lie on her  back in the hissing, white surf, holding to Jan's collar until they both  landed on the warm sand. Sometimes the two of them would dig a big hole,  and the dog would scrunch into it, while she buried him until only his  nose and eyes could be seen. Jan was so happy that at times he forgot  the Hospice and the work his mother had told him he must do. When he did  remember it, he would puzzle over and over, \"But, how can I save  people's lives here, where there is never any snow, and every one is  happy and safe?\"    Christmas came, and there was a glittering tree with lights and  beautiful things on it. All the family patted Jan when Elizabeth took  down a handsome collar.    \"This is for you, Jan,\" she said.    As she fastened it about his neck, he thought of the big room at the  Hospice, but he knew, now, no collar of his would ever hang there.  Suddenly, all the old longing for the Hospice dogs and the work made him  walk slowly out of the house and lie down on the front porch, where he  could see the blue ocean dancing in the warm sunshine, the soft, green  grass, and the beautiful flowers.    \"Oh, if I could only go back home to the snow and do my work there!\" he  wished, and then, in a little while he fell sound asleep.    The Fairy of Happy Dreams was very busy that Christmas Day, and when she  flew over Prince Jan and saw he was so lonesome and homesick, she  touched him with her magic wand and fluttered away, smiling.    And Prince Jan dreamed he was at the door of the Hospice. The little  wooden keg hung from his collar. Rollo, with another collar and keg,  romped beside him, pulling playfully at Jan's hairy neck, while Brother  Antoine and other monks stood on the upper step, smiling and saying,  \"He is just like his father, and Rex was descended from Barry! Prince  Jan is of royal blood. He will be a credit to his ancestors!\"    In the dream, Jan bounded away through the crisp, biting air, his big  paws sinking in the cold, fluffy snow. Oh, how good it felt!    \"My time has come! My time has come!\" he shouted as he leaped with joy.    \"Jan! Jan! Remember your father!\" his mother and Bruno called after him.    \"I will,\" he answered. Then he and Rollo raced down the slippery path,  their voices, like deep-sounding bells, giving forth the cry of the St.  Bernards. They trod over ice-bridges, ploughed through deep drifts,  sliding and floundering, following the trail of their forefathers, and  sniffing as they ran.    Suddenly Jan stopped and thrust his nose into a deep drift. Then he and  Rollo dug furiously, until Jan cried, \"Run, Rollo, run to the Hospice!\"    Rollo whirled and disappeared, while Jan's rough tongue licked the snow  until he saw the round, soft face of a child, and beneath that child lay  its mother. Both were very quiet. Jan licked their faces, he pushed  them with his nose to rouse them, then he crowded his warm body closely  against them, and his eyes watched the trail. Soon he gave a wild yelp,  for he saw Rollo coming and back of him hurried Brother Antoine and one  of the men of the Hospice who helped on the trail.    The men lifted the woman and child, and wrapped them in warm shawls,  then they unfastened the keg from Jan's collar, and as the woman opened  her eyes they made her drink the liquid. Some of it was given to the  child. Brother Antoine carried the little one in his arms while the  other man held the woman, and Jan and Rollo trotted ahead of them to  beat down the snow and make the path easier to travel. Bruno and the  other dogs in the kennel yard sent back answering calls to Jan and  Rollo. The door opened and kindly hands received the woman and child,  and carried them to shelter and warmth.    Brother Antoine stooped and patted Jan's head, and brushed off snow that  still clung to the long hair on the dog's back, saying very softly, \"The  Blessed Mother guided you, Jan; for you have saved a mother and child  on Christmas Day!\"    Then he heard laughter and voices saying, \"Jan is dreaming again! Wake  up, Jan!\"    He woke to see waving palms, green grass, flowers, and the warm sunshine  of a land where there is never any snow. His heart, which had been  throbbing madly with joy, grew sad. He looked at his little mistress and  her friends smiling at him so kindly, and wished he could tell them his  dream and beg them to send him back where he could be useful and do the  work of his father and Barry.    But the talk of dogs is different from ours; even people who speak the  same language often misunderstand one another. Once in a great while  some person is wise enough and good enough to understand what dogs try  to say, but Prince Jan's little mistress, though she loved him dearly,  never knew what was in his heart.    The months slipped away until Jan was fully grown. His tawny-red and  white hair was as soft as silk, and when he put his paws on a man's  shoulders, their eyes were the same height. In spite of his strength and  size, he was gentle and kind. Every one loved him and he loved  everybody.    The only sadness in his life was in knowing that he could not help  people in a place where there was no snow. One night, as he came on the  porch, Jan thought it was snowing, and he raced to the spot where he had  seen the flakes falling in the bright moonlight; but when he pushed his  nose into the white glistening things beneath a tree, he found they were  only petals from the orange blossoms, the perfumed snowflakes of  California, and Jan lay down among them, the old longing for his home  and his work tugging at his heart.          Chapter V    JAN LEARNS TO HATE      Four happy years passed by. Elizabeth had grown into a beautiful young  lady, but she loved Jan as much as ever, and he was always at her side.    Then one morning when Jan, as usual, went to the front porch to tell Mr.  Pixley that breakfast was ready, there was no one sitting in the rocker  where Jan expected to find his master reading the paper, and no kindly  voice called, \"All right, Jan! Tell them I'm coming!\"    Slowly the dog went back to the big dining-room. But Elizabeth and her  mother were not in their accustomed places, either. Puzzled, he trotted  through the hallway and up the wide stairs, following the sound of  murmuring voices in Mr. Pixley's room. Through the half-open door Jan  saw two strange men talking to Elizabeth and her mother. On the bed,  very white and quiet, Mr. Pixley was lying.    \"The only chance is an operation by Dr. Corey of London,\" one of the  men spoke to Mrs. Pixley, and the other man nodded.    \"We can cable to London and have him sail immediately for New York,  while we are on our way from here,\" added the second man to Elizabeth,"]]]
