[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#5)"],[1," rudeness for anyone to go to an entertainment  given in honor of some one and fail to \"meet\" him. (Even though one's  memory is too feeble to remember him afterward!)      =INTRODUCTIONS AT A DINNER=    The host must always see that every gentleman either knows or is presented  to the lady he is to \"take in\" to dinner, and also, if possible, to the  one who is to sit at the other side of him. If the latter introduction is  overlooked, people sitting next each other at table nearly always  introduce themselves. A gentleman says, \"How do you do, Mrs. Jones. I am  Arthur Robinson.\" Or showing her his place card, \"I have to introduce  myself, this is my name.\" Or the lady says first, \"I am Mrs. Hunter  Jones.\" And the man answers, \"How do you do, Mrs. Jones, my name is  Titherington Smith.\"    It is not unusual, in New York, for those placed next each other to talk  without introducing themselves--particularly if each can read the name of  the other on the place cards.      =OTHER NECESSARY INTRODUCTIONS=    Even in New York's most introductionless circles, people always introduce:    A small group of people who are to sit together anywhere.    Partners at dinner.    The guests at a house party.    Everyone at a small dinner or luncheon.    The four who are at the same bridge table.    Partners or fellow-players in any game.    At a dance, when an invitation has been asked for a stranger, the friend  who vouched for him should personally present him to the hostess. \"Mrs.  Worldly, this is Mr. Robinson, whom you said I might bring.\" The hostess  shakes hands and smiles and says: \"I am very glad to see you, Mr.  Robinson.\"    A guest in a box at the opera always introduces any gentleman who comes to  speak to her, to her hostess, unless the latter is engrossed in  conversation with a visitor of her own, or unless other people block the  distance between so that an introduction would be forced and awkward.    A newly arriving visitor in a lady's drawing-room is not introduced to  another who is taking leave. Nor is an animated conversation between two  persons interrupted to introduce a third. Nor is any one ever led around a  room and introduced right and left.    If two ladies or young girls are walking together and they meet a third  who stops to speak to one of them, the other walks slowly on and does not  stand awkwardly by and wait for an introduction. If the third is asked by  the one she knows, to join them, the sauntering friend is overtaken and an  introduction always made. The third, however, must not join them unless  invited to do so.    At a very large dinner, people (excepting the gentlemen and ladies who are  to sit next to each other at table) are not collectively introduced. After  dinner, men in the smoking room or left at table always talk to their  neighbors whether they have been introduced or not, and ladies in the  drawing-room do the same. But unless they meet soon again, or have found  each other so agreeable that they make an effort to continue the  acquaintance, they become strangers again, equally whether they were  introduced or not.    Some writers on etiquette speak of \"correct introductions\" that carry  \"obligations of future acquaintance,\" and \"incorrect introductions,\" that  seemingly obligate one to nothing.    Degrees of introduction are utterly unknown to best society. It makes not  the slightest difference so far as any one's acceptance or rejection of  another is concerned how an introduction is worded or, on occasions,  whether an introduction takes place at all.    Fashionable people in very large cities take introductions lightly; they  are veritable ships that pass in the night. They show their red or green  signals--which are merely polite sentences and pleasant manners--and they  pass on again.    When you are introduced to some one for the second time and the first  occasion was without interest and long ago, there is no reason why you  should speak of the former meeting.    If some one presents you to Mrs. Smith for the second time on the same  occasion, you smile and say \"I have already met Mrs. Smith,\" but you say  nothing if you met Mrs. Smith long ago and she showed no interest in you  at that time.    Most rules are elastic and contract and expand according to circumstances.  You do not remind Mrs. Smith of having met her before, but on meeting  again any one who was brought to your own house, or one who showed you an  especial courtesy you instinctively say, \"I am so glad to see you again.\"      =INCLUDING SOMEONE IN CONVERSATION WITHOUT AN INTRODUCTION=    On occasions it happens that in talking to one person you want to include  another in your conversation without making an introduction. For instance:  suppose you are talking to a seedsman and a friend joins you in your  garden. You greet your friend, and then include her by saying, \"Mr. Smith  is suggesting that I dig up these cannas and put in delphiniums.\" Whether  your friend gives an opinion as to the change in color of your flower bed  or not, she has been made part of your conversation.    This same maneuver of evading an introduction is also resorted to when you  are not sure that an acquaintance will be agreeable to one or both of  those whom an accidental circumstance has brought together.      =INTRODUCTIONS UNNECESSARY=    You must never introduce people to each other in public places unless you  are certain beyond a doubt that the introduction will be agreeable to  both. You cannot commit a greater social blunder than to introduce, to a  person of position, some one she does not care to know, especially on  shipboard, in hotels, or in other very small, rather public, communities  where people are so closely thrown together that it is correspondingly  difficult to avoid undesirable acquaintances who have been given the wedge  of an introduction.    As said above, introductions in very large cities are unimportant. In New  York, where people are meeting new faces daily, seldom seeing the same one  twice in a year, it requires a tenacious memory to recognize those one  hoped most to see again, and others are blotted out at once.    People in good society rarely ask to be introduced to each other, but if  there is a good reason for knowing some one, they often introduce  themselves; for instance, Mary Smith says:    \"Mrs. Jones, aren't you a friend of my mother's? I am Mrs. Titherington  Smith's daughter.\" Mrs. Jones says:    \"Why, my dear child, I am so glad you spoke to me. Your mother and I have  known each other since we were children!\"    Or, an elder lady asks: \"Aren't you Mary Smith? I have known your mother  since she was your age.\" Or a young woman says: \"Aren't you Mrs. Worldly?\"  Mrs. Worldly, looking rather freezingly, politely says \"Yes\" and waits.  And the stranger continues, \"I think my sister Millicent Manners is a  friend of yours.\" Mrs. Worldly at once unbends. \"Oh, yes, indeed, I am  devoted to Millicent! And you must be ----?\"    \"I'm Alice.\"    \"Oh, of course, Millicent has often talked of you, and of your lovely  voice. I want very much to hear you sing some time.\"    These self-introductions, however, must never presumingly be made. It  would be in very bad taste for Alice to introduce herself to Mrs. Worldly  if her sister knew her only slightly.      =A BUSINESS VISIT NOT AN INTRODUCTION=    A lady who goes to see another to get a reference for a servant, or to ask  her aid in an organization for charity, would never consider such a  meeting as an introduction, even though they talked for an hour. Nor would  she offer to shake hands in leaving. On the other hand, neighbors who are  continually meeting, gradually become accustomed to say \"How do you do?\"  when they meet, even though they never become acquaintances.      =THE RETORT COURTEOUS TO ONE YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN=    Let us suppose some one addresses you, and then slightly disconcerted  says: \"You don't remember me, do you?\" The polite thing--unless his manner  does not ring true, is to say \"Why, of course, I do.\" And then if a few  neutral remarks lead to no enlightening topic, and bring no further  memory, you ask at the first opportunity who it was that addressed you. If  the person should prove actually to be unknown, it is very easy to repel  any further advances. But nearly always you find it is some one you ought  to have known, and your hiding the fact of your forgetfulness saves you  from the rather rude and stupid situation of blankly declaring: \"I don't  remember you.\"    If, after being introduced to you, Mr. Jones calls you by a wrong name,  you let it pass, at first, but if he persists you may say: \"My name is  Simpson, not Simpkin.\"    At a private dance, young men nowadays introduce their men friends to  young women without first asking the latter's permission, because all  those invited to a lady's house are supposed to be eligible for  presentation to everyone, or they would not be there.    At a public ball young men and women keep very much to their own  particular small circle and are not apt to meet outsiders at all. Under  these circumstances a gentleman should be very careful not to introduce a  youth whom he knows nothing about to a lady of his acquaintance--or at  least he should ask her first. He can say frankly: \"There is a man called  Sliders who has asked to meet you. I don't know who he is, but he seems  decent. Shall I introduce him?\" The lady can say \"Yes\"; or, \"I'd rather  not.\"      =INTRODUCTION BY LETTER=    An introduction by letter is far more binding than a casual spoken  introduction which commits you to nothing. This is explained fully and  example letters are given in the chapter on Letters.    A letter of introduction is handed you unsealed, always. It is correct for  you to seal it at once in the presence of its author. You thank your  friend for having written it and go on your journey.    If you are a man and your introduction is to a lady, you go to her house  as soon as you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14317"],[0,"The Sorcery Club (#5)"],[1," way to seek an  opportunity to avenge any personal injury; and if his mind is  earnestly and wholly concentrated on acquiring knowledge of the Black  Art no bodily mishap will befall him. During this time of probation he  must will himself to dream, at night, of all the deeds he had it in  his mind to do, during the day; when he will know, by his visions, to  what extent he is progressing. At the end of the week he must apply  the tests to see if he is in a ripe state to proceed.        \"The tests--        \"No. 1. At midnight, when the moon is full, place a mirror, set in      a wooden frame, in a tub of water, so that it will float on the      surface with its face uppermost. Put in the water fifteen grains      of bicarbonate of potash, and sprinkle it with three drops of      blood, not necessarily human If the reflection of the moon in the      mirror then appear crimson, the test is satisfactorily      accomplished.        \"No. 2. At midnight, when the moon is full, take a black cat, place      it where the moonbeams are thickest, sprinkle it with three drops      of blood, not necessarily human, and rub its coat with the palm of      the hand. Sparks will then be given out, and if those sparks      appear crimson the test is satisfactorily done.        \"No. 3. Take a human skull--preferably that of some person who has      met with an unnatural end, pour on it a single drop of fresh,      human blood--place it on a couch, and go to sleep with the back      part of the head resting on it. If you are awakened, at the second      hour after midnight, by hearing a great commotion close at hand,      and the room is then discovered to be full of crimson light, the      test is satisfactorily fulfilled.        \"No. 4. Take half a score of the berries of enchanter's      nightshade,[15] two ounces of hemlock leaves in powder, and one      ounce of red sorrel leaves. Heat them in an oven for two hours,      pound them together, in a mortar, and at midnight boil them in      water. As soon as the contents begin to bubble, remove them from      the fire and stand them in a dark place; and if the experiment is      to prove satisfactory, three bubbles of luminous green light will      rise simultaneously from the water and burst.        \"No. 5. In the above preparation after the test described, soak a      hazel twig, fashioned in the shape of a fork. On meeting a child      hold the fork with the V downwards in front of its face, and if      the child exhibits violence and signs of terror, and falls down,      the experiment is successful.        \"No. 6. Take a couple of handfuls of fine soil from over the spot      where some four-footed animal has recently been buried. Put it in      a tin vessel, mix with it three ounces of assafoetida and one      drachm of quassia chips, to which add a death's-head moth      (_Acherontia atropos_). Heat the vessel over a wood fire for three      hours. Then remove it and place it on the hearth, rake out the      fire and make the room absolutely dark. Keep watch beside the      vessel, and if, at the second hour after midnight, any strange      phenomena occur, the test will be known to have been      satisfactorily executed.        \"(_Addendum_) If any of these tests fail the candidate must wait      for six months before giving them a further trial, and he must      occupy the interim by training his thoughts in the manner already      prescribed. But if, on the other hand, the tests have been      successfully performed, he can proceed with the rites appertaining      to the Black Art.\"    Hamar had read so far when, with a gesture of impatience, he closed  the book. \"What a fool I am!\" he exclaimed, \"to waste my time with  such stuff!... But Maitland writes in such a devilish convincing way!  Jerusalem! Any straw is good enough for the drowning man, and if  witchcraft and sorcery with motors dashing by every second and the  whole air alive with wireless and telephones, is a bit beyond my  comprehension, what then? All I care about is money--and I'll leave no  stone unturned to get it. If it were possible for man to get in touch  with Daramara--the Unknown--Devil, or whatever else it chooses to call  itself--I'll call it an angel if it only gives me money--twenty  thousand years ago--why shouldn't it be possible to get in touch with  it now? Anyhow as I said before, I'll have a try. As far as the  preliminary stage is concerned, I fancy I'm pretty well fixed. My mind  is occupied right enough with things of this world--I don't give a  cent for anything belonging to another--and if only I had half a dozen  souls, I'd sell them right away now, for less than twenty thousand  dollars--a damned sight less. As for these tests--foolish isn't the  word for them--but it won't cost much just to try them.... Now,  according to Thomas Maitland, the ceremony of calling up the Unknown  stands a far greater chance of success if there are three human beings  present ... but, of course, if there is any truth in this business,  I'd rather keep the secret of it to myself. However, if I try alone,  the Unknown may not come to me, and then I shall have had all the  trouble of going through the tests for nothing!... Ah! now I see! If  the other two get more of the profits than I think necessary--I can  make use of my newly acquired Occult Power to--to dissolve  partnership! Ha! ha! I could--I could trick the Unknown if it comes to  that. Trust a Jew to outwit the Devil! I'll just look up Kelson  and--Curtis.\"        FOOTNOTES:      [Footnote 1: The river referred to by Maitland is the river    Lagartos, which was then (1691) unnamed.]      [Footnote 2: For chiche compare the ancient Maya or Yucatan word    Chicken-Itza (_i.e._ name of town in Yucatan where excavations are    now taking place--1912).]      [Footnote 3: For Menes compare Mayan Menes, wise men.]      [Footnote 4: Compare Mayan Chaac-mol, a leopard.]      [Footnote 5: Compare Ozil, Mayan for well-beloved.]      [Footnote 6: Moo, Mayan for Macaw.]      [Footnote 7: Nike, woman's name in Mayan.]      [Footnote 8: Recent (1912) discoveries of statues in Easter Island    still further corroborate the sinking of Atlantis.

Kelson and Curtis did not live in Pacific Avenue where the  Popes hold sway, nor yet in California Street where the Crockers are  wont to entertain their millionaire friends. Where they lived, there  were no massive granite steps flanked with equally massive  pillars--such as herald the approach to the Nob Hill palaces; no rare  glass bow-windows looking out on to flower bedecked lawns; no vast  betiled hall, with rotundas in the centre; no highly polished oak  staircases; no frescoed ceilings; no tufted, cerulean blue silk  draperies; and no sweet perfumery--only the smell, if one may so  suddenly sink to a third-class expression--only the smell of rank  tobacco and equally rank lager beer. No, Messrs. Kelson and Curtis  resided within a stone's throw of the five cent baths in Rutter  Street--and that was the nearest they ever got to bathing. Their suite  of apartments consisted of one room, about ten by eight feet, which  served as a dining-room, drawing-room, study, boudoir, kitchen,  bedroom, and--from sheer force of habit, I was about to add bathroom;  but as I have already hinted cold water on half-empty stomachs and  chilly livers is uninviting; besides, soap costs something. Their  furniture was antique but not massive; nor could any of it be fairly  reckoned superfluous. All told, it consisted of a bedstead (three  six-foot planks on four sugar cubes; the bedclothes--a pair of  discarded overalls, a torn and much emaciated blanket, a woolly neck  wrap, a yellow vest, and the garments they stood in); a small round  and rather rickety deal table; and one chair. Of the very limited  number of culinary utensils, the frying-pan was by far the most  important. Its handle served as a poker, and its pan, as well as for  frying, roasting and boiling, did duty for a teapot and a slop-basin.  They had no crockery. They had only one thing in abundance--namely,  air; for the lower frame of the window having long lacked glass in it,  a couple of pages of the _Examiner_, fixed in it, flapped dismally  every time the wind came blowing down 216th Street.    They had not lived there always. In the palmy days of work, before the  firm smashed, they had aspired to what might properly be called  diggings; and, moreover, had \"digged\" in respectable surroundings. It  was the usual thing--the thing that is happening always, every hour of  the day, in all the great cities of the "]]]
