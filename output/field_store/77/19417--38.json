The tyranny of sacerdotalism.]  While speculation was thus busy Sacerdotalism was also continually  extending its influence. The Brahman, the man of prayer, had made  himself indispensable in all sacred rites. He alone--as we have  seen--knew the holy text; he alone could rightly pronounce the words of  awful mystery and power on which depended all weal or woe. On all  religions occasions the priest must be called in, and, on all occasions,  implicitly obeyed. For a considerable time the princes straggled against  the encroachments of the priests; but in the end they were completely  vanquished. Never was sacerdotal tyranny more absolute; the proudest  pope in mediaeval times never lorded it over Western Christendom with  such unrelenting rigor as the Brahmans exercised over both princes and  people. The feeling of the priests is expressed in a well-known stanza:         \"All the world is subject to the gods; the gods are subject to the       holy texts; the holy texts are subject to the Brahman; therefore       the Brahman is my god.\"    Yes, the sacred man could breathe the spell which made earth and hell  and heaven itself to tremble. He therefore logically called himself an  earthly god. Indeed, the Brahman is always logical. He draws conclusions  from premises with iron rigor of reasoning; and with side-issues he has  nothing to do. He stands upon his rights. Woe to the being--god or  man--who comes in conflict with him!    [Sidenote: Ritual becomes extravagant.]  The priests naturally multiplied religious ceremonies, and made ritual  the soul of worship. Sacrifice especially assumed still more and more  exaggerated forms--becoming more protracted, more expensive, more  bloody. A hecatomb of victims was but a small offering. More and more  awful powers were ascribed to the rite.    [Sidenote: Reaction.]  But the tension was too great, and the bow snapped. Buddhism arose. We  may call this remarkable system the product of the age--an inevitable  rebellion against intolerable sacerdotalism; and yet we must not  overlook the importance of the very distinct and lofty personality of  Buddha (Sakya Muni) as a power molding it into shape.    [Sidenote: Buddhism.  Moral elements of this system.  Conflict with Brahmanism.  Victory of Brahmanism.]  Wherever it extended it effected a vast revolution in Indian thought.  Thus in regard to the institution of caste, Buddha did not attack it; he  did not, it would appear, even formally renounce it; as a mere social  institution he seems to have acknowledged it; but then he held that all  the _religious_ were freed from its restrictions. \"My law,\" said he, \"is  a law of mercy for all;\" and forthwith he proceeded to admit men of  every caste into the closest fellowship with himself and his followers.  Then, he preached--he, though not a Brahman--in the vernacular  languages--an immense innovation, which made his teachings popular. He  put in the forefront of his system certain great fundamental principles  of morality. He made religion consist in duty, not rites. He reduced  duty mainly to mercy or kindness toward all living beings--a marvelous  generalization. This set aside all slaughter of animals. The mind of the  princes and people was weary of priestcraft and ritualism; and the  teaching of the great reformer was most timely. Accordingly his doctrine  spread with great rapidity, and for a long time it seemed likely to  prevail over Brahmanism. But various causes gradually combined against  it. Partly, it was overwhelmed by its own luxuriance of growth; partly,  Brahmanism, which had all along maintained an intellectual superiority,  adopted, either from conviction or policy, most of the principles of  Buddhism, and skillfully supplied some of its main deficiencies. Thus  the Brahmans retained their position; and, at least nominally, their  religion won the day.          III.    RECONSTRUCTION--MODERN HINDUISM.      [Sidenote: Revival, in an altered form, of Hinduism.  Only the position of the Brahman and the restrictions of  caste retained.]  But the Hinduism that grew up, as Buddhism faded from Indian soil, was  widely different from the system with which early Buddhism had  contended. Hinduism, as it has been developed during the last thousand  or twelve hundred years, resembles a stupendous far-extended building,  or series of buildings, which is still receiving additions, while  portions have crumbled and are crumbling into ruin. Every conceivable  style of architecture, from that of the stately palace to the meanest  hut, is comprehended in it. On a portion of the structure here or there  the eye may rest with pleasure; but as a whole it is an unsightly,  almost monstrous, pile. Or, dismissing figures, we must describe it as  the most extraordinary creation which the world has seen. A jumble of  all things; polytheistic pantheism; much of Buddhism; something  apparently of Christianity, but terribly disfigured; a science wholly  outrageous; shreds of history twisted into wild mythology; the bold  poetry of the older books understood as literal prose; any local deity,  any demon of the aborigines, however hideous, identified with some  accredited Hindu divinity; any custom, however repugnant to common sense  or common decency, accepted and explained--in a word, later Hinduism has  been omnivorous; it has partially absorbed and assimilated every system  of belief, every form of worship, with which it has come in contact.  Only to one or two things has it remained inflexibly true. It has  steadily upheld the proudest pretensions of the Brahman; and it has  never relaxed the sternest restrictions of caste. We cannot wonder at  the severe judgment pronounced on Hinduism by nearly every Western  author. According to Macaulay, \"all is hideous and grotesque and  ignoble;\" and the calmer De Tocqueville maintains that \"Hinduism is  perhaps the only system of belief that is worse than having no religion  at all.\"[22]    When a modern Hindu is asked what are the sacred books of his religion  he generally answers: \"The Vedas, the Sastras (that is, philosophical  systems), and the Puranas.\" Some authorities add the Tantras.    The modern form of Hinduism is exhibited chiefly in the eighteen  Puranas, and an equal number of Upapuranas (minor Puranas).[23]    [Sidenote: The Puranas.]  When we compare the religion embodied in the Puranas with that of Vedic  times we are startled at the magnitude of the change. The Pantheon is  largely new; old deities have been superseded; other deities have taken  their place. There has been both accretion from without and evolution  from within. The thirty-three gods of the Vedas have been fantastically  raised to three hundred and thirty millions. Siva, Durga, Rama, Krishna,  Kali--unknown in ancient days--are now mighty divinities; Indra is  almost entirely overlooked, and Varuna has been degraded from his lofty  throne and turned into a regent of the waters.    [Sidenote: New deities, rites, and customs.]  The worship of the Linga (phallus) has been introduced. So has the great  dogma of Transmigration, which has stamped a deeper impress on later  Hindu mind than almost any other doctrine. Caste is fully established,  though in Vedic days scarcely, if at all, recognized. The dreadful  practice of widow-burning has been brought in, and this by a most  daring perversion of the Vedic texts. Woman, in fact, has fallen far  below the position assigned her in early days.    [Sidenote: The Trimurtti, a triad of gods.]  One of the notable things in connection with the reconstruction of  Hinduism is the position it gives to the Trimurtti, or triad of  gods--Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. Something like an anticipation of this  has been presented in the later Vedic times: fire, air, and the sun  (Agni, Vayu, and Surya) being regarded by the commentator[24] as summing  up the divine energies. But in the Vedas the deities often go in pairs;  and little stress should be laid on the idea of a Vedic triad. That  idea, however, came prominently forward in later days. The worship both  of Vishnu and Siva may have existed, from ancient times, as popular  rites not acknowledged by the Brahmans; but both of these deities were  now fully recognized. The god Brahma was an invention of the Brahmans;  he was no real divinity of the people, and had hardly ever been actually  worshiped. It is visual to designate Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva as  Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer respectively; but the generalization  is by no means well maintained in the Hindu books.    [Sidenote: The Avatara.]  The Puranas are in general violently sectarian; some being Vishnuite,  others Sivite. It is in connection with Vishnu, especially, that the  idea of incarnation becomes prominent. The Hindu term is _Avatara_,  literally, _descent_; the deity is represented as descending from heaven  to earth, for vindication of the truth and righteousness, or, to use the  words ascribed to Krishna,         For the preservation of the good, and the destruction of the wicked,       For the establishment of religion, I am born from age to age.    [Sidenote: The \"descents\" of Vishnu.]  The \"descents\" of Vishnu are usually reckoned ten. Of these by far the  most celebrated are those of Rama and Krishna. The great importance  attached to these two deities has been traced to the influence of  Buddhism. That system had exerted immense power in consequence of the  gentle and attractive character ascribed to Buddha. The older gods were  dim, distant, and often stern; some near, intelligible, and loving  divinity was longed for. Buddha was a brother-man, and yet a  quasi-deity; and hearts longing for sympathy and succor were strongly  attracted by such a personality.    [Sidenote: The god Rama.]  The character of Rama--or Ramachandra--is possessed of some high  qualities. The great poem in which it is described at fullest  length--the Ramayana of Valmiki--seems to have been an alteration, made  in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16997"],[0,"A Journey through the Kingdom of Oude, Volumes I & II (#5)"],[1," as there  is a treasury under his management.    If Government wish to take Major Stevens from the Byza Bae, and give  him some other employment, he might be sent to act for Captain Ross;  but I know nothing of his fitness for such an office.    I believe you know Captain Ross, and I need say nothing more than  what I have said in my public letter. If he be sent to Gwalior, I  hope a good officer may be sent to act for him in Thalone, for the  duties are very heavy and responsible. Blake will do very well, and  so would his second in command, Captain Erskine, of the 73rd, who is  an excellent civil officer. I must pray you to let me have the orders  of Government on the subject as soon as possible.                     Yours sincerely,                (Signed)     W. H. SLEEMAN.      P.S.--I should consider Major Stevens an able man for a civil charge,  but have never seen him.                  (Signed)     W. H. S.    To H. M. Elliot, Esq.,       &c. &c.                       __________________________                                                Jhansee, 6th May, 1848.    My Dear Maddock,    Your kind letter of the 21st ultimo had prepared me for the public  one of the 28th, which I got yesterday from Elliot, and I wrote off  at once, to say simply that I should be glad to suspend or to  withdraw the application contained in my letter of the 29th of March,  as might appear best to Government; and that I should not have made  it at all, had I apprehended that a compliance with it would have  been attended with any inconvenience.    With the knowledge I have acquired of the duties of the several  officers, and the entire command of my time here at a quiet place,  and long-established methodical habits, I can get through the work  very well, though it becomes trying sometimes. Arrears I never allow  to accumulate, and regular hours, and exercise, and sparing diet,  with water beverage, keep me always in condition for office work. I  often wish that you could have half the command of your hours, mode  of living, and movements, that I have. However, they will soon be  much more free than mine. I am very glad that you have the one year  more for a wind up; and hope that good fortune will attend you to the  last. You say nothing, however, about your foot. The papers and  letters from home have just come in. I hear that Lord John is very  unwell, and will not be able to stand the work many months more, and  that Sir R. Peel is obliged to be _cupped_ once a-week, and could not  possibly take office. Who is to take helm in the troubled ocean, no  one knows. I am glad that Metternich has been kicked out, for he and  Louis Philippe are the men that have put in peril the peace and  institutions of all Europe. I only wish that the middle class was as  strong in France as it is in England; it is no doubt infinitely  stronger than it was; while the lower order is better than that of  England, I believe, for such occasions. They have good men now in the  provisional Government--so they had in 1788; and, like them, the  present men will probably be swept away by the mob. They are not,  however, likely to be embarrassed by other nations, since the days of  Pitt and George III. are passed away, and so are the feudal times  when the barons could get up civil wars for their own selfish  purposes. There are no characters sufficiently prominent to get up a  civil war, but the enormous size of the army is enough to create  feelings of disquiet. It is, however, officered from the middle  classes, who have property at stake, and must be more or less  interested in the preservation of order.    The Government has no money to send to Algiers, and must reduce its  strength there, so that Egypt is in no danger at present; were it so,  we should be called upon to defend it from India, and could well do  so. It is evident that the whole French nation was alienated from  Louis Philippe, and prepared to cast off him and all his family,  though, as you say, I do not believe that there was anywhere any  design to oust him and put down monarchy. Had he thrown off Guizot a  little sooner, and left some able military leaders free to act, the  _emeute_ would have been put down; but those who could have acted did  not feel free to do so: they did not feel sure of the king, while  they were sure of the odium of the people. I am not at all sorry for  the change. I am persuaded that it will work good for Europe; but  still its peace and best institutions are in peril at present. We are  in no danger here, because people do not understand such things; and  because England is in a prouder position than ever, and will, I  trust, retain it.    Lord Grey seems an able man at home, but he is, I believe, hot-  headed, and Lord Stanley is ten times worse; he would soon have up  the barricades in London. Lord Clarendon seems a safe guide, but  _Peel_ is the man for the time, if he has the stamina. Lord  Palmerston has conducted the duties of his office with admirable tact  of late; and much of the good feeling that prevails in Europe towards  England at present seems to arise from it. Amelie begs to be most  kindly remembered; she is here with her little boy--two girls at  Munsoorie, and two girls and a boy at home.                  Yours very sincerely,                  (Signed)     W. H. SLEEMAN.    To the Hon. Sir T. H. Maddock,           &c. &c. &c.                   ______________________________                                          Jhansee, 14th May, 1848.    My Dear Weston,    I have been directed by Government to name an officer whom I may  consider competent to superintend the suppression of Thuggee in the  Punjaub, where a new class has been discovered, and some progress has  been made in finding and arresting them. I have, in reply, mentioned  that I should have Captain Williams, of the 29th, and Captain  Chambers, of the 21st; but their services might not be considered  available, since the prescribed number of captains are already absent  from their regiments, and, in consequence, I have you. I know not  whether you will like the duties; if not, pray tell me as soon as  possible.    The salary is 700 rupees a-month, with office-rent 40, and  establishments 152. The duties are interesting and important; and so  good a foundation has been laid by Larkins and the other local  authorities, and all are so anxious to have the evil put down, that  you will have the most cordial support and co-operation of all, and  the fairest prospect of success. But you will have to apply yourself  steadily to work, and if you have not _passed_, you should do so as  soon as possible. I do not see P. opposite your name, and Government  may possibly object on this ground. Let all this be _entre nous_ for  the present.    If you undertake the duties, you will have to go to Lodheeana, seeing  Major Graham at Agra, on the way, to get a little insight into the  work.                      Yours sincerely,                (Signed)         W. H. SLEEMAN.    P.S.--You will be in the most interesting scene in India, and need be  under no apprehension about the permanency of the appointment.    To Lieut. Weston,      &c. &c.                     ________________________________                                              Jhansee, 18th May, 1848.  My Dear Maddock,    Things are not going on so well as could be wished in the Punjaub;  and it appears to me that we have been there committing an error of  the same kind that we committed in Afghanistan--that is, taking upon  ourselves the most odious part of the executive administration. In  such a situation this should have been avoided, if possible. There is  a kind of chivalry in this--if there is anything odious to be done,  or repugnant to the feelings of the people, a young Englishman thinks  he must do it himself, lest he should be thought disposed to shift  off a painful burthen upon others; and he thinks it unbecoming of us  to pay any regard to popular feeling. Of course, also, the officers  of the Sikh State are glad to get rid of such burthens while they see  English gentlemen ready to carry them. Now, it strikes me that we  might, with a little tact, have altered all this, and retained the  good feelings of the people, by throwing the executive upon the  officers of the Sikh State, and remaining ourselves in the dignified  position of Appellate Courts for the redress of grievances inflicted  by these officers in neglect of duty or abuse of authority. Our duty  would have been to guide, control, and check, and the head of all  might have been like the sovereigns of England--known only by his  acts of grace.    By keeping in this dignified position we should not only have  retained the good feelings of the people, but we should have been  teaching the Sikh officers their administrative duties till the time  comes for making over the country; and the chief and Court would have  found the task, made over to them under such a system, more easy to  sustain. In Afghanistan we did the reverse of all this, and became  intolerably odious to the mass of the people; for they saw that  everything that was harsh was done by us, and the officers of the  King were disposed to confirm and increase this impression because  they were not employed. The people of the Punjaub are not such  fanatics, and they are more divided in creed and caste, while they  see no ranges of snowy mountains, barren rocks, and difficult passes  between us and our reinforcements and resources; but it seems clear  that there is a good deal of excitement and bad feeling growing up  amongst them that may be very mischievous. All the newspapers,  English and native, make the administration appear to be altogether  English--it is Captain This, Mr. That, who do, or are expected to do,  everything; and all over the country the native chiefs will think,  that the leaving the country to the management of the Sirdars was a  mere mockery and delusion.
