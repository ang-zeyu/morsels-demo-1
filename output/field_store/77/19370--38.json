The buds are in clusters,      and the terminal twigs, Fig. 31, are quite red.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Leaf of the Silver Maple.]    Leaf: Whitish underneath with three-pointed lobes. Fig. 32.    Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a narrow, round head.    Range: Eastern North America.    Soil and location: Prefers moist places.    Enemies: Leaf blotches (_Rhytisma acerinum_) which, however, are not      very injurious.    Value for planting: Suitable as a shade tree for suburban streets. Its      rich red leaves in the fall make it attractive for the lawn.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Bark of the Red Maple.]    Commercial value: Its wood is heavy, close-grained, and takes a good      polish. Used for furniture and fuel.    Other characters: The _bud_ is small, round, and red. The _flowers_      appear before the leaves are out in the early part of April.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Twig of the Red Maple.]    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Leaf of the Red Maple.]    Other common names: The red maple is sometimes known as _swamp maple_.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Twig of Norway Maple.]    Comparisons: The red maple is apt to be confused with the silver maple,      but the latter can be distinguished by its turned-up twigs and scaly      bark over the whole trunk of the tree, which presents a sharp      contrast to the straight twig and smooth bark of the red maple. The      latter has a bark similar to the beech, but its branches are      _opposite_, while those of the beech are _alternate_.      NORWAY MAPLE (_Acer platanoides_)    Distinguishing characters: The bud, Fig. 33, is *oval and reddish-brown*      in color; when taken off, a *milky juice exudes*. The bark is close.      Fig. 34    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Bark of Norway Maple.]    Leaf: Like the leaf of the sugar maple but thicker in texture and darker      in color. Fig. 35.    Form and size: A tall tree with a broad, round head.    Range: Europe and the United States.    Soil and location: Will grow in poor soil.    Enemies: Very few.    Value for planting: One of the best shade trees.    Commercial value: None.    Other characters: The _bark_ is close like that of the mockernut      hickory.    Comparisons: The Norway maple is apt to be confused with the _sycamore      maple_ (_Acer pseudoplatanus_), but differs from the latter in      having a reddish bud instead of a green bud, and a close bark      instead of a scaly bark.      BOX ELDER (_Acer negundo_)    Distinguishing characters: The terminal *twigs are green*, and the buds      are round and small. Fig. 36.    Leaf: Has three to seven leaflets.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Leaf of Norway Maple.]    Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a short trunk and wide-spreading      top.    Range: Eastern United States to the Rocky Mountains.    Soil and location: Grows rapidly in deep, moist soil and river valleys,      but accommodates itself to the dry and poor soil conditions of the      city.    [Illustration: Figure 36.--Twig of the Box Elder.]    Enemies: Few.    Value for planting: Used as a shade tree in the Middle West, but the      tree is so ill formed and so short-lived that it is not to be      recommended.    Commercial value: None. The wood is soft.    Other characters: The _bark_ of the trunk is smooth and yellowish-green      in young trees and grayish brown in older specimens. The _flowers_      appear in the early part of April. The _fruit_ takes the form of      yellowish-green keys which hang on the tree till late fall.    Other common names: The box elder is also commonly known as the      _ash-leaf maple_.        GROUP VI. TREES TOLD BY THEIR FORM: ELM, POPLAR, GINGKO AND WILLOW    How to tell them from other trees: The trees described in this group are      so distinctive in their general _form_ that they may, for the      purpose of study, be grouped together, and distinguished from all      other trees by this characteristic.    How to tell them from each other: The American elm is _vase-like_ in      shape; the Lombardy poplar is narrow and _spire-like_; the gingko,      or maidenhair tree, is _odd_ in its mode of _branching_; and the      weeping willow is extremely _pendulous_.      AMERICAN ELM (_Ulmus americana_)    Distinguishing characters: The tree can be told at a glance by its      general branching habit. The limbs arch out into a wide-spreading      *fan or vase-like crown* which loses itself in numerous fine      drooping branchlets. See Fig. 37.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--American Elm.]    Leaf: The leaves are simple, alternate, and from 2 to 5 inches long.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--English Elm in Winter.]    Form and size: It is a tall tree with a trunk that divides a short      distance above ground. Its general contour, together with the      numerous branches that interlace its massive crown, give the elm an      interesting and stately appearance which is unequaled by any other      tree.    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Lombardy Poplar.]    Range: Eastern North America.    Soil and location: The elm prefers a deep, rich and moist soil, but will      adapt itself even to the poor soil of the city street.    Enemies: _The leopard moth_, a wood-boring insect, and the _elm leaf      beetle_, a leaf-eating insect, are the two most important enemies of      the tree. Their ravages are very extensive.    Value for planting: The tree has a character of its own which cannot be      duplicated for avenue or lawn planting.    Commercial value: The wood is strong and tough and therefore has a      special value for cooperage, agricultural implements, carriages, and      shipbuilding.    Other characters: The _buds_ are small, brown, and smooth, while those      of the European elms are covered with down. The _small side twigs_      come out at almost right angles to the larger terminal twigs, which      is not the case in other species of elm.    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Leaf of Carolina Poplar.]    Other common names: _White elm_.    Comparisons: The _English elm_ (_Ulmus campestris_) is also a tall,      dignified tree commonly seen under cultivation in America, but may      be told from the American species by the difference in their general      contour. The branches of the English species spread out but do not      arch like those of the American elm, and the bark of the English elm      is darker and coarser, Fig. 38. Little tufts of dead twigs along the      main branches and trunk of the tree are characteristic of the      English elm and will frequently help to distinguish it from the      American elm.        The _Camperdown elm_ may be recognized readily by its dwarf size and      its low drooping umbrella-shaped crown.      LOMBARDY OR ITALIAN POPLAR (_Populus nigra, var. italica_)    Distinguishing characters: Its *tall, slender, spire-like form* and      rigidly *erect branches*, which commence low on the trunk, make this      tree very distinct at all seasons of the year. See Fig. 39.    Leaf: Triangular in shape, similar to that of the Carolina poplar but      smaller, see Fig. 40.    Range: Asia, Europe, and North America.    Soil and location: The poplar is easily grown in poor soil, in any      location, and is very hardy.    Value for planting: The tree has a distinctive form which makes it      valuable for special landscape effects. It is also used for shelter      belts and screening. Like all poplars it is short lived and will      stand pruning well.    Commercial value: None.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Carolina Poplar.]    Comparisons: The _Carolina poplar_, or Cottonwood (_Populus deltoides_)      can be told from the Lombardy poplar by its wider crown and its more      open branching, Fig. 41. It may be recognized by its big terminal      twigs, which are light yellow in color and coarser than those of the      Lombardy poplar, Fig. 42. Its bark is smooth, light and      yellowish-green in young trees, and dark gray and fissured in older      specimens. Its large, conical, glossy, chestnut-brown bud is also      characteristic, Fig. 42. Its flowers, in the form of large catkins,      a peculiarity of all poplars, appear in the early spring. The      Carolina poplar is commonly planted in cities because it grows      rapidly and is able to withstand the smoke and drouth conditions of      the city. Where other trees, however, can be substituted with      success, the poplar should be avoided. Its very fast growth is      really a point against the tree, because it grows so fast that it      becomes too tall for surrounding property, and its wood being      extremely soft and brittle, the tree frequently breaks in      windstorms. In many cases it is entirely uprooted, because it is not      a deep-rooted tree. Its larger roots, which spread near the      surface, upset the sidewalk or prevent the growth of other      vegetation on the lawn, while its finer rootlets, in their eager      search for moisture, penetrate and clog the joints of neighboring      water and sewer pipes. The tree is commonly attacked by the      _oyster-shell scale_, an insect which sucks the sap from its bark      and which readily spreads to other more valuable trees like the elm.      The female form of this tree is even more objectionable than the      male, because in the early spring the former produces an abundance      of cotton from its seeds which litters the ground and often makes      walking dangerous. The only justification for planting the Carolina      poplar is in places where the conditions for tree growth are so poor      that nothing else will grow, and in those cases the tree should be      cut back periodically in order to keep it from becoming too tall and      scraggly. It is also desirable for screening in factory districts      and similar situations.

As for the sprite of  1581 introduced by Beristain, Retana dismissed it on the grounds of  insufficient evidence. In a word, he concluded that the first book  issued in the Philippines was a Doctrina printed from wood-blocks  in 1593.    All subsequent writers on the subject have derived their information  from the sources we have already mentioned, and to a great degree  have been influenced by the findings of Medina and Retana. The  Rev. Thomas Cooke Middleton [50] in 1900 confessed that he did not  know what the first book printed was. Pardo de Tavera maintained his  old intransigence, when in the introduction to his bibliography for  the Library of Congress in 1903 he wrote that Medina's affirmation  that printing took place in 1593 \"loses all validity in the face of  the categorical statement of F. Alonso Fernandez.\" [51] Medina did  not comment further in his _Adiciones y Ampliaciones_ [52] of 1904,  yet when the same year Perez and Gueemes [53] published their additions  to and continuation of Medina, bringing his bibliography down to  1850, they resurrected the 1581 _Arte_, but added no new evidence  to prove their case. Blair and Robertson, in their tremendous,  collective history of the Philippines, did not include a list of  Philippine imprints in their bibliography, [54] but referred readers  to Medina and Retana with whom they agreed. To celebrate the three  hundredth anniversary of typographical printing in the Philippines  Artigas y Cuerva [55] wrote a study which emphasized the part played  by Blancas de San Jose, but did not deny the existence of the 1593  Doctrina. Retana [56] in 1911 brought his work on the subject up to  date, but retained all his major conclusions. In Palau's standard  bibliography of Spanish books we find the Doctrinas called \"the two  earliest books known to have been printed in Manila.\" [57] Finally, the  most thorough recent work on the subject is to be found in Schilling's  [58] survey of the early history of the Philippine press published in  1937. There is little that can be added to the evidence uncovered by  these modern writers, but the appearance of the book itself enables  us to say with certainty some things which they were able only to  surmise. However, as regards the authorship and the circumstances and  place of printing we are able, from the information given on the title,  to carry the investigation somewhat further.          THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE TEXT      The title tells us that the book was \"corrected\" by the priests of  more than one order, and since it was printed by the Dominicans,  we can assume that the ultimate responsibility for the preparation  of the text in consultation with friars of other orders also lay  in their hands. Our problem then is to discover what texts were  available to them in 1593 and who were the priests who formed the  editorial board. We have included in this study also the origins of  the Chinese text, for the two Doctrinas appeared at the same time,  and as we shall see the same Dominicans were probably responsible for  the production and preparation of both the Tagalog and the Chinese  texts. During the period under discussion there were priests of four  orders active in the islands, and so we shall speak in turn of the  Augustinian, Franciscan, Jesuit and Dominican fathers who might have  written or worked on the Doctrinas printed in 1593.        THE AUGUSTINIANS      The first priests to come to the Philippines were six Augustinians  who accompanied Legazpi on the expedition which in 1565 established  the first permanent European settlement in the islands. Among them  was Martin de Rada, who was one of the most important and influential  priests during the early days of the Spanish colony, and who was the  first linguist of note to work in the Philippines. The first language  he learned was Visayan, [59] native to the island of Cebu where the  Spaniards first landed, but he also learned Chinese. In May 1572 he  was elected provincial of his order, and in June 1575 he went with  Jeronimo Marin, as ambassador to China, being \"the first Spaniard  who entered into that said kingdom.\" [60] In preparation for the  voyage, we are told by Gonzalez de Mendoza, whose famous and popular  history of China first printed in 1585 derives in a great measure from  information brought back by Rada, that Rada \"began with great care &  studie to learne that language [Chinese], the which he learned in  few daies: & did make thereof a dictionarie.\" [61] Rada was then not  only the first to write in Visayan, but also the first to compile a  Chinese dictionary, and more important still brought back with him  to Manila from China many books of which Mendoza gives a list. [62]  These books, printed in the usual Chinese method from wood-blocks,  could have provided models for the Spaniards in the Philippines who  lacked European facilities for printing, and they may have given  birth to the idea which resulted in the xylographic Doctrinas.    Within the first few years several more Augustinian fathers [63]  arrived whose linguistic accomplishments are briefly noted by the  historians, but while these men were certainly pioneers in the speaking  of Tagalog and Chinese, they are not recorded as having written in  the language. According to Cano, [64] the first Tagalog grammar was  written by Agustin de Alburquerque, and Retana [65] considered him  one of the possible authors of the present Doctrina. This friar  reached the Philippines in 1571, accompanied Rada on his second  expedition to China in 1576, was elected provincial in 1578, and died  in 1580. However, there is no early record saying that Alburquerque  wrote any linguistic work. The statement was not made until the 19th  century, and in contradiction Juan de Medina, who wrote in 1630,  said that Juan de Quinones \"made a grammar and lexicon of the Tagal  language, which was the first to make a start in the rules of its  mode of speech.\" [66] Furthermore, in the official acts [67] of the  Augustinian province we find that on August 20, 1578 Alburquerque  as provincial of the order commissioned Quinones to write a grammar,  dictionary and confessionary in the Tagalog language. The conclusions  of Santiago de Vela [68] are that it is doubtful that Alburquerque  wrote any linguistic works, and if he did they were liable to have  been rough preliminary studies [69] upon which the texts of Quinones  were based. In view of the lack of positive contemporary evidence  [70] we believe that Alburquerque may be eliminated except as the  instigator of such works, and we return again to Juan de Quinones.    In so far as Quinones [71] was the author of a grammar and dictionary  claimed to have been printed at Manila in 1581, we have shown what  various writers have said, and though we must conclude that the work  was probably not printed, it is certain that he wrote in the Tagalog  language. Agustin Maria de Castro [72] said, although no earlier  writers support it, that Quinones actually presented a grammar,  dictionary and Doctrina in Tagalog at the Synod of 1582 for its  approval. Our total information about this Augustinian linguist boils  down to these essentials: that he did write a grammar and dictionary  of Tagalog about 1578-81, which may have been the earliest written  in the Philippines; that he may have presented these and a Doctrina  at the Synod of 1582 which approved Juan de Plasencia's works; that  there is no concrete evidence that any of these works were printed;  and that Quinones' works which were extant in manuscript in 1593  might have been consulted in the preparation of the present Doctrina.    Another member of the Order of St. Augustine who might have been  able to participate in the editing of the 1593 Doctrinas was Diego  Munoz. Munoz came to the islands in 1578, and died in 1594. Of him  San Agustin writes:          \"Moreover in this year [1581] the ministry for the Sangleys      was founded in the convent of Tondo, and P. Fr. Diego Munoz      was named as its special minister. He devoted particular      zeal to the study of the Chinese language, and preached in      it with much elegance. And all the Sangleys who were going      to be baptized, and there were many, had recourse to this      ministry, and the teaching was continued with much vigilance      and care. And there never lacked a religious of our order      to apply himself to such holy work, from the time we came to      this land, as our original records of the province prove.\" [73]      To him is also attributed [74] a volume of manuscript panegyric sermons  in Tagalog, and because of this and his work at Tondo he may have  been consulted by the Dominicans. We also mention Lorenzo de Leon,  [75] who arrived in 1582, spent twelve years in the provinces, wrote  a book called the _Estrella del mar_ in Tagalog, and died in 1623,  and might also have helped.          THE FRANCISCANS      Although the first Franciscans did not arrive in the Philippines  until June 24, 1577, the writings of the linguists of that order  are more fully recorded. Among the earliest was Juan de Plasencia  who, the Franciscans claim, wrote the first Tagalog grammar. He was  fortunate in meeting soon after his arrival Miguel de Talavera, [76]  who had come with his parents on the expedition of Legazpi. Miguel,  then quite young, became in a manner of speaking the disciple of  Plasencia, and while the father taught him "]]]
