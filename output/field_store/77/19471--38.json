When James returned home to dinner, his mother related to him the whole  conversation. James was more amused than puzzled.    \"It seems a rum idea, mother; but I don't see why you shouldn't take  her. She is a sweet little thing, and will be a great amusement. Fifty  pounds a year seems a tremendous sum for a man like that to pay; but I  suppose he knows his own business, and it will be a great pull for you.  You will be able to have all sorts of comforts. I should like it very  much. I have often wished I had had a little sister, and she can go out  walks with me, you know. It would be like having a big dog with one,  only much jollier.\"    \"Yes,\" his mother said smiling; \"and I shouldn't be surprised if you  wanted to throw sticks into the water for her to fetch them out, and to  be taking her out for a night's fishing, and be constantly bringing her  home splashed with that nasty red mud from head to foot. You would be a  nice playmate for a little girl, Jim. Perhaps it is that special  advantage that the sergeant had in his mind's eye, when he was so  anxious to put her with me.\"    James laughed.    \"I would see that she didn't come to any harm, anyhow, you know; and,  after all, I suppose it was my picking her out of the sea that had  something to do with his first thinking of putting her with you.\"    \"I suppose it had, Jim,\" she said more seriously. \"But what do you  think, my boy? You know there are disadvantages in it. There will be a  good deal of talk about my taking this showman's grandchild, and some  of the farmers' wives won't like it.\"    \"Then let them dislike it,\" James said indignantly. \"The child is as  good as their daughters, any day. Why, I noticed her in church looking  like a little lady. There was not a child there to compare to her.\"    \"Yes, I have noticed her myself,\" Mrs. Walsham said. \"She is a  singularly pretty and graceful child; but it will certainly cause  remark.\"    \"Well, mother, you can easily say, what is really the fact, that you  naturally felt an interest in her because I picked her out of the  water. Besides, if people make remarks they will soon be tired of that;  and if not, I can get into some scrape or other and give them something  else to talk about.\"    Accordingly, when Sergeant Wilks called on Monday morning for his  answer, Mrs. Walsham told him that she had decided to accept his offer.    \"You are aware how I am placed,\" she said, \"and that I cannot give her  the care and time which I could wish, and which she ought to have for  such a liberal payment as you propose; but you know that beforehand,  and you see that for two years' payments I could not sacrifice my  school connection, which I should have to do if I gave her the time I  should wish.\"    \"I understand, madam,\" he said, \"and I am grateful to you for  consenting to take her. She is getting too old now to wander about with  me, and since the narrow escape she had, last time I was here, I have  felt anxious whenever she was out of my sight. It would not suit me to  put her in a farm house. I want her to learn to speak nicely, and I  have done my best to teach her; but if she went to a farm house she  would be picking up all sorts of country words, and I want her to talk  like a little lady.    \"So that is settled, ma'm. I am going on to Exeter from here, and shall  get her a stock of clothes there, and will bring her back next  Saturday. Will it suit you to take her then?\"    Mrs. Walsham said that would suit very well; and an hour later the  sergeant set out from Sidmouth with his box, Aggie trotting alongside,  talking continuously.    \"But why am I to stop with that lady, grampa, and not to go about with  you any more? I sha'n't like it. I like going about, though I get so  tired sometimes when you are showing the pictures; and I like being  with you. It isn't 'cause I have been naughty, is it? 'Cause I fell out  of the boat into the water? I won't never get into a boat again, and I  didn't mean to fall out, you know.\"    \"No, Aggie, it's not that,\" the sergeant said. \"You are always a good  girl--at least, not always, because sometimes you get into passions,  you know. Still, altogether you are a good little girl. Still, you see,  you can't always be going about the country with me.\"    \"But why not, grampa?\"    \"Well, my dear, because great girls can't go about the country like  men. It wouldn't be right and proper they should.\"    \"Why shouldn't it be, grampa?\" the child persisted.    \"Well, Aggie, I can't exactly explain to you why, but so it is. Men and  boys have to work. They go about in ships, or as soldiers to fight for  their country, just as I did. Girls and women have to stop at home, and  keep house, and nurse babies, and that sort of thing. God made man to  be hard and rough, and to work and go about. He made woman gentle and  soft, to stop at home and make things comfortable.\"    Aggie meditated for some distance, in silence, upon this view of the  case.    \"But I have seen women working in the fields, grampa, and some of them  didn't seem very soft and gentle.\"    \"No, Aggie, things don't always go just as they ought to do; and you  see, when people are poor, and men can't earn enough wages, then their  wives and daughters have to help; and then, you see, they get rough,  more like men, because they are not doing their proper work. But I want  you to grow up soft and gentle, and so, for a time, I want you to live  with that lady with the nice boy who pulled you out of the water, and  they will make you very happy, and I shall come and see you sometime.\"    \"I like him,\" the child said with a nod; \"but I would rather be with  you, you know.\"    \"And the lady will teach you to read, Aggie. You have learned your  letters, you know.\"    Aggie shook her head, to show that this part of the programme was not  particularly to her liking.    \"Do you think the boy will play with me, grampa?\"    \"I daresay he will, Aggie, when you are very good; and you must never  forget, you know, that he saved your life. Just think how unhappy I  should be, if he had not got you out of the water.\"    \"The water was cold and nasty,\" Aggie said, \"and it seemed so warm and  nice to my hands. Aggie won't go near the water any more. Of course, if  the boy is with me I can go, because he won't let me tumble in.    \"Shall I get into the basket now, grampa? I is tired.\"    \"Oh, nonsense, little woman! you have not walked half a mile yet.  Anyhow, you must trot along until you get to the top of this hill, then  you shall have a lift for a bit.\"    And so, with the child sometimes walking and sometimes riding,  sometimes asleep in her basket and sometimes chatting merrily to her  grandfather, the pair made their way across the country towards Exeter.    There was no little talk in Sidmouth when, on the following Sunday, the  showman's grandchild appeared in Mrs. Walsham's pew in church, and it  became known that she had become an inmate of her house. It was  generally considered that Mrs. Walsham had let herself down greatly by  taking the showman's grandchild, and one or two of the mothers of her  pupils talked about taking them away. One or two, indeed, called upon  her to remonstrate personally, but they gained nothing by the step.    \"I do not understand what you mean,\" she said quietly, \"by saying that  the child is not fit to associate with my other pupils. She is  singularly gentle and taking in her manner. She expresses herself  better than any child of her own age in Sidmouth, so far as I know.  There are few so neatly and prettily dressed. What is there to object  to? Her grandfather has been a sergeant in the army. He bears a good  character, and is liked wherever he goes. I do not consider that James  or myself are, in any way, demeaned by sitting down to meals with the  child, who, indeed, behaves as prettily and nicely as one could wish;  and I certainly do not see that any of my pupils can be injuriously  affected by the fact that, for an hour or two in the day, she learns  her lessons in the same room with them. Had I thought that they would  be, I should not have received her. I shall, of course, be sorry if any  of my pupils are taken away, but as I have several girls only waiting  for vacancies, it would make no difference to me pecuniarily.\"    And so it happened that Mrs. Walsham lost none of her pupils, and in a  short time the wonder died out. Indeed, the child herself was so  pretty, and taking in her ways, that it was impossible to make any  objection to her personally.    Mrs. Walsham had been struck by the self command which she showed at  parting with her grandfather. Her eyes were full of tears, her lip  quivered, and she could scarcely speak; but there was no loud wailing,  no passionate outburst. Her grandfather had impressed upon her that the  parting was for her own good, and child though she was, she felt how  great a sacrifice he was making in parting with her, and although she  could not keep the tears from streaming down her cheeks, or silence her  sobs as she bade him goodbye, she tried hard to suppress her grief.    The pain of parting was, indeed, fully as great to Sergeant Wilks as to  his granddaughter; and it was with a very husky voice that he bade her  goodbye, and then, putting her into Mrs. Walsham's arms, walked hastily  away.    Aggie was soon at home. She and James very quickly became allies, and  the boy was ever ready to amuse her, often giving up his own plans to  take her for a walk to pick flowers in the hedgerow, or to sail a tiny  boat for her in the pools left as the sea retired. Mrs. Walsham found,  to her surprise, that the child gave little trouble. She was quiet and  painstaking during the half hours in the morning and afternoon when she  was in the school room, while at mealtimes her prattle and talk amused  both mother and son, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#5)"],[1,"past too. However, I  shall consider myself happy when someone comes to take me out of this  place.\"    But would this ever happen? Yes; one morning people came to clear up  the garret; the boxes were packed away, and the tree was pulled out of  the corner and thrown roughly on the floor; then the servants dragged  it out upon the staircase where the daylight shone.    \"Now life is beginning again,\" said the tree, rejoicing in the  sunshine and fresh air. Then it was carried downstairs and taken into  the courtyard so quickly that it forgot to think of itself, and could  only look about, there was so much to be seen.    The court was close to a garden, where everything looked blooming.  Fresh and fragrant roses hung over the little palings. The linden  trees were in blossom; while the swallows flew here and there crying,  \"Twit, twit, twit, my mate is coming;\" but it was not the fir tree  they meant.    \"Now I shall live,\" cried the tree joyfully, spreading out its  branches; but alas! they were all withered and yellow, and it lay in a  corner amongst weeds and nettles. The star of gold paper still stuck  in the top of the tree, and glittered in the sunshine.    In the same courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had  danced round the tree at Christmas time and had been so happy. The  youngest saw the gilded star and ran and pulled it off the tree. \"Look  what is sticking to the ugly old fir tree,\" said the child, treading  on the branches till they crackled under his boots.    And the tree saw all the fresh, bright flowers in the garden, and  then looked at itself, and wished it had remained in the dark corner  of the garret. It thought of its fresh youth in the forest, of the  merry Christmas evening, and of the little mice who had listened to  the story of Humpty-Dumpty.    \"Past! past!\" said the poor tree. \"Oh, had I but enjoyed myself while  I could have done so! but now it is too late.\"    Then a lad came and chopped the tree into small pieces, till a large  bundle lay in a heap on the ground. The pieces were placed in the  fire, and they blazed up brightly, while the tree sighed so deeply  that each sigh was like a little pistol shot. Then the children, who  were at play, came and seated themselves in front of the fire and  looked at it, and cried, \"Pop, pop.\" But at each \"pop,\" which was a  deep sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer day in the forest, or of  some winter night there when the stars shone brightly, and of  Christmas evening and of Humpty-Dumpty, the only story it had ever  heard, or knew how to relate,--till at last it was consumed.    The boys still played in the garden, and the youngest wore the golden  star on his breast with which the tree had been adorned during the  happiest evening of its existence. Now all was past; the tree's life  was past, and the story also past! for all stories must come to an end  some time or other.    [*] From \"Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales,\" adapted by J. H. Stickney.

THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL[*]    Hans Andersen      It was dreadfully cold; it was snowing fast, and was almost dark, as  evening came on--the last evening of the year. In the cold and the  darkness, there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded  and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is  true; but they were much too large for her feet,--slippers that her  mother had used until then, and the poor little girl lost them in  running across the street when two carriages were passing terribly  fast. When she looked for them, one was not to be found, and a boy  seized the other and ran away with it, saying he would use it for a  cradle some day, when he had children of his own.    So on the little girl went with her bare feet, that were red and blue  with cold. In an old apron that she wore were bundles of matches, and  she carried a bundle also in her hand. No one had bought so much as a  bunch all the long day, and no one had given her even a penny.    Poor little girl! Shivering with cold and hunger she crept along, a  perfect picture of misery!    The snowflakes fell on her long flaxen hair, which hung in pretty  curls about her throat; but she thought not of her beauty nor of the  cold. Lights gleamed in every window, and there came to her the savory  smell of roast goose, for it was New Year's Eve. And it was of this  which she thought.    In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected beyond the  other, she sat cowering down. She had drawn under her little feet, but  still she grew colder and colder; yet she dared not go home, for she  had sold no matches, and could not bring a penny of money. Her father  would certainly beat her; and, besides, it was cold enough at home,  for they had only the houseroof above them; and, though the largest  holes had been stopped with straw and rags, there were left many  through which the cold wind whistled.    And now her little hands were nearly frozen with cold. Alas! a single  match might do her good if she might only draw it from the bundle, rub  it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. So at last she drew  one out. Whischt! How it blazed and burned! It gave out a warm, bright  flame like a little candle, as she held her hands over it. A wonderful  little light it was. It really seemed to the little girl as if she sat  before a great iron stove, with polished brass feet and brass shovel  and tongs. So blessedly it burned that the little maiden stretched out  her feet to warm them also. How comfortable she was! But lo! the flame  went out, the stove vanished, and nothing remained but the little  burned match in her hand.    She rubbed another match against the wall. It burned brightly, and  where the light fell upon the wall it became transparent like a veil,  so that she could see through it into the room. A snow-white cloth was  spread upon the table, on which was a beautiful china dinner service,  while a roast goose, stuffed with apples and prunes, steamed famously,  and sent forth a most savory smell. And what was more delightful  still, and wonderful, the goose jumped from the dish, with knife and  fork still in its breast, and waddled along the floor straight to the  little girl.    But the match went out then, and nothing was left to her but the  thick, damp wall.    She lighted another match. And now she was under a most beautiful  Christmas tree, larger and far more prettily trimmed than the one she  had seen through the glass doors at the rich merchant's. Hundreds of  wax tapers were burning on the green branches, and gay figures, such  as she had seen in the shop windows, looked down upon her. The child  stretched out her hands to them; then the match went out.    Still the lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher. She saw  them as stars in heaven, and one of them fell, forming a long trail of  fire.    \"Now some one is dying,\" murmured the child softly; for her  grandmother, the only person who had loved her and who was now dead,  had told her that whenever a star falls a soul mounts up to God.    She struck yet another match against the wall, and again it was light;  and in the brightness there appeared before her the dear old  grandmother, bright and radiant, yet sweet and mild, and happy as she  had never looked on earth.    \"Oh, grandmother,\" cried the child, \"take me with you. I know you will  go away when the match burns out. You, too, will vanish, like the warm  stove, the splendid New Year's feast, the beautiful Christmas Tree.\"  And lest her grandmother should disappear, she rubbed the whole bundle  of matches against the wall.    And the matches burned with such a brilliant light that it became  brighter than noonday. Her grandmother had never looked so grand and  beautiful. She took the little girl in her arms, and both flew  together, joyously and gloriously, mounting higher and higher, far  above the earth; and for them there was neither hunger, nor cold, nor  care;--they were with God.    But in the corner, at the dawn of day, sat the poor girl, leaning  against the wall, with red cheeks and smiling mouth,--frozen to death  on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and cold she sat, with the  matches, one bundle of which was burned.    \"She wanted to warm herself, poor little thing,\" people said. No one  imagined what sweet visions she had had, or how gloriously she had  gone with her grandmother to enter upon the joys of a new year.

LITTLE PICCOLA[*]    Suggested by One of Mrs. Celia Thaxter's Poems         \"Story-telling is a real strengthening spirit-bath.\"--_Froebel._      Piccola lived in Italy, where the oranges grow, and where all the year  the sun shines warm and bright. I suppose you think Piccola a very  strange name for a little girl; but in her country it was not strange  at all, and her mother thought it the sweetest name a little girl ever  had.    Piccola had no kind father, no big brother or sister, and no sweet  baby to play with and love. She and her mother lived all alone in an  old stone house that looked on a dark, narrow street. They were very  poor, and the mother was away from home almost every day, washing  clothes and scrubbing floors, and working hard to earn money for her  little girl and herself. So you see Piccola was alone a great deal of  the time; and if she had not been a very happy, contented little  child, I hardly know what she would have done. She had no playthings  except a heap of stones in the back yard that she used for building  houses and a very old, very ragged doll that her mother had found in  the street one day.    But there was a small round hole in the stone wall at the back of her  yard, and her greatest pleasure was to look through that into her  neighbor's garden. When she stood on a stone, and put her eyes close  to the hole, she could"]]]
