With all the patience of Job, and the  meekness of Moses, I awaited my time, and finally obtained my  information.    The impatience of such minds in narrative is amusing.  Let us suppose  that I am asking some _kushto Rommany chal_ for a version of AEsop's  fable of the youth and the cat.  He is sitting comfortably by the fire,  and good ale has put him into a story-telling humour.  I begin--    \"Now then, tell me this _adree Rommanis_, in Gipsy--Once upon a time  there was a young man who had a cat.\"    Gipsy.--\"_Yeckorus--'pre yeck cheirus_--_a raklo lelled a matchka_\"--    While I am writing this down, and long before it is half done, the  professor of Rommany, becoming interested in the subject, continues  volubly--    --\"_an' the matchka yeck sala dicked a chillico apre a rukk_--(and the  cat one morning saw a bird in a tree\"--)    I.--\"Stop, stop!  _Hatch a wongish_!  That is not it!  Now go on.  _The  young man loved this cat so much_\"--    _Gipsy_ (fluently, in Rommany), \"that he thought her skin would make a  nice pair of gloves\"--    \"Confound your gloves!  Now do begin again\"--    _Gipsy_, with an air of grief and injury: \"I'm sure I was telling the  story for you the best way I knew how!\"    Yet this man was far from being a fool.  What was it, then?  Simply and  solely, a lack of education--of that mental training which even those who  never entered a schoolhouse, receive more or less of, when they so much  as wait patiently for a month behind a chair, or tug for six months at a  plough, or in short, acquire the civilised virtue of Christian patience.  That is it.  We often hear in this world that a little education goes a  great way; but to get some idea of the immense value of a very little  education indeed, and the incredible effect it may have upon character,  one should study with gentleness and patience a real Gipsy.    Probably the most universal error in the world is the belief that all  men, due allowance being made for greater or less knowledge, or  \"talents,\" have minds like our own; are endowed with the same moral  perception, and see things on the whole very much as we do.  Now the  truth is that a Chinese, whose mind is formed, not by \"religion\" as we  understand it, but simply by the intense pressure of \"Old Custom,\" which  we do not understand, thinks in a different manner from an European;  moralists accuse him of \"moral obliquity,\" but in reality it is a moral  difference.  Docility of mind, the patriarchal principle, and the very  perfection of innumerable wise and moral precepts have, by the practice  of thousands of years, produced in him their natural result.  Whenever he  attempts to think, his mind runs at once into some broad and open path,  beautifully bordered with dry artificial flowers, {21} and the result has  been the inability to comprehend any new idea--a state to which the  Church of the Middle Ages, or any too rigidly established system, would  in a few thousand years have reduced humanity.  Under the action of  widely different causes, the gipsy has also a different cast of mind from  our own, and a radical moral difference.  A very few years ago, when I  was on the Plains of Western Kansas, old Black Kettle, a famous Indian  chief said in a speech, \"I am not a white man, I am a _wolf_.  I was born  like a wolf on the prairies.  I have lived like a wolf, and I shall die  like one.\"  Such is the wild gipsy.  Ever poor and hungry, theft seems to  him, in the trifling easy manner in which he practises it, simply a  necessity.  The moral aspects of petty crime he never considers at all,  nor does he, in fact, reflect upon anything as it is reflected on by the  humblest peasant who goes to church, or who in any way feels himself  connected as an integral part of that great body-corporate--Society.

The Old Fortune-Teller and her Brother.--The Patteran, or Gipsies' Road-  Mark .--The Christian Cross, named by Continental Gipsies Trushul, after  the Trident of Siva.--Curious English-Gipsy term for the Cross.--Ashwood  Fires on Christmas Day.--Our Saviour regarded with affection by the  Rommany because he was like themselves and poor.--Strange ideas of the  Bible.--The Oak.--Lizards renew their lives.--Snails.--Slugs.--Tobacco  Pipes as old as the world.    \"Duveleste; Avo.  Mandy's kaired my patteran adusta chairuses where a  drum jals atut the waver,\" which means in English--\"God bless you, yes.  Many a time I have marked my sign where the roads cross.\"    I was seated in the cottage of an old Gipsy mother, one of the most noted  fortune-tellers in England, when I heard this from her brother, himself  an ancient wanderer, who loves far better to hear the lark sing than the  mouse cheep when he wakes of a morning.    It was a very small but clean cottage, of the kind quite peculiar to the  English labourer, and therefore attractive to every one who has felt the  true spirit of the most original poetry and art which this country has  produced.  For look high or low, dear reader, you will find that nothing  has ever been better done in England than the pictures of rural life, and  over nothing have its gifted minds cast a deeper charm.    There were the little rough porcelain figures of which the English  peasantry are so fond, and which, cheap as they are, indicate that the  taste of your friends Lady --- for Worcester \"porcelain,\" or the Duchess  of --- for Majolica, has its roots among far humbler folk.  In fact there  were perhaps twenty things which no English reader would have supposed  were peculiar, yet which were something more than peculiar to me.  The  master of the house was an Anglo-Saxon--a Gorgio--and his wife, by some  magic or other, the oracle before-mentioned.    And I, answering said--    \"So you all call it _patteran_?\" {24}    \"No; very few of us know that name.  We do it without calling it  anything.\"    Then I took my stick and marked on the floor the following sign--    [Sign: ill24.jpg]    \"There,\" I said, \"is the oldest patteran--first of all--which the Gipsies  use to-day in foreign lands.  In Germany, when one band of Gipsies goes  by a cross road, they draw that deep in the dust, with the end of the  longest line pointing in the direction in which they have gone.  Then,  the next who come by see the mark, and, if they choose, follow it.\"    \"We make it differently,\" said the Gipsy.  \"This is our sign--the _trin  bongo drums_, or cross.\"  And he drew his patteran thus--    [Cross: ill25.jpg]    \"The long end points the way,\" he added; \"just as in your sign.\"    \"You call a cross,\" I remarked, \"_trin bongo drums_, or the three crooked  roads.  Do you know any such word as _trushul_ for it?\"    \"No; _trushilo_ is thirsty, and _trushni_ means a faggot, and also a  basket.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder if a faggot once got the old Rommany word for cross,\"  I said, \"because in it every stick is crossed by the wooden _withy_ which  binds it; and in a basket, every wooden strip crosses the other.\"    I did not, however, think it worth while to explain to the Gipsies that  when their ancestors, centuries ago, left India, it was with the memory  that Shiva, the Destroyer, bore a trident, the tri-cula in Sanscrit, the  _trisul_ of Mahadeva in Hindustani, and that in coming to Europe the  resemblance of its shape to that of the Cross impressed them, so that  they gave to the Christian symbol the name of the sacred triple spear.  {26}  For if you turn up a little the two arms of a cross, you change the  emblem of suffering and innocence at once into one of murder--just as  ever so little a deviation from goodness will lead you, my dear boy, into  any amount of devilry.    And that the unfailing lucid flash of humour may not be wanting, there  lightens on my mind the memory of _The Mysterious Pitchfork_--a German  satirical play which made a sensation in its time--and Herlossohn in his  romance of _Der Letzte Taborit_ (which helped George Sand amazingly in  Consuelo), makes a Gipsy chieftain appear in a wonderfully puzzling light  by brandishing, in fierce midnight dignity, this agricultural parody on  Neptune's weapon, which brings me nicely around to my Gipsies again.    If I said nothing to the inmates of the cottage of all that the _trushul_  or cross trident suggested, still less did I vex their souls with the  mystic possible meaning of the antique _patteran_ or sign which I had  drawn.  For it has, I opine, a deep meaning, which as one who knew  Creuzer of old, I have a right to set forth.  Briefly, then, and without  encumbering my book with masses of authority, let me state that in all  early lore, the _road_ is a symbol of life; Christ himself having used it  in this sense.  Cross roads were peculiarly meaning-full as indicating  the meet-of life with life, of good with evil, a faith of which abundant  traces are preserved in the fact that until the present generation  suicides were buried at them, and magical rites and diabolic incantations  are supposed to be most successful when practised in such places.  The  English _path_, the Gipsy patteran, the Rommany-Hindu _pat_, a foot, and  the Hindu _panth_, a road, all meet in the Sanscrit _path_, which was the  original parting of the ways.  Now the _patteran_ which I have drawn,  like the Koua of the Chinese or the mystical _Swastika_ of the Buddhists,  embraces the long line of life, or of the infinite and the short, or  broken lines of the finite, and, therefore, as an ancient magical Eastern  sign, would be most appropriately inscribed as a _sikker-paskero  dromescro_--or hand post--to show the wandering Rommany how to proceed on  their way of life.    [Svastika: ill27.jpg]    That the ordinary Christian Cross should be called by the English Gipsies  a _trin bongo drum_--or the three cross roads--is not remarkable when we  consider that their only association with it is that of a \"wayshower,\" as  Germans would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16360"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 (#5)"],[1,"form of  boiler when its enormous area of ground, brickwork, and its fittings  are considered. Not all have the money or the room for them. To  produce space, the area is drawn in sidewise and lengthwise, but we  must have the necessary amount of square feet of absorbing surface,  consequently the boiler is doubled up, so to speak, and we have a  \"flue boiler.\" We draw in sidewise and lengthwise once more and double  up the surface again, and that is a \"tubular boiler.\" That includes  all the \"mystery\" on that subject.    Now, we find among the mills, just as I imagine we should upon the  railroads, that the almost universal tendency is to put in too small  boilers and furnaces. To skimp at boilers is to spend at the coal  yard. Small boilers mean heavy and over-deep fires, and rapid  destruction of apparatus. In sugar houses you will see this frequently  illustrated, and will find 16 inch fires upon their grates.    We have found that, as we could persuade mill owners to put in more  boilers and extend their furnaces, so that coal could be burned  moderately and time for combustion afforded, we often saved as high as  1,000 tons in a yearly consumption of 4,000.    Now, when the ordinary locomotive sends particles of coal into the  cars in which I am riding, I do not think it would be unfair criticism  to say that the process of combustion was not properly carried out.  When we see dense volumes of gas emitted from the stack, it is evident  that a portion of the hard dollars which were paid for the coal are  being uselessly thrown into the air; and it will be well to remember  that only a little of the unburnt gas is visible to the eye.    One point I wish to make is this: We find, as I have said, that as we  spread out with boilers and furnaces in the mills, so that we can take  matters deliberately, we save money.    Now, coming again to locomotives. I think, if we examine the subject  carefully, the fact will strike us a little curiously. The first  locomotive built in Philadelphia weighed about 14 tons. Judging from  the cut I have seen, I should think her furnace might have been 30  inches square. We have gone from that little 14 ton engine to machines  of 50 and 60 tons--perhaps more. The engines have been increased over  four times, but I will ask you if the furnace areas have been  increased (applause) in proportion? Some of the furnaces of the  engines are six feet by three, but that is an increase of less than 3  to 1 of furnace, as against 4 to 1 of weight of engine.    When my attention was first called to this matter, I had supposed, as  most people do who are outside of the railway profession, that there  was something subtile and mysterious about railway engineering that  none but those brought up to the business could understand. Possibly  it is so, and I am merely making suggestions for what they are worth,  but I think the position I have taken in this matter was established  by some experiments of three weeks' duration, which I conducted  between Milan and Como, in Italy, for the Italian government, in  pulling freight trains up grades of 100 feet to the mile. The  experiments were made with an engine built by the Reading Railroad.    We competed with English, French, Belgian, and Austrian engines. These  machines required the best of fuel to perform the mountain service,  and could use coal dust only when it was pressed into brick. We used  in the Reading Railroad machine different fuels upon different days,  making the road trip of 120 miles each day with one kind of fuel. We  used coal dust scraped up in the yards, also the best Cardiff coal,  anthracite, and five kinds of Italian lignite, the best of which  possesses about half the combustible value of coal.    The results in drawing heavy freight trains were equally good with  each fuel, the engine having at all times an abundance of steam on  heavy grades, no smoke nor cinders, and no collection of cinders in  the forward part of the engine.    The fireman arranged his fires at a station, and did little or nothing  except to smoke his pipe and enjoy the scenery until he reached the  next station. An incident occurred to prove that we were not playing  with the machine. They told me one morning that we should be given a  load of 25 per cent less than the maximum load of an engine of her  class (30 tons). We started up the 100 foot grade, and found we could  barely crawl, and our engineer got furious over it. He thought they  were repeating a trick already attempted by screwing down a brake in  ascending a grade. We detected it, however, and found a pair of wheels  nearly red hot. Upon this occasion we found nothing amiss, except full  cars where they had reported only a light load. We pulled to the top  of the hill, the steam blowing off furiously all the time.    This was a new experience to the Italians, and might surprise some  Americans. When we arrived at the station, the inspector-general and  his corps of engineers were evidently amazed, and it was evident we  had captured them. He said to me, \"I can congratulate you, signor, on  possession of a superb machine.\"    Afterward one of the engineers said to me: \"Do not let it be known  that I told you what you have hauled or I shall lose my place, but you  have drawn 50 per cent more than the maximum load of one of our 40 ton  engines.\" I said: \"You attempted to 'stall' us, and when you try it  again, be fair enough to give me a flat of pig iron, and as you pack  cars on one end I will pack pig iron upon the engine until she will  stick to the track, but rest assured that you will not be able to get  that steam down.\" The experience with that engine proves conclusively  to my mind that the general principles of steam making are the same  for both stationary and locomotive practice. The grand secret of the  success of that Wootten engine was the enormous area of the grate  surface, being, if I remember correctly, 7 by 9 feet, permitting thin  fires to be carried and complete combustion to be obtained before the  gases reached the boiler tubes. An enormous crown sheet was presented,  and that is where the bulk of the work of any boiler is done.    Thin fires accomplish this. As already stated, a given amount of coal  generates a given amount of gas, and this gas requires a given amount  of air or oxygen. This air must be supplied through the grate bars and  then pass through the interstices of the mass of heated coal. It  requires about 10 cubic feet of air to consume one cubic foot of gas.  In stationary boilers we find that if we use \"pea\" and \"dust\" coal, an  extremely thin layer must be used, or the 10 feet of air per foot of  gas cannot pass through it; if \"chestnut\" coal be used, the thickness  may be increased somewhat; \"stove size\" allows a thickness of six  inches, and \"lump\" much thicker, if any wise man could be found who  would use that coarse, uneconomical size. Of course, I am speaking of  anthracite coal. Opinions differ about \"soft coal,\" but the same  general principle applies as regards an unobstructed passage of air  through the hot bed of coal.    Now, it will be agreed that the locomotive of the future must be  improved to keep up with the times. Fierce competition requires  increased efficiency and reduced expenses. I am told by you railroad  gentlemen that the freight business of the country doubles every ten  years. Trains follow close upon each other. What are you going to do?  Are you to double, treble, or quadruple your tracks?    It seems to me much remains yet to be done with the locomotive. We  must burn a great deal less coal for the steam we make, and after we  have made steam we must use that steam up more thoroughly. In the  short cylinder required by locomotive service, the steam, entering at  the initial pressure pushes the piston to the opposite end, and it  then rushes out of the exhaust strong enough to drive another piston.  Of every four dollars' worth of coal consumed, at least two dollars  worth is absolutely thrown away. Or, of every ten thousand dollars  spent for fuel, five thousand dollars are absolutely wasted. How can  we save this? It would seem obvious that if steam rushes from the  exhaust of an engine strong enough to drive another engine, the common  sense of the thing would be to put another engine alongside and let  the steam drive it, and we should get just so much more out of our  four dollars' worth of coal. It seems evident that we must follow the  lead of the steamship men, and compound the locomotive engine, as  they have done with the marine engine.    Next we must attack the extravagant furnace, and increase its area and  reduce the depth of the bed of coal. The difficulty of making this  change seemed to me to be removed, on examining an engine on the  Providence & Bristol Railroad, the other day. The machine was made at  the Mason Works, of Taunton. It was an engine and tender combined, the  truck being at the rear end of the tender, and the driver placed well  in advance of the fire-box, so that the maximum weight of both engine  and tender rested upon the drivers. In thus removing the drivers from  the proximity of the fire-box, abundant facility is afforded for  widening the fire-box, so as to obtain a grate area as large as that  of the Wootten engine or of a stationary boiler. It seems to me the  increase of grate area can be obtained only by widening; for a length  of more than six or seven feet is very hard upon the fireman. You  certainly cannot get more power by deepening present fire-boxes,  except by an enormously increased waste of fuel, which all will  concede is already sufficiently extravagant.    In arriving at the conclusion of these hasty and I fear somewhat  incoherent remarks, I would say that the object aimed at for the  improvement of the locomotive would be reached, first, by making steam  economically, by employing such increased grate area as will permit  running thin fires and moderate or"]]]
