Of the Verb _Mucún_, I die, compounds such as these are made:  vrumucún, I die of heat; vrúcóome, they die of heat; hisú-mucún, I  die of hunger; hisúmcóome, they die of hunger; varótmucún, I die of  thirst; varó-coóme, they die of thirst; cúmemucún, I die of envy;  cumecoáme, they die of envy. Vrútzen is, I have heat; hisúmtzen, I  have hunger; veráctzen, I have thirst; cúmen, I have envy. The reason  of changing mucún to form the plural may be seen in section 36.    NEOQUEN.    41. Neóquen, means I command, and observe this method as respects its  use: Nee uneóquen, and I command to bring; nee nerta neóquen, and I  command, to pray; nee ouit neóquen, and I command to call. Vtze is  the future of vun, I bring; nertátze, I pray, the future of nértaan:  ouictze the future of ouican, I call; so that the tze is taken from  the future, and neóquen is placed in its stead. Notice, likewise, this  method: Nap ca istutándauh, It is commanded not to lie.    So far of the verbs, which as well other parts of speech all the  Indians use with nicety and elegance. For their conjugation, a  single exemplar has been given; but their perfects and futures being  differently formed, which are the roots whence the other tenses  spring, they have been placed in the vocabulary added to the verbs, a  knowledge of which will suffice to form all the other times.           *       *       *       *       *      PARTICIPLE.    42. The verbs become participles without undergoing change of form,  as, hiósguam, I write, or he that writes, is the present participle;  hiósguari, I have written, or he that has written; hiósguatze, I will  write, or he that will, is the preterite (future?) participle. The  same in its proportion is to be understood of the passive voice.    The _Present Participle_ is of the second declension, forming the  genitive in te, thus Nominative, hiósguan; Genitive, hiósgnante,  etc. The imperfect participle is of the same declension, with the  difference that the mark of the imperfect, ru, is the final, as, Nom.  hiósguamru, Gen. hiósguamteru, etc.    The _Perfect Participle_ is of the first declension, having its  genitive in que, as, Nom. hiósguari, Gen. hiósguarique.    _Pluperfect Participle_ is declined like the perfect, observing  what has been said of the imperfect, as, Nom. hiósguariru, Gen.  hiósguariqueru, etc.    The _Future Participle_ belongs to the second declension, the  genitive ending in te, preceded by n or m, as, Nom. hiósguatze, Gen.  hiósguatzente.    The plural, it appears, should be declined in the same manner as the  singular in respect of its termination in te or que.           *       *       *       *       *      PREPOSITION.    43. The prepositions that govern the genitive might with reason be  called postpositions, since they follow the case; for Pedro Pedroque  betzégnai, with you amó ma.           *       *       *       *       *      ADVERB.    The adverbs are very many, and by them more especially is expressed  the manner of walking, of sitting, of sounding, etc., and oftentimes  the enunciation copies after the sense, as, cúusan, I sound; catzcatze  cúusan, clattering sound.           *       *       *       *       *      INTERJECTION.    45. Some of the interjections are these: Ari! and when repeated ari,  ari! are those of one feeling pain; Asioma is of one that menaces,  like, You will see! and Asma is like, I desire to see! Hábesa  matzi, Well, then! Ahéne is exclaimed by one who recollects himself;  Navehtzemne, Alas! Woe to me!           *       *       *       *       *      CONJUNCTION.    46. The conjunctions to the extent they can, will be treated of  separately; for although the language of Indians is exact, there are  difficulties to be encountered, and from those not brought up in their  use, requiring special study.    47. The word _And_ is represented by aui, as, Nee aui nap, I and you,  and also by vai placed afterward used in this way, Nee nap vai.    48. Whether the sentence consist of one or of two parts, this  conjunction If is nowhere found, but the gerund in do or co is used;  and in this manner should it be of a single part or an individual: If  I do it well, I shall be content, hidénane éndo, or énco, nanacerátze;  when of two, thus: If I did it well, you will be content, hidéna  netzendo, or emco, nap nanacerátze: whence it may be seen that in the  first passage is put the nominative nee, having but one part, and in  the second the dative or accusative netz, since another member comes  in which is nap, you. These are other examples: If I should be well,  I will go to see you, Nee hidéna crádo, osét eme teuhdontze, which is  an expression of one proposition, for though two persons enter there  the action is single: If I shall have worked well you will pay me, Nee  hidéna pananhriuhco, nap netz ovidetze, which is of two positions, the  action being of two.    49. In the examples about to be given, it will be observed that  _That_ is never used, whether it correspond to the quod or the ut  of the Latin. Nee eme vitzán, nap hibe, I see that you are lax; Nee  aguáteran, Domincotze amo misa ea vitzaca, I know that you have not  heard mass Sunday; where vitzaca or vitzácauh is passive perfect, and  the literal rendering is, I know, on Sunday your mass was not heard.  I desire that you may live here, Nee eme iuide cáteo naquém, in which  cáteo is an active perfect participle, and the verb naquém, I desire,  ever requires this construction. The verb óqueem, I command, is  peculiar likewise in one respect: in order to say I command you that  you work, Nee eme panaúaoqueem is said; panaúaoqueem being composed of  two words, of which panauatze, I will work, is from panaúan, work, the  tze final being taken away and substituted by óqueem.    50. The equivalent of _Because_, nanévari, can be thus shown. I become  angry because you are lax, Nee zínauan, ne néuari nap híbeen: with the  particle aréde, which means because, it may be elegantly expressed,  Nap híbeen, aredene zinauan, which, word for word, is, You are lax,  for that I become angry. Here are other instances: Because I am sick  I do not work, Nee ca panauan, nanéuarine cocotzem; in another manner,  Nee cocotzem, arédene ca panauan, or Nee no cócotzihdade ca panauan,  which corresponds to this, I, because of my infirmity, do not work. I  come, because you called me, Nee eue hasi, naneuari nap netz ouíqui.  Eue, signifying hither, is used because to the Indian ear, I came  hither, is more euphonious than only I came. Nap netzoúiqui, arédene  hási, I am glad, because you come to see me, Nee nánaceran, nanéuari  nap netzeue teúhdóniueren, or otherwise, Nap netz eue teúhdóniueren  arédene nanaceran.    51. The equivalent of _Before_ is caque, the translation of which is  not yet. Before you could come I was already here, Nap caque hasdo nee  vínu iuide énitude, of which hasdo is the gerund of hásem, that part  of speech being thus used with caque, when it signifies before, and is  literally, You not arrived yet, already was I here. Another instance:  Before you can go, you will pay me: Caquena dado, netz ovidetze; also,  Before the wheat could be planted, it rained: Perilon caque étzih  dauh, duqui.    52. _After_ is rendered likewise by the gerunds with the adverb vaar,  after. After he had sinned, he was converted to God: Varúhruco vaàr,  Diosse vené are viranari, that is, having sinned afterward, etc.; and  also it may be without vaár, as, After it had rained much, the river  carried away the earth: Muic duco, bata guasta údari. Again: After the  wheat had been cut, it got wet, and was lost: Pericon are tepúnaricoua  sánhruco nasórtui.    53. _When_ may be rendered by héco, as, When you had come to see me, I  had gone for wood: Hècona netz eue teuhdòni, nee cumandóniru. Another:  When Christ had died, so much as was man died, and had not died  so much as was God: Héco múcruco Cristo, are dóremcade muqui, are  Diósemeade ca muqui; where also mucruco is gerund, and likewise may  be said, héco muqui Cristo etc. If the question be asked, When? the  accent is placed upon the last letter.    NUMERALS.    54, 55, 57. The native having counted to ten, says ten and one on it,  etc., and at twenty says one man, sei dóhme, for the reason of that  being his full number of fingers and toes: for forty he says, two  men, got dóhme, and so on to a hundred, marqui dóhme. After twenty the  count is the same as with the ten, twenty and one on it, etc. These  numerals have also their inflections:      1, sei,    once, ses,            6, vusani,      six times, vusanis,    2, godum,  twice, gos,           7, seniovusáni, seven times, seniovusánis,    3, veidum, thrice, veis,         8, gos návoi,   eight times, gos návos,    4, nauoi,  four times, návos,    9, vesmácoi,    nine times, vesmácois,    5, marqui, five times, marquis, 10, macoi,       ten times, mácois.    The word _Already_, de, is thus added:      Gósade,    Márquisade,       Gosnavosade,    Veisade,   Vusánisade,       Vesmácoisade,    Navósade,  Seniovusánisade,  Mácoisade.    ORDINALS.    56. To form these the numerals are put in the ablative with in, _tze_,  which is placed afterward as the prepositions ever are. Sétze, first;  góctze, second; véictze, third; návoctze, fourth; márquitze, fifth;  vusánitze, sixth; seniovásanitze, seventh; gosnávoctze, eighth;  vesmácoitze, ninth; mácoitze, tenth. First is also called vatzut  neréntze.    58. On the third day, is expressed, Veie queco; on the fourth day,  Navoe queco, etc.           *       *       *       *       *      THE LORD'S PRAYER.    IN SPANISH AND HEVE.        Nuestro Padre, que estás en el cielo. Tu nombre sea      grandemente creido. A nosotros venga tu reino.

So we left Stormberg in much anger and some humiliation, and jolted away  towards the open sea, where British supremacy is not yet contested by  the Boer. At Molteno we picked up a hundred volunteers--fine-looking  fellows all eager to encounter the enemy, but much surprised at the turn  events had taken. They, too, were ordered to fall back. The Boers were  advancing, and to despondent minds even the rattle of the train seemed  to urge 'Retreat, retreat, retreat.'    I do not desire to invest this wise and prudent though discouraging move  with more than its proper importance. Anything is better than to leave  small garrisons to be overwhelmed. Until the Army Corps comes, the  situation will continue to be unsatisfactory, and the ground to be  recovered afterwards will increase in extent. But with the arrival of  powerful and well-equipped forces the tide of war will surely turn.          CHAPTER IV    IN NATAL      Estcourt: November 6, 1899.    The reader may remember that we started post haste from Cape Town, and,  having the good fortune to pass along the southern frontier from De Aar  to Stormberg by the last train before the interruption of traffic, had  every hope of reaching Ladysmith while its investment was incomplete. I  had looked forward to writing an account of our voyage from East London  to Durban while on board the vessel; but the weather was so tempestuous,  and the little steamer of scarcely 100 tons burthen so buffeted by the  waves, that I lay prostrate in all the anguish of sea-sickness, and had  no thought for anything else. Moreover, we were delayed some twenty  hours by contrary winds; nor was it until we had passed St. John's that  the gale, as if repenting, veered suddenly to the south-west and added  as much to our speed as it had formerly delayed us. With the change of  the wind the violence of the waves to some degree abated, and, though  unable to then record them on paper, I had an opportunity of gaining  some impressions of the general aspect of the coasts of Pondoland and  Natal. These beautiful countries stretch down to the ocean in smooth  slopes of the richest verdure, broken only at intervals by lofty bluffs  crowned with forests. The many rivulets to which the pasture owes its  life and the land its richness glide to the shore through deep-set  creeks and chines, or plunge over the cliffs in cascades which the  strong winds scatter into clouds of spray.    These are regions of possibility, and as we drove along before our now  friendly wind I could not but speculate on the future. Here are wide  tracts of fertile soil watered by abundant rains. The temperate sun  warms the life within the soil. The cooling breeze refreshes the  inhabitant. The delicious climate stimulates the vigour of the European.  The highway of the sea awaits the produce of his labour. All Nature  smiles, and here at last is a land where white men may rule and prosper.  As yet only the indolent Kaffir enjoys its bounty, and, according to the  antiquated philosophy of Liberalism, it is to such that it should for  ever belong. But while Englishmen choke and fester in crowded cities,  while thousands of babies are born every month who are never to have a  fair chance in life, there will be those who will dream another dream of  a brave system of State-aided--almost State-compelled--emigration, a  scheme of old age pensions that shall anticipate old age, and by  preventing paupers terminate itself; a system that shall remove the  excess of the old land to provide the deficiency of the new, and shall  offer even to the most unfortunate citizen of the Empire fresh air and  open opportunity. And as I pondered on all these things, the face of the  country seemed changed. Thriving ports and townships rose up along the  shore, and, upon the hillsides, inland towers, spires, and tall chimneys  attested the wealth and industry of men. Here in front of us was New  Brighton; the long shelving ledge of rock was a seawall already made,  rows of stately buildings covered the grassy slopes; the shipping of  many nations lay in the roadstead; above the whole scene waved The Flag,  and in the foreground on the sandy beach the great-grandchildren of the  crossing-sweeper and the sandwich-man sported by the waves that beat by  the Southern Pole, or sang aloud for joy in the beauty of their home and  the pride of their race. And then with a lurch--for the motion was still  considerable--I came back from the land of dreams to reality and the  hideous fact that Natal is invaded and assailed by the Boer.    The little steamer reached Durban safely at midnight on November 4, and  we passed an impatient six hours in a sleeping town waiting for daylight  and news. Both came in their turn. The sun rose, and we learned that  Ladysmith was cut off. Still, 'As far as you can as quickly as you can'  must be the motto of the war correspondent, and seven o'clock found us  speeding inland in the extra coach of a special train carrying the  mails. The hours I passed in Durban were not without occupation. The  hospital ship 'Sumatra' lay close to our moorings, and as soon as it was  light I visited her to look for friends, and found, alas! several in a  sorry plight. All seemed to be as well as the tenderest care and the  most lavish expenditure of money could make them. All told much the same  tale--the pluck and spirit of the troops, the stubborn unpretentious  valour of the Boer, the searching musketry. Everyone predicted a  prolonged struggle.    'All these colonials tell you,' said an officer severely wounded at  Elandslaagte, 'that the Boers only want one good thrashing to satisfy  them. Don't you believe it. They mean going through with this to the  end. What about our Government?'    And the answer that all were united at home, and that Boer constancy  would be met with equal perseverance and greater resources, lighted the  pain-drawn features with a hopeful smile.    'Well, I never felt quite safe with those politicians. I can't get about  for two months' (he was shot through the thigh), 'but I hope to be in at  the death. It's our blood against theirs.'    Pietermaritzburg is sixty miles from Durban, but as the railway zigzags  up and down hill and contorts itself into curves that would horrify the  domestic engineer, the journey occupies four hours. The town looks more  like Ootacamund than any place I have seen. To those who do not know the  delightful hill station of Southern India let me explain that  Pietermaritzburg stands in a basin of smooth rolling downs, broken  frequently by forests of fir and blue gum trees. It is a sleepy,  dead-alive place. Even the fact that Colonel Knowle, the military  engineer, was busily putting it into a state of defence, digging up its  hills, piercing its walls, and encircling it with wire obstructions did  not break its apathy. The 'Times of Natal' struggled to rouse  excitement, and placarded its office with the latest telegrams from the  front, some of which had reached Pietermaritzburg _via_ London. But the  composure of the civil population is a useful factor in war, and I wish  it were within the power of my poor pen to bring home to the people of  England how excellently the colonists of Natal have deserved of the  State.    There are several points to be remembered in this connection. First, the  colonists have had many dealings with the Boers. They knew their  strength, they feared their animosity. But they have never for one  moment lost sight of their obligations as a British colony. Their  loyalty has been splendid. From the very beginning they warned the  Imperial Government that their territories would be invaded. Throughout  the course of the long negotiations they knew that if war should come,  on them would fall the first fury of the storm. Nevertheless, they  courageously supported and acclaimed the action of the Ministry. Now at  last there is war. It means a good deal to all of us, but more than to  any it comes home to the Natalian. He is invaded; his cattle have been  seized by the Boer; his towns are shelled or captured; the most powerful  force on which he relies for protection is isolated in Ladysmith; his  capital is being loopholed and entrenched; Newcastle has been abandoned,  Colenso has fallen, Estcourt is threatened; the possibility that the  whole province will be overrun stares him in the face. From the  beginning he asked for protection. From the beginning he was promised  complete protection; but scarcely a word of complaint is heard. The  townsfolk are calm and orderly, the Press dignified and sober. The men  capable of bearing arms have responded nobly. Boys of sixteen march with  men of fifty to war--to no light easy war. All the volunteers are in the  field bearing their full share of the fighting like men. Nor are the  Outlanders backward in their own quarrel. The Imperial Light Infantry is  eagerly filled. The Imperial Light Horse can find no more vacancies,  not even for those who will serve without pay.    I talked with a wounded Gordon Highlander--one of those who dashed  across the famous causeway of Dargai and breasted the still more  glorious slope of Elandslaagte.    'We had the Imperial Horse with us,' he said. 'They're the best I've  ever seen.'    The casualty lists tell the same tale. To storm the hill the regiment  dismounted less than two hundred men. They reached the top unchecked,  their Colonel, their Adjutant, Lieutenant Barnes, seven other officers,  and upwards of sixty men killed or wounded--nearly 30 per cent. Many of  this corps came from Johannesburg. After this who will dare call  Outlanders cowards? Not that it will ever matter again.    Viewed in quieter days, the patient, trustful attitude of this colony of  Natal will impress the historian. The devotion of its people to their  Sovereign and to their motherland should endear them to all good  Englishmen, and win"]]]
