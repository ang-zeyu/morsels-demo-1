[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#5)"],[1,"Alcestis aus Persien_ (Leipz. 1689) and  others.[67]    The most striking instance of the Oriental tendency is furnished by  Grimmelshausen's _Joseph_, first published probably in 1667.[68] Here we  meet the famous story of Yusuf and Zalicha as it is given in the _Quran_  or in the poems of Firdausi and Jami. The well-known episode of the  ladies cutting their hands instead of the lemons in consequence of their  confusion at the sight of Joseph's beauty is here narrated at  length.[69] In the preface the author states explicitly that he has  drawn, not only from the Bible, but from Hebrew, Arabic and Persian  writings as well.[70] That he should have made use of Arabic material is  credible enough, for Dutch Orientalists like Golius and Erpenius had  made this accessible.[71] That he had some idea of Persian poetry is  shown by his allusions to the fondness of Orientals for handsome  boys.[72] On the other hand, what he says of Zoroaster in the _Musai_  can all be found in Latin and Greek writers.[73] Here we get the  biography of Joseph's chief servant in the form of an appendix to the  novel, and the author displays all the learning which fortunately his  good taste had excluded from the story itself. Of the Iranian tradition  concerning Zoroaster's death as given in the Pahlavi writings or the  _Shah Namah_[74] Grimmelshausen knew absolutely nothing; nor can we find  the slightest evidence to substantiate his assertion that for the work  in question he drew from Persian or Arabic sources.           *       *       *       *       *    In the eighteenth century the Oriental tale was extremely popular in  France, and thence it spread to other countries. The translation of the  Thousand and One Nights by Galland (Paris, 1704-1712) and of the Persian  Tales by Petis de La Croix called into being a host of similar French  productions, which in turn found their way into German literature. The  most fruitful writer in this genre was Simon Gueulette, the author of  _Soirees Bretonnes_ (1712) and _Mille et un quart d'heures_ (1715). The  latter contains the story of a prince who is punished for his  presumption by having two snakes grow from his shoulders. To appease  them they are fed on fresh human brain.[75] Of course, we recognize at  once the story of the tyrant Zahhak familiar from Firdausi. The material  for the _Soirees_ was drawn largely from Armeno's _Peregrinaggio_, which  purports to be a translation from the Persian, although no original is  known to scholars.[76] From these _Soirees_ Voltaire took the material  for his _Zadig_.[77] In most cases, however, all that was Oriental about  such stories was the name and the costume. So popular was the Oriental  costume that Montesquieu used it for satirizing the Parisians in his  _Lettres Persanes_ (1721). Through French influence the Oriental story  came to Germany, and so we get such works as August Gottlob Meissner's  tales of _Nushirvan_, _Massoud_, _Giaffar_, _Sadi_ and others,[78] or  Klinger's _Derwisch_. Wieland used the Eastern costume in his _Schach  Lolo_ (1778) and in his politico-didactic romance of the wise  Danischmende. This fondness for an Oriental atmosphere continues even  into the nineteenth century and may be seen in such works as Tieck's  _Abdallah_ and Hauff's _Karawane_. But this brings us to the time when  India and Persia were to give up their secrets, and when the influence  of their literature begins to be a factor in the literature of Europe.

Herder's Interest in the Orient--Fourth Collection of his        Zerstreute Blaetter--His Didactic Tendency And Predilection For        Sa'di.      The epoch-making work of the English Orientalists, and above all, of the  illustrious Sir William Jones, at the end of the eighteenth century not  only laid the foundation of Sanskrit scholarship in Europe, but also  gave the first direct impulse to the Oriental movement which in the  first half of the nineteenth century manifests itself so strikingly both  in English as well as in German literature, especially in the work of  the poets. In Germany this movement came just at the time when the idea  of a universal literature had taken hold of the minds of the leading  literary men, and so it was very natural that the pioneer and prophet of  this great idea should also be the first to introduce into German poetry  the new _west-oestliche Richtung_.    Herder's theological studies turned his attention to the East at an  early age. As is well known, he always had a fervid admiration for the  Hebrew poets, but we have evidence to show, that, even before the year  1771, when Jones' _Traite sur la poesie orientale_ appeared, he had  widened the sphere of his Oriental studies and had become interested in  Sa'di.[79] Rhymed paraphrases made by him of some stories from the  _Gulistan_ date from the period 1761-1764,[80] and, as occasional  references prove, Sa'di continued to hold his attention until the  appearance, in 1792, of the fourth Collection of the _Zerstreute  Blaetter_, which contains the bulk of Herder's translation from Persian  and Sanskrit literature, and which therefore will have to occupy our  attention.[81]    Of this collection the following are of interest to us: 1 deg.. Four books  of translations, more or less free, of maxims from the _Gulistan_,  entitled _Blumen aus morgenlaendischen Dichtern gesammlet_. 2 deg..  Translations from the Sanskrit consisting of maxims from the  _Hitopadesa_ and from Bhartrhari and passages from the _Bhagavadgita_  under the name of _Gedanken einiger Bramanen_. 3 deg.. A number of versions  from Persian, Sanskrit, Hebrew and Arabic poets given in the Suphan  edition as _Vermischte Stuecke_.    The first three books of the _Blumen_ consist entirely of maxims from  the _Gulistan_, the versions of Gentius, or sometimes of Olearius, being  the basis, while the fourth book contains also poems from Rumi, Hafid  and others (some not Persian), taken mostly from Jones' well known  _Poeseos_.[82] For the _Gedanken_ our poet made use of Wilkins'  translation of the _Hitopadesa_ (1787) and of the _Bhagavadgita_ (1785),  together with the German version of Bhartrhari by Arnold from Roger's  Dutch rendering.    As Herder did not know either Sanskrit or Persian, his versions are  translations of translations, and it is not surprising if the sense of  the original is sometimes very much altered, especially when we consider  that the translations on which he depended were not always accurate.[83]  In most cases, however, the sense is fairly well preserved, sometimes  even with admirable fidelity, as in \"Lob der Gottheit\" (_Bl._ i. 1),  which is a version of passages from the introduction to the _Gulistan_.  No attention whatever is paid to the form of the originals. For the  selections from Sa'di the distich which had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#5)"],[1,"rose unbidden to my lips, I sprang  wildly across the room ... for now I had seen something else!    Attached to one of the four silken tassels which ornamented the  lamp-shade, so as almost to rest upon the cheek of the sleeping man,  was a little corymb of bloom ... the _Flower of Silence!_    Grasping the shade with my left hand I seized the flex with my right,  and as Smith sprang upright in bed, eyes wildly glaring, I wrenched  with all my might. Upward my gaze was set; and I glimpsed a yellow  hand, with long, pointed finger nails. There came a loud resounding  snap; an electric spark spat venomously from the circular opening  above the bed; and, with the cord and lamp still fast in my grip, I  went rolling across the carpet--as the other lamp became instantly  extinguished.    Dimly I perceived Smith, arrayed in pyjamas, jumping out upon the  opposite side of the bed.    \"Petrie, Petrie!\" he cried, \"where are you? what has happened?\"    A laugh, little short of hysterical, escaped me. I gathered myself up  and made for the lighted sitting-room.    \"Quick, Smith!\" I said--but I did not recognize my own voice. \"Quick--  come out of that room.\"    I crossed to the settee, and shaking in every limb, sank down upon it.  Nayland Smith, still wild-eyed, and his face a mask of bewilderment,  came out of the bedroom and stood watching me.    \"For God's sake what has happened, Petrie?\" he demanded, and began  clutching at the lobe of his left ear and looking all about the room  dazedly.    \"The Flower of Silence!\" I said; \"some one has been at work in the top  corridor.... Heaven knows when, for since we engaged these rooms we  have not been much away from them ... the same device as in the case  of poor Hale.... You would have tried to brush the thing away ...\"    A light of understanding began to dawn in my friend's eyes. He drew  himself stiffly upright, and in a loud, harsh voice uttered the words:  \"Sakya Muni\"--and again: \"Sakya Muni.\"    \"Thank God!\" I said shakily. \"I was not too late.\"    Nayland Smith, with much rattling of glass, poured out two stiff pegs  from the decanter. Then--    \"_Ssh!_what's that?\" he whispered.    He stood, tense, listening, his head cast slightly to one side.    A very faint sound of shuffling and tapping was perceptible, coming,  as I thought, from the incomplete stairway communicating with the upper  corridor.    \"The man with the limp!\" whispered Smith.    He bounded to the door and actually had one hand upon the bolt, when  he turned, and fixed his gaze upon the brass box.    \"No!\" he snapped; \"there are occasions when prudence should rule.  Neither of us must leave these rooms to-night!\"        CHAPTER V    JOHN KI'S      \"What is the meaning of Si-Fan?\" asked Detective-sergeant Fletcher.    He stood looking from the window at the prospect below; at the trees  bordering the winding embankment; at the ancient monolith which for  unnumbered ages had looked across desert sands to the Nile, and now  looked down upon another river of many mysteries. The view seemed to  absorb his attention. He spoke without turning his head.    Nayland Smith laughed shortly.    \"The Si-Fan are the natives of Eastern Tibet,\" he replied.    \"But the term has some other significance, sir?\" said the detective;  his words were more of an assertion than a query.    \"It has,\" replied my friend grimly. \"I believe it to be the name, or  perhaps the sigil, of an extensive secret society with branches  stretching out into every corner of the Orient.\"    We were silent for awhile. Inspector Weymouth, who sat in a chair near  the window, glanced appreciatively at the back of his subordinate, who  still stood looking out. Detective-sergeant Fletcher was one of  Scotland Yard's coming men. He had information of the first importance  to communicate, and Nayland Smith had delayed his departure upon an  urgent errand in order to meet him.    \"Your case to date, Mr. Smith,\" continued Fletcher, remaining with  hands locked behind him, staring from the window, \"reads something like  this, I believe: A brass box, locked, contents unknown, has come into  your possession. It stands now upon the table there. It was brought  from Tibet by a man who evidently thought that it  had something to  do with the Si-Fan. He is dead, possibly by the agency of members of  this group. No arrests have been made. You know that there are people  here in London who are anxious to regain the box. You have theories  respecting the identity of some of them, but there are practically no  facts.\"    Nayland Smith nodded his head.    \"Exactly!\" he snapped.    \"Inspector Weymouth, here,\" continued Fletcher, \"has put me in  possession of such facts as are known to him, and I believe that I  have had the good fortune to chance upon a valuable one.\"    \"You interest me, Sergeant Fletcher,\" said Smith. \"What is the nature  of this clue?\"    \"I will tell you,\" replied the other, and turned briskly upon his heel  to  face us.    He had a dark, clean-shaven face, rather sallow complexion, and  deep-set, searching eyes. There was decision in the square, cleft chin  and strong character in the cleanly chiseled features. His manner was  alert.    \"I have specialized in Chinese crime,\" he said; \"much of my time is  spent amongst our Asiatic visitors. I am fairly familiar with the  Easterns who use the port of London, and I have a number of useful  acquaintances among them.\"    Nayland Smith nodded. Beyond doubt Detective-sergeant Fletcher knew  his business.    \"To my lasting regret,\" Fletcher continued, \"I never met the late Dr.  Fu-Manchu. I understand, sir, that you believe him to have been a high  official of this dangerous society? However, I think we may get in  touch with some other notabilities; for instance, I'm told that one  of the people you're looking for has been described as 'the man with  the limp'?\"    Smith, who had been about to relight his pipe, dropped the match on  the carpet and set his foot upon it. His eyes shone like steel.    \"'The man with the limp,'\" he said, and slowly rose to his feet--\"what  do you know of the man with the limp?\"    Fletcher's face flushed slightly; his words had proved more dramatic  than he had anticipated.    \"There's a place down Shadwell way,\" he replied, \"of which, no doubt,  you  will have heard; it has no official title, but it is known to  habitues as the Joy-Shop....\"    Inspector Weymouth stood up, his burly figure towering over that of  his slighter confrere.    \"I don't think you know John Ki's, Mr. Smith,\" he said. \"We keep all  those places pretty well patrolled, and until this present business  cropped up, John's establishment had never given us any trouble.\"    \"What is this Joy-Shop?\" I asked.    \"A resort of shady characters, mostly Asiatics,\" replied Weymouth.  \"It's a gambling-house, an unlicensed drinking-shop, and even worse--  but it's more use to us open than it would be shut.\"    \"It is one of my regular jobs to keep an eye on the visitors to the  Joy-Shop,\" continued Fletcher. \"I have many acquaintances who use the  place. Needless to add, they don't know my real business! Well,  lately several of them have asked me if I know who the man is that  hobbles about the place with two sticks. Everybody seems to have  heard him, but no one has seen him.\"    Nayland Smith began to pace the floor restlessly.    \"I have heard him myself,\" added Fletcher, \"but never managed to get  so much as a glimpse of him.  When I learnt about this Si-Fan mystery,  I realized that he might very possibly be the man for whom you're  looking--and a golden opportunity has cropped up for you to visit the  Joy-Shop, and, if our luck remains in, to get a peep behind the scenes.\"    \"I am all attention,\" snapped Smith.    \"A woman called Zarmi has recently put in an appearance at the  Joy-Shop. Roughly speaking, she turned up at about the same time as  the unseen man with the limp....\"    Nayland Smith's eyes were blazing with suppressed excitement; he was  pacing quickly up and down the floor, tugging at the lobe of his left  ear.    \"She is--different in some way from any other woman I have ever seen  in the place. She's a Eurasian and good-looking, after a tigerish  fashion. I have done my best\"--he smiled slightly--\"to get in her good  books, and up to a point I've succeeded. I was there last night, and  Zarmi asked me if I knew what she called a 'strong feller.'    \"'These,' she informed me, contemptuously referring to the rest of the  company, 'are poor weak Johnnies!'    \"I had nothing definite in view at the time, for I had not then heard  about your return to London, but I thought it might lead to something  anyway, so I promised to bring a friend along to-night. I don't know  what we're wanted to do, but ...\"    \"Count on me!\" snapped Smith. \"I will leave all details to you and to  Weymouth, and I will be at New Scotland Yard this evening in time to  adopt a suitable disguise. Petrie\"--he turned impetuously to me--\"I  fear I shall have to go without you; but I shall be in safe company,  as you see, and doubtless Weymouth can find you a part in his portion  of the evening's program.\"    He glanced at his watch.    \"Ah! I must be off. If you will oblige me, Petrie, by putting the  brass box into my smaller portmanteau, whilst I slip my coat on,  perhaps Weymouth, on his way out, will be good enough to order a taxi.  I shall venture to breathe again once our unpleasant charge is safely  deposited in the bank vaults!\"      CHAPTER VI    THE SI-FAN MOVE      A slight drizzling rain was falling as Smith entered the cab which  the hall-porter had summoned. The brown bag in his hand contained the  brass box which actually was responsible for our presence in London.  The last glimpse I had of him through the glass of the closed window  showed him striking a match to light his pipe--which he rarely allowed  to grow cool.    Oppressed with an unaccountable weariness of spirit, I stood within  the lobby"]]]
