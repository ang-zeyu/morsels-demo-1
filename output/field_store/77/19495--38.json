Another night,  they turned out again, and had a chimney-cowl off.  Another night,  they cut a sobbing and gulping water-pipe away.  Another night,  they found out something else.  On several occasions, they both, in  the coolest manner, simultaneously dropped out of their respective  bedroom windows, hand over hand by their counterpanes, to  \"overhaul\" something mysterious in the garden.    The engagement among us was faithfully kept, and nobody revealed  anything.  All we knew was, if any one's room were haunted, no one  looked the worse for it.        The foregoing story is particularly interesting as illustrating the  leaning of Dickens's mind toward the spiritualistic and mystical  fancies current in his time, and the counterbalance of his common  sense and fun.    \"He probably never made up his own mind,\" Mr. Andrew Lang declares  in a discussion of this Haunted House story.  Mr. Lang says he once  took part in a similar quest, and \"can recognize the accuracy of  most of Dickens's remarks.  Indeed, even to persons not on the  level of the Odd Girl in education, the temptation to produce  'phenomena' for fun is all but overwhelming.  That people  communicate hallucinations to each other 'in some diseased way  without words,' is a modern theory perhaps first formulated here by  Dickens.\"    \"The Signal Man's Story,\" which follows, is likewise, Mr. Lang  believes, \"probably based on some real story of the kind, some  anecdote of premonitions.  There are scores in the records of the  Society for Psychical Research.\"--The Editor.        NO. 1 BRANCH LINE: THE SIGNAL-MAN      \"Halloa!  Below there!\"    When he heard a voice thus calling to him, he was standing at the  door of his box, with a flag in his hand, furled round its short  pole.  One would have thought, considering the nature of the  ground, that he could not have doubted from what quarter the voice  came; but instead of looking up to where I stood on the top of the  steep cutting nearly over his head, he turned himself about, and  looked down the Line.  There was something remarkable in his manner  of doing so, though I could not have said for my life what.  But I  know it was remarkable enough to attract my notice, even though his  figure was foreshortened and shadowed, down in the deep trench, and  mine was high above him, so steeped in the glow of an angry sunset,  that I had shaded my eyes with my hand before I saw him at all.    \"Halloa!  Below!\"    From looking down the Line, he turned himself about again, and,  raising his eyes, saw my figure high above him.    \"Is there any path by which I can come down and speak to you?\"    He looked up at me without replying, and I looked down at him  without pressing him too soon with a repetition of my idle  question.  Just then there came a vague vibration in the earth and  air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an oncoming  rush that caused me to start back, as though it had a force to draw  me down.  When such vapor as rose to my height from this rapid  train had passed me, and was skimming away over the landscape, I  looked down again, and saw him refurling the flag he had shown  while the train went by.    I repeated my inquiry.  After a pause, during which he seemed to  regard me with fixed attention, he motioned with his rolled-up flag  towards a point on my level, some two or three hundred yards  distant.  I called down to him, \"All right!\" and made for that  point.  There, by dint of looking closely about me, I found a rough  zigzag descending path notched out, which I followed.    The cutting was extremely deep, and unusually precipitate.  It was  made through a clammy stone, that became oozier and wetter as I  went down.  For these reasons, I found the way long enough to give  me time to recall a singular air of reluctance or compulsion with  which he had pointed out the path.    When I came down low enough upon the zigzag descent to see him  again, I saw that he was standing between the rails on the way by  which the train had lately passed, in an attitude as if he were  waiting for me to appear.  He had his left hand at his chin, and  that left elbow rested on his right hand, crossed over his breast.  His attitude was one of such expectation and watchfulness that I  stopped a moment, wondering at it.    I resumed my downward way, and stepping out upon the level of the  railroad, and drawing nearer to him, saw that he was a dark, sallow  man, with a dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows.  His post was in  as solitary and dismal a place as ever I saw.  On either side, a  dripping-wet wall of jagged stone, excluding all view but a strip  of sky; the perspective one way only a crooked prolongation of this  great dungeon; the shorter perspective in the other direction  terminating in a gloomy red light, and the gloomier entrance to a  black tunnel, in whose massive architecture there was a barbarous,  depressing, and forbidding air.  So little sunlight ever found its  way to this spot, that it had an earthy, deadly smell; and so much  cold wind rushed through it, that it struck chill to me, as if I  had left the natural world.    Before he stirred, I was near enough to him to have touched him.  Not even then removing his eyes from mine, he stepped back one  step, and lifted his hand.    This was a lonesome post to occupy (I said), and it had riveted my  attention when I looked down from up yonder.  A visitor was a  rarity, I should suppose; not an unwelcome rarity, I hoped?  In me,  he merely saw a man who had been shut up within narrow limits all  his life, and who, being at last set free, had a newly-awakened  interest in these great works.  To such purpose I spoke to him; but  I am far from sure of the terms I used; for, besides that I am not  happy in opening any conversation, there was something in the man  that daunted me.    He directed a most curious look towards the red light near the  tunnel's mouth, and looked all about it, as if something were  missing from it, and then looked it me.    That light was part of his charge?  Was it not?    He answered in a low voice,--\"Don't you know it is?\"    The monstrous thought came into my mind, as I perused the fixed  eyes and the saturnine face, that this was a spirit, not a man.  I  have speculated since, whether there may have been infection in his  mind.    In my turn, I stepped back.  But in making the action, I detected  in his eyes some latent fear of me.  This put the monstrous thought  to flight.    \"You look at me,\" I said, forcing a smile, \"as if you had a dread  of me.\"    \"I was doubtful,\" he returned, \"whether I had seen you before.\"    \"Where?\"    He pointed to the red light he had looked at.    \"There?\" I said.    Intently watchful of me, he replied (but without sound), \"Yes.\"    \"My good fellow, what should I do there?  However, be that as it  may, I never was there, you may swear.\"    \"I think I may,\" he rejoined.  \"Yes; I am sure I may.\"    His manner cleared, like my own.  He replied to my remarks with  readiness, and in well-chosen words.  Had he much to do there?  Yes; that was to say, he had enough responsibility to bear; but  exactness and watchfulness were what was required of him, and of  actual work--manual labor--he had next to none.  To change that  signal, to trim those lights, and to turn this iron handle now and  then, was all he had to do under that head.  Regarding those many  long and lonely hours of which I seemed to make so much, he could  only say that the routine of his life had shaped itself into that  form, and he had grown used to it.  He had taught himself a  language down here,--if only to know it by sight, and to have  formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation, could be called  learning it.  He had also worked at fractions and decimals, and  tried a little algebra; but he was, and had been as a boy, a poor  hand at figures.  Was it necessary for him when on duty always to  remain in that channel of damp air, and could he never rise into  the sunshine from between those high stone walls?  Why, that  depended upon times and circumstances.  Under some conditions there  would be less upon the Line than under others, and the same held  good as to certain hours of the day and night.  In bright weather,  he did choose occasions for getting a little above these lower  shadows; but, being at all times liable to be called by his  electric bell, and at such times listening for it with redoubled  anxiety, the relief was less than I would suppose.    He took me into his box, where there was a fire, a desk for an  official book in which he had to make certain entries, a  telegraphic instrument with its dial, face, and needles, and the  little bell of which he had spoken.  On my trusting that he would  excuse the remark that he had been well educated, and (I hoped I  might say without offence) perhaps educated above that station, he  observed that instances of slight incongruity in such wise would  rarely be found wanting among large bodies of men; that he had  heard it was so in workhouses, in the police force, even in that  last desperate resource, the army; and that he knew it was so, more  or less, in any great railway staff.  He had been, when young (if I  could believe it, sitting in that hut,--he scarcely could), a  student of natural philosophy, and had attended lectures; but he  had run wild, misused his opportunities, gone down, and never risen  again.  He had no complaint to offer about that.  He had made his  bed, and he lay upon it.  It was far too late to make another.

Dismounting  near by, they charged the enemy  lance in hand, driving him from  his trenches. Following up their success,  they then forced their way into the village, smashing in doors and windows  and  storming house  after  house  in spite  of  fierce resistance  until,  assisted by  other troops, they forced  the enemy out, capturing  guns and  many prisoners.

The  royal  house  of  Bavaria  has  apparently followed suit.  More recently the Kaiser expressed  a wish that  the  British  might meet  the  Bavarians  \"just  once\"  and his  wish  was  gratified. In depicting a Bavarian cavalry fight with French dragoons, the  Bavarian  artist  naturally  represents  the  enemy  as  going  down  like  nine-pins. Prince Heinrich, who figures in the drawing, is the only son of  the  late  Prince  Francis  Joseph  of Bavaria,  first  cousin  of  Prince  Rupprecht, the Bavarian Crown Prince,  who recently exhorted his troops to  conquer  \"our  most hated  foe.\"  He  also  highly extolled  the  Bavarian  cavalry, who,  he said,  have fought \"with  the greatest  fearlessness and  extraordinary dash.\"          __________________________________________________________________________  30--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

After the surrender of  the garrison a number  of German  soldiers are  said to have escaped  in native boats, but  were recaptured.  The defences  were under naval  control. Tsing-tau was  strongly fortified  and had about 600 Krupp guns  of various calibre. The photographs show men  of  the Third  Sea  Battalion.

The Germans  had made  great efforts to  repair their  batteries, but the shell-fire from the  Japanese guns was too heavy. After  the central  fort had  fallen the  Japanese captured at  the point  of the  bayonet  other  forts  and  the strong  field-works  connecting  them.  It  was  stated that  some 2300  German  prisoners were  taken when  Tsing-tau  surrendered. The German  garrison, it is said, included  four companies of  seaman gunners, an equal force of Marines, some cavalry and field gunners,  and a  company of sappers. Probably  the garrison increased after  the war  began,  as Germans  from  all parts  of China  gathered  at Tsing-tau  for  protection.          __________________________________________________________________________  32--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

On the other hand, several  have been destroyed:  the number has been variously estimated  from two to  six.  One,  said  to  be  the  \"LZ10,\" was  brought  down  in  October  at  Grandvilliers, ten miles from Belfort. Our photographs show: (1) debris of  the shattered  framework; and (2)  wreckage of the cars.  Another Zeppelin  was destroyed in October by the fire of Russian batteries near Warsaw, and  its broken  remains were taken  to Petrograd  to be examined.  The British  air-raid on Duesseldorf also accounted for one or possibly two."]]]
