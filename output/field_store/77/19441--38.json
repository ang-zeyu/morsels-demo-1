Reeds grow there luxuriantly in enormous beds, and reach sometimes  a height of from thirteen to sixteen feet; banks of black and putrid mud  emerge amidst the green growth, and give off deadly emanations. Winter  is scarcely felt here: snow is unknown, hoar-frost is rarely seen,  but sometimes in the morning a thin film of ice covers the marshes, to  disappear under the first rays of the sun.*         * Loftus attributes the lowering of the temperature during       the winter to the wind blowing over a soil impregnated with       saltpetre. \"We were,\" he says, \"in a kind of immense       freezing chamber.\"    [Illustration: 027.jpg THE MARSHES ABOUT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE KERKHA  AND TIGRIS.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by J. Dieulafoy.  For six weeks in November and December there is much rain: after this  period there are only occasional showers, occurring at longer and longer  intervals until May, when they entirely cease, and the summer sets in,  to last until the following November. There are almost six continuous  months of depressing and moist heat, which overcomes both men and  animals and makes them incapable of any constant effort.* Sometimes  a south or east wind suddenly arises, and bearing with it across the  fields and canals whirlwinds of sand, burns up in its passage the little  verdure which the sun had spared. Swarms of locusts follow in its train,  and complete the work of devastation. A sound as of distant rain is at  first heard, increasing in intensity as the creatures approach. Soon  their thickly concentrated battalions fill the heavens on all sides,  flying with slow and uniform motion at a great height. They at length  alight, cover everything, devour everything, and, propagating their  species, die within a few days: nothing, not a blade of vegetation,  remains on the region where they alighted.         * Loftus says that he himself had witnessed in the       neighbourhood of Bagdad during the daytime birds perched on       the palm trees in an exhausted condition, and panting with       open beaks. The inhabitants of Bagdad during the summer pass       their nights on the housetops, and the hours of day in       passages within, expressly constructed to protect them from       the heat.    Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the country was not lacking in  resources. The soil was almost as fertile as the loam of Egypt, and,  like the latter, rewarded a hundredfold the labour of the inhabitants.*  Among the wild herbage which spreads over the country in the spring,  and clothes it for a brief season with flowers, it was found that some  plants, with a little culture, could be rendered useful to men and  beasts. There were ten or twelve different species of pulse to choose  from--beans, 'lentils, chick-peas, vetches, kidney beans, onions,  cucumbers, egg-plants, \"gombo,\" and pumpkins. From the seed of the  sesame an oil was expressed which served for food, while the castor-oil  plant furnished that required for lighting. The safflower and henna  supplied the women with dyes for the stuffs which they manufactured from  hemp and flax. Aquatic plants were more numerous than on the banks  of the Nile, but they did not occupy such an important place among  food-stuffs. The \"lily bread\" of the Pharaohs would have seemed meagre  fare to people accustomed from early times to wheaten bread. Wheat and  barley are considered to be indigenous on the plains of the Euphrates;  it was supposed to be here that they were first cultivated in Western  Asia, and that they spread from hence to Syria, Egypt, and the whole  of Europe.** \"The soil there is so favourable to the growth of cereals,  that it yields usually two hundredfold, and in places of exceptional  fertility three hundredfold. The leaves of the wheat and barley have a  width of four digits. As for the millet and sesame, which in altitude  are as great as trees, I will not state their height, although I know  it from experience, being convinced that those who have not lived in  Babylonia would regard my statement with incredulity.\" Herodotus in his  enthusiasm exaggerated the matter, or perhaps, as a general rule, he  selected as examples the exceptional instances which had been mentioned  to him: at present wheat and barley give a yield to the husbandman of  some thirty or forty fold.         * Olivier, who was a physician and naturalist, and had       visited Egypt as well as Mesopotamia, thought that Babylonia       was somewhat less fertile than Egypt. Loftus, who was       neither, and had not visited Egypt, declares, on the       contrary, that the banks of the Euphrates are no less       productive than those of the Nile.         ** Native traditions collected by Berossus confirm this, and       the testimony of Olivier is usually cited as falling in with       that of the Chaldaean writer. Olivier is considered, indeed,       to have discovered wild cereals in Mesopotamia. Pie only       says, however, that on the banks of the Euphrates above Anah       he had met with \"wheat, barley, and spelt in a kind of       ravine;\" from the context it clearly follows that these were       plants which had reverted to a wild state--instances of       which have been observed several times in Mesopotamia. A. de       Oandolle admitted the Mesopotamian origin of the various       species of wheat and barley.    [Illustration: 030.jpg THE GATHERING OF THE SPATHES OF THE MALE PALM  TREE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a cylinder in the Museum at the       Hague. The original measures almost an inch in height.    \"The date palm meets all the other needs of the population; they make  from it a kind of bread, wine, vinegar, honey, cakes, and numerous kinds  of stuffs; the smiths use the stones of its fruit for charcoal; these  same stones, broken and macerated, are given as a fattening food to  cattle and sheep.\" Such a useful tree was tended with a loving care,  the vicissitudes in its growth were observed, and its reproduction was  facilitated by the process of shaking the flowers of the male palm over  those of the female: the gods themselves had taught this artifice to  men, and they were frequently represented with a bunch of flowers in  their right hand, in the attitude assumed by a peasant in fertilizing  a palm tree. Fruit trees were everywhere mingled with ornamental  trees--the fig, apple, almond, walnut, apricot, pistachio, vine, with  the plane tree, cypress, tamarisk, and acacia; in the prosperous period  of the country the plain of the Euphrates was a great orchard which  extended uninterruptedly from the plateau of Mesopotamia to the shores  of the Persian Gulf.    The flora would not have been so abundant if the fauna had been  sufficient for the supply of a large population. A considerable  proportion of the tribes on the Lower Euphrates lived for a long time  on fish only. They consumed them either fresh, salted, or smoked: they  dried them in the sun, crushed them in a mortar, strained the pulp  through linen, and worked it up into a kind of bread or into cakes. The  barbel and carp attained a great size in these sluggish waters, and if  the Chalaeans, like the Arabs who have succeeded them in these regions,  clearly preferred these fish above others, they did not despise at the  same time such less delicate species as the eel, murena, silurus, and  even that singular gurnard whose habits are an object of wonder to our  naturalists. This fish spends its existence usually in the water, but  a life in the open air has no terrors for it: it leaps out on the bank,  climbs trees without much difficulty, finds a congenial habitat on the  banks of mud exposed by the falling tide, and basks there in the sun,  prepared to vanish in the ooze in the twinkling of an eye if some  approaching bird should catch sight of it. Pelicans, herons, cranes,  storks, cormorants, hundreds of varieties of seagulls, ducks, swans,  wild geese, secure in the possession of an inexhaustible supply of food,  sport and prosper among the reeds. The ostrich, greater bustard, the  common and red-legged partridge and quail, find their habitat on the  borders of the desert; while the thrush, blackbird, ortolan, pigeon,  and turtle-dove abound on every side, in spite of daily onslaughts from  eagles, hawks, and other birds of prey.

[Illustration: 033.jpg THE HEAVILY MANED LION WOUNDED BY AN ARROW AND  VOMITING BLOOD.]    Snakes are found here and there, but they are for the most part of  innocuous species: three poisonous varieties only are known, and their  bite does not produce such terrible consequences as that of the horned  viper or Egyptian uraeus. There are two kinds of lion--one without mane,  and the other hooded, with a heavy mass of black and tangled hair: the  proper signification of the old Chaldaean name was \"the great 'dog,\" and  they have, indeed, a greater resemblance to large dogs than to the  red lions of Africa.* They fly at the approach of man; they betake  themselves in the daytime to retreats among the marshes or in the  thickets which border the rivers, sallying forth at night, like  the jackal, to scour the country. Driven to bay, they turn upon the  assailant and fight desperately. The Chaldaean kings, like the Pharaohs,  did not shrink from entering into a close conflict with them,  and boasted of having rendered a service to their subjects by the  destruction of many of these beasts.    * The Sumerian name of the lion is ur-malch \"the great dog.\" The best  description of the first-mentioned species is still that of Olivier, who  saw in the house oL the Pasha of Bagdad five of them in captivity; cf.  Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, p. 487.

Babylon was,  however, at the outset, but a poor town, situated on both banks of the  Euphrates, in a low-lying, flat district, intersected by canals and  liable at times to become marshy. The river at this point runs almost  directly north and south, between two banks of black mud, the base of  which it is perpetually undermining. As long as the city existed, the  vertical thrust of the public buildings and houses kept the river within  bounds, and even since it was finally abandoned, the masses of _debris_  have almost everywhere had the effect of resisting its encroachment;  towards the north, however, the line of its ancient quays has given  way and sunk beneath the waters, while the stream, turning its course  westwards, has transferred to the eastern bank the gardens and mounds  originally on the opposite side. E-sagilla, the temple of the lofty  summit, the sanctuary of Merodach, probably occupied the vacant space in  the depression between the Babil and the hill of the Kasr.*         * The temple of Merodach, called by the Greeks the temple of       Belos, has been placed on the site called Babil by the two       Rawlinsons; and by Oppert; Hormuzd Rassam and Fr. Delitzsch       locate it between the hill of Junjuma and the Kasr, and       considers Babil to be a palace of Nebuchadrezzar.    In early times it must have presented much the same appearance as  the sanctuaries of Central Chaldaea: a mound of crude brick formed the  substructure of the dwellings of the priests and the household of the  god, of the shops for the offerings and for provisions, of the treasury,  and of the apartments for purification or for sacrifice, while the whole  was surmounted by a ziggurat. On other neighbouring platforms rose the  royal palace and the temples of lesser divinities,* elevated above the  crowd of private habitations.         * As, for instance, the temple E-temenanki on the actual       hill of Amran-ibn-Ali, the temple of Shamash, and others,       which there will be occasion to mention later on in dealing       with the second Chaldaean empire.    [Illustration: 032.jpg THE KASK SEEN FROM THE SOUTH]         Drawn by Boudier, from the engraving by Thomas in Perrot-       Chipiez.    The houses of the people were closely built around these stately piles,  on either side of narrow lanes. A massive wall surrounded the whole,  shutting out the view on all sides; it even ran along the bank of the  Euphrates, for fear of a surprise from that quarter, and excluded the  inhabitants from the sight of their own river. On the right bank rose  a suburb, which was promptly fortified and enlarged, so as to become a  second Babylon, almost equalling the first in extent and population.    [Illustration: 033.jpg THE TELL OF BORSIPPA, THE PRESENT BIRS-NIMRUD]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after the plate published in       Ohesney.    Beyond this, on the outskirts, extended gardens and fields, finding at  length their limit at the territorial boundaries of two other towns,  Kutha and Borsippa, whose black outlines are visible to the east and  south-west respectively, standing isolated above the plain. Sippara on  the north, Nippur on the south, and the mysterious Agade, completed the  circle of sovereign states which so closely hemmed in the city of Bel.  We may surmise with all probability that the history of Babylon in early  times resembled in the main that of the Egyptian Thebes. It was a small  seigneury in the hands of petty princes ceaselessly at war with petty  neighbours: bloody struggles, with alternating successes and reverses,  were carried on for centuries with no decisive results, until the day  came when some more energetic or fortunate dynasty at length crushed its  rivals, and united under one rule first all the kingdoms of Northern and  finally those of Southern Chaldaea.    The lords of Babylon had, ordinarily, a twofold function, religious  and military, the priest at first taking precedence of the soldier, but  gradually yielding to the latter as the town increased in power.  They were merely the priestly representatives or administrators of  Babel--_shakannaku Babili_--and their authority was not considered  legitimate until officially confirmed by the god. Each ruler was obliged  to go in state to the temple of Bel Merodach within a year of his  accession: there he had to take the hands of the divine statue, just  as a vassal would do homage to his liege, and those only of the native  sovereigns or the foreign conquerors could legally call themselves Kings  of Babylon--_sharru Babili_--who had not only performed this rite, but  renewed it annually.*         * The meaning of the ceremony in which the kings of Babylon       \"took the hands of Bel\" has been given by Winckler; Tiele       compares it very aptly with the rite performed by the       Egyptian kings--at Heliopolis, for example, when they       entered alone the sanctuary of Ra, and there contemplated       the god face to face. The rite was probably repeated       annually, at the time of the Zakmuku, that is, the New Year       festival.    Sargon the Elder had lived in Babylon, and had built himself a palace  there: hence the tradition of later times attributed to this city the  glory of having been the capital of the great empire founded by the  Akkadian dynasties. The actual sway of Babylon, though arrested to the  south by the petty states of Lower Chaldaea, had not encountered to the  north or north-west any enemy to menace seriously its progress in that  semi-fabulous period of its history. The vast plain extending between  the Euphrates and the Tigris is as it were a continuation of the  Arabian desert, and is composed of a grey, or in parts a whitish, soil  impregnated with selenite and common salt, and irregularly superimposed  upon a bed of gypsum, from which asphalt oozes up here and there,  forming slimy pits. Frost is of rare occurrence in winter, and rain is  infrequent at any season; the sun soon burns up the scanty herbage  which the spring showers have encouraged, but fleshy plants successfully  resist its heat, such as the common salsola, the salsola soda, the  pallasia, a small mimosa, and a species of very fragrant wormwood,  forming together a vari-coloured vegetation which gives shelter to  the ostrich and the wild ass, and affords the flocks of the nomads a  grateful pasturage when the autumn has set in. The Euphrates bounds  these solitudes, but without watering them. The river flows, as far as  the eye can see, between two ranges of rock or bare hills, at the foot  of which a narrow strip of alluvial soil supports rows of date-palms  intermingled here and there with poplars, sumachs, and willows. Wherever  there is a break in the two cliffs, or where they recede from the river,  a series of shadufs takes possession of the bank, and every inch of the  soil is brought under cultivation. The aspect of the country remains  unchanged as far as the embouchure of the Khabur; but there a black  alluvial soil replaces the saliferous clay, and if only the water were  to remain on the land in sufficient quantity, the country would be  unrivalled in the world for the abundance and variety of its crops.    [Illustration: 036.jpg THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES AT ZULEIBEH]         Drawn by Boudier, from the plate in Chesney.    The fields, which are regularly sown in the neighbourhood of the small  towns, yield magnificent harvests of wheat and barley: while in the  prairie-land beyond the cultivated ground the grass grows so high that  it comes up to the horses' girths. In some places the meadows are so  covered with varieties of flowers, growing in dense masses, that the  effect produced is that of a variegated carpet; dogs sent in among them  in search of game, emerge covered with red, blue, and yellow pollen.  This fragrant prairie-land is the delight of bees, which produce  excellent and abundant honey, while the vine and olive find there a  congenial soil. The population was unequally distributed in this region.  Some half-savage tribes were accustomed to wander over the plain,  dwelling in tents, and supporting life by the chase and by the rearing  of cattle; but the bulk of the inhabitants were concentrated around the  affluents of the Euphrates and Tigris, or at the foot of the northern  mountains wherever springs could be found, as in Assur, Singar, Nisibis,  Tilli,* Kharranu, and in all the small fortified towns and nameless  townlets whose ruins are scattered over the tract of country between the  Khabur and the Balikh. Kharranu, or Harran, stood, like an advance guard  of Chaldaean civilization, near the frontiers of Syria and Asia Minor.**  To the north it commanded the passes which opened on to the basins of  the Upper Euphrates and Tigris; it protected the roads leading to the  east and south-east in the direction of the table-land of Iran and the  Persian Gulf, and it was the key to the route by which the commerce of  Babylon reached the countries lying around the Mediterranean. We have no  means of knowing what affinities as regards origin or race connected  it with Uru, but the same moon-god presided over the destinies of both  towns, and the Sin of Harran enjoyed in very early times a renown nearly  equal to that of his namesake.         * Tilli, the only one of these towns mentioned with any       certainty in the inscriptions of the first Chaldaean empire,       is the Tela of classical authors, and probably "]]]
