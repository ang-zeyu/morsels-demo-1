From each of the seven columns that adorned  this court hung festoons of garlands: the centre, supplying the place of  a garden, bloomed with the rarest flowers placed in vases of white  marble, that were supported on pedestals.  At the left hand of this  small garden was a diminutive fane, resembling one of those small  chapels placed at the side of roads in Catholic countries, and dedicated  to the Penates; before it stood a bronzed tripod: to the left of the  colonnade were two small cubicula, or bedrooms; to the right was the  triclinium, in which the guests were now assembled.    This room is usually termed by the antiquaries of Naples 'The Chamber of  Leda'; and in the beautiful work of Sir William Gell, the reader will  find an engraving from that most delicate and graceful painting of Leda  presenting her newborn to her husband, from which the room derives its  name. This charming apartment opened upon the fragrant garden.  Round  the table of citrean wood, highly polished and delicately wrought with  silver arabesques, were placed the three couches, which were yet more  common at Pompeii than the semicircular seat that had grown lately into  fashion at Rome: and on these couches of bronze, studded with richer  metals, were laid thick quiltings covered with elaborate broidery, and  yielding luxuriously to the pressure.    'Well, I must own,' said the aedile Pansa, 'that your house, though  scarcely larger than a case for one's fibulae, is a gem of its kind.  How beautifully painted is that parting of Achilles and Briseis!--what a  style!--what heads!--what a-hem!'    'Praise from Pansa is indeed valuable on such subjects,' said Clodius,  gravely.  'Why, the paintings on his walls!--Ah! there is, indeed, the  hand of a Zeuxis!'    'You flatter me, my Clodius; indeed you do,' quoth the aedile, who was  celebrated through Pompeii for having the worst paintings in the world;  for he was patriotic, and patronized none but Pompeians.  'You flatter  me; but there is something pretty--AEdepol, yes--in the colors, to say  nothing of the design--and then for the kitchen, my friends--ah! that  was all my fancy.'    'What is the design?' said Glaucus.  'I have not yet seen your kitchen,  though I have often witnessed the excellence of its cheer.'    'A cook, my Athenian--a cook sacrificing the trophies of his skill on  the altar of Vesta, with a beautiful muraena (taken from the life) on a  spit at a distance--there is some invention there!'    At that instant the slaves appeared, bearing a tray covered with the  first preparative initia of the feast.  Amidst delicious figs, fresh  herbs strewed with snow, anchovies, and eggs, were ranged small cups of  diluted wine sparingly mixed with honey.  As these were placed on the  table, young slaves bore round to each of the five guests (for there  were no more) the silver basin of perfumed water, and napkins edged with  a purple fringe.  But the aedile ostentatiously drew forth his own  napkin, which was not, indeed, of so fine a linen, but in which the  fringe was twice as broad, and wiped his hands with the parade of a man  who felt he was calling for admiration.    'A splendid nappa that of yours,' said Clodius; 'why, the fringe is as  broad as a girdle!'    'A trifle, my Clodius: a trifle!  They tell me this stripe is the latest  fashion at Rome; but Glaucus attends to these things more than I.'    'Be propitious, O Bacchus!' said Glaucus, inclining reverentially to a  beautiful image of the god placed in the centre of the table, at the  corners of which stood the Lares and the salt-holders.  The guests  followed the prayer, and then, sprinkling the wine on the table, they  performed the wonted libation.    This over, the convivialists reclined themselves on the couches, and the  business of the hour commenced.    'May this cup be my last!' said the young Sallust, as the table, cleared  of its first stimulants, was now loaded with the substantial part of the  entertainment, and the ministering slave poured forth to him a brimming  cyathus--'May this cup be my last, but it is the best wine I have drunk  at Pompeii!'    'Bring hither the amphora,' said Glaucus, 'and read its date and its  character.'    The slave hastened to inform the party that the scroll fastened to the  cork betokened its birth from Chios, and its age a ripe fifty years.    'How deliciously the snow has cooled it!' said Pansa.  'It is just  enough.'    'It is like the experience of a man who has cooled his pleasures  sufficiently to give them a double zest,' exclaimed Sallust.    'It is like a woman's \"No\",' added Glaucus: 'it cools, but to inflame  the more.'    'When is our next wild-beast fight?' said Clodius to Pansa.    'It stands fixed for the ninth ide of August,' answered Pansa: 'on the  day after the Vulcanalia--we have a most lovely young lion for the  occasion.'    'Whom shall we get for him to eat?' asked Clodius.  'Alas! there is a  great scarcity of criminals.  You must positively find some innocent or  other to condemn to the lion, Pansa!'    'Indeed I have thought very seriously about it of late,' replied the  aedile, gravely.  'It was a most infamous law that which forbade us to  send our own slaves to the wild beasts.  Not to let us do what we like  with our own, that's what I call an infringement on property itself.'    'Not so in the good old days of the Republic,' sighed Sallust.    'And then this pretended mercy to the slaves is such a disappointment to  the poor people.  How they do love to see a good tough battle between a  man and a lion; and all this innocent pleasure they may lose (if the  gods don't send us a good criminal soon) from this cursed law!'    'What can be worse policy,' said Clodius, sententiously, 'than to  interfere with the manly amusements of the people?'    'Well thank Jupiter and the Fates! we have no Nero at present,' said  Sallust.    'He was, indeed, a tyrant; he shut up our amphitheatre for ten years.'    'I wonder it did not create a rebellion,' said Sallust.    'It very nearly did,' returned Pansa, with his mouth full of wild boar.    Here the conversation was interrupted for a moment by a flourish of  flutes, and two slaves entered with a single dish.    'Ah, what delicacy hast thou in store for us now, my Glaucus?' cried the  young Sallust, with sparkling eyes.    Sallust was only twenty-four, but he had no pleasure in life like  eating--perhaps he had exhausted all the others: yet had he some talent,  and an excellent heart--as far as it went.    'I know its face, by Pollux!' cried Pansa.  'It is an Ambracian Kid.  Ho  (snapping his fingers, a usual signal to the slaves) we must prepare a  new libation in honour to the new-comer.'    'I had hoped said Glaucus,' in a melancholy tone, 'to have procured you  some oysters from Britain; but the winds that were so cruel to Caesar  have forbid us the oysters.'    'Are they in truth so delicious?' asked Lepidus, loosening to a yet more  luxurious ease his ungirdled tunic.    'Why, in truth, I suspect it is the distance that gives the flavor; they  want the richness of the Brundusium oyster.  But, at Rome, no supper is  complete without them.'    'The poor Britons!  There is some good in them after all,' said Sallust.  'They produce an oyster.'    'I wish they would produce us a gladiator,' said the aedile, whose  provident mind was musing over the wants of the amphitheatre.    'By Pallas!' cried Glaucus, as his favorite slave crowned his streaming  locks with a new chaplet, 'I love these wild spectacles well enough when  beast fights beast; but when a man, one with bones and blood like ours,  is coldly put on the arena, and torn limb from limb, the interest is too  horrid: I sicken--I gasp for breath--I long to rush and defend him.  The  yells of the populace seem to me more dire than the voices of the Furies  chasing Orestes.  I rejoice that there is so little chance of that  bloody exhibition for our next show!'    The aedile shrugged his shoulders.  The young Sallust, who was thought  the best-natured man in Pompeii, stared in surprise.  The graceful  Lepidus, who rarely spoke for fear of disturbing his features,  ejaculated 'Hercle!' The parasite Clodius muttered 'AEdepol!' and the  sixth banqueter, who was the umbra of Clodius, and whose duty it was to  echo his richer friend, when he could not praise him--the parasite of a  parasite--muttered also 'AEdepol!'    'Well, you Italians are used to these spectacles; we Greeks are more  merciful.  Ah, shade of Pindar!--the rapture of a true Grecian game--the  emulation of man against man--the generous strife--the half-mournful  triumph--so proud to contend with a noble foe, so sad to see him  overcome! But ye understand me not.'    'The kid is excellent,' said Sallust.  The slave, whose duty it was to  carve, and who valued himself on his science, had just performed that  office on the kid to the sound of music, his knife keeping time,  beginning with a low tenor and accomplishing the arduous feat amidst a  magnificent diapason.    'Your cook is, of course, from Sicily?' said Pansa.    'Yes, of Syracuse.'    'I will play you for him,' said Clodius.  'We will have a game between  the courses.'    'Better that sort of game, certainly, than a beast fight; but I cannot  stake my Sicilian--you have nothing so precious to stake me in return.'    'My Phillida--my beautiful dancing-girl!'    'I never buy women,' said the Greek, carelessly rearranging his chaplet.    The musicians, who were stationed in the portico without, had commenced  their office with the kid; they now directed the melody into a more  soft, a more gay, yet it may be a more intellectual strain; and they  chanted that song of Horace beginning 'Persicos odi', etc., so  impossible to translate, and which they imagined applicable to a feast  that, effeminate as it seems to us, was simple enough for the gorgeous  revelry of the time.

They went across the frozen river until they came to a small hole in  the ice.    \"Now, Mr. Bear,\" said the fox, \"sit down here on the ice and put your  tail through the hole. You must keep still for a long while. That is the  best way to catch fish.    Wait until a great many fish take hold of your tail. Then pull with all  your might.\"    The bear sat very still for a long time.    At last he began to feel cold and he moved a little.    \"Ow!\" he cried, for his tail had begun freeze in the ice.    \"Is it not time to pull out the fish?\" said the bear.    \"No, no,\" cried the fox.    \"Wait until more fish have taken hold of your tail. You are very strong.  You can wait a little longer.\"    So the poor bear waited until it was almost morning.    [Illustration]    Just then some dogs began to bark on the bank of the river.    The bear was so afraid that he jumped up quickly and pulled with all his  might, but his tail was frozen fast in the ice.    He pulled and pulled until at length the tail was broken short off.    Mr. Fox ran away laughing and laughing at the trick he had played upon  Mr. Bear.    Bears' tails have been short ever since.    _German Folk Tale_          [Illustration]    RUMPELSTILTSKIN--I    glistened  guess  mourn  chamber      Once upon a time there lived a miller who had a beautiful daughter.    Now the miller had to visit the king's castle and, while there, he  happened to meet the king face to face.    The king stopped and spoke to the miller. The miller, wishing the king  to think that he was very rich, told him that he had a daughter who  could spin straw into gold.    \"Ah,\" said the king, \"that is indeed a wonderful gift. To-morrow you  must bring your daughter to my castle, that she may spin some gold for  me.\"    Then the miller was afraid and wished he had not spoken, but he had to  do as the king ordered.    The next day he brought his daughter to the castle.    Now it happened that the king loved gold above all things. So taking the  poor girl by the hand, he led her into one of the great rooms of the  castle.    There, in the middle of the room, stood a spinning wheel, and near it  was a great heap of straw.    The king turned to the miller's daughter, and said:    \"There is your spinning wheel, and here is the straw. If you do not spin  all of it into gold by morning, your head shall be cut off.\"    Then the king left the room and locked the door behind him.    The poor girl could only sit and weep, for she had not the least idea  how to spin straw into gold.    While she was crying, the door flew open and a little old man stepped  into the room.    He had bandy legs, a long red nose, and wore a tall, peaked cap. Bowing  low to the maiden he said:    \"Good evening, my dear young lady. Why are you crying?\"    \"Alas,\" said the girl, \"the king has ordered me to spin all this straw  into gold, and I do not know how.\"    Then the little man said, \"What will you give me if I will spin it for  you?\"    \"This string of gold beads from my neck,\" said the girl.    The little man took the beads, and, sitting down, began to spin.    Whir! whir! went the wheel; round and round it whirled.    Lo, as the maiden looked, she saw the coarse straw turn into beautiful  golden threads.    The little man kept so busily at work that soon all the straw was gone,  and in its place lay a heap of the finest gold.    The next morning the king unlocked the door. How his eyes sparkled at  the sight of the gold!    These riches made the king even more greedy than before.    He led the maiden to a still larger chamber, which was full of straw.    Turning to the trembling girl, he said, \"There is your spinning wheel,  and here is the straw. If you do not spin all of it into gold by  morning, your head shall be cut off.\"    The maiden's eyes filled with tears at the sight of that huge heap of  straw. Sitting down, she began to cry.    All at once the door opened and in jumped the little old man. He took  off his pointed cap and said to the miller's daughter, \"What will you  give me if I help you again, and spin this straw into gold?\"    \"This ring from my finger,\" said the maiden.    The little man took the ring, and seating himself before the spinning  wheel, began to spin.    Whir! whir! went the wheel. Faster and faster it whirled.    In the morning the straw had all been turned into finest gold.    When the king opened the door, how his eyes glistened at the sight of  the gold! Still, it only made him greedy for more, so taking the poor  girl by the hand, he led her to a much larger chamber.    This was so full of straw that there was hardly room for her to sit at  the spinning wheel.    Turning to the maiden, the king said:    \"There is your spinning wheel, and here is the straw. If you do not spin  all of it into gold by morning, your head shall be cut off. But if you  do spin the gold, I will marry you and make you my queen.\"    \"For,\" thought the king, \"though she is only a miller's daughter, yet  she can make me the richest king in the world.\"    Hardly had the door closed behind the king, when the little old man came  hopping and skipping into the room.    Taking off his pointed cap, he said to the girl, \"What will you give me  if I will again spin this straw for you?\"    \"Ah!\" said the maiden, \"I have nothing more to give.\"    \"Then you must make me a promise,\" said the little man. \"You must  promise to give me your first child, after you have become queen.\"    [Illustration]    The poor girl saw no other way to save her life, so she gave her promise  to the little man.    Then he sat down and began to spin.    Whir! whir! went the wheel. Faster and faster he spun.    Soon the great roomful of straw was all turned into gold.    When the king opened the door the next morning, he saw the maiden  sitting beside a large heap of shining gold.    The king kept his promise, and made the poor miller's daughter his  queen.      RUMPELSTILTSKIN--II    About a year later the queen had a lovely child, but she forgot all  about her promise.    One day the little old man came hopping into the queen's room and said,  \"Now give me what you have promised.\"    The queen was filled with terror, and offered the little man all the  riches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child.    \"No, I do not care for riches; you must keep your promise.\"    Then the queen began to mourn and to weep, until the little man had pity  for her.    \"I will give you three days,\" he said, \"and if, in that time, you can  guess my name, you shall keep the child.\"    The queen lay awake that night, thinking of all the names she had ever  heard. In the morning men were sent to every part of the kingdom to find  strange names.    The next day the little man came again. The queen began to call off to  him all the names that she had found--Caspar, Melchior, and many, many  others.    At each one the little man shook his head, and said, \"No, that is not my  name.\"    Then the queen had her men go from house to house through the town. They  took down the name of every man, woman, and child.    When the little man came again, the queen had a long list of names to  give him.    \"Is your name Cowribs, or Sheepshanks, or Bandy legs?\" she said to him  at last.    He answered to each one, \"No, that is not my name.\"    On the third day the queen's men began to come back from all parts of  the kingdom. They had been far and wide to find new names.    One of these men said, \"I could not find any new names, but going by  some deep woods, I heard a fox wish good-night to a rabbit.    [Illustration]    Soon I came upon a little house, in front of which a fire was burning.  Around this fire danced a little man. He wore a pointed cap, and had a  long nose and bandy legs. As he went hopping and jumping about, first on  one leg and then on the other, he sang:        My baking and brewing I will do to-day,      The queen's son to-morrow I will take away,      No wise man can show the queen where to begin,      For my name, to be sure, is Rumpelstiltskin.\"    The queen clapped her hands for joy. She knew that at last she had found  the name.    She sent the servant away with a bag of gold, and waited for the queer  little man to come to her. At sunset the little fellow came hopping and  skipping up to the queen.    \"Now, O queen,\" he said, \"this is your last chance. Tell me my name.\"    The queen asked, \"Is your name Conrad?\"    \"No.\"    \"Henry?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then your name is Rumpelstiltskin.\"    \"The fairies have told you!\" shouted the little man dancing about.    He became so angry that, in his rage, he stamped his right foot into the  ground.    This made him more angry still, and taking hold of his left foot with  both hands, he pulled so hard that he tore himself quite in two.
