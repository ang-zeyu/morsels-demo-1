It is easy to be supposed that habitual excitement by means of any other  intoxicating drug, as opium, or its various substitutes, must expose  those who practise the dangerous custom to the same inconvenience. Very  frequent use of the nitrous oxide which affects the senses so strongly,  and produces a short but singular state of ecstasy, would probably be  found to occasion this species of disorder. But there are many other  causes which medical men find attended with the same symptom, of  embodying before the eyes of a patient imaginary illusions which are  visible to no one else. This persecution of spectral deceptions is also  found to exist when no excesses of the patient can be alleged as the  cause, owing, doubtless, to a deranged state of the blood or nervous  system.    The learned and acute Dr. Ferriar of Manchester was the first who  brought before the English public the leading case, as it may be called,  in this department, namely, that of Mons. Nicolai, the celebrated  bookseller of Berlin. This gentleman was not a man merely of books, but  of letters, and had the moral courage to lay before the Philosophical  Society of Berlin an account of his own sufferings, from having been, by  disease, subjected to a series of spectral illusions. The leading  circumstances of this case may be stated very shortly, as it has been  repeatedly before the public, and is insisted on by Dr. Ferriar, Dr.  Hibbert, and others who have assumed Demonology as a subject. Nicolai  traces his illness remotely to a series of disagreeable incidents which  had happened to him in the beginning of the year 1791. The depression of  spirits which was occasioned by these unpleasant occurrences, was aided  by the consequences of neglecting a course of periodical bleeding which  he had been accustomed to observe. This state of health brought on the  disposition to see _phantasmata_, who visited, or it may be more  properly said frequented, the apartments of the learned bookseller,  presenting crowds of persons who moved and acted before him, nay, even  spoke to and addressed him. These phantoms afforded nothing unpleasant  to the imagination of the visionary either in sight or expression, and  the patient was possessed of too much firmness to be otherwise affected  by their presence than with a species of curiosity, as he remained  convinced from the beginning to the end of the disorder, that these  singular effects were merely symptoms of the state of his health, and  did not in any other respect regard them as a subject of apprehension.  After a certain time, and some use of medicine, the phantoms became less  distinct in their outline, less vivid in their colouring, faded, as it  were, on the eye of the patient, and at length totally disappeared.    The case of Nicolai has unquestionably been that of many whose love of  science has not been able to overcome their natural reluctance to  communicate to the public the particulars attending the visitation of a  disease so peculiar. That such illnesses have been experienced, and have  ended fatally, there can be no doubt; though it is by no means to be  inferred, that the symptom of importance to our present discussion has,  on all occasions, been produced from the same identical cause.    Dr. Hibbert, who has most ingeniously, as well as philosophically,  handled this subject, has treated it also in a medical point of view,  with science to which we make no pretence, and a precision of detail to  which our superficial investigation affords us no room for extending  ourselves.    The visitation of spectral phenomena is described by this learned  gentleman as incidental to sundry complaints; and he mentions, in  particular, that the symptom occurs not only in plethora, as in the case  of the learned Prussian we have just mentioned, but is a frequent hectic  symptom--often an associate of febrile and inflammatory  disorders--frequently accompanying inflammation of the brain--a  concomitant also of highly excited nervous irritability--equally  connected with hypochondria--and finally united in some cases with gout,  and in others with the effects of excitation produced by several gases.  In all these cases there seems to be a morbid degree of sensibility,  with which this symptom is ready to ally itself, and which, though  inaccurate as a medical definition, may be held sufficiently descriptive  of one character of the various kinds of disorder with which this  painful symptom may be found allied.    A very singular and interesting illustration of such combinations as Dr.  Hibbert has recorded of the spectral illusion with an actual disorder,  and that of a dangerous kind, was frequently related in society by the  late learned and accomplished Dr. Gregory of Edinburgh, and sometimes, I  believe, quoted by him in his lectures. The narrative, to the author's  best recollection, was as follows:--A patient of Dr. Gregory, a person,  it is understood, of some rank, having requested the doctor's advice,  made the following extraordinary statement of his complaint. \"I am in  the habit,\" he said, \"of dining at five, and exactly as the hour of six  arrives I am subjected to the following painful visitation. The door of  the room, even when I have been weak enough to bolt it, which I have  sometimes done, flies wide open; an old hag, like one of those who  haunted the heath of Forres, enters with a frowning and incensed  countenance, comes straight up to me with every demonstration of spite  and indignation which could characterize her who haunted the merchant  Abudah in the Oriental tale; she rushes upon me, says something, but so  hastily that I cannot discover the purport, and then strikes me a severe  blow with her staff. I fall from my chair in a swoon, which is of longer  or shorter endurance. To the recurrence of this apparition I am daily  subjected. And such is my new and singular complaint.\" The doctor  immediately asked whether his patient had invited any one to sit with  him when he expected such a visitation. He was answered in the negative.  The nature of the complaint, he said, was so singular, it was so likely  to be imputed to fancy, or even to mental derangement, that he had  shrunk from communicating the circumstance to any one. \"Then,\" said the  doctor, \"with your permission, I will dine with you to-day,  _tete-a-tete_, and we will see if your malignant old woman will venture  to join our company.\" The patient accepted the proposal with hope and  gratitude, for he had expected ridicule rather than sympathy. They met  at dinner, and Dr. Gregory, who suspected some nervous disorder, exerted  his powers of conversation, well known to be of the most varied and  brilliant character, to keep the attention of his host engaged, and  prevent him from thinking on the approach of the fated hour, to which he  was accustomed to look forward with so much terror. He succeeded in his  purpose better than he had hoped. The hour of six came almost unnoticed,  and it was hoped might pass away without any evil consequence; but it  was scarce a moment struck when the owner of the house exclaimed, in an  alarmed voice, \"The hag comes again!\" and dropped back in his chair in a  swoon, in the way he had himself described. The physician caused him to  be let blood, and satisfied himself that the periodical shocks of which  his patient complained arose from a tendency to apoplexy.    The phantom with the crutch was only a species of machinery, such as  that with which fancy is found to supply the disorder called  _Ephialtes_, or nightmare, or indeed any other external impression upon  our organs in sleep, which the patient's morbid imagination may  introduce into the dream preceding the swoon. In the nightmare an  oppression and suffocation is felt, and our fancy instantly conjures up  a spectre to lie on our bosom. In like manner it may be remarked, that  any sudden noise which the slumberer hears, without being actually  awakened by it--any casual touch of his person occurring in the same  manner--becomes instantly adopted in his dream, and accommodated to the  tenor of the current train of thought, whatever that may happen to be;  and nothing is more remarkable than the rapidity with which imagination  supplies a complete explanation of the interruption, according to the  previous train of ideas expressed in the dream, even when scarce a  moment of time is allowed for that purpose. In dreaming, for example, of  a duel, the external sound becomes, in the twinkling of an eye, the  discharge of the combatants' pistols;--is an orator haranguing in his  sleep, the sound becomes the applause of his supposed audience;--is the  dreamer wandering among supposed ruins, the noise is that of the fall of  some part of the mass. In short, an explanatory system is adopted during  sleep with such extreme rapidity, that supposing the intruding alarm to  have been the first call of some person to awaken the slumberer, the  explanation, though requiring some process of argument or deduction, is  usually formed and perfect before the second effort of the speaker has  restored the dreamer to the waking world and its realities. So rapid and  intuitive is the succession of ideas in sleep, as to remind us of the  vision of the prophet Mahommed, in which he saw the whole wonders of  heaven and hell, though the jar of water which fell when his ecstasy  commenced, had not spilled its contents when he returned to ordinary  existence.

I remember everyone thought then that this Charter  would surely be confiscated, on account of the illegal proceedings of  its forces.    The fact of Mr. Rhodes's departure was kept a profound secret, as he  wished to avoid any demonstration. The mail-steamer was the even then  antiquated _Moor_ of the Union Line, and she was lying a quarter of a  mile away from the docks, awaiting her mail-bags and her important  passengers. Besides Mrs. Harry Lawson and ourselves, Mr. Rhodes, Mr.  Beit, and Dr. Rutherford Harris, the two latter of whom were also going  to England, embarked quite unnoticed on a small launch, ostensibly to  make a tour of the harbour, which as a matter of fact we did, whilst  waiting for the belated mail. An object of interest was the chartered P.  and O. transport _Victoria_, which had only the day before arrived from  Bombay, with the Lancashire Regiment, 1,000 strong, on board, having  been suddenly stopped here on her way home, pessimists at once declaring  the reason to be possible trouble with Germany. A very noble appearance  she presented that afternoon, with her lower decks and portholes simply  swarming with red-coats, who appeared to take a deep interest in our  movements. At last we boarded the mail-steamer, and then I had the  chance of a few words with the travellers, and of judging how past  events had affected them. Mr. Beit looked ill and worried; Mr. Rhodes,  on the other hand, seemed to be in robust health, and as calm as the  proverbial cucumber. I had an interesting talk to him before we left the  ship; he said frankly that, for the first time in his life, during six  nights of the late crisis he had not been able to sleep, and that he had  been worried to death.    \"Now,\" he added, \"I have thought the whole matter out, I have decided  what is best to be done, so I am all right again, and I do not consider  at forty-three that my career is ended.\"    \"I am quite sure it is not, Mr. Rhodes,\" was my reply; \"and, what is  more, I have a small bet with Mr. Lawson that in a year's time you will  be in office again, or, if not absolutely in office, as great a factor  in South African politics as you have been up to now.\"    He thought a minute, and then said:    \"It will take ten years; better cancel your bet.\"[5] was careful not to  ask him any questions which might be embarrassing for him to answer, but  he volunteered that the objects of his visit to England were, first, to  do the best he could for his friends at Johannesburg, including his  brother Frank, who were now political prisoners, practically at the  mercy of the Boers, unless the Imperial Government bestirred itself on  their behalf; and, secondly, to save his Charter, if by any means it  could be saved. This doubt seemed to haunt him. \"My argument is,\" I  remember he said, \"they may take away the Charter or leave it, but there  is one fact that no man can alter--viz., that a vast and valuable  territory has been opened up by that Company in about half the time, and  at about a quarter the cost, which the Imperial Government would have  required for a like task; so that whether, in consequence of one bad  blunder, and partly in order to snub me, Cecil Rhodes, the Company is to  cease, or whether it is allowed to go on with its work, its achievements  and their results must and will speak for themselves.\" With reference to  the political prisoners, I recollect he repeated more than once:    \"You see, I stand in so much stronger a position than they do, in that I  am not encumbered with wife and children; so I am resolved to strain  every nerve on their behalf.\" About six o'clock the last bell rang, and,  cutting short our conversation, I hurriedly wished him good-bye and good  luck, and from the deck of our little steamer we watched the big ship  pass out into the night.    We had now been a month in South Africa, and had seen very little of the  country, and it appeared that we had chosen a very unfavourable moment  for our visit. We were determined, however, not to return home without  seeing the Transvaal, peaceful or the reverse. The question was, how to  get there. By train one had to allow three days and four nights, and,  since the rebellion, to put up with insults into the bargain at the  frontier, where luggage and even wearing apparel were subjected to a  minute search, involving sometimes a delay of five hours. Our projected  departure by sea via Natal was postponed indefinitely, by the  non-arrival of the incoming mail-steamer from England, the old _Roslin  Castle_, which was living up to her reputation of breaking down, by  being days overdue, so that it was impossible to say when she would be  able to leave for Durban. Under these circumstances Sir Hercules  Robinson proved a friend in need; and, having admonished us to secrecy,  he told us that the P. and O. _Victoria_, the troopship we had noticed  in the harbour, was under orders to leave at once for Durban to pick up  Dr. Jameson and the other Raiders at that port; and convey them to  England; therefore, as we only wanted to go as far as Durban, he would  manage, by permission of the Admiral at Cape Town, to get us passages on  board this ship. Of course we were delighted, and early next morning we  embarked. It was the first time I had ever been on a troopship, and  every moment was of interest. As spick and span as a man-of-war, with  her wide, roomy decks, it was difficult to imagine there were 2,000  souls on board the _Victoria_, and only in the morning, when the  regiment paraded, appearing like ants from below, and stretching in  unbroken lines all down both sides of the ship, did one realize how  large was the floating population, and how strict must be the discipline  necessary to keep so many men healthy, contented, and efficient. There  were a few other civilians going home on leave, but we were the only  so-called \"indulgence passengers.\" The time passed all too quickly, the  monotonous hours of all shipboard life, between the six-thirty dinner  and bedtime, being whiled away by listening to an excellent military  band.    We were told to be dressed and ready to disembark by 6 a.m. on the  morning we were due at Durban, as the Admiral had given stringent  instructions not to delay there any longer than was necessary. I was  therefore horrified, on awaking at five o'clock, to find the engines had  already stopped, and, on looking out of the porthole, to see a large  tender approaching from the shore, apparently full of people. I  scrambled into my clothes, but long before I was dressed the tug was  alongside, or as nearly alongside as the heavy swell and consequent deep  rolls of our ship would allow. Durban boasts of no harbour for large  ships. These have to lie outside the bar, and a smooth sea being the  exception on this part of the coast, disembarking is in consequence  almost always effected in a sort of basket cage, worked by a crane, and  holding three or four people. When I got on deck, the prisoners were  still on the tender, being mercilessly rolled about, and they must  indeed have been glad when, at six o'clock, the signal to disembark was  given.    I shall never forget that striking and melancholy scene. The dull grey  morning, of which the dawn had scarcely broken; the huge rollers of the  leaden sea, which were lifting our mighty ship as if she had been but a  cockleshell; and the tiny steamer, at a safe distance, her deck crowded  with sunburnt men, many of whose faces were familiar to us, and who were  picturesquely attired, for the most part, in the very same clothes they  had worn on their ill-fated march--flannel shirts, khaki breeches, high  boots, and the large felt hats of the Bechuanaland Border Police, which  they were wearing probably for the last time. As soon as they came on  board we were able to have a few hasty words with those we knew, and  their faces seem to pass in front of me as I write: Sir John Willoughby  and Captain C. Villiers, both in the Royal Horse Guards, apparently  nonchalant and without a care in the world; Colonel Harry White--alas!  dead--and his brother Bobby, who were as fit as possible and as cheery  as ever, but inclined to be mutinous with their unwilling gaolers; Major  Stracey,[6] Scots Guards, with his genial and courtly manners,  apparently still dazed at finding himself a prisoner and amongst rebels;  Mr. Cyril Foley, one of the few civilians, and Mr. Harold Grenfell,[7]  1st Life Guards, like boys who expect a good scolding when they get  home; and last, but not least, Dr. Jameson, to whom we were introduced.  \"What will they do with us?\" was the universal question, and on this  point we could give them no information; but it can be imagined they  were enchanted to see some friendly faces after a fortnight's  incarceration in a Boer prison, during the first part of which time they  daily expected to be led out and shot. I remember asking Dr. Jameson  what I think must have been a very embarrassing question, although he  did not seem to resent it. It was whether an express messenger from  Johannesburg, telling him not to start, as the town was not unanimous  and the movement not ripe, had reached him the day before he left  Mafeking. He gave no direct answer, but remarked: \"I received so many  messages from day to day, now telling me to come, then to delay  starting, that I thought it best to make up their minds for them, before  the Boers had time to get together.\"    We were soon hurried on shore, as Mr. Beresford,[8] the 7th Hussars, who  had brought the prisoners on board, had to return to the town to make  some necessary purchases for them, in the way of clothes, for they  possessed nothing but what they stood up in.    We left Durban immediately by train for Pietermaritzburg, where we were  the guests of Sir Walter and Lady Hely Hutchinson, at Government House,  a very small but picturesque residence where Lady Hely Hutchinson  received "]]]
