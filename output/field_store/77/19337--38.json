FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE SKIN.    1. My skin covers my body.    2. It is thin, elastic, flexible, porous, and absorbent.    3. I have two skins; the inner skin is the true skin.    4. My true skin is elastic, and like a net-work of blood-vessels and  nerves. My true skin is covered with a jelly-like substance which gives  color to my skin.    5. My outside skin is not the same thickness over my whole body. In some  parts, as on the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet, it is very  thick and tough.    6. If my outside skin be destroyed, it will grow again; if the jelly-like  substance be destroyed, it will re-appear; but if my true skin be  destroyed, it will never be perfectly renewed.    7. More than half of the waste substance of my body passes from it through  the pores of the skin, in the form of perspiration.    8. If I would have a healthy skin,      I must perspire freely all the time,      I must keep my body clean,      I must wear clean clothing,      I must breathe pure air,      and live in the sunlight.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.    1. Where is your skin?    2. Tell about the skin.    3. How many skins have you?    4. Tell about the true skin.    5. What difference is there in the thickness of your outside skin?    6. What happens if the different skins be destroyed?    7. What passes through the pores of the skin?    8.

Of what use is the skin?--\"It covers the muscles of the body.\"    What can you tell about it?--\"It is flexible, elastic, porous, and  absorbent.\"    Why do you say it is flexible?--\"Because it is easily bent.\"    Why do you say it is porous?--\"Because it is full of little holes, or  pores.\"    Why do you say it is elastic?--\"Because it will spring back after it is  stretched, squeezed, twisted, or bent.\"    Why do you say it is absorbent?--\"Because it will soak up liquids.\"    How many skins have you?--\"Two; an outside skin, and an inner skin.\"    Which is the true skin?--\"The inner skin.\"    Of what is the inner skin composed?--\"Of blood-vessels and nerves.\"    How do you know that the outer skin has no blood-vessels?--\"Because if I  put a pin through the outer skin the blood does not flow out, as it would  if I had cut a blood-vessel.\"    How do you know the outer skin has no nerves?--\"Because if I put a pin  through my outer skin it does not make me suffer pain, as it would if I had  touched a nerve.\"    What gives color to the skin?--\"A jelly-like substance between the inner  and the outer skin.\"    What have you learned about the true skin?--\"That it is of the same color  in people of every nation.\"    What difference is there in the thickness of the outer skin? [See Formula.]    What passes through the pores of the skin? [See Formula.]    What is this waste called when it comes from the surface of the  skin?--\"Perspiration.\"    When does the perspiration flow through the pores of the skin?--\"All the  time, if the skin is healthy.\"    Why do we not always see the perspiration which passes through the  pores?--\"Because it does not always form drops on the surface of the skin;  it generally passes off in very fine particles.\"    What becomes of the fine or minute portions of perspiration which pass from  the body?--\"Some of these portions are absorbed by the clothing; some pass  into and mix with the air around us.\"    What effect does the perspiration produce on the air and the clothing?--\"It  soon makes the air unfit to be breathed, and the clothing unfit to be  worn.\"    What is necessary if you would have a healthy skin? [See Formula.]    Why must you wear clean clothing?--\"That there may be nothing impure in the  clothing for the pores of the skin to absorb.\"    Why should you breathe pure air?--\"Because air purifies the blood, and pure  blood is necessary to make a healthy skin.\"    How does drinking alcoholic liquors hurt the skin?--\"It makes the blood  impure, and impure blood makes unhealthy skin.\"    In what other way does drinking these liquors hurt the skin?--\"It gives the  skin too much work to do.\"    How does it give it too much work to do?--\"It makes more waste substance to  pass from it through the pores, in the form of perspiration.\"    In what other way does drinking alcoholic liquors hurt the skin?--\"It makes  it a bad color.\"    How does it make the skin a bad color?--\"It stretches the little  blood-vessels of the skin, and makes them too full of blood.\" See Appendix.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: THE HEART.]    A, the right ventricle; B, the left ventricle; C, the right auricle D, the  left auricle; E, the aorta; F, the pulmonary artery.           *       *       *       *       *    PART VIII.    FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE HEART AND THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.    1. My heart is shaped like a cone, and placed in my chest near my  breastbone, with its apex pointing downward to my left side. It beats about  seventy times a minute, sending out about two ounces of blood at every  beat.    2. The blood when pure is of a bright red color; it is a liquid made from  food and drink.    3. It passes from my heart to all parts of my body, through pipes called  arteries; these arteries spread out through the body like branches from a  tree.    4. As the blood flows from the heart, through the arteries, it gives  nourishment to every part of the body, and carries away the impurities it  meets, which makes it black and thick; when it comes through the veins,  back to the heart, it is not fit to be used, so it goes to the lungs to be  purified by the fresh air; then it returns to the heart to be sent again  throughout the body; this happens once in from three to eight minutes, and  is called the circulation of the blood.    7. If I would be healthy,      my blood must be pure and circulate freely all the time.    8. It will not circulate freely,      if I wear tight clothing,      if I do not exercise in work or play,      if I do not keep my body warm.    9. It will be impure,      if I breathe bad air,      if I eat unwholesome food,      if I drink alcoholic liquors,      if I snuff, smoke, or chew tobacco.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.    1. Tell about the heart and where it is placed.    2. Tell about the blood and of what it is made.    3. Where does the good blood pass after it is sent out from the heart?    4. Tell what the blood does as it flows through the body.    5. What is this flowing of the blood to and from the heart called?    6. How often does it happen?    7. What is necessary if you would have pure blood?    8. When will the blood not circulate freely?    9. When will the blood be impure?           *       *       *       *       *    HOW TO TREAT A WOUND.    If it is only a flesh-wound or slight cut, wash it with cold water and  bandage it with a clean, white rag. The edges of a deep cut should be drawn  together and held in place by narrow strips of adhesive plaster, fastened  across the wound from side to side.    If the cut is very deep, and the blood flows very freely, send for a  doctor. While you wait for him, knot a handkerchief, or suspender, or  towel, in the middle, and twist it very tightly _over the cut artery, above  the wound_. If a vein has been severed, twist the knotted handkerchief  _below the wound_. If the blood continues to flow, tie a bandage both above  and below the hurt part.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS ON THE HEART AND THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.

No doubt he travels those stairs twenty times a day. He is as alert  as a young man; doubtless he still has his voice, as he says. And what a  career he has had. You know he was a friend of Edward the Seventh; they  once lived together. Then he and Verdi were close friends; he helped  coach singers for Verdi's operas. He says it was a wonderful  experience, when the composer sat down at the piano, put his hands on  the keys and showed the singers how he wanted his music sung!    \"Early in his career Maurel sang in Verdi's opera, _Simone Boccanegra_,  which one never hears now, but it has a fine baritone part, and a couple  of very dramatic scenes, especially the final scene at the close. This  is the death scene. Maurel had sung and acted so wonderfully on a  certain occasion that all the singers about him were in tears. Verdi was  present at this performance and was deeply moved by Maurel's singing and  acting. He came upon the stage when all was over, and exclaimed, in a  voice trembling with emotion: 'You have created the role just as I would  have it; I shall write an opera especially _for you_!' This he did; it  was _Othello_, and the Iago was composed for Maurel. In his later years,  when he seldom left his home, the aged composer several times expressed  the wish that he might go to Paris, just to hear Maurel sing once more.    \"It is very interesting that he was led to speak to us as he did just  now, about mental control, and the part played by mind in the singer's  study, equipment and career. It is a side of the question which every  young singer must seriously consider, first, last and always. But here  he comes.\"    Again protesting about the appearance of his simple studio, the master  led the way up the stairways till we reached the top of the house, where  a north-lighted room had been turned into a painter's atelier. With  mingled feelings we stepped within this modest den of a great artist,  which held his treasures. These were never shown to the casual observer,  nor to the merely curious; they were reserved for the trusted few.    The walls were lined with sketches; heads, still life, landscapes, all  subjects alike interested the painter. A rugged bust of Verdi, over life  size, modeled in plaster, stood in one corner. On an easel rested a  spirited portrait of Maurel, done by himself.    \"My friends tell me I should have a larger studio, with better light;  but I am content with this, for here is quiet and here I can be alone,  free to commune with myself. Here I can study my art undisturbed,--for  Art is my religion. If people ask if I go to church, I say No, but I  worship the immortality which is within, which I feel in my soul, the  reflection of the Almighty!\"    In quiet mood a little later we descended the white stairway and passed  along the corridors of this house, which looks so foreign to American  eyes, and has the atmosphere of a Paris home.    The artist accompanied us to the street door and bade us farewell, in  his kindly dignified manner.    As the door closed and we were in the street, my friend said:    \"A wonderful man and a rare artist. Where shall we find his like  to-day?\"          IV    A VISIT TO MME. LILLI LEHMANN      A number of years before the great war, a party of us were spending a  few weeks in Berlin. It was midsummer; the city, filled as it was for  one of us at least, with dear memories of student days, was in most  alluring mood. Flowers bloomed along every balcony, vines festooned  themselves from windows and doorways, as well as from many unexpected  corners. The parks, large and small, which are the delight of a great  city, were at their best and greenest--gay with color. Many profitable  hours were spent wandering through the galleries and museums, hearing  concerts and opera, and visiting the old quarters of the city, so  picturesque and full of memories.    Two of us, who were musicians, were anxious to meet the famous dramatic  soprano, Lilli Lehmann, who was living quietly in one of the suburbs of  the city. Notes were exchanged, and on a certain day we were bidden to  come, out of the regular hours for visitors, by \"special exception.\"    How well I remember the drive through the newer residential section of  Berlin. The path before long led us through country estates, past  beautifully kept gardens and orchards. Our destination was the little  suburb of Gruenewald, itself like a big garden, with villas nestling  close to each other, usually set back from the quiet, shaded streets.  Some of the villas had iron gratings along the pathway, through which  one saw gay flowers and garden walks, often statuary and fountains.  Other homes were secluded from the street by high brick walls,  frequently decorated on top by urns holding flowers and drooping vines.    Behind such a picturesque barrier, we found the gateway which led to  Mme. Lehmann's cottage. We rang and soon a trim maid came to undo the  iron gate. The few steps leading to the house door did not face us as we  entered the inclosure, but led up from the side. We wanted to linger and  admire the shrubs and flowering plants, but the maid hastened before us  so we had to follow.    From the wide entrance hall doors led into rooms on either hand. We were  shown into a salon on the left, and bidden to await Madame's coming.    In the few moments of restful quiet before she entered, we had time to  glance over this sanctum of a great artist. To say it was filled with  mementos and _objets d'art_ hardly expresses the sense of repleteness.  Every square foot was occupied by some treasure. Let the eye travel  around the room. At the left, as one entered the doorway, stood a fine  bust of the artist, chiseled in pure white marble, supported on a  pedestal of black marble. Then came three long, French windows, opening  into a green garden. Across the farther window stood a grand piano,  loaded with music. At the further end of the room, if memory serves,  hung a large, full length portrait of the artist herself. A writing  desk, laden with souvenirs, stood near. On the opposite side a divan  covered with rich brocade; more paintings on the walls, one very large  landscape by a celebrated German painter.    Before we could note further details, Mme. Lehmann stood in the doorway,  then came forward and greeted us cordially.    How often I had seen her impersonate her great roles, both in Germany  and America. They were always of some queenly character. Could it be  possible this was the famous Lehmann, this simple housewife, in black  skirt and white blouse, with a little apron as badge of home keeping.  But there was the stately tread, the grand manner, the graceful  movement. What mattered if the silver hair were drawn back severely from  the face; there was the dignity of expression, classic features,  penetrating glance and mobile mouth I remembered.    After chatting a short time and asking many questions about America,  where her experiences had been so pleasant, our talk was interrupted,  for a little, by a voice trial, which Madame had agreed to give. Many  young singers, from everywhere, were anxious to have expert judgment on  their progress or attainments, so Lehmann was often appealed to and gave  frequent auditions of this kind. The fee was considerable, but she never  kept a penny of it for herself; it all went to one of her favorite  charities. The young girl who on this day presented herself for the  ordeal was an American, who, it seemed, had not carried her studies very  far.      EXAMINING A PUPIL    Mme. Lehmann seated herself at the piano and asked for scales and  vocalizes. The young girl, either from fright or poor training, did not  make a very fortunate impression. She could not seem to bring out a  single pure steady tone, much less sing scales acceptably.    Madame with a resigned look finally asked for a song, which was given.  It was a little song of Franz, I remember. Then Lehmann wheeled around  on the stool and said to us, in German:    \"The girl cannot sing--she has little or no voice to begin with, and has  not been rightly trained.\" Then to the young girl she said, kindly, in  English:    \"My dear young lady, you have almost everything to learn about singing,  for as yet you cannot even sing one tone correctly; you cannot even  speak correctly. First of all you need physical development; you must  broaden your chest through breathing exercises; you are too thin  chested. You must become physically stronger if you ever hope to sing  acceptably. Then you must study diction and languages. This is  absolutely necessary for the singer. Above all you must know how to  pronounce and sing in your own language. So many do not think it  necessary to study their own language; they think they know that  already; but one's mother tongue requires study as well as any other  language.    \"The trouble with American girls is they are always in a hurry. They are  not content to sit down quietly and study till they have developed  themselves into something before they ever think of coming to Europe.  They think if they can just come over here and sing for an artist, that  fact alone will give them prestige in America. But that gives them quite  the opposite reputation over here. American girls are too often looked  upon as superficial, because they come over here quite unprepared. I say  to all of them, as I say to you: Go home and study; there are plenty of  good teachers of voice and piano in your own land. Then, when you can  _sing_, come over here, if you wish; but do not come until you are  prepared.\"    After this little episode, we continued our talk for a while longer.  Then, fearing to trespass on her time, we rose to leave. She came to the  door with us, followed us down the steps into the front garden, and held  the gate open for us, when we finally left. We had already expressed the  hope that she might be able to return to America, at no very distant  day, and "]]]
