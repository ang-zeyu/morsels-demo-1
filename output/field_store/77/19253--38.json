Besides, all the  other officers here enumerated are purely ecclesiastical officers; how  groundless then and inconsistent is it under this name of _Governments_  to introduce a foreign power, viz. the political magistrate, into the  list and roll of mere church officers? Finally, the civil magistrate, as  a magistrate, is not so much as a member of the visible Church, (for  then all Pagan magistrates should be members of the Church,) much less a  governor in the Church of Christ. 5. That this government settled in the  Church is of divine right; for, of those _Governments_, as well as of  _Apostles, Prophets_, and _Teachers_, it is said, _God hath set_ them  _in the Church. God hath set_ them, _hath put, set_--Tremellius out of  the Syriac. Hath _constituted, ordained_--Beza out of the Greek. Now, if  they be set in the Church and God hath set them there, here is a plain  divine right for government in the Church.    Add hereto, 2 Cor. x. 8, \"Of our authority, which the Lord hath given to  us for the edification, and not for the destruction of you.\" Here are  mentioned--1. Church power or authority for government in the Church. 2.  The end of this power--positively, for the edification; negatively, not  for the destruction of the Church. 3. The Author or Fountain of this  authority--the Lord Christ hath given it, dispensed it; there is the  divine right. 4. The proper subjects intrusted with this authority, viz:  the church guides, our authority, which he hath given to us. They are  the receptacle of power for the Church, and the government thereof.  Compare also 1 Thes. v. 12, Matth. xvi. 19, 20, with xviii. 11, and John  xx. 21, 22, 23. In which and divers like places the divine right of  church government is apparently vouched by the Scripture, as will  hereafter more fully appear; but this may suffice in general for the  confirmation of this general proposition.          CHAPTER II.    _Of the Nature of a_ DIVINE RIGHT _in general._      Now touching this divine right of church government, two things are yet  more particularly to be opened and proved, for the more satisfactory  clearing thereof unto sober minds, to unprejudiced and unpre-engaged  judgments, viz:--1. What the nature of a divine right is, and how many  ways a thing may be said to be of divine right, and that by warrant of  Scripture. 2. What the nature of the government of the Church under the  New Testament is, which is vouched by the Scripture to be of divine  right.    For the first--viz. What the nature of a divine right is--consider both  what a divine right is in general, and how many ways a thing may be said  by Scripture warrant to be of divine right in particular.    _Right_ is that which is most proper, just, or equal; or that which is  prescribed or commanded by some statute law, and is just to be received  in virtue of said law.    _Divine_ sometimes points out a divine warrant or authority from God,  engraven or enstamped upon any thing, whereby it is exalted above all  human or created authority and power. And thus, all Scripture is styled  divinely breathed or inspired of God. Hence is the divine authority of  Scripture asserted, 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17; and in this sense divine right  is here spoken of, in reference to church government, as it signifies a  divine warrant and authority from God himself, engraven upon that church  government and discipline, (hereafter to be handled,) and revealed to us  in his holy Scriptures, the infallible and perfect oracles. So that  divine right, according to this interpretation of the terms, is that  which is either just, meet, and equal; or commanded and enjoined by any  divine warrant or authority. And generally, a thing may be said to be of  divine right, which is any way divinely just, equal, &c.; or divinely  commanded by any law of God, or by that which is equivalent to a divine  law. And whatsoever matters in church government can be proved by  Scripture to have this stamp of divine warrant and authority set upon  them, they may properly be said to be of divine right, and that by the  will and appointment of Jesus Christ, to whom God hath delegated all  power and authority for the government of his Church, Matth. xxviii. 18,  19, 20, Isa. ix. 6, John v. 22, Eph. i. 22. In this sense, if church  government, or any part of it, be found to be of divine right, then  consequently--1. It is above all mere human power and created authority  in the world whatsoever, and that supereminently. A divine  right is the highest and best tenure whereby the Church can hold of  Christ any doctrine, worship, or government; only God can stamp such a  divine right upon any of these things, whereby conscience shall be  obliged. All human inventions herein, whether devised of our own hearts,  or derived as traditions from others, are incompatible and inconsistent  herewith; vain in themselves, and to all that use them, and condemned of  God. See 1 Kings xii. 32, 33, Isa. xxix. 4, Matth. xv. 6, 7, 8, 9. 2. It  is beyond all just, human, or created power, to abolish or oppose the  same, or the due execution thereof in the Church of Christ; for what is  of divine right, is held of God, and not of man; and to oppose that,  were to fight against God. The supreme magistrates in such cases should  be nurse-fathers, Isa. xlix. 23, not step-fathers to the Church; their  power being cumulative and perfective, not privative and destructive  unto her; for she both had and exercised a power in church government,  long before there was any Christian magistrate in the world; and it  cannot be proved that ever Christ took away that power from his Church,  or translated it to the political magistrate, when he became Christian.  3. It is so obligatory upon all churches in the whole Christian world,  that they ought uniformly to submit themselves unto it; for a divine  right is equally obligatory on one church as well as on another. And it  is so obligatory on all persons, states, and degrees, that none ought to  be exempted from that church government which is of divine right, nor to  be _tolerated_ in another church government, which is but of human  invention; nor ought any Christian to seek after, or content himself  with any such exemption or _toleration_; for in so doing, the inventions  of men should be preferred before the ordinances of God; our own wisdom,  will, and authority, before the wisdom, will, and authority of Christ:  and we should in effect say, _We will not have this man to reign over  us_, Luke xix. 27. _Let us break their bands asunder, and cast their  cords away from us_, Psalm ii. 3.          CHAPTER III.    _Of the Nature of a_ DIVINE RIGHT _in particular. How many ways a thing  may be of_ DIVINE RIGHT. _And first, of a_ DIVINE RIGHT _by the true  light of nature._      Thus we see in general what a divine right is: now in particular let us  come to consider how many ways a thing may be said to be of divine right  by scripture-warrant, keeping still our eye upon this subject of church  government, at which all particulars are to be levelled for the clearing  of it.    A thing may be said to be of divine right, or (which is the same for  substance) of divine institution, divers ways. 1. _By the true light of  nature._ 2. _By obligatory scripture examples._ 3. _By divine  approbation._ 4. _By divine acts._ 5. _By divine precepts or mandates._  All may be reduced to these five heads, ascending by degrees from the  lowest to the highest divine right.    I. _By light of nature._ That which is evident by, and consonant to the  true light of nature, or natural reason, is to be accounted of divine  right in matters of religion. Hence two things are to be made out by  Scripture. 1. What is meant by the true light of nature. 2. How it may  be proved, that what things in religion are evident by, or consonant to  this true light of nature, are of divine right.    1. For the first, What is meant by the true light of nature, or natural  reason? Thus conceive. The light of nature may be considered two ways.  1. As it was in man before the fall, and so it was that image and  similitude of God, in which man was at first created, Gen. i. 26, 27, or  at least part of that image; which image of God, and light of nature,  was con-created with man, and was perfect: viz. so perfect as the sphere  of humanity and state of innocency did require; there was no sinful  darkness, crookedness, or imperfection in it; and whatsoever was evident  by, or consonant to this pure and perfect light of nature, in respect  either of theory or practice, was doubtless of divine right, because  correspondent to that divine law of God's image naturally engraved in  Adam's heart. But man being lapsed, this will not be now our question,  as it is not our case. 2. As it is now in man after the fall. The light  of nature and image of God in man is not totally abolished and utterly  razed by the fall; there remain still some relics and fragments thereof,  some glimmerings, dawnings, and common principles of light, both  touching piety to God, equity to man, and sobriety to a man's self, &c.,  as is evident by comparing these places, Psal. xix. 1, 2, &c., Acts  xiv. 17, and xvii. 27, 28; Rom. i. 18-21, and ii. 12, 14, 15; 2 Cor. v.  1: in which places it is plain, 1. That the book of the creature is able  (without the scriptures, or divine revelations) to make known to man  much of God, his invisible Godhead and attributes, Psalm xix. 1, 2, &c.;  Acts xiv. 17, and xvii. 27, 28; yea, so far as to leave them without  excuse, Rom. i. 18-21. 2. That there remained so much natural light in  the minds even of the heathens, as to render them capable of instruction  by the creature in the invisible things of God; yea, and that they  actually in some measure did know God, and because they walked not up to  this knowledge, were plagued, Rom. i. 18-21, 24, &c. 3. That the work of  the law (though not the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13944"],[0,"After London; Or, Wild England (#5)"],[1,"has been  preserved among them since the days of the ancients. The poison kills  the fishes, and brings them to the surface, when they can be collected  by hundreds, but does not injure them for eating.    Like the black wood-dogs, the Bushmen often in fits of savage frenzy  destroy thrice as much as they can devour, trapping deer in wickerwork  hedges, or pitfalls, and cutting the miserable animals in pieces, for  mere thirst of blood. The oxen and cattle in the enclosures are  occasionally in the same manner fearfully mutilated by these wretches,  sometimes for amusement, and sometimes in vengeance for injuries done to  them. Bushmen have no settled home, cultivate no kind of corn or  vegetable, keep no animals, not even dogs, have no houses or huts, no  boats or canoes, nothing that requires the least intelligence or energy  to construct.    Roaming to and fro without any apparent aim or object, or any particular  route, they fix their camp for a few days wherever it suits their fancy,  and again move on, no man knows why or whither. It is this uncertainty  of movement which makes them so dangerous. To-day there may not be the  least sign of any within miles of an enclosure. In the night a \"camp\"  may pass, slaughtering such cattle as may have remained without the  palisade, or killing the unfortunate shepherd who has not got within the  walls, and in the morning they may be nowhere to be seen, having  disappeared like vermin. Face to face the Bushman is never to be feared;  a whole \"camp\" or tribal family will scatter if a traveler stumbles into  their midst. It is from behind a tree or under cover of night that he  deals his murderous blow.    A \"camp\" may consist of ten or twenty individuals, sometimes, perhaps,  of forty, or even fifty, of various ages, and is ruled by the eldest,  who is also the parent. He is absolute master of his \"camp\", but has no  power or recognition beyond it, so that how many leaders there may be  among them it is not possible even to guess. Nor is the master known to  them as king, or duke, nor has he any title, but is simply the oldest or  founder of the family. The \"camp\" has no law, no established custom;  events happen, and even the master cannot be said to reign. When he  becomes feeble, they simply leave him to die.    They are depraved, and without shame, clad in sheep-skins chiefly, if  clad at all, or in such clothes as they have stolen. They have no  ceremonies whatever. The number of these \"camps\" must be considerable,  and yet the Bushman is seldom seen, nor do we very often hear of their  depredations, which is accounted for by the extent of country they  wander over. It is in severe winters that the chief danger occurs; they  then suffer from hunger and cold, and are driven to the neighbourhood of  the enclosures to steal. So dexterous are they in slipping through the  bushes, and slinking among the reeds and osiers, that they will pass  within a few yards without discovering their presence, and the signs of  their passage can be detected only by the experienced hunter, and not  always by him.    It is observed that whatever mischief the Bushman commits, he never sets  fire to any ricks or buildings; the reason is because his nature is to  slink from the scene of his depredations, and flame at once attracts  people to the spot. Twice the occurrence of a remarkably severe winter  has caused the Bushmen to flock together and act in an approach to  concert in attacking the enclosures. The Bushmen of the north, who were  even more savage and brutal, then came down, and were with difficulty  repulsed from the walled cities. In ordinary times we see very little of  them. They are the thieves, the human vermin of the woods.    Under the name of gipsies, those who are now often called Romany and  Zingari were well known to the ancients. Indeed, they boast that their  ancestry goes back so much farther than the oldest we can claim, that  the ancients themselves were but modern to them. Even in that age of  highest civilization, which immediately preceded the present, they say  (and there is no doubt of it) that they preserved the blood of their  race pure and untainted, that they never dwelt under permanent roofs,  nor bowed their knees to the prevalent religion. They remained apart,  and still continue after civilization has disappeared, exactly the same  as they were before it commenced.    Since the change their numbers have greatly increased, and were they not  always at war with each other, it is possible that they might go far to  sweep the house people from the land. But there are so many tribes, each  with its king, queen, or duke, that their power is divided, and their  force melts away. The ruler of the Bushman families is always a man, but  among the gipsies a woman, and even a young girl, often exercises  supreme authority, but must be of the sacred blood. These kings and  dukes are absolute autocrats within their tribe, and can order by a nod  the destruction of those who offend them. Habits of simplest obedience  being enjoined on the tribe from earliest childhood, such executions are  rare, but the right to command them is not for a moment questioned.    Of the sorcerers, and particularly the sorceresses, among them, all have  heard, and, indeed, the places where they dwell seem full of mystery and  magic. They live in tents, and though they constantly remove from  district to district, one tribe never clashes with or crosses another,  because all have their especial routes, upon which no intrusion is ever  made. Some agriculture is practiced, and flocks and herds are kept, but  the work is entirely done by the women. The men are always on horseback,  or sleeping in their tents.    Each tribe has its central camping-place, to which they return at  intervals after perhaps wandering for months, a certain number of  persons being left at home to defend it. These camps are often situated  in inaccessible positions, and well protected by stockades. The  territory which is acknowledged to belong to such a camp is extremely  limited; its mere environs only are considered the actual property of  the tribe, and a second can pitch its tents with a few hundred yards.  These stockades, in fact, are more like store-houses than residences;  each is a mere rendezvous.    The gipsies are everywhere, but their stockades are most numerous in the  south, along the sides of the green hills and plains, and especially  round Stonehenge, where, on the great open plains, among the huge  boulders, placed ages since in circles, they perform strange ceremonies  and incantations. They attack every traveller, and every caravan or  train of waggons which they feel strong enough to master, but they do  not murder the solitary sleeping hunter or shepherd like the Bushmen.  They will, indeed, steal from him, but do not kill, except in fight.  Once, now and then, they have found their way into towns, when terrible  massacres have followed, for, when excited, the savage knows not how to  restrain himself.    Vengeance is their idol. If any community has injured or affronted them,  they never cease endeavouring to retaliate, and will wipe it out in fire  and blood generations afterwards. There are towns which have thus been  suddenly harried when the citizens had forgotten that any cause of  enmity existed. Vengeance is their religion and their social law, which  guides all their actions among themselves. It is for this reason that  they are continually at war, duke with duke, and king with king. A  deadly feud, too, has set Bushman and gipsy at each other's throat, far  beyond the memory of man. The Romany looks on the Bushman as a dog, and  slaughters him as such. In turn, the despised human dog slinks in the  darkness of the night into the Romany's tent, and stabs his daughter or  his wife, for such is the meanness and cowardice of the Bushman that he  would always rather kill a woman than a man.    There is also a third class of men who are not true gipsies, but have  something of their character, though the gipsies will not allow that  they were originally half-breeds. Their habits are much the same, except  that they are foot men and rarely use horses, and are therefore called  the foot gipsies. The gipsy horse is really a pony. Once only have the  Romany combined to attack the house people, driven, like the Bushmen, by  an exceedingly severe winter, against which they had no provision.    But, then, instead of massing their forces and throwing their  irresistible numbers upon one city or territory, all they would agree to  do was that, upon a certain day, each tribe should invade the land  nearest to it. The result was that they were, though with trouble,  repulsed. Until lately, no leader ventured to follow the gipsies to  their strongholds, for they were reputed invincible behind their  stockades. By infesting the woods and lying in ambush they rendered  communication between city and city difficult and dangerous, except to  bodies of armed men, and every waggon had to be defended by troops.    The gipsies, as they roam, make little secret of their presence (unless,  of course, intent upon mischief), but light their fires by day and night  fearlessly. The Bushmen never light a fire by day, lest the ascending  smoke, which cannot be concealed, should betray their whereabouts. Their  fires are lit at night in hollows or places well surrounded with  thickets, and, that the flame may not be seen, they will build screens  of fir boughs or fern. When they have obtained a good supply of hot wood  coals, no more sticks are thrown on, but these are covered with turf,  and thus kept in long enough for their purposes. Much of their meat they  devour raw, and thus do not need a fire so frequently as others.
