Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer  Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.  \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee  Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!\"                                            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--  On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--  Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"                                            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!  By that Heaven that bends above, us--by that God we both adore--  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"                                            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    \"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting--  \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!  Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"                                            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,  And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor                                            Shall be lifted--nevermore!

It was said that some of  the members of the club were faithful in attendance more by reason of  Mrs. Mifflin's chocolate cake, and the cask of cider that her brother  Andrew McGill sent down from the Sabine Farm every autumn, than on  account of the bookish conversation.    Roger spent the morning in doing a little housecleaning, in preparation  for his wife's return.  He was a trifle abashed to find how many  mingled crumbs and tobacco cinders had accumulated on the dining-room  rug.  He cooked himself a modest lunch of lamb chops and baked  potatoes, and was pleased by an epigram concerning food that came into  his mind.  \"It's not the food you dream about that matters,\" he said to  himself; \"it's the vittles that walk right in and become a member of  the family.\" He felt that this needed a little polishing and  rephrasing, but that there was a germ of wit in it.  He had a habit of  encountering ideas at his solitary meals.    After this, he was busy at the sink scrubbing the dishes, when he was  surprised by feeling two very competent arms surround him, and a pink  gingham apron was thrown over his head.  \"Mifflin,\" said his wife, \"how  many times have I told you to put on an apron when you wash up!\"    They greeted each other with the hearty, affectionate simplicity of  those congenially wedded in middle age.  Helen Mifflin was a buxom,  healthy creature, rich in good sense and good humour, well nourished  both in mind and body.  She kissed Roger's bald head, tied the apron  around his shrimpish person, and sat down on a kitchen chair to watch  him finish wiping the china.  Her cheeks were cool and ruddy from the  keen air, her face lit with the tranquil satisfaction of those who have  sojourned in the comfortable city of Boston.    \"Well, my dear,\" said Roger, \"this makes it a real Thanksgiving.  You  look as plump and full of matter as The Home Book of Verse.\"    \"I've had a stunning time,\" she said, patting Bock who stood at her  knee, imbibing the familiar and mysterious fragrance by which dogs  identify their human friends.  \"I haven't even heard of a book for  three weeks.  I did stop in at the Old Angle Book Shop yesterday, just  to say hullo to Joe Jillings.  He says all booksellers are crazy, but  that you are the craziest of the lot.  He wants to know if you're  bankrupt yet.\"    Roger's slate-blue eyes twinkled.  He hung up a cup in the china closet  and lit his pipe before replying.    \"What did you say?\"    \"I said that our shop was haunted, and mustn't be supposed to come  under the usual conditions of the trade.\"    \"Bully for you!  And what did Joe say to that?\"    \"'Haunted by the nuts!'\"    \"Well,\" said Roger, \"when literature goes bankrupt I'm willing to go  with it.  Not till then.  But by the way, we're going to be haunted by  a beauteous damsel pretty soon.  You remember my telling you that Mr.  Chapman wants to send his daughter to work in the shop?  Well, here's a  letter I had from him this morning.\"    He rummaged in his pocket, and produced the following, which Mrs.  Mifflin read:      DEAR MR.  MIFFLIN,    I am so delighted that you and Mrs. Mifflin are willing to try the  experiment of taking my daughter as an apprentice.  Titania is really a  very charming girl, and if only we can get some of the \"finishing  school\" nonsense out of her head she will make a fine woman.  She has  had (it was my fault, not hers) the disadvantage of being brought up,  or rather brought down, by having every possible want and whim  gratified.  Out of kindness for herself and her future husband, if she  should have one, I want her to learn a little about earning a living.  She is nearly nineteen, and I told her if she would try the bookshop  job for a while I would take her to Europe for a year afterward.    As I explained to you, I want her to think she is really earning her  way.  Of course I don't want the routine to be too hard for her, but I  do want her to get some idea of what it means to face life on one's  own.  If you will pay her ten dollars a week as a beginner, and deduct  her board from that, I will pay you twenty dollars a week, privately,  for your responsibility in caring for her and keeping your and Mrs.  Mifflin's friendly eyes on her.  I'm coming round to the Corn Cob  meeting to-morrow night, and we can make the final arrangements.    Luckily, she is very fond of books, and I really think she is looking  forward to the adventure with much anticipation.  I overheard her  saying to one of her friends yesterday that she was going to do some  \"literary work\" this winter.  That's the kind of nonsense I want her to  outgrow.  When I hear her say that she's got a job in a bookstore, I'll  know she's cured.                                       Cordially yours,                                           GEORGE CHAPMAN.      \"Well?\" said Roger, as Mrs. Mifflin made no comment.  \"Don't you think  it will be rather interesting to get a naive young girl's reactions  toward the problems of our tranquil existence?\"    \"Roger, you blessed innocent!\" cried his wife.  \"Life will no longer be  tranquil with a girl of nineteen round the place.  You may fool  yourself, but you can't fool me.  A girl of nineteen doesn't REACT  toward things.  She explodes.  Things don't 'react' anywhere but in  Boston and in chemical laboratories.  I suppose you know you're taking  a human bombshell into the arsenal?\"    Roger looked dubious.  \"I remember something in Weir of Hermiston about  a girl being 'an explosive engine,'\" he said.  \"But I don't see that  she can do any very great harm round here.  We're both pretty well  proof against shell shock.  The worst that could happen would be if she  got hold of my private copy of Fireside Conversation in the Age of  Queen Elizabeth.  Remind me to lock it up somewhere, will you?\"    This secret masterpiece by Mark Twain was one of the bookseller's  treasures.  Not even Helen had ever been permitted to read it; and she  had shrewdly judged that it was not in her line, for though she knew  perfectly well where he kept it (together with his life insurance  policy, some Liberty Bonds, an autograph letter from Charles Spencer  Chaplin, and a snapshot of herself taken on their honeymoon) she had  never made any attempt to examine it.    \"Well,\" said Helen; \"Titania or no Titania, if the Corn Cobs want their  chocolate cake to-night, I must get busy.  Take my suitcase upstairs  like a good fellow.\"      A gathering of booksellers is a pleasant sanhedrim to attend.  The  members of this ancient craft bear mannerisms and earmarks just as  definitely recognizable as those of the cloak and suit business or any  other trade.  They are likely to be a little--shall we say--worn at the  bindings, as becomes men who have forsaken worldly profit to pursue a  noble calling ill rewarded in cash.  They are possibly a trifle  embittered, which is an excellent demeanour for mankind in the face of  inscrutable heaven.  Long experience with publishers' salesmen makes  them suspicious of books praised between the courses of a heavy meal.    When a publisher's salesman takes you out to dinner, it is not  surprising if the conversation turns toward literature about the time  the last of the peas are being harried about the plate.  But, as Jerry  Gladfist says (he runs a shop up on Thirty-Eighth Street) the  publishers' salesmen supply a long-felt want, for they do now and then  buy one a dinner the like of which no bookseller would otherwise be  likely to commit.    \"Well, gentlemen,\" said Roger as his guests assembled in his little  cabinet, \"it's a cold evening.  Pull up toward the fire.  Make free  with the cider.  The cake's on the table.  My wife came back from  Boston specially to make it.\"    \"Here's Mrs. Mifflin's health!\" said Mr. Chapman, a quiet little man  who had a habit of listening to what he heard.  \"I hope she doesn't  mind keeping the shop while we celebrate?\"    \"Not a bit,\" said Roger.  \"She enjoys it.\"    \"I see Tarzan of the Apes is running at the Gissing Street movie  palace,\" said Gladfist.  \"Great stuff.  Have you seen it?\"    \"Not while I can still read The Jungle Book,\" said Roger.    \"You make me tired with that talk about literature,\" cried Jerry.  \"A  book's a book, even if Harold Bell Wright wrote it.\"    \"A book's a book if you enjoy reading it,\" amended Meredith, from a big  Fifth Avenue bookstore.  \"Lots of people enjoy Harold Bell Wright just  as lots of people enjoy tripe.  Either of them would kill me.  But  let's be tolerant.\"    \"Your argument is a whole succession of non sequiturs,\" said Jerry,  stimulated by the cider to unusual brilliance.    \"That's a long putt,\" chuckled Benson, the dealer in rare books and  first editions.    \"What I mean is this,\" said Jerry.  \"We aren't literary critics.  It's  none of our business to say what's good and what isn't.  Our job is  simply to supply the public with the books it wants when it wants them.  How it comes to want the books it does is no concern of ours.\"    \"You're the guy that calls bookselling the worst business in the  world,\" said Roger warmly, \"and you're the kind of guy that makes it  so.  I suppose you would say that it is no concern of the bookseller to  try to increase the public appetite for books?\"    \"Appetite is too strong a word,\" said Jerry.  \"As far as books are  concerned the public is barely able to sit up and take a little liquid  nourishment.  Solid foods don't interest it.  If you try to cram roast  beef down the gullet of an invalid you'll kill him.  Let the public  alone, and thank God when it comes round to amputate any of its  hard-earned cash.\"    \"Well, take it on the lowest basis,\" said Roger.  \"I haven't any facts  to go upon----\"    \"You never have,\" interjected Jerry.    \"But I'd like to bet that the Trade has made more money out of Bryce's  American Commonwealth than it ever did out of all Parson Wright's books  put"]]]
