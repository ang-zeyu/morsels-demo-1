The economy    rebounded in 1993 after a severe depression accompanying the collapse    of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and 1991.    Stabilization policies, including public sector layoffs and reduced    social services, have improved the government's fiscal situation and    reduced inflation. The recovery was spurred by the remittances of some    5% of the population which works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy.    Foreign assistance and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery.    Most agricultural land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving    peasant incomes. Albania's limited industrial sector, now less than    one-sixth of GDP, continued to decline in 1993. A sharp fall in    chromium prices reduced hard currency receipts from the mining sector.    Large segments of the population, especially those living in urban    areas, continue to depend on humanitarian aid to meet basic food    requirements. Unemployment remains a severe problem accounting for    approximately one-fifth of the work force. Growth is expected to    continue in 1994, but could falter if Albania becomes involved in the    conflict in the former Yugoslavia, workers' remittances from Greece    are reduced, or foreign assistance declines.

When we remember that the Maya nations practised the custom of  artificially deforming the skull, as is seen in particular on the reliefs  at Palenque, we may also regard the heads of these deities as  representations of such artificially flattened skulls.    God E occurs frequently as the god of husbandry, especially in the Madrid  manuscript, which devotes much attention to agriculture. He seems to be a  counterpart of the Mexican maize-god Centeotl. The passages in the Madrid  manuscript (Tro. 29a and Cort. 39a, 40a) are very remarkable, where  the deity E is represented in the position of a woman in labor with  numerals on the abdomen; perhaps the underlying idea is that of  fruitfulness.    In the Codex Cort., p. 40, this grain-deity is pictured with a tall and  slender vessel before him, which he holds in his hands. It is possible  that this is meant to suggest a grain receptacle; to be sure, in the same  place, other figures of gods likewise have such vessels in their hands.  At any rate, it is interesting to note that in the passage already  mentioned (Dr. 50a) god E also holds a similar tall and slender vessel  in his hands.    According to all appearances the scene pictured in Dr. 50a has reference  to the conflict of the grain-god with a death-deity. The latter, the  figure sitting on the right, is characterized by a skull as a head  ornament (see Fig. 6) and seems to address threats or commands to god E,  who stands before him in the attitude of a terrified and cowed  individual.    Furthermore god E has nothing to do with the powers of the underworld; he  is a god of life, of prosperity and fruitfulness; symbols of death are  never found in connection with him. Brinton calls this god Ghanan,  equivalent to Kan; it is possible, too, that he is identical with a deity  Yum Kaax who has been handed down to us and whose name means \"Lord of the  harvest fields\".    According to Foerstemann the day dedicated to this god is Kan.      F. The God of War and of Human Sacrifices.    [Illustration: Figs. 28-34]    This is a deity closely related to the death-god A, resembling the Aztec  Xipe, and may, I think, without hesitation be regarded simply as the god  of human sacrifice, perhaps, even more generally, as the god of death by  violence. His hieroglyph is Figs. 28-30; it contains the number 11. A  variant of this occurs on Dr. 7b, where instead of the 11 there is the  following sign: [Hieroglyph]    The characteristic mark of god F is a single black line usually running  perpendicularly down the face in the vicinity of the eye. This line  should be distinguished from the parallel lines of C's face and from the  line, which, as a continuation of god E's head resembling an ear of  maize, frequently appears on his face, especially as in the variants of  the Madrid manuscript (compare Figs. 25-27). These pictures of E can  always be unfailingly recognized by the peculiar shape of the head and  should be distinguished from those representing F. The black face-line is  the distinguishing mark of god F, just as it is of the Aztec Xipe. It  sometimes runs in a curve over the cheek as a thick, black stripe, as  Cort. 42. Sometimes it encircles the eye only (Dr. 6a) and again it is a  dotted double line (Dr. 6b). The hieroglyph of god F likewise exhibits  this line and with the very same variants as the god himself. See the  hieroglyphs of the god belonging to the pictures in Dr. 6a, 1st and 3d  figures, in which the line likewise differs from the other forms (Figs.  30-34).    In a few places god F is pictured with the same black lines _on his  entire body_, which elsewhere he has only on his face, the lines being  like those in Fig. 31, namely Tro. 27*c. Indeed, in Tro. 28*c, the  death-god A likewise has these black lines on his body and also F's line  on his face; a clear proof of the close relationship of the two deities.  These lines probably signify gaping death-wounds and the accompanying  rows of dots are intended to represent the blood.    Since god F is a death-deity the familiar sign (Fig. 5), which occurs so  frequently with the hieroglyphs of A, also belongs to his symbols. F is  pictured in company with the death-god in connection with human sacrifice  (Cort. 42); an exactly similar picture of the two gods of human sacrifice  is given in Codex Tro. 30d; here, too, they sit opposite one another.  The identity of this attendant of death with the deity, designated by the  hieroglyph with the numeral 11, is proved by the following passages:  Tro. 19, bottom (on the extreme right hand without picture, only  hieroglyph, see Fig. 29), Dr. 5b, 6a, b, and c and many others. In  some of the passages cited (Dr. 5a and b) he is distinguished by an  unusually large ear-peg. His hieroglyph occurs with the hieroglyph of the  death-god in Dr. 6c, where he is himself not pictured.    As war-god, god F occurs combined with the death-god in the passages  mentioned above (Tro. 27*-29*c), where he sets the houses on fire with  his torch and demolishes them with his spear.    God F occurs quite frequently in the manuscripts and must therefore be  considered as one of the more important deities.    According to Foerstemann his day is Manik, the seizing, grasping hand,  symbolizing the capturing of an enemy in war for sacrificial purposes.    F's sign occurs once, as mentioned above, in fourfold repetition with all  the four cardinal points, namely in Tro. 29*c. In ancient Central  America the captured enemy was sacrificed and thus the conceptions of the  war-god and of the god of death by violence and by human sacrifice are  united in the figure of god F. In this character god F occurs several  times in the Madrid manuscript in combat with M, the god of travelling  merchants (see page 35). Spanish writers do not mention a deity of the  kind described here as belonging to the Maya pantheon.      G. The Sun-God.    [Illustration: Figs. 35-36]    God G's hieroglyph (Fig. 35) contains as its chief factor the sun-sign  Kin. It is one of the signs (of which there are about 12 in the  manuscripts), which has the Ben-ik prefix and doubtless denotes a month  dedicated to the sun. There is, I think, no difference of opinion  regarding the significance of this deity, although Fewkes, as already  stated, is inclined to identify G with B, whom, it is true, the former  resembles. It is surprising that a deity who from his nature must be  considered as very important, is represented with such comparative  infrequency. He occurs only a few times in the Dresden manuscript, for  example 22b, 11c, and in the Codex Tro.-Cortesianus none can be found  among the figures which could be safely regarded as the sun-god; in no  manuscript except the Dresden does a deity occur wearing the sun-sign Kin  on his body. But once in the Codex Cort. the figure of D appears with the  sun-sign on his head, as pointed out by Fewkes in his article entitled  \"The God 'D' in the Codex Cortesianus\". G's hieroglyph, to be sure, is  found repeatedly in the Madrid manuscript, for example Codex Tro. 31c.    God G seems to be not wholly without relation to the powers of death; the  owl-sign (Fig. 5) occurs once in connection with him (Dr. 11c). Besides  the sun-sign Kin, which the god bears on his body, his representations  are distinguished by a peculiar nose ornament (Fig. 36) which, as may be  seen by comparison with other similar pictures in the Dresden manuscript,  is nothing but a large and especially elaborate nose-peg. Similar  ornaments are rather common just here in the carefully drawn first part  of the Dresden manuscript. Compare Dr. 22b (middle figure), 21 (centre),  17b, 14a, b; occasionally they also have the shape of a flower, for  example 12b (centre), 11c (left), 19a. Lastly it is worthy of note,  that god G is sometimes represented with a snake-like tongue protruding  from his mouth, as in Dr. 11b and c.      H. The Chicchan-God.    [Illustration: Figs. 37-40]    The figure of a deity of frequent occurrence in the Dresden manuscript is  a god, who is characterized by a skin-spot or a scale of a serpent on his  temple of the same shape as the hieroglyph of the day Chicchan (serpent).  Moreover the representations of the god himself differ very much, so that  there are almost no other positive, unvarying characteristic marks to be  specified. His picture is plainly recognizable and has the Chicchan-mark  on the temple in Dr. 11a, 12b and 20b.    The hieroglyph belonging to this deity likewise displays the  Chicchan-sign as its distinguishing mark. Furthermore several variants  occur. The Chicchan-sign has sometimes the form of Fig. 37 and again that  of Fig. 38. The prefix likewise differs very much, having sometimes the  form of Fig. 37, and again that of Fig. 38 or of Figs. 39 and 40. Thus  there are, in all, four different forms of the prefix. It is to be  assumed that all these hieroglyphs have the same meaning, notwithstanding  their variations. Taking into consideration the frequency of the  variations of other hieroglyphs of gods and of the hieroglyphs in the  Maya manuscripts in general, it is quite improbable from the nature of  the case, that a hieroglyph, which displays so great an agreement in its  essential and characteristic elements, should denote several different  gods. The dissimilarity which Seler thinks he finds between the forms of  the Chicchan-sign in Figs. 37 and 38 and which leads him to assume that  Fig. 37 is not a Chicchan-sign at all, but that it denotes another face  ornament, cannot be satisfactorily proved, and must be regarded as an  arbitrary assumption. The Chicchan-mark in the sign of the day Chicchan  also differs very much from that on the bodies of the serpents pictured  in the manuuscripts, so that variations of this kind by no means make it  necessary to assume that the hieroglyphs actually denote different  things. Observe, for example, the different Chicchan-spots on the"]]]
