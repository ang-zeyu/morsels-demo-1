Commodore Dewey felt that the first duty of an officer is to obey, and  after a farewell dinner given by his friends at the Metropolitan Club in  Arlington, he hurriedly completed his preparations, and, starting for  Hong Kong, duly reached that port, where, on January 3, 1898, he hoisted  his flag on the _Olympia_.    The official records show that the _Olympia_ was ordered home, but  Roosevelt, in a confidential dispatch of February 25, directed Commodore  Dewey to remain, to prepare his squadron for offensive operations, and,  as soon as war broke out with Spain, to steam to the Philippines and hit  the enemy as hard as he knew how. Meanwhile ammunition and supplies were  hurried across the continent to San Francisco as fast as express trains  could carry them, and were sent thence by steamer to Hong Kong, where  they were eagerly received by the waiting Commodore.    Reverting to those stirring days, it will be recalled that the Queen  Regent of Spain declared war against the United States on April 24,  1898, to which we replied that war had begun three days earlier, when  the Madrid government dismissed our minister and handed him his  passports. Then followed, or rather were continued, the vigorous  preparations on the part of our authorities for the prosecution of the  war to a prompt and decisive end.    Commodore Dewey's squadron lay at anchor in the harbor of Hong Kong,  awaiting the momentous news from Washington. When it reached the  commander it was accompanied by an order to capture or destroy the  enemy's fleet at Manila. Almost at the same time Great Britain issued  her proclamation of neutrality, the terms of which compelled Dewey to  leave the British port of Hong Kong within twenty-four hours. He did so,  steaming to Mirs Bay, a Chinese port near at hand, where he completed  his preparations for battle, and on the 27th of April steamed out of the  harbor on his way to Manila.    The city of Manila, with a population numbering about a quarter of a  million, lies on the western side of Luzon, the principal island, with a  magnificent bay in front, extensive enough to permit all the navies of  the world to manoeuvre with plenty of elbow room. The entrance to the  immense bay is seven miles wide and contains two islands, Corregidor and  Caballo, both of which were powerfully fortified, the works containing a  number of modern guns. Torpedoes were stretched across the channel and  the bay abounded with enough mines and torpedoes, it would seem, to blow  any fleet of ironclads to atoms as soon as it dared to try to force an  entrance into the waters. Some twenty miles beyond lay the city of  Manila, and about ten miles to the south was Cavite, constituting the  strongly fortified part of the city proper.    Of course the Spanish spies were on the watch in Hong Kong, and while  the American squadron was steaming out of the bay the news was  telegraphed to the authorities at Manila, who knew that the real  destination of the enemy was that city. Every effort was made to keep  the matter a secret, but it was impossible, and it soon became known to  everybody that the American \"pigs\" were coming, and that Manila must  fall, if the Spanish fleet were unable to beat off the enemy.    The Spaniards proclaimed that they would send every one of the American  vessels to the bottom; but they had made similar boasts before, and  their bombast did not quiet the fears of the people, among whom a panic  quickly spread. Those who were able to do so gathered their valuables  and took refuge on the merchant ships in the harbor and thanked heaven  when they bore them away. Many others fled from the city, but the  majority stayed, grimly determined to be in at the death and accept  whatever fate was in store for them.    The distance between Hong Kong and Manila is 630 miles, and it needed  only a little figuring on the part of the inhabitants to decide that the  dreaded squadron would be due on the following Saturday evening or early  the next morning, which would be the first of May. The self-confidence  of Admiral Montojo and his officers was almost sublime. All they asked  was a fair chance at the \"American pigs.\" They hoped that nothing would  occur to prevent the coming of the fleet, for the Spaniards would never  cease to mourn if the golden opportunity were allowed to slip from their  grasp. They were not disappointed in that respect.    It is proper to give at this point the respective strength of the  American and Spanish fleets.

Gunboat _Marquis Del Duero_, built in 1875, iron, 500 tons, 10 knots,  and mounting one 6.2-inch and two 4.7-inch rifles.           *       *       *       *       *    Through the bright sunshine and when the stars twinkled in the sky or  the full moon rode overhead, the American ships steamed to the southeast  across the heaving China Sea. The Stars and Stripes fluttered in the  breeze and there was a feeling of expectancy on board the grim engines  of war, that had laid aside every possible encumbrance, and like  prize-fighters were stripped to the buff and eager for battle.    The run was a smooth one, and as the sun was sinking in the sky  Commodore Dewey, peering through his glass, caught the faint outlines of  Corregidor Island, and dimly beyond the flickering haze revealed the  Spanish fleet in the calm bay. The Commodore had been in that part of  the world before, and while waiting at Hong Kong had gathered all the  knowledge possible of the defences of Manila. He knew the fort was  powerfully fortified and the bay mined, and knowing all this, he  remembered the exclamation of his immortal instructor in the science of  war, the peerless Farragut, when he was driving his squadron into Mobile  Bay. Recalling that occurrence, Commodore Dewey joined in spirit in  repeating the words:    \"D---- the torpedoes!\"    It was still many miles to the entrance, and night closed in while the  squadron was ploughing through the sea that broke in tumbling foam at  the bows and spread far away in snowy wakes at the rear. All lights were  put out, the full moon again climbed the sky and the shadowy leviathans  plunged through the waters straight for the opening of the bay, guarded  by the fort and batteries, with the Spanish fleet beyond, defiantly  awaiting the coming of the American squadron.    Suddenly from Corregidor Island the darkness was lit up by a vivid  flash, a thunderous boom traveled across the bay, and the heavy shot  tore its way screaming over the _Raleigh_, quickly followed by a second,  which fell astern of the _Olympia_ and _Raleigh_. The Spaniards had  discovered the approach of the squadron. The _Raleigh_, _Concord_, and  _Boston_ replied; all the shots being fired with remarkable accuracy.    One may imagine the consternation in Manila when the boom of those guns  rolled in from the bay, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#5)"],[1,"say?' 'Yes.' 'But Protagoras will retort:  \"Can anything be more or less without addition or subtraction?\"'    'I should say \"No\" if I were not afraid of contradicting my former  answer.'    'And if you say \"Yes,\" the tongue will escape conviction but not the  mind, as Euripides would say?' 'True.' 'The thoroughbred Sophists, who  know all that can be known, would have a sparring match over this, but  you and I, who have no professional pride, want only to discover whether  our ideas are clear and consistent. And we cannot be wrong in saying,  first, that nothing can be greater or less while remaining equal;  secondly, that there can be no becoming greater or less without addition  or subtraction; thirdly, that what is and was not, cannot be without  having become. But then how is this reconcilable with the case of the  dice, and with similar examples?--that is the question.' 'I am often  perplexed and amazed, Socrates, by these difficulties.' 'That is because  you are a philosopher, for philosophy begins in wonder, and Iris is  the child of Thaumas. Do you know the original principle on which the  doctrine of Protagoras is based?' 'No.' 'Then I will tell you; but we  must not let the uninitiated hear, and by the uninitiated I mean the  obstinate people who believe in nothing which they cannot hold in their  hands. The brethren whose mysteries I am about to unfold to you are far  more ingenious. They maintain that all is motion; and that motion  has two forms, action and passion, out of which endless phenomena are  created, also in two forms--sense and the object of sense--which come to  the birth together. There are two kinds of motions, a slow and a fast;  the motions of the agent and the patient are slower, because they move  and create in and about themselves, but the things which are born of  them have a swifter motion, and pass rapidly from place to place.  The eye and the appropriate object come together, and give birth to  whiteness and the sensation of whiteness; the eye is filled with seeing,  and becomes not sight but a seeing eye, and the object is filled with  whiteness, and becomes not whiteness but white; and no other compound of  either with another would have produced the same effect. All sensation  is to be resolved into a similar combination of an agent and patient.  Of either, taken separately, no idea can be formed; and the agent may  become a patient, and the patient an agent. Hence there arises a general  reflection that nothing is, but all things become; no name can detain or  fix them. Are not these speculations charming, Theaetetus, and very good  for a person in your interesting situation? I am offering you specimens  of other men's wisdom, because I have no wisdom of my own, and I want  to deliver you of something; and presently we will see whether you  have brought forth wind or not. Tell me, then, what do you think of the  notion that \"All things are becoming\"?'    'When I hear your arguments, I am marvellously ready to assent.'    'But I ought not to conceal from you that there is a serious objection  which may be urged against this doctrine of Protagoras. For there are  states, such as madness and dreaming, in which perception is false; and  half our life is spent in dreaming; and who can say that at this instant  we are not dreaming? Even the fancies of madmen are real at the time.  But if knowledge is perception, how can we distinguish between the true  and the false in such cases? Having stated the objection, I will now  state the answer. Protagoras would deny the continuity of phenomena;  he would say that what is different is entirely different, and whether  active or passive has a different power. There are infinite agents and  patients in the world, and these produce in every combination of them a  different perception. Take myself as an instance:--Socrates may be ill  or he may be well,--and remember that Socrates, with all his accidents,  is spoken of. The wine which I drink when I am well is pleasant to  me, but the same wine is unpleasant to me when I am ill. And there  is nothing else from which I can receive the same impression, nor can  another receive the same impression from the wine. Neither can I and the  object of sense become separately what we become together. For the one  in becoming is relative to the other, but they have no other relation;  and the combination of them is absolute at each moment. (In modern  language, the act of sensation is really indivisible, though capable of  a mental analysis into subject and object.) My sensation alone is true,  and true to me only. And therefore, as Protagoras says, \"To myself I  am the judge of what is and what is not.\" Thus the flux of Homer and  Heracleitus, the great Protagorean saying that \"Man is the measure of  all things,\" the doctrine of Theaetetus that \"Knowledge is perception,\"  have all the same meaning. And this is thy new-born child, which by my  art I have brought to light; and you must not be angry if instead of  rearing your infant we expose him.'    'Theaetetus will not be angry,' says Theodorus; 'he is very  good-natured. But I should like to know, Socrates, whether you mean to  say that all this is untrue?'    'First reminding you that I am not the bag which contains the arguments,  but that I extract them from Theaetetus, shall I tell you what amazes me  in your friend Protagoras?'    'What may that be?'    'I like his doctrine that what appears is; but I wonder that he did  not begin his great work on Truth with a declaration that a pig, or a  dog-faced baboon, or any other monster which has sensation, is a measure  of all things; then, while we were reverencing him as a god, he might  have produced a magnificent effect by expounding to us that he was no  wiser than a tadpole. For if sensations are always true, and one man's  discernment is as good as another's, and every man is his own judge,  and everything that he judges is right and true, then what need of  Protagoras to be our instructor at a high figure; and why should we  be less knowing than he is, or have to go to him, if every man is the  measure of all things? My own art of midwifery, and all dialectic, is  an enormous folly, if Protagoras' \"Truth\" be indeed truth, and the  philosopher is not merely amusing himself by giving oracles out of his  book.'    Theodorus thinks that Socrates is unjust to his master, Protagoras; but  he is too old and stiff to try a fall with him, and therefore refers him  to Theaetetus, who is already driven out of his former opinion by the  arguments of Socrates.    Socrates then takes up the defence of Protagoras, who is supposed to  reply in his own person--'Good people, you sit and declaim about the  gods, of whose existence or non-existence I have nothing to say, or you  discourse about man being reduced to the level of the brutes; but what  proof have you of your statements? And yet surely you and Theodorus had  better reflect whether probability is a safe guide. Theodorus would be  a bad geometrician if he had nothing better to offer.'...Theaetetus is  affected by the appeal to geometry, and Socrates is induced by him to  put the question in a new form. He proceeds as follows:--'Should we say  that we know what we see and hear,--e.g. the sound of words or the sight  of letters in a foreign tongue?'    'We should say that the figures of the letters, and the pitch of the  voice in uttering them, were known to us, but not the meaning of them.'    'Excellent; I want you to grow, and therefore I will leave that answer  and ask another question: Is not seeing perceiving?' 'Very true.' 'And  he who sees knows?' 'Yes.' 'And he who remembers, remembers that which  he sees and knows?' 'Very true.' 'But if he closes his eyes, does he not  remember?' 'He does.' 'Then he may remember and not see; and if seeing  is knowing, he may remember and not know. Is not this a \"reductio ad  absurdum\" of the hypothesis that knowledge is sensible perception? Yet  perhaps we are crowing too soon; and if Protagoras, \"the father of the  myth,\" had been alive, the result might have been very different. But he  is dead, and Theodorus, whom he left guardian of his \"orphan,\" has not  been very zealous in defending him.'    Theodorus objects that Callias is the true guardian, but he hopes that  Socrates will come to the rescue. Socrates prefaces his defence by  resuming the attack. He asks whether a man can know and not know at the  same time? 'Impossible.' Quite possible, if you maintain that seeing is  knowing. The confident adversary, suiting the action to the word, shuts  one of your eyes; and now, says he, you see and do not see, but do  you know and not know? And a fresh opponent darts from his ambush, and  transfers to knowledge the terms which are commonly applied to sight.  He asks whether you can know near and not at a distance; whether you can  have a sharp and also a dull knowledge. While you are wondering at his  incomparable wisdom, he gets you into his power, and you will not escape  until you have come to an understanding with him about the money which  is to be paid for your release.    But Protagoras has not yet made his defence; and already he may be heard  contemptuously replying that he is not responsible for the admissions  which were made by a boy, who could not foresee the coming move, and  therefore had answered in a manner which enabled Socrates to raise a  laugh against himself. 'But I cannot be fairly charged,' he will say,  'with an answer which I should not have given; for I never maintained  that the memory of a feeling is the same as a feeling, or denied that a  man might know and not know the same thing at the same time. Or, if you  will have extreme precision, I say that man in different relations is  many or rather infinite in number. And I challenge you, either to show  that his perceptions are not individual, or that if they are, what  appears to him is not what is. As to your pigs and"]]]
