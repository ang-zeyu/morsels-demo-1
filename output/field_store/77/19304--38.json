By the glare of the bluish searchlights which were spreading a livid  clearness over the sea, began the unloading of passengers and baggage  for Paris, from the transatlantic into the tenders. \"Hurry! Hurry!\" The  seamen were pushing forward the ladies of slow step who were recounting  their valises, believing that they had lost some. The stewards loaded  themselves up with babies as though they were bundles. The general  precipitation dissipated the usual exaggerated and oily Teutonic  amiability. \"They are regular bootlickers,\" thought Desnoyers. \"They  believe that their hour of triumph has come, and do not think it  necessary to pretend any longer.\" . . .    He was soon in a launch that was bobbing up and down on the waves  near the black and immovable hulk of the great liner, dotted with many  circles of light and filled with people waving handkerchiefs. Julio  recognized Bertha who was waving her hand without seeing him, without  knowing in which tender he was, but feeling obliged to show her  gratefulness for the sweet memories that now were being lost in the  mystery of the sea and the night. \"Adieu, Frau Rath!\"    The distance between the departing transatlantic and the lighters was  widening. As though it had been awaiting this moment with impunity, a  stentorian voice on the upper deck shouted with a noisy guffaw, \"See you  later! Soon we shall meet you in Paris!\" And the marine band, the very  same band that three days before had astonished Desnoyers with its  unexpected Marseillaise, burst forth into a military march of the time  of Frederick the Great--a march of grenadiers with an accompaniment of  trumpets.    That had been the night before. Although twenty-four hours had not yet  passed by, Desnoyers was already considering it as a distant event of  shadowy reality. His thoughts, always disposed to take the opposite  side, did not share in the general alarm. The insolence of the  Counsellor now appeared to him but the boastings of a burgher turned  into a soldier. The disquietude of the people of Paris, was but the  nervous agitation of a city which lived placidly and became alarmed at  the first hint of danger to its comfort. So many times they had spoken  of an immediate war, always settling things peacefully at the last  moment! . . . Furthermore he did not want war to come because it would  upset all his plans for the future; and the man accepted as logical  and reasonable everything that suited his selfishness, placing it above  reality.    \"No, there will not be war,\" he repeated as he continued pacing up and  down the garden. \"These people are beside themselves. How could a war  possibly break out in these days?\" . . .    And after disposing of his doubts, which certainly would in a short  time come up again, he thought of the joy of the moment, consulting his  watch. Five o'clock! She might come now at any minute! He thought that  he recognized her afar off in a lady who was passing through the grating  by the rue Pasquier. She seemed to him a little different, but it  occurred to him that possibly the Summer fashions might have altered  her appearance. But soon he saw that he had made a mistake. She was not  alone, another lady was with her. They were perhaps English or North  American women who worshipped the memory of Marie Antoinette and wished  to visit the Chapelle Expiatoire, the old tomb of the executed queen.  Julio watched them as they climbed the flights of steps and crossed the  interior patio in which were interred the eight hundred Swiss soldiers  killed in the attack of the Tenth of August, with other victims of  revolutionary fury.    Disgusted at his error, he continued his tramp. His ill humor made the  monument with which the Bourbon restoration had adorned the old cemetery  of the Madeleine, appear uglier than ever to him. Time was passing, but  she did not come. Every time that he turned, he looked hungrily at the  entrances of the garden. And then it happened as in all their meetings.  She suddenly appeared as if she had fallen from the sky or risen up from  the ground, like an apparition. A cough, a slight rustling of footsteps,  and as he turned, Julio almost collided with her.    \"Marguerite! Oh, Marguerite!\" . . .    It was she, and yet he was slow to recognize her. He felt a certain  strangeness in seeing in full reality the countenance which had occupied  his imagination for three months, each time more spirituelle and shadowy  with the idealism of absence. But his doubts were of short duration.  Then it seemed as though time and space were eliminated, that he had  not made any voyage, and but a few hours had intervened since their last  interview.    Marguerite divined the expansion which might follow Julio's  exclamations, the vehement hand-clasp, perhaps something more, so she  kept herself calm and serene.    \"No; not here,\" she said with a grimace of repugnance. \"What a  ridiculous idea for us to have met here!\"    They were about to seat themselves on the iron chairs, in the shadow of  some shrubbery, when she rose suddenly. Those who were passing along the  boulevard might see them by merely casting their eyes toward the  garden. At this time, many of her friends might be passing through the  neighborhood because of its proximity to the big shops. . . . They,  therefore, sought refuge at a corner of the monument, placing themselves  between it and the rue des Mathurins. Desnoyers brought two chairs near  the hedge, so that when seated they were invisible to those passing on  the other side of the railing. But this was not solitude. A few steps  away, a fat, nearsighted man was reading his paper, and a group of  women were chatting and embroidering. A woman with a red wig and two  dogs--some housekeeper who had come down into the garden in order to  give her pets an airing--passed several times near the amorous pair,  smiling discreetly.    \"How annoying!\" groaned Marguerite. \"Why did we ever come to this  place!\"    The two scrutinized each other carefully, wishing to see exactly what  transformation Time had wrought.    \"You are darker than ever,\" she said. \"You look like a man of the sea.\"    Julio was finding her even lovelier than before, and felt sure that  possessing her was well worth all the contrarieties which had brought  about his trip to South America. She was taller than he, with an  elegantly proportioned slenderness. \"She has the musical step,\"  Desnoyers had told himself, when seeing her in his imagination; and now,  on beholding her again, the first thing that he admired was her rhythmic  tread, light and graceful as she passed through the garden seeking  another seat. Her features were not regular but they had a piquant  fascination--a true Parisian face. Everything that had been invented for  the embellishment of feminine charm was used about her person with the  most exquisite fastidiousness. She had always lived for herself. Only  a few months before had she abdicated a part of this sweet selfishness,  sacrificing reunions, teas, and calls in order to give Desnoyers some of  the afternoon hours.    Stylish and painted like a priceless doll, with no loftier ambition  than to be a model, interpreting with personal elegance the latest  confections of the modistes, she was at last experiencing the same  preoccupations and joys as other women, creating for herself an inner  life. The nucleus of this new life, hidden under her former frivolity,  was Desnoyers. Just as she was imagining that she had reorganized  her existence--adjusting the satisfactions of worldly elegance to the  delights of love in intimate secrecy--a fulminating catastrophe (the  intervention of her husband whose possible appearance she seemed to  have overlooked) had disturbed her thoughtless happiness. She who was  accustomed to think herself the centre of the universe, imagining that  events ought to revolve around her desires and tastes, had suffered this  cruel surprise with more astonishment than grief.    \"And you, how do you think I look?\" Marguerite queried.    \"I must tell you that the fashion has changed. The sheath skirt has  passed away. Now it is worn short and with more fullness.\"    Desnoyers had to interest himself in her apparel with the same devotion,  mixing his appreciation of the latest freak of the fashion-monger with  his eulogies of Marguerite's beauty.    \"Have you thought much about me?\" she continued. \"You have not been  unfaithful to me a single time? Not even once? . . . Tell me the truth;  you know I can always tell when you are lying.\"    \"I have always thought of you,\" he said putting his hand on his heart,  as if he were swearing before a judge.    And he said it roundly, with an accent of truth, since in his  infidelities--now completely forgotten--the memory of Marguerite had  always been present.    \"But let us talk about you!\" added Julio. \"What have you been doing all  the time?\"    He had brought his chair nearer to hers, and their knees touched. He  took one of her hands, patting it and putting his finger in the glove  opening. Oh, that accursed garden which would not permit greater  intimacy and obliged them to speak in a low tone, after three months'  absence! . . . In spite of his discretion, the man who was reading his  paper raised his head and looked irritably at them over his spectacles  as though a fly were distracting him with its buzzing. . . . The very  idea of talking love-nonsense in a public garden when all Europe was  threatened with calamity!    Repelling the audacious hand, Marguerite spoke tranquilly of her  existence during the last months.    \"I have passed my life the best I could, but I have been greatly bored.  You know that I am now living with mama, and mama is a lady of the old  regime who does not understand our tastes. I have been to the theatres  with my brother. I have made many calls on the lawyer in order to learn  the progress of my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14866"],[0,"Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador (#5)"],[1,"of establishing would be a bagatelle. As a matter of fact, in spite of  all the bad bargains having always been on the Indian side when sales  and treaties were made with the whites, there is enough money to the  credit of the Indians in the hands of the Government to establish a  dozen hives and keep the people in them as idle as drones on the mere  interest of it. But good hunting grounds are better than good hives.    4. SPORT.--Sport should have a great future in Labrador. Inland game  birds, except ptarmigan, are the only kind of which there is never  likely to be a great abundance, owing to the natural scarcity of their  food. But, besides the big game on land and game birds on the coast,  there are some unusual forms of sport appealing to adventurous  natures. Harpooning the little white whale by hand in a North Shore  canoe, or shooting the largest and gamest of all the seals--the great  \"hood\"--also out of a canoe, requires enough skill and courage to make  success its own reward. The extension and enforcement of proper game  laws would benefit sport directly, while indirectly benefitting all  the other interests.    5. ZOOPHILISTS.--The zoophilist class seems only in place as an  afterthought. But I am convinced that it will soon become of at least  equal importance with any other. All the people, from zoologists to  tourists, who are drawn to such places by the attraction of seeing  animal life in its own surroundings, already form an immense class in  every community. And it is a rapidly increasing class. Could we do  posterity any greater injury than by destroying the ten Englands of  glorious wild life in Labrador, just at the very time when our own and  other publics are beginning to appreciate the value of the appeal  which such haunts of Nature make to all the highest faculties of  civilized man?    The way can be made clear by scientific study. The laws can be drawn  up by any intelligent legislators, and enforced quite as efficiently  as other laws have been by the Mounted Police in the North West. The  expense will be small, the benefits great and widely felt. The only  real hitch is the uninformed and therefore apathetic state of public  opinion. If people only knew that Labrador contained a hundred  Saguenays, wild zoos, Thousand Islands, fiords, palisades, sea  mountains, canons, great lakes and waterfalls, if they only knew that  they could get the enjoyment of it for a song, and make it an heirloom  for no more trouble than letting it live, they might do all that is  needed to-morrow. But they don't know. And the three Governments  cannot do much without the support of public opinion. At present they  do practically nothing. The Ungavan Labrador has neither organization  nor laws. The Newfoundland Labrador has organization but no laws. And  the Quebec Labrador has laws but no observance of them.    However, Quebec has laws, which are something, legislators who have  made the laws, and leaders who have introduced them. The trouble is  that the public generally has no sense of responsibility in the matter  of enforcement. It still has a hazy idea that Nature has an  overflowing sanctuary of her own, somewhere or other, which will fill  up the gaps automatically. The result is that poaching is commonly  regarded as a venial offence, poachers taken red-handed are rarely  punished, and willing ears are always lent to the cry that rich  sportsmen are trying to take the bread out of the poor settler's  mouth. The poor settler does not reflect that he himself, and all  other classes alike, really have a common interest in the conservation  of any wild life that does not conflict with legitimate human  development. There is some just cause of complaint that the big-game  reserves are hampering the peasants in parts of India and the settlers  and natives in parts of Uganda. But no such complaint can be raised  against the Laurentide National Park, so wisely established by the  Quebec Government. The worst of it is that many of the richer people  set the example in law-breaking. The numbers of big game allowed are  exceeded, out-of-season shooting goes on, and both out-of-season and  forbidden game is sold in the markets and served at the dinner tables  of the very class who should be first in protecting it.    Partly because Quebec has taken the lead in legislation, and partly  because an ideal site is ready to hand under its jurisdiction, I would  venture to suggest the immediate establishment of an absolute  sanctuary for all wild birds and mammals along as much of the coast as  possible on either side of cape Whittle. The best place of all to keep  is from cape Whittle eastward to cape Mekattina, 64 miles in a  straight line by sea. The 45 miles from cape Mekattina eastward to  Shekatika bay are probably the next best; and, next, the 35 from cape  Whittle westward to Cloudberry point. As there are 800 miles between  Quebec and the Strait, I am only proposing to make from one-tenth to  one-fifth of them into a sanctuary. And this part is the least fitted  for other purposes, except sea-fishing, which would not be restricted  at all, the least inhabited, and the most likely to succeed as a  sanctuary, especially for birds.    Cape Whittle is 550 miles below Quebec, 70 below Natashkwan, which is  the last port of call for the mail boats, and 50 below Kegashka, the  last green spot along the shore. It faces cape Gregory, near the bay  of Islands in Newfoundland, 130 miles across; and is almost as far  from the north-east point of Anticosti. It is a great landmark for  coasting vessels, and for the seal herds as well. A refuge for seals  is absolutely necessary to preserve their numbers and the business  connected with them. Of course, I know there is a feeling that, if  they are going to disappear, the best thing to do is to exploit them  to the utmost in the meanwhile, so as to snatch every present  advantage, regardless of consequences. But is this business, sense, or  conservation? Even if any restriction in the way of numbers, sex, age  or season should be imposed on seal hunting, a small sanctuary cannot  but be beneficial. While, if there is no other protection, a sanctuary  is a _sine qua non_. It is possible that some protection might also be  afforded to the whales that hug the shore.    The case of the birds is quite as strong, and the chance of protection  by this sanctuary much greater. With the exception of the limited  egging and shooting for the necessary food of the few residents--the  whole district of Mekattina contained only 213 people at the last  census--not an egg nor a bird should be touched at all. The birds soon  find out where they are well off, and their increase will recruit the  whole river and gulf. A few outlying bird sanctuaries should be  established in connection with this one, which might be called the  Harrington Sanctuary, as Harrington is a well-known telegraph station,  a central point between cape Whittle and Mekattina, and it enjoys a  name that can be easily pronounced. In the Gulf the Bird rocks and  Bonaventure island to the south; one of the Mingan islands, the  Perroquets and Egg island to the north; with the Pilgrims, up the  River, above the Saguenay and off the South Shore, are the best. The  Pilgrims, 700 miles from the Atlantic, are probably the furthest  inland point in the world where the eider breeds. They would make an  ideal seabird sanctuary. On the Atlantic Labrador there are plenty of  suitable islands from which to choose two or three sanctuaries,  between Hamilton inlet and Ramah. The east coast of Hudson bay is full  of islands from which two corresponding sanctuaries might be selected,  one in the neighbourhood of the Portland promontory and the other in  the southeast corner of James bay.    There is the further question--affecting all migratory animals, but  especially birds--of making international agreements for their  protection. There are precedents for this, both in the Old World and  in the New. And, so far as the United States are concerned, there  should be no great difficulty. True, they have set us some lamentable  examples of wanton destruction. But they have also set us some noble  examples of conservation. And we have good friends at court, in the  members of the New York Zoological, the Audubon and other societies,  in Mr. Roosevelt, himself an ardent conserver of wild life, and in Mr.  Bryce, who is an ex-president of the Alpine Club and a devoted lover  of nature. Immediate steps should be taken to link our own bird  sanctuaries with the splendid American chain of them which runs round  the Gulf of Mexico and up the Atlantic coast to within easy reach of  the boundary line. Corresponding international chains up the  Mississippi and along the Pacific would be of immense benefit to all  species, and more particularly to those unfortunate ones which are  forced to migrate down along the shore and back by the middle of the  continent, thus running the deadly gauntlet both by land and sea.    Inland sanctuaries are more difficult to choose and manage. A deer  sanctuary might answer near James bay. Fur sanctuaries must also be in  some fairly accessible places, on the seaward sides of the various  heights-of-land, and not too far in. The evergreen stretches of the  Eastmain river have several favourable spots. What is needed most is  an immediate examination by a trained zoologist. The existing  information should be brought together and carefully digested for him  in advance. There are the Dominion, Provincial and Newfoundland  official reports; the Hudson Bay Company, the Moravian missionaries;  Dr. Robert Bell, Mr. A.P. Low, Mr. D.I.V. Eaton, Dr. Grenfell, Dr.  Hare, Mr. Napoleon Comeau, not to mention previous writers, like  Packard, McLean and Cartwright--a whole host of original authorities.  But their work has never been thoroughly co-ordinated from a  zoological point of view. A form of sanctuary suggested"]]]
