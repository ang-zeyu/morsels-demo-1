She spake and bound beneath her feet her lovely golden  sandals that wax not old, and bare her alike over the wet  sea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the  wind. And she seized her doughty spear, shod with sharp  bronze, weighty and huge and strong, wherewith she quells  the ranks of heroes with whomsoever she is wroth, the  daughter of the mighty sire. Then from the heights of  Olympus she came glancing down, and she stood in the land  of Ithaca, at the entry of the gate of Odysseus, on the  threshold of the courtyard, holding in her hand the spear  of bronze, in the semblance of a stranger, Mentes the  captain of the Taphians. And there she found the lordly  wooers: now they were taking their pleasure at draughts in  front of the doors, sitting on hides of oxen, which  themselves had slain. And of the henchmen and the ready  squires, some were mixing for them wine and water in bowls,  and some again were washing the tables with porous sponges  and were setting them forth, and others were carving flesh  in plenty.    And godlike Telemachus was far the first to descry her, for  he was sitting with a heavy heart among the wooers dreaming  on his good father, if haply he might come somewhence, and  make a scattering of the wooers there throughout the  palace, and himself get honour and bear rule among his own  possessions. Thinking thereupon, as he sat among wooers, he  saw Athene--and he went straight to the outer porch, for he  thought it blame in his heart that a stranger should stand  long at the gates: and halting nigh her he clasped her  right hand and took from her the spear of bronze, and  uttered his voice and spake unto her winged words:    'Hail, stranger, with us thou shalt be kindly entreated,  and thereafter, when thou hast tasted meat, thou shalt tell  us that whereof thou hast need.'    Therewith he led the way, and Pallas Athene followed. And  when they were now within the lofty house, he set her spear  that he bore against a tall pillar, within the polished  spear-stand, where stood many spears besides, even those of  Odysseus of the hardy heart; and he led the goddess and  seated her on a goodly carven chair, and spread a linen  cloth thereunder, and beneath was a footstool for the feet.  For himself he placed an inlaid seat hard by, apart from  the company of the wooers, lest the stranger should be  disquieted by the noise and should have a loathing for the  meal, being come among overweening men, and also that he  might ask him about his father that was gone from his home.    Then a handmaid bare water for the washing of hands in a  goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin  to wash withal, and drew to their side a polished table.  And a grave dame bare wheaten bread and set it by them, and  laid on the board many dainties, giving freely of such  things as she had by her. And a carver lifted and placed by  them platters of divers kinds of flesh, and nigh them he  set golden bowls, and a henchman walked to and fro pouring  out to them the wine.    Then in came the lordly wooers; and they sat them down in  rows on chairs, and on high seats, and henchmen poured  water on their hands, and maidservants piled wheaten bread  by them in baskets, and pages crowned the bowls with drink;  and they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer  spread before them. Now when the wooers had put from them  the desire of meat and drink, they minded them of other  things, even of the song and dance: for these are the crown  of the feast. And a henchman placed a beauteous lyre in the  hands of Phemius, who was minstrel to the wooers despite  his will. Yea and as he touched the lyre he lifted up his  voice in sweet songs.{*}    {* Or, according to the ordinary interpretation of [Greek]:  So he touched the chords in prelude to his sweet singing.}    But Telemachus spake unto grey-eyed Athene, holding his  head close to her that those others might not hear: 'Dear  stranger, wilt thou of a truth be wroth at the word that I  shall say? Yonder men verily care for such things as these,  the lyre and song, lightly, as they that devour the  livelihood of another without atonement, of that man whose  white bones, it may be, lie wasting in the rain upon the  mainland, or the billow rolls them in the brine. Were but  these men to see him returned to Ithaca, they all would  pray rather for greater speed of foot than for gain of gold  and raiment. But now he hath perished, even so, an evil  doom, and for us is no comfort, no, not though any of  earthly men should say that he will come again. Gone is the  day of his returning! But come declare me this, and tell me  all plainly: Who art thou of the sons of men, and whence?  Where is thy city, where are they that begat thee? Say, on  what manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors  bring thee to Ithaca, and who did they avow themselves to  be, for in nowise do I deem that thou camest hither by  land.  And herein tell me true, that I may know for a  surety whether thou art a newcomer, or whether thou art a  guest of the house, seeing that many were the strangers  that came to our home, for that HE too had voyaged much  among men.'    Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: 'Yea now,  I will plainly tell thee all. I avow me to be Mentes, son  of wise Anchialus, and I bear rule among the Taphians,  lovers of the oar. And now am I come to shore, as thou  seest, with ship and crew, sailing over the wine-dark sea,  unto men of strange speech, even to Temesa, {*} in quest of  copper, and my cargo is shining iron. And there my ship is  lying toward the upland, away from the city, in the harbour  of Rheithron beneath wooded Neion: and we declare ourselves  to be friends one of the other, and of houses friendly,  from of old. Nay, if thou wouldest be assured, go ask the  old man, the hero Laertes, who they say no more comes to  the city, but far away toward the upland suffers  affliction, with an ancient woman for his handmaid, who  sets by him meat and drink, whensoever weariness takes hold  of his limbs, as he creeps along the knoll of his vineyard  plot.  And now am I come; for verily they said that HE, thy  father, was among his people; but lo, the gods withhold him  from his way. For goodly Odysseus hath not yet perished on  the earth; but still, methinks, he lives and is kept on the  wide deep in a seagirt isle, and hard men constrain him,  wild folk that hold him, it may be, sore against his will.  But now of a truth will I utter my word of prophecy, as the  Immortals bring it into my heart and as I deem it will be  accomplished, though no soothsayer am I, nor skilled in the  signs of birds. Henceforth indeed for no long while shall  he be far from his own dear country, not though bonds of  iron bind him; he will advise him of a way to return, for  he is a man of many devices. But come, declare me this, and  tell me all plainly, whether indeed, so tall as thou art,  thou art sprung from the loins of Odysseus. Thy head surely  and they beauteous eyes are wondrous like to his, since  full many a time have we held converse together ere he  embarked for Troy, whither the others, aye the bravest of  the Argives, went in hollow ships. From that day forth  neither have I seen Odysseus, nor he me.'    {* Tamasia, in the mountainous centre of Cyprus.}    Then wise Telemachus answered her, and said: 'Yea, sir, now  will I plainly tell thee all. My mother verily saith that I  am his; for myself I know not, for never man yet knew of  himself his own descent. O that I had been the son of some  blessed man, whom old age overtook among his own  possessions! But now of him that is the most hapless of  mortal men, his son they say that I am, since thou dost  question me hereof.'    Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake unto him, and  said: 'Surely no nameless lineage have the gods ordained  for thee in days to come, since Penelope bore thee so  goodly a man. But come, declare me this, and tell it all  plainly. What feast, nay, what rout is this? What hast thou  to do therewith? Is it a clan drinking, or a wedding feast,  for here we have no banquet where each man brings his  share? In such wise, flown with insolence, do they seem to  me to revel wantonly through the house: and well might any  man be wroth to see so many deeds of shame, whatso wise man  came among them.'    Then wise Telemachus answered her, and said: 'Sir,  forasmuch as thou questionest me of these things and  inquirest thereof, our house was once like to have been  rich and honourable, while yet that man was among his  people. But now the gods willed it otherwise, in evil  purpose, who have made him pass utterly out of sight as no  man ever before.  Truly I would not even for his death make  so great sorrow, had he fallen among his fellows in the  land of the Trojans, or in the arms of his friends when he  had wound up the clew of war. Then would the whole Achaean  host have builded him a barrow, and even for his son would  he have won great glory in the after days. But now the  spirits of the storm have swept him away inglorious. He is  gone, lost to sight and hearsay, but for me hath he left  anguish and lamentation; nor henceforth is it for him alone  that I mourn and weep, since the gods have wrought for me  other sore distress. For all the noblest that are princes  in the isles, in Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus,  and as many as lord it in rocky Ithaca, all these woo my  mother and waste my house. But as for her she neither  refuseth the hated bridal, nor hath the heart to make an  end: so they devour and minish my house, and ere long will  they make havoc likewise of myself.'    Then in heavy displeasure spake unto him Pallas Athene:  'God help thee! thou art surely sore in need of Odysseus  that is afar, to stretch forth "]]]
