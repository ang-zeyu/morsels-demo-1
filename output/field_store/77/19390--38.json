The yoong gentlemen according to their fathers commandement,  being arriued in Greece, made such warre against Danaus, that in the end  he was constrained to giue vnto those his 50. nephues his 50. daughters,  to ioine with them in mariage, and so they were. But as the prouerbe  saith, \"In trust appeared treacherie.\" For on the first night of the  mariage, Danaus deliuered to ech of his daughters a sword, charging them  that when their husbands after their bankets and pastimes were once  brought into a sound sleepe, ech of them should slea hir husband,  menacing them with death vnlesse they fulfilled his commandement. They  all therefore obeied the will of their father, Hypermnestra onely  excepted, with whom preuailed more the loue of kinred and wedlocke, than  the feare of hir fathers displeasure: for shee alone spared the life of  hir husband Lynceus, waking him out of his sleepe, and warning him to  depart and flee into Aegypt to his father. He therefore hauing all the  wicked practises reuealed to him by his wife, followed hir aduice, and so  escaped.    [Sidenote: _Pausanias_.]  Now when Danaus perceiued how all his daughters had accomplished his  commandement, sauing onelie Hypermnestra, he caused hir to be brought  forth into iudgement, for disobeieng him in a matter wherein both the  safetie and losse of his life rested: but she was acquitted by the  Argiues, & discharged. Howbeit hir father kept hir in prison, and  seeking to find out other husbands for his other daughters that had  obeied his pleasure in sleaing their first husbands, long it was yer  he could find any to match with them: for the heinous offense committed  in the slaughter of their late husbands, was yet too fresh in memorie,  and their bloud not wiped out of mind. Neuerthelesse, to bring his  purpose the better to passe, he made proclamation, that his daughters  should demand no ioinctures, and euerie suter should take his choise  without respect to the age of the ladie, or abilitie of him that came to  make his choise, but so as first come best serued, according to their  owne phantasies and likings. Howbeit when this policie also failed,  & would not serue his turne, he deuised a game of running, ordeining  therewith, that whosoeuer got the best price should haue the first choise  among all the sisters; and he that got the second, should choose next to  the first; and so foorth, ech one after an other, according to the triall  of their swiftnesse of foote.    How much this practise auailed, I know not: but certeine it is, diuers of  them were bestowed, either by this or some other meanes, for we find that  Autonomes was maried to Architeles, Chrysanta or (as Pausanias saith)  Scea was matched with Archandrus, Amaome with Neptunus Equestris, on  whome he begat Nauplius.    [Sidenote: _Higinus_.]  But now to returne vnto Lynceus, whome his wife Hypermnestra preserued, as  before ye haue heard. After he was once got out of the reach and danger of  his father in law king Danaus, he gaue knowledge thereof to his wife, in  [Sidenote: _Pausanias_.]  raising a fire on heigth beaconwise, accordingly as she had requested him  to doo at his departure from hir: and this was at a place which afterwards  tooke name of him, and was called Lyncea. Upon his returne into Aegypt, he  gaue his father to vnderstand the whole circumstance of the trecherous  crueltie vsed by his vncle and his daughters in the murder of his  brethren, and how hardly he himselfe had escaped death out of his vncles  handes. Wherevpon at time conuenient he was furnished foorth with men and  ships by his father, for the speedie reuenge of that heinous, vnnaturall  and most disloiall murder, in which enterprise he sped him foorth with  such diligence, that in short time he found meanes to dispatch his vncle  Danaus, set his wife Hypermnestra at libertie, and subdued the whole  kingdome of the Argiues.    This done, he caused the daughters of Danaus (so many as remained within  the limits of his dominion) to be sent for, whome he thought not worthie  to liue, bicause of the cruell murther which they had committed on his  brethren: but yet for that they were his wiues sisters, he would not  put them to death, but commanded them to be thrust into a ship, without  maister, mate or mariner, and so to be turned into the maine ocean sea,  and to take and abide such fortune as should chance vnto them. These  [Sidenote: _Harding_ and _Iohn Rouse_ out of _David Pencair_.]  ladies thus imbarked and left to the mercy of the seas, by hap were  brought to the coasts of this Ile then called Albion, where they tooke  land, and in seeking to prouide themselues of victuals by pursute of  wilde beasts, met with no other inhabitants, than the rude and sauage  giants mentioned before, whome our historiens for their beastlie kind of  life doo call diuells. With these monsters did these ladies (finding none  other to satisfie the motions of their sensuall lust) ioine in the act of  venerie, and ingendred a race of people in proportion nothing differing  from their fathers that begat them, nor in conditions from their mothers  that bare them.    But now peraduenture ye wil thinke that I haue forgotten my selfe, in  rehearsing this historie of the ladies arriuall here, bicause I make no  mention of Albina, which should be the eldest of the sisters, of whome  this land should also take the name of Albion. To this we answer, that as  the name of their father hath bene mistaken, so likewise hath the whole  course of the historie in this behalfe. For though we shall admit that  to be true which is rehearsed (in maner as before ye haue heard) of the  arriuall here of those ladies; yet certeine it is that none of them bare  the name of Albina, from whome this land might be called Albion. For  further assurance whereof, if any man be desirous to know all their  [Sidenote: _Higinus_.  The names of the daughters of Danaus.]  names, we haue thought good here to rehearse them as they be found in  Higinus, Pausanias, and others. 1 Idea, 2 Philomela, 3 Scillo, 4 Phicomene,  5 Euippe, 6 Demoditas, 7 Hyale, 8 Trite, 9 Damone, 10 Hippothoe, 11  Mirmidone, 12 Euridice, 13 Chleo, 14 Vrania, 15 Cleopatra, 16 Phylea, 17  Hypareta, 18 Chrysothemis, 19 Heranta, 20 Armoaste, 21 Danaes, 22 Scea,  23 Glaucippe, 24 Demophile, 25 Autodice, 26 Polyxena, 27 Hecate, 28  Achamantis, 29 Arsalte, 30 Monuste, 31 Amimone, 32 Helice, 33 Amaome, 34  Polybe, 35 Helicte, 36 Electra, 37 Eubule, 38 Daphildice, 39 Hero, 40  Europomene, 41 Critomedia, 42 Pyrene, 43 Eupheno, 44 Themistagora, 45  Paleno, 46 Erato, 47 Autonomes, 48 Itea, 49 Chrysanta, 50 Hypermnestra.  These were the names of those ladies the daughters of Danaus: howbeit,  which they were that should arriue in this Ile, we can not say: but it  sufficeth to vnderstand, that none of them hight Albina. So that, whether  the historie of their landing here should be true or not, it is all one  for the matter concerning the name of this Ile, which vndoubtedlie was  [Sidenote: See more in the description.]  called Albion, either of Albion the giant (as before I haue said) or by  some other occasion.    And thus much for the ladies, whose strange aduenture of their arriuall  here, as it may seeme to manie & (with good cause) incredible, so without  further auouching it for truth I leaue it to the consideration of the  reader, to thinke thereof as reason shall moue him sith I see not how  either in this, or in other things of such antiquitie, we cannot haue  sufficient warrant otherwise than by likelie coniectures. Which as in  this historie of the ladies they are not most probable, yet haue we  shewed the likeliest, that (as we thinke) may be deemed to agree with  those authors that haue written of their comming into this Ile. But as  for an assured proofe that this Ile was inhabited with people before the  comming of Brute, I trust it may suffice which before is recited out of  Annius de Viterbo, Theophilus, Gildas, and other, although much more  might be said: as of the comming hither of Osiris, as well as in the  [Sidenote: Vlysses in Britaine.]  other parties of the world: and likewise of Vlysses his being here, who  in performing some vow which he either then did make, or before had made,  erected an altar in that part of Scotland which was ancientlie called  [Sidenote: _Iulius Solinus_.]  Calidonia, as Iulius Solinus Polyhistor in plaine words dooth record.    ¶ Vpon these considerations I haue no doubt to deliuer vnto the reader,  the opinion of those that thinke this land to haue bene inhabited before  the arriuall here of Brute, trusting it may be taken in good part,  sith we haue but shewed the coniectures of others, till time that some  sufficient learned man shall take vpon him to decipher the doubts of all  these matters. Neuerthelesse, I thinke good to aduertise the reader that  these stories of Samothes, Magus, Sarron, Druis, and Bardus, doo relie  onelie vpon the authoritie of Berosus, whom most diligent antiquaries doo  reiect as a fabulous and counterfet author, and Vacerius hath laboured to  prooue the same by a speciall treatise latelie published at Rome.          THE END OF THE"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16523"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (#5)"],[1,"challenge of finding an English  style which would not only faithfully convey the exactness of the text's  meaning, but would also evoke in the reader the spirit of meditative  reverence which is a distinguishing feature of response to the original.  The form of expression he selected, reminiscent of the style used by the  seventeenth-century translators of the Bible, captures the elevated mode  of Baha'u'llah's Arabic, while remaining accessible to the contemporary  reader. His translations, moreover, are illumined by his uniquely inspired  understanding of the purport and implications of the originals.    Although both Arabic and English are languages with rich vocabularies and  varied modes of expression, their forms differ widely from one another.  The Arabic of the Kitab-i-Aqdas is marked by intense concentration and  terseness of expression. It is a characteristic of this style that if a  connotation is obvious it should not be explicitly stated. This presents a  problem for a reader whose cultural, religious and literary background is  entirely different from that of Arabic. A literal translation of a passage  which is clear in the Arabic could be obscure in English. It therefore  becomes necessary to include in the English translation of such passages  that element of the Arabic sentence which is obviously implicit in the  original. At the same time, it is vital to avoid extrapolating this  process to the point where it would add unjustifiably to the original or  limit its meaning. Striking the right balance between beauty and clarity  of expression on the one hand, and literalness on the other, is one of the  major issues with which the translators have had to grapple and which has  caused repeated reconsideration of the rendering of certain passages.  Another major issue is the legal implication of certain Arabic terms which  have a range of meanings different from those of similar terms in English.    Sacred Scripture clearly requires especial care and faithfulness in  translation. This is supremely important in the case of a Book of Laws,  where it is vital that the reader not be misled or drawn into fruitless  disputation. As had been foreseen, the translation of the Most Holy Book  has been a work of the utmost difficulty, requiring consultation with  experts in many lands. Since some one third of the text had already been  translated by Shoghi Effendi, it was necessary to strive for three  qualities in the translation of the remaining passages: accuracy of  meaning, beauty of English, and conformity of style with that used by  Shoghi Effendi.    We are now satisfied that the translation has reached a point where it  represents an acceptable rendering of the original. Nevertheless, it will  undoubtedly give rise to questions and suggestions which may shed further  light on its content. We are profoundly grateful for the assiduous and  meticulous labours of the members of the Committees whom we commissioned  to prepare and review this translation of the Aqdas and to compose the  annotations. We are confident that this first authorized English edition  of the Kitab-i-Aqdas will enable its readers to obtain at least an inkling  of the splendour of the Mother Book of the Baha'i Dispensation.    Our world has entered the dark heart of an age of fundamental change  beyond anything in all of its tumultuous history. Its peoples, of whatever  race, nation, or religion, are being challenged to subordinate all lesser  loyalties and limiting identities to their oneness as citizens of a single  planetary homeland. In Baha'u'llah's words: \"The well-being of mankind,  its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is  firmly established.\" May the publication of this translation of the  Kitab-i-Aqdas lend a fresh impulse to the realization of this universal  vision, opening vistas of a worldwide regeneration.                                                THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE            A DESCRIPTION OF THE KITAB-I-AQDAS BY SHOGHI EFFENDI         Taken from _God Passes By_, His History of the First Baha'i Century      Unique and stupendous as was this Proclamation, it proved to be but a  prelude to a still mightier revelation of the creative power of its  Author, and to what may well rank as the most signal act of His  ministry--the promulgation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. Alluded to in the  Kitab-i-Iqan, the principal repository of that Law which the Prophet  Isaiah had anticipated, and which the writer of the Apocalypse had  described as the \"new heaven\" and the \"new earth\", as \"the Tabernacle of  God\", as the \"Holy City\", as the \"Bride\", the \"New Jerusalem coming down  from God\", this \"Most Holy Book\", whose provisions must remain inviolate  for no less than a thousand years, and whose system will embrace the  entire planet, may well be regarded as the brightest emanation of the mind  of Baha'u'llah, as the Mother Book of His Dispensation, and the Charter of  His New World Order.    Revealed soon after Baha'u'llah had been transferred to the house of Udi  K{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}ammar (circa 1873), at a time when He was still encompassed by the  tribulations that had afflicted Him, through the acts committed by His  enemies and the professed adherents of His Faith, this Book, this treasury  enshrining the priceless gems of His Revelation, stands out, by virtue of  the principles it inculcates, the administrative institutions it ordains  and the function with which it invests the appointed Successor of its  Author, unique and incomparable among the world's sacred Scriptures. For,  unlike the Old Testament and the Holy Books which preceded it, in which  the actual precepts uttered by the Prophet Himself are non-existent;  unlike the Gospels, in which the few sayings attributed to Jesus Christ  afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration of the  affairs of His Faith; unlike even the Qur'an which, though explicit in the  laws and ordinances formulated by the Apostle of God, is silent on the  all-important subject of the succession, the Kitab-i-Aqdas, revealed from  first to last by the Author of the Dispensation Himself, not only  preserves for posterity the basic laws and ordinances on which the fabric  of His future World Order must rest, but ordains, in addition to the  function of interpretation which it confers upon His Successor, the  necessary institutions through which the integrity and unity of His Faith  can alone be safeguarded.    In this Charter of the future world civilization its Author--at once the  Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and Redeemer of mankind--announces to the  kings of the earth the promulgation of the \"Most Great Law\"; pronounces  them to be His vassals; proclaims Himself the \"King of Kings\"; disclaims  any intention of laying hands on their kingdoms; reserves for Himself the  right to \"seize and possess the hearts of men\"; warns the world's  ecclesiastical leaders not to weigh the \"Book of God\" with such standards  as are current amongst them; and affirms that the Book itself is the  \"Unerring Balance\" established amongst men. In it He formally ordains the  institution of the \"House of Justice\", defines its functions, fixes its  revenues, and designates its members as the \"Men of Justice\", the  \"Deputies of God\", the \"Trustees of the All-Merciful\"; alludes to the  future Centre of His Covenant, and invests Him with the right of  interpreting His holy Writ; anticipates by implication the institution of  Guardianship; bears witness to the revolutionizing effect of His World  Order; enunciates the doctrine of the \"Most Great Infallibility\" of the  Manifestation of God; asserts this infallibility to be the inherent and  exclusive right of the Prophet; and rules out the possibility of the  appearance of another Manifestation ere the lapse of at least one thousand  years.    In this Book He, moreover, prescribes the obligatory prayers; designates  the time and period of fasting; prohibits congregational prayer except for  the dead; fixes the Qiblih; institutes the Huququ'llah (Right of God);  formulates the law of inheritance; ordains the institution of the  Mas{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}riqu'l-Ad{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}kar; establishes the Nineteen Day Feast, the Baha'i  festivals and the Intercalary Days; abolishes the institution of  priesthood; prohibits slavery, asceticism, mendicancy, monasticism,  penance, the use of pulpits and the kissing of hands; prescribes monogamy;  condemns cruelty to animals, idleness and sloth, backbiting and calumny;  censures divorce; interdicts gambling, the use of opium, wine and other  intoxicating drinks; specifies the punishments for murder, arson, adultery  and theft; stresses the importance of marriage and lays down its essential  conditions; imposes the obligation of engaging in some trade or  profession, exalting such occupation to the rank of worship; emphasizes  the necessity of providing the means for the education of children; and  lays upon every person the duty of writing a testament and of strict  obedience to one's government.    Apart from these provisions Baha'u'llah exhorts His followers to consort,  with amity and concord and without discrimination, with the adherents of  all religions; warns them to guard against fanaticism, sedition, pride,  dispute and contention; inculcates upon them immaculate cleanliness,  strict truthfulness, spotless chastity, trustworthiness, hospitality,  fidelity, courtesy, forbearance, justice and fairness; counsels them to be  \"even as the fingers of one hand and the limbs of one body\"; calls upon  them to arise and serve His Cause; and assures them of His undoubted aid.  He, furthermore, dwells upon the instability of human affairs; declares  that true liberty consists in man's submission to His commandments;  cautions them not to be indulgent in carrying out His statutes; "]]]
