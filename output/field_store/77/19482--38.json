It was already  easy to see that, if circumstances became unfavourable to us, there  would be no want of men to take advantage of them. In 1809, even before  the disaster of Esslingen, the first who had ventured to raise the  standard of independence against Napoleon were Prussians. He sent them  to the galleys; so important did he feel it to smother that cry of  revolt, which seemed to echo that of the Spaniards, and might become  general.    Independently of all these causes of hatred, the position of Prussia,  between France and Russia, compelled Napoleon to remain her master; he  could not reign there but by force--he could not be strong there but by  her weakness.    He ruined the country, although he must have known well that poverty  creates audacity; that the hope of gain becomes the moving principle of  those who have nothing more to lose; and finally, that in leaving them  nothing but the sword, he in a manner obliged them to turn it against  himself. In consequence, on the approach of the year 1812, and of the  terrible struggle which it was to produce, Frederick, uneasy and tired  of his subservient position, was determined to extricate himself from  it, either by an alliance or by war. In March, 1811, he offered himself  to Napoleon as an auxiliary in the expedition which he was preparing. In  the month of May, and again in the month of August, he repeated that  offer; and as he received no satisfactory answer, he declared, that as  the great military movements which surrounded, crossed, or drained his  kingdom, were such as to excite his apprehension that his entire  destruction was meditated, \"he took up arms, because circumstances  imperiously called upon him to do so, deeming it far preferable to die  sword in hand than to fall with disgrace.\"    It was said at the same time, that Frederick secretly offered to  Alexander to give him possession of Graudentz, and his magazines, and  to put himself at the head of his insurgent subjects, if the Russian  army should advance into Silesia. If the same authorities are to be  believed, Alexander received this proposition, very favourably. He  immediately sent to Bagration and Wittgenstein sealed marching orders.  They were instructed not to open them until they received another letter  from their sovereign, which he never wrote, having changed his  resolution. A variety of causes might have dictated that change; 1st, a  wish not to be the first to commence so great a war, and his anxiety to  have divine justice and the opinion of mankind on his side, by not  appearing the aggressor; 2d, that Frederick, becoming less uneasy as to  the plans of Napoleon, had resolved to follow his fortunes. It is  probable, after all, that the noble sentiments which Alexander expressed  in his reply to the king were his only motives: we are assured that he  wrote to him, \"That in a war which might begin by reverses, and in which  perseverance was required, he only felt courageous for himself, and that  the misfortunes of an ally might shake his resolution; that it would  grieve him to chain Prussia to his fortune if it was bad; that if it was  good he should always be ready to share it with her, whatever line of  conduct necessity might oblige her to pursue.\"    These details have been certified to us by a witness, although an  inferior one. However, whether this counsel proceeded from the  generosity or the policy of Alexander, or Frederick was determined  solely by the necessity of the case, it is certain that it was high  time for him to come to a decision; for in February, 1812, these  communications with Alexander, _if there were such_, or the hope of  obtaining better terms from France having made him hesitate in replying  to the definitive propositions of Napoleon, the latter, becoming  impatient, sent additional forces to Dantzic, and made Davoust enter  Pomerania. His orders for this invasion of a Swedish province were  repeated and pressing; they were grounded on the illicit commerce  carried on by the Pomeranians with the English, and subsequently on the  necessity of compelling Prussia to accede to his terms. The Prince of  Eckmuehl even received orders to hold himself in readiness to take  immediate possession of that kingdom, and to seize the person of her  sovereign, if within eight days from the date of these orders the latter  had not concluded the offensive alliance dictated to him by France; but  while the marshal was tracing the few marches necessary for this  operation, he received intelligence that the treaty of the 21st of  February, 1812, had been ratified.    This submission did not altogether satisfy Napoleon. To his strength he  added artifice; his suspicions still led him to covet the occupation of  the fortresses, which he was ashamed not to leave in Frederick's hands;  he required the king to keep only 50 or 80 invalids in some, and desired  that some French officers should be admitted into others; all of whom  were to send their reports to him, and to follow his orders. His  solicitude extended to every thing. \"Spandau,\" said he, in his letters  to Davoust, \"is the citadel of Berlin, as Pillau is that of Koenigsberg;\"  and French troops had orders to be ready to introduce themselves at the  first signal: the manner he himself pointed out. At Potsdam, which the  king had reserved for himself, and which our troops were interdicted  from entering, his orders were, that the French officers should  frequently show themselves, in order to observe, and to accustom the  people to the sight of them. He recommended every degree of respect to  be shown, both to the king and his subjects; but at the same time he  required that every sort of arms should be taken from the latter, which  might be of use to them in an insurrection; and he pointed out every  thing of the kind, even to the smallest weapon. Anticipating the  possibility of the loss of a battle, and the chances of Prussian  _vespers_, he ordered that his troops should be either put into barracks  or encampments, with a thousand other precautions of the minutest  description. As a final security, in case of the English making a  descent between the Elbe and the Vistula, although Victor, and  subsequently Augereau, were to occupy Prussia with 50,000 men, he  engaged by treaty the assistance of 10,000 Danes.    All these precautions were still insufficient to remove his distrust;  when the Prince of Hatzfeld came to require of him a subsidy of 25  millions of francs to meet the expenses of the war which was preparing,  his reply to Daru was, \"that he would take especial care not to furnish  an enemy with arms against himself.\" In this manner did Frederick,  entangled as it were in a net of iron, which surrounded and held him  tight in every part, put between 20 and 30,000 of his troops, and his  principal fortresses and magazines, at the disposal of Napoleon[2].    [Footnote 2: By this treaty, Prussia agreed to furnish two hundred  thousand quintals of rye, twenty-four thousand of rice, two million  bottles of beer, four hundred thousand quintals of wheat, six hundred  and fifty thousand of straw, three hundred and fifty thousand of hay,  six million bushels of oats, forty-four thousand oxen, fifteen thousand  horses, three thousand six hundred waggons, with harness and drivers,  each carrying a load of fifteen hundred weight; and finally, hospitals  provided with every thing necessary for twenty thousand sick. It is  true, that all these supplies were to be allowed in deduction of the  remainder of the taxes imposed by the conquest.]          CHAP. III.      These two treaties opened the road to Russia to Napoleon; but in order  to penetrate into the interior of that empire, it was necessary to make  sure of Sweden and Turkey.    Military combinations were then so much aggrandized, that in order to  sketch a plan of warfare, it was no longer necessary to study the  configuration of a province, or of a chain of mountains, or the course  of a river. When monarchs, such as Alexander and Napoleon, were  contending for the dominion of Europe, it was necessary to regard the  general and relative position of every state with a universal _coup  d'oeil_; it was no longer on single maps, but on that of the whole  globe, that their policy had to trace its plans of hostility.    Russia is mistress of the heights of Europe; her flanks are supported by  the seas of the north and south. Her government can only with great  difficulty be driven into a straight, and forced to submit, in a space  almost beyond the imagination to conceive: the conquest of which would  require long campaigns, to which her climate is completely opposed. From  this, it follows, that without the concurrence of Turkey and Sweden,  Russia is less vulnerable. The assistance of these two powers was  therefore requisite in order to surprise her, to strike her to the heart  in her modern capital, and to turn at a distance, in the rear of its  left, her grand army of the Niemen,--and not merely to precipitate  attacks on a part of her front, in plains where the extent of space  prevented confusion, and left a thousand roads open to the retreat of  that army.    The meanest soldier in our ranks, therefore, expected to hear of the  combined march of the Grand Vizir towards Kief, and of Bernadotte  against Finland. Eight sovereigns were already enlisted under the  banners of Napoleon; but the two who had the greatest interest in the  quarrel were still deaf to his call.

One day the Turk rode up and struck his slave with his riding-whip.  This was more than Smith could bear; he rushed at his master, and  with one blow of his bat knocked his brains out. He then mounted the  dead man's horse and escaped. After a time he got back to England;  but as England seemed a little dull to Captain Smith, he resolved  to join some emigrants who were going to Virginia.    [Illustration: CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH.]      38. What happened to Captain Smith on the voyage; the landing at  Jamestown; what the settlers wanted to do; Smith's plan.--On the way  to America, Smith was accused of plotting to murder the chief men  among the settlers so that he might make himself \"King of Virginia.\"  The accusation was false, but he was put in irons and kept a prisoner  for the rest of the voyage.    In the spring of 1607 the emigrants reached Chesapeake[1] Bay, and  sailed up a river which they named the James in honor of King James  of England; when they landed they named the settlement Jamestown for  the same reason. Here they built a log fort, and placed three or four  small cannon on its walls. Most of the men who settled Jamestown came  hoping to find mines of gold in Virginia, or else a way through to  the Pacific Ocean and to the Indies, which they thought could not  be very far away. But Captain Smith wanted to help his countrymen  to make homes here for themselves and their children.    [Illustration: Map showing Jamestown.]    [Footnote 1: Chesapeake (Ches'a-peek).]      39. Smith's trial and what came of it; how the settlers lived; the  first English church; sickness; attempted desertion.--As soon as  Captain Smith landed, he demanded to be tried by a jury[2] of twelve  men. The trial took place. It was the first English court and the  first English jury that ever sat in America. The captain proved his  innocence and was set free. His chief accuser was condemned to pay  him a large sum of money for damages. Smith generously gave this money  to help the settlement.    As the weather was warm, the emigrants did not begin building log  cabins at once, but slept on the ground, sheltered by boughs of trees.  For a church they had an old tent, in which they met on Sunday. They  were all members of the Church of England, or the Episcopal Church,  and that tent was the first place of worship that we know of which  was opened by Englishmen in America.    When the hot weather came, many fell sick. Soon the whole settlement  was like a hospital. Sometimes three or four would die in one night.  Captain Smith, though not well himself, did everything he could for  those who needed his help.    When the sickness was over, some of the settlers were so discontented  that they determined to seize the only vessel there was at Jamestown  and go back to England. Captain Smith turned the cannon of the fort  against them. The deserters saw that if they tried to leave the harbor  he would knock their vessel to pieces, so they came back. One of the  leaders of these men was tried and shot; the other was sent to England  in disgrace.    [Footnote 2: Jury: a number of men, generally twelve, selected  according to law to try a case in a court of law; in criminal cases  they declare the person accused to be either guilty or not guilty.]      40. The Indians of Virginia.--When the Indians of America first met  the white men, they were very friendly to them; but this did not last  long, because often the whites treated the Indians very badly; in  fact, the Spaniards made slaves of them and whipped many of them to  death. But these were the Indians of the south; some of the northern  tribes were terribly fierce and a match for the Spaniards in cruelty.    The Indians at the east did not build cities, but lived in small  villages. These villages were made up of huts, covered with the bark  of trees. Such huts were called wigwams. The women did nearly all  the work, such as building the wigwams and hoeing corn and tobacco.  The men hunted and made war. Instead of guns the Indians had bows  and arrows. With these they could bring down a deer or a squirrel  quite as well as a white man could now with a rifle. They had no iron,  but made hatchets and knives out of sharp, flat stones. They never  built roads, for they had no wagons, and at the east they did not  use horses; but they could find their way with ease through the  thickest forest. When they came to a river they swam across it, so  they had no need of bridges. For boats they made canoes of birch bark.  These canoes were almost as light as paper, yet they were very strong  and handsome, and they          \"floated on the river    Like a yellow leaf in autumn,    Like a yellow water-lily.\"[3]    In them they could go hundreds of miles quickly and silently. So every  river and stream became a roadway to the Indian.    [Illustration: BUILDING A WIGWAM.]    [Footnote 3: Longfellow's _Hiawatha_ (Hiawatha's Sailing).]      41. Captain Smith goes in search of the Pacific; he is captured by  Indians.--After that first long, hot summer was over, some of the  settlers wished to explore the country and see if they could not find  a short way through to the Pacific Ocean. Captain Smith led the  expedition. The Indians attacked them, killed three of the men, and  took the captain prisoner. To amuse the Indians, Smith showed them  his pocket compass. When the savages saw that the needle always  pointed toward the north they were greatly astonished, and instead  of killing their prisoner they decided to take him to their chief.  This chief was named Powhatan.[4] He was a tall, grim-looking old  man, and he hated the settlers at Jamestown, because he believed that  they had come to steal the land from the Indians.    [Illustration: POCKET COMPASS.]    [Footnote 4: Powhatan (Pow-ha-tan').]      42. Smith's life is saved by Pocahontas;[5] her marriage to John  Rolfe.[6]--Smith was dragged into the chief's wigwam; his head was  laid on a large, flat stone, and a tall savage with a big club stood  ready to dash out his brains. Just as Powhatan was about to cry  \"strike!\" his daughter Pocahontas, a girl of twelve or thirteen, ran  up, and, putting her arms round the prisoner's head, she laid her  own head on his--now let the Indian with his uplifted club strike  if he dare.[7]    Instead of being angry with his daughter, Powhatan promised her that  he would spare Smith's life. When an Indian made such a promise as  that he kept it, so the captain knew that his head was safe. Powhatan  released his prisoner and soon sent him back to Jamestown, and  Pocahontas, followed by a number of Indians, carried to the settlers  presents of corn and venison.    Some years after this the Indian maiden married John Rolfe, an  Englishman who had come to Virginia. They went to London, and  Pocahontas died not far from that city. She left a son; from that  son came some noted Virginians. One of them was John Randolph. He  was a famous man in his day, and he always spoke with pride of the  Indian princess, as he called her.    [Footnote 5: Pocahontas (Po-ka-hon'tas).]    [Footnote 6: Rolfe (Rolf).]    [Footnote 7: On Pocahontas, see List of Books at the end of this  book.]      43. Captain Smith is made governor of Jamestown; the gold-diggers;  \"Corn, or your life.\"--More emigrants came over from England, and  Captain Smith was now made governor of Jamestown. Some of the  emigrants found some glittering earth which they thought was gold.  Soon nearly every one was hard at work digging it. Smith laughed at  them; but they insisted on loading a ship with the worthless stuff  and sending it to London. That was the last that was heard of it.    The people had wasted their time digging this shining dirt when they  should have been hoeing their gardens. Soon they began to be in great  want of food. The captain started off with a party of men to buy corn  of the Indians. The Indians contrived a cunning plot to kill the whole  party. Smith luckily found it out; seizing the chief by the hair,  he pressed the muzzle of a pistol against his heart and gave him his  choice,--\"Corn, or your life!\" He got the corn, and plenty of it.    [Illustration: \"CORN, OR YOUR LIFE!\"]      44. \"He who will not work shall not eat.\"--Captain Smith then set  part of the men to planting corn, so that they might raise what they  needed. The rest of the settlers he took with him into the woods to  chop down trees and saw them into boards to send to England. Many  tried to escape from this labor; but Smith said, Men who are able  to dig for gold are able to chop; then he made this rule: \"He who  will not work shall not eat.\" Rather than lose his dinner, the laziest  man now took his axe and set off for the woods.      45. Captain Smith's cold-water cure.--But though the choppers worked,  they grumbled. They liked to see the chips fly and to hear the great  trees \"thunder as they fell,\" but the axe-handles raised blisters  on their fingers. These blisters made the men swear, so that often  one would hear an oath for every stroke of the axe. Smith said the  swearing must be stopped. He had each man's oaths set down in a book.  When the day's work was done, every offender was called up; his oaths  were counted; then he was told to hold up his right hand, and a can  of cold water was poured down his sleeve for each oath. This new style  of water cure did wonders; in a short time not an oath was heard:  it was just chop, chop, chop, and the madder the men got, the more  the chips would fly.      46. Captain Smith meets with an accident and goes back to England;  his return to America; his death.--Captain Smith had not been  governor very long when he met with a terrible accident. He was out  in a boat, and a bag of gunpowder he had with him exploded. He was  so badly hurt that he had to go back to England to get proper treatment  for his wounds.    He returned to America a number of"]]]
