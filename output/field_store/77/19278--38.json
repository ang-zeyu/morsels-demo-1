I stood and looked at it  and thought, \"This clock was running when George Washington was  president; it was running when Christopher Columbus sailed on his great  voyage of discovery; long years, long centuries before that it was  built.\"    But there is a clock surpassing all others. I call it God's clock. It is  the Sun. Since time began God's clock has kept time. It is the central  clock of our universe. It regulates all others. It does not have to be  wound. God has seen to that. How can we help worshiping the God who has  made such a clock!    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 74: 16        \"The day is thine, the night also is thine; thou hast prepared the      light and the sun.\"    MEMORY HYMN [47]        _\"Sun of my soul, thou Saviour dear.\"_          THE HUMAN KODAK      I wonder how many of you have a kodak. Yes, many of you own one. What a  wonderful little machine a kodak is! First we buy a film, then we open  the kodak and place the film. Now pull the paper over to the empty roll  and fasten, close the kodak and begin to wind. Oh, here you are, No. 1.  The day is clear, for we must have a clear day to get the best picture.  We hold the kodak very steady, then snap, we have it. Next we pull a  little slide in the back, take a pencil and write down the date and  name. Let me see, what was that picture? Oh, yes, \"Chrysanthemum (is  that the way to spell it?) exhibition.\" Next the films are developed,  and the kodak pictures are complete, all but pasting them in a big book.    For all that the kodak is a whole lot of fuss, isn't it? But, do you  know, each one of us has a kodak God has given him which works itself.  We have the open circle through which the pictures are taken, our eyes,  and beyond the eyes, in the brain, are thousands of films. We start out  in the morning and the moment we open our eyes we begin exposing those  films. We do not have to do any clicking for these pictures, one after  another, click, click, click, and they are developed as fast as they are  taken.    If you should say to a man who has reached three score years and ten,  \"Tell me the clearest picture you can remember,\" he would not show a  picture that was taken yesterday, or last week, or last year. He would  turn back the pages of his memory book fifty, sixty years. The clearest  pictures he possesses are those that were snapped in his boyhood. Every  day you are taking pictures that are going to remain with you as long as  you live. Let us resolve, girls and boys, that as we go out each morning  and our human kodak begins clicking, we shall take only pictures that  are true, pure and clean.    MEMORY VERSE, _Proverbs_ 4: 25        \"Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight      before thee.\"    MEMORY HYMN [1]        _\"O for a thousand tongues to sing      My great Redeemer's praise.\"_          WATCH LESSONS      My grandfather was a foreman in a tannery for a great many years.  Finally, as he was approaching seventy years of age, he left the tannery  to retire to a quieter life. The men who worked in his department had a  real affection for him. As an expression of that esteem they presented  him, on his last day with them, a beautiful, solid gold watch. On the  inner cover they engraved his name, the date, and the occasion of the  presentation. When my grandfather died the watch became my father's  possession. Then upon my father's death the watch came to me. What a joy  it is to carry such a watch! Here are some lessons my watch teaches me.    The case is but the outside. It is nice to have a gold case, it looks so  well. But that does not make the watch keep any better time. It would  keep just as accurate time if the case were iron. You see it is the  inside that counts. It is the same with life. The soul is the important  part of us.    Now here is the tiny second hand. It rushes around, jumping, hurrying,  fussy, as though it were doing the whole job. But you cannot tell time  by the second hand. Knock it off and the watch goes right on running.    Here's the minute hand. How big, and solemn and serious it looks! Surely  the minute hand is important. What time is it? Fifteen minutes after.  Fifteen minutes after what? The minute hand does not say.    Ah, here's the hour hand. Strong, steady, dependable. The hour hand does  not move very fast, you cannot see it move. It makes no fuss at all, but  you can tell time by the hour hand. Let your life be like the hour hand  of the watch, so true and steady that other girls and boys who daily  watch you may know life's time, may never be led astray.    MEMORY VERSE, I _Corinthians_ 15: 58        \"Therefore, be ye steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the      work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in      vain in the Lord.\"    MEMORY HYMN [385]        _\"Soldiers of the cross, arise_!\"          WHAT DID YOU SEE?      A few days ago I made a trip on the train. When I returned home one of  the first questions my little boy asked me was, \"What did you see?\" I  shall tell you what I told him.    Looking out of the car window I saw an immense field, acres and acres,  and in that field were planted hundreds, yes thousands, of little trees.  I inquired of the man who sat next me, \"What are those little trees  for?\" He said, \"They are growing those little trees to reforest the  desolate, burned over regions of the Adirondacks.\" I said to myself,  \"That is just what we are doing in my church. We are growing girls and  boys to reforest the needy places of the earth.\" I inquired, \"How long  do they keep those little trees there?\" \"Not very long,\" said he, \"just  long enough to give them a good start. Then they transplant them.\" Again  I said to myself, \"That is exactly what we do. We keep the girls and  boys only a little while, then they are transplanted.\"    I had another question. \"When they transplant these little trees how do  they plant them, haphazard, every-which-way?\" \"No, indeed,\" was his  answer, \"they are planted in rows, and close together.\" Exactly what we  are doing in our church, I thought. We are growing our girls and boys,  and we are keeping them close together, because they are such a help to  one another, and there is great inspiration in numbers.    Looking out of the train window at those trees of future forests, I  thought of the verse in Isaiah, \"The mountains and the trees shall break  forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap  their hands.\" I can hear the mountains and the hills of the Adirondacks  singing because of the growing trees, and I hear the mountains and the  hills of earth singing because of the millions of growing girls and boys  who shall reforest the desolate places of earth.    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 92: 13        \"Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in      the courts of our God.\"    MEMORY HYMN [677]        _\"Saviour, like a shepherd lead us.\"_          KNIFE LESSONS      I have here a knife. It was given me by a friend, a token of his  affection and esteem, when I went aboard the steamer in Manila,  Philippine Islands, to return to the homeland. All these years since  then the knife has been on my study desk, daily teaching me. What  lessons does this knife teach?    First of all the knife tells me of Strength. The most important part of  this knife is what _I_ call the backbone. It is the main portion of the  knife to which all the blades are fastened, as well as the polished  pearl handle. This would be a weak and useless knife did it not have a  backbone. It says to me every day \"Be strong, stand up, have  convictions, be steadfast.\"    Lesson number two, Discipline. This knife has been subjected to many  trials and tests. The steel of which these blades are made had to go  through a hard, hot, trying process before they were tempered and fit to  take an edge and hold it. Sometimes I rebel about certain processes of  the days, then I think of my knife and learn from it the lesson of  discipline.    The third lesson this knife teaches me is Neatness. Now I can picture  the man who bought this knife. As he went into the store, he stood  before the glass show case wherein were displayed scores of different  kinds of knives. There were dark knives and light knives, big knives and  little knives. His eye caught this knife, with its graceful lines, its  smooth pearl handle, and he said, \"That is a neat knife, I'll take that  one.\" People are attracted to you by your neatness.    The fourth lesson is Usefulness. Really it is quite wonderful the  variety of uses to which this knife can be put. Here is a big blade, and  a small blade; here is a blade with a file; folded in the back is a tiny  pair of scissors. So the great test of life is its usefulness.    MEMORY VERSE, _I Corinthians_ 9: 22        \"I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save      some.\"    MEMORY HYMN [545]        _\"Jesus calls us.\"_          LETTERS      Who is the most popular man in your town? The Postman. Who is the man  who is most eagerly looked for as he comes down the street? The Postman.  Who receives, at every door where he stops, a most cordial welcome? The  Postman. I wonder if the thrill of getting a letter will ever pass away.  When you come home from school the first thing you do is to look on the  hall table to see if the Postman has brought you a letter. It is the  same when we grow up. No matter how many letters we may receive we never  get over the keen delight at having the Postman bring us letters.    Last Sunday afternoon you wrote your grandmother. You said, \"Only two  months more of school and then I am coming to see you, and all the  summer vacation I am going to play around your big house, and in the  barn, and across the fields, and through the woods.\" On your way to  school Monday morning, you posted that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14417"],[0,"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (#5)"],[1,"too,  Heal us! As thou art Saviour of the Lost,  Save also us, Apollo, being so tossed  With tempest! ... All ye Daemons of the Pale!  And Hermes! Hermes, mine own guardian, hail!  Herald beloved, to whom all heralds bow....  Ye Blessed Dead that sent us, receive now  In love your children whom the spear hath spared.    O House of Kings, O roof-tree thrice-endeared,  O solemn thrones! O gods that face the sun!  Now, now, if ever in the days foregone,  After these many years, with eyes that burn,  Give hail and glory to your King's return!  For Agamemnon cometh! A great light  Cometh to men and gods out of the night.    Grand greeting give him--aye, it need be grand--  Who, God's avenging mattock in his hand,  Hath wrecked Troy's towers and digged her soil beneath,  Till her gods' houses, they are things of death;  Her altars waste, and blasted every seed  Whence life might rise! So perfect is his deed,  So dire the yoke on Ilion he hath cast,  The first Atreides, King of Kings at last,  And happy among men! To whom we give  Honour most high above all things that live.    For Paris nor his guilty land can score  The deed they wrought above the pain they bore.  \"Spoiler and thief,\" he heard God's judgement pass;  Whereby he lost his plunder, and like grass  Mowed down his father's house and all his land;  And Troy pays twofold for the sin she planned.    LEADER.    Be glad, thou Herald of the Greek from Troy!    HERALD.    So glad, I am ready, if God will, to die!    LEADER.    Did love of this land work thee such distress?    HERALD.    The tears stand in mine eyes for happiness.    LEADER.    Sweet sorrow was it, then, that on you fell.    HERALD.    How sweet? I cannot read thy parable.    LEADER.    To pine again for them that loved you true.    HERALD.    Did ye then pine for us, as we for you?    LEADER.    The whole land's heart was dark, and groaned for thee.    HERALD.    Dark? For what cause? Why should such darkness be?    LEADER.    Silence in wrong is our best medicine here.    HERALD.    Your kings were gone. What others need you fear?    LEADER.    'Tis past! Like thee now, I could gladly die.    HERALD.    Even so! 'Tis past, and all is victory.  And, for our life in those long years, there were  Doubtless some grievous days, and some were fair.  Who but a god goes woundless all his way?....    Oh, could I tell the sick toil of the day,  The evil nights, scant decks ill-blanketed;  The rage and cursing when our daily bread  Came not! And then on land 'twas worse than all.  Our quarters close beneath the enemy's wall;  And rain--and from the ground the river dew--Wet,  always wet! Into our clothes it grew,  Plague-like, and bred foul beasts in every hair.    Would I could tell how ghastly midwinter  Stole down from Ida till the birds dropped dead!  Or the still heat, when on his noonday bed  The breathless blue sea sank without a wave!....    Why think of it? They are past and in the grave,  All those long troubles. For I think the slain  Care little if they sleep or rise again;  And we, the living, wherefore should we ache  With counting all our lost ones, till we wake  The old malignant fortunes? If Good-bye  Comes from their side, Why, let them go, say I.  Surely for us, who live, good doth prevail  Unchallenged, with no wavering of the scale;  Wherefore we vaunt unto these shining skies,  As wide o'er sea and land our glory flies:  \"By men of Argolis who conquered Troy,  These spoils, a memory and an ancient joy,  Are nailed in the gods' houses throughout Greece.\"  Which whoso readeth shall with praise increase  Our land, our kings, and God's grace manifold  Which made these marvels be.--My tale is told.    LEADER.    Indeed thou conquerest me. Men say, the light  In old men's eyes yet serves to learn aright.  But Clytemnestra and the House should hear  These tidings first, though I their health may share.      [_During the last words_ CLYTEMNESTRA _has entered from the Palace_.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Long since I lifted up my voice in joy,  When the first messenger from flaming Troy  Spake through the dark of sack and overthrow.  And mockers chid me: \"Because beacons show  On the hills, must Troy be fallen? Quickly born  Are women's hopes!\" Aye, many did me scorn;  Yet gave I sacrifice; and by my word  Through all the city our woman's cry was heard,  Lifted in blessing round the seats of God,  And slumbrous incense o'er the altars glowed  In fragrance.                And for thee, what need to tell  Thy further tale? My lord himself shall well  Instruct me. Yet, to give my lord and king  All reverent greeting at his homecoming--  What dearer dawn on woman's eyes can flame  Than this, which casteth wide her gate to acclaim  The husband whom God leadeth safe from war?--  Go, bear my lord this prayer: That fast and far  He haste him to this town which loves his name;  And in his castle may he find the same  Wife that he left, a watchdog of the hall,  True to one voice and fierce to others all;  A body and soul unchanged, no seal of his  Broke in the waiting years.--No thought of ease  Nor joy from other men hath touched my soul,  Nor shall touch, until bronze be dyed like wool.    A boast so faithful and so plain, I wot,  Spoke by a royal Queen doth shame her not.      [_Exit_ CLYTEMNESTRA.    LEADER.    Let thine ear mark her message. 'Tis of fair  Seeming, and craves a clear interpreter....  But, Herald, I would ask thee; tell me true  Of Menelaus. Shall he come with you,  Our land's beloved crown, untouched of ill?    HERALD.    I know not how to speak false words of weal  For friends to reap thereof a harvest true.    LEADER.    Canst speak of truth with comfort joined? Those two  Once parted, 'tis a gulf not lightly crossed.    HERALD.    Your king is vanished from the Achaian host,  He and his ship! Such comfort have I brought.    LEADER.    Sailed he alone from Troy? Or was he caught  By storms in the midst of you, and swept away?    HERALD.    Thou hast hit the truth; good marksman, as men say!  And long to suffer is but brief to tell.    LEADER.    How ran the sailors' talk? Did there prevail  One rumour, showing him alive or dead?    HERALD.    None knoweth, none hath tiding, save the head  Of Helios, ward and watcher of the world.    LEADER.    Then tell us of the storm. How, when God hurled  His anger, did it rise? How did it die?    HERALD.    It likes me not, a day of presage high  With dolorous tongue to stain. Those twain, I vow,  Stand best apart. When one with shuddering brow,  From armies lost, back beareth to his home  Word that the terror of her prayers is come;  One wound in her great heart, and many a fate  For many a home of men cast out to sate  The two-fold scourge that worketh Ares' lust,  Spear crossed with spear, dust wed with bloody dust;  Who walketh laden with such weight of wrong,  Why, let him, if he will, uplift the song  That is Hell's triumph. But to come as I  Am now come, laden with deliverance high,  Home to a land of peace and laughing eyes,  And mar all with that fury of the skies  Which made our Greeks curse God--how should this be?    Two enemies most ancient, Fire and Sea,  A sudden friendship swore, and proved their plight  By war on us poor sailors through that night  Of misery, when the horror of the wave  Towered over us, and winds from Strymon drave  Hull against hull, till good ships, by the horn  Of the mad whirlwind gored and overborne,  One here, one there, 'mid rain and blinding spray,  Like sheep by a devil herded, passed away.  And when the blessed Sun upraised his head,  We saw the Aegean waste a-foam with dead,  Dead men, dead ships, and spars disasterful.  Howbeit for us, our one unwounded hull  Out of that wrath was stolen or begged free  By some good spirit--sure no man was he!--  Who guided clear our helm; and on till now  Hath Saviour Fortune throned her on the prow.  No surge to mar our mooring, and no floor  Of rock to tear us when we made for shore.  Till, fled from that sea-hell, with the clear sun  Above us and all trust in fortune gone,  We drove like sheep about our brain the thoughts  Of that lost army, broken and scourged with knouts  Of evil. And, methinks, if there is breath  In them, they talk of us as gone to death--  How else?--and so say we of them! For thee,  Since Menelaues thy first care must be,  If by some word of Zeus, who wills not yet  To leave the old house for ever desolate,  Some ray of sunlight on a far-off sea  Lights him, yet green and living ... we may see  His ship some day in the harbour!--'Twas the word  Of truth ye asked me for, and truth ye have heard!      [_Exit_ HERALD. _The_ CHORUS _take position for the Third Stasimon_.    CHORUS.    (_Surely there was mystic meaning in the name_ HELENA, _meaning which was  fulfilled when she fled to Troy._)      Who was He who found for thee    That name, truthful utterly--  Was it One beyond our vision  Moving sure in pre-decision    Of man's doom his mystic lips?--    Calling thee, the Battle-wed,    Thee, the Strife-encompassed,  HELEN? Yea, in fate's derision,    Hell in cities, Hell in ships,  Hell in hearts of men they knew her,    When the dim and delicate fold    Of her curtains backward rolled,  And to sea, to sea, she threw her    In the West Wind's giant hold;  And with spear and sword behind her    Came the hunters in a flood,  Down the oarblade's viewless trail  Tracking, till in Simois' vale  Through the leaves they crept to find her,    A Wrath, a seed of blood.    (_The Trojans welcomed her with triumph and praised Alexander till at last  their song changed and they saw another meaning in Alexander's name  also._)      So the Name to Ilion came    On God's thought-fulfilling flame,  She a vengeance and a token  Of the unfaith to bread broken,    Of the hearth of God betrayed,      Against them whose voices swelled      Glorying in the prize they held  And the Spoiler's vaunt outspoken    And the song his brethren made  'Mid the bridal"]]]
