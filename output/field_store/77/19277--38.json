The German rubbed his old hands and hesitated.    \"Ah--well--ah--the--Dutch--you know--do not like people who walk--in  this country--ah!\"    \"My dear friend,\" said the stranger, laying his hand on the German's  arm, \"I should have bought myself another horse, but crossing, five days  ago, a full river, I lost my purse--a purse with five hundred pounds  in it. I spent five days on the bank of the river trying to find  it--couldn't. Paid a Kaffer nine pounds to go in and look for it at the  risk of his life--couldn't find it.\"    The German would have translated this information, but the Boer-woman  gave no ear.    \"No, no; he goes tonight. See how he looks at me--a poor unprotected  female! If he wrongs me, who is to do me right?\" cried Tant Sannie.    \"I think,\" said the German in an undertone, \"if you didn't look at her  quite so much it might be advisable. She--ah--she--might--imagine that  you liked her too well,--in fact--ah--\"    \"Certainly, my dear friend, certainly,\" said the stranger. \"I shall not  look at her.\"    Saying this, he turned his nose full upon a small Kaffer of two years  old. That small naked son of Ham became instantly so terrified that he  fled to his mother's blanket for protection, howling horribly.    Upon this the newcomer fixed his eyes pensively on the stamp-block,  folding his hands on the head of his cane. His boots were broken, but he  still had the cane of a gentleman.    \"You vagabonds se Engelschman!\" said Tant Sannie, looking straight at  him.    This was a near approach to plain English; but the man contemplated the  block abstractedly, wholly unconscious that any antagonism was being  displayed toward him.    \"You might not be a Scotchman or anything of that kind, might you?\"  suggested the German. \"It is the English that she hates.\"    \"My dear friend,\" said the stranger, \"I am Irish every inch of  me--father Irish, mother Irish. I've not a drop of English blood in my  veins.\"    \"And you might not be married, might you?\" persisted the German. \"If you  had a wife and children, now? Dutch people do not like those who are not  married.\"    \"Ah,\" said the stranger, looking tenderly at the block, \"I have a dear  wife and three sweet little children--two lovely girls and a noble boy.\"    This information having been conveyed to the Boer-woman, she, after some  further conversation, appeared slightly mollified; but remained firm to  her conviction that the man's designs were evil.    \"For, dear Lord!\" she cried; \"all Englishmen are ugly; but was there  ever such a red-rag-nosed thing with broken boots and crooked eyes  before? Take him to your room,\" she cried to the German; \"but all the  sin he does I lay at your door.\"    The German having told him how matters were arranged, the stranger made  a profound bow to Tant Sannie and followed his host, who led the way to  his own little room.    \"I thought she would come to her better self soon,\" the German said  joyously. \"Tant Sannie is not wholly bad, far from it, far.\" Then seeing  his companion cast a furtive glance at him, which he mistook for one of  surprise, he added quickly, \"Ah, yes, yes; we are all a primitive people  here--not very lofty. We deal not in titles. Every one is Tante and  Oom--aunt and uncle. This may be my room,\" he said, opening the door.  \"It is rough, the room is rough; not a palace--not quite. But it may be  better than the fields, a little better!\" he said, glancing round at his  companion. \"Come in, come in. There is something to eat--a mouthful: not  the fare of emperors or kings; but we do not starve, not yet,\" he  said, rubbing his hands together and looking round with a pleased,  half-nervous smile on his old face.    \"My friend, my dear friend,\" said the stranger, seizing him by the hand,  \"may the Lord bless you, the Lord bless and reward you--the God of the  fatherless and the stranger. But for you I would this night have slept  in the fields, with the dews of heaven upon my head.\"    Late that evening Lyndall came down to the cabin with the German's  rations. Through the tiny square window the light streamed forth, and  without knocking she raised the latch and entered. There was a fire  burning on the hearth, and it cast its ruddy glow over the little dingy  room, with its worm-eaten rafters and mud floor, and broken whitewashed  walls. A curious little place, filled with all manner of articles. Next  to the fire was a great toolbox; beyond that the little bookshelf with  its well-worn books; beyond that, in the corner, a heap of filled and  empty grain-bags. From the rafters hung down straps, riems, old boots,  bits of harness, and a string of onions. The bed was in another corner,  covered by a patchwork quilt of faded red lions, and divided from the  rest of the room by a blue curtain, now drawn back. On the mantelshelf  was an endless assortment of little bags and stones; and on the wall  hung a map of South Germany, with a red line drawn through it to show  where the German had wandered. This place was the one home the girls had  known for many a year. The house where Tant Sannie lived and ruled was  a place to sleep in, to eat in, not to be happy in. It was in vain she  told them they were grown too old to go there; every morning and evening  found them there. Were there not too many golden memories hanging about  the old place for them to leave it?    Long winter nights, when they had sat round the fire and roasted  potatoes, and asked riddles, and the old man had told of the little  German village, where, fifty years before, a little German boy had  played at snowballs, and had carried home the knitted stockings of a  little girl who afterward became Waldo's mother; did they not seem to  see the German peasant girls walking about with their wooden shoes and  yellow, braided hair, and the little children eating their suppers out  of little wooden bowls when the good mothers called them in to have  their milk and potatoes?    And were there not yet better times than these? Moonlight nights, when  they romped about the door, with the old man, yet more a child than any  of them, and laughed, till the old roof of the wagon-house rang?    Or, best of all, were there not warm, dark, starlight nights, when they  sat together on the doorstep, holding each other's hands, singing German  hymns, their voices rising clear in the still night air--till the German  would draw away his hand suddenly to wipe quickly a tear the children  must not see? Would they not sit looking up at the stars and talking of  them--of the dear Southern Cross, red, fiery Mars, Orion, with his belt,  and the Seven Mysterious Sisters--and fall to speculating over them?  How old are they? Who dwelt in them? And the old German would say  that perhaps the souls we loved lived in them; there, in that little  twinkling point was perhaps the little girl whose stockings he had  carried home; and the children would look up at it lovingly, and call it  \"Uncle Otto's star.\" Then they would fall to deeper speculations--of  the times and seasons wherein the heavens shall be rolled together as  a scroll, and the stars shall fall as a fig-tree casteth her untimely  figs, and there shall be time no longer: \"When the Son of man shall  come in His glory, and all His holy angels with Him.\" In lower and lower  tones they would talk, till at last they fell into whispers; then they  would wish good night softly, and walk home hushed and quiet.    Tonight, when Lyndall looked in, Waldo sat before the fire watching a  pot which simmered there, with his slate and pencil in his hand; his  father sat at the table buried in the columns of a three-weeks-old  newspaper; and the stranger lay stretched on the bed in the corner,  fast asleep, his mouth open, his great limbs stretched out loosely,  betokening much weariness. The girl put the rations down upon the table,  snuffed the candle, and stood looking at the figure on the bed.    \"Uncle Otto,\" she said presently, laying her hand down on the newspaper,  and causing the old German to look up over his glasses, \"how long did  that man say he had been walking?\"    \"Since this morning, poor fellow! A gentleman--not accustomed to  walking--horse died--poor fellow!\" said the German, pushing out his lip  and glancing commiseratingly over his spectacles in the direction of  the bed where the stranger lay, with his flabby double chin, and broken  boots through which the flesh shone.    \"And do you believe him, Uncle Otto?\"    \"Believe him? why of course I do. He himself told me the story three  times distinctly.\"    \"If,\" said the girl slowly, \"he had walked for only one day his boots  would not have looked so; and if--\"    \"If!\" said the German starting up in his chair, irritated that any one  should doubt such irrefragable evidence--\"if! Why, he told me himself!  Look how he lies there,\" added the German pathetically, \"worn out--poor  fellow! We have something for him though,\" pointing with his forefinger  over his shoulder to the saucepan that stood on the fire. \"We are not  cooks--not French cooks, not quite; but it's drinkable, drinkable, I  think; better than nothing, I think,\" he added, nodding his head in a  jocund manner that evinced his high estimation of the contents of  the saucepan and his profound satisfaction therein. \"Bish! bish! my  chicken,\" he said, as Lyndall tapped her little foot up and down upon  the floor. \"Bish! bish! my chicken, you will wake him.\"    He moved the candle so that his own head might intervene between it  and the sleeper's face; and, smoothing his newspaper, he adjusted his  spectacles to read.    The child's grey-black eyes rested on the figure on the bed, then turned  to the German, then rested on the figure again.    \"I think he is a liar. Good night, Uncle Otto,\" she said slowly, turning  to the door.    Long after she had gone the German folded his paper up methodically, and  put it in his pocket.    The stranger had not awakened to"]]]
