W. Nelson to Mr. J. A. Allen, under date of July 11,  1877:[19] \"I have met here [St. Michaels, Alaska] two gentlemen who  crossed the mountains from British Columbia and came to Fort Yukon  through British America, from whom I have derived some information about  the buffalo (_Bison americanus_) which will be of interest to you. These  gentlemen descended the Peace River, and on about the one hundred and  eighteenth degree of longitude made a portage to Hay River, directly  north. On this portage they saw thousands of buffalo skulls, and old  trails, in some instances 2 or 3 feet deep, leading east and west. They  wintered on Hay River near its entrance into Great Slave Lake, and here  found the buffalo still common, occupying a restricted territory along  the southern border of the lake. This was in 1871. They made inquiry  concerning the large number of skulls seen by them on the portage, and  learned that about fifty years before, snow fell to the estimated depth  of 14 feet, and so enveloped the animals that they perished by  thousands. It is asserted that these buffaloes are larger than those of  the plains.\"    [Note 19: American Naturalist, xi, p. 624.]    MINNESOTA AND WISCONSIN.--A line drawn from Winnipeg to Chicago, curving  slightly to the eastward in the middle portion, will very nearly define  the eastern boundary of the buffalo's range in Minnesota and Wisconsin.    ILLINOIS AND INDIANA.--The whole of these two States were formerly  inhabited by the buffalo, the fertile prairies of Illinois being  particularly suited to their needs. It is doubtful whether the range of  the species extended north of the northern boundary of Indiana, but  since southern Michigan was as well adapted to their support as Ohio or  Indiana, their absence from that State must have been due more to  accident than design.    OHIO.--The southern shore of Lake Erie forms part of the northern  boundary of the bison's range in the eastern United States. La Hontan  explored Lake Erie in 1687 and thus describes its southern shore: \"I can  not express what quantities of Deer and Turkeys are to be found in these  Woods, and in the vast Meads that lye upon the South side of the Lake.  At the bottom of the Lake we find beeves upon the Banks of two pleasant  Rivers that disembogue into it, without Cataracts or Rapid  Currents.\"[20] It thus appears that the southern shore of Lake Erie  forms part of the northern boundary of the buffalo's range in the  eastern United States.    [Note 20: J. A. Allen's _American Bisons_, p. 107.]    NEW YORK.--In regard to the presence of the bison in any portion of the  State of New York, Professor Allen considers the evidence as fairly  conclusive that it once existed in western New York, not only in the  vicinity of the eastern end of Lake Erie, where now stands the city of  Buffalo, at the mouth of a large creek of the same name, but also on the  shore of Lake Ontario, probably in Orleans County. In his monograph of  \"The American Bisons,\" page 107, he gives the following testimony and  conclusions on this point:    \"The occurrence of a stream in western New York, called Buffalo Creek,  which empties into the eastern end of Lake Erie, is commonly viewed as  traditional evidence of its occurrence at this point, but positive  testimony to this effect has thus far escaped me.    \"This locality, if it actually came so far eastward, must have formed  the eastern limit of its range along the lakes. I have found only highly  questionable allusions to the occurrence of buffaloes along the southern  shore of Lake Ontario. Keating, on the authority of Colhoun, however,  has cited a passage from Morton's \"New English Canaan\" as proof of their  former existence in the neighborhood of this lake. Morton's statement is  based on Indian reports, and the context gives sufficient evidence of  the general vagueness of his knowledge of the region of which he was  speaking. The passage, printed in 1637 is as follows: They [the Indians]  have also made descriptions of great heards of well growne beasts that  live about the parts of this lake [Erocoise] such as the Christian world  (untill this discovery) hath not bin made acquainted with. These Beasts  are of the bignesse of a Cowe, their flesh being very good foode, their  hides good lether, their fleeces very usefull, being a kinde of wolle as  fine almost as the wolle of the Beaver, and the Salvages doe make  garments thereof. It is tenne yeares since first the relation of these  things came to the eares of the English.' The 'beast' to which allusion  is here made [says Professor Allen] is unquestionably the buffalo, but  the locality of Lake 'Erocoise' is not so easily settled. Colhoun  regards it, and probably correctly, as identical with Lake Ontario. * *  * The extreme northeastern limit of the former range of the buffalo  seems to have been, as above stated, in western New York, near the  eastern end of Lake Erie. That it probably ranged thus far there is fair  evidence.\"    PENNSYLVANIA.--From the eastern end of Lake Erie the boundary of the  bison's habitat extends south into western Pennsylvania, to a marsh  called Buffalo Swamp on a map published by Peter Kalm in 1771. Professor  Allen says it \"is indicated as situated between the Alleghany River and  the West Branch of the Susquehanna, near the heads of the Licking and  Toby's Creeks (apparently the streams now called Oil Creek and Clarion  Creek).\" In this region there were at one time thousands of buffaloes.  While there is not at hand any positive evidence that the buffalo ever  inhabited the southwestern portion of Pennsylvania, its presence in the  locality mentioned above, and in West Virginia generally, on the south,  furnishes sufficient reason for extending the boundary so as to include  the southwestern portion of the State and connect with our starting  point, the District of Columbia.          III. ABUNDANCE.      Of all the quadrupeds that have lived upon the earth, probably no other  species has ever marshaled such innumerable hosts as those of the  American bison. It would have been as easy to count or to estimate the  number of leaves in a forest as to calculate the number of buffaloes  living at any given time during the history of the species previous to  1870. Even in South Central Africa, which has always been exceedingly  prolific in great herds of game, it is probable that all its quadrupeds  taken together on an equal area would never have more than equaled the  total number of buffalo in this country forty years ago.    To an African hunter, such a statement may seem incredible, but it  appears to be fully warranted by the literature of both branches of the  subject.    Not only did the buffalo formerly range eastward far into the forest  regions of western New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, the Carolinas, and  Georgia, but in some places it was so abundant as to cause remark. In  Mr. J. A. Allen's valuable monograph[21] appear a great number of  interesting historical references on this subject, as indeed to every  other relating to the buffalo, a few of which I will take the liberty of  quoting.    [Note 21: All who are especially interested in the life history of the  buffalo, both scientific and economical, will do well to consult Mr.  Allen's monograph, \"The American Bisons, Living and Extinct,\" if it be  accessible. Unfortunately it is a difficult matter for the general  reader to obtain it. A reprint of the work as originally published, but  omitting the map, plates, and such of the subject-matter as relates to  the extinct species, appears in Hayden's \"Report of the Geological  Survey of the Territories,\" for 1875 (pp. 443-587), but the volume has  for several years been out of print.    The memoir as originally published has the following titles:    _Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Kentucky.| N. S. Shaler, Director.|  Vol. I. Part II.|--| The American Bisons,| living and extinct.| By J. A.  Allen.| With twelve plates and map.|--| University press, Cambridge:|  Welch, Bigelow & Co.| 1876._    _Memoirs of the Museum of Comparative Zoology,| at Harvard College,  Cambridge, Mass.| Vol. IV.

Unfortunately both are of greater rarity than the reprint  referred to above.]    In the vicinity of the spot where the town of Clarion now stands, in  northwestern Pennsylvania, Mr. Thomas Ashe relates that one of the first  settlers built his log cabin near a salt spring which was visited by  buffaloes in such numbers that \"he supposed there could not have been  less than two thousand in the neighborhood of the spring.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17753"],[0,"On the Antiquity of the Chemical Art (#5)"],[1,"on  the Egyptian temples. The style of building, the sciences of astronomy,  music, and medicine were assiduously cultivated by both nations, and  there was direct intercourse between them, perhaps even before  historical time begins.    Rameses the Great (III.), called also Sesostris, fitted out not only war  ships but merchant vessels for the purpose of trading with India, in  B.C. 1235, and Wilkinson in his book on the Ancient Egyptians, tells us  that in 2000 B.C. there were no less than 400 ships trading to the  Persian Gulf. There is, after all, nothing surprising in this when we  remember the fact, which is, however, not generally known, I am afraid,  that under the reign of Pharoah Necho, a fleet of his ships safely  circumnavigated Africa, from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, this  being in advance of the celebrated voyage of Diaz and Vasco da Gama by  no less than 2100 years.    No less than seven centuries before Thales went to study in Egypt,  astronomical calculations were inscribed on the monuments at Thebes, so  that we can see how modern by comparison the Greek philosophy appears.    In a note Wilkinson says that \"The science of Medicine was one of the  earliest cultivated in Egypt. Athothes, the successor of Menes of the  first dynasty, is said to have written on the subject, and five papyri  on the subject have survived.    \"They are of the period of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties.    \"One known as the Papyrus Ebers, from its discoverer, is attributed to  the age of Kherpheres or Bikheres.    \"The second, that of Berlin, found in the reign of Usaphais of the first  dynasty, was completed by Senet or Sethenes of the second line.    \"The third, that of the British Museum, contains a receipt said to have  been mysteriously discovered in the reign of Cheops of the fourth  dynasty.       *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *    \"The curatives employed were ointments, drinks, plasters, fumigations  and clysters, and the drugs employed were taken from vegetables,  minerals, and animals.    \"Those for each draught were mixed together, pounded, boiled, and  strained through linen.    \"The doctors belonged to the sacred class, and were only permitted to  practice their own particular branch.    \"These were oculists, dentists, those who confined their practice to  diseases of the head, and those again who only attended to internal  diseases; they were paid from the public treasury, and were compelled,  before being permitted to practice, to study the precepts laid down by  their predecessors.\"    Homer, in the Odyssey, describes Egypt \"as a country whose fertile soil  produces an infinity of drugs, some salutary and some pernicious, where  each physician possesses knowledge above all other men.\"    The mixing of various drugs and minerals must have produced effects  which could not be lost on such observant men as the doctors must, from  their training, have been, and it would be absurd to suppose that some,  at least, of the simpler chemical decompositions and combinations were  not known to them.    The manufacture of glass would seem to have been very ancient amongst  the Egyptians, and the insufficiency of the old fable, of its discovery  by the fusing of blocks of stone in the fire is quite clear; besides,  Egyptian glass has been found which contains potash, and nothing is more  probable than that the nitrate of potash, found so plentifully in the  soil of India, was imported for this manufacture.    Precious stones or amulets with Sanscrit inscriptions have repeatedly  been found in tombs, which must date back to at least B.C. 1400.    In tracing back the history of Chemistry, we constantly find reference  to Hermes, Trismegistus, who would seem to be the god Thoth, or Taaut of  the Egyptians. The famous inscription of the Emerald table ascribes to  him the possession of three parts of the philosophy of the whole world.  I have been much struck with the resemblance of this god Taaut with the  Menu of the Hindoos, who also was credited with saving from destruction  by the flood the three Vedas, which were supposed to contain all that  was required for man's direction here below.    There would appear to have been also other Hermes, but if we look at the  condition of things which obtained in Egypt when the Pyramids of Memphis  are supposed to have been erected, within 300 years of the supposed date  of the deluge, and that the Beni Hassan tombs, about 300 years later,  depict the manners and customs of what we cannot help admitting, was a  highly civilized nation, we must be struck with the fact that the  distance of time between the deluge and the building of these pyramids  and tombs is so short, that it might be represented by a comparison of  our own date with those of Queen Elizabeth and Henry the Third.    Jackson in his \"Antiquities\" tells us that, Sanchoniatho states that the  most ancient Phoenician records show that letters were invented soon  after the dispersion of mankind, by Tsaut, the son of Mizor or Misraim,  who was the first Egyptian Hermes or Thoth. He went out of Phoenicia,  and first, with a colony of Mizrites, settled and reigned in Egypt, and,  according to Cicero, gave both laws and letters to the Egyptians.    This Hermes was born in the second generation after the flood, and was  not only the inventor of letters and writing, but he is also said to  have delineated the sacred characters or symbols of the elements and  planets, viz.,--sun, moon, earth, air, fire, water, &c.    These symbols are without doubt of very ancient origin, and Boerhaeve in  his Theory of Chemistry explains them hieroglyphically as follows:--        [Transcriber's Note:      The listed symbols are included in the \"images\" directory      accompanying the html version of this file.]    [Symbol: plus] Denotes anything sharp, gnawing, or corrosive; as vinegar  or fire: being supposed to be stuck around with barbed spikes.    [Symbol: sun] Denotes a perfect immutable simple body, such as gold,  which has nothing acrimonious or heterogeneous adhering to it.    [Symbol: first quarter moon] Denotes half gold, whose inside, if turned  outward, would make it entire gold, as having nothing foreign or  corrosive in it; which the alchemists observe of silver.    [Symbol: mercury] Denotes the inside to be pure gold, but the outer part  of the colour of silver and a corrosive underneath, which, if taken  away, would leave it mere gold, and this the adepts affirm of mercury.    [Symbol: female/venus] Denotes the chief part to be gold; whereto,  however, adheres another large, crude, corrosive part, which, if  removed, would leave the rest possessed with all the properties of gold,  and this the adepts affirm of copper.    [Symbol: male/mars] Likewise denotes gold at the bottom, but attended  with a great proportion of a sharp corrosive, sometimes amounting to a  half of the whole, whence half the character expresses acrimony; which,  accordingly, both alchemists and physicians observe of iron, and hence  that common opinion of the adepts that the aurum vivum, or gold of the  philosophers, is contained in iron, and that the universal medicine is  rather to be sought in this metal than in gold itself.    [Symbol: jupiter] Denotes half the matter of tin to be silver, the other  a crude corrosive acid, which is accordingly confirmed by the assayers;  tin proving almost as fixed as silver in the cupel, and discovering a  large quantity of crude sulphur well known to the alchemists.    [Symbol: saturn] Denotes almost the whole to be corrosive, but retaining  some resemblance with silver, which the artists very well know holds  true of lead.    [Symbol: earth] Denotes a chaos--world, or one thing which includes all:  this is the character of antimony, wherein is found gold, with plenty of  an arsenical corrosive.    The symbols, or at least some of them, may be traced even in the Chinese  characters for gold, silver, &c.    The connection of Egypt with India shortly after the Christian era is  distinctly indicated in the works of Apuleius. He lived in the early  part of the second century after Christ, and was educated first at  Carthage, then renowned as a school of literature. He then travelled  extensively in Greece, Asia, and Egypt, and became initiated into many  religious fraternities and an adept in their mysteries. He was admitted  a priest of the order of AEsculapius, and describes the ceremony of the  offering of the first-fruits by the priests of Isis, when the navigation  opened in spring. The vessel, which was to be set adrift upon the ocean  freighted with the offering, was splendidly decorated and covered with  hieroglyphics, and after having been \"_purified with a lighted torch, an  egg, and sulphur_,\" was allowed to sail away into the unknown as a  sacrifice to procure the safety of the convoy of ships which would soon  after start upon their voyage. These rites were of great antiquity.    He speaks, in his first tale, of a witch who, by means of her magic  charms, made not only her fellow-countrymen love her, but \"_the Indians  even_,\" and in his initiation into the mysteries of Isis, his robes  \"bore pictures of Indian serpents.\"    From what I have now laid before you, in what must necessarily be a very  imperfect manner, you will see that there is good reason to believe that  in the study of science and philosophy the Indian races were much in  advance of the Western nations. The age of science amongst them is very  great; we fail utterly in trying to find its beginning, unless we accept  the tradition which ascribes to Menu, their great lawgiver (who is  supposed to have been Noah), the saving of three out of the four divine  books or Vedas from the deluge. This would carry us back to the  Antediluvian times for the beginning of our investigations; but without  taking any such extreme view of the subject we will find traces of  science clearly marked out for us in"]]]
