'I scarcely understand what thou meanest,' I said, 'much less can I  answer thy question.'    'Did I not say truly that something is missing, whereby, as through a  breach in the ramparts, disease hath crept in to disturb thy mind? But,  tell me, dost thou remember the universal end towards which the aim of  all nature is directed?'    'I once heard,' said I, 'but sorrow hath dulled my recollection.'    'And yet thou knowest whence all things have proceeded.'    'Yes, that I know,' said I, 'and have answered that it is from God.'    'Yet how is it possible that thou knowest not what is the end of  existence, when thou dost understand its source and origin? However,  these disturbances of mind have force to shake a man's position, but  cannot pluck him up and root him altogether out of himself. But answer  this also, I pray thee: rememberest thou that thou art a man?'    'How should I not?' said I.    'Then, canst thou say what man is?'    'Is this thy question: Whether I know myself for a being endowed with  reason and subject to death? Surely I do acknowledge myself such.'    Then she: 'Dost know nothing else that thou art?'    'Nothing.'    'Now,' said she, 'I know another cause of thy disease, one, too, of  grave moment. Thou hast ceased to know thy own nature. So, then, I have  made full discovery both of the causes of thy sickness and the means of  restoring thy health. It is because forgetfulness of thyself hath  bewildered thy mind that thou hast bewailed thee as an exile, as one  stripped of the blessings that were his; it is because thou knowest not  the end of existence that thou deemest abominable and wicked men to be  happy and powerful; while, because thou hast forgotten by what means the  earth is governed, thou deemest that fortune's changes ebb and flow  without the restraint of a guiding hand. These are serious enough to  cause not sickness only, but even death; but, thanks be to the Author of  our health, the light of nature hath not yet left thee utterly. In thy  true judgment concerning the world's government, in that thou believest  it subject, not to the random drift of chance, but to divine reason, we  have the divine spark from which thy recovery may be hoped. Have, then,  no fear; from these weak embers the vital heat shall once more be  kindled within thee. But seeing that it is not yet time for strong  remedies, and that the mind is manifestly so constituted that when it  casts off true opinions it straightway puts on false, wherefrom arises a  cloud of confusion that disturbs its true vision, I will now try and  disperse these mists by mild and soothing application, that so the  darkness of misleading passion may be scattered, and thou mayst come to  discern the splendour of the true light.'        SONG VII.    THE PERTURBATIONS OF PASSION.          Stars shed no light        Through the black night,          When the clouds hide;      And the lashed wave,        If the winds rave          O'er ocean's tide,--        Though once serene        As day's fair sheen,--          Soon fouled and spoiled      By the storm's spite,        Shows to the sight          Turbid and soiled.        Oft the fair rill,        Down the steep hill          Seaward that strays,      Some tumbled block        Of fallen rock          Hinders and stays.        Then art thou fain        Clear and most plain          Truth to discern,      In the right way        Firmly to stay,          Nor from it turn?        Joy, hope and fear        Suffer not near,          Drive grief away:      Shackled and blind        And lost is the mind          Where these have sway.          BOOK II.    THE VANITY OF FORTUNE'S GIFTS           Summary         CH. I. Philosophy reproves Boethius for the foolishness of his       complaints against Fortune. Her very nature is caprice.--CH. II.       Philosophy in Fortune's name replies to Boethius' reproaches, and       proves that the gifts of Fortune are hers to give and to take       away.--CH. III. Boethius falls back upon his present sense of       misery. Philosophy reminds him of the brilliancy of his former       fortunes.--CH. IV. Boethius objects that the memory of past       happiness is the bitterest portion of the lot of the unhappy.       Philosophy shows that much is still left for which he may be       thankful. None enjoy perfect satisfaction with their lot. But       happiness depends not on anything which Fortune can give. It is to       be sought within.--CH. V. All the gifts of Fortune are external;       they can never truly be our own. Man cannot find his good in       worldly possessions. Riches bring anxiety and trouble.--CH. VI.       High place without virtue is an evil, not a good. Power is an empty       name.--CH. VII. Fame is a thing of little account when compared       with the immensity of the Universe and the endlessness of       Time.--CH. VIII. One service only can Fortune do, when she reveals       her own nature and distinguishes true friends from false.          BOOK II.        I.      Thereafter for awhile she remained silent; and when she had restored my  flagging attention by a moderate pause in her discourse, she thus began:  'If I have thoroughly ascertained the character and causes of thy  sickness, thou art pining with regretful longing for thy former fortune.  It is the change, as thou deemest, of this fortune that hath so wrought  upon thy mind. Well do I understand that Siren's manifold wiles, the  fatal charm of the friendship she pretends for her victims, so long as  she is scheming to entrap them--how she unexpectedly abandons them and  leaves them overwhelmed with insupportable grief. Bethink thee of her  nature, character, and deserts, and thou wilt soon acknowledge that in  her thou hast neither possessed, nor hast thou lost, aught of any worth.  Methinks I need not spend much pains in bringing this to thy mind,  since, even when she was still with thee, even while she was caressing  thee, thou usedst to assail her in manly terms, to rebuke her, with  maxims drawn from my holy treasure-house. But all sudden changes of  circumstances bring inevitably a certain commotion of spirit. Thus it  hath come to pass that thou also for awhile hast been parted from thy  mind's tranquillity. But it is time for thee to take and drain a  draught, soft and pleasant to the taste, which, as it penetrates within,  may prepare the way for stronger potions. Wherefore I call to my aid the  sweet persuasiveness of Rhetoric, who then only walketh in the right way  when she forsakes not my instructions, and Music, my handmaid, I bid to  join with her singing, now in lighter, now in graver strain.    'What is it, then, poor mortal, that hath cast thee into lamentation and  mourning? Some strange, unwonted sight, methinks, have thine eyes seen.  Thou deemest Fortune to have changed towards thee; thou mistakest. Such  ever were her ways, ever such her nature. Rather in her very mutability  hath she preserved towards thee her true constancy. Such was she when  she loaded thee with caresses, when she deluded thee with the  allurements of a false happiness. Thou hast found out how changeful is  the face of the blind goddess. She who still veils herself from others  hath fully discovered to thee her whole character. If thou likest her,  take her as she is, and do not complain. If thou abhorrest her perfidy,  turn from her in disdain, renounce her, for baneful are her delusions.  The very thing which is now the cause of thy great grief ought to have  brought thee tranquillity. Thou hast been forsaken by one of whom no one  can be sure that she will not forsake him. Or dost thou indeed set value  on a happiness that is certain to depart? Again I ask, Is Fortune's  presence dear to thee if she cannot be trusted to stay, and though she  will bring sorrow when she is gone? Why, if she cannot be kept at  pleasure, and if her flight overwhelms with calamity, what is this  fleeting visitant but a token of coming trouble? Truly it is not enough  to look only at what lies before the eyes; wisdom gauges the issues of  things, and this same mutability, with its two aspects, makes the  threats of Fortune void of terror, and her caresses little to be  desired. Finally, thou oughtest to bear with whatever takes place within  the boundaries of Fortune's demesne, when thou hast placed thy head  beneath her yoke. But if thou wishest to impose a law of staying and  departing on her whom thou hast of thine own accord chosen for thy  mistress, art thou not acting wrongfully, art thou not embittering by  impatience a lot which thou canst not alter? Didst thou commit thy sails  to the winds, thou wouldst voyage not whither thy intention was to go,  but whither the winds drave thee; didst thou entrust thy seed to the  fields, thou wouldst set off the fruitful years against the barren. Thou  hast resigned thyself to the sway of Fortune; thou must submit to thy  mistress's caprices. What! art thou verily striving to stay the swing  of the revolving wheel? Oh, stupidest of mortals, if it takes to  standing still, it ceases to be the wheel of Fortune.'        SONG I.    FORTUNE'S MALICE.          Mad Fortune sweeps along in wanton pride,      Uncertain as Euripus' surging tide;      Now tramples mighty kings beneath her feet;      Now sets the conquered in the victor's seat.      She heedeth not the wail of hapless woe,      But mocks the griefs that from her mischief flow.      Such is her sport; so proveth she her power;      And great the marvel, when in one brief hour      She shows her darling lifted high in bliss,      Then headlong plunged in misery's abyss.        II.      'Now I would fain also reason with thee a little in Fortune's own words.  Do thou observe whether her contentions be just. \"Man,\" she might say,  \"why dost thou pursue me with thy daily complainings?

But in order to think music it  is necessary to know it--in fact, music-thinking is impossible without  it. As it is no trouble to learn the scale, all of you should get it  fixed in the mind quickly and securely.    It is now possible for you to hear the scale without singing its tones  aloud. Listen and see if that is not so! Now think of the melodies you  know, the songs you sing, the pieces you play. You can sing them quite  loudly (_can_ you sing them?) or in a medium tone, or you can hum them  softly as if to yourself; or further yet, you can think them without  making the faintest sound, and every tone will be as plain as when you  sang it the loudest. Here, I can tell you that Beethoven wrote many of  his greatest works when he was so deaf that he could not hear the  music he made. Hence, he must have been able to write it out of his  thought just as he wanted it to sound. When you understand these steps  and ways you will then know about the beginning of music-thinking.    Let us inquire in this Talk what the piano has to do in our  music-thinking. What relation is there between the music in the mind  and the tones produced by the piano? It seems really as if the piano  were a photographic camera, making for us a picture of what we have  written,--a camera so subtle indeed, that it pictures not things we  can see and touch, but invisible things which exist only within us.  But faithful as the piano is in this, it may become the means of doing  us much injury. We may get into the habit of trusting the piano to  think for us, of making it do so, in fact. Instead of looking  carefully through the pages of our new music, reading and  understanding it with the mind, we run to the piano and with such  playing-skill as we have we sit down and use our hands instead of our  minds. Now a great many do that, young and old. But the only people  who have a chance to conceive their music rightly are the young; the  old, if they have not already learned to do it, never can. That is a  law which cannot be changed.    We have talked about listening so much that it should now be a settled  habit in us. If it is we are learning every day a little about tones,  their qualities and character. And we do this not alone by hearing the  tones, but by giving great heed to them. Let us now remember this:  listening is not of the ears but of the thoughts. It is thought  _concentrated_ upon hearing. The more this habit of tone-listening  goes on in us, the more power we shall get out of our ability to read  music. All these things help one another. We shall soon begin to  discover that we not only have thoughts about sounding-tones, but  about printed tones. This comes more as our knowledge of the scale  increases.    We can now learn one of the greatest and one of the most wonderful  truths of science: _Great knowledge of anything comes from never  ceasing to study the first steps._    The major scale, as we first learn it, seems a perfectly simple thing.  But if we think of it all our lives we shall never discover the  wonders there are in it. Hence, three simple rules for us to follow in  learning to think music are these:      1. To listen to all tones.      2. Never to stop studying the major scale.      3. To become accustomed to hear tones within.    If we are faithful to these we shall, with increasing study and  industry, become more and more independent of the piano. We shall  never think with our hands, nor depend upon anything outside of  ourselves for the meaning contained in printed tone-thought.    If now we join two things we shall get the strength of both united,  which is greater than of either alone.    If in our playing lessons we have only the very purest music (heart  music, remember), and if we are faithful in our simpler thinking  lessons, we shall gain the power not only of pure thought, but of  stronger and stronger thought. This comes of being daily in the  presence of great thoughts--for we are in the presence of great  thoughts when we study great music, or read a great poem, or look at a  great picture, or at a great building. All these things are but signs  made manifest,--that is to say, made plain to us--of the pure thought  of their makers.    Thomas Carlyle, a Scotch author of this century, spoke very truly when  he said:    \"Great men are profitable company; we cannot look upon a great man  without gaining something by him.\"[22]          CHAPTER VII.    WHAT WE SEE AND HEAR.        \"You must feel the mountains above you while you work upon your    little garden.\"--_Phillips Brooks._[23]    Somewhere else we shall have some definite lessons in music-thinking.  Let us then devote this Talk to finding out what is suggested to us by  the things we see and hear.    Once a boy wrote down little songs. When the people asked him how he  could do it, he replied by saying that he made his songs from thoughts  which most other people let slip. We have already talked about thought  and about learning to express it. If a person of pure thought will  only store it up and become able to express it properly, when the time  comes he can make little songs or many other things; for all things  are made of thought. The poem is stored-up thought expressed in words;  the great cathedral like the one at Winchester, in England, or the one  near the Rhine, at Cologne, in Germany, is stored-up thought expressed  in stone. So with the picture and the statue: they are stored-up  thought on canvas and in marble.[24] In short, we learn by looking at  great things just what the little ones are; and we know from poems and  buildings and the like, that these, and even commoner things, like a  well-kept garden, a tidy room, a carefully learned lesson, even a  smile on one's face result, every one of them, from stored-up thought.    We can consequently make a definition of THINGS by saying they are  what is thought. Things are made of thought. Even if you cannot  understand this fully now, keep it by you and as you grow older its  truth will be more and more clear. It will be luminous. Luminous is  just the word, for it comes from a word in another language and means  _light_. Now the better you understand things the more _light_ you  have about them. And out of this you can understand how well ignorance  has been compared with darkness. Hence, from the poem, the building,  the painting, the statue, and from commoner things we can learn, as it  was said in a previous Talk, that music is stored-up thought told in  beautiful tones.    Now let us heed the valuable part of all this. If poems, statues, and  all other beautiful things are made out of stored-up thought (and  commoner things are, too), we ought to be able, by studying the  things, to tell what kind of a person it was who thought them; or, in  other words, who made them. It is true, we can. We can tell all the  person's thought, so far as his art and principal work are concerned.  Nearly all his life is displayed in the works he makes. We can tell  the nature of the man, the amount of study he has done, but best of  all we can tell his meaning. The face tells all its past history to  one who knows how to look.[25] His intentions are everywhere as plain  as can be in what he does.    Thus you see there is more in a person's work than what we see at the  first glance. There are reflections in it as plain as those in a  mountain lake. And as the mountain lake reflects only what is _above_  it, so the work of the musician, of the artist, of any one in fact,  reflects those thoughts which forever hover above the others. Thoughts  of good, thoughts of evil, thoughts of generosity, thoughts of selfish  vanity, these, _and every other kind_, are so strongly reflected in  the work we do that they are often more plainly seen than the work  itself. And with the works of a great artist before us we may find out  not only what he did and what he knew, but what he felt _and even what  he did not want to say_.    We now know what music-thinking is. Also, we see why the young  musician needs to learn to think music. Really, he is not a musician  until he can think correctly in tone. And further than this, when we  have some understanding of music-thought we not only think about what  we play and hear, but we begin to inquire what story it tells and what  meaning it should convey. We begin to seek in music for the thought  and intention of the composer, and, little by little, even before we  know it, we begin to seek out what kind of mind and heart the composer  had. We begin really to study his character from the works he has left  us.    We have now taken the first really intelligent step toward knowing for  ourselves something about common and classic music. Later on, as our  ability increases, this will be of great value to us. We begin to see,  bit by bit, what the author intended. That is the real test of it all.  We do not want to find mere jingle in music, we want music that says  something. Even a very young child knows that \"eenty meenty meiny moe\"  is not real sense, though it is a pleasant string of sounds to say in  a game.    Thus we learn to look into what we hear and into what we see and try  to find how much thought there is in it, and the kind of thought it  is. We want to know if goodness is expressed; if the best work of the  man is before us, or if, for a lower reason, his selfishness and  vanity are most prominent. And let us remember that as we seek these  things in the works of others, so others of thoughtful kind will watch  our doings, our playing, our speech, our little habits, and all to see  what our intentions are each time we express ourselves. They will look  to see what thoughts we are putting into our doings, whether thoughts  of goodness or of selfishness. And our actions will always be just as  good as the thought we put into them.    Now a great and a common mistake is, that sometimes we"]]]
