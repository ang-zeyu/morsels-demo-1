How does  he make you feel the pleasure of it? Why is there more enjoyment in  eating out of doors than in eating in the house? Why does the author  sprinkle little French phrases through the piece? Is it a good plan to  use foreign phrases in this way? What kind of man is Monsieur Laguerre?  Review his story carefully. Why was the police agent murdered? Who  killed him? Why has Monsieur Laguerre never found out what became of  Cambier?    This selection deals with a number of different subjects: Why does it  not seem \"choppy\"? How does the author manage to link the different  parts together? How would you describe this piece to some one who had  not read it? Mr. Smith is an artist who paints in water-colors: do you  see how his painting influences his writing?

Imagine yourself taking a trip up the stream in a boat. Tell something  of the weather and the time of day. Speak briefly of the boat and its  occupants. Describe the first picturesque spot: the trees and flowers;  the buildings, if there are any; the reflections in the water; the  people that you see. Go on from point to point, describing the  particularly interesting places. Do not try to do too much. Vary your  account by telling of the boats you meet. Perhaps there will be some  brief dialogues that you can report, or some little adventures that you  can relate. Close your theme by telling of your arrival at your  destination, or of your turning about to go back down the stream.    =An Old Man with a History=:--Perhaps you can take this from real life;  or perhaps you know some interesting old man whose early adventures you  can imagine. Tell briefly how you happened to know the old man. Describe  him. Speak of his manners, his way of speaking; his character as it  appeared when you knew him. How did you learn his story? Imagine him  relating it. Where was he when he told it? How did he act? Was he  willing to tell the story, or did he have to be persuaded? Tell the  story simply and directly, in his words, breaking it now and then by a  comment or a question from the listener (or listeners). It might be well  to explain occasionally how the old man seemed to feel, what expressions  his face assumed, and what gestures he made. Go on thus to the end of  the story. Is it necessary for you to make any remarks at the last,  after the man has finished?    =A Country Inn=:--See the outline for a similar subject on page 229.

Even in the State of Maine, where it is  still a custom to maim a child for life by christening him Arioch or  Shadrach or Ephraim, nobody would dream of calling a boy \"Quite So.\" It  was merely a nickname which we gave him in camp; but it stuck to him  with such bur-like tenacity, and is so inseparable from my memory of  him, that I do not think I could write definitely of John Bladburn if I  were to call him anything but \"Quite So.\"    It was one night shortly after the first battle of Bull Run. The Army of  the Potomac, shattered, stunned, and forlorn, was back in its old  quarters behind the earth-works. The melancholy line of ambulances  bearing our wounded to Washington was not done creeping over Long  Bridge; the blue smocks and the gray still lay in windrows on the field  of Manassas; and the gloom that weighed down our hearts was like the fog  that stretched along the bosom of the Potomac, and infolded the valley  of the Shenandoah. A drizzling rain had set in at twilight, and, growing  bolder with the darkness, was beating a dismal tattoo on the tent,--the  tent of Mess 6, Company A, --th Regiment, N.Y. Volunteers. Our mess,  consisting originally of eight men, was reduced to four. Little Billy,  as one of the boys grimly remarked, had concluded to remain at  Manassas; Corporal Steele we had to leave at Fairfax Court-House, shot  through the hip; Hunter and Suydam we had said good-by to that  afternoon. \"Tell Johnny Reb,\" says Hunter, lifting up the leather  sidepiece of the ambulance, \"that I'll be back again as soon as I get a  new leg.\" But Suydam said nothing; he only unclosed his eyes languidly  and smiled farewell to us.    The four of us who were left alive and unhurt that shameful July day sat  gloomily smoking our brier-wood pipes, thinking our thoughts, and  listening to the rain pattering against the canvas. That, and the  occasional whine of a hungry cur, foraging on the outskirts of the camp  for a stray bone, alone broke the silence, save when a vicious drop of  rain detached itself meditatively from the ridge-pole of the tent, and  fell upon the wick of our tallow candle, making it \"cuss,\" as Ned Strong  described it. The candle was in the midst of one of its most profane  fits when Blakely, knocking the ashes from his pipe and addressing no  one in particular, but giving breath, unconsciously as it were, to the  result of his cogitations, observed that \"it was considerable of a  fizzle.\"    \"The 'on to Richmond' business?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I wonder what they'll do about it over yonder,\" said Curtis, pointing  over his right shoulder. By \"over yonder\" he meant the North in general  and Massachusetts especially. Curtis was a Boston boy, and his sense of  locality was so strong that, during all his wanderings in Virginia, I do  not believe there was a moment, day or night, when he could not have  made a bee-line for Faneuil Hall.    \"Do about it?\" cried Strong. \"They'll make about two hundred thousand  blue flannel trousers and send them along, each pair with a man in  it,--all the short men in the long trousers, and all the tall men in the  short ones,\" he added, ruefully contemplating his own leg-gear, which  scarcely reached to his ankles.    \"That's so,\" said Blakely. \"Just now, when I was tackling the commissary  for an extra candle, I saw a crowd of new fellows drawing blankets.\"    \"I say there, drop that!\" cried Strong. \"All right, sir, didn't know it  was you,\" he added hastily, seeing it was Lieutenant Haines who had  thrown back the flap of the tent, and let in a gust of wind and rain  that threatened the most serious bronchial consequences to our  discontented tallow dip.    \"You're to bunk in here,\" said the lieutenant, speaking to some one  outside. The some one stepped in, and Haines vanished in the darkness.    When Strong had succeeded in restoring the candle to consciousness, the  light fell upon a tall, shy-looking man of about thirty-five, with long,  hay-colored beard and mustache, upon which the rain-drops stood in  clusters, like the night-dew on patches of cobweb in a meadow. It was an  honest face, with unworldly sort of blue eyes, that looked out from  under the broad visor of the infantry cap. With a deferential glance  towards us, the new-comer unstrapped his knapsack, spread his blanket  over it, and sat down unobtrusively.    \"Rather damp night out,\" remarked Blakely, whose strong hand was  supposed to be conversation.    \"Quite so,\" replied the stranger, not curtly, but pleasantly, and with  an air as if he had said all there was to be said about it.    \"Come from the North recently?\" inquired Blakely, after a pause.    \"Yes.\"    \"From any place in particular?\"    \"Maine.\"    \"People considerably stirred up down there?\" continued Blakely,  determined not to give up.    \"Quite so.\"    Blakely threw a puzzled look over the tent, and seeing Ned Strong on the  broad grin, frowned severely. Strong instantly assumed an abstracted  air, and began humming softly,        \"I wish I was in Dixie.\"    \"The State of Maine,\" observed Blakely, with a certain defiance of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17162"],[0,"Mother Stories from the Old Testament (#5)"],[1,"g, in the hearing of all the people,  the blessings for obedience and the curses for disobedience, as God  had commanded.    [Illustration: THE ALTAR ON MOUNT EBAL.]          THE CITIES OF REFUGE.      Revenge is contrary to the teaching of Jesus Christ, \"If thine enemy  hunger, feed him,\" says the Saviour; but among the Israelites and  other eastern nations a different practice prevailed. If one slew  another, the kinsman of him that was slain felt bound to avenge his  relative, and to slay him that had done the deed. Sometimes people  were killed by accident, when it was clearly unjust that he who had  unwittingly killed another should be slain. To guard against the  innocent thus suffering, God commanded that \"cities of refuge\" should  be appointed, to which the slayer might flee, \"which killeth any  person at unawares.\"    These cities were six in number: Kedesh, Shechem, and Kirjath-arba, on  the west of Jordan; and Bezer, Ramoth, and Golan, on the east of that  river. They were so arranged that a few hours' rapid flight would  bring the slayer from any part of the land to one of the cities of  refuge. Jewish writers say that the roads leading to these cities were  always kept in good repair, and that guide-posts were placed at every  cross road with \"Refuge! Refuge!\" written upon them. But the man that  wilfully killed another was not sheltered. He was given up to the  avenger to be slain.    In our picture we see the slayer running to the city gate; the avenger  close behind, shooting arrows at him. He has thus far escaped, and two  or three more steps will place him in safety. But, once within the  city, he must not quit its refuge until the death of the high priest.  If he do so and the avenger find him he may be slain. But upon the  death of the high priest he will be allowed to return home, to dwell  in peace again.    [Illustration: FLEEING TO THE CITY OF REFUGE.]          JOSHUA'S EXHORTATION.      Exhortation seems a hard word, but it simply means to strongly urge to  good deeds, and this is what our artist shows Joshua to be doing.    Joshua is now an old man, and the Israelites are settled peaceably in  Canaan. He has called them before him, with their elders, and heads,  and judges, and officers. He tells them that he is old and about to  die, and reminds them of the land that has already been conquered and  divided among them, and of that which still remains to be conquered;  urging them to be \"very courageous to keep and to do all that is  written in the book of the law of Moses, that they turn not aside  therefrom to the right hand or to the left.\" He bids them take good  heed therefore unto themselves, that they love the Lord their God; and  warns them that if they go back and do wickedly, the anger of the Lord  will be kindled against them, and they will perish quickly from off  the good land which God has given them.    In his address, Joshua said, \"Ye know in all your hearts and in all  your souls, that not one good thing hath failed of all the good things  which the Lord your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass  unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.\" How faithful is God!  He never fails in His promises: and we are told He is unchangeable, so  that whatever He promises now He will fulfil, and whatever warnings He  gives will surely come to pass. How good is it to have this holy and  wise God for our Father, and to know that He promises abundantly to  bless all those that trust in the Saviour, Jesus Christ. But let us  take heed of the warnings against sin given in God's Holy Word.    [Illustration: JOSHUA EXHORTING THE PEOPLE.]          GIDEON AND THE FLEECE.      After the death of Joshua, the Israelites turned away from God, and  served idols. Therefore the evils came upon them of which they had  been warned by Moses and Joshua. But at different times God, seeing  their distress, raised up \"judges\" to deliver them from their enemies,  and to judge over them. The first of these judges was named Othniel.  He was Caleb's nephew. The last was Samuel. One that lived about one  hundred years before Samuel was named Gideon.    The Israelites were at this time in great trouble. They were hiding in  dens and caves because of the Midianites, who had conquered them and  overrun their country. When their corn was ripe these enemies came and  destroyed it, so altogether they were in sad plight. One day Gideon  was threshing wheat in a secluded place, so as to escape the notice of  the Midianites, when an angel from God appeared to him, bidding him to  go and save the Israelites from their foes. Gideon obeyed the command:  but before commencing the battle he much desired a sign from God  showing that He would give the Israelites the victory. The sign Gideon  asked for was, that when he laid a fleece of wool on the ground, if  the victory were to be his, then the fleece should be wet and the  ground dry. He placed the wool on the ground, and taking it up the  next morning found it wet, although the ground was dry. So he knew God  had answered him as he desired. But he was not quite satisfied. He  begged God for a second sign. This time the ground was to be wet and  the fleece of wool dry. God gave him this sign also: and then Gideon  felt sure that the Israelites would be victorious over the  Midianites.    [Illustration: EXAMINING THE FLEECE.]          THE DEFEAT OF THE MIDIANITES.      Large numbers of the Israelites gathered around Gideon, prepared to  fight against the Midianites, who were encamped in a valley, \"like  grasshoppers for multitude.\" How Gideon's host was reduced till only  three hundred men remained, and the wonderful dream he heard related,  when he and his servant went down as spies into the enemy's camp, are  recorded in the seventh chapter of Judges. It was not by their own  bravery or power that the Israelites were to overcome their enemies.  God was to give them the victory: and He chose Gideon and three  hundred men to overcome the great and mighty host of the Midianites.    Gideon divided his three hundred men into three companies, and put a  trumpet in every man's hand, and gave to each a pitcher with a lamp  inside. Then he said, \"Look on me, and do likewise: when I blow with a  trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on  every side of the camp, and say, 'The sword of the Lord and of  Gideon.'\" Gideon and the hundred men of his company approached the  enemy's camp by night, and the other two companies drew nigh also, so  that the Midianites where surrounded. Then all blew their trumpets,  broke their pitchers, held up their lamps (torches), and cried out as  they had been commanded.    The Midianites heard the trumpets' blast and the cry, and saw the  lights. They were thrown into confusion, and one fought against  another; then they fled, and were pursued by the Israelites, great  numbers of whom gathered together and followed after their flying  enemies. Thus the Midianites were overcome, and Israel had peace  during the lifetime of Gideon.    [Illustration: \"THE SWORD OF THE LORD, AND OF GIDEON.\"]          THE DEATH OF SAMSON.      Samson's birth was foretold by an angel. He was to grow up a Nazarite,  forbidden to drink strong drink, neither was his head to be shaved.  His strength was very great; but his marriage was sinful, and his  doings with the idolatrous Philistines terrible. Though an Israelite  and a judge, I fear much he sinned greatly against God. On one  occasion he went to Gaza, a city of the Philistines. The inhabitants  tried to take him, but he arose at midnight and carried away the gates  of their city. In our picture though he looks so strong, yet we see  chains on his legs, and he is blind! How came he to lose his sight and  be made a prisoner? I think it was owing to his sin and folly.    He became acquainted with a wicked woman, who enticed him to tell her  in what his great strength lay. Three times he told her falsely, but  at last he said that if the flowing locks of his hair were removed his  strength would depart. While he slept these locks were cut off, then  the Philistines burst in upon him, and when he arose to resist them,  he found that his strength was gone. Then his eyes were cruelly put  out, and he was bound with fetters of brass.    Our artist shows him blind, brought out to make sport at the  Philistines' feast. He is very sorrowful, and, I think, angry. He asks  the lad beside him to place his hands upon the pillars supporting the  house; then, his great strength returning, he bows himself with all  his might; the pillars break, the house falls, and Samson, with very  many of the Philistines, is crushed amid the ruins. Was not this a  terrible end to what might have been a noble life?    [Illustration: SAMSON MAKING SPORT FOR THE PHILISTINES.]          RUTH AND NAOMI.      Naomi was the wife of a Jew named Elimelech, who left his own city of  Bethlehem to go into the land of Moab, because there was a famine in  Canaan. Some time afterwards he died, leaving Naomi a widow with two  sons, all dwellers in a strange land. Her sons married two young women  belonging to Moab, whose names were Orpah and Ruth. After living there  about ten years Naomi's sons died also, leaving Orpah and Ruth widows,  along with their widowed mother-in-law. Then Naomi determined to  return to her own land. Orpah and Ruth accompanied Naomi some distance  on her journey; then she bade them to leave her, telling each to go  back to her mother's house in Moab, while she would pursue her way  alone to the land of Judah. They were unwilling to do so, saying they  would go with her to her land and people; but she urged them to  depart, assuring them that they would gain nothing by leaving their  own country to accompany her, and that they had better return to their  own homes. Then the story informs us--you will find it in the Bible,  in the Book of Ruth--that Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and departed;  but"]]]
