GERMANY WANTED MORE COLONIES.--Germany's commercial expansion came  after most of the world had been divided among the other nations. She  thought she must have more colonies to provide her with raw materials  and to give her markets for some of her surplus manufactures. Other  reasons why Germany wanted colonies were that she might obtain more  food, and that she might establish coaling stations for her navy, so  that it could protect her commerce, especially her food-carrying ships.  As the war has shown, Germany can hardly produce a full supply of food  for her own people.    The easiest way to get colonies seemed to be by making war against some  nation that already possessed them, in the hope that a victorious  Germany could seize the colonies she desired. On the other hand, without  war, she had gained some large colonies and was assured of others in  Africa, and she had secured a prevailing influence over the immense  domains of Turkey in Asia. By 1914 the Germans had more than half  completed a railroad through Turkey to the Persian Gulf, and expected  soon to dominate the eastern trade by the Berlin-Bagdad route.    [Illustration: THE BERLIN-BAGDAD RAILWAY]    GERMANY WANTED \"A PLACE IN THE SUN.\"--Germany was acknowledged to be  the strongest nation in continental Europe. Her position as a world  power, however, was disputed by Great Britain, both by reason of the  latter's control of the sea through her enormous fleet, and by reason of  Great Britain's numerous colonies all over the world. It was galling to  German pride to have to coal her ships at English coaling stations. She  wanted stations of her own. By bringing on a war that would humble  France to the dust and make Belgium a part of Germany, thus giving her a  chance to seize the colonies of France and Belgium, Germany would at  once attain a position in the world's affairs which would enable her to  challenge the power of any nation on earth.    THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.--German thinkers carried to an extreme  the theory of the survival of the fittest. This doctrine teaches that  all living things have reached their present forms through a gradual  development of those qualities which best fit them to live in their  present surroundings. Those that are best adapted live on, and produce a  new generation that are also well fitted to survive. Those that are not  fitted to their surroundings soon give up the struggle and die. The  Germans applied this same belief to nations, and claimed that only those  nations survived that could successfully meet world conditions. They  believed that war was an inevitable world condition, and that that  nation would survive that was best able to fight. They believed in war,  because they believed that just as nature removes the weak animal or  plant by an early death, so the weak nation should pay the penalty of  its weakness by being defeated in war and absorbed by the stronger one.  War would prove which nation was the most nearly perfect. The Germans  had no doubt that this nation was Germany. Acceptance of this belief by  the German people had much to do with bringing on the present war.    GERMANY WANTED TO GERMANIZE THE WORLD.--As a result of the reasoning  outlined in the last paragraph, German writers taught that those things  which were German--their speech, their literature, their religion,  their armies, in short the manners, customs, and thoughts of the  Germans--were the best possible manners, and customs, and thoughts.  These things all taken together are what is meant by _Kultur_  (kool-toor'),--not merely \"culture\" as the latter word is generally  used.    Since the Germans believed that their _Kultur_ was the highest stage of  human progress, the next step, according to the view of their leaders,  would be to Germanize all the rest of the nations of the earth by  imposing German _Kultur_ upon them. If possible, this was to be brought  about with the consent of the other nations; if not, then it was to be  imposed by force.        SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.--1.

Every one of the great European powers except  England maintained such an army, and yet Germany was the only one that  we can say had a militaristic government.    A more narrow definition of militarism is that form of government in  which the military power is in control, and with the slightest excuse  can and does override the civil authority. This had been the situation  in Germany for many years before the outbreak of the Great War.    Let us take a glance at the development of this sort of government.  After Napoleon conquered Prussia, early in the nineteenth century, one  of the conditions of peace was that Prussia should reduce her army to  not more than forty-two thousand men. In order that the country should  not again be so easily conquered, the king of Prussia enrolled the  permitted number of men for one year, then dismissed that group, and  enrolled another of the same size, and so on. Thus, in the course of ten  years, it would be possible for him to gather an army of four hundred  thousand men who had had at least one year of military training.    The officers of the army were drawn almost entirely from among the  land-owning nobility. The result was that there was gradually built up a  large class of military officers on the one hand, and, on the other, a  much larger class, the rank and file of the army. These men had become  used, in the army, to obeying implicitly all the commands of the  officers.    This led to several results. Since the officer class furnished also most  of the officials for the civil administration of the country, the  interests of the army came to be considered the same as the interests of  the country as a whole. A second result was that the governing class  desired to continue a system which gave them so much power over the  common people. We should perhaps consider as a third result the fact  that the possession of such a splendid and efficient military machine  tended to make its possessors arrogant and unyielding in their  intercourse with other nations.    COMPETITION IN ARMAMENTS.--After 1870 the German emperor was the  commander of the whole German army, which was organized and trained on  the Prussian model. The fact that Germany had such an efficient army  caused other nations to be in constant fear of attack. Therefore her  neighbors on the continent of Europe were led to organize similar armies  and make other preparations for defense.    Moreover, Germany in recent years formed a number of ambitious projects  of expansion and colonization which would probably bring her into  conflict with other countries. In order to assure herself of success,  Germany proceeded to enlarge and otherwise improve the organization and  equipment of her army. This led France and Russia to enlarge their  armies. So the competition went on.    GERMANY'S NAVY.--For over a century Great Britain's control of the  seas had been almost undisputed. In order to carry out her projects of  expansion, Germany required a fleet which, while perhaps not so large as  that of Great Britain, would be large enough to make the result of a  naval battle questionable. Huge money grants were obtained from the  German people, and for a time more battleships were built by Germany  than by England. England dared not permit the naval superiority to pass  into Germany's hands. The result was a competition in dreadnaught  building quite as feverish as the competition in armies. The building  and maintenance of these great fleets were a heavy burden upon the  people of both countries. England made several offers to limit the  competition by promising to build no ships in any year in which Germany  would build none, but Germany in every case refused to agree to the  plan.        SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.--1. Make a chart showing the      comparative sizes of European armies in 1914. 2. In the same      way compare the European navies in 1914. 3. What effect is      produced upon a country by an aristocratic military class? 4.      Compare the German military policy with that of the United      States. 5. Will disarmament be one of the good results of      this war?

During recent centuries improved means of communication and  transportation have brought all parts of the world closer together, and  there has grown up in the minds of many enlightened thinkers the idea  that the whole civilized world ought to be regarded as a community of  nations.

The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of  the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of  the hand of this Philistine.' And Saul said unto David, 'Go, and the  Lord be with thee.'    [Illustration: DAVID. _Academy of Fine Arts, Florence._]    \"And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass  upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. And David girded  his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not  proved it. And David said unto Saul, 'I cannot go with these; for I  have not proved them.' And David put them off him. And he took his  staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the  brook,... and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the  Philistine....    \"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained  him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance....  And the Philistine said to David, 'Come to me, and I will give thy  flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.' Then  said David to the Philistine, 'Thou comest to me with a sword, and  with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the  Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.  This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite  thee, and take thine head from thee.' ...    \"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew  nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet  the Philistine. And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a  stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that  the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the  earth. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a  stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword  in the hand of David. Therefore David ran, and stood upon the  Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath  thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the  Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.\"[7]    [Footnote 7: 1 Samuel, chapter xvii. verses 33-51.]    This heroic adventure of David is the subject of Michelangelo's  statue. The shepherd, having thrown off the king's armor, advances  naked and unhampered, carrying only the sling flung across his back.  The large muscular hand hanging by his side holds the piece of wood on  which the sling is hung. It is the hand that wrenched the lamb from  the lion's mouth and then seized the king of beasts himself by the  beard. The left hand, poised on the shoulder, holds the centre of the  sling where it bulges with the pebble. The youth scans the enemy  keenly, marking the spot at which to aim. In another moment the pebble  will be speeding on its way. His air of confidence makes us sure of  the victory. Determination like this must win the day.    Critics of sculpture tells us that the statue of David must have been  studied from a model of the age which Michelangelo imagined as that of  the shepherd lad at this time. The figure is that of a growing youth,  and although it is therefore not so beautiful as a type of perfectly  developed manhood, it has a rugged strength which makes it one of the  sculptor's most interesting works.          III    CUPID      In the mythology of ancient Greece there is no more popular figure  than the little god of love, Eros, more commonly known by the Latin  name Cupid. He was supposed to be the son of Venus, the goddess of  love and beauty, whom he attended. He was never without his bow and  quiver of arrows. Whoever was hit by one of his magic darts  straightway fell in love. The wound was at once a pain and a delight.  Some traditions say that he shot blindfolded,--his aim seemed often so  at random. Sometimes the one whom he wounded was apparently least  susceptible to love. Indeed, Cupid had the reputation of being rather  a mischievous fellow, fond of pranks.    One of these was at the expense of Apollo, the great sun god. Apollo  was himself a mighty archer, and had slain with his arrows the python  of Delphi. Proud of his victory, he mocked at the little god of love,  advising him to leave his arrows for the warlike, and content himself  with the torch of love. Cupid, vexed at the taunt, replied  threateningly, \"Thine arrows may strike all things else, Apollo, but  mine shall strike thee.\" So saying he drew from his quiver two arrows,  one of gold, to excite love, and one of lead, to repel it. With the  golden one he shot Apollo through the heart, with the leaden he shot  the nymph Daphne. So Apollo became nearly mad with love for Daphne,  but the maid fled from him with horror. He pursued her, and when he  was close upon her, she turned into a laurel-tree.    Cupid continued to work havoc with his arrows. Even his mother Venus  could not escape their power. One day, when frolicking with her boy,  she was wounded by one of the darts, and before the wound healed she  saw and loved Adonis. When that youth was killed in a struggle with a  wild boar, she was inconsolable.    Another romantic tragedy for which Cupid was responsible was the love  between Hero and Leander. These two young people lived in towns on  opposite sides of the Hellespont. Leander was one day worshipping in  the temple of Venus, in Hero's town, Sestos, when he saw Hero, and was  at that moment shot by Cupid's arrow. His love was returned, and every  night he swam across the channel to see his lady love, until one night  a tempest arose, and he was drowned. The waves bore his body to the  shore, where Hero found him, and in her despair threw herself into the  sea and was also drowned.    [Illustration: CUPID. _South Kensington Museum, London._]    Such legends as these were dear to the hearts of the Greeks. Their  poets and artists were very fond of the subject of Cupid. Now  Michelangelo's early artistic training was under the influence of the  Greek culture. He was an inmate of the household of Lorenzo de'  Medici, who was an ardent lover of all that was beautiful in Greek  art and literature. At the table of the prince the youth must often  have heard the old Greek myths related, and in the gardens he saw  splendid Greek marbles. It was natural, then, that among his early  works in sculpture he should choose the subject of Cupid. His idea  was, however, his own, and was not at all such as a Greek would have  imagined. Classic art always represented the god of love as a merry  little winged boy, while in this statue he is seen as a well-grown  youth. His face is strong and masterful, instead of innocently gay.    He has dropped on one knee to take an arrow from the ground. In his  raised left hand he holds the bow, of which we see only a portion. His  left leg is bent in position to rise again. Like David, he has an  abundance of bushy hair crowning his handsome head; his straight brows  and set mouth show the same determination of character. He stands for  love which is determined to win, for love which conquers every  obstacle, for love which is unerring in aim. It is a much nobler  conception than the mere passing fancy of which the old myth speaks.  Michelangelo was one who believed that               \"Love betters what is best,      Even here below, but more in heaven above.\"[8]    So he put into a pagan fancy a new and higher meaning.    [Footnote 8: one of Michelangelo's sonnets translated by Wordsworth.]    To understand fully the qualities of this work of art, one ought to  see it from many points of view, and study the lines. The long curve  of the right arm follows the curve of the right leg from hip to knee.  The bend of the left arm repeats the line made by the bend of the left  leg. The two extended arms together form a long line arching like the  curve of a bow.    From every standpoint all the lines are beautiful and harmonious. This  was the secret the Greeks had taught the young Italian sculptor. In  other respects he was entirely original. Cupid, like David, is in an  attitude of action. In another moment he will move. This was quite  different from the Greek sculpture, which always gives an impression  of repose.         NOTE.--There is a difference of opinion among       critics as to the subject of the statue at South Kensington.       Heath Wilson considered it an Apollo. The writer has       followed Symonds in calling it Cupid.         The size of the statue may be calculated from the foot rule       which lies across the pedestal in the picture.          IV    MOSES      In Michelangelo's statue of Moses the great Hebrew leader is  represented at the height of his career. He was a prophet, a poet, a  military commander, and a statesman. The story of his life will show  how all these qualities could be combined in one person.    At the time of his birth his people were in slavery to the Egyptians,  who cruelly oppressed them. Their numbers were increasing so rapidly  that it was feared they would soon outnumber their masters. So the  command went forth to drown every boy baby. Now the mother of Moses  had no mind to lose her boy, and \"when she could not longer hide him,  she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and  with pitch, and she put the child therein and laid it in the flags by  the river's brink. And his sister stood afar off, to know what would  be done to him.\"[9]    [Footnote 9: Exodus, chapter ii. verses 3, 4, Revised Version.]    Then a strange thing happened. The princess came to the river with her  maids for a bath, and finding the babe, was touched by his cries. The  sister came up as if by chance, and asked if she should seek a Hebrew  nurse for the child, and when the princess said Yes, she went  straight for her mother.    So Moses was adopted by an Egyptian princess, yet he was nurtured in  infancy by his own mother. This explains why, with all the Egyptian  learning acquired at court, he had still"]]]
