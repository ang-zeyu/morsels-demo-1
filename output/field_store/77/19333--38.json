If a nautical project is to be carried out with complete success, the  first element in the venture is discipline, and the early seafarers  believed this, as their successors have always done, especially during  the different periods of the sailing-ship era. A commander, if he  wishes to be successful in keeping the spirit of rebellion under, must  imbue those under him with a kind of awe. This only succeeds if the  commander has a magnetic and powerful will, combined with quick action  and sound, unhesitating judgment. All the greatest naval and military  chiefs have had and must have now these essential gifts of nature if  they are to be successful in their art. The man of dashing expediency  without judgment or knowledge is a great peril in any responsible  position. When either a ship or nation or anything else is in trouble,  it is the cool, calculating, orderly administrator, who never makes  chaos or destructive fuss, that succeeds. That is essential, and it is  only this type of person that so often saves both ships, armies, and  nations from inevitable destruction. The Duke of Wellington used to  say that \"In every case, the winning of a battle was always a damned  near thing.\" One of the most important characteristics of Drake's and  Hawkins' genius was their fearless accurate methods of putting the  fear of God into the Spaniards, both at sea and ashore. The mention of  their names made Philip's flesh creep. Even Admiral Santa Cruz, in  common with his compatriots, thought Drake was \"The Serpent\"--\"The  Devil.\" And the Spanish opinion of him helped Drake to win many a  tough battle. Amongst the thrilling examples are his dashes into  Corunna and Cadiz. Drake never took the risk before calculating the  cost and making certain of where the vulnerable weak spot of the enemy  lay, and when and where to strike it. The complete vanquishing of the  Armada is another instance of Drake's great qualities of slashing yet  sound judgment put accurately into effect.    Of course, the honours of the defeat of the Armada must always be  shared with other naval experts who had acquired their knowledge of  sea warfare in what is called the piratical line. But the spirit that  inflamed the whole British fleet was that of Drake, Hawkins,  Frobisher, Seymour, and Howard, and the inspiration came mainly from  the two former. On the Spanish side, as a naval battle, it was a  fiasco, a mere colossal clerical burlesque. Neither naval strategy nor  ordinary seamanship was in evidence on the part of the chief commander  or his admirals. The men fought with rough-and-tumble heroism. The  sailors were only second in quality to our own, but there was no plan  of battle, and the poor Duke of Medina Sidonia had neither knowledge  of naval affairs nor courage. Philip's theory seems to have been that  any lack of efficiency in the art of war by his commanders would be  made up by the spiritual encouragement of the priests dangling their  crucifixes about the decks amongst the sailors and soldiers, who had  been put through a course of instruction on spiritual efficacy before  sailing on their doomed expedition. They were made to believe that the  Spanish cause was so just that assistance would be given from God to  defeat the \"infernal devils\" and to invade their country.    This great battle transferred the sea supremacy from the Spanish to  the British, who have held it, with one interval, ever since, and will  continue to hold it, provided that Philip's theories of relying merely  on the help that comes from above be supplemented by, first, the  appointment of a proper head at the Admiralty with some nautical  instinct and knowledge of affairs; and secondly, the keeping up of an  efficient fleet, manned with efficient officers and men. Heaven helps  those who help themselves. No department of government can be properly  managed by novices. The reckless, experimental appointment of untried  men to positions of grave responsibility on which the happiness,  comfort, and life of the whole public may depend, and the very  existence of the country be put in jeopardy, is a gamble, and may be a  crime.    It is always risky to assume that any person holding authority in the  bigger affairs of life is in consequence an instrument of Providence.  Had the conception of the Armada and the organization of every detail  been put into the hands of experienced and trained experts with sound  judgment in naval matters, such as Admiral Santa Cruz, and had it not  been for Philip and his landsman ideas of the efficacy of priests and  crucifixes, and greenhorns such as the Duke of Medina Sidonia and his  landlubber colleagues, Spain might never have been involved in the  Armada fight, and if she had, it is scarcely likely that so appalling  a disaster could have come to her. Apart from any fighting, the fact  of having no better sea knowledge or judgment than to anchor the  Spanish ships in an open roadstead like Calais was courting the loss  of the whole Spanish fleet. One of the fundamental precautions of  seamanship is never to anchor on a lee shore or in an open roadstead,  without a means of escape. The dunderheaded Spanish commanders made  their extermination much more easy for the highly trained British  seamen of all grades, none of whom had any reason to hide their heads  in shame for any part they individually took in the complete ruin of  the Spanish Navy.    One cannot read the sordid story without feeling a pang of pity for  the proud men, such as Recaldo, who died on landing at Bilbao; or  Oquendo, whose home was at Santander. He refused to see his wife and  children, turned his face to the wall, and died of a broken heart  begotten of shame. The soldiers and sailors were so weak they could  not help themselves, and died in hundreds on the ships that crawled  back to Spain. The tragic fate of these vessels and their crews that  were dashed to pieces on the rocks of the Hebrides and Ireland added  greatly to the tale of horror. Philip was crushed, but was a man of  tender sympathies, and free from vindictive resentment against those  who were placed in charge of his terrific and ill-fated navy. He  worked and exhorted others to relieve the sufferers in every possible  way. He obviously regarded the disaster as a divine rebuke, and  submissively acquiesced with true Spanish indolence, saying that he  believed it to be the \"great purpose of Heaven.\"    On the authority of the Duke of Parma, \"The English regarded their  victory with modesty, and were languidly indifferent to their valour.\"  They looked upon the defeat of the Spanish Navy as a token of the  Ruler of all things being decidedly partial to the Protestant faith.  The Spaniards, as a whole, would not allow that Heaven was against  them or that the verdict was that of Providence. They declared that it  was entirely the result of the superior management of the English  ships and the fighting quality of their crews. With this chivalrous  testimonial no one could then or will now disagree. It was very  sporting of them to admit the superiority of the British ships and  seamanship.    Drake and his compeers had reason to be proud of their efforts in the  great naval contest. Their reputations were enhanced by it all over  the world, though never a sign or word came from themselves about  their gallantry. They looked upon these matters as mere incidents of  their enterprising lives.      II    But it is really in the lesser sea encounters, though they probably  had just as great results, that we become enthralled by Drake's  adventurous voyages. The Armada affair was more like the battle of  Trafalgar, one of the differences being that in the latter engagement  the Spanish ships did not risk going far into the open sea, but wisely  kept Cadiz open for retreat, which they availed themselves of after  receiving a dreadful pounding. Drake's voyage in the _Pelican_  excelled anything that had ever been accomplished by previous sea  rovers, and his expedition to the West Indies was a great feat. He  always had trouble with Queen Elizabeth about money when organizing  his voyages. Her Spanish brother-in-law's power was always in her  thoughts. He never allowed her to forget that if he were provoked he  would invade England, and notwithstanding her retort that England had  a long arm which he would do well to fear, her courage alternated with  some nervousness at times. Elizabeth was not so much concerned about  his threat of excommunication of her as the sly tricks in conjunction  with the Pope in spreading the spirit of rebellion in Ireland, and in  other ways conspiring against her. Her mood was at one time to defy  him, and at another conciliatory and fearful lest her pirate chiefs  should do anything to provoke Spanish susceptibilities. Drake was much  hampered by her moods when he wanted to get quickly to business, and  never lost an opportunity of slipping out of her reach when his  eloquence on the acquisition of untold wealth and the capture of some  of Philip's distant colonies had appealed to her boundless avarice and  made her conscience easy. His expedition to the West Indies might  never have been undertaken had he not been a dare-devil fellow, to  whom Burleigh's wink was as good as a nod to be off. He slipped out of  port unknown to her, and his first prize was a large Spanish ship  loaded with salt fish. He pounced upon her after passing Ushant, and  the excellent cargo was suitably distributed amongst the fleet.    There were 25 privateers, and a company of 2,500 men on this  expedition. All were volunteers, and represented every grade of  society, high and low. There was never any difficulty in getting a  supply of men.

In a general sense it  signifies a state; but it is properly applied to a free state, one in  which the people enjoy common rights and privileges. Hence every state  in the union is a commonwealth or republic.            State Governments.          Chapter V.    The Nature and Objects of a Constitution, and the Manner in which it is  made.        Sec.1. Of all the different forms of government which have existed, a  republican government, on the plan of that which has been established in  this country, is believed to be best adapted to secure the liberties of  a people, and to promote the general welfare. Under the reign of a wise  and virtuous ruler, the rights of person and property may be fully  enjoyed, and the people may be in a good degree prosperous. But the  requisite virtue and wisdom have seldom been found in any one man or a  few men. And experience has proved that the objects of civil government  may be best secured by a written constitution founded upon the will or  consent of the people.    Sec.2. The word _constitute_ is from the Latin, and signifies _to set_, to  fix, to establish. _Constitution_, when used in a political sense, means  the established form of government of a state. In a free government,  like ours, it is properly called the _political law_, being established  by the people as a body politic, or political body. (Chap. III,  Sec.5.) It is also called the _fundamental law_, because it is the  _foundation_ of all other laws of the state, which are enacted by the  legislature for regulating intercourse between the citizens, and are  called the _municipal_ or _civil_ law, and must conform to the  fundamental, or political law.    Sec.3. A constitution is in the nature of an agreement between a whole  community or body politic and each of its members. This agreement or  contract implies, that each one binds himself to the whole, and the  whole bind themselves to each one, that all shall be governed by certain  laws and regulations for the common good.    Sec.4. The nature of a constitution will further appear from the manner in  which it is made. It is evident that a people, in establishing a  constitution, must have some right or authority to act in the business.  Whence this right is derived, we will not now stop to inquire. There is,  however, somewhere power to enact a law authorizing the people to make a  constitution and prescribing the manner in which it is to be made.    Sec.5. In forming a constitution, the people must act collectively. But  their number is too large to meet in a single assembly. Therefore they  choose a small number to act for them. One or more are chosen in each  county, or smaller district, and are called delegates. A _delegate_ is a  person appointed by another with power to transact business as his  representative. The assembly composed of the delegates so elected, is  called _convention_; a name given to most public meetings other than  legislative assemblies. Delegate and representative are words of nearly  the same meaning. The latter, however, usually designates a person  chosen to assist in making the laws of the state.    Sec.6. The rules agreed upon by the convention as a basis of government,  are arranged in proper form. The several portions relating to the  different subjects are called articles, and numbered; and the articles  are divided into sections, which also are numbered. But what has been  thus prepared by the convention is not yet a constitution. It is only a  draft of one, and can not become a constitution without the consent of  the people to be given at an election. If a majority of the persons  voting at such election vote in favor of the proposed constitution, it  is adopted, and becomes the constitution of the state.    Sec.7. One of the most valuable rights of the people under a free  government, is the right to have a constitution of their own choice.  Indeed it is in this right that their freedom principally consists. It  is by the constitution that their rights are secured. All the people  join in establishing the constitution; but they do not all unite in  making and executing the laws; in other words, they do not themselves  administer the government; this is done by their representatives. But if  these should enact unjust and oppressive laws; the people, having by  their constitution reserved the right to displace them, may do so by  electing others in their stead.    Sec.8. In an absolute monarchy the people have no political rights--the  right to establish a form of government for themselves, and the right to  elect those who are to make and administer the laws. The monarch has  entire control over his subjects. He can take their lives and property  when he pleases. His will is their law; and he has at command a large  force of armed men to keep his people in subjection.    Sec.9. In a limited monarchy, the people have some political rights. Such a  monarchy is Great Britain. The king or sovereign is in a measure  restrained by laws; and he can not make laws alone. The laws are framed  and agreed to by parliament, and must be approved by the king or queen.  Parliament consists of two bodies of men, the house of lords and the  house of commons. The members of the latter are elected by the people,  who, in such election, exercise a political right.    Sec.10. But the political right of establishing a constitution or form of  government, is not enjoyed by the people of that country. They have no  written instrument, like ours, called constitution, adopted by the  people. What is there called the constitution, is the aggregate or sum  of laws, principles, and customs, which have been formed in the course  of centuries. There is therefore no restraint upon the power of  parliament; hence no law which may be enacted is contrary to the  constitution; and the people have not the same security against the  enactment of unjust laws as the people of the United States.          Chapter VI.    Qualifications of Electors; or, by whom Political Power is exercised in  the States of this Union.        Sec.1. One of the first provisions usually inserted in a constitution of a  free state, is that which declares who shall be allowed to take a part  in the government; that is, to whom the political power shall be  intrusted. As this power is exercised by voting at elections, the  constitution very properly prescribes the qualifications of electors,  or, in other words, declares what shall be necessary to entitle a man to  the right of voting, or the right of suffrage. When, therefore, we speak  of the people politically, we mean those only who are qualified  electors.    Sec.2. To be competent to exercise the right of suffrage, a person must be  a freeman, or, as we sometimes say, he should be his own master. While  under the control of a parent or guardian, he might be constrained to  act contrary to his own judgment. All our state constitutions,  therefore, give this right only to free male citizens of the age of  twenty-one years and upwards; twenty-one years being the age at which  young men become free to act for themselves.    Sec.3. But even if this freedom were obtained at an earlier age, it would  not be expedient to bestow this right upon persons so young. They have  not the necessary knowledge and judgment to act with discretion. Some  are competent at an earlier age; but a constitution can make no  distinction between citizens. It has therefore, in accordance with the  general opinion, fixed the time at the age of twenty-one, when men shall  be deemed capable of exercising the rights and performing the duties of  freemen.    Sec.4. That a man may vote understandingly, he must have resided long  enough in the state to have become acquainted with its government and  laws, and to have learned the character and qualifications of the  persons for whom he votes. State constitutions therefore require, that  electors shall have resided in the state for a specified period of time,  varying, however, in the different states from three months to two  years. In most of the states, they must also have resided for some  months in the county or district, and be residents of the town in which  they offer to vote.    Sec.5. But in giving the right of suffrage to all free male citizens  twenty-one years of age, it is not given to every _man_, because all  _men_ of that age are not citizens. Persons born in foreign countries  and residing here are _aliens_, and are not entitled to the political  rights of persons born in this country. They are presumed to have too  little knowledge of our government, and to feel too little interest in  public affairs, on their first coming hither, to be duly qualified for  the exercise of political power. Laws, however, have been enacted for  naturalizing aliens after they shall have resided here long enough to  become acquainted with and attached to our government. By naturalization  they become citizens, entitled to all the privileges of native or  natural born citizens, (Chap. XXXIV, Sec.3, 4.)    Sec.6. The constitutions of most of the states confer the rights of an  elector on _white_ male citizens only. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,  Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, are the only states in which colored  men have the same electoral rights as white citizens. In New York, men  of color owning a freehold estate (an estate in lands) of the value of  $250, are qualified voters.    Sec.7. It is provided also in state constitutions, that electors committing  infamous crimes are disfranchised. _Franchise_ is a right or privilege  enjoyed by the citizens of a state. Hence the right of voting at  elections is called the _elective franchise_; and an elector, when  deprived of this privilege, is _disfranchised_. An _infamous crime_ is  one which is punishable by imprisonment in a state prison. Men guilty of  high"]]]
