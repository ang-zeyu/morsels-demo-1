He said: \"I have heard no  noise.\" But they assured him there was; and he resolved to keep waking  that night to try what he could hear. That being the third night and the  damsel being between hope and despair, she broke her plum, and it held  far the richest jewellery of the three. She bargained as before; and the  old wife, as before, took in the sleeping drink to the young knight's  chamber; but he told her he couldn't drink it that night without  sweetening. And when she went away for some honey to sweeten it with, he  poured out the drink, and so made the old wife think he had drunk it.  They all went to bed again, and the damsel began, as before, singing:         \"Seven long years I served for thee,        The glassy hill I clomb for thee,        Thy bloody clothes I wrang for thee;        And wilt thou not waken and turn to me?\"    He heard, and turned to her. And she told him all that had befallen  her, and he told her all that had happened to him. And he caused the old  washerwife and her daughter to be burnt. And they were married, and he  and she are living happy to this day for aught I know.          Yallery Brown      Once upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it wasn't in my  time, nor in your time, nor any one else's time, there was a young lad  of eighteen or so named Tom Tiver working on the Hall Farm. One Sunday  he was walking across the west field, 't was a beautiful July night,  warm and still and the air was full of little sounds as though the trees  and grass were chattering to themselves. And all at once there came a  bit ahead of him the pitifullest greetings ever he heard, sob, sobbing,  like a bairn spent with fear, and nigh heartbroken; breaking off into a  moan and then rising again in a long whimpering wailing that made him  feel sick to hark to it. He began to look everywhere for the poor  creature. \"It must be Sally Bratton's child,\" he thought to himself;  \"she was always a flighty thing, and never looked after it. Like as not,  she's flaunting about the lanes, and has clean forgot the babby.\" But  though he looked and looked, he could see nought. And presently the  whimpering got louder and stronger in the quietness, and he thought he  could make out words of some sort. He hearkened with all his ears, and  the sorry thing was saying words all mixed up with sobbing--    \"Ooh! the stone, the great big stone! ooh! the stones on top!\"    Naturally he wondered where the stone might be, and he looked again, and  there by the hedge bottom was a great flat stone, nigh buried in the  mools, and hid in the cotted grass and weeds. One of the stones was  called the \"Strangers' Table.\" However, down he fell on his knee-bones  by that stone, and hearkened again. Clearer than ever, but tired and  spent with greeting came the little sobbing voice--\"Ooh! ooh! the stone,  the stone on top.\" He was gey, and mis-liking to meddle with the thing,  but he couldn't stand the whimpering babby, and he tore like mad at the  stone, till he felt it lifting from the mools, and all at once it came  with a sough out o' the damp earth and the tangled grass and growing  things. And there in the hole lay a tiddy thing on its back, blinking up  at the moon and at him. 'T was no bigger than a year-old baby, but it  had long cotted hair and beard, twisted round and round its body so that  you couldn't see its clothes; and the hair was all yaller and shining  and silky, like a bairn's; but the face of it was old and as if 't were  hundreds of years since 't was young and smooth. Just a heap of  wrinkles, and two bright black eyne in the midst, set in a lot of  shining yaller hair; and the skin was the colour of the fresh turned  earth in the spring--brown as brown could be, and its bare hands and  feet were brown like the face of it. The greeting had stopped, but the  tears were standing on its cheek, and the tiddy thing looked mazed like  in the moonshine and the night air.    The creature's eyne got used like to the moonlight, and presently he  looked up in Tom's face as bold as ever was; \"Tom,\" says he, \"thou 'rt a  good lad!\" as cool as thou can think, says he, \"Tom, thou 'rt a good  lad!\" and his voice was soft and high and piping like a little bird  twittering.    Tom touched his hat, and began to think what he ought to say. \"Houts!\"  says the thing again, \"thou needn't be feared o' me; thou 'st done me a  better turn than thou know'st, my lad, and I'll do as much for thee.\"  Tom couldn't speak yet, but he thought; \"Lord! for sure 't is a bogle!\"    \"No!\" says he as quick as quick, \"I am no bogle, but ye 'd best not ask  me what I be; anyways I be a good friend o' thine.\" Tom's very  knee-bones struck, for certainly an ordinary body couldn't have known  what he'd been thinking to himself, but he looked so kind like, and  spoke so fair, that he made bold to get out, a bit quavery like--    \"Might I be axing to know your honour's name?\"    \"H'm,\" says he, pulling his beard; \"as for that\"--and he thought a  bit--\"ay so,\" he went on at last, \"Yallery Brown thou mayst call me,  Yallery Brown; 't is my nature seest thou, and as for a name 't will do  as any other. Yallery Brown, Tom, Yallery Brown's thy friend, my lad.\"    \"Thankee, master,\" says Tom, quite meek like.    \"And now,\" he says, \"I'm in a hurry to-night, but tell me quick, what'll  I do for thee? Wilt have a wife? I can give thee the finest lass in the  town. Wilt be rich? I'll give thee gold as much as thou can carry. Or  wilt have help wi' thy work? Only say the word.\"    Tom scratched his head. \"Well, as for a wife, I have no hankering after  such; they're but bothersome bodies, and I have women folk at home as  'll mend my clouts; and for gold that's as may be, but for work, there,  I can't abide work, and if thou 'lt give me a helpin' hand in it I'll  thank--\"    \"Stop,\" says he, quick as lightning, \"I'll help thee and welcome, but if  ever thou sayest that to me--if ever thou thankest me, see'st thou, thou  'lt never see me more. Mind that now; I want no thanks, I'll have no  thanks;\" and he stampt his tiddy foot on the earth and looked as wicked  as a raging bull.    \"Mind that now, great lump that thou be,\" he went on, calming down a  bit, \"and if ever thou need'st help, or get'st into trouble, call on me  and just say, 'Yallery Brown, come from the mools, I want thee!' and  I'll be wi' thee at once; and now,\" says he, picking a dandelion puff,  \"good-night to thee,\" and he blowed it up, and it all came into Tom's  eyne and ears. Soon as Tom could see again the tiddy creature was gone,  and but for the stone on end and the hole at his feet, he'd have thought  he'd been dreaming.    Well, Tom went home and to bed; and by the morning he'd nigh forgot all  about it. But when he went to the work, there was none to do! all was  done already, the horses seen to, the stables cleaned out, everything in  its proper place, and he'd nothing to do but sit with his hands in his  pockets. And so it went on day after day, all the work done by Yallery  Brown, and better done, too, than he could have done it himself. And if  the master gave him more work, he sat down, and the work did itself, the  singeing irons, or the broom, or what not, set to, and with ne'er a hand  put to it would get through in no time. For he never saw Yallery Brown  in daylight; only in the darklins he saw him hopping about, like a  Will-o-th'-wyke without his lanthorn.    At first 't was mighty fine for Tom; he'd nought to do and good pay for  it; but by-and-by things began to grow vicey-varsy. If the work was done  for Tom, 't was undone for the other lads; if his buckets were filled,  theirs were upset; if his tools were sharpened, theirs were blunted and  spoiled; if his horses were clean as daisies, theirs were splashed with  muck, and so on; day in and day out, 't was the same. And the lads saw  Yallery Brown flitting about o' nights, and they saw the things working  without hands o' days, and they saw that Tom's work was done for him,  and theirs undone for them; and naturally they begun to look shy on him,  and they wouldn't speak or come nigh him, and they carried tales to the  master and so things went from bad to worse.    For Tom could do nothing himself; the brooms wouldn't stay in his hand,  the plough ran away from him, the hoe kept out of his grip. He thought  that he'd do his own work after all, so that Yallery Brown would leave  him and his neighbours alone. But he couldn't--true as death he  couldn't. He could only sit by and look on, and have the cold shoulder  turned on him, while the unnatural thing was meddling with the others,  and working for him.    At last, things got so bad that the master gave Tom the sack, and if he  hadn't, all the rest of the lads would have sacked him, for they swore  they'd not stay on the same garth with Tom. Well, naturally Tom felt  bad; 't was a very good place, and good pay too; and he was fair mad  with Yallery Brown, as 'd got him into such a trouble. So Tom shook his  fist in the air and called out as loud as he could, \"Yallery Brown, come  from the mools; thou scamp, I want thee!\"    You'll scarce believe it, but he'd hardly brought out the words but he  felt something tweaking his leg behind, while he jumped with the smart  of it; and soon as he looked down, there was the tiddy thing, with his  shining hair, and wrinkled face, and wicked glinting black eyne.    Tom was in a fine rage, and he would have liked to have kicked him, but  't was no good, there wasn't enough of it to get his boot against; but he  said, \"Look here, master, I'll thank thee to leave me alone after this,  dost hear? I want none of thy help, and I'll have nought more to do with  thee--see now.\"    The horrid thing broke into a screeching laugh, and pointed its brown  finger at Tom. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#5)"],[1,"aimed at, and every touch and detail added in tune to  this idea, the comparison might have been different. But it is rarely  that good drawings are done this way. Fine things seem only to be seen  in flashes, and the nature that can carry over the impression of one of  these moments during the labour of a highly-wrought drawing is very  rare, and belongs to the few great ones of the craft alone.    It is difficult to know why one should be moved by the expression of  form; but it appears to have some physical influence over us. In looking  at a fine drawing, say of a strong man, we seem to identify ourselves  with it and feel a thrill of its strength in our own bodies, prompting  us to set our teeth, stiffen our frame, and exclaim \"That's fine.\" Or,  when looking at the drawing of a beautiful woman, we are softened by its  charm and feel in ourselves something of its sweetness as we exclaim,  \"How beautiful.\" The measure of the feeling in either case will be the  extent to which the artist has identified himself with the subject when  making the drawing, and has been impelled to select the expressive  elements in the forms.    Art thus enables us to experience life at second hand. The small man may  enjoy somewhat of the wider experience of the bigger man, and be  educated to appreciate in time a wider experience for himself. This is  the true justification for public picture galleries. Not so much for the  moral influence they exert, of which we have heard so much, but that  people may be led through the vision of the artist to enlarge their  experience of life. This enlarging of the experience is true education,  and a very different thing from the memorising of facts that so often  passes as such. In a way this may be said to be a moral influence, as a  larger mind is less likely to harbour small meannesses. But this is not  the kind of moral influence usually looked for by the many, who rather  demand a moral story told by the picture; a thing not always suitable to  artistic expression.    One is always profoundly impressed by the expression of a sense of bulk,  vastness, or mass in form. There is a feeling of being lifted out of  one's puny self to something bigger and more stable. It is this splendid  feeling of bigness in Michael Angelo's figures that is so satisfying.  One cannot come away from the contemplation of that wonderful ceiling of  his in the Vatican without the sense of having experienced something of  a larger life than one had known before. Never has the dignity of man  reached so high an expression in paint, a height that has been the  despair of all who have since tried to follow that lonely master. In  landscape also this expression of largeness is fine: one likes to feel  the weight and mass of the ground, the vastness of the sky and sea, the  bulk of a mountain.    On the other hand one is charmed also by the expression of lightness.  This may be noted in much of the work of Botticelli and the Italians of  the fifteenth century. Botticelli's figures seldom have any weight; they  drift about as if walking on air, giving a delightful feeling of  otherworldliness. The hands of the Madonna that hold the Child might be  holding flowers for any sense of support they express. It is, I think,  on this sense of lightness that a great deal of the exquisite charm of  Botticelli's drawing depends.    The feathery lightness of clouds and of draperies blown by the wind is  always pleasing, and Botticelli nearly always has a light wind passing  through his draperies to give them this sense.    As will be explained later, in connection with academic drawing, it is  eminently necessary for the student to train his eye accurately to  observe the forms of things by the most painstaking of drawings. In  these school studies feeling need not be considered, but only a cold  accuracy. In the same way a singer trains himself to sing scales, giving  every note exactly the same weight and preserving a most mechanical time  throughout, so that every note of his voice may be accurately under his  control and be equal to the subtlest variations he may afterwards  want to infuse into it at the dictates of feeling. For how can the  draughtsman, who does not know how to draw accurately the cold,  commonplace view of an object, hope to give expression to the subtle  differences presented by the same thing seen under the excitement of  strong feeling?    [Illustration: Plate V.    FROM A STUDY BY BOTTICELLI    In the Print Room at the British Museum.]    These academic drawings, too, should be as highly finished as hard  application can make them, so that the habit of minute visual expression  may be acquired. It will be needed later, when drawing of a finer kind  is attempted, and when in the heat of an emotional stimulus the artist  has no time to consider the smaller subtleties of drawing, which by then  should have become almost instinctive with him, leaving his mind free to  dwell on the bigger qualities.    Drawing, then, to be worthy of the name, must be more than what is  called accurate. It must present the form of things in a more vivid  manner than we ordinarily see them in nature. Every new draughtsman in  the history of art has discovered a new significance in the form of  common things, and given the world a new experience. He has represented  these qualities under the stimulus of the feeling they inspired in him,  hot and underlined, as it were, adding to the great book of sight the  world possesses in its art, a book by no means completed yet.    So that to say of a drawing, as is so often said, that it is not true  because it does not present the commonplace appearance of an object  accurately, may be foolish. Its accuracy depends on the completeness  with which it conveys the particular emotional significance that is the  object of the drawing. What this significance is will vary enormously  with the individual artist, but it is only by this standard that the  accuracy of the drawing can be judged.    It is this difference between scientific accuracy and artistic accuracy  that puzzles so many people. Science demands that phenomena be observed  with the unemotional accuracy of a weighing machine, while artistic  accuracy demands that things be observed by a sentient individual  recording the sensations produced in him by the phenomena of life. And  people with the scientific habit that is now so common among us, seeing  a picture or drawing in which what are called facts have been expressed  emotionally, are puzzled, if they are modest, or laugh at what they  consider a glaring mistake in drawing if they are not, when all the time  it may be their mistaken point of view that is at fault.    But while there is no absolute artistic standard by which accuracy of  drawing can be judged, as such standard must necessarily vary with the  artistic intention of each individual artist, this fact must not be  taken as an excuse for any obviously faulty drawing that incompetence  may produce, as is often done by students who when corrected say that  they \"saw it so.\" For there undoubtedly exists a rough physical standard  of rightness in drawing, any violent deviations from which, even at the  dictates of emotional expression, is productive of the grotesque. This  physical standard of accuracy in his work it is the business of the  student to acquire in his academic training; and every aid that science  can give by such studies as Perspective, Anatomy, and, in the case of  Landscape, even Geology and Botany, should be used to increase the  accuracy of his representations. For the strength of appeal in  artistic work will depend much on the power the artist possesses of  expressing himself through representations that arrest everyone by their  truth and naturalness. And although, when truth and naturalness exist  without any artistic expression, the result is of little account as art,  on the other hand, when truly artistic expression is clothed in  representations that offend our ideas of physical truth, it is only the  few who can forgive the offence for the sake of the genuine feeling they  perceive behind it.    [Illustration: Plate VI.    STUDY IN NATURAL RED CHALK BY ALFRED STEPHENS    From the collection of Charles Ricketts and Charles Shannon]    How far the necessities of expression may be allowed to override the  dictates of truth to physical structure in the appearance of objects  will always be a much debated point. In the best drawing the departures  from mechanical accuracy are so subtle that I have no doubt many will  deny the existence of such a thing altogether. Good artists of strong  natural inspiration and simple minds are often quite unconscious of  doing anything when painting, but are all the same as mechanically  accurate as possible.    Yet however much it may be advisable to let yourself go in artistic  work, during your academic training let your aim be #a searching  accuracy#.          III    VISION      It is necessary to say something about Vision in the first place, if we  are to have any grasp of the idea of form.    An act of vision is not so simple a matter as the student who asked her  master if she should \"paint nature as she saw nature\" would seem to have  thought. And his answer, \"Yes, madam, provided you don't see nature as  you paint nature,\" expressed the first difficulty the student of  painting has to face: the difficulty of learning to see.    Let us roughly examine what we know of vision. Science tells us that all  objects are made visible to us by means of light; and that white light,  by which we see things in what may be called their normal aspect, is  composed of all the colours of the solar spectrum, as may be seen in a  rainbow; a phenomenon caused, as everybody knows, by the sun's rays  being split up into their component parts.    This light travels in straight lines and, striking objects before us, is  reflected in all directions. Some of these"]]]
