Total value is the total  US dollar amount of imports on a c.i.f. or f.o.b. basis. Commodities  is a rank ordering of imported products starting with the most  important and sometimes includes the percent of dollar value. Partners  is a rank ordering of trading partners starting with the most  important and sometimes includes the percent of dollar value.    Independence: This entry gives the date that sovereignty was achieved  and from what nation.    Industrial production growth rate: This entry gives the annual  percentage increase in industrial production (includes manufacturing,  mining, and construction).    Industries: This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting  with the largest by value of annual output.    Infant mortality rate: This entry gives the number of deaths of  infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births  occurring in the same year. The infant mortality rate is often used an  indicator of the level of health in a country.    Inflation rate-consumer price index: This entry furnishes the annual  percent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's  consumer prices.    International disputes: see Disputes--international    International organization participation: This entry lists in  alphabetical order by abbreviation those international organizations  in which the subject country is a member or participates in some other  way.    International organizations: This information is presented in Appendix  C: International Organizations and Groups which includes the name,  abbreviation, address, telephone, FAX, date established, aim, and  members by category.    Introduction: This category includes two entries--Current issues and  Historical perspective.    Irrigated land: This entry gives the number of square kilometers of  land area that is artificially supplied with water.    Judicial branch: This entry contains the name(s) of the highest  court(s) and a brief description of the selection process for members.    Labor force: This entry contains the total labor force figure and a  rank ordering of component parts by occupation.    Land boundaries: This entry contains the total length of all land  boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous  border countries.    Land use: This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area  for five different types of land use. Arable land--land cultivated for  crops that are replanted after each harvest like wheat, maize, and  rice. Permanent crops--land cultivated for crops that are not  replanted after each harvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber.  Permanent pastures--land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops.  Forests and woodland--land under dense or open stands of trees.  Other--any land type not specifically mentioned above like urban  areas, roads, desert, etc.    Languages: This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting  with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total  population speaking that language.    Legal system: This entry contains a brief description of the legal  system's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of  International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.    Legislative branch: This entry contains information on the structure  (unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and  term of office. Elections includes the nature of election process or  accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next  election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number  of seats held by each party in the last election.    Life expectancy at birth: This entry contains the average number of  years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if  mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry  includes total population as well as the male and female components.  Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life  in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be  thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human  capital, and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial  measures.    Literacy: This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census  Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There  are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless  otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common  definition--the ability to read and write at a specified age.  Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the  ability to read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook.  Information on literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational  results, is probably the most easily available and valid for  international comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in  general, can impede the economic development of a country in the  current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.    Location: This entry identifies the country's regional location,  neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.    Map references: This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference  map on which a country may be found. The entry on Geographic  coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.    Maritime claims: This entry includes the following claims: contiguous  zone, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone, exclusive fishing  zone, extended fishing zone, none (usually for a landlocked country),  other (unique maritime claims like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line  or North Korea's Military Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The  proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from  being extended the full distance.    Merchant marine: Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged  in the carriage of goods; all commercial vessels (as opposed to all  nonmilitary ships) which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil  rigs, etc.; or a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or  register. This entry contains information in two subfields--total and  ships by type. Total includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or  over), total DWT for all ships, and total GRT for all ships. Ships by  type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo  ships, combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers,  container ships, intermodal ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock  carriers, multifunction large-load carriers, oil tankers, passenger  ships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo  ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,  specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and vehicle carriers.    Captive register is a register of ships maintained by a territory,  possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships  owned in the parent country; also referred to as an offshore register,  the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive  register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local  variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation  rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive  register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent  country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned  abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience  register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.    Flag of convenience register is a national register offering  registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major  flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue  of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal  manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having  relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the flag  state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a  given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority  of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an  open register.    Flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which holds  legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or  abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a ship  is crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on  the register.    Internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of a  national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national  flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of  maritime rules from those on the main national register. These  differences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign  nationals as crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag  state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian  International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are  the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been  instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of  convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and  Danish flags.    Merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of  freight; commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately  restricted to commercial vessels only.    Register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed  with the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of  such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides  it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country  in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of  the ship's ultimate owner.

He  took us another way, down canon after canon, so that we were able to  ride all the time and could make better speed. We came down out of the  snow and camped within twelve miles of home in an old, deserted ranch  house. We had grouse and sage chicken for supper. I was so anxious to  get home that I could hardly sleep, but at last I did and was only  awakened by the odor of coffee, and barely had time to wash before  Zebulon Pike called breakfast. Afterwards we fixed \"Jeems's\" pack so  that I could still ride, for Zebulon Pike was very anxious to get back  to his \"critters.\"    Poor, lonely, childlike little man! He tried to tell me how glad he had  been to entertain me. \"Why,\" he said, \"I was plumb glad to see you and  right sorry to have you go. Why, I would jist as soon talk to you as to  a nigger. Yes'm, I would. It has been almost as good as talking to old  Aunt Dilsey.\" If a Yankee had said the same to me I would have demanded  instant apology, but I know how the Southern heart longs for the dear,  kindly old \"niggers,\" so I came on homeward, thankful for the first  time that I can't talk correctly.    I got home at twelve and found, to my joy, that none of the men had  returned, so I am safe from their superiority for a while, at least.    With many apologies for this outrageous letter, I am      Your ex-Washlady,      ELINORE RUPERT.          V    SEDALIA AND REGALIA           _November 22, 1909._    MY DEAR FRIEND,--    I was dreadfully afraid that my last letter was too much for you and  now I feel plumb guilty. I really don't know how to write you, for I  have to write so much to say so little, and now that my last letter  made you sick I almost wish so many things didn't happen to me, for I  always want to tell you. Many things have happened since I last wrote,  and Zebulon Pike is not done for by any means, but I guess I will tell  you my newest experience.    I am making a wedding dress. Don't grin; it isn't mine,--worse luck!  But I must begin at the beginning. Just after I wrote you before, there  came a terrific storm which made me appreciate indoor coziness, but as  only Baby and I were at home I expected to be very lonely. The snow was  just whirling when I saw some one pass the window. I opened the door  and in came the dumpiest little woman and two daughters. She asked me  if I was \"Mis' Rupit.\" I told her that she had almost guessed it, and  then she introduced herself. She said she was \"Mis' Lane,\" that she had  heard there was a new stranger in the country, so she had brought her  twin girls, Sedalia and Regalia, to be neighborly. While they were  taking off their many coats and wraps it came out that they were from  Linwood, thirty miles away. I was powerful glad I had a pot roast and  some baked beans.    After we had put the horses in the barn we had dinner and I heard the  story of the girls' odd names. The mother is one of those \"comfy,\" fat  little women who remain happy and bubbling with fun in spite of hard  knocks. I had already fallen in love with Regalia, she is so jolly and  unaffected, so fat and so plain. Sedalia has a veneer of most  uncomfortable refinement. She was shocked because Gale ate all the  roast she wanted, and if I had been very sensitive I would have been in  tears, because I ate a helping more than Gale did.    But about the names. It seemed that \"Mis' Lane\" married quite young,  was an orphan, and had no one to tell her things she should have known.  She lived in Missouri, but about a year after her marriage the young  couple started overland for the West. It was in November, and one night  when they had reached the plains a real blue blizzard struck them.  \"Mis' Lane\" had been in pain all day and soon she knew what was the  matter. They were alone and it was a day's travel back to the last  house. The team had given out and the wind and sleet were seeing which  could do the most meanness. At last the poor man got a fire started and  a wagon sheet stretched in such a manner that it kept off the sleet. He  fixed a bed under the poor shelter and did all he could to keep the  fire from blowing away, and there, a few hours later, a little girl  baby was born. They melted sleet in the frying-pan to get water to wash  it. \"Mis' Lane\" kept feeling no better fast, and about the time they  got the poor baby dressed a second little one came.    That she told me herself is proof she didn't die, I guess, but it is  right hard to believe she didn't. Luckily the fire lasted until the  babies were dressed and the mother began to feel better, for there was  no wood. Soon the wind stopped and the snow fell steadily. It was  warmer, and the whole family snuggled up under the wagon sheet and  slept.    Mr. Lane is a powerful good husband. He waited two whole days for his  wife to gain strength before he resumed the journey, and on the third  morning he actually carried her to the wagon. Just think of it! Could  more be asked of any man?    Every turn of the wheels made poor \"Mis' Lane\" more homesick. Like Mrs.  Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, she had a taste for geographical names,  and \"Mis' Lane\" is very loyal, so she wanted to call the little  first-born \"Missouri.\" Mr. Lane said she might, but that if she did he  would call the other one \"Arkansas.\" Sometimes homesickness would  almost master her. She would hug up the little red baby and murmur  \"Missouri,\" and then daddy would growl playfully to \"Arkansas.\" It went  on that way for a long time and at last she remembered that Sedalia was  in Missouri, so she felt glad and really named the older baby  \"Sedalia.\" But she could think of nothing to match the name and was in  constant fear the father would name the other baby \"Little Rock.\"    For three years poor Gale was just \"t'other one.\" Then the Lanes went  to Green River where some lodge was having a parade. They were watching  the drill when a \"bystander that was standing by\" said something about  the \"fine regalia.\" Instantly \"Mis' Lane\" thought of her unnamed  child; so since that time Gale has had a name.    There could be no two people more unlike than the sisters. Sedalia is  really handsome, and she is thin. But she is vain, selfish, shallow,  and conceited. Gale is not even pretty, but she is clean and she is  honest. She does many little things that are not exactly polite, but  she is good and true. They both went to the barn with me to milk. Gale  tucked up her skirts and helped me. She said, \"I just love a stable,  with its hay and comfortable, contented cattle. I never go into one  without thinking of the little baby Christ. I almost expect to see a  little red baby in the straw every time I peek into a manger.\"    Sedalia answered, \"Well, for Heaven's sake, get out of the stable to  preach. Who wants to stand among these smelly cows all day?\"    They stayed with us almost a week, and one day when Gale and I were  milking she asked me to invite her to stay with me a month. She said  to ask her mother, and left her mother and myself much together. But  Sedalia stuck to her mother like a plaster and I just could not stand  Sedalia a whole month. However, I was spared all embarrassment, for  \"Mis' Lane\" asked me if I could not find work enough to keep Gale busy  for a month or two. She went on to explain that Sedalia was expecting  to be married and that Gale was so \"common\" she would really spoil the  match. I was surprised and indignant, especially as Sedalia sat and  listened so brazenly, so I said I thought Sedalia would need all the  help she could get to get married and that I should be glad to have  Gale visit me as long as she liked.    So Gale stayed on with me. One afternoon she had gone to the  post-office when I saw Mr. Patterson ride up. He went into the  bunk-house to wait until the men should come. Now, from something Gale  had said I fancied that Bob Patterson must be the right man. I am  afraid I am not very delicate about that kind of meddling, and while I  had been given to understand that Patterson was the man Sedalia  expected to marry, I didn't think any man would choose her if he could  get Gale, so I called him. We had a long chat and he told me frankly he  wanted Gale, but that she didn't care for him, and that they kept  throwing \"that danged Sedalia\" at him. Then he begged my pardon for  saying \"danged,\" but I told him I approved of the word when applied to  Sedalia, and broke the news to him that Gale was staying with me. He  fairly beamed. So that night I left Gale to wash dishes and Bob to help  her while I held Mr. Stewart a prisoner in the stable and questioned  him regarding Patterson's prospects and habits. I found both all that  need be, and told Mr. Stewart about my talk with Patterson, and he  said, \"Wooman, some day ye'll gang ploom daft.\" But he admitted he was  glad it was the \"bonny lassie, instead of the bony one.\" When we went  to the house Mr. Stewart said, \"Weel, when are you douchy bairns  gangin' to the kirk?\"    They left it to me, so I set Thanksgiving Day, and as there is no \"kirk  to gang to,\" we are going to have a justice of the peace and they are  to be married here. We are going to have the dandiest dinner that I can  cook, and Mr. Stewart went to town next day for the wedding dress, the  gayest plaid outside of Caledonia. But Gale has lots of sense and is  going to wear it. I have it almost finished, and while it doesn't look  just like a Worth model, still it looks plumb good for me to have made.  The boys are going up after Zebulon Pike, and Mr. Stewart is going  after \"Mis' Lane.\" Joy waves are radiating from this ranch and about  Thanksgiving morning one will strike you.    With lots of love and happy wishes,      Your ex-Washlady,      ELINORE RUPERT.          VI    A THANKSGIVING-DAY WEDDING      DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    ... I think every one enjoyed our Thanksgiving programme except poor  Gale. She was grieved, I verily believe, because Mr. Patterson is not  Mormon and could not take"]]]
