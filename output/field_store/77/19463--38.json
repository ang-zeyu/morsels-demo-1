They did not content themselves with an adoption of the principles  which lay at the foundation of all true philosophy, viz., that the  facts to be accounted for, _do exist_; that truth is eternal, and we are  to become acquainted with it by the means employed for its development.  They quitted the world of materiality they inhabited, refused to examine  the development of mind as the effect of an existing cause; and at one  bold push, entered the world of thought, and made the unhallowed attempt  to reason, a priori, concerning things which can only be known by their  manifestations. But they soon found themselves in a strange land,  confused with sights and sounds unknown, in the _explanation_ of which  they, of course, choose terms as unintelligible to their readers, as the  _ideal realities_ were to them. This course, adopted by Aristotle, has  been too closely followed by those who have come after him.[2] But a new  era has dawned upon the philosophy of the mind, and a corresponding  change in the method of inculcating the principles of language must  follow.[3]    In all our investigations we must take things as we find them, and  account for them as far as we can. It would be a thankless task to  attempt a change of principles in any thing. That would be an  encroachment of the Creator's rights. It belongs to mortals to use the  things they have as not abusing them; and to Deity to regulate the laws  by which those things are governed. And that man is the wisest, the  truest philosopher, and brightest Christian, who acquaints himself with  those laws as they do exist in the regulation of matter and mind, in the  promotion of physical and moral enjoyment, and endeavors to conform to  them in all his thoughts and actions.    From this apparent digression you will at once discover our object. We  must not endeavor to change the principles of language, but to  understand and explain them; to ascertain, as far as possible, the  actions of the mind in obtaining ideas, and the use of language in  expressing them. We may not be able to make our sentiments understood;  but if they are not, the fault will originate in no obscurity in the  facts themselves, but in our inability either to understand them or the  words employed in their expression. Having been in the habit of using  words with either no meaning or a wrong one, it may be difficult to  comprehend the subject of which they treat. A man may have a quantity of  sulphur, charcoal, and nitre, but it is not until he learns their  properties and combinations that he can make gunpowder. Let us then  adopt a careful and independent course of reasoning, resolved to meddle  with nothing we do not understand, and to use no words until we know  their meaning.    A complex idea is a combination of several simple ones, as a tree is  made up of roots, a trunk, branches, twigs, and leaves. And these again  may be divided into the wood, the bark, the sap, &c. Or we may employ  the botanical terms, and enumerate its external and internal parts and  qualities; the whole anatomy and physiology, as well as variety and  history of trees of that species, and show its characteristic  distinctions; for the mind receives a different impression on looking at  a maple, a birch, a poplar, a tamarisk, a sycamore, or hemlock. In this  way complex ideas are formed, distinct in their parts, but blended in a  common whole; and, in conformity with the law regulating language,  words, sounds or signs, are employed to express the complex whole, or  each distinctive part. The same may be said of all things of like  character. But this idea I will illustrate more at large before the  close of this lecture.    First impressions are produced by a view of material things, as we have  already seen; and the notion of action is obtained from a knowledge of  the changes these things undergo. The idea of quality and definition is  produced by contrast and comparison. Children soon learn the difference  between a sweet apple and a sour one, a white rose and a red one, a hard  seat and a soft one, harmonious sounds and those that are discordant, a  pleasant smell and one that is disagreeable. As the mind advances, the  application is varied, and they speak of a sweet rose, changing from  _taste_ and _sight_ to smell, of a sweet song, of a hard apple, &c.  According to the qualities thus learned, you may talk to them  intelligibly of the _sweetness_ of an apple, the _color_ of a rose, the  _hardness_ of iron, the _harmony_ of sounds, the _smell_ or scent of  things which possess that quality. As these agree or disagree with their  comfort, they will call them _good_ or _bad_, and speak of the qualities  of goodness and badness, as if possessed by the thing itself.    In this apparently indiscriminate use of words, the ideas remain  distinct; and each sign or object calls them up separately and  associates them together, till, at length, in the single object is  associated all the ideas entertained of its size, qualities, relations,  and affinities.    In this manner, after long, persevering toil, principles of thought are  fixed, and a foundation laid for the whole course of future thinking and  speaking. The ideas become less simple and distinct. Just as fast as the  mind advances in the knowledge of things, language keeps pace with the  ideas, and even goes beyond them, so that in process of time a single  term will not unfrequently represent a complexity of ideas, one of which  will signify a whole combination of things.    On the other hand, there are many instances where the single declaration  of a fact may convey to the untutored mind, a single thought or nearly  so, when the better cultivated will take into the account the whole  process by which it is effected. To illustrate: _a man killed a deer_.  Here the boy would see and imagine more than he is yet fully able to  comprehend. He will see the obvious fact that the man levels his musket,  the gun goes off with a loud report, and the deer falls and dies. How  this is all produced he does not understand, but knowing the fact he  asserts the single truth--the man killed the deer. As the child  advances, he will learn that the sentence conveys to the mind more than  he at first perceived. He now understands how it was accomplished. The  man had a gun. Then he must go back to the gunsmith and see how it was  made, thence back to the iron taken from its bed, and wrought into bars;  all the processes by which it is brought into the shape of a gun, the  tools and machinery employed; the wood for the stock, its quality and  production; the size, form and color of the lock, the principle upon  which it moves; the flint, the effect produced by a collision with the  steel, or a percussion cap, and its composition; till he finds a single  gun in the hands of a man. The man is present with this gun. The motives  which brought him here; the movements of his limbs, regulated by the  determinations of the mind, and a thousand other such thoughts, might be  taken into the account. Then the deer, his size, form, color, manner of  living, next may claim a passing thought. But I need not enlarge. Here  they both stand. The man has just seen the deer. As quick as thought his  eye passes over the ground, sees the prey is within proper distance,  takes aim, pulls the trigger, that loosens a spring, which forces the  flint against the steel; this produces a spark, which ignites the  charcoal, and the sulphur and nitre combined, explode and force the wad,  which forces the ball from the gun, and is borne thro the air till it  reaches the deer, enters his body by displacing the skin and flesh,  deranges the animal functions, and death ensues. The whole and much more  is expressed in the single phrase, \"a man killed a deer.\"    It would be needless for me to stop here, and examine all the operations  of the mind in coming at this state of knowledge. That is not the object  of the present work. Such a duty belongs to another treatise, which may  some day be undertaken, on logic and the science of the mind. The hint  here given will enable you to perceive how the mind expands, and how  language keeps pace with every advancing step, and, also, how  combinations are made from simple things, as a house is made of timber,  boards, shingles, nails, and paints; or of bricks, stone, and mortar; as  the case may be, and when completed, a single term may express the  idea, and you speak of a wood, or a brick house. Following this  suggestion, by tracing the operations of the mind in the young child, or  your own, very minutely, in the acquisition of any knowledge before  wholly unknown to you, as a new language, or a new science; botany,  mineralogy, chemistry, or phrenology; you will readily discover how the  mind receives new impressions of things, and a new vocabulary is adopted  to express the ideas formed of plants, minerals, chemical properties,  and the development of the capacities of the mind as depending on  material organs; how these things are changed and combined; and how  their existence and qualities, changes and combinations, are expressed  by words, to be retained, or conveyed to other minds.    But suppose you talk to a person wholly unacquainted with these things,  will he understand you? Talk to him of stamens, pistils, calyxes; of  monandria, diandria, triandria; of gypsum, talc, calcareous spar,  quartz, topaz, mica, garnet, pyrites, hornblende, augite, actynolite; of  hexahedral, prismatic, rhomboidal, dodecahedral; of acids and alkalies;  of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon; of the configuration of the  brain, and its relative powers; do all this, and what will he know of  your meaning? So of all science. Words are to be understood from the  things they are employed to represent. You may as well talk to a man in  the hebrew, chinese, or choctaw languages, as in our own, if he does not  know what is signified by the words selected as the medium"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17606"],[0,"Throwing-sticks in the National Museum (#5)"],[1,"849.    [Illustration: Fig. 13. Yukon River throwing-stick, front and  back.]      PLATE XI.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 14. Throwing-stick from Saint Michael's. This specimen is  very noteworthy on account of the absence of the index-finger pocket, a  mark characteristic of the Vancouver type, Fig. 17. If the middle peg of  the Vancouver example were removed the resemblance would be close, but  the clumsy spur at the bottom of the shaft groove is Norton Sound rather  than Nunivak. Collected by Lucien M. Turner, at Saint Michael's, in  1876. Museum number, 24335.    [Illustration: Fig. 14. Saint Michael's throwing-stick, front  and back.]      PLATE XII.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 15. Nunivak type. The characteristic marks are the absence  of any cavity for the index finger, the nicely-fitting handle, the  disposition of the finger-pegs, and the delicate point on the ivory spur  at the bottom of the shaft groove. Collected by W.H. Dall, at Nunivak  Island, in 1874. Museum number, 16239. (This specimen is left-handed.)    [Illustration: Fig. 15. Nunivak Island throwing-stick, front  and back, left-handed.]      PLATE XIII.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 16. Specimen from Nunivak, right-handed. The cuts on the  front and back are noteworthy. Collected by W.H. Dall, at Nunivak  Island, in 1874. Museum number, 16238.    [Illustration: Fig. 16. Nunivak Island throwing-stick, front  and back.]      PLATE XIV.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 17. Specimen from Cape Vancouver. In all respects it is  like those of Nunivak, excepting a peg-rest for the little finger.  Collected by E.W. Nelson, at Cape Vancouver, in 1879. Museum number,  38669.    [Illustration: Fig. 17. Cape Vancouver throwing-stick, front  and back.]      PLATE XV.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Figs. 18, 19. Bristol Bay type. In no essential characters do  these sticks differ from those of Nunivak. The handle is smaller, and  they appear to have been made with steel tools. Fig. 18 collected by  C.L. McKay, at Bristol Bay, Alaska, in 1883. Museum number, 72398. Fig.  19 collected by William J. Fisher, at Kadiak, in 1884. Museum number,  90467.    [Illustration: Fig. 18. Bristol Bay throwing-stick, front and  back.  Fig. 19. Bristol Bay throwing-stick, front and back.]      PLATE XVI.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 20. Unalashkan throwing-stick. It would be better to call  this form the Southern type. The noticeable features in all our  specimens are the parallel sides, the hard material, thinness, the  carving for the fingers, but above all the reappearance of the eccentric  cavity for the index finger. This cavity is not a great perforation, as  in the Point Barrow type, but an eccentric pocket, a compromise between  the Northern cavity and that of the East. Collected by Sylvanus Bailey,  at Unalashka, in 1874. Museum number, 16076.    [Illustration: Fig. 20. Unalashkan throwing-stick, front and  back.]      PLATE XVII.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Figs. 21, 22. Throwing-sticks of the Southern type. Fig. 21 is  left-handed, collected by Dr. T.T. Minor, at Kadiak, in 1869. Museum  number, 7933. Fig. 22 collected by W.H. Dall, at Unalashka, in 1873.  Museum number, 12981. At Sitka two specimens were collected,  unfortunately not figured, with the following characters laid down in  the beginning of this paper: 1. Short, very narrow and deep, and carved  all over with devices. 2. No handle distinct from the body. 3, 4, 5, 6.  All wanting. 7. The index-finger cavity is near the center of the back,  very like a thimble. Indeed this is a very striking feature. 8. The  shaft groove occupies only the lower half of the upper surface. 9. The  spur for the end of the weapon shaft is a long piece of iron like a  knife-blade driven into the wood, with the edge toward the weapon  shaft.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.
