In japanning curved pieces, such as mud-guards,  etc., in hanging up the work in the oven see that the liquid does not  run to extremities and there form ugly blots or blotches of enamel.    When white or other light tones are used for japanning they are mixed  with japanners' varnish, and these require more careful heating in the  oven or stove than darker tints or brown or black.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Trough for Dipping Bedstead Frames and other  Large Work.]      ENAMELLING BEDSTEAD FRAMES AND SIMILAR LARGE PIECES.    At Fig. 1 is shown a trough in which large pieces, such as bedsteads,  bicycle frames, etc., are dipped or immersed. For the first-mentioned  class of work such high finish is not required as for bicycles, and  consequently the enamel need not be applied with a brush, nor will it  be necessary to rub down the work between each coat, but instead the  pieces can be literally dipped in the tank of liquid, then allowed to  drain on to the dripping-board--the superfluous enamel thus finding  its way back into the trough or tank, the dripped articles being  afterwards placed in the oven to harden. The trough must be of  sufficient dimensions to allow the pieces of work to be completely  immersed, and the dripping-board should be set at an angle of about  45 deg..    Bedstead frames will never require more than two coats and the  commoner class of goods only one. I would not advise the tradesman in  a small way of business to go to the expense of a trough, etc., as it  calls for much more room than is ordinarily available, but if he has  the necessary plant for bicycle work he can, of course, do an  occasional job of the other kind.      JAPANNING TIN, SUCH AS TEA-TRAYS AND SIMILAR GOODS.    For japanning sheet-iron articles, which are really tin goods, such as  tea-trays and similar things, first scour them well with a piece of  sandstone, which will effectually remove all the scales and make the  surface quite smooth. Then give the metal a coating of vegetable  black, which must be mixed with super black japan varnish, thinned  with turps, and well strained. Only a small quantity of this varnish  is necessary, as it will dry dead. The article must then be placed in  the stove to harden at a temperature of 212 deg. F., there to remain for  from ten to twelve hours. When taken out of the stove, the articles  must be allowed to get cold, after which they must be given a coat of  super black japan, which, if necessary, must be thinned with turps, a  stiff, short bristle brush being employed, and the varnish put on  sparingly, so that it will not \"run\" when it gets warm. Two coats of  this varnish on top of the vegetable black coating are usually  sufficient, when done properly, but a third coating much improves the  work, and from ten to twelve hours' hardening will be necessary  between each coating. The small lumps which will be more or less  certain to arise will require to be rubbed down between each  application by a small and smooth piece of pumice-stone.    If it is desired to add gold or bronze bands or any kind of floral or  other kind of fancy decorations, these are painted on, after the  ground japanning has been done, in japanners' gold size, and then the  gold leaf is applied, or the bronze or other metal powder is dusted  on, after which the objects so treated are again placed in the stove,  where they will not require to be kept near so long as for ordinary  japanning. After they have been removed, the gilt or bronzed portions  must be treated with a protecting coat of white spirit varnish.  Transfers can be applied in the same way.    Tinned iron goods are the most largely japanned, and for these brown  and black colours are principally employed. Both are obtained by the  use of brown japan, the metal having a preliminary coating of black  paint when black is required. Only one coating of brown japan is given  to cheap goods, but for better articles two or more are applied. For  these it is possible that a final dressing with pumice-stone, then  with rotten-stone, and rubbed with a piece of felt or cloth, or even  the palm of the hand, may be necessary, but as a rule not.    Large numbers of articles of the above description, such as tea-trays,  tea-canisters, cash-boxes, coal-boxes, and similar goods, are japanned  at Birmingham, and it is to such that the preceding instructions  apply.      ENAMELLING OLD WORK.    In all cases of re-enamelling old work, it is absolutely necessary to  remove all traces of the first enamelling, and if this has been well  done in the first instance, it will prove no mean job. The best way to  clean the work is to soak it in a strong \"lye\" of hot potash, when the  softened enamel can be wiped or brushed off--this latter method being  pursued in the more intricate and ungetatable portions of the work.  New work, which has not been enamelled, can be treated in the same way  for the removal of all grease, stains, finger-marks, etc., and too  much attention cannot be paid to the initial preparation of the  surface of the metal, to have it thoroughly even and smooth, as it  adds so much to the ultimate finish and appearance of the work. Plenty  of labour must be bestowed before the final coat, as any blemish will  show through this finishing, and so mar what would otherwise be a  highly satisfactory bit of work. In all kinds of bicycle work, whether  new or old, the most satisfactory results are obtained by the  application of at least two, and sometimes four or five, successive  coats of good but thin enamel, as this will impart the necessary  perfect coat, combined with durability, a high finish, and a good  colour. A good enamel should be sufficiently hard, so as not to be  scratched on the merest touch or rubbing. It will, of course, be  understood that no solder-work must be put into the stove, or the  pieces will separate. Should any of this work be discovered, the  pieces must be taken apart, and then brazed together before being  enamelled, and put in the stove.          SECTION IV.    THE ENAMELLING AND JAPANNING STOVE--PIGMENTS SUITABLE FOR JAPANNING  WITH NATURAL LACQUER--MODERN METHODS OF JAPANNING WITH NATURAL  JAPANESE LACQUER.      APPLIANCES AND APPARATUS USED IN JAPANNING AND ENAMELLING.    Besides the various enamels or japans and varnishes of various  colourings and the stove, which will be found described and  illustrated, together with the trough, in other pages, the worker will  need some iron pots or cauldrons in which to boil the potash \"lye\" for  the cleansing, more particularly, of old work, some iron ladles both  for this work and for pouring the japan on the articles to be covered  therewith, a few badger tools and brushes for small fine work, some  hooks for the stove, a pair of pliers, a few bits of broom handle cut  into short lengths and made taper, so as to fit into the tubes, etc.,  of bicycles and other work, so as to keep the hands as free from the  japan as possible, some emery powder, pumice-stone powder, tripoli,  putty powder, whiting, and a piece of felt or cloth. If he is also  doing any common work, a stumpy brush of bristles and a soft leather  will also be requisite, together with a file or two. These will about  comprise the whole of the articles required, not very expensive, all  of which will really not be required by a beginner.    Owing largely to the strides made in the cycle trade enamelling is  stoved by means of gas, and of this a plentiful supply is necessary.  Enamelling stoves may really be described as hot-air cupboards or  ovens, and for a stove which will answer most requirements--say one of  6 feet by 6 feet by 3-1/2 feet--six rows of atmospheric burners will  be necessary to heat it, while it will be also advisable to fix pipes  of 1-1/4 inch internal diameter from the gas meter to the stove. The  atmospheric burners can be made from the requisite number of pieces of  1-1/4-inch gas tube 3-1/2 feet in length, one end of each being  stopped, and having 1/3-inch holes drilled therein at intervals of  about 1 inch, the other end being left open for the insertion of  ordinary 3/8-inch brass gas taps. Another plan preferred by some  japanners is to have three rows of burners the full length of the  stove, which, under some circumstances, due to structural conditions,  will be found more suitable. Anyway, whatever the position of the  stove, allowance must be made for a temperature up to 400 deg. F. to be  raised. In old-fashioned ovens the heat is applied by means of  external flues, in which hot air or steam is circulated, but this  system is generally unsatisfactory, the supply of heat having to be  controlled by dampers or stop-cocks, and this has given place to the  gas apparatus. Another simple form of oven, though not one which I  shall recommend, is a species of sheet-iron box, which is encased by  another and larger box of the same shape, so placed that from 2 to 3  inches of interspace exists between the two boxes. To this interspace  heat is applied, and a flue will have to be affixed to this apparatus  to carry off the vapours which arise from the enamel or japan. For  amateur or intermittent jobbing work the oven illustrated in Figs. 2  and 3 is about as good as any, though to guard against fire it would  be as well to have a course of brickwork beneath the oven, while if  this is not possible on account of want of height, a sheet or so of  zinc or iron will help to mitigate the danger. It is also advisable,  if the apartment is a low-pitched one, to have a sheet of iron or zinc  suspended by four corner chains from the ceiling in order to protect  this from firing through the heat from the enamelling oven. Of course,  it will be understood that every portion of the stove must be put  together with rivets, no soldered work being permissible.

And the trout in that artificial lake passed all  belief.    Every time the boy passed, he stopped for a few remarks. Pound by  pound the trout in Lake Almanor grew larger. Sentence by sentence Jack  learned much that was useful, a little that was needful. There were  several routes to Lake Almanor, for instance. One could get in by way  of Chico, but the winter snow had not left the high summits, so that  route was unfeasible for the time being. The best way just now was by  the way of Quincy, a little town up near the head of Feather River  Canyon. The fare was only seven or eight dollars, and since the season  had opened one could get reduced rates for the round trip. That was  the way the friend of the peanut butcher had gone in--only he had  stopped off at Keddie and had gone up to the dam with a fellow he knew  that worked there. And he had brought back a trout that weighed  practically eight pounds, dressed. The peanut butcher knew; he had  seen it with his own eyes. They had it hanging in the window of the  California Market, and there was a crowd around the window all the  time. He knew; he had seen the crowd, and he had seen the fish; and he  knew the fellow who had caught it.    Unless he could go with a crowd, Jack did not care much about fishing.  He liked the fun the gang could have together in the wilds, but that  was all; like last summer when Hen had run into the hornet's nest  hanging on a bush and thought it was an oriole's basket! Alone and  weighed down with horror as he was, Jack could not stir up any  enthusiasm for the sport. But he found out that it would not cost much  to reach the little town called Quincy, of which he had never before  heard.    No one, surely, would ever think of looking there for him. He could  take the evening train out of San Francisco, and in the morning he  would be there. And if he were not sufficiently lost in Quincy, he  could take to the mountains all around. There were mountains, he  guessed from what the boy had told him; and canyons and heavy timber.  The thought of having some definite, attainable goal cheered him so  much that he went to sleep again, sitting hunched down in the seat  with his hat over his eyes, so that no one could see his face; and  since no one but the man who sold it had ever seen him in that sport  suit, he felt almost safe.    He left the train reluctantly at the big, new station in San  Francisco, and took a street car to the ferry depot. There he kept out  of sight behind a newspaper in the entrance to the waiting room until  he was permitted to pass through the iron gate to the big, resounding  room where passengers for the train ferry were herded together like  corralled sheep. It seemed very quiet there, to be the terminal  station in a large city.    Jack judged nervously that people did not flock to the best fishing in  the State, in spite of all the peanut butcher had told him. He was  glad of that, so long as he was not so alone as to be conspicuous.  Aside from the thin sprinkling of passengers, everything was just as  the boy had told him. He was ferried in a big, empty boat across the  darkling bay to the train that stood backed down on the mole waiting  for him and the half dozen other passengers. He chose the rear seat in  another chair car very much like the one he had left, gave up his  ticket and was tagged, pulled his hat down over his nose and slept  again, stirring now and then because of his cramped legs.    When he awoke finally it was daylight, and the train was puffing into  a tunnel. He could see the engine dive into the black hole, dragging  the coaches after it like the tail of a snake. When they emerged,  Jack looked down upon a green-and-white-scurrying river; away down--so  far that it startled him a little. And he looked up steep pine-clad  slopes to the rugged peaks of the mountains. He heaved a sigh of  relief. Surely no one could possibly find him in a place like this.    After a while he was told to change for Quincy, and descended into a  fresh, green-and-blue world edged with white clouds. There was no  town--nothing but green hills and a deep-set, unbelievable valley  floor marked off with fences, and a little yellow station with a red  roof, and a toy engine panting importantly in front of its one tiny  baggage-and-passenger coach, with a freight car for ballast.    Jack threw back his shoulders and took a long, deep, satisfying  breath. He looked around him gloatingly and climbed into the little  make-believe train, and smiled as he settled back in a seat. There was  not another soul going to Quincy that morning, save the conductor and  engineer. The conductor looked at his passenger as boredly as the wife  of a professional humorist looks at her husband, took his ticket and  left him.    Jack lighted a cigarette and blew the smoke out of the open window  while the little train bore him down through the green forest into the  valley. He was in a new world. He was safe here--he was lost.          CHAPTER FOUR    JACK FINDS HIMSELF IN POSSESSION OF A JOB      Writing his name on the hotel register was an embarrassing ceremony  that had not occurred to Jack until he walked up the steps and into  the bare little office. Some instinct of pride made him shrink from  taking a name that did not belong to him, and he was afraid to write  his own in so public a place. So he ducked into the dining room whence  came the muffled clatter of dishes and an odor of fried beefsteak, as  a perfectly plausible means of dodging the issue for a while.    He ate as slowly as he dared and as long as he could swallow, and when  he left was lucky enough to find the office occupied only by a big  yellow cat curled up on the desk with the pen between its paws. It  seemed a shame to disturb the cat. He went by it on his toes and  passed on down the steps and into the full face of the town lying  there cupped in green hills and with a sunshiny quiet that made the  world seem farther away than ever.    A couple of men were walking down the street and stopping now and then  to talk to those they met. Jack followed aimlessly, his hands in his  pockets, his new Stetson--that did not look so unusual here in  Quincy--pulled well down over his eyebrows and giving his face an  unaccustomed look of purposefulness. Those he met carried letters and  papers in their hands; those he followed went empty handed, so Jack  guessed that he was observing the regular morning pilgrimage to the  postoffice--which, had he only known it, really begins the day in  Quincy.    He did not expect any mail, of course; but there seemed nothing else  for him to do, no other place for him to go; and he was afraid that if  he stayed around the hotel some one might ask him to register. He  went, therefore, to the postoffice and stood just outside the door  with his hands still in his pockets and the purposeful look on his  face; whereas no man was ever more completely adrift and purposeless  than was Jack Corey. Now that he had lost himself from the  world--buried himself up here in these wonderfully green mountains  where no one would ever think of looking for him--there seemed nothing  at all to do. He did not even want to go fishing. And as for  journeying on to that lake which the peanut butcher had talked so much  about, Jack had never for one minute intended going there.    A tall man with shrewd blue eyes twinkling behind goldrimmed glasses  came out and stood in the pleasant warmth of the sun. He had a lot of  mail under his arm and a San Francisco paper spread before him. Jack  slanted a glance or two toward the paper, and at the second glance he  gulped.    \"Los Angeles Auto Bandits Trailed\" stared out at him accusingly like a  pointed finger. Underneath, in smaller type, that was black as the  meaning that it bore for him, were the words: \"Sensational  Developments Expected.\"    Jack did not dare look again, lest he betray to the shrewd eyes behind  the glasses a guilty interest in the article. He took his cigarette  from his mouth and moistened his lips, and tried to hide the trembling  of his fingers by flicking off the ash. As soon as he dared he walked  on down the street, and straightway found that he was walking himself  out of town altogether. He turned his head and looked back, saw the  tall man glancing after him, and went on briskly, with some effort  holding himself back from running like a fool. He felt that he had  blundered in coming down this way, where there was nothing but a  blacksmith shop and a few small cottages set in trim lawns. The tall  man would know that he had no business down here, and he would wonder  who he was and what he was after. And once that tall man began to  wonder....    \"Auto Bandits Trailed!\" seemed to Jack to be painted on his back.  That headline must mean him, because he did not believe that any of  the others would think to get out of town before daylight as he had  done. Probably that article had Jack's description in it.    He no longer felt that he had lost himself; instead, he felt trapped  by the very mountains that five minutes ago had seemed so like a  sheltering wall between him and his world. He wanted to get into the  deepest forest that clothed their sides; he wanted to hide in some  remote canyon.    He turned his head again and looked back. A man was coming behind him  down the pathway which served as a pavement. He thought it was the  tall man who had been reading about him in the paper, and again panic  seized him--only now he had but his two feet to carry him away into  safety, instead of his mother's big new car. He glanced at the houses  like a harried animal seeking desperately for some hole to crawl into,  and he saw that the little, square cottage that he had judged to be a  dwelling, was in reality a United States Forest Service headquarters.  He had only the haziest idea of what that meant, but at least it was a"]]]
