(_Aside._)  And put a damp cloth over your eyes for people can see that you have  been crying. [_Exit_ IDA _to the right._ ADELAIDE _quickly goes up to  the_ COLONEL.] What is the matter with Ida and the professor?    COLONEL.    That would be a long story. I shall not spoil my pleasure with it now.  We men are at odds; our views are too opposed.    ADELAIDE.    But were not your views opposed before this, too? And yet you were on  such good terms with Oldendorf!    COLONEL.    They were not so extremely opposed as now.    ADELAIDE.    And which of you has changed his views?    COLONEL.    H'm! Why, he, of course. He is led astray in great part by his evil  companions. There are some men, journalists on his paper, and  especially there is a certain Bolz.    ADELAIDE (_aside_).    What's this I hear?    COLONEL.    But probably you know him yourself. Why, he comes from your  neighborhood.    ADELAIDE.    He is a Rosenau boy.    COLONEL.    I remember. Your father, the good old general, could not endure him.    ADELAIDE.    At least he sometimes said so.    COLONEL.    Since then this Bolz has become queer. His mode of life is said to be  irregular, and I fear his morals are pretty loose. He is Oldendorf's  evil genius.    ADELAIDE.    That would be a pity!--No, I do not believe it!    COLONEL. What do you not believe, Adelaide?    ADELAIDE (_smiling_).    I do not believe in evil geniuses. What has gone wrong between you and  Oldendorf can be set right again. Enemies today, friends  tomorrow--that is the way in politics; but Ida's feelings will not  change so quickly. Colonel, I have brought with me a beautiful design  for a dress. That new dress I mean to wear this winter as bridesmaid.    COLONEL.    No chance of it! You can't catch me that way, girl. I'll carry the war  into the enemy's country. Why do you drive other people to the altar  and let your own whole neighborhood joke you about being the Sleeping  Beauty and the virgin farmer?    ADELAIDE (_laughing_).    Well, so they do.    COLONEL.    The richest heiress in the whole district! Courted by a host of  adorers, yet so firmly intrenched against all sentiment; no one can  comprehend it.    ADELAIDE.    My dear Colonel, if our young gentlemen were as lovable as certain  older ones--but, alas! they are not.    COLONEL.    You shan't escape me. We shall hold you fast in town, until we find  one among our young men whom you will deem worthy to be enrolled under  your command. For whoever be your chosen husband, he will have the  same experience I have had--namely, that, first or last, he will have  to do your bidding.    ADELAIDE (_quickly_).    Will you do my bidding with regard to Ida and the professor? Now I  have you!    COLONEL.    Will you do me the favor of choosing your husband this winter while  you are with us? Yes? Now I have _you_!    ADELAIDE.    It's a bargain! Shake hands! [_Holds out her hand to him._]    COLONEL (_puts his hand in hers, laughing_).    Well, you're outwitted.    [_Exit through centre door._]    ADELAIDE (_alone_).    I don't think I am. What, Mr. Conrad Bolz! Is that your reputation  among people! You live an irregular life? You have loose morals? You  are an evil genius?--    _Enter_ KORB.    KORB (_through the centre door with a package_).    Where shall I put the account-books and the papers, Miss Adelaide?    ADELAIDE.    In my apartment. Tell me, dear Korb, did you find your room here in  order?    KORB.    In the finest order. The servant has given me two wax candles; it is  pure extravagance.    ADELAIDE.    You need not touch a pen for me this whole day. I want you to see the  town and look up your acquaintances. You have acquaintances here, I  suppose?    KORB.    Not very many. It is more than a year since I was last here.    ADELAIDE (_indifferently_).    But are there no people from Rosenau here?    KORB.    Among the soldiers are four from the village. There is John Lutz of  Schimmellutz--    ADELAIDE.    I know. Have you no other acquaintance here from the village?    KORB.    None at all, except him, of course--    ADELAIDE.    Except him? Whom do you mean?    KORB.    Why, our Mr. Conrad.    ADELAIDE.    Oh, to be sure! Are you not going to visit him? I thought you had  always been good friends.    KORB.    Going to visit him? That is the first place I am going to. I have been  looking forward to it during the whole journey. He is a faithful soul  of whom the village has a right to be proud.    ADELAIDE (_warmly_).    Yes, he has a faithful heart.    KORB (_eagerly_).    Ever merry, ever friendly, and so attached to the village! Poor man,  it is a long time since he was there!    ADELAIDE.    Don't speak of it!    KORB.    He will ask me about everything--about the farming--    ADELAIDE (_eagerly_).    And about the horses. The old sorrel he was so fond of riding is still  alive. KORB. And about the shrubs he planted with you.    ADELAIDE.    Especially about the lilac-bush where my arbor now stands. Be sure you  tell him about that.    KORB.    And about the pond. Three hundred and sixty carp!    ADELAIDE.    And sixty gold-tench; don't forget that. And the old carp with the  copper ring about his body, that he put there, came out with the last  haul, and we threw him back again.    KORB.    And how he will ask about you, Miss Adelaide!    ADELAIDE.    Tell him I am well.    KORB.    And how you have carried on the farming since the general died; and  that you take his newspaper which I read aloud to the farm-hands  afterward.    ADELAIDE.    Just that you need not tell him. [_Sighing, aside._] On these lines I  shall learn nothing whatever. [_Pause, gravely._] See here, dear Korb,  I have heard all sorts of things about Mr. Bolz that surprise me. He  is said to live an irregular life.    KORB.    Yes, I imagine he does; he always was a wild colt.    ADELAIDE.    He is said to spend more than his income.    KORB.    Yes, that is quite possible. But I am perfectly sure he spends it  merrily.    ADELAIDE (_aside_).    Small consolation I shall get from him! (_Indifferently._) He has now  a good position, I suppose; won't he soon be looking for a wife?    KORB.    A wife? No, he is not doing that. It is impossible.    ADELAIDE.    Well, I heard something of the kind; at least he is said to be much  interested in a young lady. People are talking of it.    KORB.    Why, that would be--no, I don't believe it. (_Hastily._) But I'll ask  him about it at once.    ADELAIDE.    Well, he would be the last person to tell you. One learns such things  from a man's friends and acquaintances. The village people ought to  know it, I suppose, if a Rosenau man marries.    KORB.    Of course they should. I must get at the truth of that.    ADELAIDE.    You would have to go about it the right way. You know how crafty he  is.    KORB.    Oh, I'll get round him all right. I'll find some way.    ADELAIDE.    Go, dear Korb! [_Exit_ KORB.] Those were sad tidings with which the  Colonel met me. Conrad--immoral, unworthy? It is impossible! A noble  character cannot change to that extent. I do not believe one word of  what they say!    [_EXIT_.]      SCENE II      _Editorial room of the \"Union.\" Doors in the centre and on both sides.

MILLER (_nimbly with a package of letters and newspapers_).    Here is the mail, Mr. Bolz; and here, from the press, is the  proof-sheet of this evening's issue to be corrected.    BOLZ (_at the table on the left quickly opening, looking through, and  marking letters with a pencil_).    I have already corrected the proof, old rascal!    MILLER.    Not quite. Down here is still the \"Miscellaneous\" which Mr. Bellmaus  gave the type-setters.    BOLZ.    Let us have it!    [_Reads in the newspaper._]    \"Washing stolen from the yard\"--\"Triplets  born\"--\"Concert\"--\"Concert\"--\"Meeting of an  Association\"--\"Theatre\"--all in order--\"Newly invented engine\"--\"The  great sea-serpent spied.\"    [_Jumping up._]    What the deuce is this? Is he bringing up the old sea-serpent again?  It ought to be cooked into a jelly for him, and he be made to eat it  cold.    [_Hurries to the door on the right._]    Bellmaus, monster, come out!    _Enter_ BELLMAUS.    BELLMAUS (_from the right, pen in hand_).    What is the matter! Why all this noise?    BOLZ (_solemnly_).    Bellmaus, when we did you the honor of intrusting you with the odds  and ends for this newspaper, we never expected you to bring the  everlasting great sea-serpent writhing through the columns of our  journal!--How could you put in that worn-out old lie?    BELLMAUS.    It just fitted. There were exactly six lines left.    BOLZ.    That is an excuse, but not a good one. Invent your own stories. What  are you a journalist for? Make a little \"Communication,\" an  observation, for instance, on human life in general, or something  about dogs running around loose in the streets; or choose a  bloodcurdling story such as a murder out of politeness, or how a  woodchuck bit seven sleeping children, or something of that kind. So  infinitely much happens, and so infinitely much does not happen, that  an honest newspaper man ought never to be without news.    BELLMAUS.    Give it here, I will change it.

Facts  were proved with unusual clearness and precision, which put it beyond  the bounds of physical possibility that he could have murdered Mary  Ashford. Those facts hinged on the time shown by several different  clocks, compared with the standard time kept at Birmingham. But the  public feeling on the matter was intense. An engraving of the scene of  the alleged murder, with a stimulating letter-press description, was  published at the time, and the general sense undoubtedly was, that the  perpetrator of a very foul murder had escaped his just doom. Hoping to  do away with this impression, a well-known local lawyer bethought  himself of the long-forgotten \"Appeal of Murder,\" trusting that by a  second acquittal Thornton's innocence would be acknowledged by all.  Though the condition of all the parties was but humble, friends soon  came forward with funds and good advice, so that within the year and a  day which the law allowed, proceedings were taken in the name of William  Ashford (Mary's brother, who, as next heir, according to the old law,  had the sole power of pardon in such a case) for an \"Appeal of Murder\"  against Abraham Thornton. What followed is here given in Mr. Toulmin  Smith's own words:--\"I have seen it stated, hot indignation colouring  imagination, that here was a weak stripling nobly aroused to avenge the  death of his sister, by tendering himself to do battle against the tall  strong man who was charged with her murder. The facts, as they stand are  truly striking enough; but this melodramatic spectacle does not formally  true part of them.\" A writ of \"Appeal of Murder\" was soon issued. It  bears the date of 1st October, 1817. Under that writ Thornton was again  arrested by the Sheriff of Warwick. On the first day of Michaelmas Term,  in the same year, William Ashford appeared in the Court of King's Bench  at Westminster, as _appellant_, and Abraham Thornton, brought up on writ  of _habeas corpus_, appeared as _appellee_. The charge of murder was  formally made by the appellant; and time to plead to this charge was  granted to the appellee until Monday, 16th November.--It must have been  a strange and startling scene, on the morning of that Monday, 16th  November, 1817, when Abraham Thornton stood at the bar of the Court of  King's Bench in Westminster Hall; a scene which that ancient Hall had  not witnessed within the memory of any living man, but which must have  then roused the attention of even its drowsiest haunter. \"The appellee  being brought into Court and placed at the bar\" (I am quoting the  original dry technical record of the transaction), \"and the appellant  being also in court, the count [charge] was again read over to him, and  he [Thornton] was called upon to plead. He pleaded as follows;--'Not  Guilty; and I am ready to defend the same by my body.' And thereupon,  taking his glove off, he threw it on the floor of the Court.\" That is to  say, Ashford having \"appealed\" Thornton of the murder, Thornton claimed  the right to maintain his own innocence by \"Trial of Battel;\" and so his  answer to the charge was a \"Wager of Battel.\" And now the din of fight  seemed near, with the Court of King's Bench at Westminster for the  arena, and the grave Judges of that Court for the umpires. But the case  was destined to add but another illustration to what Cicero tells us of  how, oftentimes, arms yield to argument, and the swordsman's looked-for  laurel vanishes before the pleader's tongue. William Ashford, of course,  acting under the advice of those who really promoted the appeal,  declined to accept Thornton's wager of battel. Instead of accepting it,  his counsel disputed the right of Thornton to wage his battel in this  case; alleging, in a very long plea, that there were presumptions of  guilt so strong as to deprive him of that right. Thornton answered this  plea by another, in which all the facts that had been proved on the  trial at Warwick were set forth at great length. And then the case was  very elaborately argued, for three days, by two eminent and able  counsel, one of whom will be well remembered by most readers as the late  Chief-Justice Tindal. Tindal was Thornton's counsel. Of course I cannot  go here into the argument. The result was, that, on 16th April, 1881,  the full Court (Lord Ellenborough, and Justices Bayley, Abbott, and  Holroyd) declared themselves _unanimously_ of opinion that the appellee  (Thornton) was entitled to, wage his battel, no presumptions of guilt  having been shown clear enough or strong enough to deprive him of that  right. Upon this, Ashford, not having accepted the wager of battel, the  \"appeal\" was stayed, and Thornton was discharged. Thus no reversal took  place of the previous acquittal of Thornton by the Jury at Warwick  Assizes. But that acquittal had nothing whatever to do with any \"trial  by battel;\" for I have shown that the \"wager of battel\" arose out of a  proceeding later than and consequent upon that acquittal, and that this  \"wager of battel\" never reached the stage of a \"trial by battel.\"    What became of Thornton is unknown, but he is supposed to have died in  America, where he fled to escape the obloquoy showered upon him by an  unforgiving public. The adage that \"murder will out\" has frequently  proved correct, but in this case it has not, and the charge against  Thornton is reiterated in every account of this celebrated trial that  has been published, though his innocence cannot now be doubted.    ~Ashted,~ now a populous part of the town, takes its name from Dr. Ash,  whose residence was transformed into Ashted Church, the estate being  laid out for building in 1788.    ~Assay Marks.~--These consist of the initials of the maker, the Queen's  head for the duty (17/-on gold, 1/6 on silver, per oz.), a letter  (changed yearly) for date, an anchor for the Birmingham office mark, and  the standard or value mark, which is given in figures, thus:--for gold  of 22-carat fineness (in oz. of 24) a crown and 22; 18-carat, a crown  and 18; 15-carat, 15.625; 12-carat, 12.5; 9-carat, 9.375. The value mark  for silver of 11 oz. 10 dwts. (in lb. of 12 oz.) is the figure of  Britannia; for 11 oz. 2 dwts. a lion passant. The date letter is changed  in July. At present it is k. The lower standards of 15, 12, and 9-carat  gold (which are not liable to duty), were authorised by an Order in  Council, of December 22, 1854, since which date an immense increase has  taken place in the quantity assayed in Birmingham.    ~Assay Office.~--There are seven Assay Offices in the country, the  Birmingham one being established by special Act in 1773, for the  convenience of silversmiths and plateworkers. A few hours per week was  sufficient for the business at that time, and it was conducted at the  King's Head in New Street; afterwards, in 1782, in Bull Lane, in 1800 at  a house in Little Colmore Street, and from 1816 at the old Baptist  Chapel in Little Cannon Street. In 1824 the Act 5, George IV., cap 52,  incorporated the assay of gold, the guardians being 36 in number, from  whom are chosen the wardens. On July 14, 1877, the foundation stone was  laid of the New Assay Office in Newhall Street, and it was opened for  business June 24, 1878.    ~Assizes.~--Birmingham was \"proclaimed\" an assize town January 14, 1859,  but the first assizes were held in July, 1884.    ~Aston.~--Eight hundred years ago, Aston filled a small space in the  Domesday book of history, wherein it is stated that the estate consisted  of eight hides of land, and three miles of wood, worth L5, with 44  residents (one being a priest), and 1,200 acres in cultivation. The  present area of Aston Manor is 943 acres, on which are built about  14,000 houses, having a population of some 60,000 persons, and a  rateable value of L140,000. In the first ten years of the existence of  the Local Board (1869 to 1878) L30,000 was spent on main drainage works,  L10,000 in public improvements, and L53,000 in street improvements.  Aston has now its Public Buildings, Free Library, &c., as well as an  energetic School Board, and, though unsuccessful in its attempt in 1876  to obtain a charter of incorporation, there can be little doubt but that  it will ultimately bloom forth in all the glories of a Mayor, Aldermen,  and Burgesses. Aston parish, which extends in several directions into  the borough of Birmingham, has an area of 13,786 acres.    ~Aston Almshouses~ were built in 1655, according to the provisions made  by Sir Thomas Holte previous to his decease.    ~Aston Church~ was probably built about the year 1170, the nave and part  of chancel being added in 1231, the east end and arch of chancel in  1310, and the tower and spire in 1440. The old building, which contained  an interesting collection of monuments in memory of the Holtes, the  Ardens, the Erdingtons, and other county families, has been lately  enlarged by the extension of the nave and aisles eastward, and widening  the chancel so as to accommodate about 1,200 people, instead of 500. The  whole of the monuments have been replaced in their relative positions.    ~Aston Cross Tavern~ was opened as a licensed house and tea gardens in  1775, the first landlord, Mr. Barron, dying in 1792, his widow keeping  it till her death in 1817. Of late years it has been a favourite resort  of all classes of athletes, though from being so closely built to it has  lost much of the attraction which drew our grandfathers to its shady  arbours when on country pleasure bent. The park wall extended to the  corner of and along the side of Park Lane, opposite the tavern.    ~Aston Hall and Park.~--This building was commenced by Sir Thomas Holte  in April, 1618, and finished in April, 1635, Inigo Jones being  accredited with the design. King Charles I., in his days of trouble,  paid a short visit to the Hall, his host being punished afterwards by  some of Cromwell's soldiers and the"]]]
