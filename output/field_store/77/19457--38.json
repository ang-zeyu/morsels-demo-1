(#5)"],[1,"Beethoven to tell him what  the F minor and the D minor (Op. 31, No. 2) sonatas meant, he received  for an answer only the enigmatical remark: \"Read Shakespeare's  'Tempest.'\" Many a student and commentator has since read the  \"Tempest\" in the hope of finding a clew to the emotional contents  which Beethoven believed to be in the two works, so singularly  associated, only to find himself baffled. It is a fancy, which rests  perhaps too much on outward things, but still one full of suggestion,  that had Beethoven said: \"Hear my C minor Symphony,\" he would have  given a better starting-point to the imagination of those who are  seeking to know what the F minor sonata means. Most obviously it means  music, but it means music that is an expression of one of those  psychological struggles which Beethoven felt called upon more and more  to delineate as he was more and more shut out from the companionship  of the external world. Such struggles are in the truest sense of the  word tempests. The motive, which, according to the story, Beethoven  himself said indicates, in the symphony, the rappings of Fate at the  door of human existence, is common to two works which are also related  in their spiritual contents. Singularly enough, too, in both cases the  struggle which is begun in the first movement and continued in the  third, is interrupted by a period of calm reassuring, soul-fortifying  aspiration, which in the symphony as well as in the sonata takes the  form of a theme with variations. Here, then, the recognition of a  simple rhythmical figure has helped us to an appreciation of the  spiritual unity of the parts of a symphony, and provided a commentary  on the poetical contents of a sonata. But the lesson is not yet  exhausted. Again do we find the rhythm coloring the first movement of  the pianoforte concerto in G major:    [Music illustration]    Symphony, concerto, and sonata, as the sketch-books of the master  show, were in process of creation at the same time.    [Sidenote: _His Seventh Symphony._]    Thus far we have been helped in identifying a melody and studying  relationships by the rhythmical structure of a single motive. The  demonstration might be extended on the same line into Beethoven's  symphony in A major, in which the external sign of the poetical idea  which underlies the whole work is also rhythmic--so markedly so that  Wagner characterized it most happily and truthfully when he said that  it was \"the apotheosis of the dance.\" Here it is the dactyl, [dactyl  symbol], which in one variation, or another, clings to us almost as  persistently as in Hood's \"Bridge of Sighs:\"        \"One more unfortunate        Weary of breath,      Rashly importunate,        Gone to her death.\"    [Sidenote: _Use of a dactylic figure._]    We hear it lightly tripping in the first movement:    [Music illustration] and [Music illustration];    gentle, sedate, tender, measured, through its combination with a  spondee in the second:    [Music illustration];    cheerily, merrily, jocosely happy in the Scherzo:    [Music illustration];    hymn-like in the Trio:    [Music illustration]    and wildly bacchanalian when subjected to trochaic abbreviation in the  Finale:    [Music illustration]    [Sidenote: _Intervallic characteristics._]    Intervallic characteristics may place the badge of relationship upon  melodies as distinctly as rhythmic. There is no more perfect  illustration of this than that afforded by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.  Speaking of the subject of its finale, Sir George Grove says:         \"And note--while listening to the simple tune itself, before       the variations begin--how _very_ simple it is; the plain       diatonic scale, not a single chromatic interval, and out of       fifty-six notes only three not consecutive.\"[A]    [Sidenote: _The melodies in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony._]    Earlier in the same work, while combating a statement by Lenz that the  resemblance between the second subject of the first movement and the  choral melody is a \"thematic reference of the most striking  importance, vindicating the unity of the entire work, and placing the  whole in a perfectly new light,\" Sir George says:         \"It is, however, very remarkable that so many of the       melodies in the Symphony should consist of consecutive       notes, and that in no less than four of them the notes       should run up a portion of the scale and down       again--apparently pointing to a consistent condition of       Beethoven's mind throughout this work.\"    [Sidenote: _Melodic likenesses._]    Like Goethe, Beethoven secreted many a mystery in his masterpiece, but  he did not juggle idly with tones, or select the themes of his  symphonies at hap-hazard; he would be open to the charge, however, if  the resemblances which I have pointed out in the Fifth and Seventh  Symphonies, and those disclosed by the following melodies from his  Ninth, should turn out through some incomprehensible revelation to be  mere coincidences:    From the first movement:    [Music illustration]    From the second:    [Music illustration]    The choral melody:    [Music illustration]    [Sidenote: _Design and Form._]    From a recognition of the beginnings of design, to which  identification of the composer's thematic material and its simpler  relationships will lead, to so much knowledge of Form as will enable  the reader to understand the later chapters in this book, is but a  step.

III    _The Content and Kinds of Music_      [Sidenote: _Metaphysics to be avoided herein._]    Bearing in mind the purpose of this book, I shall not ask the reader  to accompany me far afield in the region of aesthetic philosophy or  musical metaphysics. A short excursion is all that is necessary to  make plain what is meant by such terms as Absolute music, Programme  music, Classical, Romantic, and Chamber music and the like, which not  only confront us continually in discussion, but stand for things which  we must know if we would read programmes understandingly and  appreciate the various phases in which music presents itself to us. It  is interesting and valuable to know why an art-work stirs up  pleasurable feelings within us, and to speculate upon its relations to  the intellect and the emotions; but the circumstance that  philosophers have never agreed, and probably never will agree, on  these points, so far as the art of music is concerned, alone suffices  to remove them from the field of this discussion.    [Sidenote: _Personal equation in judgment._]    Intelligent listening is not conditioned upon such knowledge. Even  when the study is begun, the questions whether or not music has a  content beyond itself, where that content is to be sought, and how  defined, will be decided in each case by the student for himself, on  grounds which may be said to be as much in his nature as they are in  the argument. The attitude of man toward the art is an individual one,  and in some of its aspects defies explanation.    [Sidenote: _A musical fluid._]    The amount and kind of pleasure which music gives him are frequently  as much beyond his understanding and control as they are beyond the  understanding and control of the man who sits beside him. They are  consequences of just that particular combination of material and  spiritual elements, just that blending of muscular, nervous, and  cerebral tissues, which make him what he is, which segregate him as  an individual from the mass of humanity. We speak of persons as  susceptible or insusceptible to music as we speak of good and poor  conductors of electricity; and the analogy implied here is  particularly apt and striking. If we were still using the scientific  terms of a few decades ago I should say that a musical fluid might yet  be discovered and its laws correlated with those of heat, light, and  electricity. Like them, when reduced to its lowest terms, music is a  form of motion, and it should not be difficult on this analogy to  construct a theory which would account for the physical phenomena  which accompany the hearing of music in some persons, such as the  recession of blood from the face, or an equally sudden suffusion of  the same veins, a contraction of the scalp accompanied by chilliness  or a prickling sensation, or that roughness of the skin called  goose-flesh, \"flesh moved by an idea, flesh horripilated by a  thought.\"    [Sidenote: _Origin of musical elements._]    [Sidenote: _Feelings and counterpoint._]    It has been denied that feelings are the content of music, or that it  is the mission of music to give expression to feelings; but the  scientific fact remains that the fundamental elements of vocal  music--pitch, quality, and dynamic intensity--are the results of  feelings working upon the vocal organs; and even if Mr. Herbert  Spencer's theory be rejected, it is too late now to deny that music is  conceived by its creators as a language of the emotions and so applied  by them. The German philosopher Herbarth sought to reduce the question  to an absurdity by expressing surprise that musicians should still  believe that feelings could be \"the proximate cause of the rules of  simple and double counterpoint;\" but Dr. Stainer found a sufficient  answer by accepting the proposition as put, and directing attention to  the fact that the feelings of men having first decided what was  pleasurable in polyphony, and the rules of counterpoint having  afterward been drawn from specimens of pleasurable polyphony, it was  entirely correct to say that feelings are the proximate cause of the  laws of counterpoint.    [Sidenote: _How composers hear music._]    It is because so many of us have been taught by poets and romancers to  think that there is a picture of some kind, or a story in every piece  of music, and find ourselves unable to agree upon the picture or the  story in any given case, that confusion is so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17478"],[0,"Great Pictures, As Seen and Described (#5)"],[1,"at seeing  her Queen fainting, and does not know what she ought to do; while  lastly, the Queen's dog, another of the little fringy paws, is wholly  unabashed by Solomon's presence, or anybody else's; and stands with his  forelegs well apart, right in front of his mistress, thinking everybody  has lost their wits; and barking violently at one of the attendants, who  has set down a golden vase disrespectfully near him.        _Modern Painters_ (London, 1860).          THE LAST JUDGEMENT    (_MICHAEL ANGELO_)    ALEXANDRE DUMAS      While Michael Angelo worked upon his _Moses_, Clement VII., following  the example of Julius II., would not leave him alone for a moment. It  was a trick of all these Popes to exact from the poor artist something  different to what he was doing at the time. To obtain some respite, he  was forced to promise the Pope that he would occupy himself at the same  time with the cartoon of _The Last Judgment_. But Clement VII. was not a  man to be put off with words; he supervised the work in person, and  Buonarroti was obliged to pass continually from the chisel to the pencil  and from the pen to the mallet. _The Last Judgment!_ _Moses!_ these are  two works of little importance and easy to do off-hand! And yet he had  to. His Holiness would not listen to reason.    One day it was announced to Michael Angelo that he would not receive his  accustomed visit: Clement VII. was dead. The artist breathed freely just  during the Conclave.    The new Pope, Paul III., had nothing more pressing to do than to present  himself in Buonarroti's studio, followed pompously by ten cardinals. The  newly-elected Pope was easily recognized there!    [Illustration: THE LAST JUDGMENT.          _Michael Angelo_.]    \"Ah!\" said the Holy Father, in a tone of firm decision, \"I hope that  henceforth the whole of your time will belong to me, Maestro  Buonarroti.\"    \"May your Holiness deign to excuse me,\" replied Michael Angelo, \"but I  have just signed an engagement with the Duke of Urbino, which forces me  to finish the tomb of Pope Julius.\"    \"What!\" exclaimed Paul III.: \"for thirty years I have had a certain wish  and now that I am Pope I cannot realize it!\"    \"But the contract, Holy Father, the contract!\"    \"Where is this contract? I will tear it up.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed in his turn the Cardinal of Mantua, who was one of the  suite, \"your Holiness should see the _Moses_ which Maestro Michael  Angelo has just finished: that statue alone would more than suffice to  honour the memory of Julius.\"    \"Cursed flatterer!\" muttered Michael Angelo in a low voice.    \"Come, come, I will take charge of this matter myself,\" said the Pope.  \"You shall only make three statues with your own hand: the rest shall be  given to other sculptors, and I will answer for the Duke of Urbino's  consent. And now, Maestro, to the Sistine Chapel. A great empty wall is  waiting for you there.\"    What could Michael Angelo reply to such an emphatic wish expressed so  distinctly? He finished in his best style his two statues of _Active  Life_ and _Contemplative Life_--Dante's symbolical Rachel and Leah--and  not wishing to profit by this new arrangement to which he was forced to  submit, he added fifteen hundred and twenty-four ducats to the four  thousand he had received, to pay with his own gains for the works  confided to the other artists.    Having thus terminated this unfortunate affair, which had caused him so  much worry and fatigue, Michael Angelo was at last enabled to occupy  himself exclusively with the execution of his _Last Judgment_, to which  he devoted no less than eight to nine years.    This immense and unique picture, in which the human figure is  represented in all possible attitudes, where every sentiment, every  passion, every reflection of thought, and every aspiration of the soul  are rendered with inimitable perfection, has never been equalled and  never will be equalled in the domain of Art.    This time the genius of Michael Angelo simply attacked the infinite. The  subject of this vast composition, the manner in which it is conceived  and executed, the admirable variety and the learned disposition of the  groups, the inconceivable boldness and firmness of the outlines, the  contrast of light and shade, the difficulties, I might almost say the  impossibilities vanquished, as if it were all mere play, and with a  happiness that savours of prodigy, the unity of the whole and the  perfection of the details, make _The Last Judgment_ the most complete  and the greatest picture in existence. It is broad and magnificent in  effect, and yet each part of this prodigious painting gains infinitely  when seen and studied quite near; and we do not know of any  easel-picture worked upon with such patience and finished with such  devotion.    The painter could only choose one scene, several isolated groups, in  this appalling drama which will be enacted on the last day in the Valley  of Jehoshaphat, where all the generations of man shall be gathered  together. And yet, admire the omnipotence of genius! With nothing but a  single episode in a restricted space, and solely by the expression of  the human body, the artist has succeeded in striking you with  astonishment and terror, and in making you really a spectator of the  supreme catastrophe.    At the base of the picture, very nearly in the centre, you perceive the  boat of the _Inferno_, a fantastic reminiscence borrowed from Pagan  tradition, in accordance with which first the poet and then the painter  were pleased to clothe an accursed being with the form and occupation of  Charon.    \"Charon with the eyes of burning embers gathering together with a  gesture all these souls, and striking with his oar those who  hesitate.\"[1]    It is impossible to form an idea of the incredible science displayed by  Michael Angelo in the varied contortions of the damned, heaped one upon  the other in the fatal bark. All the violent contractions, all the  visible tortures, all the frightful shrinkings that suffering, despair,  and rage can produce upon human muscles are rendered in this group with  a realism that would make the most callous shudder. To the left of this  bark you see the gaping mouth of a cavern; this is the entrance to  Purgatory, where several demons are in despair because they have no more  souls to torment.    This first group, which very naturally attracts the spectator's  attention, is that of the dead whom the piercing sound of the eternal  trumpet has awakened in their tombs. Some of them shake off their  shrouds, others with great difficulty open their eyelids made heavy by  their long sleep. Towards the angle of the picture there is a monk who  is pointing out the Divine Judge with his left hand; this monk is the  portrait of Michael Angelo.    The second group is formed of the resuscitated ones who ascend of  themselves to the Judgment. These figures, many of which are sublime in  expression, rise more or less lightly into space, according to the  burden of their sins, of which they must render account.    The third group, also ascending to the right of Christ, is that of the  Blessed. Among all these saints, some of whom show the instrument of  their execution, others the marks of their martyrdom, there is one head  especially remarkable for beauty and tenderness: it is that of a mother  who is protecting her daughter, turning her eyes, filled with faith and  hope, towards the Christ.    Above the host of saints, you see a fourth group of angelic spirits,  some bearing the Cross, others the Crown of Thorns,--instruments and  emblems of the Saviour's Passion.    The fifth group, parallel to the fourth which we have just pointed out,  is composed of angels; such, at least, they seem to be by the splendour  of their youth and the aerial lightness of their movements; and these  also bear, as if in triumph, other emblems of the divine expiation--the  column, the ladder, and the sponge.    Above these angels, on the same plane as the saints and to the left of  Christ, is the choir of the just; the patriarchs, the prophets, the  apostles, the martyrs, and the holy personages form this sixth group.    The seventh is the most horrible of all and the one in which the art of  Michael Angelo has displayed itself in all its terrific grandeur: it is  composed of the rejected ones, overwhelmed by the decree and led away to  punishment by the rebel angels. The very coldest spectator could not  remain unmoved by this spectacle. You believe yourself in hell; you hear  the cries of anguish and the gnashing of the teeth of the wretched, who,  according to the terrible Dantesque expression, vainly desire a second  death.    The eighth, ninth, and tenth groups, occupying the base of the  composition, are composed, as we have already said, of the bark of  Charon, the grotto of Purgatory, and the Angels of Judgment, eight in  number, blowing their brazen trumpets with all their might to convoke  the dead from the four quarters of the earth.    Finally, in the eleventh group, in the centre, very near the upper part  of the picture, between the two companies of the blessed, and seated  upon the clouds, the sovereign Judge with a terrible action hurls his  malediction upon the condemned: _\"Ite maledicti in ignem aeternum.\"_ The  Virgin turns away her head and trembles. On Christ's right is Adam, and  on his left, St. Peter. They have exactly the same positions assigned to  them by Dante in his _Paradiso_.    This immense work was exhibited to the public on Christmas Day, 1541. It  had cost eight years of work. Michael Angelo was then sixty-seven years  old.    Several anecdotes relating to this great picture have come down to us.    It is related that the Pope, scandalized at the nudity of certain  figures, a nudity which Daniele da Volterra was afterwards charged to  clothe, sent word to Michael Angelo that he must cover them.    Michael Angelo replied with his usual brusqueness:    \"Tell"]]]
