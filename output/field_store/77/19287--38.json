And with this stern, sad lesson  treasured up in his heart, Garrison graduated from another room in the  school-house of experience. All the discoveries of the young journalist  were not of this grim character. He made another discovery altogether  different, a real gem of its kind. The drag-net of a newspaper catches  all sorts of poets and poetry, good, bad, and indifferent--oftener the  bad and indifferent, rarely the good. The drag-net of the _Free Press_  was no exception to this rule; but, one day, it fetched up from the  depths of the hard commonplaces of our New England town life a genuine  pearl. We will let Mr. Garrison tell the story in his own way:          \"Going up-stairs to my office, one day, I observed a letter      lying near the door, to my address; which, on opening, I found      to contain an original piece of poetry for my paper, the _Free      Press_. The ink was very pale, the handwriting very small; and,      having at that time a horror of newspaper original poetry--which      has rather increased than diminished with the lapse of time--my      first impulse was to tear it in pieces, without reading it; the      chances of rejection, after its perusal, being as ninety-nine to      one; ... but summoning resolution to read it, I was equally      surprised and gratified to find it above mediocrity, and so gave      it a place in my journal.... As I was anxious to find out the      writer, my post-rider, one day, divulged the secret, stating      that he had dropped the letter in the manner described, and that      it was written by a Quaker lad, named Whittier, who was daily at      work on the shoemaker's bench, with hammer and lapstone, at East      Haverhill. Jumping into a vehicle, I lost no time in driving to      see the youthful rustic bard, who came into the room with      shrinking diffidence, almost unable to speak, and blushing like      a maiden. Giving him some words of encouragement, I addressed      myself more particularly to his parents, and urged them with      great earnestness to grant him every possible facility for the      development of his remarkable genius.\"      Garrison had not only found a true poet, but a true friend as well, in  the Quaker lad, John Greenleaf Whittier. The friendship which sprang up  between the two was to last during the lifetime of the former. Neither  of them in those days of small things could have possibly by any flight  of the imagination foreseen how their two lives, moving in parallel  lines, would run deep their shining furrows through one of the greatest  chapters of human history. But I am anticipating, and that is a vice of  which no good storyteller ought to be guilty. So, then, let me  incontinently return from this excursion and pursue the even tenor of my  tale.    Garrison had stepped down from his elevated position as the publisher  and editor of the _Free Press_. He was without work, and, being  penniless, it behooved him to find some means of support. With the  instinct of the bright New England boy, he determined to seek his  fortunes in Boston. If his honesty and independence put him at a  disadvantage, as publisher and editor, in the struggle for existence, he  had still his trade as a compositor to fall back upon As a journeyman  printer he would earn his bread, and preserve the integrity of an  upright spirit. And so without a murmur, and with cheerfulness and  persistency, he hunted for weeks on the streets of Boston for a chance  to set types. This hunting for a job in a strange city was discouraging  enough. Twice before had he visited the place, which was to be his  future home. Once when on his way to Baltimore to see his mother, and  once afterward when on a sort of pleasure tramp with three companions.  But the slight knowledge which he was able to obtain of the town and its  inhabitants under these circumstances did not now help him, when from  office to office he went in quest of something to do. After many  failures and renewed searchings, he found what he was after, an  opportunity to practice his trade. Business was dull, which kept our  journeyman printer on the wing; first at one and then at another  printing office we find him setting types for a living during the year  1827. The winning of bread was no easy matter; but he was not ashamed to  work, neither was he afraid of hard work. During this year, he found  time to take a hand in a little practical politics. There was in July,  1827, a caucus of the Federal party to nominate a successor to Daniel  Webster in the House of Representatives. Young Garrison attended this  caucus, and made havoc of its cut and dried programme, by moving the  nomination of Harrison Gray Otis, instead of the candidate, a Mr.  Benjamin Gorham, agreed upon by the leaders. Harrison Gray Otis was one  of Garrison's early and particular idols. He was, perhaps, the one  Massachusetts politician whom the young Federalist had placed on a  pedestal. And so on this occasion he went into the caucus with a written  speech in his hat, eulogistic of his favorite. He had meant to have the  speech at his tongue's end, and to get it off as if on the spur of the  moment. But the speech stayed where it was put, in the speaker's hat,  and failed to materialize where and when it was wanted on the speaker's  tongue. As the mountain would not go to Mahomet, Mahomet like a sensible  prophet went to the mountain. Our orator in imitation of this  illustrious example, bowed to the inevitable and went to his mountain.  Pulling his extempore remarks out of his hat, he delivered himself of  them to such effect as to create quite an Otis sentiment in the meeting.  This performance was, of course, a shocking offence in the eyes of  those, whose plans it had disturbed. With one particular old fogy he got  into something of a newspaper controversy in consequence. The  \"consummate assurance\" of one so young fairly knocked the breath out of  this Mr. Eminent Respectability; it was absolutely revolting to all his  \"ideas of propriety, to see a stranger, a man who never paid a tax in  our city, and perhaps no where else, to possess the impudence to take  the lead and nominate a candidate for the electors of Boston!\" The  \"young gentleman of six months standing,\" was not a whit abashed or awed  by the commotion which he had produced. That was simply a case of cause  and effect. But he seemed in turn astonished at his opponent's evident  ignorance of William Lloyd Garrison. \"It is true,\" he replied, with the  proud dignity of conscious power, \"it is true that my acquaintance in  this city is limited. I have sought none. Let me assure him, however,  that if my life be spared, my name shall one day be known to the  world--at least to such extent that common inquiry shall be unnecessary.  This, I know will be deemed excessive vanity--but time shall prove it  prophetic.\" To the charge of youth he makes this stinging rejoinder,  which evinces the progress he was making in the tournament of language:  \"The little, paltry sneers at my youth by your correspondent have long  since become pointless. It is the privileged abuse of old age--the  hackneyed allegation of a thousand centuries--the damning _crime_ to  which all men have been subjected. I leave it to metaphysicians to  determine the precise moment when wisdom and experience leap into  existence, when, for the first time, the mind distinguishes truth from  error, selfishness from patriotism, and passion from reason. It is  sufficient for me that I am understood.\" This was Garrison's first  experience with \"gentlemen of property and standing\" in Boston. It was  not his last, as future chapters will abundantly show.            CHAPTER II.        THE MAN HEARS A VOICE: SAMUEL, SAMUEL!      There is a moment in the life of every serious soul, when things, which  were before unseen and unheard in the world around him become visible  and audible. This startling moment comes to some sooner, to others  later, but to all, who are not totally given up to the service of self,  at sometime surely. From that moment a change passes over such an one,  for more and more he hears mysterious voices, and clearer and more clear  he sees apparitional forms floating up from the depths above which he  kneels. Whence come they, what mean they? He leans over the abyss, and  lo! the sounds to which he hearkens are the voices of human weeping and  the forms at which he gazes are the apparitions of human woe; they  beckon to him, and the voices beseech him in multitudinous accent and  heart-break: \"Come over, come down, oh! friend and brother, and help  us.\" Then he straightway puts away the things and the thoughts of the  past and girding himself with the things, and the thoughts of the divine  OUGHT and the almighty MUST, he goes over and down to the rescue.    Such an epochal first moment came to William Lloyd Garrison in the  streets of Boston. Amid the hard struggle for bread he heard the abysmal  voices, saw the gaunt forms of misery. He was a constant witness of the  ravages of the demon of drink--saw how strong men succumbed, and weak  ones turned to brutes in its clutch. And were they not his brothers, the  strong men and the weak ones alike? And how could he, their keeper, see  them desperately beset and not fly to their help? Ah! he could not and  did not walk by on the other side, but, stripling though he was, rushed  to do battle with the giant vice, which was slaying the souls and the  bodies of his fellow citizens. Rum during the three first decades of the  present century was, like death, no respecter of persons, entering with  equal freedom the homes of the rich, and the hovels of the poor. It was  in universal demand by all classes and conditions of men.

This is the answer to  those who continue to maintain that the \"origin of species\" is not yet  discovered; that there are still doubts and difficulties; that there are  divergencies of structure so great that we cannot understand how they  had their beginning. We may admit all this, just as we may admit that  there are enormous difficulties in the way of a complete comprehension  of the origin and nature of all the parts of the solar system and of the  stellar universe. But we claim for Darwin that he is the Newton of  natural history, and that, just so surely as that the discovery and  demonstration by Newton of the law of gravitation established order in  place of chaos and laid a sure foundation for all future study of the  starry heavens, so surely has Darwin, by his discovery of the law of  natural selection and his demonstration of the great principle of the  preservation of useful variations in the struggle for life, not only  thrown a flood of light on the process of development of the whole  organic world, but also established a firm foundation for all future  study of nature.    In order to show the view Darwin took of his own work, and what it was  that he alone claimed to have done, the concluding passage of the  introduction to the _Origin of_ _Species_ should be carefully  considered. It is as follows: \"Although much remains obscure, and will  long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate  and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which  most naturalists until recently entertained and which I formerly  entertained--namely, that each species has been independently  created--is erroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not  immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera  are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in  the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the  descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am convinced that Natural  Selection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of  modification.\"    It should be especially noted that all which is here claimed is now  almost universally admitted, while the criticisms of Darwin's works  refer almost exclusively to those numerous questions which, as he  himself says, \"will long remain obscure.\"      _The Darwinian Theory_.    As it will be necessary, in the following chapters, to set forth a  considerable body of facts in almost every department of natural  history, in order to establish the fundamental propositions on which the  theory of natural selection rests, I propose to give a preliminary  statement of what the theory really is, in order that the reader may  better appreciate the necessity for discussing so many details, and may  thus feel a more enlightened interest in them. Many of the facts to be  adduced are so novel and so curious that they are sure to be appreciated  by every one who takes an interest in nature, but unless the need of  them is clearly seen it may be thought that time is being wasted on mere  curious details and strange facts which have little bearing on the  question at issue.    The theory of natural selection rests on two main classes of facts which  apply to all organised beings without exception, and which thus take  rank as fundamental principles or laws. The first is, the power of rapid  multiplication in a geometrical progression; the second, that the  offspring always vary slightly from the parents, though generally very  closely resembling them. From the first fact or law there follows,  necessarily, a constant struggle for existence; because, while the  offspring always exceed the parents in number, generally to an enormous  extent, yet the total number of living organisms in the world does not,  and cannot, increase year by year. Consequently every year, on the  average, as many die as are born, plants as well as animals; and the  majority die premature deaths. They kill each other in a thousand  different ways; they starve each other by some consuming the food that  others want; they are destroyed largely by the powers of nature--by cold  and heat, by rain and storm, by flood and fire. There is thus a  perpetual struggle among them which shall live and which shall die; and  this struggle is tremendously severe, because so few can possibly remain  alive--one in five, one in ten, often only one in a hundred or even one  in a thousand.    Then comes the question, Why do some live rather than others? If all the  individuals of each species were exactly alike in every respect, we  could only say it is a matter of chance. But they are not alike. We find  that they vary in many different ways. Some are stronger, some swifter,  some hardier in constitution, some more cunning. An obscure colour may  render concealment more easy for some, keener sight may enable others to  discover prey or escape from an enemy better than their fellows. Among  plants the smallest differences may be useful or the reverse. The  earliest and strongest shoots may escape the slug; their greater vigour  may enable them to flower and seed earlier in a wet autumn; plants best  armed with spines or hairs may escape being devoured; those whose  flowers are most conspicuous may be soonest fertilised by insects. We  cannot doubt that, on the whole, any beneficial variations will give the  possessors of it a greater probability of living through the tremendous  ordeal they have to undergo. There may be something left to chance, but  on the whole _the fittest will survive_.    Then we have another important fact to consider, the principle of  heredity or transmission of variations. If we grow plants from seed or  breed any kind of animals year after year, consuming or giving away all  the increase we do not wish to keep just as they come to hand, our  plants or animals will continue much the same; but if every year we  carefully save the best seed to sow and the finest or brightest  coloured animals to breed from, we shall soon find that an improvement  will take place, and that the average quality of our stock will be  raised. This is the way in which all our fine garden fruits and  vegetables and flowers have been produced, as well as all our splendid  breeds of domestic animals; and they have thus become in many cases so  different from the wild races from which they originally sprang as to be  hardly recognisable as the same. It is therefore proved that if any  particular kind of variation is preserved and bred from, the variation  itself goes on increasing in amount to an enormous extent; and the  bearing of this on the question of the origin of species is most  important. For if in each generation of a given animal or plant the  fittest survive to continue the breed, then whatever may be the special  peculiarity that causes \"fitness\" in the particular case, that  peculiarity will go on increasing and strengthening _so long as it is  useful to the species_. But the moment it has reached its maximum of  usefulness, and some other quality or modification would help in the  struggle, then the individuals which vary in the new direction will  survive; and thus a species may be gradually modified, first in one  direction, then in another, till it differs from the original parent  form as much as the greyhound differs from any wild dog or the  cauliflower from any wild plant. But animals or plants which thus differ  in a state of nature are always classed as distinct species, and thus we  see how, by the continuous survival of the fittest or the preservation  of favoured races in the struggle for life, new species may be  originated.    This self-acting process which, by means of a few easily demonstrated  groups of facts, brings about change in the organic world, and keeps  each species in harmony with the conditions of its existence, will  appear to some persons so clear and simple as to need no further  demonstration. But to the great majority of naturalists and men of  science endless difficulties and objections arise, owing to the  wonderful variety of animal and vegetable forms, and the intricate  relations of the different species and groups of species with each  other; and it was to answer as many of these objections as possible, and  to show that the more we know of nature the more we find it to  harmonise with the development hypothesis, that Darwin devoted the whole  of his life to collecting facts and making experiments, the record of a  portion of which he has given us in a series of twelve masterly volumes.      _Proposed Mode of Treatment of the Subject_.    It is evidently of the most vital importance to any theory that its  foundations should be absolutely secure. It is therefore necessary to  show, by a wide and comprehensive array of facts, that animals and  plants _do_ perpetually vary in the manner and to the amount requisite;  and that this takes place in wild animals as well as in those which are  domesticated. It is necessary also to prove that all organisms _do_ tend  to increase at the great rate alleged, and that this increase actually  occurs, under favourable conditions. We have to prove, further, that  variations of all kinds can be increased and accumulated by selection;  and that the struggle for existence to the extent here indicated  actually occurs in nature, and leads to the continued preservation of  favourable variations.    These matters will be discussed in the four succeeding chapters, though  in a somewhat different order--the struggle for existence and the power  of rapid multiplication, which is its cause, occupying the first place,  as comprising those facts which are the most fundamental and those which  can be perfectly explained without any reference to the less generally  understood"]]]
