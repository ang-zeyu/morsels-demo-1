The  next morning he resumed his journey, stopping only long enough to  make a kill and satisfy his hunger. The other beasts of the wild  eat and lie up; but Tarzan never let his belly interfere with his  plans. In this lay one of the greatest differences between the ape-man  and his fellows of the jungles and forests. The firing ahead rose  and fell during the day. He had noticed that it was highest at  dawn and immediately after dusk and that during the night it almost  ceased. In the middle of the afternoon of the second day he came  upon troops moving up toward the front. They appeared to be raiding  parties, for they drove goats and cows along with them and there  were native porters laden with grain and other foodstuffs. He saw  that these natives were all secured by neck chains and he also saw  that the troops were composed of native soldiers in German uniforms.  The officers were white men. No one saw Tarzan, yet he was here and  there about and among them for two hours. He inspected the insignia  upon their uniforms and saw that they were not the same as that  which he had taken from one of the dead soldiers at the bungalow  and then he passed on ahead of them, unseen in the dense bush. He  had come upon Germans and had not killed them; but it was because  the killing of Germans at large was not yet the prime motive of  his existence--now it was to discover the individual who slew his  mate.    After he had accounted for him he would take up the little matter  of slaying ALL Germans who crossed his path, and he meant that many  should cross it, for he would hunt them precisely as professional  hunters hunt the man-eaters.    As he neared the front lines the troops became more numerous. There  were motor trucks and ox teams and all the impedimenta of a small  army and always there were wounded men walking or being carried  toward the rear. He had crossed the railroad some distance back and  judged that the wounded were being taken to it for transportation  to a base hospital and possibly as far away as Tanga on the coast.    It was dusk when he reached a large camp hidden in the foothills of  the Pare Mountains. As he was approaching from the rear he found  it but lightly guarded and what sentinels there were, were not  upon the alert, and so it was an easy thing for him to enter after  darkness had fallen and prowl about listening at the backs of tents,  searching for some clew to the slayer of his mate.    As he paused at the side of a tent before which sat a number of  native soldiers he caught a few words spoken in native dialect that  riveted his attention instantly: \"The Waziri fought like devils;  but we are greater fighters and we killed them all.  When we were  through the captain came and killed the woman. He stayed outside  and yelled in a very loud voice until all the men were killed.  Underlieutenant von Goss is braver--he came in and stood beside the  door shouting at us, also in a very loud voice, and bade us nail  one of the Waziri who was wounded to the wall, and then he laughed  loudly because the man suffered. We all laughed. It was very funny.\"    Like a beast of prey, grim and terrible, Tarzan crouched in the  shadows beside the tent. What thoughts passed through that savage  mind? Who may say? No outward sign of passion was revealed by the  expression of the handsome face; the cold, gray eyes denoted only  intense watchfulness. Presently the soldier Tarzan had heard first  rose and with a parting word turned away. He passed within ten  feet of the ape-man and continued on toward the rear of the camp.  Tarzan followed and in the shadows of a clump of bushes overtook  his quarry. There was no sound as the man beast sprang upon the  back of his prey and bore it to the ground for steel fingers closed  simultaneously upon the soldier's throat, effectually stifling  any outcry. By the neck Tarzan dragged his victim well into the  concealment of the bushes.    \"Make no sound,\" he cautioned in the man's own tribal dialect as  he released his hold upon the other's throat.    The fellow gasped for breath, rolling frightened eyes upward to  see what manner of creature it might be in whose power he was. In  the darkness he saw only a naked brown body bending above him; but  he still remembered the terrific strength of the mighty muscles  that had closed upon his wind and dragged him into the bushes as  though he had been but a little child. If any thought of resistance  had crossed his mind he must have discarded it at once, as he made  no move to escape.    \"What is the name of the officer who killed the woman at the bungalow  where you fought with the Waziri?\" asked Tarzan.    \"Hauptmann Schneider,\" replied the black when he could again command  his voice.    \"Where is he?\" demanded the ape-man.    \"He is here. It may be that he is at headquarters. Many of the  officers go there in the evening to receive orders.\"    \"Lead me there,\" commanded Tarzan, \"and if I am discovered I will  kill you immediately. Get up!\"    The black rose and led the way by a roundabout route back through  the camp. Several times they were forced to hide while soldiers  passed; but at last they reached a great pile of baled hay from about  the corner of which the black pointed out a two-story building in  the distance.    \"Headquarters,\" he said. \"You can go no farther unseen.  There are  many soldiers about.\"    Tarzan realized that he could not proceed farther in company with  the black. He turned and looked at the fellow for a moment as though  pondering what disposition to make of him.    \"You helped to crucify Wasimbu, the Waziri,\" he accused in a low  yet none the less terrible tone.    The black trembled, his knees giving beneath him. \"He ordered us  to do it,\" he plead.    \"Who ordered it done?\" demanded Tarzan.    \"Underlieutenant von Goss,\" replied the soldier. \"He, too, is here.\"    \"I shall find him,\" returned Tarzan, grimly. \"You helped to crucify  Wasimbu, the Waziri, and, while he suffered, you laughed.\"    The fellow reeled. It was as though in the accusation he read also  his death sentence. With no other word Tarzan seized the man again  by the neck. As before there was no outcry. The giant muscles tensed.  The arms swung quickly upward and with them the body of the black  soldier who had helped to crucify Wasimbu, the Waziri, described a  circle in the air--once, twice, three times, and then it was flung  aside and the ape-man turned in the direction of General Kraut's  headquarters.    A single sentinel in the rear of the building barred the way.  Tarzan crawled, belly to the ground, toward him, taking advantage  of cover as only the jungle-bred beast of prey can do. When the  sentinel's eyes were toward him, Tarzan hugged the ground, motionless  as stone; when they were turned away, he moved swiftly forward.  Presently he was within charging distance. He waited until the man  had turned his back once more and then he rose and sped noiselessly  down upon him.  Again there was no sound as he carried the dead  body with him toward the building.    The lower floor was lighted, the upper dark. Through the windows  Tarzan saw a large front room and a smaller room in rear of it.  In the former were many officers. Some moved about talking to one  another, others sat at field tables writing.  The windows were open  and Tarzan could hear much of the conversation; but nothing that  interested him. It was mostly about the German successes in Africa  and conjectures as to when the German army in Europe would reach  Paris. Some said the Kaiser was doubtlessly already there, and  there was a great deal of damning Belgium.    In the smaller back room a large, red-faced man sat behind a table.  Some other officers were also sitting a little in rear of him,  while two stood at attention before the general, who was questioning  them. As he talked, the general toyed with an oil lamp that stood  upon the table before him. Presently there came a knock upon the  door and an aide entered the room. He saluted and reported: \"Fraulein  Kircher has arrived, sir.\"    \"Bid her enter,\" commanded the general, and then nodded to the two  officers before him in sign of dismissal.    The Fraulein, entering, passed them at the door. The officers in  the little room rose and saluted, the Fraulein acknowledging the  courtesy with a bow and a slight smile.  She was a very pretty  girl. Even the rough, soiled riding habit and the caked dust upon  her face could not conceal the fact, and she was young. She could  not have been over nineteen.    She advanced to the table behind which the general stood and, taking  a folded paper from an inside pocket of her coat, handed it to him.    \"Be seated, Fraulein,\" he said, and another officer brought her  a chair. No one spoke while the general read the contents of the  paper.    Tarzan appraised the various people in the room. He wondered if one  might not be Hauptmann Schneider, for two of them were captains.  The girl he judged to be of the intelligence department--a spy.  Her beauty held no appeal for him--without a glimmer of compunction  he could have wrung that fair, young neck. She was German and that  was enough; but he had other and more important work before him.  He wanted Hauptmann Schneider.    Finally the general looked up from the paper.    \"Good,\" he said to the girl, and then to one of his aides, \"Send  for Major Schneider.\"    Major Schneider! Tarzan felt the short hairs at the back of his  neck rise. Already they had promoted the beast who had murdered  his mate--doubtless they had promoted him for that very crime.    The aide left the room and the others fell into a general conversation  from which it became apparent to Tarzan that the German East African  forces greatly outnumbered the British and that the latter were  suffering heavily. The ape-man stood so concealed in a clump of  bushes that he could watch the interior of the room"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14012"],[0,"Ice-Caves of France and Switzerland (#5)"],[1,"to one of the neighbouring stations,  between Geneva and Lausanne, and thence pass up the slope of the Jura by  the road which leads through Gimel. For the train, the Allaman station  would be the most convenient, as an omnibus runs from Allaman to  Aubonne, where the poste for Gimel may be caught. But from Arzier there  is a short cut of less than two hours along the side of the hills,  leaving that village by a deep gorge not unfitly named _L'Enfer_, and a  dark wood which retains an odour of more savage bygone times in its name  of the 'Bear's Wood,' as containing a cavern where an old bear was  detected in the act of attempting to winter.[12]    The village of S. Georges has very respectable accommodation for a  single traveller, _au Cavalier_. The common day-room will be found  untenable by most Englishmen, however largely they may delight in  rough quarters; but there is a double-bedded room at the end of a  bricked passage up-stairs, which serves well for bedroom and  sitting-room in one. The chief drawback in this arrangement is, that  the landlady inexorably removes all washing apparatus during the day,  holding that a pitcher and basin are unseemly ornaments for a  sitting-room. The deal table, of course, serves both for dressing and  for feeding purposes, but it is fortunately so long that an end can be  devoted to each; and on the whole it is possible to become  considerably attached to the room, with its three airy windows, and  the cool unceasing hum of a babbling fountain in the village-street  below. The Auberge is a large building, with a clock-tower of  considerable height, containing the clock of the commune: as soon as  the candle is put out at night, it becomes painfully evident that a  rectangular projection in one corner of the room is in connection with  this tower, and in fact forms a part of the abode of the pendulum,  which plods on with audible vigour, growing more and more audible as  the hours pass on, and making a stealthy pervading noise, as if a  couple of lazy ghosts were threshing phantom wheat. The clocks of  Vaud, too, are in the habit of striking the hour twice, with a short  interval; so that if anyone is not sure what the clock meant the first  time, he has a second chance of counting the strokes. This is no doubt  an admirable plan under ordinary circumstances, but it does certainly  try the patience of a sleepless dyspeptic after a surfeit of  cafe-au-lait and honey; and when he has counted carefully the first  time, and is bristling with the consciousness that it is only  midnight, it is aggravating in the extreme to have the long slow story  told a second time within a few feet of his head.    The Cavalier had retained a guide overnight, Henri Renaud by name, and  he appeared punctually at eight o'clock in the morning, got up in the  short-tail coat of the country, and a large green umbrella with mighty  ribs of whalebone. The weather was extremely unpleasant, a cold pitiless  rain rendering all attempts at protection unavailing; but, fortunately,  the glaciere is only an hour and a quarter from the village. The path is  tolerably steep, leading across the _petit Pre de Rolle_, and through  woods of beech and fir, till the summit of one of the minor ridges of  the Jura is reached, whence a short descent leads to the mouth of the  glaciere, something more than 4,000 feet above the sea. The ground here  slopes down towards the north; and on the slope, among fir-trees, an  irregular circular basin is seen, some seven or eight yards across,[13]  and perhaps two yards deep, at the bottom of which are two holes. One of  these holes is open, and as the guide and I--for my sisters remained at  Arzier--stood on the neck of ground between the holes, we could see the  snow lying at the bottom of the cave; the other is covered with trunks  of trees, laid over the mouth to prevent the rays of the sun from  striking down on to the ice. This protection has become necessary in  consequence of an incautious felling of wood in the immediate  neighbourhood of the mouth, which has exposed the ice to the assaults of  the weather. The commune has let the glaciere for a term of nine years,  receiving six or seven hundred francs in all; and the _fermier_ extracts  the ice, and sells it in Geneva and Lausanne. In hot summers, the  supplies of the artificial ice-houses fail; and then the hotel-keepers  have recourse to the stores laid up for them by nature in the Glacieres  of S. Georges and S. Livres. Hence the importance of protecting the  ice; the necessity for so doing arising in this case from the fact that  the entrance to the cave is by a hole in the roof, which exposes the ice  to direct radiation, unlike all other glacieres, excepting perhaps the  _Cueva del Hielo_ on the Peak of Teneriffe.[14]    Autumn appears to be the usual time for cutting the ice, when it is  carried from the cave on men's backs as far as the commencement of the  rough mountain-road, and is there packed on chars, and so conveyed to  the nearest railway station. Renaud had worked in the cave for two  years, and asserted that they did not choose the night for carrying  the ice down to the station, and did not even care to choose a cool  day. He believed that, in the autumn of 1863, they loaded two chars a  day for fifteen days, and each char took from 40 to 50 quintaux; the  quintal containing 50 kilos, or 100 livres.[15] In Professor Pictet's  time (1822) this glaciere supplied the Hospital of Geneva, whose  income depended in part on its privilege of _revente_ of all ice sold  in the town, with 25 quintaux every other day during the summer. In my  anxiety to learn the exact amount of ice now supplied by the glaciere,  I determined to find out the _fermier_; but Renaud could tell nothing  of him beyond the fact that he lived in Geneva, which some promiscuous  person supplemented by the information that his name was Boucqueville,  and that he had something to do with comestibles. On entering upon a  hunt for M. Boucqueville a fortnight later, it turned out that no one  had heard of such a person, and the Directory professed equal  ignorance; but, under the head of 'Comestibles,' there appeared a  Gignoux-Bocquet, No. 34, Marche. Thirty-four, Marche, said, yes--M.  Bocquet--it was quite true: nevertheless, it was clear that monsieur  meant Sebastian aine, on the Molard. The Molard knew only a younger  Sebastian, but suggested that the right man was probably M.  Gignoux-Chavaz, over the way; and when it was objected that  Gignoux-Bocquet, and not Gignoux-Chavaz, was the name, the Molard  replied that it made no matter,--Chavaz or Bocquet, it was all the  same. When M. Gignoux-Chavaz was found, he said that he certainly was  a man who had something to do with a glaciere, but, instead of farming  the Glaciere of S. Georges, he had only bought a considerable quantity  of ice two years ago from the Glaciere of S. Livres, and he did not  believe that the _fermier_ of S. Georges lived in Geneva. Part of the  confusion was due to the custom of placing a wife's maiden name after  her husband's name: thus Gignoux-Chavaz implies that a male Gignoux  has married a female Chavaz; and when a Swiss marries an English lady  with a very English name, the result in the Continental mouth is  sufficiently curious.    On arriving at the entrance to the glaciere, the end of a suggestive  ladder is seen under the protecting trunks; and after one or two steps  have been taken down the ladder, the effect of the cave below is  extremely remarkable, the main features being a long wall covered  thickly with white ice in sheets, a solid floor of darker-coloured ice,  and a high pyramid of snow reaching up towards the uncovered hole  already spoken of. The atmosphere of the cave is damp, and this causes  the ladders to fall speedily to decay, so that they are by no means to  be trusted: indeed, an early round gave way under one of my sisters,  when they visited the cave with me in 1861, and suggested a clear fall  of 60 feet on to a cascade of ice.[16] There are three ladders, one  below the other, and a hasty measurement gave their lengths as 20, 16,  and 28 feet. The rock-roof is only a few feet thick in the neighbourhood  of the hole of entrance.    [Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE GLACIERE OF S. GEORGES.]    The total length of the cave is 110 feet, lying NE. and SW., in the line  of the main chain of the Jura. The lowest part of the floor is a sea of  ice of unknown depth, 45 feet long by 15 broad; and Renaud tried my  powers of belief by asserting that in 1834 the level of this floor was  higher by half the height of the cave than now; a statement, however,  which is fully borne out by Professor Pictet's measurements in 1822,  when the depth of the glaciere was less than 30 feet. Indeed, the floor  had sunk considerably since my previous visit, when it was all at the  same level down to the further end of the cave; whereas now, as will be  seen in the section, there was a platform of stones resting on ice at  that end. There are two large fissures passing into the rock, one only  of which can be represented in the section, and these were full of white  ice, not owing its whiteness apparently to the admixture of air in  bubbles, but firm and compact, and very hard, almost like porcelain.  Small stalactites hung from round fissures in the roof, formed of the  same sort of ice, and broken off short, much as the end of a leaden pipe  is sometimes seen to project from a wall. With this exception, there was  no ice hanging from the roof, though there were abundant signs of very  fine columns which had already yielded to the advancing warmth: one of  these still remained, in the form of broken blocks of ice, in the  neighbourhood of the open hole in the roof, immediately below which hole  the stones of the floor were completely bare, and the thermometer stood  at 50 deg.. At the far end of the cave, the thermometer gave something less  than "]]]
