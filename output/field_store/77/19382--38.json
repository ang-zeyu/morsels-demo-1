The Aisne is a sluggish stream of some 170 feet in breadth, but, being  15 feet deep in the centre, it is unfordable. Between Soissons on the  west and Villiers on the east (the part of the river attacked and  secured by the British forces) there are eleven road bridges across it.  On the north bank a narrow-gauge railway runs from Soissons to Vailly,  where it crosses the river and continues eastward along the south bank.  From Soissons to Sermoise a double line of railway runs along the south  bank, turning at the latter place up the Vesle Valley toward Bazoches.    The position held by the enemy is a very strong one, either for delaying  action or for a defensive battle. One of its chief military  characteristics is that from the high ground on neither side can the top  of the plateau on the other side be seen, except for small stretches.  This is chiefly due to the woods on the edges of the slopes. Another  important point is that all the bridges are under direct or high-angle  artillery fire.    The tract of country above described, which lies north of the Aisne, is  well adapted to concealment, and was so skillfully turned to account by  the enemy as to render it impossible to judge the real nature of his  opposition to our passage of the river or accurately to gauge his  strength; but I have every reason to conclude that strong rearguards of  at least three army corps were holding the passages on the early morning  of the 13th.    3. On that morning I ordered the British forces to advance and make good  the Aisne.    The First Corps and the cavalry advanced on the river. The First  Division was directed on Chamouille via the canal bridge at Bourg, and  the Second Division on Courtecon and Presles via Pont-Arcy, and on the  canal to the north of Braye via Chavonne. On the right the cavalry and  First Division met with slight opposition and found a passage by means  of the canal, which crosses the river by an aqueduct. The division was  therefore able to press on, supported by the cavalry division on its  outer flank, driving back the enemy in front of it.    On the left the leading troops of the Second Division reached the river  by 9 o'clock. The Fifth Infantry Brigade were only enabled to cross, in  single file and under considerable shell fire, by means of the broken  girder of the bridge, which was not entirely submerged in the river. The  construction of a pontoon bridge was at once undertaken, and was  completed by 5 o'clock in the afternoon.    On the extreme left the Fourth Guards Brigade met with severe opposition  at Chavonne, and it was only late in the afternoon that it was able to  establish a foothold on the northern bank of the river by ferrying one  battalion across in boats.    By nightfall the First Division occupied the area of  Moulins-Paissy-Geny, with posts at the village of Vendresse.    The Second Division bivouacked as a whole on the southern bank of the  river, leaving only the Fifth Brigade on the north bank to establish a  bridge-head.    The Second Corps found all the bridges in front of them destroyed except  that of Conde, which was in possession of the enemy, and remained so  until the end of the battle.    In the approach to Missy, where the Fifth Division eventually crossed,  there is some open ground which was swept by a heavy fire from the  opposite bank. The Thirteenth Brigade was therefore unable to advance;  but the Fourteenth, which was directed to the east of Venizel at a less  exposed point, was rafted across, and by night established itself with  its left at St. Marguerite. They were followed by the Fifteenth Brigade;  and later on both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth supported the Fourth  Division on their left in repelling a heavy counter-attack on the Third  Corps.    On the morning of the 13th the Third Corps found the enemy had  established himself in strength on the Vregny plateau. The road bridge  at Venizel was repaired during the morning, and a reconnoissance was  made with a view to throwing a pontoon bridge at Soissons.    The Twelfth Infantry Brigade crossed at Venizel, and was assembled at  Bucy le Long by 1 P.M., but the bridge was so far damaged that  artillery could only be man-handled across it. Meanwhile the  construction of a bridge was commenced close to the road bridge at  Venizel.    At 2 P.M. the Twelfth Infantry Brigade attacked in the direction of  Chivres and Vregny with the object of securing the high ground east of  Chivres, as a necessary preliminary to a further advance northward. This  attack made good progress, but at 5:30 P.M. the enemy's artillery and  machine gun fire from the direction of Vregny became so severe that no  further advance could be made. The positions reached were held till  dark.    The pontoon bridge at Venizel was completed at 5:30 P.M., when the Tenth  Infantry Brigade crossed the river and moved to Bucy le Long.    The Nineteenth Infantry Brigade moved to Billy-sur-Aisne, and before  dark all the artillery of the division had crossed the river, with the  exception of the heavy battery and one brigade of field artillery.    During the night the positions gained by the Twelfth Infantry Brigade to  the east of the stream running through Chivres were handed over to the  Fifth Division.    The section of the bridging train allotted to the Third Corps began to  arrive in the neighborhood of Soissons late in the afternoon, when an  attempt to throw a heavy pontoon bridge at Soissons had to be abandoned,  owing to the fire of the enemy's heavy howitzers.    In the evening the enemy retired at all points and intrenched himself on  the high ground about two miles north of the river, along which runs the  Chemin-des-Dames. Detachments of infantry, however, strongly intrenched  in commanding points down slopes of the various spurs, were left in  front of all three corps with powerful artillery in support of them.    During the night of the 13th and on the 14th and following days the  field companies were incessantly at work night and day. Eight pontoon  bridges and one foot bridge were thrown across the river under  generally very heavy artillery fire, which was incessantly kept up on to  most of the crossings after completion. Three of the road bridges, i.e.,  Venizel, Missy, and Vailly, and the railway bridge east of Vailly, were  temporarily repaired so as to take foot traffic, and the Villiers Bridge  made fit to carry weights up to six tons.    Preparations were also made for the repair of the Missy, Vailly and  Bourg bridges so as to take mechanical transport.    The weather was very wet and added to the difficulties by cutting up the  already indifferent approaches, entailing a large amount of work to  repair and improve.    The operations of the field companies during this most trying time are  worthy of the best traditions of the Royal Engineers.    4. On the evening of the 14th it was still impossible to decide whether  the enemy was only making a temporary halt, covered by rearguards, or  whether he intended to stand and defend the position.    With a view to clearing up the situation I ordered a general advance.    The action of the First Corps on this day under the direction and  command of Sir Douglas Haig was of so skillful, bold, and decisive a  character that he gained positions which alone have enabled me to  maintain my position for more than three weeks of very severe fighting  on the north bank of the river.    The corps was directed to cross the line Moulins-Moussy by 7 A.M.    On the right the General Officer commanding the First Division directed  the Second Infantry Brigade (which was in billets and bivouacked about  Moulins), and the Twenty-fifth Artillery Brigade (less one battery),  under Gen. Bulfin, to move forward before daybreak, in order to protect  the advance of the division sent up the valley to Vendresse. An  officer's patrol sent out by this brigade reported a considerable force  of the enemy near the factory north of Troyon, and the Brigadier  accordingly directed two regiments (the King's Royal Rifles and the  Royal Sussex Regiment) to move at 3 A.M. The Northamptonshire Regiment  was ordered to move at 4 A.M. to occupy the spur east of Troyon. The  remaining regiment of the brigade (the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment)  moved at 5:30 A.M. to the village of Vendresse. The factory was found to  be held in considerable strength by the enemy, and the Brigadier ordered  the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment to support the King's Royal Rifles  and the Sussex Regiment. Even with this support the force was unable to  make headway, and on the arrival of the First Brigade the Coldstream  Guards were moved up to support the right of the leading brigade (the  Second), while the remainder of the First Brigade supported its left.    [Illustration: Map 8.--Sept. 10 to 12. Showing the Germans' headlong  retreat to their intrenched positions beyond the Aisne.]    About noon the situation was, roughly, that the whole of these two  brigades were extended along a line running east and west, north of the  line Troyon and south of the Chemin-des-Dames. A party of the Loyal  North Lancashire Regiment had seized and were holding the factory. The  enemy had a line of intrenchments north and east of the factory in  considerable strength, and every effort to advance against this line was  driven back by heavy shell and machine-gun fire. The morning was wet and  a heavy mist hung over the hills, so that the Twenty-fifth Artillery  Brigade and the divisional artillery were unable to render effective  support to the advanced troops until about 9 o'clock.    By 10 o'clock the Third Infantry Brigade had reached a point one mile  south of Vendresse, and from there it was ordered to continue the line  of the First Brigade and to connect with and help the right of the  Second Division. A strong hostile column was found to be advancing, and  by a vigorous counterstroke"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16370"],[0,"Lameness of the Horse (#5)"],[1,", if the contusion is of sufficient violence, result in  arthritis and periarthritis. In inactive farm horses, during cold  weather, this condition becomes chronic, swelling remains for weeks  after all lameness and pain have subsided and occasionally hyperthrophy  is permanent.    Arthritis occasioned by indirect injury, such as characterizes joint  inflammation from continuous concussion, is seen in horses that are  worked at a rapid pace on city streets or other hard road surfaces. Such  affections may be acute, as in some cases of spavin, but are usually  inflammatory conditions that do not occasion serious disturbance when  these affections become chronic. If the involvement persists with  sufficient active inflammation, there may follow erosion of cartilage  and incurable lameness. If extensive necrosis of cartilage takes place,  the attendant pain will be sufficient to cause the animal to favor the  diseased part and such immobilization enhances early ankylosis--nature's  substitute for resolution in this disease.    Wounds invading the tissues adjacent to joints, when these wounds are of  considerable extent, cause inflammation of such articulations by  contiguous extension of inflammation. As long as an injury remains  practically aseptic, or if infected and the septic process does not  involve the joint proper by direct extension, no more serious  disturbance than a simple synovitis will result. If, instead, a  periarthritic inflammation is serious or destructive in character, the  type of arthritis will be grave--even though due to an indirect cause.    Where a vulnerant body penetrates all structures and invades the  interior of the joint capsule the result is that a more or less active  disturbance is incited. The introduction of a sterile instrument into a  joint cavity, under strict asepsis, where a perfect technic is executed,  does not cause perceptible manifestation of the injury, if the opening  so made is small--such as a suitable exploratory trocar makes. But a  puncture made in a similar manner and with the same instrument without  due regard to asepsis is likely to cause an infectious synovitis and  arthritis usually follows.    A larger opening than is produced by means of an exploratory trochar may  be made into a joint cavity, causing escape of synovia as it is secreted  for days and even for weeks and no serious or permanent trouble is  experienced in some cases. If the synovitis or arthritis remains  non-infected and the wound, traumatic or surgical, is not too large,  healing by granulation occurs, and the discharge of synovia ceases.  However, if synovial discharge persists too long because of tardy  closure of an open joint, there is great danger of infection gaining  entrance into the synovial cavity, or in some instances, desiccation of  endothelial cells of the articulation occurs, in areas, and the  reactionary inflammation eventually results in ankylosis.    A small puncture which introduces into the synovial cavity infectious  material of active virulence will cause an arthritis that is more  serious, much more painful and more difficult to handle than is  occasioned by a wound of moderate size, that affords ready escape of  synovia even through the virulence of the infection be the same.    Synovia is a good culture medium and the environment is ideal for  multiplication of bacteria; consequently, the grave disturbances which  may attend the introduction of pathogenic organisms into a synovial  cavity as the result of a puncture wound are not to be forgotten. The  veterinarian is in no position to estimate the virulency of organisms so  introduced; neither can he determine the exact degree of resistance  possessed by the subject in any given case. Therefore, he is uncertain  as to the best method of handling such cases where an injury has been  recently inflicted and positive evidence of the existence of an  infectious synovitis is not present. If one could determine in advance  the degree of infection and injury that is to follow small penetrant  wounds of joint capsules, it would then be possible to select certain  cases and immediately drain away all synovia and fill the cavity by  injection with suitable antiseptic solutions.    This offers a broad field for experimentation which will in time be  productive of a radical change in the manner of treating such cases.    _Metastatic arthritis_ is seen more frequently in colts or young animals  than in mature horses and we here take the liberty of classifying with  the arthritis of omphalophlebitis and strangles the so-called rheumatic  variety.    A specific polyarthritis or synovitis which attends navel infection of  foals is perhaps the most frequent form of arthritis that is to be  considered metastatic. This condition is truly a disease of young  animals and, while it is a specific arthritis, the cause is yet to be  attributed to any definite pathogenic organism with certainty. This  condition is well defined by Bollinger as quoted by Hoare,[1] when he  calls it a purulent omphalophlebitis due to local infection of the  umbilicus and umbilical vessels, by pyogenic organisms, causing a  metastatic pyemia.    This affection is grave; its course is comparatively brief; the  prognosis is usually unfavorable; and omphalophlebitis occasions a form  of lameness which at once impresses the practitioner that serious  constitutional disturbance exists. Its consideration properly belongs to  discussions on practice or obstetrics and diseases of the new born, and  it has received careful attention and is discussed at length in these  works.    A second form of metastatic arthritis is met with in strangles.  Strangles occurs in the young principally and is not a frequent cause of  synovitis or arthritis in the adult animal.    Strangles or distemper is, according to most pathologists, due to the  Streptococcus equi. Hoare[2] states that in this type of specific  arthritis the contagium is probably carried by the blood. He gives it as  his opinion that even laminitis has occurred as a result of the  streptococcus-equi. This, indeed, would point toward probable extension  by the blood as well as by way of lymph vessels.    Septic synovitis and infectious arthritis are always serious affections  even in young animals and much depends upon individual resistance and  early rational treatment in such cases, if recovery is to follow.    The same general plan of treatment is indicated in this kind of septic  synovitis as is employed in all cases of infective synovitis and septic  infection in open joints. There is to be considered, however, the fact  that the young animal is more agile, a better self-nurse, and in a  general way more apt to recover than is the adult, under similar  conditions.    _Rheumatic arthritis_, if one is justified in classifying rheumatic  inflammation of joints as a metastatic form of arthritis, is not a  common condition, though seen in mature and aged animals. Cases that may  be diagnosed with certainty are usually advanced affections wherein  dependable history is obtainable and the symptoms are well marked.    Rheumatism may be thought of, with respect to arthritic inflammation  caused thereby, as a sort of pyemia. Undoubtedly, exposure to wet and  cold weather is an active factor, but probably a predisposing one only.  Likewise a member that suffers from chronic inflammation due to  recurrent injury or to constant or repeated strain is less able to  resist the vicissitudes of climate and work.    Consequently, rheumatic arthritis is to be seen affecting horses that  are in service, more often at heavy draft work where they are exposed to  severe straining of joints; where stabling is insanitary; and where they  are obliged to lie down (if they do not remain standing) upon cold and  wet ground or upon hard unbedded floors or paving.    Where such inhumane and cruel treatment is given animals those  responsible ought to be impressed with the unfairness to the animal as  well as the economic loss occasioned by inflicting such unnecessary and  merciless treatment upon their helpless and uncomplaining subjects. The  very nature of the veterinarian's work affords him constant and frequent  opportunity to convince those who are responsible for keeping animals in  this manner, that it is inhumane and unprofitable.    Cases of this kind are not uncommon about some grading and lumbering  camps and in contract work where, often, shelter for animals is given  little thought; the result is a cruel waste of horseflesh.    Chronic articular rheumatism is occasionally observed in young animals  that have never been in service. In these cases it seems that there  exists an individual susceptibility and in some instances the condition  is recurrent. Each attack is of longer duration, and eventually death  results from continued suffering, emaciation and intoxication.      AFFECTIONS OF BURSAE AND THECAE.    Acute bursitis and thecitis is of frequent occurrence in horses because  of direct injury from contusion, punctures and other forms of  traumatism. These synovial membranes, with few exceptions, when inflamed  occasion a synovitis that may be very acute, yet there is less  manifestation of pain than in arthritis.    It is only in structures such as the bursa intertubercularis or in the  sheath of the deep digital flexor that an inflammation causes much pain  and is apt to result in permanent lameness. This is due to the peculiar  character of the function of such structures.    An acute inflammation of a small bursa may even result in the  destruction of such synovial apparatus without serious inconvenience to  the subject, either at the time of destruction or thereafter.  Obliteration of the superficial bursa over the summit of the os calcis  is not likely to cause serious inconvenience or distress to the subject  unless it be due to an infected wound. Even then, with reasonably good  care given the animal, recovery is"]]]
