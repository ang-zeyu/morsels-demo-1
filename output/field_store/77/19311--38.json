Thus, fed and sheltered by Thy matchless might,    The lions' hideous roar could not affright      Thy loyal servant in the days of old:    He boldly cursed the molten deity    And stood with stubborn head uplifted high      That scorned to bow before a god of gold.      Then Babylon's vile mob with fury glows;    Death is his doom; and straight the tyrant throws      The youth to be his savage lions' prey:    But faith and piety Thou still dost save,    For lo! the untamed brutes no longer rave,      But round God's unscathed child they gently play.      Close by his side they stand with drooping mane,    The grisly, gaping jaws from blood refrain      And with rough tongues their whilom prey caress:    But when in prayer he raised his hands to heaven    And called the God, from Whom such help was given,      Close-prisoned, hungry, and in sore distress,      A winged messenger to earth He sends,    Who swiftly through the parting clouds descends      To feed His servant, proven by the test:    By chance he sees from far the unbought fare    Which the good seer Habakkuk's kindly care      With rustic art had for the reapers dressed:      Then, grasping in strong hand the prophet's hair,    He bears him gently through the rushing air,      Still burdened with the platter's savoury load,    Till o'er the lions' den at last they stayed    And straightway to the starving youth displayed      The food thus brought, by God's good grace bestowed.      \"Take this with joy,\" he said, \"and thankful feed,    The bread that in thy hour of direst need,      By the great Father sent, Christ's angel brings.\"    Then Daniel lifts his eyes to heaven above    And, strengthened by the wondrous gift of love,      \"Amen!\" he cries, and Alleluia sings.      Thus, therefore, by Thy bounties now restored,    Giver of all things good, Almighty Lord,      We render thanks and sing glad hymns to Thee:    Though prisoned in an evil world we dwell    Where sin's grim tyrant rules, Thou dost repel      With sovran power our mortal enemy.      He roars around us, and would fain devour,    Grinding his angry teeth when 'gainst his power      In Thee alone, O God, we still confide:    By evil things we are beset and vexed,    Tormented, hated, harassed and perplexed,      Our faith by cruel suffering sorely tried,      Yet help ne'er fails us in our time of need,    For Thou canst quell the lions' rage, and feed      Our hungry spirits with celestial fare:    And if some soul no meagre taste would gain    Of that repast, but thirstily is fain      Full measure of the heavenly sweets to share,      He by the holy seers of old is fed,    And shall partake the loyal reapers' bread      Who labour in the eternal Master's field:    For nothing sweeter than the Word can be    That fell from righteous lips, once touched by Thee,      And nought can richer grace to mortals yield.      With this sustained, though vaunting tyranny    By unjust judgment doom us straight to die,      And starved lions rush these limbs to tear;    Confessing ever Thine Eternal Son,    With Thee, Almighty Father, ever one,      His cross with faith unshaken will we bear.

The employment of the mouth as a sexual organ is considered as a  perversion if the lips (tongue) of the one are brought into contact with  the genitals of the other, but not when the mucous membrane of the lips  of both touch each other. In the latter exception we find the connection  with the normal. He who abhors the former as perversions, though these  since antiquity have been common practices among mankind, yields to a  distinct _feeling of loathing_ which protects him from adopting such  sexual aims. The limit of such loathing is frequently purely  conventional; he who kisses fervently the lips of a pretty girl will  perhaps be able to use her tooth brush only with a sense of loathing,  though there is no reason to assume that his own oral cavity for which  he entertains no loathing is cleaner than that of the girl. Our  attention is here called to the factor of loathing which stands in the  way of the libidinous overestimation of the sexual aim, but which may  in turn be vanquished by the libido. In the loathing we may observe one  of the forces which have brought about the restrictions of the sexual  aim. As a rule these forces halt at the genitals; there is, however, no  doubt that even the genitals of the other sex themselves may be an  object of loathing. Such behavior is characteristic of all hysterics,  especially women. The force of the sexual impulse prefers to occupy  itself with the overcoming of this loathing (see below).    *Sexual Utilization of the Anal Opening.*--It is even more obvious than  in the former case that it is the loathing which stamps as a perversion  the use of the anus as a sexual aim. But it should not be interpreted as  espousing a cause when I observe that the basis of this  loathing--namely, that this part of the body serves for the excretion  and comes in contact with the loathsome excrement--is not more plausible  than the basis which hysterical girls have for the disgust which they  entertain for the male genital because it serves for urination.    The sexual role of the mucous membrane of the anus is by no means  limited to intercourse between men; its preference has nothing  characteristic of the inverted feeling. On the contrary, it seems that  the _pedicatio_ of the man owes its role to the analogy with the act in  the woman, whereas among inverts it is mutual masturbation which is the  most common sexual aim.    *The Significance of Other Parts of the Body.*--Sexual infringement on  the other parts of the body, in all its variations, offers nothing new;  it adds nothing to our knowledge of the sexual impulse which herein only  announces its intention to dominate the sexual object in every way.  Besides the sexual overvaluation, a second and generally unknown factor  may be mentioned among the anatomical transgressions. Certain parts of  the body, like the mucous membrane of the mouth and anus, which  repeatedly appear in such practices, lay claim as it were to be  considered and treated as genitals. We shall hear how this claim is  justified by the development of the sexual impulse, and how it is  fulfilled in the symptomatology of certain morbid conditions.    *Unfit Substitutes for the Sexual Object. Fetichism.*--We are especially  impressed by those cases in which for the normal sexual object another  is substituted which is related to it but which is totally unfit for the  normal sexual aim. According to the scheme of the introduction we should  have done better to mention this most interesting group of aberrations  of the sexual impulse among the deviations in reference to the sexual  object, but we have deferred mention of these until we became acquainted  with the factor of sexual overestimation, upon which these  manifestations, connected with the relinquishing of the sexual aim,  depend.    The substitute for the sexual object is generally a part of the body but  little adapted for sexual purposes, such as the foot, or hair, or an  inanimate object which is in demonstrable relation with the sexual  person, and preferably with the sexuality of the same (fragments of  clothing, white underwear). This substitution is not unjustly compared  with the fetich in which the savage sees the embodiment of his god.    The transition to the cases of fetichism, with a renunciation of a  normal or of a perverted sexual aim, is formed by cases in which a  fetichistic determination is demanded in the sexual object if the sexual  aim is to be attained (definite color of hair, clothing, even physical  blemishes). No other variation of the sexual impulse verging on the  pathological claims our interest as much as this one, owing to the  peculiarity occasioned by its manifestations. A certain diminution in  the striving for the normal sexual aim may be presupposed in all these  cases (executive weakness of the sexual apparatus).[17] The connection  with the normal is occasioned by the psychologically necessary  overestimation of the sexual object, which inevitably encroaches upon  everything associatively related to it (sexual object). A certain degree  of such fetichism therefore regularly belong to the normal, especially  during those stages of wooing when the normal sexual aim seems  inaccessible or its realization deferred.         \"Get me a handkerchief from her bosom--a garter of my love.\"                                                          --FAUST.    The case becomes pathological only when the striving for the fetich  fixes itself beyond such determinations and takes the place of the  normal sexual aim; or again, when the fetich disengages itself from the  person concerned and itself becomes a sexual object. These are the  general determinations for the transition of mere variations of the  sexual impulse into pathological aberrations.    The persistent influence of a sexual impress mostly received in early  childhood often shows itself in the selection of a fetich, as Binet  first asserted, and as was later proven by many illustrations,--a thing  which may be placed parallel to the proverbial attachment to a first  love in the normal (\"On revient toujours a ses premiers amours\"). Such a  connection is especially seen in cases with only fetichistic  determinations of the sexual object. The significance of early sexual  impressions will be met again in other places.    In other cases it was mostly a symbolic thought association, unconscious  to the person concerned, which led to the replacing of the object by  means of a fetich. The paths of these connections can not always be  definitely demonstrated. The foot is a very primitive sexual symbol  already found in myths.[18] Fur is used as a fetich probably on account  of its association with the hairiness of the mons veneris. Such  symbolism seems often to depend on sexual experiences in childhood.[19]      (_b_) _Fixation of Precursory Sexual Aims_    *The Appearance of New Intentions.*--All the outer and inner  determinations which impede or hold at a distance the attainment of the  normal sexual aim, such as impotence, costliness of the sexual object,  and dangers of the sexual act, will conceivably strengthen the  inclination to linger at the preparatory acts and to form them into new  sexual aims which may take the place of the normal. On closer  investigation it is always seen that the ostensibly most peculiar of  these new intentions have already been indicated in the normal sexual  act.    *Touching and Looking.*--At least a certain amount of touching is  indispensable for a person in order to attain the normal sexual aim. It  is also generally known that the touching of the skin of the sexual  object causes much pleasure and produces a supply of new excitement.  Hence, the lingering at the touching can hardly be considered a  perversion if the sexual act is proceeded with.    The same holds true in the end with looking which is analogous to  touching. The manner in which the libidinous excitement is frequently  awakened is by the optical impression, and selection takes account of  this circumstance--if this teleological mode of thinking be  permitted--by making the sexual object a thing of beauty. The covering  of the body, which keeps abreast with civilization, serves to arouse  sexual inquisitiveness, which always strives to restore for itself the  sexual object by uncovering the hidden parts. This can be turned into  the artistic (\"sublimation\") if the interest is turned from the genitals  to the form of the body.[20] The tendency to linger at this intermediary  sexual aim of the sexually accentuated looking is found to a certain  degree in most normals; indeed it gives them the possibility of  directing a certain amount of their libido to a higher artistic aim. On  the other hand, the fondness for looking becomes a perversion (_a_) when  it limits itself entirely to the genitals; (_b_) when it becomes connected  with the overcoming of loathing (voyeurs and onlookers at the functions  of excretion); and (_c_) when instead of preparing for the normal sexual  aim it suppresses it. The latter, if I may draw conclusions from a  single analysis, is in a most pronounced way true of exhibitionists, who  expose their genitals so as in turn to bring to view the genitals of  others.    In the perversion which consists in striving to look and be looked at we  are confronted with a very remarkable character which will occupy us  even more intensively in the following aberration. The sexual aim is  here present in twofold formation, in an _active_ and a _passive_ form.    The force "]]]
