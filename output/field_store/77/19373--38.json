One of the men got an ineffectual shot at them.    FIRST HILLS OF THE SOUTHERN IRONSTONE FORMATION.    After traversing these plains for two miles in a south-east direction we  came upon a valley through which flowed a branch of the river we had this  day discovered, running in a bed of fifty yards across, and having in its  centre a rapid stream falling in small cascades; it appeared at times  subject to extensive inundations, and here its course was through barren  plains covered with rocks piled up in strange fantastic masses, and the  bed was composed of that kind of red sandstone which at Perth is called  ironstone; this being the farthest point north at which I have remarked  it.    A number of grass-trees (Xanthorrhoea) grew near the spot where we had  halted; they appeared unhealthy and stunted, but indeed I suspect they  are a new and undescribed variety. Being desirous of procuring anything I  could for the men to eat I had the tops of some of these trees cut off  and boiled, they were however still so hard that to chew them was  impossible, and it was evident that we had not yet reached a parallel of  latitude calculated to produce tender-topped grass trees.    I knew our latitude and position this night exactly, as I had seen Mount  Naturaliste of the French in the course of the day. There could be no  doubt whatever that we were in a very remarkable district, for we stood  upon the point where the geological formations of the north-western and  south-western portions of the continent were associated together, and the  flora of which was so made up of those of both that it was impossible to  tell which predominated. There were many other interesting circumstances  connected with the surrounding country, some of which have been already  mentioned. I named the river and estuary now discovered the Hutt after  William Hutt, Esquire, M.P., brother of His Excellency the Governor of  Western Australia.    INDISPOSITION OF MR. SMITH.    Mr. Smith this day complained of weakness, not sufficiently however in  the least to alarm me. He had hitherto been nearly always in the rear of  the party without lagging, but I thought two of the men in a much weaker  state than he was.      CHAPTER 2. FROM THE HUTT RIVER TO WATER PEAK.    WILD TURKEYS SEEN.    April 6.    We moved off this morning on a course of 180 degrees. The first mile of  our journey was over low scrubby ironstone hills. We then came down upon  rich flats through which the main branch of the Hutt ran; and followed  the course of this branch for about two miles. It was not running but  there were many pools with water in its bed: the flats were rich and  grassy and on the hills to the westward (the Menai Hills) we descried  wild turkeys, being the farthest point north at which I had seen this  bird.    As I saw that the ground in front of us was very steep and abrupt, so  that the weak and weary would have found it a difficult task to master  such an ascent, I turned off on a course of 168 degrees, ascending a  sandy tableland covered with scrub. When we had walked three miles in  this direction the table-hill of Captain King bore east by south distant  five miles. We now proceeded parallel to the sea, which was distant one  mile through an indifferent country. This course continued for about five  miles, and on the ranges to the eastward the country still appeared to be  grassy and good.    RELUCTANCE OF THE MEN TO HASTEN ONWARDS. DIFFICULTY OF URGING THE PARTY  FORWARD.    Although we had walked very slowly many of the party were completely  exhausted, and one or two of the discontented ones pretended to be  dreadfully in want of water, notwithstanding they carried canteens and  had only walked eight miles since leaving the bank of a river; I was  therefore obliged to halt, and could not get them to move for three  hours. I am sorry to say that some who should have known much better  endeavoured to instil into the minds of the men that it was preferable  only to walk a few miles a day and not to waste their strength by long  marches; utterly forgetting that most of the party had now only seven or  eight pounds of fermented flour left, and that if they did not make play  whilst they had strength their eventually reaching Perth was quite  hopeless. This however was a very popular doctrine for thoughtless and  weary men, who were overloaded and yet from a feeling of avarice would  not abandon any portion of what they were carrying. The majority of the  party not only adopted these views in theory but doggedly carried them  into practice; and from this moment I abandoned all hope of getting the  whole party into the settled districts in safety. Poor fellows! most of  them paid dearly for the mistaken notions they now adopted. Mr. Smith,  with his usual spirit, was for pushing on, although his strength was  inadequate to the task. I laid under the shade of a bush lost in gloomy  reveries and temporary unpopularity; Kaiber by my side lulled me with  native songs composed for the occasion, and in prospective I saw all the  dread sufferings which were to befall the doomed men who sat around me,  confident of their success under the new plan; but like all prophets I  was without honour amongst my own acquaintance; and after considering the  matter under every point of view I thought it better for the moment to  succumb to the general feeling, yet to lose no opportunity on every  subsequent occasion of endeavouring to rouse the party into a degree of  energy suited to our desperate circumstances.    At the end of the three hours I again begged several of the party, who  appeared to be in an exhausted state, to abandon a portion of their  useless loads; but they were quite sure that by making short marches, not  exhausting their strength, and now and then halting for a day or two to  refresh, they could carry them into Perth, and therefore refused to part  with them. Mr. Smith and myself found that stopping in this way and  getting cold rendered our limbs so stiff and painful when we walked on  again that we could scarcely move; and I suspect that such was the case  with the other men, for when we started again I could hardly get them  along. One man of the name of Stiles, who was a stout supporter of the  new theory, made us stop for him nearly every five minutes.    THE BOWES RIVER.    After walking one mile we fortunately came to a very deep valley, having  such steep limestone cliffs on each side that it assumed quite the  character of a ravine: it was about a mile wide and in it was a  watercourse winding through deep flats. We however only found water in  pools; the course of the stream was very tortuous and its mouth was  almost blocked up by sandhills. The valley itself was both picturesque  and fertile, and the appearance of the country to the east and north-east  was highly promising. The stream I called the Bowes.    NATIVE RESTING-PLACE. NATIVE HUTS.    This spot was a favourite halting-place of the natives; and from the  number of huts and other indications which we saw the district must be  very densely populated. The huts were of the same superior construction  as those which we had seen near the Hutt, and the traces were very  recent, but the natives themselves were either at a distance or kept  carefully out of our way. The valley that we were now in, as well as the  other limestone valleys in this province, partook exactly of the  character of those in the carboniferous limestone districts of England  inasmuch as they were deep gorges, or ravines, now traversed by  watercourses or streams apparently much too insignificant to have grooved  them out.    PROVOKING INDOLENCE OF THE MEN.    Our finding water here was fortunate for I now showed the men that, had  they walked one mile farther instead of halting in the manner they had  done, they would have had abundance of it, and would have been, at this  moment, at least, five miles nearer home. I also directed Mr. Walker to  examine Stiles and to state whether he was in good health or not. He did  so and reported him quite well. I therefore when we started again gave  Stiles warning that I should not halt every minute for him but would  leave him behind, at the same time ordering him to walk in front of the  party, next after me.    I continued a course of 180 degrees up a steep limestone range, behind  which apparently ran a branch of the watercourse we had just passed: a  good country lay to the eastward of us. Stiles now delayed us so much  that some of his comrades spoke to him very warmly on the subject, whilst  others still held to the opinion that walking a few miles a day and  sometimes halting a day or two to refresh was the true mode of  proceeding. We only made two miles this evening and I threw myself on the  ground so worn and harassed that I could not sleep.    AN EXTENSIVE FERTILE COUNTRY.    Sunday April 7.    Before the sun had appeared above the horizon I managed to get the party  fairly started, and we followed a course of 180 degrees over elevated  sandy downs which rested on a limestone formation. The first four miles  of our journey was not very encouraging; we could only see as far to the  eastward as the flat-topped range; and although the slopes of these hills  looked very fertile I had no means of judging how far back this good  country extended; we had however been creeping gradually up an ascent,  and when we gained the summit of this I turned to look to the northward  after the straggling party, who were slowly mounting the hill, some of  them staggering along under loads so heavy that I should have hated the  tyranny of any man who could have compelled them to carry such a weight;  but as it was I could only grieve to see men, from the hope of gain,  rushing so inevitably on their fate.

Now, the man who lives alone presently developes some of the recognised  eccentricities of the recluse, which, on his return to society, cause  him to be regarded as a maniac; and the man who lives entirely in the  present cannot argue that the characteristics which he has developed are  less maniacal because they are shared by his associates. Rapidly he,  too, has become eccentric; and just as the solitary man must needs come  into the company of his fellows if he would retain a healthy mind, so  the man who lives in the present must allow himself occasional  intercourse with the past if he would keep his balance.

Brugsch Pasha._      Heraclitus, in a quotation preserved by Sextus Empiricus,[1] writes: \"It  behoves us to follow the common reason of the world; yet, though there  is a common reason in the world, the majority live as though they  possessed a wisdom peculiar each unto himself alone.\" Every one of us  who considers his mentality an important part of his constitution should  endeavour to give himself ample opportunities of adjusting his mind to  this \"common reason\" which is the silver thread that runs unbroken  throughout history. We should remember the yesterdays, that we may know  what the pother of to-day is about; and we should foretell to-morrow not  by to-day but by every day that has been.        [Footnote 1: Bywater: 'Heracliti Ephesii Reliquiae,' p. 38.]    Forgetfulness is so common a human failing. In our rapid transit through  life we are so inclined to forget the past stages of the journey. All  things pass by and are swallowed up in a moment of time. Experiences  crowd upon us; the events of our life occur, are recorded by our busy  brains, are digested, and are forgotten before the substance of which  they were made has resolved into its elements. We race through the  years, and our progress is headlong through the days.    Everything, as it is done with, is swept up into the basket of the past,  and the busy handmaids, unless we check them, toss the contents, good  and bad, on to the great rubbish heap of the world's waste. Loves,  hates, gains, losses, all things upon which we do not lay fierce and  strong hands, are gathered into nothingness, and, with a few exceptions,  are utterly forgotten.    And we, too, will soon have passed, and our little brains which have  forgotten so much will be forgotten. We shall be throttled out of the  world and pressed by the clumsy hands of Death into the mould of that  same rubbish-hill of oblivion, unless there be a stronger hand to save  us. We shall be cast aside, and left behind by the hurrying crowd,  unless there be those who will see to it that our soul, like that of  John Brown, goes marching along. There is only one human force stronger  than death, and that force is History, By it the dead are made to live  again: history is the salvation of the mortal man as religion is the  salvation of his immortal life.    Sometimes, then, in our race from day to day it is necessary to stop the  headlong progress of experience, and, for an hour, to look back upon the  past. Often, before we remember to direct our mind to it, that past is  already blurred, and dim. The picture is out of focus, and turning from  it in sorrow instantly the flight of our time begins again. This should  not be. \"There is,\" says Emerson, \"a relationship between the hours of  our life and the centuries of time.\" Let us give history and archaeology  its due attention; for thus not only shall we be rendering a service to  all the dead, not only shall we be giving a reason and a usefulness to  their lives, but we shall also lend to our own thought a balance which  in no otherwise can be obtained, we shall adjust ourselves to the true  movement of the world, and, above all, we shall learn how best to serve  that nation to which it is our inestimable privilege to belong.                                       CHAPTER II.                            THE EGYPTIAN EMPIRE.      \"History,\" says Sir J. Seeley, \"lies before science as a mass of  materials out of which a political doctrine can be deduced.... Politics  are vulgar when they are not liberalised by history, and history fades  into mere literature when it loses sight of its relation to practical  politics.... Politics and history are only different aspects of the same  study.\"[1]        [Footnote 1: 'The Expansion of England.']    These words, spoken by a great historian, form the keynote of a book  which has run into nearly twenty editions; and they may therefore be  regarded as having some weight. Yet what historian of old Egyptian  affairs concerns himself with the present welfare and future prospects  of the country, or how many statesmen in Egypt give close attention to a  study of the past? To the former the Egypt of modern times offers no  scope for his erudition, and gives him no opportunity of making  \"discoveries,\" which is all he cares about. To the latter, Egyptology  appears to be but a pleasant amusement, the main value of which is the  finding of pretty scarabs suitable for the necklaces of one's lady  friends. Neither the one nor the other would for a moment admit that  Egyptology and Egyptian politics \"are only different aspects of the same  study.\" And yet there can be no doubt that they are.    It will be argued that the historian of ancient Egypt deals with a  period so extremely remote that it can have no bearing upon the  conditions of modern times, when the inhabitants of Egypt have altered  their language, religion, and customs, and the Mediterranean has ceased  to be the active centre of the civilised world. But it is to be  remembered that the study of Egyptology carries one down to the  Muhammedan invasion without much straining of the term, and merges then  into the study of the Arabic period at so many points that no real  termination can be given to the science; while the fact of the  remoteness of its beginnings but serves to give it a greater value,  since the vista before the eyes is wider.    It is my object in this chapter to show that the ancient history of  Egypt has a real bearing on certain aspects of the polemics of the  country. I need not again touch upon the matters which were referred to  on page 8 in order to demonstrate this fact. I will take but one  subject--namely, that of Egypt's foreign relations and her wars in other  lands. It will be best, for this purpose, to show first of all that the  ancient and modern Egyptians are one and the same people; and,  secondly, that the political conditions, broadly speaking, are much the  same now as they have been throughout history.    Professor Elliot Smith, F.R.S., has shown clearly enough, from the study  of bones of all ages, that the ancient and modern inhabitants of the  Nile Valley are precisely the same people anthropologically; and this  fact at once sets the matter upon an unique footing: for, with the  possible exception of China, there is no nation in the world which can  be proved thus to have retained its type for so long a period. This one  fact makes any parallel with Greece or Rome impossible. The modern  Greeks have not much in common, anthropologically, with the ancient  Greeks, for the blood has become very mixed; the Italians are not the  same as the old Romans; the English are the result of a comparatively  recent conglomeration of types. But in Egypt the subjects of archaic  Pharaohs, it seems certain, were exactly similar to those of the modern  Khedives, and new blood has never been introduced into the nation to an  appreciable extent, not even by the Arabs. Thus, if there is any  importance in the bearing of history upon politics, we have in Egypt a  better chance of appreciating it than we have in the case of any other  country.    It is true that the language has altered, but this is not a matter of  first-rate importance. A Jew is not less typical because he speaks  German, French, or English; and the cracking of skulls in Ireland is  introduced as easily in English as it was in Erse. The old language of  the Egyptian hieroglyphs actually is not yet quite dead; for, in its  Coptic form, it is still spoken by many Christian Egyptians, who will  salute their friends in that tongue, or bid them good-morning or  good-night. Ancient Egyptian in this form is read in the Coptic  churches; and God is called upon by that same name which was given to  Amon and his colleagues. Many old Egyptian words have crept into the  Arabic language, and are now in common use in the country; while often  the old words are confused with Arabic words of similar sound. Thus, at  Abydos, the archaic fortress is now called the _Shunet es Zebib_, which  in Arabic would have the inexplicable meaning \"the store-house of  raisins\"; but in the old Egyptian language its name, of similar sound,  meant \"the fortress of the Ibis-jars,\" several of these sacred birds  having been buried there in jars, after the place had been disused as a  military stronghold. A large number of Egyptian towns still bear their  hieroglyphical names: Aswan, (Kom) Ombo, Edfu, Esneh, Keft, Kus, Keneh,  Dendereh, for example. The real origin of these being now forgotten,  some of them have been given false Arabic derivations, and stories have  been invented to account for the peculiar significance of the words thus  introduced. The word _Silsileh_ in Arabic means \"a chain,\" and a place  in Upper Egypt which bears that name is now said to be so called  because a certain king here stretched a chain across the river to  interrupt the shipping; but in reality the name is derived from a  mispronounced hieroglyphical word"]]]
