The latter, if you are  wise, you spread where the wind of the ship's going will be full upon  you. It is a strong wind and blows upon you heavily, so that the sleeves  and legs of your pyjamas flop, but it is a soft, warm wind, and beats  you as with muffled fingers. In no temperate clime can you ever enjoy  this peculiar effect of a strong breeze on your naked skin without even  the faintest surface chilly sensation. So habituated has one become to  feeling cooler in a draught that the absence of chill lends the night an  unaccustomedness, the more weird in that it is unanalyzed, so that one  feels definitely that one is in a strange, far country. This is  intensified by the fact that in these latitudes the moon, the great,  glorious, calm tropical moon, is directly overhead--follows the centre  line of the zenith--instead of being, as with us in our temperate zone,  always more or less declined to the horizon. This, too, lends the night  an exotic quality, the more effective in that at first the reason for it  is not apprehended.    A night in the tropics is always more or less broken. One awakens, and  sleeps again. Motionless white-clad figures, cigarettes glowing, are  lounging against the rail looking out over a molten sea. The moonlight  lies in patterns across the deck, shivering slightly under the throb of  the engines, or occasionally swaying slowly forward or slowly back as  the ship's course changes, but otherwise motionless, for here the sea is  always calm. You raise your head, look about, sprawl in a new position  on your mattress, fall asleep. On one of these occasions you find  unexpectedly that the velvet-gray night has become steel-gray dawn, and  that the kindly old quartermaster is bending over you. Sleepily, very  sleepily, you stagger to your feet and collapse into the nearest chair.  Then to the swish of water, as the sailors sluice the decks all around  and under you, you fall into a really deep sleep.    At six o'clock this is broken by chota-hazri, another tropical  institution, consisting merely of clear tea and biscuits. I never could  get to care for it, but nowhere in the tropics could I head it off. No  matter how tired I was or how dead sleepy, I had to receive that  confounded chota-hazri. Throwing things at the native who brought it did  no good at all. He merely dodged. Admonition did no good, nor  prohibition in strong terms. I was but one white man of the whole white  race; and I had no right to possess idiosyncrasies running counter to  dastur, the custom. However, as the early hours are profitable hours in  the tropics, it did not drive me to homicide.    The ship's company now developed. Our two prize members, fortunately for  us, sat at our table. The first was the Swedish professor  aforementioned. He was large, benign, paternal, broad in mind,  thoroughly human and beloved, and yet profoundly erudite. He was our  iconoclast in the way of food; for he performed small but illuminating  dissections on his plate, and announced triumphantly results that were  not a bit in accordance with the menu. A single bone was sufficient to  take the pretension out of any fish. Our other particular friend was C.,  with whom later we travelled in the interior of Africa. C. is a very  celebrated hunter and explorer, an old Africander, his face seamed and  tanned by many years in a hard climate. For several days we did not  recognize him, although he sat fairly alongside, but put him down as a  shy man, and let it go at that. He never stayed for the long _table  d'hote_ dinners, but fell upon the first solid course and made a  complete meal from that. When he had quite finished eating all he  could, he drank all he could; then he departed from the table, and took  up a remote and inaccessible position in the corner of the smoking-room.  He was engaged in growing the beard he customarily wore in the jungle--a  most fierce outstanding Mohammedan-looking beard that terrified the  intrusive into submission. And yet Bwana C. possesses the kindest blue  eyes in the world, full of quiet patience, great understanding, and  infinite gentleness. His manner was abrupt and uncompromising, but he  would do anything in the world for one who stood in need of him. From  women he fled; yet Billy won him with infinite patience, and in the  event they became the closest of friends. Withal he possessed a pair of  the most powerful shoulders I have ever seen on a man of his frame; and  in the depths of his mild blue eyes flickered a flame of resolution that  I could well imagine flaring up to something formidable. Slow to make  friends, but staunch and loyal; gentle and forbearing, but fierce and  implacable in action; at once loved and most terribly feared; shy as a  wild animal, but straightforward and undeviating in his human relations;  most remarkably quiet and unassuming, but with tremendous vital force in  his deep eyes and forward-thrust jaw; informed with the widest and most  understanding humanity, but unforgiving of evildoers; and with the most  direct and absolute courage, Bwana C. was to me the most interesting man  I met in Africa, and became the best of my friends.    The only other man at our table happened to be, for our sins, the young  Englishman mentioned as throwing the first coin to the old woman on the  pier at Marseilles. We will call him Brown, and, because he represents a  type, he is worth looking upon for a moment.    He was of the super-enthusiastic sort; bubbling over with vitality, in  and out of everything; bounding up at odd and languid moments. To an  extraordinary extent he was afflicted with the spiritual blindness of  his class. Quite genuinely, quite seriously, he was unconscious of the  human significance of beings and institutions belonging to a foreign  country or even to a class other than his own. His own kind he treated  as complete and understandable human creatures. All others were merely  objective. As we, to a certain extent, happened to fall in the former  category, he was as pleasant to us as possible--that is, he was pleasant  to us in his way, but had not insight enough to guess at how to be  pleasant to us in our way. But as soon as he got out of his own class,  or what he conceived to be such, he considered all people as  \"outsiders.\" He did not credit them with prejudices to rub, with  feelings to hurt, indeed hardly with ears to overhear. Provided his  subject was an \"outsider,\" he had not the slightest hesitancy in saying  exactly what he thought about any one, anywhere, always in his high  clear English voice, no matter what the time or occasion. As a natural  corollary he always rebuffed beggars and the like brutally, and was  always quite sublimely doing little things that thoroughly shocked our  sense of the other fellow's rights as a human being. In all this he did  not mean to be cruel or inconsiderate. It was just the way he was built;  and it never entered his head that \"such people\" had ears and brains.    In the rest of the ship's company were a dozen or so other Englishmen of  the upper classes, either army men on shooting trips, or youths going  out with some idea of settling in the country. They were a clean-built,  pleasant lot; good people to know anywhere, but of no unusual interest.  It was only when one went abroad into the other nations that inscribable  human interest could be found.    There was the Greek, Scutari, and his bride, a languorous rather  opulent beauty, with large dark eyes for all men, and a luxurious manner  of lying back and fanning herself. She talked, soft-voiced, in half a  dozen languages, changing from one to the other without a break in  either her fluency or her thought. Her little lithe, active husband sat  around and adored her. He was apparently a very able citizen indeed, for  he was going out to take charge of the construction work on a German  railway. To have filched so important a job from the Germans themselves  shows that he must have had ability. With them were a middle-aged  Holland couple, engaged conscientiously in travelling over the globe.  They had been everywhere--the two American hemispheres, from one Arctic  Sea to another, Siberia, China, the Malay Archipelago, this, that, and  the other odd corner of the world. Always they sat placidly side by  side, either in the saloon or on deck, smiling benignly, and conversing  in spaced, comfortable syllables with everybody who happened along. Mrs.  Breemen worked industriously on some kind of feminine gear, and  explained to all and sundry that she travelled \"to see de sceenery wid  my hoos-band.\"    Also in this group was a small wiry German doctor, who had lived for  many years in the far interior of Africa, and was now returning after  his vacation. He was a little man, bright-eyed and keen, with a clear  complexion and hard flesh, in striking and agreeable contrast to most of  his compatriots. The latter were trying to drink all the beer on the  ship; but as she had been stocked for an eighty-day voyage, of which  this was but the second week, they were not making noticeable headway.  However, they did not seem to be easily discouraged. The Herr Doktor was  most polite and attentive, but as we did not talk German nor much  Swahili, and he had neither English nor much French, we had our  difficulties. I have heard Billy in talking to him scatter fragments of  these four languages through a single sentence!    For several days we drifted down a warm flat sea. Then one morning we  came on deck to find ourselves close aboard a number of volcanic  islands. They were composed entirely of red and dark purple lava blocks,  rugged, quite without vegetation save for occasional patches of stringy  green in a gully; and uninhabited except for a lighthouse on one, and a  fishing shanty near the shores of another.

The rich brown flood adown thy sides is streaming,  With my own choice ingredients teeming;  Be this last draught, as morning now is gleaming,  Drained as a lofty pledge to greet the festal light!                  [_He puts the goblet to his lips_.    _Ringing of bells and choral song_.    _Chorus of Angels_. Christ hath arisen!    Joy to humanity!    No more shall vanity,    Death and inanity    Hold thee in prison!    _Faust_. What hum of music, what a radiant tone,  Thrills through me, from my lips the goblet stealing!  Ye murmuring bells, already make ye known  The Easter morn's first hour, with solemn pealing?  Sing you, ye choirs, e'en now, the glad, consoling song,  That once, from angel-lips, through gloom sepulchral rung,  A new immortal covenant sealing?    _Chorus of Women_. Spices we carried,    Laid them upon his breast;    Tenderly buried    Him whom we loved the best;      Cleanly to bind him    Took we the fondest care,    Ah! and we find him    Now no more there.    _Chorus of Angels_. Christ hath ascended!    Reign in benignity!    Pain and indignity,    Scorn and malignity,    _Their_ work have ended.    _Faust_. Why seek ye me in dust, forlorn,  Ye heavenly tones, with soft enchanting?  Go, greet pure-hearted men this holy morn!  Your message well I hear, but faith to me is wanting;  Wonder, its dearest child, of Faith is born.  To yonder spheres I dare no more aspire,  Whence the sweet tidings downward float;  And yet, from childhood heard, the old, familiar note  Calls back e'en now to life my warm desire.  Ah! once how sweetly fell on me the kiss  Of heavenly love in the still Sabbath stealing!  Prophetically rang the bells with solemn pealing;  A prayer was then the ecstasy of bliss;  A blessed and mysterious yearning  Drew me to roam through meadows, woods, and skies;  And, midst a thousand tear-drops burning,  I felt a world within me rise  That strain, oh, how it speaks youth's gleesome plays and feelings,  Joys of spring-festivals long past;  Remembrance holds me now, with childhood's fond appealings,  Back from the fatal step, the last.  Sound on, ye heavenly strains, that bliss restore me!  Tears gush, once more the spell of earth is o'er me    _Chorus of Disciples_. Has the grave's lowly one    Risen victorious?    Sits he, God's Holy One,    High-throned and glorious?    He, in this blest new birth,    Rapture creative knows;[9]    Ah! on the breast of earth    Taste we still nature's woes.    Left here to languish    Lone in a world like this,    Fills us with anguish    Master, thy bliss!    _Chorus of Angels_. Christ has arisen    Out of corruption's gloom.    Break from your prison,    Burst every tomb!    Livingly owning him,    Lovingly throning him,    Feasting fraternally,    Praying diurnally,    Bearing his messages,    Sharing his promises,    Find ye your master near,    Find ye him here![10]               BEFORE THE GATE.         _Pedestrians of all descriptions stroll forth_.    _Mechanics' Apprentices_. Where are you going to carouse?    _Others_. We're all going out to the Hunter's House.    _The First_. We're going, ourselves, out to the Mill-House, brothers.    _An Apprentice_. The Fountain-House I rather recommend.    _Second_. 'Tis not a pleasant road, my friend.    _The second group_. What will you do, then?    _A Third_. I go with the others.    _Fourth_. Come up to Burgdorf, there you're sure to find good cheer,  The handsomest of girls and best of beer,  And rows, too, of the very first water.    _Fifth_. You monstrous madcap, does your skin  Itch for the third time to try that inn?  I've had enough for _my_ taste in that quarter.    _Servant-girl_. No! I'm going back again to town for one.    _Others_. Under those poplars we are sure to meet him.    _First Girl_. But that for me is no great fun;  For you are always sure to get him,  He never dances with any but you.  Great good to me your luck will do!    _Others_. He's not alone, I heard him say,  The curly-head would be with him to-day.    _Scholar_. Stars! how the buxom wenches stride there!  Quick, brother! we must fasten alongside there.  Strong beer, good smart tobacco, and the waist  Of a right handsome gall, well rigg'd, now that's my taste.    _Citizen's Daughter_. Do see those fine, young fellows yonder!  'Tis, I declare, a great disgrace;  When they might have the very best, I wonder,  After these galls they needs must race!    _Second scholar_ [_to the first_].  Stop! not so fast! there come two more behind,  My eyes! but ain't they dressed up neatly?  One is my neighbor, or I'm blind;  I love the girl, she looks so sweetly.  Alone all quietly they go,  You'll find they'll take us, by and bye, in tow.    _First_. No, brother! I don't like these starched up ways.  Make haste! before the game slips through our fingers.  The hand that swings the broom o' Saturdays  On Sundays round thy neck most sweetly lingers.    _Citizen_. No, I don't like at all this new-made burgomaster!  His insolence grows daily ever faster.  No good from him the town will get!  Will things grow better with him? Never!  We're under more constraint than ever,  And pay more tax than ever yet.    _Beggar_. [_Sings_.] Good gentlemen, and you, fair ladies,      With such red cheeks and handsome dress,      Think what my melancholy trade is,      And see and pity my distress!      Help the poor harper, sisters, brothers!      Who loves to give, alone is gay.      This day, a holiday to others,      Make it for me a harvest day.    _Another citizen_.  Sundays and holidays, I like, of all things, a good prattle  Of war and fighting, and the whole array,  When back in Turkey, far away,  The peoples give each other battle.  One stands before the window, drinks his glass,  And sees the ships with flags glide slowly down the river;  Comes home at night, when out of sight they pass,  And sings with joy, \"Oh, peace forever!\"    _Third citizen_. So I say, neighbor! let them have their way,  Crack skulls and in their crazy riot  Turn all things upside down they may,  But leave us here in peace and quiet.    _Old Woman_ [_to the citizen's daughter_].  Heyday, brave prinking this! the fine young blood!  Who is not smitten that has met you?--  But not so proud! All very good!  And what you want I'll promise soon to get you.    _Citizen's Daughter_. Come, Agatha! I dread in public sight  To prattle with such hags; don't stay, O, Luddy!  'Tis true she showed me, on St. Andrew's night,  My future sweetheart in the body.    _The other_. She showed me mine, too, in a glass,  Right soldierlike, with daring comrades round him.  I look all round, I study all that pass,  But to this hour I have not found him.    _Soldiers_.  Castles with lowering             Bulwarks and towers,             Maidens with towering             Passions and powers,             Both shall be ours!             Daring the venture,             Glorious the pay!               When the brass trumpet             Summons us loudly,             Joy-ward or death-ward,             On we march proudly.             That is a storming!               Life in its splendor!             Castles and maidens             Both must surrender.             Daring the venture,             Glorious the pay.             There go the soldiers             Marching away!          FAUST _and_ WAGNER.    _Faust_. Spring's warm look has unfettered the fountains,  Brooks go tinkling with silvery feet;  Hope's bright blossoms the valley greet;  Weakly and sickly up the rough mountains  Pale old Winter has made his retreat.  Thence he launches, in sheer despite,  Sleet and hail in impotent showers,  O'er the green lawn as he takes his flight;  But the sun will suffer no white,  Everywhere waking the formative powers,  Living colors he yearns to spread;  Yet, as he finds it too early for flowers,  Gayly dressed people he takes instead.  Look from this height whereon we find us  Back to the town we have left behind us,  Where from the dark and narrow door  Forth a motley multitude pour.  They sun themselves gladly and all are gay,  They celebrate Christ's resurrection to-day.  For have not they themselves arisen?  From smoky huts and hovels and stables,  From labor's bonds and traffic's prison,  From the confinement of roofs and gables,  From many a cramping street and alley,  From churches full of the old world's night,  All have come out to the day's broad light.  See, only see! how the masses sally  Streaming and swarming through gardens and fields  How the broad stream that bathes the valley  Is everywhere cut with pleasure boats' keels,  And that last skiff, so heavily laden,  Almost to sinking, puts off in the stream;  Ribbons and jewels of youngster and maiden  From the far paths of the mountain gleam.  How it hums o'er the fields and clangs from the steeple!  This is the real heaven of the people,  Both great and little are merry and gay,  I am a man, too, I can be, to-day.    _Wagner_. With you, Sir Doctor, to go out walking  Is at all times honor and gain enough;  But to trust myself here alone would be shocking,  For I am a foe to all that is rough.  Fiddling and bowling and screams and laughter  To me are the hatefullest noises on earth;  They yell as if Satan himself were after,  And call it music and call it mirth.        [_Peasants (under the linden). Dance and song._]    The shepherd prinked him for the dance,  With jacket gay and spangle's glance,  And all his finest quiddle.  And round the linden lass and lad  They wheeled and whirled and danced like mad.  Huzza! huzza!  Huzza! Ha, ha, ha!  And tweedle-dee went the fiddle.    And in he bounded through the whirl,  And with his elbow punched a girl,  Heigh diddle, diddle!  The buxom wench she turned round quick,  \"Now that I call a scurvy trick!\"  Huzza! huzza!  Huzza! ha, ha, ha!  Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dee went the fiddle.    And petticoats and coat-tails flew  As up and down they went, and through,  Across and down the middle.  "]]]
