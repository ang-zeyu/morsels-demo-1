The incident is described in detail in a letter dated December 18,  1842, from Sleeman to his sister Mrs. Furse. Captain J. L.

The work described as follows in the printed Catalogue of Printed  Books in the British Museum appears to be a pirated edition of  _Ramaseeana_:    _The Thugs or Phansigars of India: comprising a history of the rise  and progress of that extraordinary fraternity of assassins; and a  description of the system which it pursues, &c._  Carey and Hart.

The reprint is a pamphlet  of sixteen pages. At the beginning reference is made to a previous  letter by the author on the same subject, which had been inserted in  the _Calcutta Courier_ in November, 1836.]      (5.)

On the SPIRIT OF MILITARY DISCIPLINE  in our  NATIVE INDIAN ARMY.    By Major N.[_sic_] H. Sleeman, Bengal Native Infantry.  'Europaeque saccubuit Asia.'  'The misfortune of all history is, that while the motives of a few  princes and leaders in their various projects of ambition are  detailed with accuracy, the motives which crowd their standards with  military followers are totally overlooked.'--_Malthus._   Calcutta:  Bishop's College Press.  M.DCCC.XLI.  [Thin 8vo. Introduction, pp. i-xiii; On the Spirit of Military  Discipline in the Native Army of India, pp. 1-59; page 60 blank;  Invalid Establishment, pp. 61-84. The text of these two essays is  reprinted as chapters 28 and 29 of vol. ii of _Rambles and  Recollections_ in the original edition, corresponding to Chapters 21  and 22 of the edition of 1893 and Chapters 76, 77 of this (1915)  edition. Most of the observations in the Introduction are utilized in  various places in that work. The author's remark in the Introduction  to these essays--'They may never be published, but I cannot deny  myself the gratification of printing them'--indicates that, though  printed, they were never published in their separate form. The copy  of the separately printed tract which I have seen is that in the  India Office Library. Another is in the British Museum. The pamphlet  is not in the Bodleian.]      (10.) 1841 Pamphlet.

The text was again  reprinted verbatim as Chapter 14 of vol. 2 of the _Rambles and  Recollections_ in the original edition, corresponding to Chapter 7 of  the edition of 1893, and Chapter 62 of this (1915) edition. No  contributions by the author of later date than the above to any  periodical have been traced. In a letter dated Lucknow, 12th January,  1853 (_Journey,_ vol. 2, p. 390) the author says-'I was asked by Dr.  Duff, the editor of the _Calcutta Review,_ before he went home, to  write some articles for that journal to expose the fallacies, and to  counteract the influences of this [_scil_. annexationist] school; but  I have for many years ceased to contribute to the periodical papers,  and have felt bound by my position not to write for them.']      (11.)
