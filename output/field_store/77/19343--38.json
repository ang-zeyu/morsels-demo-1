It was discovered in the year 1791, and has been since  occasionally visited by English and American whalers, and a few other  ships, for the purpose of procuring water and a supply of vegetable  productions, with which it abounds. It is situated in latitude 12 deg. 30'  south, and longitude 177 deg. east, and is distant about 260 miles from the  nearest island of the Fidji group. It is of a moderate height, densely  wooded, and abounding in cocoa-nut trees, and is about from thirty  to thirty-five miles in circumference. Its general appearance is  beautifully picturesque, verdant hills gradually rising from the sandy  beach, giving it a highly fertile appearance. It is surrounded by  extensive reefs, on which at low water the natives may be seen busily  engaged in procuring shell and other fish, which are abundantly produced  on them, and constitute one of their articles of daily food. At night,  they fish by torch-light, lighting fires on the beach, by which the fish  are attracted to the reefs. The torches are formed of the dried spathe  or fronds of the cocoa-nut tree, and enable them to see the fish, which  they take with hand-nets. It is by these lights that the fish are  attracted, but not so in the opinion of the natives, who say, \"they  come to the reef at night to eat, then sleep, and leave again in the  morning.\"    [Mr. George Bennett, in his account of his recent visit, says:--]    We made this island on the 21st of February, 1830: it bore west by  south-half-south, about twenty-five miles distant; at 11 A.M. when close  in, standing for the anchorage, we were boarded by several natives, who  came off in their canoes, and surprised us by their acquaintance with  the English language; this it seems they had acquired from their  occasional intercourse with shipping, but principally from the European  seamen, who had deserted from their ships and were residing on the  island in savage luxury and indolence. When at anchor, the extremes of  the land bore from east by north to west by compass. An island rather  high, quoin shaped, and inhabited, situated at a short distance from the  main land, (between which there is a passage for a large ship,) was at  some distance from our present anchorage, and bore west-half-north by  compass; it was named Ouer by the natives. Close to us were two rather  high islands, or islets, of small extent, planted with cocoa-nut trees,  and almost connected together by rocks, and to the main land by a reef;  they shelter the bay from easterly winds. Their bearings are as  follow:--the first centre bore east-half-north; the second centre bore  east-half-south, extreme of the main land east-south-east by compass.  One of the chiefs, on our anchoring, addressing the Commander made the  following very _humane_ observation, \"If Rotuma man steal, to make  hang up immediately.\" Had this request been complied with, there would  have been a great depopulation during our stay, and it is not improbable  that a few chiefs might have felt its effects.    On a second visit to this island in March, 1830, we anchored in a fine  picturesque bay, situated on the west side of the island, named Thor, in  fourteen fathoms, sand and coral bottom, about three miles distant from  the centre. A reef extends out some distance from the beach at this bay,  almost dry at low water, and with much surf at the entrance, from which  cause the procuring of wood and water is attended with more difficulty  than at Onhaf Bay.    On landing, the beautiful appearance of the island was rather increased  than diminished; vegetation appeared most luxuriant, and the trees and  shrubs blooming with various tints, spread a gaiety around; the clean  and neat native houses were intermingled with the waving plumes of the  cocoa-nut, the broad spreading plantain, and other trees peculiar to  tropical climes. That magnificent tree the callophyllum inophyllum, or  fifau of the natives, was not less abundant, displaying its shining,  dark, green foliage, contrasted by beautiful clusters of white flowers  teeming with fragrance. This tree seemed a favourite with the natives,  on account of its shade, fragrance, and ornamental appearance of the  flowers. When I extended my rambles more inland, through narrow and  sometimes rugged pathways, the luxuriance of vegetation did not  decrease, but the lofty trees, overshadowing the road, defended the  pedestrian from the effects of a fervent sun, rendering the walk under  their umbrageous covering cool and pleasant. The gay flowers of the  hibiscus tiliaceus, as well as the splendid huth or Barringtonia  speciosa, covered with its beautiful flowers, the petals of which are  white, and the edges of the stamina delicately tinged with pink, give  to the trees when in full bloom a magnificent appearance; the hibiscus  rosa-chinensis, or kowa of the natives also grows in luxuriance and  beauty. The elegant flowers of these trees, with others of more humble  and less beautiful tints, everywhere meet the eye near the paths,  occasionally varied by plantations of the ahan or taro, arum esculentum,  which, from a deficiency of irrigation, is generally of the mountain  variety. Of the sugar-cane they possess several varieties, and it is  eaten in the raw state; a small variety of yam, more commonly known by  the name of the Rotuma potato, the ule of the natives, is very abundant;  the ulu or bread-fruit, pori or plantain and the vi, (spondias dulcis,  Parkinson,) or, Brazilian plum, with numerous other kinds, sufficiently  testify the fertility of the island. Occasionally the mournful toa or  casuarina equisetifolia, planted in small clumps near the villages or  surrounding the burial-places, added beauty to the landscape.    The native houses are very neat; they are formed of poles and logs, the  roof being covered with the leaves of a species of sagus palm, named  hoat by the natives, and highly valued by them for that purpose on  account of their durability; the sides are covered with the plaited  sections of the cocoa-nut branches, which form excellent coverings.    The natives are a fine-looking and well-formed people; they are of good  dispositions, but are much addicted to thieving, which seems indeed to  be a national propensity; they are of a light copper colour, and the  men wear the hair long and stained at the extremities of a reddish  brown colour; sometimes they tie the hair in a knot behind, but the  most prevailing custom is to permit it to hang over the shoulders. The  females may be termed handsome, of fine forms, and although possessing  a modest demeanour, flocked on board in numbers on the ship's arrival.  The women before marriage have the hair cut close and covered with the  shoroi, which is burnt coral mixed with the gum of the bread-fruit tree;  this is removed after marriage and their hair is permitted to grow long,  but on the death of a chief or their parents it is cut close as a badge  of mourning. Both sexes paint themselves with a mixture of the root of  the turmeric plant (curcuma longa) and cocoa-nut oil, which frequently  changed our clothes and persons of an icteroid hue, from _our_  curiosity to mingle with them in the villages--_theirs_ to come on  board the ship.    On visiting the king, who resided at the village of Fangwot, we found  him a well-formed and handsome man, apparently about thirty years of  age; the upper part of his body was thickly covered with the Rang, or  paint of turmeric and oil, which had been recently laid on in honour  of the visit from the strangers. There was somewhat of novelty, but  little of \"regal magnificence\" in our reception. In the open air, under  the wide-spreading branches of their favourite Fifau, (Callophyllum  Inophyllum) sat his Majesty squatted on the ground, and surrounded by a  crowd of his subjects. The introduction was equally unostentatious; one  of the natives who had accompanied us from the ship, pointing towards  him, said, in tolerably pronounced English, \"That the king.\" His Majesty  not being himself acquainted with our language, one of his attendants,  who spoke it with considerable fluency, acted as interpreter. After some  common-place questions, such as where the ship came from, where bound  to, what provisions we stood in need of, &c., we adjourned to the royal  habitation, which differed in no respect from the other native houses.  Yams, bread-fruit, and fish, wrapped in the plantain leaves in which  they had been cooked, were here placed before us, with cocoa-nut water  for our beverage; plantain leaves serving also as plates.    The chiefs are elected kings in rotation, and the royal office is  held for six months, but by the consent of the other chiefs, it may be  retained by the same chief for two or three years. The royal title is  Sho: the king to whom we had been introduced, as a chief, is named Mora.  We had an interview also with the former king, named Riemko; he is a  chief of high rank, and a very intelligent man: he spoke the English  language with much correctness. Being naturally of an inquisitive  disposition, and possessing an exceedingly retentive memory, he had  acquired much information; this he displayed by detailing to us many  facts connected with the history of Napoleon Buonaparte, Wellington,  &c., which had been related to him by various European visiters, and  which he appeared to retain to the most minute particulars. He surprised  us by inquiring if we resided in \"Russell-square, London?\"    An innate love of roaming seems to exist among these people; they  set sail without any fixed purpose in one of their large canoes:  few ever return, some probably perish, others drift on islands either"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],[0,"Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#5)"],[1,"to sea; and he had been a sailor in his early years,  attaining the position of first officer of a large Indiaman.    The captain made him third officer at Bermuda, the better to have his  services as a detective. He had investigated Scoble's record, and  eventually found Mrs. Scoble in Cuba, where she had inherited the large  fortune of an uncle whom she had nursed in his last sickness. Scoble had  come into the possession of the wealth of a brother who had recently died  in Bermuda. He had purchased a steam-yacht of four hundred tons, in which  he had followed the Guardian-Mother, and had several times attempted to  sink her in collisions.    Officers came to Cuba to arrest him for his crimes at the races, and he was  sent to the scene of his villany, where the court sentenced him to Sing  Sing for a long term. The court in Cuba decreed that his yacht belonged to  his wife; and her new owner, at the suggestion of the commander of the  Guardian-Mother, made Penn Sharp, to whom she was largely indebted for the  fortune to which she had succeeded, the captain of her. The steam-yacht was  the Viking, and Mrs. Scoble sailed in her to New York, and then to England,  where she obtained a divorce from her recreant husband, and became the wife  of Captain Sharp, who was now in command of the Blanche, the white steamer  that sailed abreast of the Guardian-Mother when the wreck in the Arabian  Sea was discovered.    From a sailing-yacht sunk in a squall in the harbor of New York, the crew  of the steamer had saved two gentlemen. One was a celebrated physician and  surgeon, suffering from overwork, Dr. Philip Hawkes. He was induced to  accept the commander's offer of a passage around the world for his services  as the surgeon of the ship. His companion was a learned Frenchman,  afflicted in the same manner as his friend; and he became the instructor on  board.    Squire Scarburn, Louis's trustee, who was always called \"Uncle Moses,\" was  a passenger. Mrs. Belgrave had taken with her Mrs. Sarah Blossom, as a  companion. She had been Uncle Moses's housekeeper. She was a good-looking  woman of thirty-six, and one of the \"salt of the earth,\" though her  education, except on Scripture subjects, had been greatly neglected. Felix  McGavonty, the Milesian crony of Louis, had been brought up by the trustee,  and had lived in his family. The good lady wanted to be regarded as the  mother of Felix, and the young man did not fully fall in with the idea.    When Louis recovered the stolen treasure of the jockey, he had applied to  one of the principal losers by the crime, Mr. Lowell Woolridge, then  devoted to horse-racing and yachting, for advice in regard to the disposal  of the plunder. All who had lost any of the money were paid in full; and  the gentleman took a fancy to the young man who consulted him. For the  benefit of his son he discarded racing from his amusements. He invited  Louis and his mother to several excursions in his yacht; and the two  families became very intimate, though they were not of the same social  rank, for Mr. Woolridge was a millionaire and a magnate of the Fifth  Avenue.    The ex-sportsman was the father of a daughter and a son. At fifteen Miss  Blanche was remarkably beautiful, and Louis could not help recognizing the  fact. But he was then a poor boy; and his mother warned him not to get  entangled in any affair of the heart, which had never entered the head of  the subject of the warning. When the missing million came to light, she did  not repeat her warning.    After the Guardian-Mother had sailed on her voyage all-over-the-world, Miss  Blanche took a severe cold, which threatened serious consequences; and the  doctors had advised her father to take her to Orotava, in the Canary  Islands, in his yacht. The family had departed on the voyage; but  before the Blanche, as the white sailing-yacht was called, reached her  destination, she encountered a severe gale, and had a hole stove in her  planking by a mass of wreckage. Her ship's company were thoroughly  exhausted when the Guardian-Mother, bound to the same islands, discovered  her, and after almost incredible exertions, saved the yacht and the family.    The beautiful young lady entirely recovered her health during the voyage,  and Dr. Hawkes declared that she was in no danger whatever. The Blanche  proceeded with the steamer to Mogadore, on the north-west coast of Africa,  in Morocco. Here the ship was visited by a high officer of the army of  Morocco, who was the possessor of almost unbounded wealth. He was  fascinated by the beauty of Miss Blanche, and his marked attentions excited  the alarm of her father and mother, as well as of the commander. He had  promised to visit the ship again, and take the party to all the noted  places in the city.    The parents and the captain regarded such a visit as a calamity, and the  steamer made her way out of the harbor very early the next morning, towing  the yacht. The Guardian-Mother sailed for Madeira, accommodating her speed  to that of the Blanche. The party had been there only long enough to see  the sights, before the high official, Ali-Noury Pacha, in his steam-yacht  come into the harbor of Funchal.    The commander immediately beat another retreat; but the Fatime, as the  Moroccan steamer was called, followed her to Gibraltar. Here the Pacha  desired an interview with Captain Ringgold, who refused to receive him on  board, for he had learned in Funchal that his character was very bad, and  he told him so to his face. When the commander went on shore he was  attacked in the street by the Pacha and some of his followers; but the  stalwart captain knocked him with a blow of his fist in a gutter filled  with mud. Ali-Noury was fined by the court for the assault, and, thirsting  for revenge, he had followed the Guardian-Mother to Constantinople, and  through the Archipelago, seeking the vengeance his evil nature demanded. He  employed a man named Mazagan to capture Miss Blanche or Louis, or both of  them.    Captain Sharp, who was cruising in the Viking with his wife, while  at Messina found the Pacha beset by robbers, and badly wounded. The  ex-detective took him on board of his steamer, procured a surgeon, and  saved the life of the Moor, not only in beating off the robbers that beset  him, but in the care of him after he was wounded. They became strong  friends; and both the captain and Mrs. Sharp, who had been the most devoted  of nurses to him, spoke their minds to him very plainly.    The Pacha was repentant, for his vices were as contrary to the religion of  Mohammed as to that of the New Testament. Captain Sharp was confident that  his guest was thoroughly reformed, though he did not become a Christian, as  his nurse hoped he would. Then his preserver learned that the Pacha had  settled his accounts with Captain Mazagan, and sold him the Fatime.    It appeared when Captain Sharp told his story to the commander of the  Guardian-Mother at Aden, that Mazagan had been operating on his own hook in  Egypt and elsewhere to \"blackmail\" the trustee of Louis. The Pacha had  ordered a new steamer to be built for him in England; and when she arrived  at Gibraltar, he had given the command of her to Captain Sharp, to whom he  owed his life and reformation.    At Aden, Captain Ringgold discovered the white steamer, and fearing she was  the one built for the Pacha, as Mazagan had informed him in regard to her,  he paid her a visit, and found Captain Sharp in command of her. The Moor  was known as General Noury here, and he made an abject apology to the  visitor. Convinced that the Moor had really reformed his life, they were  reconciled, and General Noury was received with favor by all the party.    The Blanche was sailing in company of the Guardian-Mother for Bombay when  the wreck with several men on it was discovered. And now having reviewed  the incidents of the past, fully related in the preceding volumes of the  series, it is quite time to attend to the imperilled persons on the wreck.                                           CHAPTER IV                        FIRST AND SECOND CUTTERS TO THE RESCUE      It was still but a dim light when the commander appeared on deck. He could  not have slept more than an hour, but he was as wideawake and active as  ever before in his life. He had a spyglass in his hand, with which he  proceeded to examine the wreck as soon as he had obtained its bearings; for  he never did anything, even under such desperate circumstances as the  present, until he had first ascertained what was best to be done.    \"How long is it since you made out the wreck, Mr. Boulong?\" he inquired,  still looking through the glass.    \"Mr. Scott reported cries from that direction not ten minutes ago, and the  lookout aloft hailed the deck a minute or two later,\" replied the first  officer.    \"Make the course north by east,\" added the captain.    \"North by east, sir,\" replied Mr. Boulong, mounting the promenade, and  giving the order to the quartermaster through the window. \"Steer small till  you get the course, Bangs.\"    The captain and the third officer remained on the promenade deck, still  observing the persons on the wreck, who continued to shout and to discharge  their firearms till they saw the head of the steamer slowly turned to the  north, when they appeared to be satisfied that relief was at hand.    \"They are in a very dangerous position,\" said the commander. \"I cannot make  out what they are clinging too; but it is washed by the sea at every wave,  and they cannot hold out long in that situation. I wonder that all of them  have not been knocked off before this time.\"    \"They must have some strong hold on the thing that floats them, whatever it  is, for they are under water half the time,\" replied Scott, who was also  using a spyglass. \"I can't make out what they are on; but it looks like a  whaleback to me, with her upper works carried away.\"    \"There are no whalebacks in"]]]
