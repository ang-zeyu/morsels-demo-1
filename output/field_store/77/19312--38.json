Their logical and physical doctrines were mere outworks or  ramparts within which the ordinary life of the school was carried on. These  were useful chiefly in case of attack by the enemy; in time of peace ethics  held the supremacy. In this fact we shall find a key to unlock many  difficulties in Cicero's philosophical writings. I may instance one passage  in the beginning of the _Academica Posteriora_[95], which has given much  trouble to editors. Cicero is there charged by Varro with having deserted  the Old Academy for the New, and admits the charge. How is this to be  reconciled with his own oft-repeated statements that he never recanted the  doctrines Philo had taught him? Simply thus. Arcesilas, Carneades, and  Philo had been too busy with their polemic against Zeno and his followers,  maintained on logical grounds, to deal much with ethics. On the other hand,  in the works which Cicero had written and published before the _Academica_,  wherever he had touched philosophy, it had been on its ethical side. The  works themselves, moreover, were direct imitations of early Academic and  Peripatetic writers, who, in the rough popular view which regarded ethics  mainly or solely, really composed a single school, denoted by the phrase  \"Vetus Academia.\" General readers, therefore, who considered ethical  resemblance as of far greater moment than dialectical difference, would  naturally look upon Cicero as a supporter of their \"Vetus Academia,\" so  long as he kept clear of dialectic; when he brought dialectic to the front,  and pronounced boldly for Carneades, they would naturally regard him as a  deserter from the Old Academy to the New. This view is confirmed by the  fact that for many years before Cicero wrote, the Academic dialectic had  found no eminent expositor. So much was this the case, that when Cicero  wrote the _Academica_ he was charged with constituting himself the champion  of an exploded and discredited school[96].    Cicero's ethics, then, stand quite apart from his dialectic. In the sphere  of morals he felt the danger of the principle of doubt. Even in the _De  Legibus_ when the dialogue turns on a moral question, he begs the New  Academy, which has introduced confusion into these subjects, to be  silent[97]. Again, Antiochus, who in the dialectical dialogue is rejected,  is in the _De Legibus_ spoken of with considerable favour[98]. All ethical  systems which seemed to afford stability to moral principles had an  attraction for Cicero. He was fascinated by the Stoics almost beyond the  power of resistance. In respect of their ethical and religious ideas he  calls them \"great and famous philosophers[99],\" and he frequently speaks  with something like shame of the treatment they had received at the hands  of Arcesilas and Carneades. Once he gives expression to a fear lest they  should be the only true philosophers after all[100]. There was a kind of  magnificence about the Stoic utterances on morality, more suited to a  superhuman than a human world, which allured Cicero more than the  barrenness of the Stoic dialectic repelled him[101]. On moral questions,  therefore, we often find him going farther in the direction of Stoicism  than even his teacher Antiochus. One great question which divided the  philosophers of the time was, whether happiness was capable of degrees. The  Stoics maintained that it was not, and in a remarkable passage Cicero  agrees with them, explicitly rejecting the position of Antiochus, that a  life enriched by virtue, but unattended by other advantages, might be  happy, but could not be the happiest possible[102]. He begs the Academic  and Peripatetic schools to cease from giving an uncertain sound (balbutire)  and to allow that the happiness of the wise man would remain unimpaired  even if he were thrust into the bull of Phalaris[103]. In another place he  admits the purely Stoic doctrine that virtue is one and indivisible[104].  These opinions, however, he will not allow to be distinctively Stoic, but  appeals to Socrates as his authority for them[105]. Zeno, who is merely an  ignoble craftsman of words, stole them from the Old Academy. This is  Cicero's general feeling with regard to Zeno, and there can be no doubt  that he caught it from Antiochus who, in stealing the doctrines of Zeno,  ever stoutly maintained that Zeno had stolen them before. Cicero, however,  regarded chiefly the ethics of Zeno with this feeling, while Antiochus so  regarded chiefly the dialectic. It is just in this that the difference  between Antiochus and Cicero lies. To the former Zeno's dialectic was true  and Socratic, while the latter treated it as un-Socratic, looking upon  Socrates as the apostle of doubt[106]. On the whole Cicero was more in  accord with Stoic ethics than Antiochus. Not in all points, however: for  while Antiochus accepted without reserve the Stoic paradoxes, Cicero  hesitatingly followed them, although he conceded that they were  Socratic[107]. Again, Antiochus subscribed to the Stoic theory that all  emotion was sinful; Cicero, who was very human in his joys and sorrows,  refused it with horror[108]. It must be admitted that on some points Cicero  was inconsistent. In the _De Finibus_ he argued that the difference between  the Peripatetic and Stoic ethics was merely one of terms; in the _Tusculan  Disputations_ he held it to be real. The most Stoic in tone of all his  works are the _Tusculan Disputations_ and the _De Officiis_.    With regard to physics, I may remark at the outset that a comparatively  small importance was in Cicero's time attached to this branch of  philosophy. Its chief importance lay in the fact that ancient theology was,  as all natural theology must be, an appendage of physical science. The  religious element in Cicero's nature inclined him very strongly to  sympathize with the Stoic views about the grand universal operation of  divine power. Piety, sanctity, and moral good, were impossible in any form,  he thought, if the divine government of the universe were denied[109]. It  went to Cicero's heart that Carneades should have found it necessary to  oppose the beautiful Stoic theology, and he defends the great sceptic by  the plea that his one aim was to arouse men to the investigation of the  truth[110]. At the same time, while really following the Stoics in physics,  Cicero often believed himself to be following Aristotle. This partly arose  from the actual adoption by the late Peripatetics of many Stoic doctrines,  which they gave out as Aristotelian. The discrepancy between the spurious  and the genuine Aristotelian views passed undetected, owing to the strange  oblivion into which the most important works of Aristotle had fallen[111].  Still, Cicero contrives to correct many of the extravagances of the Stoic  physics by a study of Aristotle and Plato. For a thorough understanding of  his notions about physics, the _Timaeus_ of Plato, which he knew well and  translated, is especially important. It must not be forgotten, also, that  the Stoic physics were in the main Aristotelian, and that Cicero was well  aware of the fact.    Very few words are necessary in order to characterize Cicero's estimate of  the Peripatetic and Epicurean schools. The former was not very powerfully  represented during his lifetime. The philosophical descendants of the  author of the _Organon_ were notorious for their ignorance of logic[112],  and in ethics had approximated considerably to the Stoic teaching. While  not much influenced by the school, Cicero generally treats it tenderly for  the sake of its great past, deeming it a worthy branch of the true Socratic  family. With the Epicureans the case was different. In physics they stood  absolutely alone, their system was grossly unintellectual, and they  discarded mathematics. Their ethical doctrines excited in Cicero nothing  but loathing, dialectic they did not use, and they crowned all their errors  by a sin which the orator could never pardon, for they were completely  indifferent to every adornment and beauty of language.    III. _The aim of Cicero in writing his philosophical works_.    It is usual to charge Cicero with a want of originality as a philosopher,  and on that score to depreciate his works. The charge is true, but still  absurd, for it rests on a misconception, not merely of Cicero's purpose in  writing, but of the whole spirit of the later Greek speculation. The  conclusion drawn from the charge is also quite unwarranted. If the later  philosophy of the Greeks is of any value, Cicero's works are of equal  value, for it is only from them that we get any full or clear view of it.  Any one who attempts to reconcile the contradictions of Stobaeus, Diogenes  Laertius, Sextus Empiricus, Plutarch and other authorities, will perhaps  feel little inclination to cry out against the confusion of Ciceros ideas.  Such outcry, now so common, is due largely to the want, which I have  already noticed, of any clear exposition of the variations in doctrine  which the late Greek schools exhibited during the last two centuries before  the Christian era. But to return to the charge of want of originality. This  is a virtue which Cicero never claims. There is scarcely one of his works  (if we except the third book of the _De Officiis_), which he does not  freely confess to be taken wholly from Greek sources. Indeed at the time  when he wrote, originality would have been looked upon as a fault rather  than an excellence. For two centuries, if we omit Carneades, no one had  propounded anything substantially novel in philosophy: there had been  simply one eclectic combination after another of pre-existing tenets. It  would be hasty to conclude that the writers of these two centuries are  therefore undeserving of our study, for the spirit, if not the substance of  the doctrines had undergone a momentous change, which ultimately exercised  no unimportant influence on society and on the Christian religion itself.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14975"],[0,"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases (#5)"],[1,"lf-defense.\"    Although the race was wild over the outrage, the mockery of law and  justice which disarmed men and locked them up in jails where they could be  easily and safely reached by the mob--- the Afro-American ministers,  newspapers and leaders counselled obedience to the law which did not  protect them.    Their counsel was heeded and not a hand was uplifted to resent the  outrage; following the advice of the _Free Speech_, people left the city  in great numbers.    The dailies and associated press reports heralded these men to the country  as \"toughs,\" and \"Negro desperadoes who kept a low dive.\" This same press  service printed that the Negro who was lynched at Indianola, Miss., in  May, had outraged the sheriff's eight-year-old daughter. The girl was more  than eighteen years old, and was found by her father in this man's room,  who was a servant on the place.    Not content with misrepresenting the race, the mob-spirit was not to be  satisfied until the paper which was doing all it could to counteract this  impression was silenced. The colored people were resenting their bad  treatment in a way to make itself felt, yet gave the mob no excuse for  further murder, until the appearance of the editorial which is construed  as a reflection on the \"honor\" of the Southern white women. It is not half  so libelous as that of the _Commercial_ which appeared four days before,  and which has been given in these pages. They would have lynched the  manager of the _Free Speech_ for exercising the right of free speech if  they had found him as quickly as they would have hung a rapist, and glad  of the excuse to do so. The owners were ordered not to return, the _Free  Speech_ was suspended with as little compunction as the business of the  \"People's Grocery\" broken up and the proprietors murdered.          5 _The_ SOUTH'S POSITION      Henry W. Grady in his well-remembered speeches in New England and New York  pictured the Afro-American as incapable of self-government. Through him  and other leading men the cry of the South to the country has been \"Hands  off! Leave us to solve our problem.\" To the Afro-American the South says,  \"the white man must and will rule.\" There is little difference between the  Antebellum South and the New South.    Her white citizens are wedded to any method however revolting, any measure  however extreme, for the subjugation of the young manhood of the race.  They have cheated him out of his ballot, deprived him of civil rights or  redress therefor in the civil courts, robbed him of the fruits of his  labor, and are still murdering, burning and lynching him.    The result is a growing disregard of human life. Lynch law has spread its  insiduous influence till men in New York State, Pennsylvania and on the  free Western plains feel they can take the law in their own hands with  impunity, especially where an Afro-American is concerned. The South is  brutalized to a degree not realized by its own inhabitants, and the very  foundation of government, law and order, are imperilled.    Public sentiment has had a slight \"reaction\" though not sufficient to stop  the crusade of lawlessness and lynching. The spirit of christianity of the  great M.E. Church was aroused to the frequent and revolting crimes against  a weak people, enough to pass strong condemnatory resolutions at its  General Conference in Omaha last May. The spirit of justice of the grand  old party asserted itself sufficiently to secure a denunciation of the  wrongs, and a feeble declaration of the belief in human rights in the  Republican platform at Minneapolis, June 7. Some of the great dailies and  weeklies have swung into line declaring that lynch law must go. The  President of the United States issued a proclamation that it be not  tolerated in the territories over which he has jurisdiction. Governor  Northern and Chief Justice Bleckley of Georgia have proclaimed against it.  The citizens of Chattanooga, Tenn., have set a worthy example in that they  not only condemn lynch law, but her public men demanded a trial for Weems,  the accused rapist, and guarded him while the trial was in progress. The  trial only lasted ten minutes, and Weems chose to plead guilty and accept  twenty-one years sentence, than invite the certain death which awaited him  outside that cordon of police if he had told the truth and shown the  letters he had from the white woman in the case.    Col. A.S. Colyar, of Nashville, Tenn., is so overcome with the horrible  state of affairs that he addressed the following earnest letter to the  _Nashville American_.      Nothing since I have been a reading man has so impressed me with the    decay of manhood among the people of Tennessee as the dastardly    submission to the mob reign. We have reached the unprecedented low    level; the awful criminal depravity of substituting the mob for the    court and jury, of giving up the jail keys to the mob whenever they are    demanded. We do it in the largest cities and in the country towns; we do    it in midday; we do it after full, not to say formal, notice, and so    thoroughly and generally is it acquiesced in that the murderers have    discarded the formula of masks. They go into the town where everybody    knows them, sometimes under the gaze of the governor, in the presence of    the courts, in the presence of the sheriff and his deputies, in the    presence of the entire police force, take out the prisoner, take his    life, often with fiendish glee, and often with acts of cruelty and    barbarism which impress the reader with a degeneracy rapidly approaching    savage life. That the State is disgraced but faintly expresses the    humiliation which has settled upon the once proud people of Tennessee.    The State, in its majesty, through its organized life, for which the    people pay liberally, makes but one record, but one note, and that a    criminal falsehood, \"was hung by persons to the jury unknown.\" The    murder at Shelbyville is only a verification of what every intelligent    man knew would come, because with a mob a rumor is as good as a proof.    These efforts brought forth apologies and a short halt, but the lynching  mania was raged again through the past three months with unabated fury.    The strong arm of the law must be brought to bear upon lynchers in severe  punishment, but this cannot and will not be done unless a healthy public  sentiment demands and sustains such action.    The men and women in the South who disapprove of lynching and remain  silent on the perpetration of such outrages, are particeps criminis,  accomplices, accessories before and after the fact, equally guilty with  the actual lawbreakers who would not persist if they did not know that  neither the law nor militia would be employed against them.          6 SELF-HELP      In the creation of this healthier public sentiment, the Afro-American can  do for himself what no one else can do for him. The world looks on with  wonder that we have conceded so much and remain law-abiding under such  great outrage and provocation.    To Northern capital and Afro-American labor the South owes its  rehabilitation. If labor is withdrawn capital will not remain. The  Afro-American is thus the backbone of the South. A thorough knowledge and  judicious exercise of this power in lynching localities could many times  effect a bloodless revolution. The white man's dollar is his god, and to  stop this will be to stop outrages in many localities.    The Afro-Americans of Memphis denounced the lynching of three of their  best citizens, and urged and waited for the authorities to act in the  matter and bring the lynchers to justice. No attempt was made to do so,  and the black men left the city by thousands, bringing about great  stagnation in every branch of business. Those who remained so injured the  business of the street car company by staying off the cars, that the  superintendent, manager and treasurer called personally on the editor of  the _Free Speech_, asked them to urge our people to give them their  patronage again. Other business men became alarmed over the situation and  the _Free Speech_ was run away that the colored people might be more  easily controlled. A meeting of white citizens in June, three months after  the lynching, passed resolutions for the first time, condemning it. _But  they did not punish the lynchers._ Every one of them was known by name,  because they had been selected to do the dirty work, by some of the very  citizens who passed these resolutions. Memphis is fast losing her black  population, who proclaim as they go that there is no protection for the  life and property of any Afro-American citizen in Memphis who is not a  slave.    The Afro-American citizens of Kentucky, whose intellectual and financial  improvement has been phenomenal, have never had a separate car law until  now. Delegations and petitions poured into the Legislature against it, yet  the bill passed and the Jim Crow Car of Kentucky is a legalized  institution. Will the great mass of Negroes continue to patronize the  railroad? A special from Covington, Ky., says:    Covington, June 13.--The railroads of the State are beginning to feel very  markedly, the effects of the separate coach bill recently passed by the  Legislature. No class of people in the State have so many and so largely  attended excursions as the blacks. All these have been abandoned, and  regular travel is reduced to a minimum. A competent authority says the  loss to the various roads will reach $1,000,000 this year.    A call to a State Conference in Lexington, Ky., last June had delegates  from every county in the State. Those delegates, the ministers, teachers,  heads of secret and others orders, and the head of every family should  pass the word around for every member of the race in Kentucky to stay oil  railroads unless obliged to ride. If they did so, and their advice was  followed persistently the convention would"]]]
