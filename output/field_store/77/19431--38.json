What  Christian missionary takes a negress to wife or sits with the negro  wholly as an equal at meat? Their relations remain at best those of  teacher with taught, master with servant, grown man with child. The  Mohammedan missionary from Morocco meanwhile stands on a different  footing. He says to the negro, \"Come up and sit beside me. Give me your  daughter and take mine. All who pronounce the formula of Islam are equal  in this world and in the next.\" In becoming a Mussulman even a slave  acquires immediate dignity and the right to despise all men, whatever  their colour, who are not as himself. This is a bribe in the hand of the  preacher of the Koran, and one which has never appealed in vain to the  enslaved races of the world.[5] Central Africa then may be counted on as  the inheritance of Islam at no very distant day. It is already said to  count ten millions of Moslems.    The _Shafite_ school, the third of the four \"orthodox sects,\" is the  most flourishing of all in point of numbers, and it has characteristics  which mark it out as the one best adapted to survive in the struggle  which is impending between the schools of religious thought in Islam.  The Shafites may be compared to our broad Church, though without its  immediate tendency to infidelity. With the Shafites there is a  disposition to widen rather than to narrow the area of theology. The  Hanefites and Malekites proclaim loudly that inquiry has been closed and  change is impossible, but the Shafites are inclined to seek a new  mujtahed who shall reconcile Islam with the modern conditions of the  world. They feel that there is something wrong in things as they are,  for Islam is no longer politically prosperous, and they would see it  united once more and reorganized even at the expense of some dogmatic  concessions. I know that many even of the Shafites themselves will deny  this, for no Mussulman will willingly acknowledge that he is an advocate  of change; but it is unquestionable that among members of their school  such ideas are more frequently found than with the others.    Among the Shafites, too, ideas of a moral reformation find a footing,  and they speak more openly than the rest their suspicion that the house  of Othman, with its fornications and its bestialities and contempt of  justice, has been the ruin of Islam. Arabian custom is the basis of its  ideas upon this head, for most Arabs out of Africa if anything are  Shafites; and it is the school of the virtuous poor rather than of the  licentious rich. It is more humane in its bearing towards Jews and  Christians, finding a common ground with them in the worship of the one  true God, the moral law propounded at various times to man, and the  natural distinction between right and wrong. I may exaggerate this,  perhaps, but something of it certainly exists, and it is a feeling that  is growing.    Shafism has its stronghold at Cairo, where the Sheykh el Islam has  always belonged to this rite, but it is also the prevailing school in  Asia wherever Mohammedanism has been introduced through the  instrumentality of Arabian missionaries. In India the mass of the  Mussulman population is Shafite, especially in Hyderabad and the Bombay  Presidency, where the Arab element is strongest, while Hanefism is the  school of the great people who derive their origin from the Mogul  conquests, and of many of the Ulema who are in the habit of making their  religious education complete in the Hanefite schools of Bokhara.  Wahhabism, too, in the present century has taken great hold of the  poorer classes, and within the last few years a Turkish propaganda has  been at work among them with some success. But of this again later.    The Indian Haj is the most numerous, and represents the largest  population of all on our list, and it is besides the most wealthy. The  Indian Mussulman has less to fear from the climate of Arabia than the  native of more northern lands, and few who can afford it fail to perform  this religious duty at least once in their lives. The English Government  neither checks nor encourages the Haj, and indeed of late years has  shown a rather culpable negligence as to the interests of British  subjects on pilgrimage. Such at least is the opinion I heard constantly  given at Jeddah, and several recent incidents seem to prove that a  little closer attention to this matter would be advisable. That ugly  story which was told in our newspapers more than a year ago of the  abandonment of a pilgrim ship in the Red Sea by her British captain is,  I am sorry to say, a true one, and I heard it confirmed with every  circumstance which could aggravate the charges made. The captain in a  fit of panic left the ship without any substantial excuse, and if it had  not been for the good conduct of a young man, his nephew, who, though  ordered to leave too, refused out of humanity, there is little doubt  that the vessel would have been lost. A very painful impression was  produced on the Jeddans while I was there by the news that this English  captain had been sentenced for all punishment by an English court to two  years' suspension of his certificate. Indian pilgrims have besides been  very roughly treated in Hejaz by the authorities during the last year  because they were British subjects, and this without obtaining any  redress. Such at least is the gossip of the town. However this may be,  it seems to me astonishing that so important a matter as the Indian Haj  should be left, as it now is, entirely in the hands of chance.    The Dutch do not so leave the management of their pilgrimage from Java,  which, it will be remarked, stands second only to India on my list in  respect of numbers. Their policy is a very definite one and seems  justified by results. There is no disillusion, they argue, for a  Mussulman greater than to have visited Mecca, and they say that a  returned hajji is seldom heard to complain in Java of his lot as the  subject of a Christian power. Besides the disappointment which all  pilgrims are wont to feel who come with exalted hopes and find their  holy lands undistinguishable from the other lands of the world, the  pilgrim to Mecca certainly has to encounter a series of dangers and  annoyances which he cannot but recognize to be the result of Mussulman  misgovernment. From the moment of his landing on the holy shore he finds  himself beset with dangers. He is fleeced by the Turkish officials,  befooled by the religious touts of the towns, and sometimes robbed  openly by actual highway robbers. The religious government of the land  has no redress to offer him, and the Turkish guardians of the peace who  affect to rule are only potent in demanding fees. At every step he is  waylaid and tricked and ill-treated. He finds the Hejazi, the keepers of  the holy places and privileged ciceroni of the shrines, shrewder as men  of business than devout as believers, and he returns to his home a  sadder and, the Dutch say, a wiser man. I do not affirm that the Dutch  are right; but this is the principle they act on, and they boast of its  success.    We in India, as I have said, in our grand careless way, leave all these  things to chance. India, nevertheless, still holds the first rank in the  Haj, and, all things considered, is now the most important land where  the Mohammedan faith is found. In the day of its greatness the Mogul  Empire was second to no State in Islam, and though its political power  is in abeyance, the religion itself is by no means in decay. India has  probably a closer connection at the present moment with Mecca than any  other country, and it is looked upon by many there as the Mussulman land  of the future. Indeed, it may safely be affirmed that the course of  events in India will determine more than anything else the destiny of  Mohammedanism in the immediate future of this and the next generation.    The Malays, though holding no very high position in the commonwealth of  Islam, are important from their numbers, their commercial prosperity,  and, more than all to an European observer, from the fact that so many  of them are Dutch subjects. Holland, if any lesson for the future can  be learned in history, must in a few years find her fate linked with  that of Germany, and so too her colonies. I will not now enlarge upon  the prospect thus opened, but it is a suggestive one, and worthy of all  possible attention. For the moment the Malays stand rather apart from  other pilgrims at the shrines. They boast no great school of theology or  particular religious complexion; and as pilgrims they are held in rather  low esteem from their penurious ways. But they are a dark element in the  future, which it is equally easy to under as to over rate. Originally  converted by, and to a certain degree descended from, Arabs, they are,  as far as I could learn, followers of the Shafite teaching, and inclined  to the broad rather than the narrow ways of Islam. They number,  according to the Dutch consular agent at Jeddah, thirty million souls,  and are increasing rapidly both in Java and in the other islands of the  Malay archipelago.    Another enigma are the Chinese. I saw a few of them in the streets, and  made inquiries as to them. But I could gain no certain information. I  have heard them estimated as high as twenty millions and as low as five,  but it is certain that they are very numerous.[6] They established  themselves in China, it is said, about the second century of Islam, and  their missionaries were men of Arab race. They are found scattered in  groups all over China, but principally inland, and have full enjoyment  of their religion, being a united body which is respectable and makes  itself respected--so much so that the \"Houi-tse,\" or people of the  resurrection, as they are called, are employed in the highest offices of  the Chinese State.[7] It is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17215"],[0,"Rembrandt (#5)"],[1,"that the landscape was slight and unfinished, that  the figure in the doorway was too sketchy. Not so our enthusiast. This was  the Prodigal Son, and as for the bending, forgiving father, all that he  could imagine of forgiveness and pity was there realised in a few scratches  of the needle. He turned the prints and withdrew _Tobit Blind_. In every  line of this figure of the wandering old man, tapping his stick upon the  pavement, feeling his way by the wall, was blindness, actual blindness--all  the misery and loneliness and indignity of it.    \"Are these for sale?\" he asked the smiling proprietor, without the  slightest hope that he could afford one.    \"Oh yes! _Tobit Blind_ you can have for two shillings and sixpence.  _Abraham's Sacrifice_, _Christ at Emmaus_, and _The Prodigal Son_ are four  shillings each.\"    The enthusiast could not conceal his astonishment. \"I thought Rembrandt's  etchings cost hundreds of pounds,\" he said.    \"They do, but these are merely reproductions. Only a millionaire could hope  to possess a complete collection of first states. These are the  reproductions that were issued with M. Blanc's catalogue. He made them from  the best proofs in his own collections, and from the public museums. You  should compare them with the originals. The difference will astonish you.  It's candle-light to sunlight, satinette to the finest silk.\"    \"But where can I see the originals? I don't know any millionaires.\"    \"Nothing easier! Go to the Print Room of the British Museum or to the  Ionides Collection.\"    A day or two later the enthusiast, carrying under his arm the roll of four  Rembrandt's etchings that he had purchased for fourteen shillings and  sixpence, ascended the stairs of the British Museum, and timidly opened the  door marked, \"Print Room. Students only.\"    His reception agreeably surprised him. He, an obscure person, was treated  as if he were a M. Michel. An obliging boy requested him to hang his hat  and coat upon a peg, and to sign his name in a book. An obliging youth  waved him to a noble desk running at a right angle to a noble window, and  begged him to indicate his needs upon a slip of paper. He inscribed the  printed form with the words--\"Rembrandt's Etchings and Drawings.\"    The obliging youth scanned the document and said--\"Which do you wish to  see? There are many portfolios. I can bring you one at a time.\"    \"Do so, if you please,\" said the enthusiast. \"I should like to examine them  all, even if it takes a week.\"    The obliging youth inclined his head and departed.    There is a delightful air of leisure and learning about the Print Room, and  an entire absence of hustle. Two students besides himself were the only  other members of the public, one studying Holbein, the other Blake.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF AN OLD LADY, FULL FACE, HER HANDS FOLDED    1641. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    The first portfolio that was brought to him contained the _Christ Healing  the Sick_, known as _The Hundred Guilder Print_, in several states. It was  the first large etching by Rembrandt that he had seen, and he gazed with  astonishment, admiration, and awe at the almost miraculous characterisation  of the figures, at the depth and richness of the blacks, and the nobility  of the conception. He passed from that to _The Three Crosses_, and was even  more moved by the dramatic intensity and realism of those burdened crosses  against the profound gloom, and the dim, poignantly realised figures in the  foreground. He saw the _Christ before Pilate_ and _The Death of the  Virgin_, lingering before them, studying every detail, realising to the  full, through these splendid impressions, the height and significance of  Rembrandt's genius. He compared the four prints he had purchased with their  originals, and understood why collectors were eager to pay enormous prices  for fine states, probably printed by the master himself.    As soon as he had finished one portfolio, the watchful attendant carried it  away, and substituted another. It was so easy, so restful, and so  invigorating to study a master under these conditions, that he wondered the  public did not flock to the Print Room as to a first night at a popular  theatre.    On another day he studied the drawings and landscape etchings--that dark,  spacious design called _The Three Trees_, and a perfect little drawing of  _Joseph Consoling the Prisoners_. The large plates inspired him with  reverence and profound admiration for Rembrandt's genius as an etcher, but  it was the smaller etchings that won his love and held it. He promised  himself, when he came into certain family monies of which there was some  prospect, that instead of buying an automobile, he would make himself the  proud owner of _The Three Trees_, _The Prodigal Son_, _Abraham's  Sacrifice_, and _Tobit Blind_--perhaps one, perhaps two, perhaps three,  perhaps all four.          CHAPTER IV    EPOCHS IN REMBRANDT'S LIFE      Suppose the admiration of our enthusiast for Rembrandt had been noted in  the select suburb where he lived: suppose his mother was one of those  estimable ladies who hold monthly Dorcas meetings in their drawing-rooms:  suppose that while the ladies were working at useful garments for the poor,  she persuaded her son to discourse on Rembrandt: suppose, because the  petition came from his mother that he, very much against his will,  consented.    It was not an easy task, as he took little or no interest in the life of  Rembrandt; his interests were entirely with the aesthetic appeal of his  work. What, he asked himself, can one say about the life of a man when that  life was wholly one with his art--mingling with it, ministering to it at  every point. A boy, the fifth child of a miller living at Leyden, is born  into the world, takes to art as a duck to water, becomes one of the  greatest painters of the world, dies in obscurity, is forgotten, and long  after his death is placed among his peers. What is there to say about such  a life? He made the attempt.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF AN OLD LADY IN A VELVET HOOD, HER HANDS FOLDED    1650. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    At the age of fourteen Rembrandt entered at Leyden University, but showed  little inclination for books. He preferred Lucas van Leyden to Virgil, and  his parents, accepting the situation, allowed him to study painting under  Swanenburch, and later in the studio of Lastman at Amsterdam. After a few  months with Lastman he returned to Leyden, \"to practise painting alone and  in his own way.\" So much for his schooling. At the age of twenty-one he  produced a picture called _St. Paul in Prison_, and Gerard Dou became his  pupil. In 1631 he left Leyden and settled in Amsterdam. In 1634 he married  Saskia van Uylenborch, who bore him three children, and Titus was the  youngest. Some years later he had two daughters by his servant, Hendrickje  Stoffels. Perhaps he married her. She was a kind, good soul, faithful and  loyal to her master. His friends do not seem to have disapproved of this  irregular union, but the Consistory of her church summoned Hendrickje  before them and forbade her to communicate. At the age of fifty Rembrandt  was declared bankrupt. From that date until his death troubles encompassed  him; but he was happy so long as he could paint undisturbed. His son Titus  died when he was sixty-two, and the following year Rembrandt died, and  was buried at a cost of thirteen florins.    Our enthusiast did not find it easy to manipulate these facts, and he  elected to slur over the Hendrickje episode; but he was able to interest  the ladies of the Dorcas meeting by showing them some of Rembrandt's  pictures. He collected a series of photographs of the portraits and  paintings, including his favourite pictures, such as _The Jewish Rabbi_ in  the National Gallery, _Titus_ and _The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant_  in the Wallace collection, _Rembrandt's Mother_ and _The Singing Boy_ at  Vienna; and he invested sixpence in a little manual recently published,  called _The Masterpieces of Rembrandt_, containing sixty excellent  reproductions of his portraits and pictures.    He also displayed photographs of the remarkable series in the Hermitage  Gallery at St. Petersburg: _The Descent from the Cross_, with the brilliant  light focussed on the body and winding sheet, and fading away into the  darkness of the background; that radiant portrait of Saskia painted just  before her marriage to Rembrandt, known as _Flora with a Flower-trimmed  Crook_, standing at the opening of a grotto, with a wreath of flowers upon  her head, and the light falling upon her face and gay attire; _The Holy  Family_, the father working at his daily task in the background, and the  Virgin, who has laid down her book, drawing aside the curtain from the cot  to gaze upon the Child. He explained that Rembrandt, in placing this scene  in a humble Dutch cottage, knew that he could express the Biblical story  better that way than if he had painted an imaginary scene after the manner  of the Italians.    \"This great Dutch master\" (he quoted from Mr. Colvin) \"succeeded in making  as wonderful pictures out of spiritual abjectness and physical gloom as the  Italians out of spiritual exaltation and shadowless day.\"    [Illustration: FLORA WITH A FLOWER-TRIMMED CROOK    1634. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    At this point of his discourse he began to feel more confidence, and he  proceeded to focus his remarks upon four periods in Rembrandt's  life--epochs that lend themselves to separate treatment, each epoch marked  by the production of a masterpiece, and one remarkable portrait that has a  particular and pathetic interest. Those four pictures are _The Anatomy  Lesson_, painted in 1632, when he was twenty-six; the _Sortie of a Company  of Amsterdam Musketeers_, known as _The Night Watch_, painted in 1642, when  he was thirty-six; _The Syndics of the Cloth Hall_, painted in 1662, when  he was fifty-six"]]]
