I can discover no ground consistent with the principle on which the  franchise has been given to all men, upon which it can be denied to  women. The principal argument against such extension, so far as argument  upon that side of the question has fallen under my observation, is based  upon the position that women are represented in the government by men,  and that their rights and interests are better protected through that  indirect representation than they would be by giving them a direct voice  in the government.    The teachings of history in regard to the condition of women under the  care of these self-constituted protectors, to which I can only briefly  allude, show the value of this argument as applied to past ages; and in  demonstration of its value as applied to more recent times, even at the  risk of being tedious, I will give some examples from my own  professional experience. I do this because nothing adds more to the  efficacy of truth than the translation of the abstract into the  concrete. Withholding names, I will state the facts with fullness and  accuracy.    An educated and refined woman, who had been many years before deserted  by her drunken husband, was living in a small village of Western New  York, securing, by great economy and intense labor in fine needle work,  the means of living, and of supporting her two daughters at an academy,  the object of her life being to give them such an education as would  enable them to become teachers, and thus secure to them some degree of  independence when she could no longer provide for them. The daughters  were good scholars, and favorites in the school, so long as the mother  was able to maintain them there. A young man, the nephew and clerk of a  wealthy but miserly merchant, became acquainted with the daughters, and  was specially attentive to the older one. The uncle disapproved of the  conduct of his nephew, and failing to control it by honorable means,  resorted to the circulation of the vilest slanders against mother and  daughters. He was a man of wealth and influence. They were almost  unknown. The mother had but recently come to the village, her object  having been to secure to her daughters the educational advantages which  the academy afforded. Poverty, as well as perhaps an excusable if not  laudable pride, compelled her to live in obscurity, and consequently the  assault upon their characters fell upon her and her daughters with  crushing force. Her employment mainly ceased, her daughters were of  necessity withdrawn from school, and all were deprived of the means,  from their own exertions, of sustaining life. Had they been in fact the  harlots which the miserly scoundrel represented them to be, they would  not have been so utterly powerless to resist his assault. The mother in  her despair naturally sought legal redress. But how was it to be  obtained? By the law the wife's rights were merged in those of the  husband. She had in law no individual existence, and consequently no  action could be brought by her to redress the grievous wrong; indeed  _according to the law she had suffered no wrong_, but the husband had  suffered all, and was entitled to all the redress. Where he was the lady  did not know; she had not heard from him for many years. Her counsel,  however, ventured to bring an action in her behalf, joining the  husband's name with hers, as the law required. When the cause came to  trial the defendant made no attempt to sustain the charges which he had  made, well knowing that they were as groundless as they were cruel; but  he introduced and proved a release of the cause of action, signed by the  husband, reciting a consideration of fifty dollars paid to him. The  defendant's counsel had some difficulty in proving the execution of the  release, and was compelled to introduce as a witness, the constable who  had been employed to find the vagabond husband and obtain his signature.  His testimony disclosed the facts that he found the husband in the  forest in one of our north-eastern counties, engaged in making shingles,  (presumably stealing timber from the public lands and converting it into  the means of indulging his habits of drunkenness,) and only five dollars  of the fifty mentioned in the release had in fact been paid. The Court  held, was compelled to hold, that the party injured _in view of the  law_, had received full compensation for the wrong--and the mother and  daughters with no means of redress were left to starve. This was the act  of the _representative_ of the wife and daughters to whom we are  referred, as a better protector of their rights than they themselves  could be.    It may properly be added, that if the action had proceeded to judgment  without interference from the husband, and such amount of damages had  been recovered as a jury might have thought it proper to award, the  money would have belonged to the husband, and the wife could not  lawfully have touched a cent of it. Her attorney might, and doubtless  would have paid it to her, but he could only have done so at the peril  of being compelled to pay it again to the drunken husband if he had  demanded it.    In another case, two ladies, mother and daughter, some time prior to  1860 came from an eastern county of New York to Rochester, where a  habeas corpus was obtained for a child of the daughter, less than two  years of age. It appeared on the return of the writ, that the mother of  the child had been previously abandoned by her husband, who had gone to  a western state to reside, and his wife had returned with the child to  her mother's house, and had resided there after her desertion. The  husband had recently returned from the west, had succeeded in getting  the child into his custody, and was stopping over night with it in  Rochester on the way to his western home. No misconduct on the part of  the wife was pretended, and none on the part of the husband, excepting  that he had gone to the west leaving his wife and child behind, no cause  appearing, and had returned, and somewhat clandestinely obtained  possession of the child. The Judge, following Blackstone's views of  husband's rights, remanded the infant to the custody of the father. He  thought the law required it, and perhaps it did; but if mothers had had  a voice, either in making or in administering the law, I think the  result would have been different. The distress of the mother on being  thus separated from her child can be better imagined than described. The  separation proved a final one, as in less than a year neither father nor  mother had any child on earth to love or care for. Whether the loss to  the little one of a mother's love and watchfulness had any effect upon  the result, cannot, of course, be known.    The state of the law a short time since, in other respects, in regard to  the rights of married women, shows what kind of security had been  provided for them by their assumed representatives. Prior to 1848, all  the personal property of every woman on marriage became the absolute  property of the husband--the use of all her real estate became his  during coverture, and on the birth of a living child, it became his  during his life. He could squander it in dissipation or bestow it upon  harlots, and the wife could not touch or interfere with it. Prior to  1860, the husband could by will take the custody of his infant children  away from the surviving mother, and give it to whom he pleased--and he  could in like manner dispose of the control of the children's property,  after his death, during their minority, without the mother's consent.    In most of these respects the state of the law has undergone great  changes within the last 25 years. The property, real and personal, which  a woman possesses before marriage, and such as may be given to her  during coverture, remains her own, and is free from the control of her  husband.    If a married woman is slandered she can prosecute in her own name the  slanderer, and recover to her own use damages for the injury.    The mother now has an equal claim with the father to the custody of  their minor children, and in case of controversy on the subject, courts  may award the custody to either in their discretion.    The husband cannot now by will effectually appoint a guardian for his  infant children without the consent of the mother, if living.    These are certainly great ameliorations of the law; but how have they  been produced? Mainly as the result of the exertions of a few heroic  women, one of the foremost of whom is her who stands arraigned as a  criminal before this Court to-day. For a thousand years the absurdities  and cruelties to which I have alluded have been embedded in the common  law, and in the statute books, and men have not touched them, and would  not until the end of time, had they not been goaded to it by the  persistent efforts of the noble women to whom I have alluded.    Much has been done, but much more remains to be done by women. If they  had possessed the elective franchise, the reforms which have cost them a  quarter of a century of labor would have been accomplished in a year.  They are still subject to taxation upon their property, without any  voice as to the levying or destination of the tax; and are still subject  to laws _made by men_, which subject them to fine and imprisonment for  the same acts which men do with honor and reward--and when brought to  trial no woman is allowed a place on the bench or in the jury box, or a  voice in her behalf at the bar. They are bound to suffer the penalty of  such laws, made and administered solely by men, and to be silent under  the infliction. Give them the ballot, and, although I do not suppose  that any great revolution will be produced, or that all political evils  will be removed, (I am not a believer in political panaceas,) but if I  mistake not, valuable reforms will be introduced which are not now  thought of. Schools, almshouses, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18284"],[0,"For Every Music Lover (#5)"],[1,"tance, when a child, having no previous training in the rudiments  of music, starts with one weekly lesson, and is required to practice a  prescribed period daily without supervision. To the difficulties of an  introduction to a musical instrument are added those of learning to read  notes, to locate them, to appreciate time values and much else. The  teacher, it may be, knows little of the inner life of music, still less  of child nature. Manifold perplexities arise, and faltering through  these the pupil acquires a halting use of the musical vocabulary, with  other bad habits equally hard to correct. A constant repetition of false  notes, wrong phrasing, irregular accents, faulty rhythms and a  meaningless jumble of notes dulls the outer ear and deadens the inner  tone-sense. Where there is genius, or decided talent, no obstacle can  wholly bar the way to music. Otherwise, it retreats before the  blundering approach.    Many a mother when advised to direct her child's practicing, or at least  to encourage it by her presence, has excused herself on the plea that it  would bore her to listen. If the work bores the mother it is not  surprising that the child attacks it with mind fixed on metal more  attractive and eyes seeking the clock. Occupations which are repellent  in early life leave behind them a memory calculated to render them  forever distasteful. It is therefore a grave mistake not to make music  study from the outset throb with vital interest. An appeal to the  intellect will quicken the aesthetic instincts, be they never so slender,  and almost any one will love work that engages all the faculties.    Those pupils are fortunate who come under the influence of a teacher  with strong, well-balanced personality and ripe knowledge, and are  treated as rational beings, capable of feeling, thinking and acting. Too  many music teachers learn their business by experimenting on beginners.  It has been suggested as a safeguard against their blunders, and all  ignorance, carelessness and imposture, that music might be placed under  the same legal protection accorded other important factors in social  life, and that no one be permitted to teach it without a license granted  by a competent board of judges after the applicant had passed a  successful examination, theoretical and practical. This would be well if  there was any certainty of choosing suitable persons to select the  judges.    A practical Vienna musician, H. Geisler, has recently created no little  sensation by asserting that the pianoforte, although indispensable for  the advanced artist, is worthless, even harmful, in primary training,  and that the methods used in teaching it are based on a total  misapprehension of the musical development prescribed by nature. Sensual  and intellectual perceptions must actively exist, he feels, before they  can be expressed by means of an instrument. It is a mistake to presume  that manual practice can call them into being, or to disregard the  supremacy of the tone-sense. He considers the human voice the primitive  educational instrument of music and believes the reasonable order of  musical education to be: hearing, singing, performing.    This order is to be commended, and might readily be followed if primary  instruction was given in classes, which being less expensive than  private tuition, would admit of more frequent lessons and the services  of a competent teacher. Classes afford the best opportunity for training  the ear to accuracy in pitch, the eye to steadiness in reading notes,  the mind to comprehension of key relationships, form and rhythmic  movement, and the heart to a realization of the beauty and purport of  music. In classes the stimulating effect of healthy competition may be  felt, an impulse given to writing notes, transposing phrases and  melodies, strengthening musical sentiment and refining the taste.    Both the French Solfege method and the English Tonic Sol-fa system prove  the advantage of rudimentary training in classes. Mrs. John Spencer  Curwen, wife of the president of the London Tonic Sol-fa College, and  daughter-in-law of the late Rev. John Curwen, founder of the movement it  represents, has applied to pianoforte teaching the logical principles  underlying the system, which are those accepted by modern educators as  the psychological basis of all education. From her point of view the  music lesson may be made attractive from the moment the pupil is placed  at the instrument.    Time is taught by her as a mental science, with the pulse as the central  fact. She proceeds rhythmically rather than arithmetically, making  constant appeals to that within the child which is associated with  music. As the ear is expected to verify every fact, whether of time or  pitch, she deems essential to profitable practicing the daily  supervision of some person who understands the teacher's requirements.    Many times a child who can readily explain the relative value of every  note and dot will stumble in the time movement when confronted with a  mixture of the same notes and dots. This is because no mental  connection has been established between the mechanical time sign and its  sound, which is the outgrowth of instinctive impulses. Time confusion  may also be caused by confiding too implicitly in loud and persistent  counting, instead of trusting to the intelligently guided rhythmic  pulse.    The keenness of musical perception in the blind is a subject of frequent  comment. It is due to the fact that neither outer nor inner ear is  distracted by the organ of sight, and the mind is compelled to  concentrate itself with peculiar intensity on the tone-images aroused  for its contemplation. When one of the senses is weakened or lost, the  others become strong through the requirements made on them. This shows  how much may be gained in music study by throwing responsibility on  those faculties it is desirable to develop.    There are numerous promising schemes for class work in operation in our  own country, some of them offering excellent advantages to the student.  From the music study in our public schools valuable results ought to  come in time. Thus far, unfortunately, it is too often conducted by  teachers who are themselves without trained musical ability and who  permit their pupils to shout rather than sing music of an inferior order  to the accompaniment of a piano wretchedly out of tune.    The much beloved Phillips Brooks once said: \"A school song in the heart  of a child will do as much for his character as a fact in his memory, or  a principle in his intellect.\" Unquestionably a love for good music,  inspired during the formative period, is calculated to open unlimited  possibilities, and ours could readily be molded into a musical nation if  a firm foundation for musical knowledge and appreciation were laid in  our schools. After the rudiments were mastered, it could easily be  decided which pupils had a natural bent demanding special training.    Where music study becomes compulsory the blunder of permitting the  compulsion to be felt must be avoided. Socrates of old, in Plato's  Republic, advised making early education a sort of amusement. Those who  heed his counsel should not forget that in turning music study  altogether into play work there is danger of weakening the will. The  tottering footsteps should be guided wisely, as well as tenderly, in the  first approach to the Temple of Art, that the pupil may learn to walk,  as well as to observe and think independently. We most prize beauty that  we are able to discern for ourselves. We gain strength by intelligently  conquering our own problems and perplexities. \"Nothing is impossible,\"  as Mirabeau has said, \"for one who can will.\"    The aim of music study is to know music, to gain a correct conception of  how it should sound, and so, as far as possible, to make it sound. This  aim can never be reached by the mere cultivation of technical  adroitness. Untold sacrifices are made to-day to what becomes the  unrighteous mammon of technique when the mechanical side of practice is  exalted above its interpretative aspects. Schumann deemed brilliancy of  execution only valuable when it served a higher purpose. That higher  purpose is to reach and express the soul of music. Unless enriched by  it, all mechanism is dead. It is not desirable that every one should  perform acrobatic feats on some musical instrument, or indulge in vocal  pyrotechnics, but it is desirable to extract music out of whatever  technique may be attained. Instead of racing onward with feverish haste  to ever increased technical skill at the expense of other development,  it were well for the student to pause until each composition attacked,  be it but an exercise, could be interpreted with accuracy, intelligence,  and feeling. We should then have more musicianly players and singers. We  should more often be brought under the magic spell of exquisitely shaded  tone that may make a simple little melody alive with beauty.    [Illustration: BRAHMS]    A grave blunder of our present music study is the neglect of ensemble  playing and singing. Some of the noblest music written is for  part-singing and for two or more instruments. Much profit and delight  will be the result of making its acquaintance. Four and eight hand piano  arrangements of the great overtures and symphonies, too, are valuable  and enjoyable. They prepare the way for an appreciation of an  orchestral performance of these masterpieces, and broaden the musical  horizon. Where there are several music students in a family it is a pity  for them to confine their efforts exclusively to the piano, although  every musician should have some knowledge of this household instrument.  That is a happy home whose members are united by the playing or singing  of noble concerted music.    It is an absurd error to suppose that fine soloists cannot succeed in  ensemble work, or as accompanists. Those who fail"]]]
