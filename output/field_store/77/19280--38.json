The American Philosophical Society, founded by Franklin, and made  respectable by the labors of many eminent men, is no longer in authority,  and its proceedings command little attention. The various societies for  the cultivation of the natural sciences, in Philadelphia, Boston, and  New York, are undoubtedly accomplishing much good, but the spheres and  degrees of their influence would be greatly enlarged under a central  organization. In such a design, the initiative should be taken by men of  nerve as well as men of abilities, so that the dead weights of mediocrity  so constantly obtruding into and making ridiculous the present societies,  should be altogether excluded.    Hitherto, in this city, the most reputable and dignified association  connected with the advancement of learning, has been the Ethnological  Society. It is to be feared that with the death of Mr. Gallatin, its  president, and the dispersion of so many of its active members in the  diplomatic service, its action hereafter will deserve less consideration  than has thus far been awarded to it.      LAMARTINE'S APOLOGY FOR HIS CONFIDENCES.    Lamartine has just commenced the publication of a second part of his  Confidences, in the feuilleton of _La Presse_, and precedes it by the  following letter to the editor of that paper, which we translate for _The  International_ from _La Presse_ of July 30. It relates to the way in  which he came to publish the work, and gives a deeply interesting account  of the pecuniary embarrassments under which he had for some time been  laboring, and then eloquently defends the publication of what is real,  and glowing in private life and experience.    _To M. de Girardin:_    In addressing to you, my dear Girardin, this third volume of private  notes, to which the public have given the name of _Confidences_, I cannot  repress an emotion of pain. What I foresaw but too well has happened. I  have opened my life, and it has evaporated. This journal of my  impressions has found grace, indulgence, interest even, with some  readers, if I may judge from the anonymous friends who have written me.  But the unsparing critics, men who mingle even our tears with their ink,  in order to give more bitterness to their sarcasms, have not pardoned  those outbursts of a soul of twenty. They have believed, or have  pretended to believe, that I was seeking a miserable celebrity in the  ashes of my own heart: they have said, that by an anticipation of vanity,  I desired to gather and enjoy in advance, while yet living, the sad  Flowers which might one day grow after me upon my tomb. They have cried  out at the profanation of the inner feeling; at the effrontery of a soul  shown naked; at the scandal of recollections made public; at the venality  of sacred things; at the _simony_ of the poet selling his own fibers to  save the roof and the tree that overshadowed his cradle. I have read and  heard in silence all their malign interpretations of an act, the true  nature of which had been revealed to you long before it was to the  public. I have answered nothing. What could I say? The appearances were  against me. You alone knew that these notes had long existed, shut up in  my casket of rosewood, along with the ten volumes of the notes of my  mother; that they were intended never to be taken thence; that I rejected  the first suggestion of publishing them, with all possible warmth of  resolution; that I refused the ransom of a king for those leaves of no  real value; and that finally, one day--a day for which I reproach  myself-constrained fatally to choose between the necessity of selling my  poor _Charmettes_--_Charmettes_, as dear and more holy than the  _Charmettes_ of the _Confessions_--and the necessity of publishing these  pages, I preferred myself to suffer rather than cause suffering to good  old servants, by selling their roofs and their vines to strangers. With  one hand I received the price of the _Confidences_, and with the other I  gave it to others in order to purchase time.    Behold here all the crime that I am expiating.    And let the critics rejoice till their vengeance is satiated. This  sacrifice was in vain. It is in vain that I have cast upon the wind these  leaves, torn from the book of my most pious memories. The time that their  price procured has not proved sufficient to conduct me to the threshold  of that abode where we cease to regret anything. My _Charmettes_ have  been sold. Let them be content. I have had the shame of publishing these  _Confidences_, but not the joy of having saved my garden. Steps of  strangers will efface there the steps of my father and mother. God is  God, and sometimes he commands the wind to uproot the oak of a hundred  years, and man to uproot his own heart. The oak and the heart are his, we  must yield them to him, and yield him therewith justice, glory, and  benedictions!    And now that my acceptance of these critics is complete, and that I  confess myself guilty, and still more, afflicted--am I as guilty as they  say, and is there no excuse, which, in the eyes of indulgent and  impartial readers, can extenuate my crime?    In order to judge as to this, I have but one question to ask you, and the  public, which deigns with distracted finger to turn these pages. My  question is this:    Is it to myself, or to others, that the published pages of these  _Confidences_ can have done injury in the view of those who have read  them? Is there a single man now living, is there a single memory of one  of the dead, on whom these recollections have cast an odious or even  unfavorable light, whether on his name, his family, his life, or his  grave? Have they brought sadness to the soul of our mother in the heaven  where she resides? Has the manly face of our father been lessened in the  respect of his descendants? Has _Graziella_, that precocious and withered  flower of my early manhood, received aught beyond a few tears of young  girls shed on a tomb at Portici? Has Julia, the worship of my young  enthusiasm, lost in the imagination of those who know the name, that  purity which she has preserved in my heart? And my masters, those pious  Jesuits, whose name I love not, but whose virtue I venerate; my friends,  dearest and first harvested, Virieu Vignet, the Abbe Dumont, could they  complain, returning here below, that I have disfigured their beautiful  natures, discolored their noble images, or soiled one place in their  lives? I appeal to all who have read. Would a single shade command me to  efface a single line? Many of whom I have spoken are still living, or  their sisters, or their sons, or their friends: have I humiliated them?  They would have told me.    No! I have embalmed only pure recollections. My shroud was poor, but it  was spotless. The modest name I have wrapped there for myself will  neither be adorned nor dishonored by it. No tenderness will reproach me;  no family will accuse me of profanation in naming it. A remembrance is an  inviolable thing because it is voiceless, and must be approached with  piety. I could never console myself if I had allowed to fall from this  life into that other life, whence no one can answer, one word which could  wound those absent immortals whom we call the dead. I desire that not a  single word, thoughtfully uttered, should remain after me against one of  the men who will one day be my survivors. Posterity is not the sewer of  our passions--it is the urn of our memories, and should preserve nothing  but perfumes.    These _Confidences_ have then done injury or caused pain to no one, among  the living or among the dead. I mistake, they have done injury to me, but  to me alone. I have depicted myself such as I was: one of those natures,  alas! so common among the children of women, wrought not of one clay  only, not of that purified and exceptional substance which forms heroes,  saints, and sages, but moulded of every earth which enters into the  formation of the weak and passionate man; of lofty aspirations, and  narrow wings; of great desires, and short hands to reach whither they are  extended; sublime in ideal, vulgar in reality; with fire in the heart,  illusion in the mind, and tears in the eyes; human statues, which attest  by the diversity of the elements that compose them, the mysterious  failings of our poor nature; in which, as in the metal of Corinth, we  find after the fire the traces of all the melted metals which were  mingled and confounded in it, a little gold and much lead. But, I repeat,  whom have I injured but myself?    But they say, these unvailed exposures of sentiments and of life offend  that virginal modesty of soul, of which outward modesty is but an  imperfect emblem? You show ourself unvailed, and you do not blush! Who  then are you?    Alas! I am what you see, a poor writer; a writer, that is to say, a  thinker, in public. I am, less their genius and virtue, what were St.  Augustine, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Chateaubriand, Montaigne, all those men  Who have silently interrogated their souls and replied aloud, so that  their dialogue with themselves might also be a useful conversation with  the century in which they lived, or with the future. The human heart is  an instrument  which has neither the same number nor quality of chords in  every bosom, and on which new notes may eternally be discovered and added  to the infinite scale of sentiments and melodies in the universe. This is  our part, poets and writers in spite of ourselves, rhapsodists of the  endless poem that nature chants to men and God! Why accuse me, if you  excuse yourselves? Are we not of the same family of the _Homeridae_, who  from door to door recount histories, of which they are by turns the  historians and the heroes? Is it, then, in the nature of thought to  become a crime "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14445"],[0,"Confidences: Talks With a Young Girl Concerning Herself (#5)"],[1,"and some boys who have never been told these things and do  not understand all the things you do. Sometimes they have very wrong  ideas and will do many things that are harmful. Not only that, but they  will try to get you to do them. Some little girls who do not understand  what their organs are for will even play with them, for they think it  gives them a pleasurable sensation. I am sure they would not do this if  they understood that by so doing they were injuring the precious nest.  You know if you or anyone else would put things into your eyes or ears  or play with them in any way you might lose your sight or hearing. It is  the same way with the mother nest and other organs. The best plan is to  just keep them clean and then not touch them at any other time nor allow  anyone else to do so. But in bathing the parts you must be careful to  have your own towel and not use any cloths that have been used by other  people, for there are some dreadful diseases, called the black plagues,  that can be carried to these organs by anything that is not strictly  clean, and these diseases sometimes destroy the nest and ovules. So you  must be careful in all you do.    If at any time, Violet, questions come up in your mind as to what is the  best thing for you to do, remember that mother will be glad to answer  them or will help you obtain books that will explain things to you.  Do not go to your companions, for they might not understand and would  give you wrong ideas. In school we have text books and a teacher, who  is older and more experienced than we, to whom we can go for help in our  school problems. We know she will tell us the right solution and we know  it is better to go to her than to the other pupils. So in this study of  our bodies and the care of them, we must learn from some one older and  more experienced, or we must study books that have been written for that  purpose. Then we will be sure to obtain the right ideas.    After a while, when you are grown and it is nearing the time for you to  marry, I will tell you some things about the care of the baby and how  you may have a good-natured, healthy child. But now all you need to do  for a number of years is to take good care of this mother nest and the  rest of your body, so it will grow strong and well.           *       *       *       *       *      THE GIRL WANTED    BY    NIXON WATERMAN    Cheerful, friendly talks to young women, telling them how they can mould  their temperaments and shape their characters to sweetest and noblest  influence.
