There is no want of parts and abilities in the Spirits  of our men, but the waie to order them for publick life, and to bring  them together as stones fitly compacted to make up a perfect Palace, is  that which make's us all useless one to another; wee finde that now and  then, as it were by chance, som exquisite pieces of Learning, which som  have been hatching all their life time drop out; wherein appear's,  besides the usefulness of the Subject, or the uselesness thereof, som  inclination to bee found extraordinarie; but these endevors, disjointed  from publick Aims, advance little or nothing, the Happiness, which true  Learning rightly ordered in all the parts thereof; and Subordinate unto  Christianitie, is able to bring unto Mankind. Such pieces therefore serv  onely as a witness, to shew what wast there is of profitable time and  abilities, for want of loving combinations for publick Designs. It is  the observation of Forreigners concerning our Universities, that they  finde in them men of as great learning as any where els; but that they  lie as it were dead and unknown to the whole world of other men of  Learning; becaus they delight to live a retired and unsociable life:  this humor therefore amongst other parts of our Reformation, must by som  Gospel-principles and Rational inducements bee Reformed, not onely in  Colleges but in other Associations. The Lord teach us the waie of Truth  and Righteousness, that wee may profit in all things to advance the  glorie of his name in the Kingdom of his Son, in whom I rest    _Your friend and servant_.    J.D.          THE REFORMED LIBRARIE-KEEPER.    BY    JOHN DURIE.      _LONDON_,    Printed by _William Du-gard_,    _Anno Dom._ 1650.      THE _Reformed Librarie-Keeper_:    OR    Two copies of Letters concerning the Place and Office of a  Librarie-Keeper.      _The first Letter._    The Librarie-Keeper's place and Office, in most Countries (as most other  places and Offices both in Churches and Universities) are lookt upon, as  Places of profit and gain, and so accordingly sought after and valued in  that regard; and not in regard of the service, which is to bee don by  them unto the Common-wealth of Israel, for the advancement of Pietie and  Learning; for the most part, men look after the maintenance, and  livelihood setled upon their Places, more then upon the end and  usefulness of their emploiments; they seek themselvs and not the Publick  therein, and so they subordinate all the advantages of their places, to  purchase mainly two things thereby _viz._ an easie subsistence; and som  credit in comparison of others; nor is the last much regarded, if the  first may bee had; except it bee in cases of strife and debate, wherein  men are over-heated: for then indeed som will stand upon the point of  Honor, to the hazard of their temporal profits: but to speak in  particular of Librarie-Keepers, in most Universities that I know; nay  indeed in all, their places are but Mercenarie, and their emploiment of  little or no use further, then to look to the Books committed to their  custodie, that they may not bee lost; or embezeled by those that use  them: and this is all.    I have been informed, that in Oxford (where the most famous Librarie now  exstant amongst Protestant-Christians is kept,) the setled maintenance  of the Librarie-keeper is not above fiftie or sixtie pound _per annum_;  but that it is accidentally, _viis & modis_ somtimes worth an hundred  pound: what the accidents are, and the waies by which they com, I have  not been curious to search after; but I have thought, that if the proper  emploiments of Librarie-keepers were taken into consideration as they  are, or may bee made useful to the advancement of Learning; and were  ordered and mainteined proportionally to the ends, which ought to bee  intended thereby; they would bee of exceeding great use to all sorts of  Scholars, and have an universal influence upon all the parts of  Learning, to produce and propagate the same unto perfection. For if  Librarie-keepers did understand themselvs in the nature of their work,  and would make themselvs, as they ought to bee, useful in their places  in a publick waie; they ought to becom Agents for the advancement of  universal Learning: and to this effect I could wish, that their places  might not bee made, as everie where they are, Mercenarie, but rather  Honorarie; and that with the competent allowance of two hundred pounds a  year; som emploiments should bee put upon them further then a bare  keeping of the Books. It is true that a fair Librarie, is not onely an  ornament and credit to the place where it is; but an useful commoditie  by it self to the publick; yet in effect it is no more then a dead Bodie  as now it is constituted, in comparison of what it might bee, if it were  animated with a publick Spirit to keep and use it, and ordered as it  might bee for publick service. For if such an allowance were setled upon  the emploiment as might maintain a man of parts and generous thoughts,  then a condition might bee annexed to the bestowing of the Place; that  none should bee called thereunto but such as had approved themselvs  zealous and profitable in som publick waies of Learning to advance the  same, or that should bee bound to certain tasks to bee prosecuted  towards that end, whereof a List might bee made, and the waie to trie  their Abilities in prosecuting the same should bee described, least in  after times, unprofitable men creep into the place, to frustrate the  publick of the benefit intended by the Doners towards posteritie. The  proper charge then of the Honorarie Librarie-Keeper in a Universitie  should bee thought upon, and the end of that Imploiment, in my  conception, is to keep the publick stock of Learning, which is in Books  and Manuscripts to increas it, and to propose it to others in the waie  which may bee most useful unto all; his work then is to bee a Factor and  Trader for helps to Learning, and a Treasurer to keep them, and a  dispenser to applie them to use, or to see them well used, or at least  not abused; And to do all this, First a _Catalogue_, of the Treasurie  committed unto his charge is to bee made, that is all the Books and  Manuscripts, according to the Titles whereunto they belong, are to bee  ranked in an order most easie and obvious to bee found, which I think is  that of Sciences and Languages; when first all the Books are divided  into their _subjectam materiam_ whereof they Treat, and then everie  kinde of matter subdivided into their several Languages: And as the  Catalogue should bee so made, that it may alwaies bee augmented as the  stock doth increas; so the place in the Librarie must bee left open for  the increas of the number of Books in their proper Seats, and in the  Printed Catalogue, a Reference is to bee made to the place where the  Books are to bee found in their Shelvs or repositories. When the stock  is thus known and fitted to bee exposed to the view of the Learned  World, Then the waie of Trading with it, both at home and abroad, is to  bee laid to heart both for the increas of the stock, and for the  improvement of it to use. For the increas of the stock both at home and  abroad, correspondencie should bee held with those that are eminent in  everie Science, to Trade with them for their profit, that what they want  and wee have, they may receiv upon condition, that what they have and  wee want, they should impart in that facultie where their eminencie doth  lie; As for such as are at home eminent in anie kinde, becaus they may  com by Native right to have use of the Librarie-Treasure, they are to  bee Traded withal in another waie, _viz._ that the things which are  gained from abroad, which as yet are not made common, and put to publick  use should bee promised and imparted to them for the increas of their  private stock of knowledg, to the end that what they have peculiar, may  also bee given in for a requital, so that the particularities of gifts  at home and abroad, are to meet as in a Center in the hand of the  Librarie-keeper, and hee is to Trade with the one by the other, to caus  them to multiplie the publick stock, whereof hee is a Treasurer and  Factor.    Thus hee should Trade with those that are at home and abroad out of the  Universitie, and with those that are within the Universitie, hee should  have acquaintance to know all that are of anie parts, and how their vein  of Learning doth lie, to supplie helps unto them in their faculties from  without and from within the Nation, to put them upon the keeping of  correspondencie with men of their own strain, for the beating out of  matters not yet elaborated in Sciences; so that they may bee as his  Assistants and subordinate Factors in his Trade and in their own for  gaining of knowledg: Now becaus in all publick Agencies, it is fit that  som inspection should bee had over those that are intrusted therewith,  therefore in this Factorie and Trade for the increas of Learning, som  tie should bee upon those Librarie-keepers to oblige them to  carefulness.    I would then upon this account, have an Order made that once in the  year, the Librarie-keeper should bee bound to give an account of his  Trading, and of his Profit"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15207"],[0,"The New Physics and Its Evolution (#5)"],[1,"of quality, understood, of  course, not in the scholastic sense, since from this quality we can  argue with some precision by representing it under numerical symbols,  but still constituting an element of differentiation and of  heterogeneity.    Notwithstanding the errors they may lead to if carried to excess, both  these doctrines render, as a whole, most important service. It is no  bad thing that these contradictory tendencies should subsist, for this  variety in the conception of phenomena gives to actual science a  character of intense life and of veritable youth, capable of  impassioned efforts towards the truth. Spectators who see such moving  and varied pictures passing before them, experience the feeling that  there no longer exist systems fixed in an immobility which seems that  of death. They feel that nothing is unchangeable; that ceaseless  transformations are taking place before their eyes; and that this  continuous evolution and perpetual change are the necessary conditions  of progress.    A great number of seekers, moreover, show themselves on their own  account perfectly eclectic. They adopt, according to their needs, such  or such a manner of looking at nature, and do not hesitate to utilize  very different images when they appear to them useful and convenient.  And, without doubt, they are not wrong, since these images are only  symbols convenient for language. They allow facts to be grouped and  associated, but only present a fairly distant resemblance with the  objective reality. Hence it is not forbidden to multiply and to modify  them according to circumstances. The really essential thing is to  have, as a guide through the unknown, a map which certainly does not  claim to represent all the aspects of nature, but which, having been  drawn up according to predetermined rules, allows us to follow an  ascertained road in the eternal journey towards the truth.    Among the provisional theories which are thus willingly constructed by  scholars on their journey, like edifices hastily run up to receive an  unforeseen harvest, some still appear very bold and very singular.  Abandoning the search after mechanical models for all electrical  phenomena, certain physicists reverse, so to speak, the conditions of  the problem, and ask themselves whether, instead of giving a  mechanical interpretation to electricity, they may not, on the  contrary, give an electrical interpretation to the phenomena of matter  and motion, and thus merge mechanics itself in electricity. One thus  sees dawning afresh the eternal hope of co-ordinating all natural  phenomena in one grandiose and imposing synthesis. Whatever may be the  fate reserved for such attempts, they deserve attention in the highest  degree; and it is desirable to examine them carefully if we wish to  have an exact idea of the tendencies of modern physics.          CHAPTER II    MEASUREMENTS      Sec. 1. METROLOGY    Not so very long ago, the scholar was often content with qualitative  observations. Many phenomena were studied without much trouble being  taken to obtain actual measurements. But it is now becoming more and  more understood that to establish the relations which exist between  physical magnitudes, and to represent the variations of these  magnitudes by functions which allow us to use the power of  mathematical analysis, it is most necessary to express each magnitude  by a definite number.    Under these conditions alone can a magnitude be considered as  effectively known. \"I often say,\" Lord Kelvin has said, \"that if you  can measure that of which you are speaking and express it by a number  you know something of your subject; but if you cannot measure it nor  express it by a number, your knowledge is of a sorry kind and hardly  satisfactory. It may be the beginning of the acquaintance, but you are  hardly, in your thoughts, advanced towards science, whatever the  subject may be.\"    It has now become possible to measure exactly the elements which enter  into nearly all physical phenomena, and these measurements are taken  with ever increasing precision. Every time a chapter in science  progresses, science shows itself more exacting; it perfects its means  of investigation, it demands more and more exactitude, and one of the  most striking features of modern physics is this constant care for  strictness and clearness in experimentation.    A veritable science of measurement has thus been constituted which  extends over all parts of the domain of physics. This science has its  rules and its methods; it points out the best processes of  calculation, and teaches the method of correctly estimating errors and  taking account of them. It has perfected the processes of experiment,  co-ordinated a large number of results, and made possible the  unification of standards. It is thanks to it that the system of  measurements unanimously adopted by physicists has been formed.    At the present day we designate more peculiarly by the name of  metrology that part of the science of measurements which devotes  itself specially to the determining of the prototypes representing the  fundamental units of dimension and mass, and of the standards of the  first order which are derived from them. If all measurable quantities,  as was long thought possible, could be reduced to the magnitudes of  mechanics, metrology would thus be occupied with the essential  elements entering into all phenomena, and might legitimately claim the  highest rank in science. But even when we suppose that some magnitudes  can never be connected with mass, length, and time, it still holds a  preponderating place, and its progress finds an echo throughout the  whole domain of the natural sciences. It is therefore well, in order  to give an account of the general progress of physics, to examine at  the outset the improvements which have been effected in these  fundamental measurements, and to see what precision these improvements  have allowed us to attain.      Sec. 2. THE MEASURE OF LENGTH    To measure a length is to compare it with another length taken as  unity. Measurement is therefore a relative operation, and can only  enable us to know ratios. Did both the length to be measured and the  unit chosen happen to vary simultaneously and in the same degree, we  should perceive no change. Moreover, the unit being, by definition,  the term of comparison, and not being itself comparable with anything,  we have theoretically no means of ascertaining whether its length  varies.    If, however, we were to note that, suddenly and in the same  proportions, the distance between two points on this earth had  increased, that all the planets had moved further from each other,  that all objects around us had become larger, that we ourselves had  become taller, and that the distance travelled by light in the  duration of a vibration had become greater, we should not hesitate to  think ourselves the victims of an illusion, that in reality all these  distances had remained fixed, and that all these appearances were due  to a shortening of the rule which we had used as the standard for  measuring the lengths.    From the mathematical point of view, it may be considered that the two  hypotheses are equivalent; all has lengthened around us, or else our  standard has become less. But it is no simple question of convenience  and simplicity which leads us to reject the one supposition and to  accept the other; it is right in this case to listen to the voice of  common sense, and those physicists who have an instinctive trust in  the notion of an absolute length are perhaps not wrong. It is only by  choosing our unit from those which at all times have seemed to all men  the most invariable, that we are able in our experiments to note that  the same causes acting under identical conditions always produce the  same effects. The idea of absolute length is derived from the  principle of causality; and our choice is forced upon us by the  necessity of obeying this principle, which we cannot reject without  declaring by that very act all science to be impossible.    Similar remarks might be made with regard to the notions of absolute  time and absolute movement. They have been put in evidence and set  forth very forcibly by a learned and profound mathematician, M.  Painleve.    On the particularly clear example of the measure of length, it is  interesting to follow the evolution of the methods employed, and to  run through the history of the progress in precision from the time  that we have possessed authentic documents relating to this question.  This history has been written in a masterly way by one of the  physicists who have in our days done the most by their personal  labours to add to it glorious pages. M. Benoit, the learned Director  of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, has furnished in  various reports very complete details on the subject, from which I  here borrow the most interesting.    We know that in France the fundamental standard for measures of length  was for a long time the _Toise du Chatelet_, a kind of callipers  formed of a bar of iron which in 1668 was embedded in the outside wall  of the Chatelet, at the foot of the staircase. This bar had at its  extremities two projections with square faces, and all the _toises_ of  commerce had to fit exactly between them. Such a standard, roughly  constructed, and exposed to all the injuries of weather and time,  offered very slight guarantees either as to the permanence or the  correctness of its copies. Nothing, perhaps, can better convey an idea  of the importance of the modifications made in the methods of  experimental physics than the easy comparison between so rudimentary a  process and the actual measurements effected at the present time.    The _Toise du Chatelet_, notwithstanding its evident faults, was  employed for nearly a hundred years; in 1766 it was replaced by the  _Toise du Perou_, so called because it had"]]]
