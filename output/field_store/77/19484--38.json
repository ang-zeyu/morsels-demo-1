This  may have been due to the blossoms not being so far advanced here when  the frost touched them as farther south.    The best bearing varieties this year were the Wealthy, Charlamoff and  Duchess, in the order named. These three kinds gave us the bulk of the  crop. The Wealthy trees were not overloaded, and the apples were mostly  fine, clean and large. The Charlamoffs were bearing a heavy crop of  beautiful, large-sized apples and were ahead of the Duchess this year.  The Hibernals, too, were fairly good bearers. Most other varieties had  some fruit, but it was not perfect; it showed only too well the effect  of frost. More than half of the blossoms were destroyed. Many flowers  were badly injured and though they were setting fruit the result of  frost showed off plainly on the apples. While some had normal size and  form, many of them were below size, gnarled, cracked or undeveloped and  abnormal. Most all of them had rough blotches or rings about the calix  or around the body. Malformed apples were picked not larger than a crab,  with rough, cracked, leather-like skin, which looked more like a black  walnut than an apple.    Of plums only some young trees gave us a good crop of nice, perfect  fruit. The old trees have seen their best days and will have to give  place to the new kinds as soon as they are tested. We have quite a  variety of the new kinds on trial from the Minnesota State  Fruit-Breeding Farm and wish to say that they are very vigorous growers.  Many of them made a growth of four feet and more. We expect that some  will bear next year and we are only waiting to see what the fruit will  be before making a selection for a new plum orchard. We have already  selected No. 8 for that purpose, as one tree was bearing most beautiful  and excellent plums, of large size and superior quality, this year. They  were one and three-fourths inches long by five and one-half inches in  circumference and weighed two ounces each. They kept more than week  before they got too soft for handling and are better than many a  California plum. It seems to us if a man had ten acres of these plum  trees, he could make a fortune out of them. We will propagate only the  very best kinds for our own use and may have more to say about them  another year.    [Illustration: Cluster of Alpha grapes from Collegeville.]    Two or three of the imported pears bloomed again last spring, but the  frost was too severe and they set no fruit. We have lost all interest in  them and so, too, in our German seedling pears. The latter are now used  as stocks and are being grafted with Chinese and hybrid pears. Of those  already grafted this way some have made a growth of four and five feet.  We have been successful in grafting the six varieties of hybrid pears  obtained last spring from Prof. N.E. Hansen, of Brookings, S. Dak., and  have trees of every variety growing. These, too, are very good growers,  have fine large leaves and are promising. From the manner of growth in  stem and leaf we would judge that at least two distinct Asiatic  varieties have been used in breeding. We have gathered a little grafting  wood and next spring some more German seedlings will lose their tops. It  is only from continued efforts that success may be obtained in growing  pears in Minnesota.    Who would have thought it possible that in spite of all the frost and  cold rains we would get a pretty good crop of cherries? And yet this is  a fact. We have four varieties, and among them is one originated by the  late Clem. Schmidt, of Springfield, Minn., which was bearing a good crop  of very fine cherries while the three other sorts did not do a thing. To  get ahead of the many birds we picked the cherries a few days before  they were ripe and put them up in thirty-two half-gallon jars. As the  cherries become very soft when dead-ripe, it was of advantage to can  them when they were still hard. These canned cherries are meaty and most  delicious. We never tasted any better. It is only a pity that this  seedling cherry is not quite hardy.    As most everywhere in the state, our grapes were a complete failure. The  early growth with its good showing of fruit having been frozen in May,  it was well toward the end of June when the vines had recovered from the  shock and were able to grow vigorously again. There were a few grapes on  some of the vines, but they never got ripe. The Alpha showed the most  fruit, and a few bunches were just about getting ripe when the frost  spoiled them. This May freeze was more severe than we thought it was.  The wood of the old vines was not injured, but the one year old wood of  young plants was killed to the ground. The lesson we learned from this  is very important. It may be stated that vines full of sap and in  growing condition can endure very little cold, but when the wood is ripe  and dormant the vines will seldom be injured by sub-zero weather. This  injury to vines from frost might have been averted at least in part by  precautionary measures. In other countries people start smoldering  fires, making much smoke in the vineyard so that the whole is covered  with a cloud of smoke. This raises the temperature a few degrees and  keeps the frost out. Such preventive means might have been used here  very well to save the grapes, but it was not done.    Our currants were not very good; they ripened unevenly and showed that  they, too, were touched by frost. A few bushes were also attacked by the  currant worm.    We never cultivated any raspberries before. But last year we planted  Raspberry No. 8, sent to us from the Fruit-Breeding Farm. This sort is a  very vigorous grower; some canes grew over six feet high. It fruited  this year; it is very prolific; the fruit is very large and of good  quality. It would be quite satisfactory if it were a little hardier.  Not being protected more than half of the plants were lost last winter.    But the everbearing strawberry No. 1017 received from the Fruit-Breeding  Farm is a complete success. They were properly planted and well taken  care of. All flowers were removed up to July 10th and then left alone.  In early August the first berries were picked, and we kept right on  picking till the frost killed the fruit stalks. The growing of this  strawberry will be continued. A new bed will be planted next spring with  young plants that were not allowed to bear last season. The fruit was  all that could be desired, fine, large and of very good quality. It  seems to be of greater advantage to grow the everbearing than the  June-bearing sorts. The everbearing planted in spring will grow a large  crop in fall and bear again in June next year. From the first we get two  crops in fifteen months, from the second two crops in three years. And  to fruit any sort oftener than two seasons is not considered very  profitable.    Most all trees of apples, pears, plums, evergreens and grafts which were  planted last spring, have done very well, and we don't know of any that  failed to grow. The hybrid plums received last spring are all alive. The  same may be said of the 50 Norway pine obtained from the Minnesota State  Forester, W. F. Cox, not one failing to grow. If evergreens are handled  right in transplanting they are just as sure to grow as any other trees.  This year was especially favorable for transplanting on account of the  many rains and cool weather.    This, too, was the kind of weather which pleased our vegetable gardener.  He found it scarcely ever necessary throughout the season to apply water  to the growing plants for their best development. All grew fine and  large. Cabbage heads were grown that weighed thirty-five pounds;  carrots, onions, beets, lettuce and in fact all the different varieties  were first-class. Yet there was something that did not please the  gardener nor ourselves, namely, the tomatoes did not get ripe. We had a  few early kinds all right, but the bulk, the large, fine varieties, were  hanging on the vines still green when the first heavy frost touched  them. It was too cool for them to ripen. The same may be said of the  melons. Not once did we have melons at table this year. They were too  poor to be served.    Our floral plantings were a great success. The many artistic foliage  designs developed wonderfully and were the admiration of all visitors.  Our peonies were a mass of exceedingly beautiful flowers, filling the  air with fragrance as of roses. We are not surprised that these flowers  have gained so much popularity of late, for their great beauty and ease  of culture recommend them to all lovers of flowers. The dahlias, too,  were very excellent; in fact, we never saw them better. They are quite  ornamental in flower and plant. The newer varieties have exceptionally  large flowers, but the plants do not show off so well and bend down from  the weight of the flowers. For symmetry and uniformity of growth the old  varieties are hard to be excelled. Some of the roses were not so good as  desired, the buds got too much rain at times and rotted away. The mock  oranges, syringas and others were all very good, but the spireas  suffered much when in flower from rains. As a whole, however, our lawns  and grounds were beautiful and satisfactory and the new greenhouse has  done good work.    The growing of fruit this year has been a disappointment to many  horticulturists. Indeed, some got quite a showing of fruit in favored  localities, but the majority got not much of a crop to be proud of.  Well, we cannot regulate the weather conditions, but we are pleased with  the thought that such abnormal conditions are not of frequent occurrence  in Minnesota. Yet there is one redeeming feature of the season and that  is, the wonderful growth of plants and trees which gives promise that  with the usual normal conditions our expectations for a better fruit  crop will be realized.           *       *       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18184"],[0,"Animal Carvings from Mounds of the Mississippi Valley (#5)"],[1,"rds. The truth is that, the  question of toes aside, this carving in no wise resembles a toucan. Its  long legs and proportionally long toes, coupled with the rather long  neck and bill, indicate with certainty a wading bird of some kind, and  in default of anything that comes nearer, an ibis may be suggested;  though if intended by the sculptor as an ibis, candor compels the  statement that the ibis family has no reason to feel complimented.    The identification of this sculpture as a toucan was doubtless due less  to any resemblance it bears to that bird than to another circumstance  connected with it of a rather fanciful nature. As in the case of several  others, the bird is represented in the act of feeding, upon what it  would be difficult to say. Certainly the four etchings across the base  of the pipe bear little resemblance to the human hand. Had they been  intended for fingers they would hardly have been made to extend over the  side of the pipe, an impossible position unless the back of the hand be  uppermost. Yet it was probably just this fancied resemblance to a hand,  out of which the bird is supposed to be feeding, that led to the  suggestion of the toucan. For, say Squier and Davis, p. 266:         In those districts (_i.e._, Guiana and Brazil) the toucan was       almost the only bird the aborigines attempted to domesticate. The       fact that it is represented receiving its food from a human hand       would, under these circumstances, favor the conclusion that the       sculpture was designed to represent the toucan.    Rather a slender thread one would think upon which to hang a theory so  far-reaching in its consequences.    Nor was it necessary to go as far as Guiana and Brazil to find instances  of the domestication of wild fowl by aborigines. Among our North  American Indians it was a by no means uncommon practice to capture and  tame birds. Roger Williams, for instance, speaks of the New England  Indians keeping tame hawks about their dwellings \"to keep the little  birds from their corn.\" (Williams's Key into the Language of America,  1643, p. 220.) The Zunis and other Pueblo Indians keep, and have kept  from time immemorial, great numbers of eagles and hawks of every  obtainable species, as also turkies, for the sake of the feathers. The  Dakotas and other western tribes keep eagles for the same purpose. They  also tame crows, which are fed from the hand, as well as hawks and  magpies. A case nearer in point is a reference in Lawson to the  Congarees of North Carolina. He says, \"they are kind and affable, and  tame the cranes and storks of their savannas.\" (Lawson's History of  Carolina, p. 51.) And again (p. 53) \"these Congarees have an abundance  of storks and cranes in their savannas. They take them before they can  fly, and breed them as tame and familiar as a dung-hill fowl. They had a  tame crane at one of these cabins that was scarcely less than six feet  in height.\"    So that even if the bird, as has been assumed by many writers, be  feeding from a human hand, of which fact there is no sufficient  evidence, we are by no means on this account driven to the conclusion,  as appears to have been believed, that the sculpture could be no other  than a toucan.    As in the Cass of the manatee, it has been thought well to introduce a  correct drawing of a toucan in order to afford opportunity for  comparison of this very striking bird with its supposed representations  from the mounds. For this purpose the most northern representative of  the family has been selected as the one nearest the home of the  Mound-Builders.    The particulars wherein it differs from the supposed toucans are so many  and striking that it will be superfluous to dwell upon them in detail.  They will be obvious at a glance.    Thus we have seen that the sculptured representation of three birds,  totally dissimilar from each other, and not only not resembling the  toucan, but conveying no conceivable hint of that very marked bird,  formed the basis of Squier and Davis' speculations as to the presence of  the toucan in the mounds. These three supposed toucans have been copied  and recopied by later authors, who have accepted in full the remarks and  deductions accompanying them.    At least two exceptions to the last statement may be made. It is  refreshing to find that two writers, although apparently accepting the  other identifications by Squier and Davis, have drawn the line at the  toucan. Thus Rau, in The Archaeological Collections of the United States  National Museum, pp. 46-47, states that--         The figure (neither of the writers mentioned appear to have been       aware that there was more than one supposed toucan) is not of       sufficient distinctness to identify the original that was before       the artist's mind, and it would not be safe, therefore, to make       this specimen the subject of far-reaching speculations.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.--Keel-Billed Toucan of Southern Mexico  (_Rhamphastos carinatus_.)]    Further on he adds, \"Leaving aside the more than doubtful toucan, the  imitated animals belong, without exception, to the North American  fauna.\" Barber, also, after taking exception to the idea that the  supposed toucan carving represents a zygodactylous bird, adds in his  article on Mound Pipes, pp. 280-281 (American Naturalist for April,  1882), \"It may be asserted with a considerable degree of confidence that  no representative of an exclusively exotic fauna figured in the pipe  sculptures of the Mound-Builders.\"      PAROQUET.    The presence of a carving of the paroquet in one of the Ohio mounds has  been deemed remarkable on account of the supposed extreme southern  habitat of that bird. Thus Squier and Davis remark (\"Ancient Monuments  of the Mississippi Valley,\" p. 265, Fig. 172), \"Among the most spirited  and delicately executed specimens of ancient art found in the mounds, is  that of the paroquet here presented.\"    \"The paroquet is essentially a southern bird, and though common along  the Gulf, is of rare occurrence above the Ohio River.\" The above  language would seem to admit of no doubt as to the fact of the decided  resemblance borne by this carving to the paroquet. Yet the bird thus  positively identified as a paroquet, upon which identification have,  without doubt, been based all the conclusions that have been published  concerning the presence of that bird among the mound sculptures is not  even distantly related to the parrot family. It has the bill of a  raptorial bird, as shown by the distinct tooth, and this, in connection  with the well defined cere, not present in the paroquet, and the open  nostril, concealed by feathers in the paroquet, places its identity as  one of the hawk tribe beyond doubt.    [Illustration: Fig. 19.--Paroquet of Squier and Davis.]    In fact it closely resembles several of the carvings figured and  identified as hawks by the above authors, as comparison with figures  given below will show. The hawks always appear to have occupied a  prominent place in the interest of our North American Indians,  especially in association with totemic ideas, and the number of  sculptured representations of hawks among the mound relics would argue  for them a similar position in the minds of the Mound-Builders.    A word should be added as to the distribution of the paroquet. The  statement by Squier and Davis that the paroquet is found as far north as  the Ohio River would of itself afford an easy explanation of the manner  in which the Mound-Builders might have become acquainted with the bird,  could their acquaintance with it be proved. But the above authors appear  to have had a very incorrect idea of the region inhabited by this once  widely spread species. The present distribution, it is true, is  decidedly southern, it being almost wholly confined to limited areas  within the Gulf States. Formerly, however, it ranged much farther north,  and there is positive evidence that it occurred in New York,  Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Nebraska. Up to  1835 it was extremely abundant in Southern Illinois, and, as Mr. Ridgway  informs the writer, was found there as late as 1861. Specimens are in  the Smithsonian collection from points as far north as Chicago and  Michigan. Over much of the region indicated the exact nature of its  occurrence is not understood, whether resident or a more or less casual  visitor. But as it is known that it was found as far north as  Pennsylvania in winter it may once have ranged even farther north than  the line just indicated, and have been found in Southern Wisconsin and  Minnesota.    Occurring, as it certainly did, over most of the mound region, the  peculiar habits of the paroquet, especially its vociferous cries and  manner of associating in large flocks, must, it would seem, have made  it known to the Mound-Builders. Indeed from the ease with which it is  trapped and killed, it very probably formed an article of food among  them as it has among the whites and recent tribes of Indians. Probable,  however, as it is that the Mound-Builders were well acquainted with the  paroquet, there appears to be no evidence of the fact among their works  of art.          KNOWLEDGE OF TROPICAL ANIMALS BY MOUND-BUILDERS.      The supposed evidence of a knowledge of tropical animals possessed by  the ancient dwellers of the Mississippi Valley which has just been  discussed seems to have powerfully impressed Wilson, and in his  Prehistoric Man he devotes much space to the consideration of the  matter. His ideas on the subject will be understood from the following  quotation:        By the fidelity of the representations of so great a variety of      subjects copied from animal life, they furnish evidence of a      knowledge in the Mississippi Valley, of the fauna peculiar not only      to southern, but to tropical latitudes, extending beyond the Isthmus      into the southern continent; and suggestive either"]]]
