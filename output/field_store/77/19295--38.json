Jacob and  the Jews are prudent, loving trade, money-making, tenacious of their  ideas, living in cities; Esau and the Arabs, careless, wild, hating  cities, loving the desert.    A similar example of the maintaining of a moral type is found in the  characteristic differences between the German and Kelts, two families of  the same Indo-European race. Take an Irishman and a German, working side  by side on the Mississippi, and they present the same characteristic  differences as the Germans and Kelts described by Tacitus and Caesar. The  German loves liberty, the Kelt equality; the one hates the tyrant, the  other the aristocrat; the one is a serious thinker, the other a quick and  vivid thinker; the one is a Protestant in religion, the other a Catholic.  Ammianus Marcellinus, living in Gaul in the fourth century, describes the  Kelts thus (see whether it does not apply to the race now).    \"The Gauls,\" says he, \"are mostly tall of stature,[8] fair and red-haired,  and horrible from the fierceness of their eyes, fond of strife, and  haughtily insolent. A whole band of strangers would not endure one of  them, aided in his brawl by his powerful and blue-eyed wife, especially  when with swollen neck and gnashing teeth, poising her huge white arms,  she begins, joining kicks to blows, to put forth her fists like stones  from a catapult. Most of their voices are terrific and threatening, as  well when they are quiet as when they are angry. All ages are thought fit  for war. They are a nation very fond of wine, and invent many drinks  resembling it, and some of the poorer sort wander about with their senses  quite blunted by continual intoxication.\"    Now we find that each race, beside its special moral qualities, seems also  to have special religious qualities, which cause it to tend toward some  one kind of religion more than to another kind. These religions are the  flower of the race; they come forth from it as its best aroma. Thus we see  that Brahmanism is confined to that section or race of the great Aryan  family which has occupied India for more than thirty centuries. It belongs  to the Hindoos, to the people taking its name from the Indus, by the  tributaries of which stream it entered India from the northwest. It has  never attempted to extend itself beyond that particular variety of  mankind. Perhaps one hundred and fifty millions of men accept it as their  faith. It has been held by this race as their religion during a period  immense in the history of mankind. Its sacred books are certainly more  than three thousand years old. But during all this time it has never  communicated itself to any race of men outside of the peninsula of India.  It is thus seen to be a strictly ethnic religion, showing neither the  tendency nor the desire to become the religion of mankind.    The same thing may be said of the religion of Confucius. It belongs to  China and the Chinese. It suits their taste and genius. They have had it  as their state religion for some twenty-three hundred years, and it rules  the opinions of the rulers of opinion among three hundred millions of men.  But out of China Confucius is only a name.    So, too, of the system of Zoroaster. It was for a long period the religion  of an Aryan tribe who became the ruling people among mankind. The Persians  extended themselves through Western Asia, and conquered many nations, but  they never communicated their religion. It was strictly a national or  ethnic religion, belonging only to the Iranians and their descendants, the  Parsees.    In like manner it may be said that the religion of Egypt, of Greece, of  Scandinavia, of the Jews, of Islam, and of Buddhism are ethnic religions.  Those of Egypt and Scandinavia are strictly so. It is said, to be sure,  that the Greeks borrowed the names of their gods from Egypt, but the gods  themselves were entirely different ones. It is also true that some of the  gods of the Romans were borrowed from the Greeks, but their life was left  behind. They merely repeated by rote the Greek mythology, having no power  to invent one for themselves. But the Greek religion they never received.  For instead of its fair humanities, the Roman gods were only servants of  the state,--a higher kind of consuls, tribunes, and lictors. The real  Olympus of Rome was the Senate Chamber on the Capitoline Hill. Judaism  also was in reality an ethnic religion, though it aimed at catholicity and  expected it, and made proselytes. But it could not tolerate unessentials,  and so failed of becoming catholic. The Jewish religion, until it had  Christianity to help it, was never able to do more than make proselytes  here and there. Christianity, while preaching the doctrines of Jesus and  the New Testament, has been able to carry also the weight of the Old  Testament, and to give a certain catholicity to Judaism. The religion of  Mohammed has been catholic, in that it has become the religion of very  different races,--the Arabs, Turks, and Persians, belonging to the three  great varieties of the human family. But then Mohammedanism has never  sought to make _converts_, but only _subjects;_ it has not asked for  belief, but merely for submission. Consequently Mr. Palgrave, Mr. Lane,  and Mr. Vambery tell us, that, in Arabia, Egypt, and Turkistan, there are  multitudes who are outwardly Mohammedan, but who in their private belief  reject Mohammed, and are really Pagans. But, no doubt, there is a catholic  tendency both in Judaism and Mohammedanism; and this comes from the great  doctrine which they hold in common with Christianity,--the _unity of God_.  Faith in that is the basis of all expectation of a universal religion, and  the wish and the power to convert others come from that doctrine of the  Divine unity.           *       *       *       *       *    But Christianity teaches the unity of God not merely as a supremacy of  power and will, but as a supremacy of love and wisdom; it teaches God as  Father, and not merely as King; so it seeks not merely to make proselytes  and subjects, but to make converts. Hence Christianity, beginning as a  Semitic religion, among the Jews, went across the Greek Archipelago and  converted the Hellenic and the Latin races; afterward the Goths,  Lombards, Franks, Vandals; later still, the Saxons, Danes, and Normans.  Meantime, its Nestorian missionaries, pushing east, made converts in  Armenia, Persia, India, and China. In later days it has converted negroes,  Indians, and the people of the Pacific Islands. Something, indeed, stopped  its progress after its first triumphant successes during seven or eight  centuries. At the tenth century it reached its term. Modern missions,  whether those of Jesuits or Protestants, have not converted whole nations  and races, but only individuals here and there. The reason of this check,  probably, is, that Christians have repeated the mistakes of the Jews and  Mohammedans. They have sought to make proselytes to an outward system of  worship and ritual, or to make subjects to a _dogma_; but not to make  converts to an idea and a life. When the Christian missionaries shall go  and say to the Hindoos or the Buddhists: \"You are already on your way  toward God,--your religion came from him, and was inspired by his Spirit;  now he sends you something more and higher by his Son, who does not come  to destroy but to fulfil, not to take away any good thing you have, but to  add to it something better,\" then we shall see the process of conversion,  checked in the ninth and tenth, centuries, reinaugurated.    Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, all teaching the strict unity of God,  have all aimed at becoming universal. Judaism failed because it sought  proselytes instead of making converts. Islam, the religion of Mohammed (in  reality a Judaizing Christian sect) failed because it sought to make  subjects rather than converts. Its conquests over a variety of races were  extensive, but not deep. To-day it holds in its embrace at least four very  distinct races,--the Arabs, a Semitic race, the Persians, an Indo-European  race, the Negroes, and the Turks or Turanians. But, correctly viewed,  Islam is only a heretical Christian sect, and so all this must be credited  to the interest of Christianity. Islam is a John the Baptist crying in the  wilderness, \"Prepare the way of the Lord\"; Mohammed is a schoolmaster to  bring men to Christ. It does for the nations just what Judaism did, that  is, it teaches the Divine unity. Esau has taken the place of Jacob in the  economy of Providence. When the Jews rejected Christ they ceased from  their providential work, and their cousins, the Arabs, took their place.  The conquests of Islam, therefore, ought to be regarded as the preliminary  conquests of Christianity.    There is still another system which has shown some tendencies toward  catholicity. This is Buddhism, which has extended itself over the whole of  the eastern half of Asia. But though it includes a variety of  nationalities, it is doubtful if it includes any variety of races. All the  Buddhists appear to belong to the great Mongol family. And although this  system originated among the Aryan race in India, it has let go its hold of  that family and transferred itself wholly to the Mongols.    But Christianity, from the first, showed itself capable of taking  possession of the convictions of the most different races of mankind. Now,  as on the day of Pentecost, many races hear the apostles speak in their  own tongues, in which they were born,--Parthians, Medes, Elamites,  dwellers in Mesopotamia, Judaea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia  and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Lybia about Cyrene, strangers of  Rome, Cretes and Arabians. The miracle of tongues was a type of the effect  of the truth in penetrating the mind and heart of different nationalities.  The Jewish Christians, indeed, tried "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 1 (#5)"],[1,"of a bad king. Both were alike indignant at the favour shown by  the court to the natives of Poitou and Aquitaine. The great grandsons of  those who had fought under William and the great grandsons of those who  had fought under Harold began to draw near to each other in friendship;  and the first pledge of their reconciliation was the Great Charter, won  by their united exertions, and framed for their common benefit.    Here commences the history of the English nation. The history of the  preceding events is the history of wrongs inflicted and sustained by  various tribes, which indeed all dwelt on English ground, but which  regarded each other with aversion such as has scarcely ever existed  between communities separated by physical barriers. For even the mutual  animosity of countries at war with each other is languid when compared  with the animosity of nations which, morally separated, are yet locally  intermingled. In no country has the enmity of race been carried farther  than in England. In no country has that enmity been more completely  effaced. The stages of the process by which the hostile elements were  melted down into one homogeneous mass are not accurately known to us.  But it is certain that, when John became King, the distinction between  Saxons and Normans was strongly marked, and that before the end of the  reign of his grandson it had almost disappeared. In the time of Richard  the First, the ordinary imprecation of a Norman gentleman was \"May I  become an Englishman!\" His ordinary form of indignant denial was \"Do you  take me for an Englishman?\" The descendant of such a gentleman a hundred  years later was proud of the English name.    The sources of the noblest rivers which spread fertility over  continents, and bear richly laden fleets to the sea, are to be sought  in wild and barren mountain tracts, incorrectly laid down in maps,  and rarely explored by travellers. To such a tract the history of our  country during the thirteenth century may not unaptly be compared.  Sterile and obscure as is that portion of our annals, it is there that  we must seek for the origin of our freedom, our prosperity, and our  glory. Then it was that the great English people was formed, that the  national character began to exhibit those peculiarities which it has  ever since retained, and that our fathers became emphatically islanders,  islanders not merely in geographical position, but in their politics,  their feelings, and their manners. Then first appeared with distinctness  that constitution which has ever since, through all changes,  preserved its identity; that constitution of which all the other free  constitutions in the world are copies, and which, in spite of some  defects, deserves to be regarded as the best under which any great  society has ever yet existed during many ages. Then it was that the  House of Commons, the archetype of all the representative assemblies  which now meet, either in the old or in the new world, held its first  sittings. Then it was that the common law rose to the dignity of  a science, and rapidly became a not unworthy rival of the imperial  jurisprudence. Then it was that the courage of those sailors who manned  the rude barks of the Cinque Ports first made the flag of England  terrible on the seas. Then it was that the most ancient colleges which  still exist at both the great national seats of learning were founded.  Then was formed that language, less musical indeed than the languages  of the south, but in force, in richness, in aptitude for all the highest  purposes of the poet, the philosopher, and the orator, inferior to the  tongue of Greece alone. Then too appeared the first faint dawn of that  noble literature, the most splendid and the most durable of the many  glories of England.    Early in the fourteenth century the amalgamation of the races was  all but complete; and it was soon made manifest, by signs not to be  mistaken, that a people inferior to none existing in the world had been  formed by the mixture of three branches of the great Teutonic family  with each other, and with the aboriginal Britons. There was, indeed,  scarcely anything in common between the England to which John had been  chased by Philip Augustus, and the England from which the armies of  Edward the Third went forth to conquer France.    A period of more than a hundred years followed, during which the chief  object of the English was to establish, by force of arms, a great empire  on the Continent. The claim of Edward to the inheritance occupied by  the House of Valois was a claim in which it might seem that his subjects  were little interested. But the passion for conquest spread fast from  the prince to the people. The war differed widely from the wars  which the Plantagenets of the twelfth century had waged against the  descendants of Hugh Capet. For the success of Henry the Second, or of  Richard the First, would have made England a province of France. The  effect of the successes of Edward the Third and Henry the Fifth was to  make France, for a time, a province of England. The disdain with which,  in the twelfth century, the conquerors from the Continent had regarded  the islanders, was now retorted by the islanders on the people of the  Continent. Every yeoman from Kent to Northumberland valued himself as  one of a race born for victory and dominion, and looked down with  scorn on the nation before which his ancestors had trembled. Even those  knights of Gascony and Guienne who had fought gallantly under the Black  Prince were regarded by the English as men of an inferior breed, and  were contemptuously excluded from honourable and lucrative commands. In  no long time our ancestors altogether lost sight of the original  ground of quarrel. They began to consider the crown of France as a  mere appendage to the crown of England; and, when in violation of the  ordinary law of succession, they transferred the crown of England to the  House of Lancaster, they seem to have thought that the right of Richard  the Second to the crown of France passed, as of course, to that house.  The zeal and vigour which they displayed present a remarkable contrast  to the torpor of the French, who were far more deeply interested in  the event of the struggle. The most splendid victories recorded in the  history of the middle ages were gained at this time, against great odds,  by the English armies. Victories indeed they were of which a nation may  justly be proud; for they are to be attributed to the moral superiority  of the victors, a superiority which was most striking in the lowest  ranks. The knights of England found worthy rivals in the knights of  France. Chandos encountered an equal foe in Du Guesclin. But France had  no infantry that dared to face the English bows and bills. A French King  was brought prisoner to London. An English King was crowned at Paris.  The banner of St. George was carried far beyond the Pyrenees and the  Alps. On the south of the Ebro the English won a great battle, which for  a time decided the fate of Leon and Castile; and the English Companies  obtained a terrible preeminence among the bands of warriors who let out  their weapons for hire to the princes and commonwealths of Italy.    Nor were the arts of peace neglected by our fathers during that stirring  period. While France was wasted by war, till she at length found in  her own desolation a miserable defence against invaders, the English  gathered in their harvests, adorned their cities, pleaded, traded, and  studied in security. Many of our noblest architectural monuments belong  to that age. Then rose the fair chapels of New College and of Saint  George, the nave of Winchester and the choir of York, the spire of  Salisbury and the majestic towers of Lincoln. A copious and forcible  language, formed by an infusion of French into German, was now the  common property of the aristocracy and of the people. Nor was it long  before genius began to apply that admirable machine to worthy purposes.  While English warriors, leaving behind them the devastated provinces of  France, entered Valladolid in triumph, and spread terror to the gates of  Florence, English poets depicted in vivid tints all the wide variety  of human manners and fortunes, and English thinkers aspired to know, or  dared to doubt, where bigots had been content to wonder and to believe.  The same age which produced the Black Prince and Derby, Chandos and  Hawkwood, produced also Geoffrey Chaucer and John Wycliffe.    In so splendid and imperial a manner did the English people, properly  so called, first take place among the nations of the world. Yet while  we contemplate with pleasure the high and commanding qualities which  our forefathers displayed, we cannot but admit that the end which they  pursued was an end condemned both by humanity and by enlightened policy,  and that the reverses which compelled them, after a long and bloody  struggle, to relinquish the hope of establishing a great continental  empire, were really blessings in the guise of disasters. The spirit of  the French was at last aroused: they began to oppose a vigorous national  resistance to the foreign conquerors; and from that time the skill  of the English captains and the courage of the English soldiers were,  happily for mankind, exerted in vain. After many desperate struggles,  and with many bitter regrets, our ancestors gave up the contest. Since  that age no British government has ever seriously and steadily pursued  the design of making great conquests on the Continent. The people,  indeed, continued to cherish with pride the recollection of Cressy, of  Poitiers, and of Agincourt. Even after the lapse of many years it was  easy to fire their blood and to draw forth their subsidies by promising  them an expedition for the conquest of France. But happily the energies  of our country have been directed to better objects; and she now  occupies in the history of mankind "]]]
