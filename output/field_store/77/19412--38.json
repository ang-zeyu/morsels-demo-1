The often-quoted maxim of La Rochefoucauld, that there is something in  the misfortunes of our friends which affords us a degree of secret  pleasure, is well known to the Persians. Saadi tells us of a merchant  who, having lost a thousand dinars, cautioned his son not to mention the  matter to anyone, \"in order,\" said he, \"that we may not suffer two  misfortunes--the loss of our money and the secret satisfaction of our  neighbours.\"    A generous disposition is thus eloquently recommended: They asked a wise  man, which was preferable, fortitude or liberality, to which he replied:  \"He who possesses liberality has no need of fortitude. It is inscribed  on the tomb of Bahram-i-Gur that a liberal hand is preferable to a  strong arm.\" \"Hatim Tai,\" remarks Saadi, \"no longer exists, but his  exalted name will remain famous for virtue to eternity.[6] Distribute  the tithe of your wealth in alms, for when the husbandman lops off the  exuberant branches from the vine, it produces an increase of grapes.\"        [6] Hatim was chief of the Arabian tribe of Tai, shortly          before Muhammed began to promulgate Islam, renowned for          his extraordinary liberality.    Prodigality, however, is as much to be condemned as judicious liberality  is to be lauded. Saadi gives the following account of a Persian prodigal  son, who was not so fortunate in the end as his biblical prototype: The  son of a religious man, who succeeded to an immense fortune by the will  of his uncle, became a dissipated and debauched profligate, in so much  that he left no heinous crime unpractised, nor was there any  intoxicating drug which he had not tasted. Once I admonished him,  saying: \"O my son, wealth is a running stream, and pleasure revolves  like a millstone; or, in other words, profuse expense suits him only who  has a certain income. When you have no certain income, be frugal in your  expenses, because the sailors have a song, that if the rain does not  fall in the mountains, the Tigris will become a dry bed of sand in the  course of a year. Practise wisdom and virtue, and relinquish sensuality,  for when your money is spent you will suffer distress and expose  yourself to shame.\"[7] The young man, seduced by music and wine, would  not take my advice, but, in opposition to my arguments, said: \"It is  contrary to the wisdom of the sages to disturb our present enjoyments by  the dread of futurity. Why should they who possess fortune suffer  distress by anticipating sorrow? Go and be merry, O my enchanting  friend! We ought not to be uneasy to-day for what may happen to-morrow.  How would it become me, who am placed in the uppermost seat of  liberality, so that the fame of my bounty is wide spread? When a man has  acquired reputation by liberality and munificence, it does not become  him to tie up his money-bags. When your good name has been spread  through the street, you cannot shut your door against it.\" I perceived  (continues Saadi) that he did not approve of my admonition, and that my  warm breath did not affect his cold iron. I ceased advising, and,  quitting his society, returned into the corner of safety, in conformity  with the saying of the philosophers: \"Admonish and exhort as your  charity requires; if they mind not, it does not concern you. Although  thou knowest that they will not listen, nevertheless speak whatever you  know is advisable. It will soon come to pass that you will see the silly  fellow with his feet in the stocks, smiting his hands and exclaiming,  'Alas, that I did not listen to the wise man's advice!'\" After some  time, that which I had predicted from his dissolute conduct I saw  verified. He was clothed in rags, and begging a morsel of food. I was  distressed at his wretched condition, and did not think it consistent  with humanity to scratch his wound with reproach. But I said in my  heart: Profligate men, when intoxicated with pleasure, reflect not on  the day of poverty. The tree which in the summer has a profusion of  fruit is consequently without leaves in winter.        [7] Auvaiyar, the celebrated poetess of the Tamils (in          Southern India), who is said to have flourished in the          ninth century, says, in her poem entitled _Nalvali_:              Mark this: who lives beyond his means            Forfeits respect, loses his sense;            Where'er he goes through the seven births,            All count him knave; him women scorn.    The incapacity of some youths to receive instruction is always a source  of vexation to the pedagogue. Saadi tells us of a vazir who sent his  stupid son to a learned man, requesting him to impart some of his  knowledge to the lad, hoping that his mind would be improved. After  attempting to instruct him for some time without effect, he sent this  message to his father: \"Your son has no capacity, and has almost  distracted me. When nature has given capacity instruction will make  impressions; but if iron is not of the proper temper, no polishing will  make it good. Wash not a dog in the seven seas, for when he is wetted he  will only be the dirtier. If the ass that carried Jesus Christ were to  be taken to Mecca, at his return he would still be an ass.\"    One of the greatest sages of antiquity is reported to have said that all  the knowledge he had acquired merely taught him how little he did know;  and indeed it is only smatterers who are vain of their supposed  knowledge. A sensible young man, says Saadi, who had made considerable  progress in learning and virtue, was at the same time so discreet that  he would sit in the company of learned men without uttering a word. Once  his father said to him: \"My son, why do you not also say something you  know?\" He replied: \"I fear lest they should question me about something  of which I am ignorant, whereby I should suffer shame.\"    The advantages of education are thus set forth by a philosopher who was  exhorting his children: \"Acquire knowledge, for in worldly riches and  possessions no reliance can be placed.[8] Rank will be of no use out of  your own country; and on a journey money is in danger of being lost, for  either the thief may carry it off all at once, or the possessor may  consume it by degrees. But knowledge is a perennial spring of wealth,  and if a man of education cease to be opulent, yet he need not be  sorrowful, for knowledge of itself is riches.[9] A man of learning,  wheresoever he goes, is treated with respect, and sits in the uppermost  seat, whilst the ignorant man gets only scanty fare and encounters  distress.\" There once happened (adds Saadi) an insurrection in Damascus,  where every one deserted his habitation. The wise sons of a peasant  became the king's ministers, and the stupid sons of the vazir were  reduced to ask charity in the villages. If you want a paternal  inheritance, acquire from your father knowledge, for wealth may be spent  in ten days.        [8] \"All perishes except learning.\"--_Auvaiyar_.        [9] \"Learning is really the most valuable treasure.--A wise          man will never cease to learn.--He who has attained          learning by free self-application excels other          philosophers.--Let thy learning be thy best          friend.--What we have learned in youth is like writing          cut in stone.--If all else should be lost, what we have          learned will never be lost.--Learn one thing after          another, but not hastily.--Though one is of low birth,          learning will make him respected.\"--_Auvaiyar_.    In the following charming little tale Saadi recounts an interesting  incident in his own life: I remember that in my youth, as I was passing  through a street, I cast my eyes on a beautiful girl. It was in the  autumn, when the heat dried up all moisture from the mouth, and the  sultry wind made the marrow boil in the bones, so that, being unable to  support the sun's powerful rays, I was obliged to take shelter under the  shade of a wall, in hopes that some one would relieve me from the  distressing heat, and quench my thirst with a draught of water. Suddenly  from the portico of a house I beheld a female form whose beauty it is  impossible for the tongue of eloquence to describe, insomuch that it  seemed as if the dawn was rising in the obscurity of night, or as if the  Water of Immortality was issuing from the Land of Darkness. She held in  her hand a cup of snow-water, into which she had sprinkled sugar and  mixed with it the juice of the grape. I know not whether what I  perceived was the fragrance of rose-water, or that she had infused into  it a few drops from the blossom of her cheek. In short, I received the  cup from her beauteous hand, and, drinking the contents, found myself  restored to new life. The thirst of my soul is not such that it can be  allayed with a drop of pure water--the streams of whole rivers would not  satisfy it. How happy is that fortunate one whose eyes every morning may  behold such a countenance! He who is intoxicated with wine will be sober  again in the course of the night; but he who is intoxicated by the  cup-bearer will never recover his senses till the day of judgment.    Alas, poor Saadi! The lovely cup-bearer, who made such a lasting  impression on the heart of the young poet, was not destined for his  bride. His was indeed a sad matrimonial fate; and who can doubt but that  the beauteous form of the stranger maiden would often rise before his  mental view after he was married to the Xantippe who rendered some  portion of his life unhappy!    Among the tales under the heading of \"Imbecility and Old Age\" we have  one of \"olde January that wedded was to freshe May,\" which points its  moral now as it did six hundred years ago: When I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16955"],[0,"Three Translations of The Koran (Al-Qur'an) side (#5)"],[1,"truth; so they  sacrificed her, though they had not the mind to do (it).    002.072  Y: Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to  the crime: But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide.    P: And (remember) when ye slew a man and disagreed concerning it and  Allah brought forth that which ye were hiding.    S: And when you killed a man, then you disagreed with respect to that,  and Allah was to bring forth that which you were going to hide.    002.073  Y: So We said: \"Strike the (body) with a piece of the (heifer).\" Thus  Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye  may understand.    P: And We said: Smite him with some of it. Thus Allah bringeth the dead  to life and showeth you His portents so that ye may understand.    S: So We said: Strike the (dead body) with part of the (Sacrificed cow),  thus Allah brings the dead to life, and He shows you His signs so that  you may understand.    002.074  Y: Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and  even worse in hardness. For among rocks there are some from which  rivers gush forth; others there are which when split asunder send forth  water; and others which sink for fear of Allah. And Allah is not  unmindful of what ye do.    P: Then, even after that, your hearts were hardened and became as rocks,  or worse than rocks, for hardness. For indeed there are rocks from out  which rivers gush, and indeed there are rocks which split asunder so  that water floweth from them. And indeed there are rocks which fall  down for the fear of Allah. Allah is not unaware of what ye do.    S: Then your hearts hardened after that, so that they were like rocks,  rather worse in hardness; and surely there are some rocks from which  streams burst forth, and surely there are some of them which split  asunder so water issues out of them, and surely there are some of them  which fall down for fear of Allah, and Allah is not at all heedless of  what you do.    002.075  Y: Can ye (O ye men of Faith) entertain the hope that they will believe  in you?- Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of Allah, and  perverted it knowingly after they understood it.    P: Have ye any hope that they will be true to you when a party of them  used to listen to the word of Allah, then used to change it, after they  had understood it, knowingly?    S: Do you then hope that they would believe in you, and a party from  among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah, then altered it after  they had understood it, and they know (this).    002.076  Y: Behold! when they meet the men of Faith, they say: \"We believe\": But  when they meet each other in private, they say: \"Shall you tell them  what Allah hath revealed to you, that they may engage you in argument  about it before your Lord?\"- Do ye not understand (their aim)?    P: And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe.  But when they go apart one with another they say: Prate ye to them of  that which Allah hath disclosed to you that they may contend with you  before your Lord concerning it? Have ye then no sense?    S: And when they meet those who believe they say: We believe, and when  they are alone one with another they say: Do you talk to them of what  Allah has disclosed to you that they may contend with you by this  before your Lord? Do you not then understand?    002.077  Y: Know they not that Allah knoweth what they conceal and what they  reveal?    P: Are they then unaware that Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden  and that which they proclaim?    S: Do they not know that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they  make known?    002.078  Y: And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but (see  therein their own) desires, and they do nothing but conjecture.    P: Among them are unlettered folk who know the Scripture not except from  hearsay. They but guess.    S: And there are among them illiterates who know not the Book but only  lies, and they do but conjecture.    002.079  Y: Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then  say: \"This is from Allah,\" to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe  to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make  thereby.    P: Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands  and then say, \"This is from Allah,\" that they may purchase a small gain  therewith. Woe unto them for that their hands have written, and woe  unto them for that they earn thereby.    S: Woe, then, to those who write the book with their hands and then say:  This is from Allah, so that they may take for it a small price;  therefore woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them  for what they earn.    002.080  Y: And they say: \"The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered  days:\" Say: \"Have ye taken a promise from Allah, for He never breaks  His promise? or is it that ye say of Allah what ye do not know?\"    P: And they say: The Fire (of punishment) will not touch us save for a  certain number of days. Say: Have ye received a covenant from Allah -  truly Allah will not break His covenant - or tell ye concerning Allah  that which ye know not?    S: And they say: Fire shall not touch us but for a few days. Say: Have  you received a promise from Allah, then Allah will not fail to perform  His promise, or do you speak against Allah what you do not know?    002.081  Y: Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins,-  they are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide (For ever).    P: Nay, but whosoever hath done evil and his sin surroundeth him; such  are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein.    S: Yea, whoever earns evil and his sins beset him on every side, these  are the inmates of the fire; in it they shall abide.    002.082  Y: But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions  of the Garden: Therein shall they abide (For ever).    P: And those who believe and do good works: such are rightful owners of  the Garden. They will abide therein.    S: And (as for) those who believe and do good deeds, these are the  dwellers of the garden; in it they shall abide.    002.083  Y: And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (to this  effect): Worship none but Allah; treat with kindness your parents and  kindred, and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be  steadfast in prayer; and practise regular charity. Then did ye turn  back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now).    P: And (remember) when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel,  (saying): Worship none save Allah (only), and be good to parents and to  kindred and to orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to mankind; and  establish worship and pay the poor-due. Then, after that, ye slid back,  save a few of you, being averse.    S: And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel: You shall  not serve any but Allah and (you shall do) good to (your) parents, and  to the near of kin and to the orphans and the needy, and you shall  speak to men good words and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate. Then  you turned back except a few of you and (now too) you turn aside.    002.084  Y: And remember We took your covenant (to this effect): Shed no blood  amongst you, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this ye  solemnly ratified, and to this ye can bear witness.    P: And when We made with you a covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of  your people nor turn (a party of) your people out of your dwellings.  Then ye ratified (Our covenant) and ye were witnesses (thereto).    S: And when We made a covenant with you: You shall not shed your blood  and you shall not turn your people out of your cities; then you gave a  promise while you witnessed.    002.085  Y: After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and  banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against  them, in guilt and rancour; and if they come to you as captives, ye  ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is  it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject the  rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this  but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be  consigned to the most grievous penalty. For Allah is not unmindful of  what ye do.    P: Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people  from their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and  transgression? - and if they came to you as captives ye would ransom  them, whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you - Believe ye  in part of the Scripture and disbelieve ye in part thereof? And what is  the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world,  and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most  grievous doom. For Allah is not unaware of what ye do.    S: Yet you it is who slay your people and turn a party from among you  out of their homes, backing each other up against them unlawfully and  exceeding the limits; and if they should come to you, as captives you  would ransom them-- while their very turning out was unlawful for you.  Do you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in the other?  What then is the re ward of such among you as do this but disgrace in  the life of this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be  sent back to the most grievous chastisement, and Allah is not at all  heedless of what you do.    002.086  Y: These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of  the Hereafter: their penalty shall not be lightened nor shall they be  helped.    P: Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the  Hereafter. Their punishment will not be lightened, neither will they  have support.    S: These are they who buy the life of this world for the hereafter, so  their chastisement shall not be "]]]
