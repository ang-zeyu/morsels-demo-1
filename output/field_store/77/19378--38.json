No truth, however abstract, is ever  perceived, that will not probably at some time influence our earthly  action. You must remember that, when I talk of action here, I mean  action in the widest sense. I mean speech, I mean writing, I mean yeses  and noes, and tendencies 'from' things and tendencies 'toward' things,  and emotional determinations; and I mean them in the future as well as  in the immediate present. As I talk here, and you listen, it might seem  as if no action followed. You might call it a purely theoretic process,  with no practical result. But it _must_ have a practical result. It  cannot take place at all and leave your conduct unaffected. If not  to-day, then on some far future day, you will answer some question  differently by reason of what you are thinking now. Some of you will be  led by my words into new veins of inquiry, into reading special books.  These will develop your opinion, whether for or against. That opinion  will in turn be expressed, will receive criticism from others in your  environment, and will affect your standing in their eyes. We cannot  escape our destiny, which is practical; and even our most theoretic  faculties contribute to its working out.    These few reasons will perhaps smooth the way for you to acquiescence  in my proposal. As teachers, I sincerely think it will be a sufficient  conception for you to adopt of the youthful psychological phenomena  handed over to your inspection if you consider them from the point of  view of their relation to the future conduct of their possessor.  Sufficient at any rate as a first conception and as a main conception.  You should regard your professional task as if it consisted chiefly and  essentially in _training the pupil to behavior_; taking behavior, not in  the narrow sense of his manners, but in the very widest possible sense,  as including every possible sort of fit reaction on the circumstances  into which he may find himself brought by the vicissitudes of life.    The reaction may, indeed, often be a negative reaction. _Not_ to speak,  _not_ to move, is one of the most important of our duties, in certain  practical emergencies. \"Thou shalt refrain, renounce, abstain\"! This  often requires a great effort of will power, and, physiologically  considered, is just as positive a nerve function as is motor discharge.          IV. EDUCATION AND BEHAVIOR      In our foregoing talk we were led to frame a very simple conception of  what an education means. In the last analysis it consists in the  organizing of _resources_ in the human being, of powers of conduct which  shall fit him to his social and physical world. An 'uneducated' person  is one who is nonplussed by all but the most habitual situations. On the  contrary, one who is educated is able practically to extricate himself,  by means of the examples with which his memory is stored and of the  abstract conceptions which he has acquired, from circumstances in which  he never was placed before. Education, in short, cannot be better  described than by calling it _the organization of acquired habits of  conduct and tendencies to behavior_.    To illustrate. You and I are each and all of us educated, in our several  ways; and we show our education at this present moment by different  conduct. It would be quite impossible for me, with my mind technically  and professionally organized as it is, and with the optical stimulus  which your presence affords, to remain sitting here entirely silent and  inactive. Something tells me that I am expected to speak, and must  speak; something forces me to keep on speaking. My organs of  articulation are continuously innervated by outgoing currents, which the  currents passing inward at my eyes and through my educated brain have  set in motion; and the particular movements which they make have their  form and order determined altogether by the training of all my past  years of lecturing and reading. Your conduct, on the other hand, might  seem at first sight purely receptive and inactive,--leaving out those  among you who happen to be taking notes. But the very listening which  you are carrying on is itself a determinate kind of conduct. All the  muscular tensions of your body are distributed in a peculiar way as you  listen. Your head, your eyes, are fixed characteristically. And, when  the lecture is over, it will inevitably eventuate in some stroke of  behavior, as I said on the previous occasion: you may be guided  differently in some special emergency in the schoolroom by words  which I now let fall.--So it is with the impressions you will make  there on your pupil. You should get into the habit of regarding them  all as leading to the acquisition by him of capacities for  behavior,--emotional, social, bodily, vocal, technical, or what not.  And, this being the case, you ought to feel willing, in a general way,  and without hair-splitting or farther ado, to take up for the purposes  of these lectures with the biological conception of the mind, as of  something given us for practical use. That conception will certainly  cover the greater part of your own educational work.    If we reflect upon the various ideals of education that are prevalent in  the different countries, we see that what they all aim at is to organize  capacities for conduct. This is most immediately obvious in Germany,  where the explicitly avowed aim of the higher education is to turn the  student into an instrument for advancing scientific discovery. The  German universities are proud of the number of young specialists whom  they turn out every year,--not necessarily men of any original force of  intellect, but men so trained to research that when their professor  gives them an historical or philological thesis to prepare, or a bit of  laboratory work to do, with a general indication as to the best method,  they can go off by themselves and use apparatus and consult sources in  such a way as to grind out in the requisite number of months some little  pepper-corn of new truth worthy of being added to the store of extant  human information on that subject. Little else is recognized in Germany  as a man's title to academic advancement than his ability thus to show  himself an efficient instrument of research.    In England, it might seem at first sight as if the higher education of  the universities aimed at the production of certain static types of  character rather than at the development of what one may call this  dynamic scientific efficiency. Professor Jowett, when asked what Oxford  could do for its students, is said to have replied, \"Oxford can teach an  English gentleman how to _be_ an English gentleman.\" But, if you ask  what it means to 'be' an English gentleman, the only reply is in terms  of conduct and behavior. An English gentleman is a bundle of  specifically qualified reactions, a creature who for all the emergencies  of life has his line of behavior distinctly marked out for him in  advance. Here, as elsewhere, England expects every man to do his duty.          V. THE NECESSITY OF REACTIONS      If all this be true, then immediately one general aphorism emerges which  ought by logical right to dominate the entire conduct of the teacher in  the classroom.    _No reception without reaction, no impression without correlative  expression_,--this is the great maxim which the teacher ought never to  forget.    An impression which simply flows in at the pupil's eyes or ears, and in  no way modifies his active life, is an impression gone to waste. It is  physiologically incomplete. It leaves no fruits behind it in the way of  capacity acquired. Even as mere impression, it fails to produce its  proper effect upon the memory; for, to remain fully among the  acquisitions of this latter faculty, it must be wrought into the whole  cycle of our operations. Its _motor consequences_ are what clinch it.  Some effect due to it in the way of an activity must return to the mind  in the form of the _sensation of having acted_, and connect itself with  the impression. The most durable impressions are those on account of  which we speak or act, or else are inwardly convulsed.    The older pedagogic method of learning things by rote, and reciting them  parrot-like in the schoolroom, rested on the truth that a thing merely  read or heard, and never verbally reproduced, contracts the weakest  possible adhesion in the mind. Verbal recitation or reproduction is thus  a highly important kind of reactive behavior on our impressions; and it  is to be feared that, in the reaction against the old parrot-recitations  as the beginning and end of instruction, the extreme value of verbal  recitation as an element of complete training may nowadays be too much  forgotten.    When we turn to modern pedagogics, we see how enormously the field of  reactive conduct has been extended by the introduction of all those  methods of concrete object teaching which are the glory of our  contemporary schools. Verbal reactions, useful as they are, are  insufficient. The pupil's words may be right, but the conceptions  corresponding to them are often direfully wrong. In a modern school,  therefore, they form only a small part of what the pupil is required to  do. He must keep notebooks, make drawings, plans, and maps, take  measurements, enter the laboratory and perform experiments, consult  authorities, and write essays. He must do in his fashion what is often  laughed at by outsiders when it appears in prospectuses under the title  of 'original work,' but what is really the only possible training for  the doing of original work thereafter. The most colossal improvement  which recent years have seen in secondary education lies in the  introduction of the manual training schools; not because they will give  us a people more handy and practical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#5)"],[1,"has  lasted from all eternity.    The means of escaping from this endless sa/ms/ara, the way out of which  can never be found by the non-enlightened soul, are furnished by the  Veda. The karmaka/nd/a indeed, whose purport it is to enjoin certain  actions, cannot lead to final release; for even the most meritorious  works necessarily lead to new forms of embodied existence. And in the  j/n/anaka/nd/a of the Veda also two different parts have to be  distinguished, viz., firstly, those chapters and passages which treat of  Brahman in so far as related to the world, and hence characterised by  various attributes, i.e. of I/s/vara or the lower Brahman; and,  secondly, those texts which set forth the nature of the highest Brahman  transcending all qualities, and the fundamental identity of the  individual soul with that highest Brahman. Devout meditation on Brahman  as suggested by passages of the former kind does not directly lead to  final emancipation; the pious worshipper passes on his death into the  world of the lower Brahman only, where he continues to exist as a  distinct individual soul--although in the enjoyment of great power and  knowledge--until at last he reaches the highest knowledge, and, through  it, final release.--That student of the Veda, on the other hand, whose  soul has been enlightened by the texts embodying the higher knowledge of  Brahman, whom passages such as the great saying, 'That art thou,' have  taught that there is no difference between his true Self and the highest  Self, obtains at the moment of death immediate final release, i.e. he  withdraws altogether from the influence of Maya, and asserts himself in  his true nature, which is nothing else but the absolute highest Brahman.    Thus /S/a@nkara.--According to Ramanuja, on the other hand, the teaching  of the Upanishads has to be summarised as follows.--There exists only  one all-embracing being called Brahman or the highest Self of the Lord.  This being is not destitute of attributes, but rather endowed with all  imaginable auspicious qualities. It is not 'intelligence,'--as  /S/a@nkara maintains,--but intelligence is its chief attribute. The Lord  is all-pervading, all-powerful, all-knowing, all-merciful; his nature is  fundamentally antagonistic to all evil. He contains within himself  whatever exists. While, according to /S/a@nkara, the only reality is to  be found in the non-qualified homogeneous highest Brahman which can only  be defined as pure 'Being' or pure thought, all plurality being a mere  illusion; Brahman--according to Ramanuja's view--comprises within itself  distinct elements of plurality which all of them lay claim to absolute  reality of one and the same kind. Whatever is presented to us by  ordinary experience, viz. matter in all its various modifications and  the individual souls of different classes and degrees, are essential  real constituents of Brahman's nature. Matter and souls (a/k/it and  /k/it) constitute, according to Ramanuja's terminology, the body of the  Lord; they stand to him in the same relation of entire dependence and  subserviency in which the matter forming an animal or vegetable body  stands to its soul or animating principle. The Lord pervades and rules  all things which exist--material or immaterial--as their antaryamin; the  fundamental text for this special Ramanuja tenet--which in the writings  of the sect is quoted again and again--is the so-called antaryamin  brahma/n/a. (B/ri/. Up. III, 7) which says, that within all elements,  all sense organs, and, lastly, within all individual souls, there abides  an inward ruler whose body those elements, sense-organs, and individual  souls constitute.--Matter and souls as forming the body of the Lord are  also called modes of him (prakara). They are to be looked upon as his  effects, but they have enjoyed the kind of individual existence which is  theirs from all eternity, and will never be entirely resolved into  Brahman. They, however, exist in two different, periodically  alternating, conditions. At some times they exist in a subtle state in  which they do not possess those qualities by which they are ordinarily  known, and there is then no distinction of individual name and form.  Matter in that state is unevolved (avyakta); the individual souls are  not joined to material bodies, and their intelligence is in a state of  contraction, non-manifestation (sa@nko/k/a). This is the pralaya state  which recurs at the end of each kalpa, and Brahman is then said to be in  its causal condition (kara/n/avastha). To that state all those  scriptural passages refer which speak of Brahman or the Self as being in  the beginning one only, without a second. Brahman then is indeed not  absolutely one, for it contains within itself matter and souls in a  germinal condition; but as in that condition they are so subtle as not  to allow of individual distinctions being made, they are not counted as  something second in addition to Brahman.--When the pralaya state comes  to an end, creation takes place owing to an act of volition on the  Lord's part. Primary unevolved matter then passes over into its other  condition; it becomes gross and thus acquires all those sensible  attributes, visibility, tangibility, and so on, which are known from  ordinary experience. At the same time the souls enter into connexion  with material bodies corresponding to the degree of merit or demerit  acquired by them in previous forms of existence; their intelligence at  the same time undergoes a certain expansion (vika/s/a). The Lord,  together with matter in its gross state and the 'expanded' souls, is  Brahman in the condition of an effect (karyavastha). Cause and effect  are thus at the bottom the same; for the effect is nothing but the cause  which has undergone a certain change (pari/n/ama). Hence the cause being  known, the effect is known likewise.    Owing to the effects of their former actions the individual souls are  implicated in the sa/m/sara, the endless cycle of birth, action, and  death, final escape from which is to be obtained only through the study  of the j/n/anaka/nd/a of the Veda. Compliance with the injunctions of  the karmaka/nd/a does not lead outside the sa/m/sara; but he who,  assisted by the grace of the Lord, cognizes--and meditates on--him in  the way prescribed by the Upanishads reaches at his death final  emancipation, i.e. he passes through the different stages of the path of  the gods up to the world of Brahman and there enjoys an everlasting  blissful existence from which there is no return into the sphere of  transmigration. The characteristics of the released soul are similar to  those of Brahman; it participates in all the latter's glorious qualities  and powers, excepting only Brahman's power to emit, rule, and retract  the entire world.    The chief points in which the two systems sketched above agree on the  one hand and diverge on the other may be shortly stated as  follows.--Both systems teach advaita, i.e. non-duality or monism. There  exist not several fundamentally distinct principles, such as the  prak/r/iti and the purushas of the Sa@nkhyas, but there exists only one  all-embracing being. While, however, the advaita taught by /S/a@nkara is  a rigorous, absolute one, Ramanuja's doctrine has to be characterised as  visish/t/a advaita, i.e. qualified non-duality, non-duality with a  difference. According to Sankara, whatever is, is Brahman, and Brahman  itself is absolutely homogeneous, so that all difference and plurality  must be illusory. According to Ramanuja also, whatever is, is Brahman;  but Brahman is not of a homogeneous nature, but contains within itself  elements of plurality owing to which it truly manifests itself in a  diversified world. The world with its variety of material forms of  existence and individual souls is not unreal Maya, but a real part of  Brahman's nature, the body investing the universal Self. The Brahman of  /S/a@nkara is in itself impersonal, a homogeneous mass of objectless  thought, transcending all attributes; a personal God it becomes only  through its association with the unreal principle of Maya, so  that--strictly speaking--/S/a@nkara's personal God, his I/s/vara, is  himself something unreal. Ramanuja's Brahman, on the other hand, is  essentially a personal God, the all-powerful and all-wise ruler of a  real world permeated and animated by his spirit. There is thus no room  for the distinction between a param nirgu/n/am and an apara/m/ sagu/n/am  brahma, between Brahman and I/s/vara.--/S/a@nkara's individual soul is  Brahman in so far as limited by the unreal upadhis due to Maya. The  individual soul of Ramanuja, on the other hand, is really individual; it  has indeed sprung from Brahman and is never outside Brahman, but  nevertheless it enjoys a separate personal existence and will remain a  personality for ever--The release from sa/m/sara means, according to  /S/a@nkara, the absolute merging of the individual soul in Brahman, due  to the dismissal of the erroneous notion that the soul is distinct from  Brahman; according to Ramanuja it only means the soul's passing from the  troubles of earthly life into a kind of heaven or paradise where it will  remain for ever in undisturbed personal bliss.--As Ramanuja does not  distinguish a higher and lower Brahman, the distinction of a higher and  lower knowledge is likewise not valid for him; the teaching of the  Upanishads is not twofold but essentially one, and leads the enlightened  devotee to one result only [1].    I now proceed to give a conspectus of the contents of the Vedanta-sutras  according to /S/a@nkara in which at the same time all the more important  points concerning which Ramanuja disagrees will be noted. We shall here  have to enter into details which to many may appear tedious. But it is  only on a broad substratum of accurately stated details that we can hope  to establish any definite conclusions regarding the comparative value"]]]
