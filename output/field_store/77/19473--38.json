I think we had better hurry. I don't fancy being caught in the  woods in bad weather. Hustle, everybody.\"    As they hurried along the path a blast of wind blew full in their faces.  The whole forest seemed suddenly astir. There were strange sounds from  every direction. The branches creaked and the dry leaves fell rattling  to the ground by hundreds. Another gust of wind filled their eyes and  nostrils with fine dust.    \"Don't be frightened,\" called Tom. \"Follow me.\"    He led the way with Reddy, but the storm was upon them before they had  gone ten steps. The wind almost blew them off their feet and black  darkness settled down over the woods. They could just see the outlines  of the trees as they staggered on, a blinding rain drenching them to the  skin.    Tom divided the party into two sections, four in one and five in the  other. They were to hold each other's hands tightly and keep together.  Frequent flashes of lightning revealed the woods in a tremendous state  of agitation and it seemed better to be moving than to stand still and  watch the terrifying spectacle.    On they stumbled, but suddenly came to grief, for the four in front fell  headlong over a tree that had been blown across the path, and the other  five hearing their cries of warning too late, followed after.    By the time they had picked themselves up the storm had grown so furious  that they could only press miserably together and wait for it to pass.    Suddenly Tom amazed them all by putting his hands to his mouth and  blowing a strange kind of hollow whistle that sounded like the note of a  trumpet.    He repeated the whistle again and again. \"You may not believe it,\" he  said between calls, \"but the hunter who taught me this, told me never to  use it unless I was in dire need. Then help of some sort would surely  come. It is called the Elf's Horn.\"    \"Did you ever try it before,\" asked Reddy curiously.    \"No,\" he answered, \"I never did. I suppose it's only superstition, but  I love hunter's lore. Perhaps it may work. Who knows?\"    \"Hello-o-o!\" cried a voice seemingly close by. \"Hello-o-o!\"    \"Where are you?\" called Tom.    \"This way,\" answered the voice, and a light flashed a little distance  off, revealing to them a man waving a lantern with one hand and  beckoning with the other. One and all dashed toward the light, feeling  that shelter was at hand.    \"It must be a hunter,\" panted Tom, \"and he has heard the Elf's Horn.\"    It was a hunter, and none other than old Jean. Their blind wandering had  taken them straight to the hunter's cabin.    \"It is Mademoiselle Grace and her friends,\" cried the old man with  delight. \"When the sky grow so dark, I take my lantern and go out to my  trap I have set this morning. Then I hear a strange whistle, many  times, and I think some one get lost and I cry 'hello,' and you answer  and I find mademoiselle and her friends.\"    \"That was the Elf's Horn, Jean,\" replied Tom, \"and you heard because you  are a hunter.\"    \"I know not what monsieur mean by Elf Horn, but I hear whistle, anyhow,  and come,\" remarked the old man, smiling.    The others laughed.    \"It's a shame to spoil it,\" replied David, \"but I am afraid your Elf's  Horn and Jean's helloing were just a coincidence.\"    \"Coincidence or not,\" replied Tom good-naturedly, \"my faith in the fairy  horn is now unshakable. I shall use it again if I ever need to.\"    Before a blazing fire kindled by Jean in the big fireplace, the whole  party dried themselves. The old hunter listened to the story of their  mad scramble through the woods with many expressions of sympathy.    It was eight o'clock when the storm had abated sufficiently to allow  them to sally forth, and in a short time they were in Oakdale.    Fifteen minutes later they were telling Mr. and Mrs. Harlowe just how it  all happened.          CHAPTER IV    GRACE MAKES A DISCOVERY      The Monday after the walking expedition, Grace Harlowe set out for  school full of an idea that had been revolving in her busy brain for  weeks. The time had come for herself and for her three chums to bind  themselves together as a sorority. As charter members, they would  initiate four other girls, as soon as proper rites could be thought of.  It should be a Greek letter society. Grace thought \"Phi Sigma Tau\" would  sound well. Aside from the social part, their chief object would be to  keep a watchful eye open for girls in school who needed assistance of  any sort.    Mrs. Gray's anxiety over Eleanor Savell had set the bee in Grace's  bonnet buzzing, and now her plans were practically perfected. All that  remained to be done was to tell her three friends, and consult them as  to what other four girls would be eligible to membership.    Her proposition was hailed with acclamation by Anne, Nora and Jessica.  Miriam Nesbit, Marian Barber, Eva Allen and Eleanor Savell were chosen  as candidates and promptly notified to report at Jessica's home the next  Thursday evening for initiation. They at once accepted the invitation  and solemnly promised to be there.    \"'Where are you going, my pretty maid?'\" said David Nesbit, stopping  directly in front of Grace Harlowe as she hurried toward the Bright home  the following Thursday evening.    Grace laughed merrily, dropped a little curtsy and recited, \"I'm going  to an initiation, sir, she said.\"    \"'And may I go with you, my pretty maid?'\" replied David, bowing low.    \"No boys allowed there, sir, she said.\"    \"That settles it,\" sighed David. \"I suppose a sorority is about to come  to the surface. Am I right, and will you take me along?\"    \"Yes, we are going to initiate members into our new sorority, but you  can't come, so you might as well be resigned to fate,\" retorted Grace.  \"We didn't receive invitations to your fraternity initiations.\"    \"Be kind to Anne, won't you. Tell her she has my sympathy,\" said David  solemnly.    \"Anne is a charter member, if you please,\" laughed Grace. \"She is spared  the ordeals of initiation. But Miriam will not escape so easily. She is  one of the candidates.\"    \"Ah, ha!\" exclaimed David. \"That's what she was so mysterious over.  I tried to find out where she was going, but she wouldn't tell me. By  the way, where does the affair take place?\" he added, trying to look  innocent.    \"Don't you wish you knew?\" teased Grace. \"However, you shan't find out  from me. I know too well what would happen if you boys traced us to our  lair. But I must go or I shall be late. Good night, David. Please be  good and don't follow me. Promise me you won't.\"    \"I never make rash promises,\" answered David, smiling. \"Be merciful to  the candidates.\" Lifting his cap, the young man hurried off and turned  the corner without looking back.    \"I wonder what I had better do,\" Grace mused. \"I know perfectly well  that David Nesbit won't go away. He will wait until he thinks I am far  enough up the street and then he'll follow me. As soon as he finds out  where I am going he'll rush back and hunt up Hippy Wingate and Reddy  Brooks. Goodness knows what the three of them will plan.\"    She decided to turn down a side street, go back one block and into the  public library. She could easily leave the library by the side entrance  and cut across Putnam Square. That would mislead David, although no  doubt he would find them before the evening was over.    Grace lost no time in putting her plan into action. As she hurried into  the library she looked back, but saw no sign of David. When she reached  Putnam Square she almost ran along the broad asphalt walk. It was  fifteen minutes past seven by the city hall clock, and she did not wish  to be late. The girls had agreed to be there by half past seven. She was  almost across the square when her ear caught the sound of a low sob.  Grace glanced quickly about. The square was practically deserted, but  under one of the great trees, curled up on a bench, was a girl. Without  an instant's hesitation Grace made for the bench. She touched the girl  on the shoulder and said, \"You seem to be in distress. Can I do anything  to help you?\"    Then Grace gave a little surprised exclamation. The face turned toward  her was that of Mabel Allison, the freshman prize girl. The glare from  the neighboring light revealed her tear-swollen eyes and quivering lips.  She gave Grace one long, agonized look, then dropped her head on her arm  and sobbed harder than ever.    \"Why, Miss Allison, don't cry so,\" soothed Grace. \"Tell me what your  trouble is. Perhaps I can be of some service to you. I've wanted to know  you ever since you won the freshman prize last June, and so has Anne  Pierson. She won the prize the year before, you know.\"    The girl nodded, but she could not sufficiently control herself to  speak.    Grace stood silently waiting until the other should find her voice. A  moment more and Mabel Allison began to speak in a plaintive little voice  that went straight to Grace's heart:    \"You are Grace Harlowe. I believe every girl in Oakdale High School  knows you. I have heard so much about you, but I never dreamed that  you'd ever speak to me.\"    \"Nonsense,\" replied Grace, laughing. \"I'm just a girl like yourself.  There isn't anything remarkable about me. I'm very glad to know you,  Miss Allison, but I am sorry to find you so unhappy. Can't you tell me  about it?\" she coaxed, sitting down on the bench and slipping one arm  around the shabby little figure.    Mabel's lip quivered again. Then she turned impulsively toward Grace and  said: \"Yes; I will tell you, although no one can help me. I suppose you  don't know where I live or anything about me, do you?\"    \"No,\" replied Grace, shaking her head, \"but I'd be glad to have you tell  me.\"    \"Well,\" continued Mabel, \"I'm"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17829"],[0,"The Trained Memory (#5)"],[1,"of Pick_]    Thus, Pick, in \"Memory and Its Doctors,\" among other devices, presents a  well-known \"figure-alphabet\" as of aid in remembering numbers. Each  figure of the Arabic notation is represented by one or more letters, and  the number to be recalled is translated into such letters as can best be  arranged into a catch word or phrase. To quote: \"The most common  figure-alphabet is this:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0    t  n  m  r  l sh  g  f  b  s  d              j  k  v  p  o                ch  c                 g qu        z    \"To briefly show its use, suppose it is desired to fix 1,142 feet in a  second as the velocity of sound, t, t, r, n, are the letters and order  required. Fill up with vowels forming a phrase like 'tight run' and  connect it by some such flight of the imagination as that if a man tried  to keep up with the velocity of sound, he would have a 'tight run.'\"    [Sidenote: _Scientific Pedagogy_]    The same principle is at the basis of all efficient pedagogy. The  competent teacher endeavors by some association of ideas to link every  new fact with those facts which the pupil already has acquired.    In the pursuit of this method the teacher will \"compare all that is far  off and foreign to something that is near home, making the unknown plain  by the example of the known, and connecting all the instruction with the  personal experience of the pupil--if the teacher is to explain the  distance of the sun from the earth, let him ask, 'If anyone there in the  sun fired off a cannon straight at you, what should you do?' 'Get out of  the way,' would be the answer. 'No need of that,' the teacher might  reply; 'you may quietly go to sleep in your room and get up again; you  may wait till your confirmation day, you may learn a trade, and grow as  old as I am--_then only_ will the cannon-ball be getting near, _then_  you may jump to one side! See, so great as that is the sun's distance!'\"    We shall now show you how to apply this principle in improving your  memory and in making a more complete use of your really vast store of  knowledge.      Rule I. _Make systematic use of your sense-organs._    [Sidenote: _How to Remember Names_]    Do you find it difficult to remember names? It is because you do not  link them in your mind with enough associations. Every time a man is  introduced to you, look about you. Who is present? Take note of as many  and as great a variety of surrounding facts and circumstances as  possible. Think of the man's name, and take another look at his face,  his dress, his physique. Think of his name, and at the same time his  voice and manner. Think of his name, and mark the place where you are  now for the first time meeting him. Think of his name in conjunction  with the name and personality of the friend who presented him.    Memory is not a distinct faculty of mind in the sense that one man is  generously endowed in that respect while another is deficient. Memory,  as meaning the power of voluntary recall, is wholly a question of  trained habits of mental operation.    Your memory is just as good as mine or any other man's. It is your  indifference to what you would call \"irrelevant facts\" that is at fault.  Therefore, cultivate habits of observation. Fortify the observed facts  you wish to recall with a multitude of outside associations. Never rest  with a mere halfway knowledge of things.    [Sidenote: _Five Exercises for Developing Observation_]    To assist you in training yourself in those habits of observation that  make a good memory of outside facts, we append the following exercises:    _a._ Walk slowly through a room with which you are not familiar. Then  make a list of all the contents of the room you can recall. Do this  every day for a week, using a different room each time. Do it not  half-heartedly, but as if your life depended on your ability to  remember. At the end of the week you will be surprised at the  improvement you have made.    _b._ As you walk along the street, observe all that occurs in a space of  one block, things heard as well as things seen. Two hours later make a  list of all you can recall. Do this twice a day for ten days. Then  compare results.    _c._ Make a practice of recounting each night the incidents of the day.  The prospect of having this to do will cause you unconsciously to  observe more attentively.    This is the method by which Thurlow Weed acquired his phenomenal memory.  As a young man with political ambitions he had been much troubled by  his inability to recall names and faces. So he began the practice each  night of telling his wife the most minute details of incidents that had  occurred during the day. He kept this up for fifty years, and it so  trained his powers of observation that he became as well known for his  unfailing memory as for his political adroitness.    _d._ Glance once at an outline map of some State. Put it out of sight  and draw one as nearly like it as you can. Then compare it with the  original. Do this frequently.    [Sidenote: _Invention and Thought-Memory_]    _e._ Have some one read you a sentence out of a book and you then repeat  it. Do this daily, gradually increasing the length of the quotation from  short sentences to whole paragraphs. Try to find out what is the  extreme limit of your ability in this respect compared with that of  other members of your family.      Rule II. _Fix ideas by their associates._    There are other things to be remembered besides facts of outside  observation. You are not one whose life is passed entirely in a physical  world. You live also within. Your mind is unceasingly at work with the  materials of the past painting the pictures of the future. You are  called upon to scheme, to plan, to devise, to invent, to compose and to  foresee.    If all this mental work is not wasted energy, you must be able to recall  its conclusions when occasion requires. A happy thought comes to  you--will you remember it tomorrow when the hour for action arrives?  There is but one way to be sure, and that is by making a study of the  whole associative mental process.    Review the train of ideas by which you reached your conclusion. Carry  the thought on in mind to its legitimate conclusion. See yourself acting  upon it. Mark its relations to other persons. Note all the details of  the mental picture. In other words, to remember thoughts, cultivate  thought-observation just as you cultivate sense-observation to remember  outside matters.    [Sidenote: _Three Exercises for Developing Thought-Memory_]    To train yourself in thought-memory, use the following exercises:    _a._ Every morning at eight o'clock, sharp on the minute, fix upon a  certain idea and determine to recall it at a certain hour during the  day. Put your whole will into this resolution. Try to imagine what  activities you will be engaged in at the appointed hour, and think of  the chosen idea as identified with those activities. Associate it in  your mind with some object that will be at hand when the set time comes.  Having thus fixed the idea in your mind, forget it. Do not refer to it  in your thoughts. With practice you will find yourself automatically  carrying out your own orders. Persist in this exercise for at least  three months.    _b._ Every night when you retire fix upon the hour at which you wish to  get up in the morning. In connection with your waking at that hour,  think of all the sounds that will be apt to be occurring at that  particular time. Bar every other thought from your consciousness and  fall asleep with the intense determination to arise at the time set. By  all means, get up instantly when you awaken. Keep up this exercise and  you will soon be able to awaken at any hour you may wish.    [Sidenote: _How to Compel Recollection_]    _c._ Every morning outline the general plan of your activities for the  day. Select only the important things. Do not bother with the details.  Determine upon the logical order for your day's work. Think not so much  of _how_ you are to do things as of the _things_ you are to do. Keep  your mind on results. And having made your plan, stick to it. Be your  own boss. Let nothing tempt you from your set purpose. Make this daily  planning a habit and hold to it through life. It will give you a great  lift toward whatever prize you seek.      Rule III. _Search systematically and persistently._    When once you have started upon an effort at recollection, persevere.  The date or face or event that you wish to recall _is bound up with a  multitude of other facts of observation and of your mind life_ of the  past. Success in recalling it depends simply upon your ability _to hit  upon some idea so indissolubly associated with the object of search that  the recall of one automatically recalls the other_. Consequently the  thing to do is to hold your attention to one definite line of thought  until you have exhausted its possibilities. You must pass in review all  the associated matters and suppress or ignore them until the right one  comes to mind. This may be a short-cut process or a roundabout process,  but it will bring results nine times out of ten, and if habitually  persisted in will greatly improve your power of voluntary recall.    [Sidenote: _Formation of Correct Memory Habits_]      Rule IV. _The instant you recollect a thing to be done, do it._    Every idea that memory thrusts into your consciousness carries with it  the impulse to act upon it. If you fail to do so, the matter may not  again occur to you, or when it does it may be too late.    _Your mental mechanism will serve you faithfully only as long as you act  upon its suggestions._    [Sidenote: _NOW!_]    This is as true of bodily habits as of business affairs. The time to act  upon an important matter that just now comes to mind is not \"tomorrow\"  or a \"little later,\" but _NOW_.    What you do from moment to moment tells the story of your career. Ideas  that come to you should be"]]]
