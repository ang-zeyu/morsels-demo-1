She could  scarcely stand this.    But Martha was not at all crushed.    \"Eh! I can see it's different,\" she answered almost sympathetically. \"I  dare say it's because there's such a lot o' blacks there instead o'  respectable white people. When I heard you was comin' from India I  thought you was a black too.\"    Mary sat up in bed furious.    \"What!\" she said. \"What! You thought I was a native. You--you daughter  of a pig!\"    Martha stared and looked hot.    \"Who are you callin' names?\" she said. \"You needn't be so vexed. That's  not th' way for a young lady to talk. I've nothin' against th' blacks.  When you read about 'em in tracts they're always very religious. You  always read as a black's a man an' a brother. I've never seen a black  an' I was fair pleased to think I was goin' to see one close. When I  come in to light your fire this mornin' I crep' up to your bed an'  pulled th' cover back careful to look at you. An' there you was,\"  disappointedly, \"no more black than me--for all you're so yeller.\"    Mary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.    \"You thought I was a native! You dared! You don't know anything about  natives! They are not people--they're servants who must salaam to you.  You know nothing about India. You know nothing about anything!\"    She was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl's simple  stare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away  from everything she understood and which understood her, that she threw  herself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.  She sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a  little frightened and quite sorry for her. She went to the bed and bent  over her.    \"Eh! you mustn't cry like that there!\" she begged. \"You mustn't for  sure. I didn't know you'd be vexed. I don't know anythin' about  anythin'--just like you said. I beg your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin'.\"    There was something comforting and really friendly in her queer  Yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary. She  gradually ceased crying and became quiet. Martha looked relieved.    \"It's time for thee to get up now,\" she said. \"Mrs. Medlock said I was  to carry tha' breakfast an' tea an' dinner into th' room next to this.  It's been made into a nursery for thee. I'll help thee on with thy  clothes if tha'll get out o' bed. If th' buttons are at th' back tha'  cannot button them up tha'self.\"    When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from the  wardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the night  before with Mrs. Medlock.    \"Those are not mine,\" she said. \"Mine are black.\"    She looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with cool  approval:    \"Those are nicer than mine.\"    \"These are th' ones tha' must put on,\" Martha answered. \"Mr. Craven  ordered Mrs. Medlock to get 'em in London. He said 'I won't have a child  dressed in black wanderin' about like a lost soul,' he said. 'It'd make  the place sadder than it is. Put color on her.' Mother she said she knew  what he meant. Mother always knows what a body means. She doesn't hold  with black hersel'.\"    \"I hate black things,\" said Mary.    The dressing process was one which taught them both something. Martha  had \"buttoned up\" her little sisters and brothers but she had never seen  a child who stood still and waited for another person to do things for  her as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.    \"Why doesn't tha' put on tha' own shoes?\" she said when Mary quietly  held out her foot.    \"My Ayah did it,\" answered Mary, staring. \"It was the custom.\"    She said that very often--\"It was the custom.\" The native servants were  always saying it. If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had not  done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, \"It is not  the custom\" and one knew that was the end of the matter.    It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but  stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she was  ready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite  Manor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to  her--things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and picking  up things she let fall. If Martha had been a well-trained fine young  lady's maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and  would have known that it was her business to brush hair, and button  boots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only an  untrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage  with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of  doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who  were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble  over things.    If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she would  perhaps have laughed at Martha's readiness to talk, but Mary only  listened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner. At first  she was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in  her good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she was saying.    \"Eh! you should see 'em all,\" she said. \"There's twelve of us an' my  father only gets sixteen shilling a week. I can tell you my mother's put  to it to get porridge for 'em all. They tumble about on th' moor an'  play there all day an' mother says th' air of th' moor fattens 'em. She  says she believes they eat th' grass same as th' wild ponies do. Our  Dickon, he's twelve years old and he's got a young pony he calls his  own.\"    \"Where did he get it?\" asked Mary.    \"He found it on th' moor with its mother when it was a little one an' he  began to make friends with it an' give it bits o' bread an' pluck young  grass for it. And it got to like him so it follows him about an' it  lets him get on its back. Dickon's a kind lad an' animals likes him.\"    Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thought  she should like one. So she began to feel a slight interest in Dickon,  and as she had never before been interested in any one but herself, it  was the dawning of a healthy sentiment. When she went into the room  which had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it was rather  like the one she had slept in. It was not a child's room, but a grown-up  person's room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak  chairs. A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast.  But she had always had a very small appetite, and she looked with  something more than indifference at the first plate Martha set before  her.    \"I don't want it,\" she said.    \"Tha' doesn't want thy porridge!\" Martha exclaimed incredulously.    \"No.\"    \"Tha' doesn't know how good it is. Put a bit o' treacle on it or a bit  o' sugar.\"    \"I don't want it,\" repeated Mary.    \"Eh!\" said Martha. \"I can't abide to see good victuals go to waste. If  our children was at this table they'd clean it bare in five minutes.\"    \"Why?\" said Mary coldly.    \"Why!\" echoed Martha. \"Because they scarce ever had their stomachs full  in their lives. They're as hungry as young hawks an' foxes.\"    \"I don't know what it is to be hungry,\" said Mary, with the indifference  of ignorance.    Martha looked indignant.    \"Well, it would do thee good to try it. I can see that plain enough,\"  she said outspokenly. \"I've no patience with folk as sits an' just  stares at good bread an' meat. My word! don't I wish Dickon and Phil an'  Jane an' th' rest of 'em had what's here under their pinafores.\"    \"Why don't you take it to them?\" suggested Mary.    \"It's not mine,\" answered Martha stoutly. \"An' this isn't my day out. I  get my day out once a month same as th' rest. Then I go home an' clean  up for mother an' give her a day's rest.\"    Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.    \"You wrap up warm an' run out an' play you,\" said Martha. \"It'll do you  good and give you some stomach for your meat.\"    Mary went to the window. There were gardens and paths and big trees, but  everything looked dull and wintry.    \"Out? Why should I go out on a day like this?\"    \"Well, if tha' doesn't go out tha'lt have to stay in, an' what has tha'  got to do?\"    Mary glanced about her. There was nothing to do. When Mrs. Medlock had  prepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement. Perhaps it would  be better to go and see what the gardens were like.    \"Who will go with me?\" she inquired.    Martha stared.    \"You'll go by yourself,\" she answered. \"You'll have to learn to play  like other children does when they haven't got sisters and brothers. Our  Dickon goes off on th' moor by himself an' plays for hours. That's how  he made friends with th' pony. He's got sheep on th' moor that knows  him, an' birds as comes an' eats out of his hand. However little there  is to eat, he always saves a bit o' his bread to coax his pets.\"    It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out,  though she was not aware of it. There would be birds outside though  there would not be ponies or sheep. They would be different from the  birds in India and it might amuse her to look at them.    Martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots  and she showed her her way down-stairs.    \"If tha' goes round that way tha'll come to th' gardens,\" she said,  pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery. \"There's lots o' flowers in  summer-time, but there's nothin' bloomin' now.\" She seemed to hesitate a  second before she added, \"One of th' gardens is locked up. No one has  been in it for ten years.\"    \"Why?\" asked Mary in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1740"],[0,"The Flying U's Last Stand (#5)"],[1,"pointed out relentlessly.    \"I wasn't 'zactly scared,\" amended the Kid gravely. \"He was havin' such  a good time, and he was swimmin' around so--comf'table--and it wasn't  polite to 'sturb him. Can't I have Silver?\"    \"We'll go down and ask Silver what he thinks about it,\" said the Little  Doctor, anxious to make peace between her two idols. \"And we'll see if  Daddy Chip can get the hat. You must wear a hat, honey; you know what  mother told you--and you know mother keeps her word.\"    \"I wish dad did,\" the Kid commented, passing over the hat question. \"He  said I could have Silver, and keep him in a box stall and feed him my  own self and water him my own self and nobody's to touch him but me.\"    \"Well, if daddy said all that--we'll have to think it over, and consult  Silver and see what he has to say about it.\"    Silver, when consulted, professed at least a willingness to own the Kid  for his master. He did indeed come trotting up for sugar; and when he  had eaten two grimy lumps from the Kid's grimier hand, he permitted  the Kid to entice him up to a high rock, and stood there while the Kid  clambered upon the rock and from there to his sleek back. He even waited  until the Kid gathered a handful of silky mane and kicked him on the  ribs; then he started off at a lope, while the Kid risked his balance  to cast a triumphant grin--that had a gap in the middle--back at his  astonished parents.    \"Look how the little devil guides him!\" exclaimed Chip surrenderingly.  \"I guess he's safe enough, old Silver seems to sabe he's got a kid to  take care of. He sure would strike a different gait with me! Lord how  the time slides by; I can't seem to get it through me that the Kid's  growing up.\"    The Little Doctor sighed a bit. And the Kid, circling grandly on the far  side of the little pasture, came galloping back to hear the verdict. It  pleased him--though he was inclined to mistake a great privilege for a  right that must not be denied. He commanded his Daddy Chip to open the  gate for him so he could ride Silver to the stable and put him in the  box stall; which was a superfluous kindness, as Chip tried to point out  and failed to make convincing.    The Kid wanted Silver in the box stall, where he could feed him and  water him his own self. So into the box stall Silver reluctantly went,  and spent a greater part of the day with his head stuck out through the  window, staring enviously at his mates in the pasture.    For several days Chip watched the Kid covertly whenever his small feet  strayed stableward; watched and was full of secret pride at the manner  in which the Kid rose to his new responsibility. Never did a \"string\"  receive the care which Silver got, and never did rider sit more proudly  upon his steed than did the Kid sit upon Silver. There seemed to be  practically no risk--Chip was amazed at the Kid's ability to ride.  Besides, Silver was growing old--fourteen years being considered ripe  old age in a horse. He was more given to taking life with a placid  optimism that did not startle easily. He carried the Kid's light weight  easily, and he had not lost all his springiness of muscle. The Little  Doctor rode him sometimes, and loved his smooth gallop and his even  temper; now she loved him more when she saw how careful he was of the  Kid. She besought the Kid to be careful of Silver also, and was most  manfully snubbed for her solicitude.    The Kid had owned Silver for a week, and considered that he was  qualified to give advice to the Happy Family, including his Daddy Chip,  concerning the proper care of horses. He stood with his hands upon his  hips and his feet far apart, and spat into the corral dust and told  Big Medicine that nobody but a pilgrim ever handled a horse the way  Big Medicine was handling Deuce. Whereat Big Medicine gave a bellowing  haw-haw-haw and choked it suddenly when he saw that the Kid desired him  to take the criticism seriously.    \"All right, Buck,\" he acceded humbly, winking openly at the Native Son.  \"I'll try m'best, old-timer. Trouble with me is, I never had nobody to  learn me how to handle a hoss.\"    \"Well, you've got me, now,\" Buck returned calmly. \"I don't ride MY  string without brushing the hay out of his tail. There's a big long  hay stuck in your horse's tail.\" He pointed an accusing finger, and Big  Medicine silently edged close to Douce's rump and very carefully removed  the big, long hay. He took a fine chance of getting himself kicked, but  he did not tell the Kid that.    \"That all right now, Buck?\" Big Medicine wanted to know, when he had  accomplished the thing without accident.    \"Oh, it'll do,\" was the frugal praise he got. \"I've got to go and feed  my string, now. And after a while I'll water him. You want to feed your  horse always before you water him, 'cause eatin' makes him firsty. You  'member that, now.\"    \"I'll sure try to, Buck,\" Big Medicine promised soberly, and watched the  Kid go striding away with his hat tilted at the approved Happy-Family  angle and his small hands in his pockets. Big Medicine was thinking of  his own kid, and wondering what he was like, and if he remembered his  dad. He waved his hand in cordial farewell when the Kid looked back  and wrinkled his nose in the adorable, Little-Doctor smile he had, and  turned his attention to Deuce.    The Kid made straight for the box stall and told Silver hello over the  half door. Silver turned from gazing out of the window, and came  forward expectantly, and the Kid told him to wait a minute and not be so  impatience Then he climbed upon a box, got down a heavy canvas nose-bag  with leather bottom, and from a secret receptacle behind the oats box he  brought a paper bag of sugar and poured about a teacupful into the bag.  Daddy Chip had impressed upon him what would be the tragic consequences  if he fed oats to Silver five times a day. Silver would die, and it  would be the Kid that killed him. Daddy Chip had not said anything about  sugar being fatal, however, and the Countess could not always stand  guard over the sugar sack. So Silver had a sweet taste in his mouth  twelve hours of the twenty-four, and was getting a habit of licking his  lips reminiscently during the other twelve.    The Kid had watched the boys adjust nose bags ever since he could  toddle. He lugged it into the stall, set it artfully upon the floor and  let Silver thrust in his head to the eyes: then he pulled the strap over  Silver's neck and managed to buckle it very securely. He slapped the  sleek neck afterward as his Daddy Chip did, hugged it the way Doctor  Dell did, and stood back to watch Silver revel in the bag.    \"'S good lickums?\" he asked gravely, because he had once heard his  mother ask Silver that very question, in almost that very tone.    At that moment an uproar outside caught his youthful attention. He  listened a minute, heard Pink's voice and a shout of laughter, and ran  to see what was going on; for where was excitement, there the Kid was  also, as nearly in the middle of it as he could manage. His going would  not have mattered to Silver, had he remembered to close the half-door of  the stall behind him; even that would not have mattered, had he not left  the outer door of the stable open also.    The cause of the uproar does not greatly matter, except that the Kid  became so rapturously engaged in watching the foolery of the Happy  Family that he forgot all about Silver. And since sugar produces thirst,  and Silver had not smelled water since morning, he licked the last sweet  grain from the inside of the nose bag and then walked out of the stall  and the stable and made for the creek--and a horse cannot drink with  a nose bag fastened over his face. All he can do, if he succeeds in  getting his nose into the water, is to drown himself most expeditiously  and completely.    Silver reached the creek unseen, sought the deepest hole and tried to  drink. Since his nose was covered with the bag he could not do so but he  fussed and splashed and thrust his head deeper until the water ran into  the bag from the top. He backed and snorted and strangled, and in a  minute he fell. Fortunately he struggled a little, and in doing so he  slid backward down the bank so that his head was up the slope a and the  water ran out of the bag, which was all that saved him.    He was a dead horse, to all appearances at least, when Slim spied him  and gave a yell to bring every human being on the ranch at a run. The  Kid came with the rest, gave one scream and hid his face in the Little  Doctor's skirts, and trembled so that his mother was more frightened  for him than for the horse, and had Chip carry him to the house where he  could not watch the first-aid efforts of the Happy Family.    They did not say anything, much. By their united strength they pulled  Silver up the bank so that his limp head hung downward. Then they began  to work over him exactly as if he had been a drowned man, except that  they did not, of course, roll him over a barrel. They moved his legs  backward and forward, they kneaded his paunch, they blew into his  nostrils, they felt anxiously for heart-beats. They sweated and gave up  the fight, saying that it was no use. They saw a quiver of the muscles  over the chest and redoubled their efforts, telling one another  hopefully that he was alive, all right. They saw finally a quiver of the  nostrils as well, and one after another they laid palms upon his heart,  felt there a steady beating and proclaimed the fact profanely.    They pulled him then into a more comfortable position where the sun  shone warmly and stood around him in a crude circle and watched for  more pronounced symptoms of recovery, and sent word to the Kid that his  string was going to be all right in a little while.    The information was lost upon the Kid, who wept hysterically in his  Daddy Chip's arms listen to anything they told him. He had seen Silver  stretched out dead, with his back in the edge "]]]
