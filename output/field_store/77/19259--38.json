At the very outset of this attack he  and his associates found themselves up against an unexpected and very  difficult proposition....    At first Mrs. Britling had listened to Mr. Direck with an almost  undivided attention, but as he had developed his opening the feast upon  the blue linen table had passed on to a fresh phase that demanded more  and more of her directive intelligence. The two little boys appeared  suddenly at her elbows. \"Shall we take the plates and get the  strawberries, Mummy?\" they asked simultaneously. Then one of the neat  maids in the background had to be called up and instructed in  undertones, and Mr. Direck saw that for the present Robinson's  illuminating experience was not for her ears. A little baffled, but  quite understanding how things were, he turned to his neighbour on his  left....    The girl really had an extraordinarily pretty smile, and there was  something in her soft bright brown eye--like the movement of some quick  little bird. And--she was like somebody he knew! Indeed she was. She was  quite ready to be spoken to.    \"I was telling Mrs. Britling,\" said Mr. Direck, \"what a very great  privilege I esteem it to meet Mr. Britling in this highly familiar way.\"    \"You've not met him before?\"    \"I missed him by twenty-four hours when he came through Boston on the  last occasion. Just twenty-four hours. It was a matter of very great  regret to me.\"    \"I wish I'd been paid to travel round the world.\"    \"You must write things like Mr. Britling and then Mr. Kahn will send  you.\"    \"Don't you think if I promised well?\"    \"You'd have to write some promissory notes, I think--just to convince  him it was all right.\"    The young lady reflected on Mr. Britling's good fortune.    \"He saw India. He saw Japan. He had weeks in Egypt. And he went right  across America.\"    Mr. Direck had already begun on the liner to adapt himself to the  hopping inconsecutiveness of English conversation. He made now what he  felt was quite a good hop, and he dropped his voice to a confidential  undertone. (It was probably Adam in his first conversation with Eve, who  discovered the pleasantness of dropping into a confidential undertone  beside a pretty ear with a pretty wave of hair above it.)    \"It was in India, I presume,\" murmured Mr. Direck, \"that Mr. Britling  made the acquaintance of the coloured gentleman?\"    \"Coloured gentleman!\" She gave a swift glance down the table as though  she expected to see something purple with yellow spots. \"Oh, that is one  of Mr. Lawrence Carmine's young men!\" she explained even more  confidentially and with an air of discussing the silver bowl of roses  before him. \"He's a great authority on Indian literature, he belongs to  a society for making things pleasant for Indian students in London, and  he has them down.\"    \"And Mr. Lawrence Carmine?\" he pursued.    Even more intimately and confidentially she indicated Mr. Carmine, as it  seemed by a motion of her eyelash.    Mr. Direck prepared to be even more _sotto-voce_ and to plumb a much  profounder mystery. His eye rested on the perambulator; he leant a  little nearer to the ear.... But the strawberries interrupted him.    \"Strawberries!\" said the young lady, and directed his regard to his left  shoulder by a little movement of her head.    He found one of the boys with a high-piled plate ready to serve him.    And then Mrs. Britling resumed her conversation with him. She was so  ignorant, she said, of things American, that she did not even know if  they had strawberries there. At any rate, here they were at the crest of  the season, and in a very good year. And in the rose season too. It was  one of the dearest vanities of English people to think their apples and  their roses and their strawberries the best in the world.    \"And their complexions,\" said Mr. Direck, over the pyramid of fruit,  quite manifestly intending a compliment. So that was all right.... But  the girl on the left of him was speaking across the table to the German  tutor, and did not hear what he had said. So that even if it wasn't  very neat it didn't matter....    Then he remembered that she was like that old daguerreotype of a cousin  of his grandmother's that he had fallen in love with when he was a boy.  It was her smile. Of course! Of course!... And he'd sort of adored that  portrait.... He felt a curious disposition to tell her as much....    \"What makes this visit even more interesting if possible to me,\" he said  to Mrs. Britling, \"than it would otherwise be, is that this Essex  country is the country in which my maternal grandmother was raised, and  also long way back my mother's father's people. My mother's father's  people were very early New England people indeed.... Well, no. If I said  _Mayflower_ it wouldn't be true. But it would approximate. They were  Essex Hinkinsons. That's what they were. I must be a good third of me at  least Essex. My grandmother was an Essex Corner, I must confess I've had  some thought--\"    \"Corner?\" said the young lady at his elbow sharply.    \"I was telling Mrs. Britling I had some thought--\"    \"But about those Essex relatives of yours?\"    \"Well, of finding if they were still about in these parts.... Say! I  haven't dropped a brick, have I?\"    He looked from one face to another.    \"_She's_ a Corner,\" said Mrs. Britling.    \"Well,\" said Mr. Direck, and hesitated for a moment. It was so  delightful that one couldn't go on being just discreet. The atmosphere  was free and friendly. His intonation disarmed offence. And he gave the  young lady the full benefit of a quite expressive eye. \"I'm very pleased  to meet you, Cousin Corner. How are the old folks at home?\"      Section 10    The bright interest of this consulship helped Mr. Direck more than  anything to get the better of his Robinson-anecdote crave, and when  presently he found his dialogue with Mr. Britling resumed, he turned at  once to this remarkable discovery of his long lost and indeed hitherto  unsuspected relative. \"It's an American sort of thing to do, I suppose,\"  he said apologetically, \"but I almost thought of going on, on Monday, to  Market Saffron, which was the locality of the Hinkinsons, and just  looking about at the tombstones in the churchyard for a day or so.\"    \"Very probably,\" said Mr. Britling, \"you'd find something about them in  the parish registers. Lots of our registers go back three hundred years  or more. I'll drive you over in my lil' old car.\"    \"Oh! I wouldn't put you to that trouble,\" said Mr. Direck hastily.    \"It's no trouble. I like the driving. What I have had of it. And while  we're at it, we'll come back by Harborough High Oak and look up the  Corner pedigree. They're all over that district still. And the road's  not really difficult; it's only a bit up and down and roundabout.\"    \"I couldn't think, Mr. Britling, of putting you to that much trouble.\"    \"It's no trouble. I want a day off, and I'm dying to take Gladys--\"    \"Gladys?\" said Mr. Direck with sudden hope.    \"That's my name for the lil' car. I'm dying to take her for something  like a decent run. I've only had her out four times altogether, and I've  not got her up yet to forty miles. Which I'm told she ought to do  easily. We'll consider that settled.\"    For the moment Mr. Direck couldn't think of any further excuse. But it  was very clear in his mind that something must happen; he wished he knew  of somebody who could send a recall telegram from London, to prevent him  committing himself to the casual destinies of Mr. Britling's car again.  And then another interest became uppermost in his mind.    \"You'd hardly believe me,\" he said, \"if I told you that that Miss Corner  of yours has a quite extraordinary resemblance to a miniature I've got  away there in America of a cousin of my maternal grandmother's. She  seems a very pleasant young lady.\"    But Mr. Britling supplied no further information about Miss Corner.    \"It must be very interesting,\" he said, \"to come over here and pick up  these American families of yours on the monuments and tombstones. You  know, of course, that district south of Evesham where every other church  monument bears the stars and stripes, the arms of departed Washingtons.  I doubt though if you'll still find the name about there. Nor will you  find many Hinkinsons in Market Saffron. But lots of this country here  has five or six hundred-year-old families still flourishing. That's why  Essex is so much more genuinely Old England than Surrey, say, or Kent.  Round here you'll find Corners and Fairlies, and then you get Capels,  and then away down towards Dunmow and Braintree Maynards and Byngs. And  there are oaks and hornbeams in the park about Claverings that have  echoed to the howling of wolves and the clank of men in armour. All the  old farms here are moated--because of the wolves. Claverings itself is  Tudor, and rather fine too. And the cottages still wear thatch....\"    He reflected. \"Now if you went south of London instead of northward it's  all different. You're in a different period, a different society. You're  in London suburbs right down to the sea. You'll find no genuine estates  left, not of our deep-rooted familiar sort. You'll find millionaires and  that sort of people, sitting in the old places. Surrey is full of rich  stockbrokers, company-promoters, bookies, judges, newspaper proprietors.  Sort of people who fence the paths across their parks. They do something  to the old places--I don't know what they do--but instantly the  countryside becomes a villadom. And little sub-estates and red-brick  villas and art cottages spring up. And a kind of new, hard neatness. And  pneumatic tyre and automobile spirit advertisements, great glaring  boards by the roadside. And all the poor people are inspected and rushed  about until they forget who their grandfathers were.

Somehow the story of the night meeting leaked out, with the result  that persecution was redoubled, and many of the less wealthy followers  were forced to flee to Medinah. They were there well received and  cared for, and were afterwards honoured by being designated the  \"refugees,\" while those who received them were similarly honoured in  being named the \"helpers.\" Thus the brotherhood of believers insisted  on by Mohammed began to assume practical form, and men of different  tribes were united in one common bond--a brotherhood so powerful that  its enemies in Mecca were filled with alarm. They had no longer to  deal with a man whose views could be despised. They were menaced by a  growing force that threatened to overwhelm them. Steps were taken to  overthrow the danger, and elaborate arrangements were made for the  assassination of the prophet. He somehow obtained news of the plot,  and escaped the would-be murderers, who came while he was supposed to  be in bed, by climbing through a window. Accompanied by the faithful  Abu Bakr and a few of his more intimate followers, he made his way to  one of the mountain caves, where he stayed until the immediate danger  had passed. Then the little company commenced the journey to Medinah,  a task so fraught with danger and hardship that Mohammed shrank from  it, in spite of the Meccan evil, and was compelled to attempt it only  by the pressure of his friends.    The facts concerning his entry into Medinah are obscure and uncertain,  but there is no doubt that his advent was hailed with delight by the  \"helpers\" and \"refugees.\" Hospitality was freely offered, and, owing  to the prophet's independent spirit, reluctantly accepted. One of his  earliest actions after arrival was to consolidate his forces by  strengthening the brotherhood, making the obligations of his followers  to one another, and himself, more binding than the ties of blood.          IV.--GROWTH AND PROGRESS.      He now found himself the acknowledged head of a large growing community,  which looked to him for guidance in all its affairs--religious, social,  and political. Proudly, and with true Eastern despotism, he took upon  himself the dignities of prophet, priest, and king. He needed no one with  whom to share these functions. His was the sole right--his alone. His  ambitions were being realised. The striving of years, the disappointment,  doubts, and fears that had so tormented him were well repaid, and could be  forgotten in the glamour that now surrounded him. Enthusiastic and  fanatical votaries crowded around him with loyal acclamation. Pampered and  petted with excessive adulation, can it be wondered that he had visions of  power hitherto undreamed of? His scheme of national reform paled into  insignificance in the light of possibility. He saw himself the leader of a  world-wide conquest--the promoter of a prodigious scheme of universal  reform. He was not merely the messenger of the Arab people, but the  mouthpiece of God to the whole wide world. And by the Divine Power that  possessed him would receive the humble homage of proud and mighty nations,  whose haughty monarchs would bow in lowly submission to his imperious  will! Prophetic insight, regal authority, judicial administration were his  by divine right, to be enforced, if needs be, at the point of the Islamic  sword.    As his position improved, so his ideals deteriorated. His early piety  was modified by the lust of worldly power. In place of patient pacific  methods of propagation, he adopted a cruel, ruthless, warlike policy,  and it was not long--perhaps owing to the extreme poverty which  afflicted the new community--before the would-be prophet became the  leader of a robber host. Yet even in spite of the glamour that  surrounded him, and the questionable behaviour that characterised this  period of his life, we catch occasional glimpses of that which reveals  the working of nobler instincts in his mind. Had his environment been  other than it was, Mohammed had been indeed a hero in the world's  history. Ignorance of truth led him to place himself under the  mysterious power of hallucination. The lonely brooding of the cave had  produced that which had urged him into a position of bondage. He was  the slave of a false idea, which so possessed him that he pressed  onward, in spite of all that stood in his way, whether it was good or  bad. It exerted an irresistible influence over all his impulses,  leading him into actions in every way indefensible. When fair means  failed, he adopted foul, and so succeeded beyond his highest dreams.    The first Mosque, or meeting place, was built very soon after his  arrival in Medinah, and he entered upon his priestly functions. As a  matter of policy, he adopted many of the Jewish rites. These, however,  he soon changed, for as the number of his followers increased, and he  grew more and more independent of Jewish aid, he made every effort to  show his natural aversion to the ancient people, who scorned his  prophetic pretensions. In place of praying towards Jerusalem, his  followers were commanded to turn their faces towards Mecca. The Fast  of Atonement was abolished in favour of the month of Ramadan, while in  substitution for the Jewish rite of sacrifice, the pagan slaying of  victims was observed.    A considerable difference is to be noticed between the \"revelations\"  of this period and those of Mecca. The latter were concerned with  denunciations of idolatry; proofs of the Divine unity and attributes;  legendary stories, and occasional lurid pictures of heaven and hell.  The former are generally of a legislative character, mingled with the  domestic affairs of the prophet, and guidance as to his military  policy. The method of recording them, too, seems to have been  systematised, for it is certain that a body of professional scribes  were engaged in this work, and evidence is not wanting to show that  these scribes were allowed to express the revelations in their own  particular style. Discrepancies and inconsistencies abounded, but  Mohammed seems to have allowed that he was not responsible, and to  have stated that God had a perfect right to alter as He pleased, and  even to apologise for errors! The policy of abrogation has its  sanction in the text, \"Whatever verses we cancel or cause thee to  forget, we give thee better in their stead, or the like thereof.\"    In his warlike policy, the prophet's strategy reflects most  discreditably upon his character, everything that was honourable and  virtuous being sacrificed to the passion for conquest. When he needed  help, he pretended friendship to those he hated; and then, becoming  strong enough to be independent, did not hesitate, upon the slightest  provocation or pretext, to turn his sword against them. This is  particularly true of his treatment of the Jews, whom he at first  befriended, but afterwards treated with barbarous injustice.    Within a very few months of their arrival in Medinah, the need of some  method of support, other than the charity of the helpers, presented  itself. The number of refugees was still increasing, and the demand  for the ordinary necessities of life exceeded the supply. Mohammed, to  his credit, shared the misery of his followers, and proved himself to  be generous even when in want. In order to meet the need, the policy  of despoiling the wealthy Meccan caravans was conceived, and carried  out with some degree of success. The prophet at first exhibited a  feeling of repugnance against such warfare, especially when the  ancient pacific regulations of certain sacred months were violated.  But the benefits of the revenue accruing led him, some time  afterwards, to produce revelations sanctioning hostilities even in the  sacred months. The early successes provided the community with more  wealth than was needed, and, arousing the avarice of many of those who  were opposed to the prophet, led them to throw in their lot with him.  Having seared his conscience by acknowledging the righteousness of the  robber policy, it was easy for him to persuade himself that it was all  part of the purpose of God to prosper his claims. All who would not  acknowledge him were the enemies of God, and had no rights to property  or to life. He began to preach the holiness of war against all  unbelievers. He fanned the avaricious fanaticism of his followers into  a flame of religious enthusiasm, and they became soldier priests,  whose deaths on the battlefield were glorious martyrdoms, which gave  them immediate entrance into a paradise where all their inclinations  could be indulged to an unlimited degree. It is not to be wondered  that an army of such men could put three times their number of Meccans  not so inspired to flight. This is what actually happened in the  battle of Badr. Mohammed had received news of the possibility of  capturing a particularly rich Meccan caravan, and decided to make the  attempt. News of his plans reached the Meccans, who determined to  frustrate, if possible, the designs of their enemy. A thousand men  were rapidly organised into a defensive and punitive force, and sent  out to overwhelm the three hundred Moslems. They were by no means  skilled in military strategy, little better than a disorderly horde;  whereas the Moslems, under the masterly guidance of Mohammed, seem to  have exhibited clever organisation. It has been said that the rigid  prayer ritual enforced by Mohammed, at the risk of Divine punishment,  had a disciplinary effect, and produced results very similar to those  obtained by military drill. The Meccan host was put to flight,  discipline, and steadfastness of purpose determined"]]]
