They are neither clever nor ambitious: they  simply covet money. Alberic's gold: that is their demand, or else Freia,  as agreed upon, whom they now carry off as hostage, leaving Wotan to  consider their ultimatum.    Freia gone, the gods begin to wither and age: her golden apples, which  they so lightly bargained away, they now find to be a matter of life and  death to them; for not even the gods can live on Law and Godhead alone,  be their castles ever so splendid. Loki alone is unaffected: the Lie,  with all its cunning wonders, its glistenings and shiftings and mirages,  is a mere appearance: it has no body and needs no food. What is Wotan  to do? Loki sees the answer clearly enough: he must bluntly rob Alberic.  There is nothing to prevent him except moral scruple; for Alberic, after  all, is a poor, dim, dwarfed, credulous creature whom a god can outsee  and a lie can outwit. Down, then, Wotan and Loki plunge into the mine  where Alberic's slaves are piling up wealth for him under the invisible  whip.    Third Scene    This gloomy place need not be a mine: it might just as well be a  match-factory, with yellow phosphorus, phossy jaw, a large dividend, and  plenty of clergymen shareholders. Or it might be a whitelead factory,  or a chemical works, or a pottery, or a railway shunting yard, or a  tailoring shop, or a little gin-sodden laundry, or a bakehouse, or a big  shop, or any other of the places where human life and welfare are daily  sacrificed in order that some greedy foolish creature may be able to  hymn exultantly to his Platonic idol:    Thou mak'st me eat whilst others starve, And sing while others do  lament: Such untome Thy blessings are, As if I were Thine only care.    In the mine, which resounds with the clinking anvils of the dwarfs  toiling miserably to heap up treasure for their master, Alberic has set  his brother Mime--more familiarly, Mimmy--to make him a helmet. Mimmy  dimly sees that there is some magic in this helmet, and tries to keep  it; but Alberic wrests it from him, and shows him, to his cost, that it  is the veil of the invisible whip, and that he who wears it can appear  in what shape he will, or disappear from view altogether. This helmet is  a very common article in our streets, where it generally takes the form  of a tall hat. It makes a man invisible as a shareholder, and changes  him into various shapes, such as a pious Christian, a subscriber to  hospitals, a benefactor of the poor, a model husband and father, a  shrewd, practical independent Englishman, and what not, when he is  really a pitiful parasite on the commonwealth, consuming a great deal,  and producing nothing, feeling nothing, knowing nothing, believing  nothing, and doing nothing except what all the rest do, and that only  because he is afraid not to do it, or at least pretend to do it.    When Wotan and Loki arrive, Loki claims Alberic as an old acquaintance.  But the dwarf has no faith in these civil strangers: Greed instinctively  mistrusts Intellect, even in the garb of Poetry and the company of  Godhead, whilst envying the brilliancy of the one and the dignity of the  other. Alberic breaks out at them with a terrible boast of the power now  within his grasp. He paints for them the world as it will be when his  dominion over it is complete, when the soft airs and green mosses of  its valleys shall be changed into smoke, slag, and filth; when slavery,  disease, and squalor, soothed by drunkenness and mastered by the  policeman's baton, shall become the foundation of society; and when  nothing shall escape ruin except such pretty places and pretty women as  he may like to buy for the slaking of his own lusts. In that kingdom of  evil he sees that there will be no power but his own. These gods, with  their moralities and legalities and intellectual subtlety, will go under  and be starved out of existence. He bids Wotan and Loki beware of  it; and his \"Hab' Acht!\" is hoarse, horrible, and sinister. Wotan  is revolted to the very depths of his being: he cannot stifle the  execration that bursts from him. But Loki is unaffected: he has no moral  passion: indignation is as absurd to him as enthusiasm. He finds it  exquisitely amusing--having a touch of the comic spirit in him--that the  dwarf, in stirring up the moral fervor of Wotan, has removed his last  moral scruple about becoming a thief. Wotan will now rob the dwarf  without remorse; for is it not positively his highest duty to take this  power out of such evil hands and use it himself in the interests of  Godhead? On the loftiest moral grounds, he lets Loki do his worst.    A little cunningly disguised flattery makes short work of Alberic. Loki  pretends to be afraid of him; and he swallows that bait unhesitatingly.  But how, enquires Loki, is he to guard against the hatred of his million  slaves? Will they not steal from him, whilst he sleeps, the magic ring,  the symbol of his power, which he has forged from the gold of the Rhine?  \"You think yourself very clever,\" sneers Alberic, and then begins to  boast of the enchantments of the magic helmet. Loki refuses to believe  in such marvels without witnessing them. Alberic, only too glad to  show off his powers, puts on the helmet and transforms himself into a  monstrous serpent. Loki gratifies him by pretending to be frightened out  of his wits, but ventures to remark that it would be better still if the  helmet could transform its owner into some tiny creature that could hide  and spy in the smallest cranny. Alberic promptly transforms himself  into a toad. In an instant Wotan's foot is on him; Loki tears away the  helmet; they pinion him, and drag him away a prisoner up through the  earth to the meadow by the castle.    Fourth Scene    There, to pay for his freedom, he has to summon his slaves from the  depths to place all the treasure they have heaped up for him at the feet  of Wotan. Then he demands his liberty; but Wotan must have the ring  as well. And here the dwarf, like the giant before him, feels the very  foundations of the world shake beneath him at the discovery of his  own base cupidity in a higher power. That evil should, in its loveless  desperation, create malign powers which Godhead could not create, seems  but natural justice to him. But that Godhead should steal those malign  powers from evil, and wield them itself, is a monstrous perversion; and  his appeal to Wotan to forego it is almost terrible in its conviction  of wrong. It is of no avail. Wotan falls back again on virtuous  indignation. He reminds Alberic that he stole the gold from the  Rhine maidens, and takes the attitude of the just judge compelling a  restitution of stolen goods. Alberic knowing perfectly well that the  judge is taking the goods to put them in his own pocket, has the ring  torn from his finger, and is once more as poor as he was when he came  slipping and stumbling among the slimy rocks in the bed of the Rhine.    This is the way of the world. In older times, when the Christian laborer  was drained dry by the knightly spendthrift, and the spendthrift was  drained by the Jewish usurer, Church and State, religion and law, seized  on the Jew and drained him as a Christian duty. When the forces of  lovelessness and greed had built up our own sordid capitalist systems,  driven by invisible proprietorship, robbing the poor, defacing the  earth, and forcing themselves as a universal curse even on the generous  and humane, then religion and law and intellect, which would never  themselves have discovered such systems, their natural bent being  towards welfare, economy, and life instead of towards corruption, waste,  and death, nevertheless did not scruple to seize by fraud and force  these powers of evil on presence of using them for good. And it  inevitably happens that when the Church, the Law, and all the Talents  have made common cause to rob the people, the Church is far more  vitally harmed by that unfaithfulness to itself than its more mechanical  confederates; so that finally they turn on their discredited ally and  rob the Church, with the cheerful co-operation of Loki, as in France and  Italy for instance.    The twin giants come back with their hostage, in whose presence Godhead  blooms again. The gold is ready for them; but now that the moment has  come for parting with Freia the gold does not seem so tempting; and  they are sorely loth to let her go. Not unless there is gold enough to  utterly hide her from them--not until the heap has grown so that they  can see nothing but gold--until money has come between them and every  human feeling, will they part with her. There is not gold enough to  accomplish this: however cunningly Loki spreads it, the glint of Freia's  hair is still visible to Giant Fafnir, and the magic helmet must go on  the heap to shut it out. Even then Fafnir's brother, Fasolt, can catch a  beam from her eye through a chink, and is rendered incapable thereby of  forswearing her. There is nothing to stop that chink but the ring; and  Wotan is as greedily bent on keeping that as Alberic himself was; nor  can the other gods persuade him that Freia is worth it, since for  the highest god, love is not the highest good, but only the universal  delight that bribes all living things to travail with renewed life. Life  itself, with its accomplished marvels and its infinite potentialities,  is the only force that Godhead can worship. Wotan does not yield until  he is reached by the voice of the fruitful earth that before he or the  dwarfs or the giants or the Law or the Lie or any of these things were,  had the seed of them all in her bosom, and the seed perhaps of something  higher even than himself, that shall one day supersede him and cut the  tangles and alliances and compromises that already have cost him one  of his eyes.

Lucy signed to the nurse to take the babe, and as the woman walked away  with it in her arms, turned eagerly to her friend.    \"Now do tell me; for I'm sure you are not going to live single. Shall we  have the pleasure of hailing you as duchess yet?\"    \"No, Lucy; I intend to marry; am actually engaged, but not to a  foreigner.\"    \"Dear me! I don't believe I could have resisted the title. That is,\" she  added, hastily, \"if I'd been heart-whole like you: but after seeing my  Phil, of course I wouldn't give him up for all the nobles in Europe, Asia,  and Africa. But do tell me who is the fortunate man?\"    \"Suppose you try your skill at guessing.\"    \"Perfectly useless, never had any. It must be somebody I don't know.\"    \"My good little woman, you know him well.\"    \"Either of Harry's brothers-in-law? Richard? Harold?\"    \"No, no, no; you are wide of the mark! Could you suppose papa would ever  consent to such a mixture of relationships? Why, it would make papa my  brother and mamma's brother her son-in-law.\"    \"So it would. Well, I give it up and beg of you to put a speedy end to my  suspense.\"    Lucy bent her head to listen, and Elsie murmured the name low and softly,  the rose deepening on her cheek as she spoke. For a moment Lucy seemed  struck dumb with astonishment. Then, \"Elsie!\" she exclaimed, \"I can't  believe it; you are only jesting.\"    Elsie shook her head with a low, musical, happy laugh.    \"He's splendid, I don't deny that; but then--only think--your father's  most intimate friend from boyhood up; and almost as old.\"    \"Some people seem like wine--to improve with age. But Mr. Travilla is not  old to me now. He has been standing still, I believe, while I have grown  up to him.\"    \"And you really are in love with him?\"    \"He has all my heart, all the love I could give to any one, and I respect,  honor, and trust him as I do no one else but my father.\"    \"And that reminds me; I was so afraid your father would not let you come  to see me. But--you are your own mistress now, of course.\"    \"Papa tells me so sometimes,\" laughed Elsie, \"and yet I know he would be  greatly surprised should I take the liberty of doing anything he would not  approve. I asked his permission to come, and he not only gave consent but  brought me himself.\"    \"That was good in him; but I hope he won't hurry you away. I want to hear  about your European conquests, and have ever so much to say besides.\"    \"No, he has kindly promised me time for a long talk. Besides, I can ride  over any day and supplement it with another.\"    Mr. Dinsmore was as good as his word; their chat had lasted more than an  hour when his summons came, yet Lucy declared it had not been half long  enough, and would not be satisfied to let Elsie go without a promise to  come again very soon.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Roselands, too, looks very natural, and very homelike,\" remarked Mr.  Dinsmore, as they rode up its avenue.    \"Yes, papa; and yet, do you know, it seems to me it has grown smaller and  less grand since I lived here as a child.\"    \"Ah! did you think it very grand then, daughter?\" he asked, turning to her  with a smile.    \"I believe so, papa; but it is beautiful yet, even after all the fine  places we have seen in our own country and Europe.\"    Adelaide met them at the door. \"Just in time,\" she said, \"for there is the  dressing-bell. Your own old room, Elsie dear: you know the way and will  find Aunt Chloe in waiting. Horace, you will make yourself at home of  course.\"    It was strictly a family party, sociable and informal. Elsie had not met  Arthur since their return, and at the first moment scarcely recognized him  in the moustached and bewhiskered young man who rose and came forward,  with a slight limp, to meet her as she entered the drawing-room.    \"How do you do?\" he said, holding out his right hand, while steadying  himself with a cane held in the left. \"I hope you're glad to get back to  America?\"    \"Arthur, is it? Yes; thank you: and I'm very glad your injuries have  proved less serious than was at first feared,\" she said, kindly meeting  his advances half-way.    \"Oh yes,\" he replied, with attempted nonchalance, \"I shall be all right by  and by.\"    Then retreating to the seat from which he had just risen, the corner of a  sofa by the side of his sister Adelaide, his eye following Elsie as she  crossed the room to pay her respects to her grandfather and others. \"What  on earth you call that girl little for, I can't imagine,\" he remarked in  an undertone; \"why she's quite above the average height; graceful as a  young fawn, too; splendid figure, and actually the most beautiful face I  ever saw. I don't wonder she turned the heads of lords and dukes on the  other side of the water. But what _do_ you call her little for?\"    \"I hardly know, Art; with me it's a term of endearment more than anything  else, I believe,\" replied his sister; \"but there is something in the  expression of her face--something that has always been there, a sweet  simplicity and innocence--that moves one to a sort of protecting love as  to a little one who has not yet attained sufficient worldly wisdom to take  care of herself.\"    Old Mr. Dinsmore greeted his lovely granddaughter almost affectionately,  holding her hand in his for a moment, and looking from her to her father.  \"Really, she's a girl to be proud of, Horace,\" he said with a paternal  smile. \"But I've no need to tell you that.\"    \"No, she is not bad looking,\" observed his wife with a slight sneer; \"few  girls would be in such elegant attire; but it surprises me to see that,  with all her advantages and opportunities for improvement, she has not yet  lost that baby expression she always had. She'll never be half the woman  Enna is.\"    The days were past in which the lady mother had gloried in the fact that  anywhere Enna would have been taken for the elder of the two; and now the  contrast between her faded, fretful face and Elsie's fresh bloom was a  sore trial to madam's love, and pride in her household pet.    But no one deemed it necessary to reply to the unpleasant remark. Elsie  only smiled up into her father's face as he came forward and stood at her  side, and meeting his look of loving content and pride in her, just as she  was, and calling to mind how fully satisfied with her was another, whose  loving approbation was no less precious, turned away with a half-breathed  sigh of heartfelt happiness, finished her greetings, and, the dinner-bell  ringing at that moment, accepted Walter's offered arm to the dining-room.    Arthur was more and more charmed with his niece as he noted the modest  ease and grace of her manners, both at the table, and afterwards in the  drawing-room; listened to her music--greatly improved under the  instructions of some of the first masters of Europe--and her conversation  with his father and others, in which she almost unconsciously revealed  rich stores of varied information gathered from books, the discourse of  the wise and learned met in her travels, and her own keen yet kindly  observations of men and things. These, with the elegance of her diction,  and the ready play of wit and fancy, made her a fascinating talker.    Contrary to Elsie's expectations, it was decided by the elders of the  party that all should remain to tea.    As the others returned to the drawing-room on leaving the table, she stole  out upon the moonlighted veranda. Gazing wistfully down the avenue, was  she thinking of one probably even then on his way to the Oaks--thinking of  him and his disappointment at not finding her here?    \"It's a nice night, this,\" remarked Arthur's voice at her side, \"I say,  Elsie, suppose we bury the hatchet, you and I.\"    \"I never had any enmity towards you, Arthur,\" she answered, still gazing  straight before her.    \"Well, it's odd if you hadn't; I gave you cause enough, as you did me by  your niggardly refusal to lend me a small sum, on occasions when I was  hard up. But I'm willing to let by-gones be by-gones, if you are.\"    \"Certainly; I should be glad to forget all that has been unpleasant in the  past.\"    \"You have improved wonderfully since I saw you last: you were a pretty  girl then, but now you are without exception the most superbly beautiful,  graceful, accomplished, and intelligent woman I ever saw.\"    \"I do not like flattery, Arthur,\" she answered, turning coldly away.    \"Pooh! the truth's never flattery; I declare if we were not so nearly  related, I'd marry you myself.\"    \"You forget,\" she said, half scornfully, \"that it takes two to make a  bargain; three in this case; and two of us would never consent.\"    \"Nonsense! I'd soon manage it by clever courting. A man can always get the  woman he wants if he's only sufficiently determined.\"    \"In that you are mistaken. But why broach so disagreeable a subject, since  we are so nearly related that the very thought seems almost a sin and a  crime?\"    \"And so you're going to throw yourself away on old Travilla?\"    Elsie faced him with flashing eyes. \"No; it will be no throwing away of  myself, nor will I allow him to be spoken of in such disrespectful terms,  in my presence.\"    \"Humph!\" laughed Arthur. \"Well, I've found out how to make you angry, at  all events. And I'm free to confess I don't like Travilla, or forgive him  all old scores.\"    Elsie scarcely seemed to hear. A horse was coming at a quiet canter up the  avenue. Both the steed and his rider wore a familiar aspect, and the young  girl's heart gave a joyous bound as the latter dismounted, throwing the  reins to a servant, and came up the steps into the veranda.    She glided towards him; there was an earnest, tender clasping of hands, a  word or two of cordial greeting, and they passed into the house and  entered the drawing room.    \"Humph! not much sentiment there; act"]]]
