Do you work for him?\"    \"No. For the superintendent, Mr. Fryer. But I go to Dick's office to  do letters for him some of the time.\"    She appeared frank and nonchalant, evidently a little proud of her  important position. She posed before Lane and pirouetted with fancy  little steps.    \"Say, Dare, won't you teach me a new dance--right from Paris?\" she  interposed. \"Something that will put the shimmy and toddle out of  biz?\"    \"Lorna, I don't know what the shimmy and toddle are. I've only heard  of them.\"    \"Buried alive, I'll say,\" she retorted.    Lane bit his tongue to keep back a hot reprimand. He looked at his  mother, who was clearing off the supper table. She looked sad. The  light had left her worn face. Lane did not feel sure of his ground  here. So he controlled his feelings and directed his interest toward  more news.    \"Of course Dick Swann was in the service?\" he asked.    \"No. He didn't go,\" replied Lorna.    The information struck Lane singularly. Dick Swann had always been a  prominent figure in the Middleville battery, in those seemingly long  past years since before the war.    \"Why didn't Dick go into the service? Why didn't the draft get him?\"    \"He had poor eyesight, and his father needed him at the iron works.\"    \"Poor eyesight!\" ejaculated Lane. \"He was the best shot in the  battery--the best hunter among the boys. Well, that's funny.\"    \"Daren, there are people who called Dick Swann a slacker,\" returned  Lorna, as if forced to give this information. \"But I never saw that it  hurt him. He's rich now. His uncle left him a million, and his father  will leave him another. And I'll say it's the money people want these  days.\"    The materialism so pregnant in Lorna's half bitter reply checked  Lane's further questioning. He edged closer to the stove, feeling a  little cold. A shadow drifted across the warmth and glow of his mind.  At home now he was to be confronted with a monstrous and insupportable  truth--the craven cowardice of the man who had been eligible to  service in army or navy, and who had evaded it. In camp and trench and  dug-out he had heard of the army of slackers. And of all the vile and  stark profanity which the war gave birth to on the lips of miserable  and maimed soldiers, that flung on the slackers was the worst.    \"I've got a date to go to the movies,\" said Lorna, and she bounced out  of the kitchen into the hall singing:                 \"Oh by heck               You never saw a wreck               Like the wreck she made of me.\"    She went upstairs, while Lane sat there trying to adapt himself to a  new and unintelligible environment. His mother began washing the  dishes. Lane felt her gaze upon his face, and he struggled against all  the weaknesses that beset him.    \"Mother, doesn't Lorna help you with the house work?\" he asked.    \"She used to. But not any more.\"    \"Do you let her go out at night to the movies--dances, and all that?\"    Mrs. Lane made a gesture of helplessness. \"Lorna goes out all the  time. She's never here. She stays out until midnight--one  o'clock--later. She's popular with the boys. I couldn't stop her even  if I wanted to. Girls can't be stopped these days. I do all I can for  her--make her dresses--slave for her--hoping she'll find a good  husband. But the young men are not marrying.\"    \"Good Heavens, are you already looking for a husband for Lorna?\" broke  out Lane.    \"You don't understand, Dare. You've been away so long. Wait till  you've seen what girls--are nowadays. Then you'll not wonder that I'd  like to see Lorna settled.\"    \"Mother, you're right,\" he said, gravely. \"I've been away so--long.  But I'm back home now. I'll soon get on to things. And I'll help you.  I'll take Lorna in hand. I'll relieve you of a whole lot.\"    \"You were always a good boy, Daren, to me and Lorna,\" murmured Mrs.  Lane, almost in tears. \"It's cheered me to get you home, yet.... Oh,  if you were well and strong!\"    \"Never mind, mother. I'll get better,\" he replied, rising to take up  his bag. \"I guess now I'd better go to bed. I'm just about all in....  Wonder how Blair and Red are.\"    His mother followed him up the narrow stairway, talking, trying to  pretend she did not see his dragging steps, his clutch on the  banisters.    \"Your room's just as you left it,\" she said, opening the door. Then on  the threshold she kissed him. \"My son, I thank God you have come home  alive. You give me hope in--in spite of all.... If you need me, call.  Good night.\"    Lane was alone in the little room that had lived in waking and  dreaming thought. Except to appear strangely smaller, it had not  changed. His bed and desk--the old bureau--the few pictures--the  bookcase he had built himself--these were identical with images in his  memory.    A sweet and wonderful emotion of peace pervaded his soul--fulfilment  at last of the soldier's endless longing for home, bed, quiet, rest.    \"If I have to die--I can do it _now_ without hate of all around me,\"  he whispered, in the passion of his spirit.    But as he sat upon his bed, trying with shaking and clumsy hands to  undress himself, that exalted mood flashed by. Some of the dearest  memories of his life were associated with this little room. Here he  had dreamed; here he had read and studied; here he had fought out some  of the poignant battles of youth. So much of life seemed behind him.  At last he got undressed, and extinguishing the light, he crawled into  bed.    The darkness was welcome, and the quiet was exquisitely soothing. He  lay there, staring into the blackness, feeling his body sink slowly as  if weighted. How cool and soft the touch of sheets! Then, the river of  throbbing fire that was his blood, seemed to move again. And the dull  ache, deep in the bones, possessed his nerves. In his breast there  began a vibrating, as if thousands of tiny bubbles were being pricked  to bursting in his lungs. And the itch to cough came back to his  throat. And all his flesh seemed in contention with a slowly ebbing  force. Sleep might come perhaps after pain had lulled. His heart beat  unsteadily and weakly, sometimes with a strange little flutter. How  many weary interminable hours had he endured! But to-night he was too  far spent, too far gone for long wakefulness. He drifted away and sank  as if into black oblivion where there sounded the dreadful roll of  drums, and images moved under gray clouds, and men were running like  phantoms. He awoke from nightmares, wet with cold sweat, and lay  staring again at the blackness, once more alive to recurrent pain.  Pain that was an old, old story, yet ever acute and insistent and  merciless.    The night wore on, hour by hour. The courthouse clock rang out one  single deep mellow clang. One o'clock! Lane thrilled to the sound. It  brought back the school days, the vacation days, the Indian summer  days when the hills were golden and the purple haze hung over the  land--the days that were to be no more for Daren Lane.    In the distance somewhere a motor-car hummed, and came closer, louder  down the street, to slow its sound with sliding creak and jar outside  in front of the house. Lane heard laughter and voices of a party of  young people. Footsteps, heavy and light, came up the walk, and on to  the porch. Lorna was returning rather late from the motion-picture,  thought Lane, and he raised his head from the pillow, to lean toward  the open window, listening.    \"Come across, kiddo,\" said a boy's voice, husky and low.    Lane heard a kiss--then another.    \"Cheese it, you boob!\"    \"Gee, your gettin' snippy. Say, will you ride out to Flesher's  to-morrow night?\"    \"Nothing doing, I've got a date. Good night.\"    The hall door below opened and shut. Footsteps thumped off the porch  and out to the street. Lane heard the giggle of girls, the snap of a  car-door, the creaking of wheels, and then a low hum, dying away.    Lorna came slowly up stairs to enter her room, moving quietly. And  Lane lay on his bed, wide-eyed, staring into the blackness. \"My little  sister,\" he whispered to himself. And the words that had meant so much  seemed a mockery.          CHAPTER III      Lane saw the casement of his window grow gray with the glimmering  light of dawn. After that he slept several hours. When he awoke it was  nine o'clock. The long night with its morbid dreams and thoughts had  passed, and in the sunshine of day he saw things differently.    To move, to get up was not an easy task. It took stern will, and all  the strength of muscle he had left, and when he finally achieved it  there was a clammy dew of pain upon his face. With slow guarded  movements he began to dress himself. Any sudden or violent action  might burst the delicate gassed spots in his lungs or throw out of  place one of the lower vertebrae of his spine. The former meant death,  and the latter bent his body like a letter S and caused such  excruciating agony that it was worse than death. These were his two  ever-present perils. The other aches and pains he could endure.    He shaved and put on clean things, and his best coat, and surveyed  himself in the little mirror. He saw a thin face, white as marble, but  he was not ashamed of it. His story was there to read, if any one had  kind enough eyes to see. What would Helen think of him--and Margaret  Maynard--and Dal--and Mel Iden? Bitter curiosity seemed his strongest  feeling concerning his fiancee. He would hold her as engaged to him  until she informed him she was not. As for the others, thought of  them quickened his interest, especially in Mel. What had happened to  her.    It was going to be wonderful to meet them--and to meet everybody he  had once known. Wonderful because he would see what the war had"]]]
