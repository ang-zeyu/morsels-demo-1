The officer, who came to  release him, was surprised to find him busy in his dungeon over the map  of Lombardy. The \"Representatives,\" however, had certainly taken up a  general prejudice against him; for he did not reassume his functions at  Nice; and seems to have spent some time in obscurity with his own  family, who were then in very distressed circumstances, at Marseilles.  It was here that he fell in love with Mademoiselle Clery, whom, but for  some accident, it appears he would have married. Her sister was shortly  afterwards united to his brother Joseph, and she herself became in the  sequel the wife of Bernadotte, now King of Sweden. It is supposed that  Buonaparte found himself too poor to marry at this time; and  circumstances interfered to prevent any renewal of his proposals.    Before the end of the year he came to Paris to solicit employment; but  at first he met with nothing but repulses. The President of the Military  Committee, Aubry, objected to his youth. \"Presence in the field of  battle,\" said Buonaparte, \"might be reckoned in place of years.\" The  President, who had not seen much actual service, thought he was  insulted, and treated Napoleon very coldly. After a little while,  however, he was asked to go to _La Vendee_, as commandant of a brigade  of infantry. This he declined, alleging, that nothing could reconcile  him to leave the artillery, but really, if we are to follow De  Bourienne, considering the Vendean warfare as unworthy of him. His  refusal was followed by the erasure of his name from the list of general  officers _in employment_; and for a time his fortunes seemed to be in a  desperate condition. He thought of settling in some way in Paris; and  said to Bourienne, that, if he could afford to have a small house in the  street where his school-fellow lived, and to keep a cabriolet, he would  be contented. His elder brother had about this time married Mademoiselle  Clery, whose father, the merchant of Marseilles, gave her a handsome  dowry. \"How fortunate,\" Napoleon would often exclaim, \"is that fool  Joseph!\"[6]    Talma, the celebrated tragedian, was one of his chief associates at this  time, and even then talked with confidence of the future fortunes of  \"little Buonaparte.\" This player's kindness and Aubry's opposition were  both remembered. The Emperor always patronised Talma; and Aubry died in  exile.    Napoleon, despairing of employment at home, now drew up a memorial to  the government, requesting to be sent with a few other officers of  artillery into Turkey, for the purpose of placing that branch of the  Grand Seignior's service in a condition more suitable to the  circumstances of the times--in which it seemed highly probable that the  Porte might find itself in alliance with France, and assaulted by the  combined armies of Russia and Austria. No answer was returned to this  memorial, over which he dreamt for some weeks in great enthusiasm. \"How  strange,\" he said to his friends, \"would it be if a little Corsican  soldier should become King of Jerusalem!\" Go where he might, he already  contemplated greatness.    At length Napoleon was nominated to the command of a brigade of  artillery in Holland. The long-deferred appointment was, no doubt, very  welcome; but in the meantime his services were called for on a nearer  and a more important field.    The French nation were now heartily tired of the National Convention: it  had lost most of its distinguished members in the tumults and  persecutions of the times; and above all it had lost respect by  remaining for two years the slave and the tool of the Terrorists. The  downfall of Robespierre, when it did take place, showed how easily the  same blessed deliverance might have been effected long before, had this  body possessed any sense of firmness or of dignity. Even the restoration  of the members banished by the tyrant did not serve to replace the  Convention in the confidence of the public. They themselves saw clearly  that a new remodelling of the government was called for and must be; and  their anxiety was to devise the means of securing for themselves as  large a share as possible of substantial power, under some arrangement  sufficiently novel in appearance to throw dust in the eyes of the  people.    A great part of the nation, there is no doubt, were at this time anxious  to see the royal family restored, and the government settled on the  model of 1791. Among the more respectable citizens of Paris in  particular such feelings were very prevalent. But many causes conspired  to surround the adoption of this measure with difficulties, which none  of the actually influential leaders had the courage, or perhaps the  means, to encounter. The soldiery of the Republican armies had been  accustomed to fight against the exiled princes and nobility, considered  them as the worst enemies of France, and hated them personally. The  estates of the church, the nobles, and the crown, had been divided and  sold; and the purchasers foresaw that, were the monarchy restored at  this period, the resumption of the forfeited property would be pressed  with all the powers of government. And, lastly, the men who had earned  for themselves most distinction and influence in public affairs, had  excellent reasons for believing that the Bourbons and nobility, if  restored, would visit on their own heads the atrocities of the  Revolution, and above all the murder of the King.    The Conventionalists themselves, however, had learned by this time that  neither peace nor security could be expected, unless some form of  government were adopted, in which the legislative and the executive  functions should at least appear to be separated; and they were also at  length inclined to admit the excellence of that part of the British  constitution, which, dividing the legislatorial power between two  assemblies of senators, thus acquires the advantage of a constant  revision of counsels, and regulates the political machine by a system of  mutual checks and balances. They were desirous, therefore, of proposing  some system which might, in a certain degree, satisfy those who had been  endeavouring to bring about the restoration of the monarchy; and the new  constitution of the year _three_ of the Republic (1795) presented the  following features. I. The executive power was to be lodged in Five  Directors, chosen from time to time, who were to have no share in the  legislation. II. There was to be a Council of Five Hundred, answering  generally to our House of Commons: and III. A smaller assembly, called  the Council of Ancients, intended to fulfil in some measure the purposes  of a House of Peers.    The outline of this scheme might perhaps have been approved of; but the  leading members of the Convention, from views personal to themselves,  appended to it certain conditions which excited new disgust. They  decreed, first, that the electoral bodies of France, in choosing  representatives to the two new Councils, must elect at least two-thirds  of the present members of Convention; and, secondly, that if full  two-thirds were not returned, the Convention should have the right to  supply the deficiency out of their own body. It was obvious that this  machinery had no object but the continuance of the present legislators  in power; and the nation, and especially the superior classes in Paris,  were indignant at conduct which they considered as alike selfish and  arbitrary. The royalist party gladly lent themselves to the diffusion of  any discontents; and a formidable opposition to the measures of the  existing government was organised.    The Convention meantime continued their sittings, and exerting all their  skill and influence, procured from many districts of the country reports  accepting of the New Constitution, with all its conditions. The  Parisians, being nearer and sharper observers, and having abundance of  speakers and writers to inform and animate them, assembled in the  several sections of the city, and proclaimed their hostility to the  Convention and its designs. The National Guard, consisting of armed  citizens, almost unanimously sided with the enemies of the Convention;  and it was openly proposed to march to the Tuileries, and compel a  change of measures by force of arms.    The Convention, perceiving their unpopularity and danger, began to look  about them anxiously for the means of defence. There were in and near  Paris 5000 regular troops, on whom they thought they might rely, and who  of course contemned the National Guard as only half-soldiers. They had  besides some hundreds of artillerymen; and they now organized what they  called \"the Sacred Band,\" a body of 1500 ruffians, the most part of them  old and tried instruments of Robespierre. With these means they prepared  to arrange a plan of defence; and it was obvious that they did not want  materials, provided they could find a skilful and determined head.    The Insurgent Sections placed themselves under the command of _Danican_,  an old general of no great skill or reputation. The Convention opposed  to him _Menou_; and he marched at the head of a column into the section  Le Pelletier to disarm the National Guard of that district--one of the  wealthiest of the capital. The National Guard were found drawn up in  readiness to receive him at the end of the Rue Vivienne; and Menou,  becoming alarmed, and hampered by the presence of some of the  \"Representatives of the People,\" entered into a parley, and retired  without having struck a blow.    The Convention judged that Menou was not master of nerves for such a  crisis; and consulted eagerly about a successor to his command. Barras,  one of their number, had happened to be present at Toulon, and to have  appreciated the character of Buonaparte. He had, probably, been applied  to by Napoleon in his recent pursuit of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#5)"],[1," got permission to come out  in a Red Cross motor-ambulance. I was, of course, delighted to see them,  and with their help we soon settled down into the ordinary routine of  hospital life, and forgot we were prisoners under strict supervision,  having all kinds of tiresome rules and regulations to keep.    The question of supplies was a very difficult one from the first. We  were short of everything, very short of dressings, chloroform and all  kinds of medical supplies, and especially (even worse in one way) very  short of hospital linen such as sheets and towels and shirts and  drawers, and we had the greatest difficulty in getting anyone to come  and wash for us. One might have thought that with almost every one out  of work, there would have been no lack of women; but the hospital was a  long way from the nearest town and I suppose they were afraid to come;  also, of course, many, very many, had had their houses burnt, lost their  all and fled away. The food question was a very difficult one also. We  had to live just from day to day and be thankful for small mercies.  Naturally for ourselves it would not have mattered at all, but it _did_  matter very much for our poor patients, who were nearly all very ill.  Meat was always difficult often impossible to get, and at first there  was no bread, which, personally, I missed more than anything else;  afterwards we got daily rations of this. Butter there was none; eggs and  milk very scarce, only just enough for the very severely wounded.  Potatoes and lentils we had in great quantities, and on that diet one  would never starve, though it was not an ideal one for sick men.    I remember one morning when we had only potatoes for the men's dinner;  the cook had just peeled an immense bucket of them and was putting them  on to boil when some German soldiers came and took the lot, and this so  infuriated the cook that we had to wait hours before we could get  another lot prepared and cooked for the patients' dinner. The  water-supply was another of our difficulties. All the watercourses in  the neighbourhood were polluted with dead bodies of men and horses and  no water was fit to drink. There was a horrible, greenish, foul-smelling  stream near the hospital, which I suppose eventually found its way into  the river, and it sickened me to imagine what we were drinking, even  though it was well boiled.    It was very hot weather and the men all dreadfully thirsty. There was  one poor Breton soldier dying of septicaemia, who lay in a small room off  the large ward. He used to shriek to every passer-by to give him drink,  and no amount of water relieved his raging thirst. That voice calling  incessantly night and day, \"A boire, a boire!\" haunted me long after he  was dead. The taste of long-boiled water is flat and nasty, so we made  weak decoctions of camomile-tea for the men, which they seemed to like  very much. We let it cool, and kept a jug of it on each locker so that  they could help themselves whenever they liked.    Some of the ladies of the town were very kind indeed in bringing in wine  and little delicacies for our sick, and for ourselves, too, sometimes.  We were very grateful to them for all their kindness in the midst of  their own terrible trouble and anxieties.    All the first ten days the cannon boomed without ceasing; by degrees it  got more distant, and we knew the forts of Maubeuge were being bombarded  by the famous German howitzers, which used to shake the hospital to its  foundations. The French soldiers in the wards soon taught us to  distinguish the sounds of the different cannon. In a few days we knew as  well as they did whether it was French or German artillery firing.    Our hospital was on the main Beaumont road, and in the midst of our work  we would sometimes glance out and watch the enormous reinforcements of  troops constantly being sent up. Once we saw a curious sight. Two large  motor-omnibuses with \"Leipziger lokal-anzeiger\" painted on their side  went past, each taking about twenty-five German Beguine nuns to the  battlefield, the contrast between this very modern means of transport  and the archaic appearance of the nuns in their mediaeval dress was very  striking.    Suddenly one Sunday morning the cannonading ceased--there was dead  silence--Maubeuge was taken, and the German army passed on into France.  It is difficult to explain the desolating effect when the cannon  suddenly ceases. At first one fears and hates it, then one gets  accustomed to it and one feels at least _something is being done_--there  is still a chance. When it ceases altogether there is a sense of utter  desertion, as if all hope had been given up.           *       *       *       *       *    On the morning of September 1 the German commandant suddenly appeared in  the wards at 7 o'clock, and said that all the German wounded were going  to be sent off to Germany at once, and that wagons would be coming in an  hour's time to take them to the station. We had several men who were not  fit to travel, amongst them a soldier who had had his leg amputated only  twelve hours before. I ought to have learnt by that time the futility  of argument with a German official, but I pleaded very hard that a few  of the men might be left till they were a little better able to stand  the journey, for there is no nationality among wounded, and we could not  bear even German patients to undergo unnecessary suffering. But my  remonstrances were quite in vain, and one could not help wondering what  would become of _our_ wounded if the Germans treated their own so  harshly. I heard from other ambulances that it was their experience as  well as mine that the lightly wounded were very well looked after, but  the severely wounded were often very inconsiderately treated. They were  no longer any use as fighting machines and only fit for the scrap-heap.  It is all part of the German system. They are out for one purpose only,  that is to win--and they go forward with this one end in  view--everything else, including the care of the wounded, is a  side-issue and must be disregarded and sacrificed if necessary.    We prepared the men as well as we could for the long ride in the wagons  that must precede the still longer train journey. Once on the  ambulance-train, however, they would be well looked after; it was the  jolting on the country road I feared for many of them. None of us were  permitted to accompany them to Charleroi station, but the driver of one  of the wagons told me afterwards that the man with the amputated leg had  been taken out dead at the station, as he had had a severe haemorrhage on  the way, which none of his comrades knew how to treat. He also told us  that all the big hospitals at Charleroi were evacuating their German  wounded, and that he had seen two other men taken out of carts quite  dead. We took this to mean very good news for us, thinking that the  Germans must have had a severe reverse to be taking away their wounded  in such a hurry. So we waited and hoped, but as usual nothing happened  and there was no news.    We had a very joyful free sort of feeling at having got rid of the  German patients. The French soldiers began to sing The Marseillaise as  soon as they had gone, but we were obliged to stop them as we feared the  German doctor or commandant, who were often prowling about, might hear.  Losing so many patients made the work much lighter for the time being,  and about this time, too, several of the severely wounded men died. They  had suffered so frightfully that it was a great relief when they died  and were at rest. The cure of the parish church was so good to them,  never minding how many times a day he toiled up that long hill in the  blazing sunshine, if he could comfort some poor soul, or speed them on  their way fortified with the last rites of the Church.    One poor Breton soldier could not bear the thought of being buried  without a coffin--he spoke about it for days before he died, till Madame  D----, a lady living in the town to whom we owe countless acts of  kindness, promised that she would provide a coffin, so the poor lad died  quite happily and peacefully, and the coffin and a decent funeral were  provided in due course, though, of course, he was not able to have a  soldier's funeral. Some of these poor French soldiers were dreadfully  homesick--most of them were married, and some were fathers of families  who had to suddenly leave their peaceful occupations to come to the war.  Jules, a dapper little pastrycook with pink cheeks and bright black  eyes, had been making a batch of tarts when his summons had come. And he  was much better suited to making tarts than to fighting, poor little  man, for he was utterly unnerved by what he had gone through, and used  to have dreadful fits of crying and sobbing which it was very difficult  to stop.    Some of the others, and especially the Zouaves, one could not imagine in  any other profession than that of soldiering. How jolly and cheerful  they were, always making the best of everything, and when the German  patients had gone we really had time to nurse them and look after them  properly. Those who were able for the exertion were carried out to the  garden, and used to lie under the pear-trees telling each other  wonderful stories of what they had been through, and drinking in fresh  health and strength every day from the beautiful breeze that we had on  the very hottest days up on our hill. We had to guard them very  carefully while they were in the garden, however, for if one man had  tried to escape the hospital would have been burnt down and the  officials probably shot. So two orderlies and two Red Cross  probationers were always on duty there, and I think they enjoyed it as  much as the men.    Suddenly a fresh thunderbolt fell.    One Sunday morning the announcement was made that every French patient  was to go to Germany on Monday morning at eight.    We were absolutely in"]]]
