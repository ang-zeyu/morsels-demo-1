The only thing missing was white bread, for Germany, at the  beginning of the war, permitted only Kriegsbrot (war bread) to be baked.    All Berlin streets were crowded and busy.  Military automobiles,  auto-trucks, big moving vans, private automobiles, taxi-cabs and  carriages hurried hither and thither.  Soldiers and officers, seemingly  by the thousands, were parading up and down.  Stores were busy.  Berlin  appeared to be as normal as any other capital.  Even the confidence of  Germany in victory impressed me so that in one of my first despatches I  said:      \"Germany to-day is more confident than ever that all efforts of her  enemies to crush her must prove in vain.  With a threefold offensive,  in Flanders, in Galicia and in northwest Russia, being successfully  prosecuted, there was a spirit of enthusiasm displayed here in both  military and civilian circles that exceeded even the stirring days  immediately following the outbreak of the war.    \"Flags are flying everywhere to-day; the Imperial standards of Germany  and Austria predominate, although there is a goodly showing of the  Turkish Crescent.  Bands are playing as regiment after regiment passes  through the city to entrain for the front.  Through Wilhelmstrasse the  soldiers moved, their hats and guns decorated with fragrant flowers and  with mothers, sisters and sweethearts clinging to and encouraging them.\"      A few weeks before I arrived the Germans were excited over the shipment  of arms and ammunitions from the United States to the Allies, but by  the time I was in Berlin the situation seemed to have changed.  On  April 4th I telegraphed the following despatch which appeared in the  _Evening Sun_, New York:      \"The spirit of animosity towards Americans which swept Germany a few  weeks ago seems to have disappeared.  The 1,400 Americans in Berlin and  those in the smaller cities of Germany have little cause to complain of  discourteous treatment.  Americans just arriving in Berlin in  particular comment upon the friendliness of their reception.  The  Germans have been especially courteous, they declare, on learning of  their nationality.  Feeling against the United States for permitting  arms to be shipped to the Allies still exists, but I have not found  this feeling extensive among the Germans.  Two American doctors  studying in German clinics declare that the wounded soldiers always  talk about 'Amerikanische keugel' (American bullets), but it is my  observation that the persons most outspoken against the sale of  ammunition to the Allies by American manufacturers are the American  residents of Berlin.\"      Two weeks later the situation had changed considerably.  On the 24th I  telegraphed: \"Despite the bitter criticism of the United States by  German newspapers for refusing to end the traffic in munitions, it is  semi-officially explained that this does not represent the real views  of the German Government.  The censor has been instructed to permit the  newspapers to express themselves frankly on this subject and on  Secretary Bryan's reply to the von Bernstorff note, but it has been  emphasised that their views reflect popular opinion and the editorial  side of the matter and not the Government.    \"The _Lokal Anzeiger_, following up its attack of yesterday, to-day  says:    \"'The answer of the United States is no surprise to Germany and  naturally it fails to convince Germany that a flourishing trade in  munitions of war is in accord with strict neutrality.  The German  argument was based upon the practice of international law, but the  American reply was based upon the commercial advantages enjoyed by the  ammunition shippers.'\"    April 24th was von Tirpitz day.  It was the anniversary of the entrance  of the Grand Admiral in the German Navy fifty years before, and the  eighteenth anniversary of his debut in the cabinet, a record for a  German Minister of Marine.  There was tremendous rejoicing throughout  the country, and the Admiral, who spent his Prussian birthday at the  Navy Department, was overwhelmed with congratulations.  Headed by the  Kaiser, telegrams came from every official in Germany.  The press paid  high tribute to his blockade, declaring that it was due to him alone  that England was so terror-stricken by submarines.    I was not in Germany very long until I was impressed by the remarkable  control the Government had on public opinion by censorship of the  press.  People believe, without exception, everything they read in the  newspapers.  And I soon discovered that the censor was so accustomed to  dealing with German editors that he applied the same standards to the  foreign correspondents.  A reporter could telegraph not what he  observed and heard, but what the censors desired American readers to  hear and know about Germany.    [Illustration: A Berlin \"Extra\"]    I was in St. Quentin, France (which the Germans on their 1917  withdrawal set on fire) at the headquarters of General von Below, when  news came May 8th that the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed.  I read the  bulletins as they arrived.  I heard the comments of the Germans who  were waging war in an enemy country.  I listened as they spoke of the  loss of American and other women and children.  I was amazed when I  heard them say that a woman had no more right on the _Lusitania_ than  she would have on an ammunition wagon on the Somme.  The day before I  was in the first line trenches on the German front which crossed the  road running from Peronne to Albert.  At that time this battlefield,  which a year and a half later was destined to be the scene of the  greatest slaughter in history, was as quiet and beautiful as this  picturesque country of northern France was in peace times.  Only a few  trenches and barbed wire entanglements marred the scene.    On May 9th I left St. Quentin for Brussels.  Here I was permitted by  the General Government to send a despatch reflecting the views of the  German army in France about the sinking of the _Lusitania_.  I wrote  what I thought was a fair article.  I told how the bulletin was posted  in front of the Hotel de Ville; how the officers and soldiers marching  to and away from the front stopped, read, smiled and congratulated each  other because the Navy was at last helping the Army \"win the war.\"  There were no expressions of regret over the loss of life.  These  officers and soldiers had seen so many dead, soldiers and civilians,  men and women, in Belgium and France that neither death nor murder  shocked them.    The telegram was approved by the military censor and forwarded to  Berlin.  I stayed in Belgium two days longer, went to Louvain and Liege  and reached Berlin May 12th.  The next day I learned at the Foreign  Office that my despatch was stopped because it conflicted with the  opinions which the German Government was sending officially by wireless  to Washington and to the American newspapers.  I felt that this was  unfair, but I was subject to the censorship and had no appeal.    I did not forget this incident because it showed a striking difference  of opinion between the army, which was fighting for Germany, and the  Foreign Office, which was explaining and excusing what the Army and  Navy did.  The Army always justified the events in Belgium, but the  Foreign Office did not.  And this was the first incident which made me  feel that even in Germany, which was supposed to be united, there were  differences of opinion.    In September, 1915, while the German army was moving against Russia  like a surging sea, I was invited to go to the front near Vilna.  During the intervening months I had observed and recorded as much as  possible the growing indignation in Germany because the United States  permitted the shipment of arms and ammunition to the Allies.  In June I  had had an interview with Secretary of State von Jagow, in which he  protested against the attitude of the United States Government and said  that America was not acting as neutral as Germany did during the  Spanish-American war.  He cited page 168 of Andrew D. White's book in  which Ambassador White said he persuaded Germany not to permit a German  ship laden with ammunition and consigned for Spain to sail.  I thought  that if Germany had adopted such an attitude toward America, that in  justice to Germany Washington should adopt the same position.  After  von Jagow gave me the facts in possession of the Foreign Office and  after he had loaned me Mr. White's book, I looked up the data.  I found  to my astonishment that Mr. White reported to the State Department that  a ship of ammunition sailed from Hamburg, and that he had not  protested, although the Naval Attache had requested him to do so.  The  statements of von Jagow and Mr. White's in his autobiography did not  agree with the facts.  Germany did send ammunition to Spain, but  Wilhelmstrasse was using Mr. White's book as proof that the Krupp  interests did not supply our enemy in 1898.  The latter part of  September I entered Kovno, the important Russian fortress, eight days  after the army captured it.  I was escorted, together with other  foreign correspondents, from one fort to another and shown what the 42  cm. guns had destroyed.  I saw 400 machine guns which were captured and  1,300 pieces of heavy artillery.  The night before, at a dinner party,  the officers had argued against the United States because of the  shipment of supplies to Russia.  They said that if the United States  had not aided Russia, that country would not have been able to resist  the invaders.  I did not know the facts, but I accepted their  statements.  When I was shown the machine guns, I examined them and  discovered that every one of the 400 was made at Essen or Magdeburg,  Germany.  Of the 1,300 pieces of artillery every cannon was made in  Germany except a few English ship guns.  Kovno was fortified by  _German_ artillery, not American.    A few days later I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#5)"],[1,"obligation I was under to this gentleman for communicating to  me the observations he made, from time to time, during the voyage, I have  since been indebted to him for the perusal of his journal, with leave to  take from it whatever I thought might contribute to the improvement of this  work.    For the convenience of the generality of readers, I have reduced the time  from the nautical to the civil computation, so that whenever the terms A.M.  and P.M. are used, the former signifies the forenoon, and the latter the  afternoon of the same day.    In all the courses, bearings, &c., the variation of the compass is allowed,  unless the contrary is expressed. And now it may be necessary to say, that,  as I am on the point of sailing on a third expedition, I leave this account  of my last voyage in the hands of some friends, who, in my absence, have  kindly accepted the office of correcting the press for me; who are pleased  to think that what I have here to relate is better to be given in my own  words, than in the words of another person; especially as it is a work  designed for information, and not merely for amusement; in which, it is  their opinion, that candour and fidelity will counter-balance the want of  ornament.    I shall therefore conclude this introductory discourse with desiring the  reader to excuse the inaccuracies of style, which doubtless he will  frequently meet with in the following narrative; and that, when such occur,  he will recollect that it is the production of a man, who has not had the  advantage of much school education, but who has been constantly at sea from  his youth; and though, with the assistance of a few good friends, he has  passed through all the stations belonging to a seaman, from an apprentice  boy in the coal trade, to a post-captain in the royal navy, he has had no  opportunity of cultivating letters. After this account of myself, the  public must not expect from me the elegance of a fine writer, or the  plausibility of a professed book-maker; but will, I hope, consider me as a  plain man, zealously exerting himself in the service of his country, and  determined to give the best account he is able of his proceedings.

BOOK I    FROM OUR DEPARTURE FROM ENGLAND TO LEAVING THE SOCIETY ISLES  THE FIRST TIME.    CHAPTER I.    _Passage from Deptford to the Cape of Good Hope, with an Account of  several Incidents that happened by the Way, and Transactions there._    1772 April    I sailed from Deptford, April 9th, 1772, but got no farther than Woolwich,  where I was detained by easterly winds till the 23d, when the ship fell  down to Long Reach, and the next day was joined by the Adventure. Here both  ships received on board their powder, guns, gunners' stores, and marines.    1772 May    On the 10th of May we left Long Reach, with orders to touch at Plymouth;  but in plying down the river, the Resolution was found to be very crank,  which made it necessary to put into Sheerness in order to remove this evil,  by making some alteration in her upper works. These the officers of the  yard were ordered to take in hand immediately; and Lord Sandwich and Sir  Hugh Palliser came down to see them executed in such a manner as might  effectually answer the purpose intended.    1772 June    On the 22d of June the ship was again completed for sea, when I sailed from  Sheerness; and on the 3d of July joined the Adventure in Plymouth Sound.  The evening before, we met, off the Sound, Lord Sandwich, in the Augusta  yacht, (who was on his return from visiting the several dock-yards,) with  the Glory frigate and Hazard sloop. We saluted his lordship with seventeen  guns; and soon after he and Sir Hugh Palliser gave us the last mark of the  very great attention they had paid to this equipment, by coming on board,  to satisfy themselves that every thing was done to my wish, and that the  ship was found to answer to my satisfaction.    At Plymouth I received my instructions, dated the 25th of June, directing  me to take under my command the Adventure; to make the best of my way to  the island of Madeira, there to take in a supply of wine, and then proceed  to the Cape of Good Hope, where I was to refresh the ships' companies, and  to take on board such provisions and necessaries as I might stand in need  of. After leaving the Cape of Good Hope, I was to proceed to the southward,  and endeavour to fall in with Cape Circumcision, which was said by Monsieur  Bouvet to lie in the latitude of 54 deg. S. and in about 11 deg. 20' E. longitude  from Greenwich. If I discovered this cape, I was to satisfy myself whether  it was a part of the continent which had so much engaged the attention of  geographers and former navigators, or a part of an island. If it proved to  be the former, I was to employ myself diligently in exploring as great an  extent of it as I could, and to make such notations thereon, and  observations of every kind, as might be useful either to navigation or  commerce, or tend to the promotion of natural knowledge. I was also  directed to observe the genius, temper, disposition, and number of the  inhabitants, if there were any, and endeavour, by all proper means, to  cultivate a friendship and alliance with them; making them presents of such  things as they might value; inviting them to traffic, and shewing them  every kind of civility and regard. I was to continue to employ myself on  this service, and making discoveries either to the eastward or westward, as  my situation might render most eligible; keeping in as high a latitude as I  could, and prosecuting my discoveries as near to the South Pole as  possible, so long as the condition of the ships, the health of their crews,  and the state of their provisions, would admit of; taking care to reserve  as much of the latter as would enable me to reach some known port, where I  was to procure a sufficiency to bring me home to England.
