David did say vaguely to Letty when he was leaving, that he hoped  \"they would be good,\" the screams that rent the air at the precise  moment of farewell rather giving the lie to his hopes.    Letty was struggling to end the interview without breaking down, for  she was worn out nervously as well as physically, and thought if she  could only be alone with her problems and her cares she would rather  write to David than tell him her mind face to face.    Brother and sister held each other tightly for a moment, kissed each  other good-bye, and then Letty watched Osh Popham's sleigh slipping  off with David into the snowy distance, the merry tinkle of the bells  adding to the sadness in her dreary heart. Dick gone yesterday, Dave  to-day; Beulah without Dick and Dave! The two joys of her life were  missing and in their places two unknown babies whose digestive systems  were going to need constant watching, according to Dr. Lee. Then she  went about with set lips, doing the last sordid things that death  brings in its wake; doing them as she had seen her mother do before  her. She threw away the husks in Eva's under mattress and put fresh  ones in; she emptied the feathers from the feather bed and pillows and  aired them in the sun while she washed the ticking; she scrubbed the  paint in the sick-room, and in between her tasks learned from Clarissa  Perry the whole process of bringing up babies by hand.    That was three years ago. At first David had sent ten dollars a month  from his slender earnings, never omitting it save for urgent reasons.  He evidently thought of the twins as \"company\" for his sister and  their care a pleasant occupation, since she had \"almost\" a living  income; taking in a few coats to make, just to add an occasional  luxury to the bare necessities of life provided by her mother's will.    His letters were brief, dispirited, and infrequent, but they had not  ceased altogether till within the last few months, during which  Letty's to him had been returned from Boston with \"Not found\"  scribbled on the envelopes.    The firm in whose care Letty had latterly addressed him simply wrote,  in answer to her inquiries, that Mr. Gilman had not been in their  employ for some time and they had no idea of his whereabouts.    The rest was silence.          [Illustration]    V      A good deal of water had run under Beulah Bridge since Letty Boynton  had sat at her window on a December evening unconsciously furnishing  copy and illustration for a Christmas card; yet there had been very  few outward changes in the village. Winter had melted into spring,  burst into summer, faded into autumn, lapsed into winter again,--the  same old, ever-recurring pageant in the world of Nature, and the same  procession of incidents in the neighborhood life.    The harvest moon and the hunter's moon had come and gone; the first  frost, the family dinners and reunions at Thanksgiving, the first  snowfall; and now, as Christmas approached, the same holiday spirit  was abroad in the air, slightly modified as it passed by Mrs. Popham's  mournful visage.    One or two babies had swelled the census, giving the minister hope of  a larger Sunday-School; one or two of the very aged neighbors had  passed into the beyond; and a few romantic and enterprising young  farmers had espoused wives, among them Osh Popham's son.    The manner of their choice was not entirely to the liking of the  village. Digby Popham had married into the rival church and as his  betrothed was a masterful young lady it was feared that Digby would  leave Mr. Larrabee's flock to worship with his wife. Another had  married without visible means of support, a proceeding always to be  regretted by thoroughly prudent persons over fifty; and the third,  Deacon Todd's eldest son, had somehow or other met a siren from  Vermont and insisted on wedding her when there were plenty of  marriageable girls in Beulah.    \"I've no patience with such actions!\" grumbled Mrs. Popham. \"Young  folks are so full of notions nowadays that they look for change and  excitement everywheres. I s'pose James Todd thinks it's a decent,  respectable way of actin', to turn his back on the girls he's been  brought up an' gone to school with, and court somebody he never laid  eyes on till a year ago. It's a free country, but I must say I don't  think it's very refined for a man to go clear off somewheres and marry  a perfect stranger!\"    Births, marriages, and deaths, however, paled into insignificance  compared with the spectacular debut of the minister's wife as a writer  and embellisher of Christmas cards, two at least having been seen at  the local milliner's store. How many she had composed, and how many of  them (said Mrs. Popham) might have been rejected, nobody knew, though  there was much speculation; and more than one citizen remarked on the  size of the daily package of mail matter handed out by the rural  delivery man at the parsonage gate.    No one but Mrs. Larrabee and Letty Boynton were in possession of all  the thrilling details attending the public appearance of these works  of art; the words and letters of appreciation, the commendation, and  the occasional blows to pride that attended their acceptance and  publication.    Mrs. Larrabee's first attempt, with the sketch of Letty at the window  on Christmas Eve, her hearth-fire aglow, her heart and her door open  that Love might enter in if the Christ Child came down the snowy  street,--this went to the Excelsior Card Company in a large Western  city, and the following correspondence ensued:         MRS. LUTHER LARRABEE,            _Beulah, N.H._         DEAR MADAM:--         Your letter bears a well-known postmark, for my father and       my grandfather were born and lived in New Hampshire, \"up       Beulah way.\" I accept your verses because of the beauty of       the picture that accompanied them, and because Christmas       means more than holly and plum pudding and gift-laden trees       to me, for I am a religious man,--a ministerial father and       three family deacons saw to that, though it doesn't always       work that way!--Frankly, I do not expect your card to have a       wide appeal, so I offer you only five dollars.         A Christmas card, my dear madam, must have a greeting, and       yours has none. If the pictured room were a real room, and       some one who had seen or lived in it should recognize it, it       would attract his eye, but we cannot manufacture cards to       meet such romantic improbabilities. I am emboldened to ask       you (because you live in Beulah) if you will not paint the       outside of some lonely, little New Hampshire cottage, as       humble as you like, and make me some more verses; something,       say, about \"the folks back home.\"                                             Sincerely yours,                                              REUBEN SMALL.                                                        BEULAH, N.H.         DEAR MR. SMALL:--         I accept your offer of five dollars for my maiden effort in       Christmas cards with thanks, and will try my hand at       something more popular. I am not above liking to make a       \"wide appeal,\" but the subject you propose is rather a       staggering one, because you accompany it with a phrase       lacking rhythm, and difficult to rhyme. You will at once       see, by running through the alphabet, that \"roam\" is the       only serviceable rhyme for \"_home_,\" but the union of the       two suggests jingle or doggerel. I defy any minor poet when       furnished with such a phrase, to refrain from bursting at       once into:--         No matter where you travel, no matter where you roam,       You'll never dum-di-dum-di-dee           The folks back home.                                             Sincerely yours,                                              REBA LARRABEE.         P.S. On second thought I believe James Whitcomb Riley could       do it and overcome the difficulties, but alas! I have not       his touch!         DEAR MRS. LARRABEE:--         We never refuse verses because they are too good for the       public. Nothing is too good for the public, but the public       must be the judge of what pleases it.         \"The folks back home\" is a phrase that will strike the eye       and ear of thousands of wandering sons and daughters. They       will choose that card from the heaped-up masses on the       counters and send it to every State in the Union. If you       will glance at your first card you will see that though       people may read it they will always leave it on the counter.       I want my cards on counters, by the thousand, but I don't       intend that they should be left there!         Make an effort, dear Mrs. Larrabee! I could get \"the folks       back home\" done here in the office in half an hour, but I'm       giving you the chance because you live in Beulah, New       Hampshire, and because you make beautiful pictures.                                             Sincerely yours,                                              REUBEN SMALL.         DEAR MR. SMALL:--         I enclose a colored sketch of the outside of the cottage       whose living-room I used in my first card. I chose it       because I love the person who lives in it; because it always       looks beautiful in the snow, and because the tree is so       picturesque. The fact that it is gray for lack of paint may       remind a casual wanderer that there is something to do, now       and then, for the \"folks back home.\" The verse is just as       bad as I thought it would be. It seems incredible that any       one should buy it, but ours is a big country and there are       many kinds of people living in it, so who knows? Why don't       you accept my picture and then you write the card? I could       not put my initials on this!

He came to  London in 1733, under the patronage of the Italian faction, especially  to serve as a thorn in the side of Handel. His first opera, \"Ariadne,\"  was a great success; but when he had the audacity to challenge the great  German in the field of oratorio, his defeat was so overwhelming that  he candidly admitted his rival's superiority. But he believed that no  operas in the world were equal to his own, and he composed fifty of them  during his life, extending to the days of Haydn, whom he had the honor  of teaching, while the father of the symphony, on the other hand,  cleaned Por-pora's boots and powdered his wig for him.    Another Italian opponent was Hasse, a man of true genius, who in his old  age instructed some of the most splendid singers in the history of the  lyric stage. He also married one of the most gifted and most beautiful  divas of Europe, Faustina Bordoni. The following anecdote does equal  credit to Hasse's heart and penetration: In after-years, when he had  left England, he was again sent for to take Handel's place as conductor  of opera and oratorio. Hasse inquired, \"What! is Handel dead?\" On  being told no, he indignantly refused, saying he was not worthy to tie  Handel's shoe-latchets.    There are also Dr. Pepusch, the Anglicized Prussian, and Dr. Greene,  both names well known in English music. Pepusch had had the leading  place, before Handel's arrival, as organist and conductor, and made a  distinct place for himself even after the sun of Handel had obscured all  of his contemporaries. He wrote the music of the \"Beggar's Opera,\" which  was the great sensation of the times, and which still keeps possession  of the stage. Pepusch was chiefly notable for his skill in arranging the  popular songs of the day, and probably did more than any other composer  to give the English ballad its artistic form.    The name of Dr. Greene is best known in connection with choral  compositions. His relations with Handel and Bononcini are hardly  creditable to him. He seems to have flattered each in turn. He upheld  Bononcini in the great madrigal controversy, and appears to have wearied  Handel by his repeated visits. The great Saxon easily saw through the  flatteries of a man who was in reality an ambitious rival, and joked  about him, not always in the best taste. When he was told that Greene  was giving concerts at the \"Devil Tavern,\" near Temple Bar, \"Ah!\" he  exclaimed, \"mein poor friend Toctor Greene--so he is gone to de Tevil!\"    From 1732 to 1740 Handel's life presents the suggestive and  often-repeated experience in the lives of men of genius--a soul with a  great creative mission, of which it is half unconscious, partly  yielding to and partly struggling against the tendencies of the age, yet  gradually crystallizing into its true form, and getting consecrated to  its true work. In these eight years Handel presented to the public ten  operas and five oratorios. It was in 1731 that the great significant  fact, though unrecognized by himself and others, occurred, which stamped  the true bent of his genius. This was the production of his first  oratorio in England. He was already playing his operas to empty houses,  the subject of incessant scandal and abuse on the part of his enemies,  but holding his way with steady cheerfulness and courage. Twelve years  before this he had composed the oratorio of \"Esther,\" but it was still  in manuscript, uncared for and neglected. It was finally produced by a  society called Philharmonic, under the direction of Bernard Gates, the  royal chapel-master. Its fame spread wide, and we read these significant  words in one of the old English newspapers: \"'Esther,' an English  oratorio, was performed six times, and very full.\"    Shortly after this Handel himself conducted \"Esther\" at the Haymarket  by royal command. His success encouraged him to write \"Deborah,\" another  attempt in the same field, and it met a warm reception from the public,  March 17, 1733.    For about fifteen years Handel had struggled heroically in the  composition of Italian operas. With these he had at first succeeded; but  his popularity waned more and more, and he became finally the continued  target for satire, scorn, and malevolence. In obedience to the drift  of opinion, all the great singers, who had supported him at the outset,  joined the rival ranks or left England. In fact it may be almost said  that the English public were becoming dissatisfied with the whole system  and method of Italian music. Colley Cibber, the actor and dramatist,  explains why Italian opera could never satisfy the requirement of  Handel, or be anything more than an artificial luxury in England: \"The  truth is, this kind of entertainment is entirely sensational.\" Still  both Handel and his friends and his foes, all the exponents of musical  opinion in England, persevered obstinately in warming this foreign  exotic into a new lease of life.    The quarrel between the great Saxon composer and his opponents  raged incessantly both in public and private. The newspaper and the  drawing-room rang alike with venomous diatribes. Handel was called a  swindler, a drunkard, and a blasphemer, to whom Scripture even was  not sacred. The idea of setting Holy Writ to music scandalized the  Pharisees, who reveled in the licentious operas and love-songs of  the Italian school. All the small wits of the time showered on Handel  epigram and satire unceasingly. The greatest of all the wits, however,  Alexander Pope, was his firm friend and admirer; and in the \"Dunciad,\"  wherein the wittiest of poets impaled so many of the small fry of the  age with his pungent and vindictive shaft, he also slew some of the most  malevolent of Handel's foes.    Fielding, in \"Tom Jones,\" has an amusing hit at the taste of the period:  \"It was Mr. Western's custom every afternoon, as soon as he was drunk,  to hear his daughter play on the harpsichord; for he was a great lover  of music, and perhaps, had he lived in town, might have passed as a  connoisseur, for he always excepted against the finest compositions of  Mr. Handel.\"    So much had it become the fashion to criticise Handel's new effects in  vocal and instrumental composition, that some years later Mr. Sheridan  makes one of his characters fire a pistol simply to shock the audience,  and makes him say in a stage whisper to the gallery, \"This hint,  gentlemen, I took from Handel.\"    The composer's Oxford experience was rather amusing and suggestive.  We find it recorded that in July, 1733, \"one Handell, a foreigner, was  desired to come to Oxford to perform in music.\" Again the same writer  says: \"Handell with his lousy crew, a great number of foreign fiddlers,  had a performance for his own benefit at the theatre.\" One of the dons  writes of the performance as follows: \"This is an innovation; but every  one paid his five shillings to try how a little fiddling would sit upon  him. And, notwithstanding the barbarous and inhuman combination of such  a parcel of unconscionable scamps, he [Handel] disposed of the most of  his tickets.\"    \"Handel and his lousy crew,\" however, left Oxford with the prestige of  a magnificent victory. His third oratorio, \"Athaliah,\" was received with  vast applause by a great audience. Some of his university admirers, who  appreciated academic honors more than the musician did, urged him to  accept the degree of Doctor of Music, for which he would have to pay a  small fee. The characteristic reply was a Parthian arrow: \"Vat te tevil  I trow my money away for dat vich the blockhead vish'? I no vant!\"      V.    In 1738 Handel was obliged to close the theatre and suspend payment.  He had made and spent during his operatic career the sum of L10,000  sterling, besides dissipating the sum of L50,000 subscribed by his noble  patrons. The rival house lasted but a few months longer, and the Duchess  of Marlborough and her friends, who ruled the opposition clique and  imported Bononcini, paid L12,000 for the pleasure of ruining Handel. His  failure as an operatic composer is due in part to the same causes  which constituted his success in oratorio and cantata. It is a little  significant to notice that, alike by the progress of his own genius and  by the force of conditions, he was forced out of the operatic field at  the very time when he strove to tighten his grip on it.    His free introduction of choral and instrumental music, his creation of  new forms and remodeling of old ones, his entire subordination of the  words in the story to a pure musical purpose, offended the singers and  retarded the action of the drama in the eyes of the audience; yet it was  by virtue of these unpopular characteristics that the public mind was  being moulded to understand and love the form of the oratorio.    From 1734 to 1738 Handel composed and produced a number of operatic  works, the principal ones of which were \"Alcina,\" 1735; \"Arminio,\" 1737;  and \"Berenice,\" 1737. He also during these years wrote the magnificent  music to Dryden's \"Alexander's Feast,\" and the great funeral anthem on  the occasion of Queen Caroline's death in the latter part of the year  1737.    We can hardly solve the tenacity of purpose with which Handel persevered  in the composition of operatic music after it had ruined him; but it was  still some time before he fully appreciated the true turn of his genius,  which could not be trifled with or ignored. In his adversity he had some  consolation. His creditors were patient, believing in his integrity. The  royal family were his firm friends.    Southey tells us that Handel, having asked the youthful Prince of  Wales, then a child, and afterward George the Third, if he loved music,  answered, when the prince expressed his pleasure: \"A good boy, a good  boy! You shall protect my fame when I am dead.\" Afterward, when the  half-imbecile"]]]
