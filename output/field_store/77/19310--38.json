Potiphar rested satisfied  with this report, paid the price asked for Joseph, and the  Medanites and the Ishmaelites went their way.      JOSEPH'S COAT BROUGHT TO HIS FATHER    No sooner was the sale of Joseph an accomplished fact  than the sons of Jacob repented of their deed. They even  hastened after the Midianites to ransom Joseph, but their  efforts to overtake them were vain, and they had to accept  the inevitable. Meantime Reuben had rejoined his brethren.[59]  He had been so deeply absorbed in penances, in praying  and studying the Torah, in expiation of his sin against  his father, that he had not been able to remain with his  brethren and tend the flocks, and thus it happened that he  was not on the spot when Joseph was sold.[60] His first errand  was to go to the pit, in the hope of finding Joseph there. In  that case he would have carried him off and restored him  to his father clandestinely, without the knowledge of his  brethren. He stood at the opening and called again and  again, \"Joseph, Joseph!\" As he received no answer, he  concluded that Joseph had perished, either by reason of  terror or as the result of a snake bite, and he descended into  the pit, only to find that he was not there, either living or  dead. He mounted to the top again, and rent his clothes,  and cried out, \"The lad is not there, and what answer shall  I give to my father, if he be dead?\" Then Reuben returned  unto his brethren, and told them that Joseph bad vanished  from the pit, whereat he was deeply grieved, because he,  being the oldest of the sons, was responsible to their father  Jacob. The brethren made a clean breast of what they had  done with Joseph, and they related to him how they had  tried to make good their evil deed, and how their efforts had  been vain.    Now there remained nothing to do but invent a plausible  explanation for their brother's disappearance to give to  Jacob. First of all, however, they took an oath not to betray  to his father or any human being what they bad actually  done with Joseph. He who violated the oath would be put  to the sword by the rest. Then they took counsel together  about what to say to Jacob. It was Issachar's advice to tear  Joseph's coat of many colors, and dip it in the blood of a  little kid of the goats, to make Jacob believe that his son had  been torn by a wild beast.[61] The reason he suggested a kid  was because its blood looks like human blood. In expiation  of this act of deception, it was ordained that a kid be used  as an atonement sacrifice when the Tabernacle was  dedicated.[62]    Simon opposed this suggestion. He did not want to relinquish  Joseph's coat, and he threatened to hew down any  one that should attempt to wrest it from him by force. The  reason for his vehemence was that he was very much enraged  against his brethren for not having slain Joseph. But  they threatened him in turn, saying, \"If thou wilt not give  up the coat, we shall say that thou didst execute the evil deed  thyself.\" At that Simon surrendered it,[63] and Naphtali  brought it to Jacob, handing it to him with the words:  \"When we were driving our herds homeward, we found  this garment covered with blood and dust on the highway,  a little beyond Shechem. Know now whether it be thy son's  coat or not.\" Jacob recognized Joseph's coat, and, overwhelmed  by grief, he fell prostrate, and long lay on the  ground motionless, like a stone. Then he arose, and set up  a loud cry, and wept, saying, \"It is my son's coat.\"    In great haste Jacob dispatched a slave to his sons, to bid  them come to him, that he might learn more about what had  happened. In the evening they all came, their garments  rent, and dust strewn upon their heads. When they confirmed  all that Naphtali had told him, Jacob broke out in  mourning and lamentation: \"It is my son's coat; an evil  beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in  pieces. I sent him to you to see whether it was well with  you, and well with the flock. He went to do my errand, and  while I thought him to be with you, the misfortune befell.\"  Thereto the sons of Jacob made reply: \"He came to us not  at all. Since we left thee, we have not set eyes on him.\"    After these words, Jacob could doubt no longer that  Joseph bad been torn by wild beasts, and he mourned for  his son, saying: \"O my son Joseph, my son, I sent thee to  inquire after the welfare of thy brethren, and now thou art  torn by wild beasts. It is my fault that this evil chance  hath come upon thee. I am distressed for thee, my son, I  am sorely distressed. How sweet was thy life to me, and  how bitter is thy death! Would God I had died for thee, O  Joseph, my son, for now I am distressed on thy account.  O my son Joseph, where art thou, and where is thy soul?  Arise, arise from thy place, and look upon my grief for  thee. Come and count the tears that roll down my cheeks,  and bring the tale of them before God, that His wrath be  turned away from me. O Joseph, my son, how painful and  appalling was thy death! None hath died a death like thine  since the world doth stand. I know well that it came to  pass by reason of my sins. O that thou wouldst return and  see the bitter sorrow thy misfortune hath brought upon me!  But it is true, it was not I that created thee, and formed  thee. I gave thee neither spirit nor soul, but God created  thee. He formed thy bones, covered them with flesh,  breathed the breath of life into thy nostrils, and then gave  thee unto me. And God who gave thee unto me, He hath  taken thee from me, and from Him hath this dispensation  come upon me. What the Lord doeth is well done!\" In  these words and many others like them Jacob mourned and  bewailed his son, until he fell to the ground prostrate and  immovable.    When the sons of Jacob saw the vehemence of their  father's grief, they repented of their deed, and wept bitterly.  Especially Judah was grief-stricken. He laid his father's  head upon his knees, and wiped his tears away as they  flowed from his eyes, while he himself broke out in violent  weeping. The sons of Jacob and their wives all sought to  comfort their father. They arranged a great memorial service,  and they wept and mourned over Joseph's death and  over their father's sorrow.[64] But Jacob refused to be  comforted.    The tidings of his son's death caused the loss of two  members of Jacob's family. Bilhah and Dinah could not  survive their grief. Bilhah passed away the very day  whereon the report reached Jacob, and Dinah died soon  after, and so he had three losses to mourn in one month.    He received the tidings of Joseph's death in the seventh  month, Tishri, and on the tenth day of the month, and therefore  the children of Israel are bidden to weep and afflict  their souls on this day. Furthermore, on this day the sin  offering of atonement shall be a kid of the goats, because the  sons of Jacob transgressed with a kid, in the blood of which  they dipped Joseph's coat, and thus they brought sorrow  upon Jacob.[65]    When he had recovered somewhat from the stunning blow  which the tidings of his favorite son's death had dealt him,  Jacob rose up from the ground and addressed his sons, tears  streaming down his cheeks all the while. \"Up,\" he said,  \"take your swords and your bows, go out in the field, and  make search, perhaps you will find the body of my son, and  you will bring it to me, so that I may bury it. Keep a lookout,  too, for beasts of prey, and catch the first you meet.  Seize it and bring it to me. It may be that God will have  pity upon my sorrow, and put the beast between your hands  that hath torn my child in pieces, and I will take my revenge  upon it.\"    The sons of Jacob set out on the morrow to do the bidding  of their father, while he remained at home and wept and  lamented for Joseph. In the wilderness they found a wolf,  which they caught and brought to Jacob alive, saying:  \"Here is the first wild beast we encountered, and we have  brought it to thee. But of thy son's corpse we saw not a  trace.\" Jacob seized the wolf, and, amid loud weeping, he  addressed these words to him: \"Why didst thou devour my  son Joseph, without any fear of the God of the earth, and  without taking any thought of the grief thou wouldst bring  down upon me? Thou didst devour my son without reason,  he was guilty of no manner of transgression, and thou didst  roll the responsibility for his death upon me. But God  avengeth him that is persecuted.\"    To grant consolation to Jacob, God opened the mouth of  the beast, and he spake: \"As the Lord liveth, who hath  created me, and as thy soul liveth, my lord, I have not seen  thy son, and I did not rend him in pieces. From a land afar  off I came to seek mine own son, who suffered a like fate  with thine. He hath disappeared, and I know not whether  he be dead or alive, and therefore I came hither ten days ago  to find him. This day, while I was searching for him, thy  sons met me, and they seized me, and, adding more grief to  my grief over my lost son, they brought me hither to thee.  This is my story, and now, O son of man, I am in thy hands,  thou canst dispose of me this day as seemeth well in thy  sight, but I swear unto thee by the God that bath created me,  I have not seen thy son, nor have I torn him in pieces, never  hath the flesh of man come into my mouth.\" Astonished  at the speech of the wolf, Jacob let him go, unhindered,  whithersoever he would, but he mourned his son Joseph as  before.[66]    It is a law of nature that however much one may grieve  over the death of a dear one, at the end of a year consolation  finds its way to the heart of the mourner. But the disappearance  of a living man can never be wiped out of one's  memory. Therefore the fact that he was inconsolable made  Jacob suspect that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14958"],[0,"Mother West Wind 'Why' Stories (#5)"],[1,"and ask  Grandfather Frog about it now. He'll be sure to know,\" spoke up one of  the Merry Little Breezes.    \"All right,\" replied Peter, hopping to his feet. \"But you'll have to  ask him. I've asked him for so many stories that I don't dare ask for  another right away, for fear that he will say that I am a nuisance.\"    So it was agreed that the Merry Little Breezes should ask Grandfather  Frog why it is that Jimmy Skunk never hurries, and that Peter should  keep out of sight until Grandfather Frog had begun the story, for they  were sure that there would be a story. Away they all hurried to the  Smiling Pool. The Merry Little Breezes raced so hard that they were  quite out of breath when they burst through the bulrushes and  surrounded Grandfather Frog, as he sat on his big green lily-pad.    \"Oh, Grandfather Frog, why is it that Jimmy Skunk never hurries?\" they  panted.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" replied Grandfather Frog in his deepest, gruffest voice.  \"Chug-a-rum! Probably because he has learned better.\"    \"Oh!\" said one of the Merry Little Breezes, in a rather faint,  disappointed sort of voice. Just then he spied a fat, foolish, green  fly and blew it right over to Grandfather Frog, who snapped it up in a  flash. Right away all the Merry Little Breezes began to hunt for  foolish green flies and blow them over to Grandfather Frog, until he  didn't have room for another one inside his white and yellow  waistcoat. Indeed the legs of the last one he tried to swallow stuck  out of one corner of his big mouth.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog, trying very hard to get those  legs out of sight. \"Chug-a-rum! I always like to do something for  those who do something for me, and I suppose now that I ought to tell  you why it is that Jimmy Skunk never hurries. I would, if Peter Rabbit  were here. If I tell you the story, Peter will be sure to hear of it,  and then he will give me no peace until I tell it to him, and I don't  like to tell stories twice.\"    \"But he is here!\" cried one of the Little Breezes. \"He's right over  behind that little clump of tall grass.\"    \"Humph! I thought he wasn't very far away,\" grunted Grandfather Frog,  with a twinkle in his great, goggly eyes.    Peter crept out of his hiding-place, looking rather shamefaced and  very foolish. Then the Merry Little Breezes settled themselves on the  lily-pads in a big circle around Grandfather Frog, and Peter sat down  as close to the edge of the bank of the Smiling Pool as he dared to  get. After what seemed to them a very long time, Grandfather Frog  swallowed the legs of the last foolish green fly, opened his big  mouth, and began:    \"Of course you all know that long, long ago, when the world was young,  things were very different from what they are now, very different  indeed. The great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Jimmy Skunk was  slimmer and trimmer than Jimmy is. He was more like his cousins, Mr.  Weasel and Mr. Mink. He was just as quick moving as they were. Yes,  Sir, Mr. Skunk was very lively on his feet. He had to be to keep out  of the way of his big neighbors, for in those days he didn't have any  means of protecting himself, as Jimmy has now. He was dressed all in  black. You know it wasn't until Old Mother Nature found out that he  was taking advantage of that black suit to get into mischief on dark  nights that she gave him white stripes, so that the darker the night,  the harder it would be for him to keep from being seen.    \"Now Mr. Skunk was very smart and shrewd, oh, very! When the hard  times came, which made so many changes in the lives of the people who  lived in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows, Mr. Skunk was very  quick to see that unless he could think of some way to protect  himself, it was only a matter of time when he would furnish a dinner  for one of his fierce big neighbors, and of course Mr. Skunk had no  desire to do that. It was then that he asked Old Mother Nature to give  him a bag of perfume so strong that it would make everybody ill but  himself. Mother Nature thought it all over, and then she did, but she  made him promise that he would never use it unless he was in great  danger.    \"Mr. Skunk had to try his new defence only once or twice before his  enemies took the greatest care to let him alone. He found that he no  longer had to run for a safe hiding-place when he met Mr. Wolf or Mr.  Lynx or Mr. Panther. They just snarled at him and passed without  offering to touch him. So Mr. Skunk grew very independent and went  where he pleased when he pleased. And, because he no longer had to run  from his enemies, he got out of the habit of running. Then he made a  discovery. He watched those of his neighbors who were forever hurrying  about looking for food, hurrying because all the time there was great  fear upon them that an enemy might be near, hurrying because each was  fearful that his neighbor would get more than he. It wasn't long  before Mr. Skunk saw that in their hurry they overlooked a great deal.  In fact, by just following after them slowly, he found all he wanted  to eat.    \"So Mr. Skunk began to grow fat. His neighbors, who were having hard  work to make a living, grew envious, and said unkind things about him,  and hinted that he must be stealing, or he never could have so much to  eat. But Mr. Skunk didn't mind. He went right on about his business.  He never worried, because, you know, he feared nobody. And he never  hurried, because he found that it paid best to go slowly. In that way  he never missed any of the good things that his hurrying, worrying  neighbors did. So he grew fatter and fatter, while others grew  thinner. After a while he almost forgot how to run. Being fat and  never hurrying or worrying made him good-natured. He kept right on  minding his own affairs and never meddling in the affairs of others,  so that by and by his neighbors began to respect him.    \"Of course he taught his children to do as he did, and they taught  their children. And so, ever since that long-ago day, when the world  was young, that little bag of perfume has been handed down in the  Skunk family, and none of them has ever been afraid. Now you know why  Jimmy Skunk, whom you all know, is so independent and never hurries.\"    \"Thank you! Thank you, Grandfather Frog!\" cried the Merry Little  Breezes. \"When you want some more foolish green flies, just let us  know, and we'll get them for you.\"    \"Chug-a-rum! What are you looking so wistful for, Peter Rabbit?\"  demanded Grandfather Frog.    \"I--I was just wishing that I had a--\" began Peter. Then suddenly he  made a face. \"No, I don't either!\" he declared. \"I guess I'd better be  getting home to the dear Old Briar-patch now. Mrs. Peter probably  thinks something has happened to me.\" And away he went,  lipperty-lipperty-lip.          VI    WHY SAMMY JAY HAS A FINE COAT      Sammy Jay has a very fine coat, a very beautiful coat. Everybody knows  that. In fact, Sammy's coat has long been the envy of a great many of  his neighbors in the Green Forest. Some of them, you know, have very  modest coats. They are not beautiful at all. And yet the owners of  some of these plain coats are among the most honest and hard-working  of all the little people who live in the Green Forest. They find it  hard, very hard indeed, to understand why such a scamp and  mischiefmaker as Sammy Jay should be given such a wonderful blue coat  with white trimmings.    Peter Rabbit often had thought about it. He has a number of feathered  friends whom he likes ever so much better than he does Sammy Jay. In  fact, he and Sammy are forever falling out, because Sammy delights to  tease Peter. He sometimes makes up for it by warning Peter when Granny  or Reddy Fox happens to be about, and Peter is honest enough to  recognize this and put it to Sammy's credit. But in spite of this, it  never seemed to him quite right that Sammy Jay should be so handsomely  dressed.    \"Of course,\" said Peter to Grandfather Frog, \"Old Mother Nature knows  a great deal more than I do--\"    \"Really! You don't mean to say so! Chug-a-rum! You don't mean to say  so, Peter!\" interrupted Grandfather Frog, pretending to be very much  surprised at what Peter said.    [Illustration: \"You don't mean to say so, Peter,\" interrupted  Grandfather Frog.]    Peter grinned and wrinkled his nose at Grandfather Frog.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"Old Mother Nature knows a great deal more than I do,  but it seems to me as if she had made a mistake in giving Sammy Jay  such a handsome coat. There must be a reason, I suppose, but for the  life of me I cannot understand it. I should think that she would give  such a thief as Sammy Jay the very homeliest suit she could find. You  may depend I would, if I were in her place.\"    Grandfather Frog chuckled until he shook all over.    \"It's lucky for some of us that you are not in her place!\" said he.  \"Chug-a-rum! It certainly is lucky!\"    \"If I were, I would give you a handsome coat, too, Grandfather Frog,\"  replied Peter.    Grandfather Frog suddenly swelled out with indignation. \"Chug-a-rum!  Chug-a-rum! What's the matter with the coat I have got, Peter Rabbit?  Tell me that! Who's got a handsomer one?\" Grandfather Frog glared with  his great, goggly eyes at Peter.    \"I didn't mean to say that you haven't got a handsome coat. Your coat  _is_ handsome, very handsome indeed, Grandfather Frog,\" Peter hastened  to say. \"I always did like green. I just love it! And I should think  you would be ever so proud of your white and yellow waistcoat. I would  if it were mine. What I meant to say is, that if I were in Old Mother  Nature's place, I would give some plain folks handsome suits.  Certainly, I wouldn't give such a rascal as Sammy Jay one of the  handsomest coats in all the Green Forest. Knowing Sammy as well as I  do, it is hard work to believe that he came by it honestly.\"    Grandfather Frog chuckled way down deep in his throat.    \"Sammy came by it honestly enough, Peter. Yes,"]]]
