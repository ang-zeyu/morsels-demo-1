If some being bestowed upon men power, activity,  benevolence, strength, it was no doubt the sun, which should be  recognized as the father of nature, as the soul of the world, as  Divinity. At least one could not without folly dispute his existence, or  refuse to recognize his influence and his benefits.          XXV.--A SPIRITUAL GOD IS INCAPABLE OF WILLING AND OF ACTING.    The theologian tells us that God does not need hands or arms to act, and  that He acts by His will alone. But what is this God who has a will? And  what can be the subject of this divine will? Is it more ridiculous or  more difficult to believe in fairies, in sylphs, in ghosts, in witches,  in were-wolfs, than to believe in the magical or impossible action of  the spirit upon the body? As soon as we admit of such a God, there are  no longer fables or visions which can not be believed. The theologians  treat men like children, who never cavil about the possibilities of the  tales which they listen to.          XXVI.--WHAT IS GOD?    To unsettle the existence of a God, it is only necessary to ask a  theologian to speak of Him; as soon as he utters one word about Him, the  least reflection makes us discover at once that what he says is  incompatible with the essence which he attributes to his God. Therefore,  what is God? It is an abstract word, coined to designate the hidden  forces of nature; or, it is a mathematical point, which has neither  length, breadth, nor thickness. A philosopher [David Hume] has very  ingeniously said in speaking of theologians, that they have found the  solution to the famous problem of Archimedes; a point in the heavens  from which they move the world.          XXVII.--REMARKABLE CONTRADICTIONS OF THEOLOGY.    Religion puts men on their knees before a being without extension, and  who, notwithstanding, is infinite, and fills all space with his  immensity; before an almighty being, who never executes that which he  desires; before a being supremely good, and who causes but displeasure;  before a being, the friend of order, and in whose government everything  is in disorder. After all this, let us conjecture what this God of  theology is.          XXVIII.--TO ADORE GOD IS TO ADORE A FICTION.    In order to avoid all embarrassment, they tell us that it is not  necessary to know what God is; that we must adore without knowing; that  it is not permitted us to turn an eye of temerity upon His attributes.  But if we must adore a God without knowing Him, should we not be assured  that He exists? Moreover, how be assured that He exists without having  examined whether it is possible that the diverse qualities claimed for  Him, meet in Him? In truth, to adore God is to adore nothing but  fictions of one's own brain, or rather, it is to adore nothing.          XXIX.--THE INFINITY OF GOD AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF KNOWING THE DIVINE  ESSENCE, OCCASIONS AND JUSTIFIES ATHEISM.    Without doubt the more to perplex matters, theologians have chosen to  say nothing about what their God is; they tell us what He is not. By  negations and abstractions they imagine themselves composing a real and  perfect being, while there can result from it but a being of human  reason. A spirit has no body; an infinite being is a being which is not  finite; a perfect being is a being which is not imperfect. Can any one  form any real notions of such a multitude of deficiencies or absence of  ideas? That which excludes all idea, can it be anything but nothingness?  To pretend that the divine attributes are beyond the understanding of  the human mind is to render God unfit for men. If we are assured that  God is infinite, we admit that there can be nothing in common between  Him and His creatures. To say that God is infinite, is to destroy Him  for men, or at least render Him useless to them.    God, we are told, created men intelligent, but He did not create them  omniscient: that is to say, capable of knowing all things. We conclude  that He was not able to endow him with intelligence sufficient to  understand the divine essence. In this case it is demonstrated that God  has neither the power nor the wish to be known by men. By what right  could this God become angry with beings whose own essence makes it  impossible to have any idea of the divine essence? God would evidently  be the most unjust and the most unaccountable of tyrants if He should  punish an atheist for not knowing that which his nature made it  impossible for him to know.          XXX.--IT IS NEITHER LESS NOR MORE CRIMINAL TO BELIEVE IN GOD THAN NOT TO  BELIEVE IN HIM.    For the generality of men nothing renders an argument more convincing  than fear. In consequence of this fact, theologians tell us that the  safest side must be taken; that nothing is more criminal than  incredulity; that God will punish without mercy all those who have the  temerity to doubt His existence; that His severity is just; since it is  only madness or perversity which questions the existence of an angry  monarch who revenges himself cruelly upon atheists. If we examine these  menaces calmly, we shall find that they assume always the thing in  question. They must commence by proving to our satisfaction the  existence of a God, before telling us that it is safer to believe, and  that it is horrible to doubt or to deny it. Then they must prove that it  is possible for a just God to punish men cruelly for having been in a  state of madness, which prevented them from believing in the existence  of a being whom their enlightened reason could not comprehend. In a  word, they must prove that a God that is said to be full of equity,  could punish beyond measure the invincible and necessary ignorance of  man, caused by his relation to the divine essence. Is not the  theologians' manner of reasoning very singular? They create phantoms,  they fill them with contradictions, and finally assure us that the  safest way is not to doubt the existence of those phantoms, which they  have themselves invented. By following out this method, there is no  absurdity which it would not be safer to believe than not to believe.    All children are atheists--they have no idea of God; are they, then,  criminal on account of this ignorance? At what age do they begin to be  obliged to believe in God? It is, you say, at the age of reason. At what  time does this age begin? Besides, if the most profound theologians lose  themselves in the divine essence, which they boast of not comprehending,  what ideas can common people have?--women, mechanics, and, in short,  those who compose the mass of the human race?          XXXI.--THE BELIEF IN GOD IS NOTHING BUT A MECHANICAL HABITUDE OF  CHILDHOOD.    Men believe in God only upon the word of those who have no more idea of  Him than they themselves. Our nurses are our first theologians; they  talk to children of God as they talk to them of were-wolfs; they teach  them from the most tender age to join the hands mechanically. Have the  nurses clearer notions of God than the children, whom they compel to  pray to Him?          XXXII.--IT IS A PREJUDICE WHICH HAS BEEN HANDED FROM FATHER TO CHILDREN.    Religion is handed down from fathers to children as the property of a  family with the burdens. Very few people in the world would have a God  if care had not been taken to give them one. Each one receives from his  parents and his instructors the God which they themselves have received  from theirs; only, according to his own temperament, each one arranges,  modifies, and paints Him agreeably to his taste.          XXXIII.--ORIGIN OF PREJUDICES.    The brain of man is, especially in infancy, like a soft wax, ready to  receive all the impressions we wish to make on it; education furnishes  nearly all his opinions, at a period when he is incapable of judging for  himself. We believe that the ideas, true or false, which at a tender age  were forced into our heads, were received from nature at our birth; and  this persuasion is one of the greatest sources of our errors.          XXXIV.--HOW THEY TAKE ROOT AND SPREAD.    Prejudice tends to confirm in us the opinions of those who are charged  with our instruction. We believe them more skillful than we are; we  suppose them thoroughly convinced themselves of the things they teach  us. We have the greatest confidence in them. After the care they have  taken of us when we were unable to assist ourselves, we judge them  incapable of deceiving us. These are the motives which make us adopt a  thousand errors without other foundation than the dangerous word of  those who have educated us; even the being forbidden to reason upon what  they tell us, does not diminish our confidence, but contributes often to  increase our respect for their opinions.          XXXV.--MEN WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF MODERN THEOLOGY  IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN TAUGHT AT AN AGE WHEN THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF  REASONING.    The instructors of the human race act very prudently in teaching men  their religious principles before they are able to distinguish the true  from the false, or the left hand from the right. It would be as  difficult to tame the spirit of a man forty years old with the  extravagant notions which are given us of Divinity, as to banish these  notions from the head of a man who has imbibed them since his tenderest  infancy.          XXXVI.--THE WONDERS OF NATURE DO NOT PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF GOD.    We are assured that the wonders of nature are sufficient to a belief in  the existence of a God, and to convince us fully of this important  truth. But how many persons are there in this world who have the  leisure, the capacity, the necessary taste, to contemplate nature and to  meditate upon its progress? The majority of men pay no attention to it.

Let over a running tackle, and we'll have the whole  thing aboard.\"    \"Lively there! Lower the tackle, and don't stand staring with your  mouths open. Swing out those davits.\"    The davits swung out, the tackle ran through the pulleys into the  water with a splash, and the mate shifted the unknown craft, with  its mysterious freight, amidships. A few moments he occupied in  getting the tackle into position.    \"Haul in!\" he shouted.    \"Heave!\" roared the captain, in a state of high excitement; and the  sailors, wrought up to a pitch, heaved with a will.    The captain, Mr. Hume, and Compton, peering over the side, saw a  long, narrow canoe rising up, with the forms of the mate and Venning  standing amidships, and some huddled object aft.    The canoe swung clear of the rails, the tackle was made fast, the  davits swung in, and then the canoe was slowly lowered to the main  deck.    \"Why, it's a man,\" shouted Compton.    \"And a dog,\" muttered the sailors, falling back. \"With a mouthful of  teeth.\"    The mate and Venning stepped out as the canoe reached the deck, and  the mate turned the lantern full on the huddled group, showing a  jackal, with raised mane and bared teeth, crouching over the  prostrate form of a man, whose teeth also were bared, and whose eyes  seemed to glare with the same fury that showed in the flaming green  eyes of the animal.    \"What a pair of demons!\"    \"The man is gagged and bound, captain,\" said Venning.  \"If the cook  will bring a piece of meat for the jackal, I think I can get to the  man without trouble.\"    \"You've done very well, Venning,\" said Mr. Hume, quietly. \"Leave  this matter to me; it is more in my line.\"    With his eyes on the jackal, he placed his hand on the side of the  canoe and moved forward gently while he spoke in Kaffir. \"Peace,  little friend,\" were his words, as he afterwards explained to the  amazed captain. \"We are hunters both, eh? We know each other, eh?  There is no harm in me towards you. You know it, little hunter; you  know it well.\"    It was strange to hear the deep accents of an unknown tongue,  strange to see a man using speech in complete gravity to a wild  animal, but stranger than all to note the effect on the animal  itself.    At first the red mouth opened wide and the green eyes flamed up, but  as the strong hand crept nearer, the glare went out under the steady  gaze of the man's tawny eyes, and next, with a whimper, the jackal  crept forward on its stomach, till the sharp black nose smelt the  man's hand.    \"We are friends, little hunter, we three;\" and the great fingers  passed over the yellow body up towards the face of the bound man.  \"Friends--together--for we are hunters all--you, myself, and this  poor one here with his speech cut off.\" \"We will see to that, eh?\"  The fingers were on the man's face, and with a twist the gag was  out, and the man drew in his breath with a great sob.    \"Ow--ay, that is better; now a little water.\"    Still keeping his eyes fixed on the man and his beast, Mr. Hume held  out a hand for a cup, and with a moistened handkerchief bathed the  cracked and swollen lips. The eyes of both the man and his beast  continued fixed on the hunter, following his every movement, and  never straying to the ring of faces round, showing white in the  glare of the light. The strong fingers moved swiftly here and there,  loosening the hide ropes that bound the legs and arms, and then  rubbing ointment with a strong smell of eucalyptus into the bruised  skin.    \"So--now a little broth for the man, cook, and a scrap of meat for  the jackal. Gently, gently, cook; don't scare them, and don't crowd  in, you others.\"    \"Ay, ay,\" burst out the captain, in a sudden fury. \"What's the whole  ship's company doing here? Is this a garden-party, Mr. Robbins?\"    \"Get forward!\" roared the mate, in a voice that sent the jackal  almost crazy with renewed fright; and at the creature's wild cry the  sailors hurried off, muttering that they had taken a whole cargo of  misfortune aboard.    The hunter looked reproachfully at the mate, who was mounting to the  bridge, and then began once more to soothe the frightened animal,  which in time took a bit of raw meat he proffered.  The man drank  his broth, and then sat up to stare about him with quick glances.  When lying down he had seemed black, but, now that he was in the  light, it was seen that he was more mahogany than black, with a more  prominent nose and thinner lips than are usually found with the  negroid stock. His hair, however, was in little tufts, and the white  of his eyes had the smoky hue of the negro. As he sat, Mr. Hume  rubbed the back of his neck, and fed him with broth, a mouthful at a  time, and as this went on the fierce black eyes again and again  returned from their swift, suspicious range to the hunter's face.    \"He seems to grow stronger,\" said Venning.    \"Fetch a rug from my cabin; we will make him a bed in his own canoe.  He will rest easier there till the morning.\"    The rug was brought, and the man nodded his head as it was arranged  comfortably; then, with another long intent look at the hunter, he  settled himself down with a sigh, spoke a word to his strange  companion, which at once curled itself at his feet, and was asleep.    \"Now, boys,\" said Mr. Hume, \"you go to bed. I will watch here, and  in the morning, maybe, we will find out the mystery.\"    In the morning the steamer was on the yellow waters of the Congo,  and the boys forgot even about the strange couple in their first  view of the mighty river; but the sight of a native-manned canoe,  shooting out from the mist which hung in wisp over the waters,  recalled the incident. They found Mr. Hume in an easy-chair,  drinking his early morning cup of coffee, and at his feet,  stretching along the scuppers, was the canoe, still with its crew  aboard and asleep, though the jackal slept apparently with one eye  open.  The canoe was, they saw, made out of a single tree-trunk, and  was thickly coated with the slime of the river, a heavy, sodden,  roughly shaped craft, most unlike the light boat that skimmed into  view from out the mist.    \"What do you make of it?\" said Mr. Hume, after the two boys had made  a long inspection.    \"It seems to me,\" said Venning, \"that the jackal has a very dark  coat.\"    \"That is so; it is unusually dark. What does that suggest to you?\"    \"Well, as the colour is adapted to the nature of the country in  which the animal hunts, I should say that the jackal came from a  wooded district.\"    \"Good. And what is your opinion, Compton?\"    Compton bent down to examine the bows.  \"Look here, sir,\" he said;  \"there is a prayer to Allah carved in Arabic on a leaden medallion,  and fixed into the wood.\"    \"Is that so?\" and the hunter looked at the signs with interest. \"I  had not seen that. And it means----\"    \"That Arabs had something to do with the making of the canoe.\"    \"Umph! I doubt very much if it is Arab-built. That talisman may have  been found by a native and fixed on--though that is impossible;\" and  Mr. Hume pondered. \"The Arabs may have taken the canoe from the  native owner and fixed in the medallion.\"    \"He's awake,\" said Venning; and the three of them saw that the man,  without so much as a movement of surprise at his awakening under  such altered circumstances, was keenly observing them.    After he had gravely inspected each in turn, he sat up and raised  his hand in salutation. The rug slipped off his shoulders, showing  his bare breast, with every rib exposed, and clearly outlined in  blue was the form of an animal.    \"A totem!\" exclaimed the hunter.    \"Otter,\" said Venning.    \"Ask the steward if he has the porridge ready that I ordered.\"    Venning ran off, and returned with a basin of thick oatmeal  porridge. The man took it gravely, made another salutation, and ate  the whole.    \"There's nothing wrong with him,\" said Mr. Hume, with a smile. \"Now  we'll get him out of that and fix him up comfortably. I like his  looks, and have hopes that he will be useful.\"    They removed him to a deck-chair, whither he was followed by the  jackal, who was in such a state of  suspicion that he declined food.    \"What I think,\" said Mr. Hume, in answer to the boys, who wanted his  explanation, \"is this--that the man and the jackal have come from  the interior.\"    \"From the Great Forest?\"    \"Probably from the Great Forest; for these reasons--that the men who  shaped the canoe had no knowledge of the coast-built craft with  their high bows; that the man is of a different race from the coast  tribes; and because the jackal, from his dark markings, is evidently  from a thickly wooded region. That is merely a theory, which does  not help us much, and certainly does not explain how he came to be  bound and gagged in a canoe at sea hundreds of miles from the  forest. However, the main point is that we have got him, and having  got him, will keep him.\"    \"Against his will, sir?\"    \"Oh, I reckon he will be only too thankful for our protection.\"    \"I should think, sir,\" said Venning, \"the fact of his totem being an  otter proves that his tribe derives its living mainly from fish.\"    \"That is plausible; but it may, again, be a sign of chieftainship,  and a chief I have no doubt he is. Maybe he was sent adrift by some  rival faction; but that can scarcely be, for he would not have  survived a long journey; and, again, the canoe would have gone  aground.\"    \"There is another explanation,\" said Compton, with a grin. \"He may  not have come down the river at all. He may have been set adrift  from one of those ships we passed for insubordination.\"    \"Ships do not carry canoes or jackals,\" said Venning, who had made  up his mind that the castaway was from the forest, and from nowhere  else.    They went down to breakfast, and the morning was occupied in getting  their kit and"]]]
