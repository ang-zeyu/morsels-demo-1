He is enthusiastic about the beauty of  Bechuanaland, and spoke of having seen parts of it in which the charms  of English scenery are to be found, and even greater attractions than in  many gentlemen's parks in the Old Country. His opinion of the climate is  very high. He told me he would on no account exchange his present  location, with its dry, pure, and bracing air, so healthful,  invigorating, and free, for the chill, and damps, and fogs of England.  Mr. Drake was in England during the year 1887 (the Jubilee year), but  he was glad to get back again to his home on the border of  Bechuanaland--a very comfortable one, as I can testify from my own  personal experience.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    BECHUANALAND.      I was very much struck with the appearance of the country on first  entering Bechuanaland. The vast plain, over which I was then riding on  horseback, was bounded by low, sloping hills, covered with brushwood and  trees. It suggested to me forcibly the idea of a \"land of promise,\"  wanting only an intelligent and energetic people to secure its proper  and successful development.    In fact, as a field for settlement, I entirely concur with the remarks  of Mr. John Mackenzie, who has worked for so many years in  Bechuanaland, and who states in his recent work, entitled, \"Austral  Africa\"--         \"I come now to give my own thoughts as to the capabilities of       Bechuanaland as a field for colonisation. My mind reverts at once       to thrifty, and laborious people who are battling for dear-life on       some small holding in England or Scotland, and who can barely make       ends meet. I do not think that any class of men, or men of any       colour, endure such hardships in South Africa. There are portions       of Bechuanaland where, in my opinion, a body of some hundreds of       agricultural emigrants would, like the Scottish settlers in       Baviaan's river, some sixty years ago, take root from the first,       and make for themselves homes. If they came in considerable       numbers, and accompanied by a minister of religion, and possibly a       schoolmaster, the children would not be losers by the change, while       the church and school-house would form that centre in South       Africa, with which all are familiar in Scotland, and give the       people from the first a feeling of home. I would not suggest that       such men should be merely agriculturists, but that like most       farmers in South Africa they should follow both branches of       farming. They would begin with some sheep, or angora goats, and a       few cows. In the first instance they would have a freehold in the       village, with right of pasturage, and they would also have their       farm itself in the neighbourhood, the size of which would depend       upon its locality and capabilities. But with the milk of his stock       and the produce of his land in maize, millet and pumpkins, the       farmer and his family would be, from the first, beyond the reach of       want.\"    For two days more we travelled through the same kind of country, a fine,  bold, and very extensive plain (a promising district for cattle  farming), with rolling and undulating hills in the distance, till we  reached Vryburg, about a hundred and forty-five miles--in four  days--from Kimberley. This is the capital of British Bechuanaland, and  the head-quarters of Sir Sidney Shippard, the Administrator. The town  itself contains about 500 inhabitants, chiefly Europeans. Here we spent  four days. On one of these I was taken by Mr. M---- to visit his fine  Bechuanaland farm of 6,000 morgen--12,000 acres--which he has named  \"Lochnagar.\" We left Vryburg at 7.30 a.m., and drove about twelve miles  in the direction of Kuruman, reaching Lochnagar Farm about 10 o'clock.  While breakfast was preparing, Mr. M---- took me round the nearest part  of this excellent and valuable farm. He has had it about three years,  and he has already shown the wonderful capabilities for development  which an enterprising proprietor, possessed of some capital, can evolve  from farms in Bechuanaland. He first took me into his fruit garden,  which he has stocked with fruits of all descriptions. I was particularly  struck with the healthy appearance of the wood (it was then the middle  of winter) of the trees of all sorts of fruit. He has planted mulberry,  apple, pear, apricot, peach, orange, citron, and several other fruits,  all of which seem to be growing fast, and taking root vigorously in the  soil. A large space is also devoted to a vineyard, as well as another to  an orchard.    The farm is well irrigated, there being an abundance of water on it, as  I myself saw. After breakfast we walked round the cattle lair, where a  large portion of his 200 head of cattle were collected. I was much  impressed with the fine appearance of the stock. Large-framed, stalwart  oxen, and fat milch cows were round me on every side during my  inspection. I did not notice a single animal that was not in capital  condition, and fit for the market--if market there could only be. I next  went through a large enclosure, in which there were about forty horses,  part of the eighty belonging to Mr. M----. Here I saw several  three-year-olds, and brood mares, and colts, all looking well and  healthy, and containing several good, well-shaped, and promising  specimens of young horseflesh. Mr. M---- has also a flock of one  thousand sheep on his farm, but these I did not see, as they were out  grazing on the veldt. We then walked to another portion of the farm,  lying close to the capital house, built of stone by Mr. M----, to a  large \"pan,\" or lake, in which there were fish caught with a net. These  are a sort of carp, and a black-coloured fish of seven pounds or eight  pounds weight, said to be very good eating. I saw in an outhouse a small  collapsible boat, which is sometimes used on the lake. In summer, I am  told, the farm looks very pretty, with its long stretches of bright  green herbage, and wild flowers, and sunny aspect.    Mr. M---- was born at Cape Town. He is of Dutch origin, and is a fine,  stalwart-looking man with great energy of character and keen  intelligence. He seems well fitted to be a pioneer farmer, to develop  the too-long neglected resources of this fertile land. He is about  forty-five years of age, and a bachelor. He first arrived on his farm on  a Saturday night three years ago, and the next day commenced tree  planting. His first trees were thus planted on a Sunday Morning. This  was a good omen of the success he deserves, as I remarked to him.    While I was at Vryburg I was also taken by the proprietor of the Vryburg  Hotel to see a farm about five miles off, where they were prospecting  for gold. Mr. H---- informed me that the reef I saw, was the same  description of rock, I should see at Johannesburg. The people in this  neighbourhood are very sanguine; I was told that this may prove a great  discovery for Bechuanaland.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    KLERKSDORP.      Having received the same hospitable attention, as elsewhere, at Vryburg,  our wagon party once more resumed its journey. Thirty miles brought us  to the south-western frontier of the Transvaal, from whence we travelled  on, through the most dreary, flat, uninteresting, barren, treeless  plain, for two or three days more, sleeping every night on the veldt,  until we reached Klerksdorp, about 120 miles from Vryburg. The  south-western part of the Transvaal is certainly exceedingly inferior in  appearance to what I saw in Bechuanaland. We remained at Klerksdorp  three days. While there I visited one or two of the gold mines of this  promising district.    At the Nooitgedacht Mine I saw the process performed of pan washing of  the previously crushed quartz. I also went to the stamping house, where  a machine for crushing has been erected of twenty stamps. I inspected  the mine generally, and its various shafts already sunk. The work  appeared to me to be well and systematically conducted. Before leaving  this mine the great gold cake lump, weighing 1,370 ozs., which was being  forwarded, the day I was there, to the Paris Exhibition, was put into my  hands. It seemed a wonderfully big lump of the precious metal, which is  so earnestly sought for by every race of civilised man.    I also went over another mine, at present in the early stage of its  development, but which struck me as being conducted, as far as the  working management was concerned, on good, sound, business  principles--belonging to the Klerksdorp Gold Estates Company.    My stay at Klerksdorp much impressed me with the idea of the future of  this town of yesterday's growth. It is only fifteen months ago, (a  little more than a year) that the whole of the town on the side of the  stream where the Union Hotel is situated, was begun. The inhabitants  already number some thousands; and the indications I have seen in the  mines, of great prospects of gold being found in large and payable  quantities, are very strong. Klerksdorp may yet become a second  Johannesburg, whose remarkable and rapid development I was told, would  astonish me.          [Illustration: Decorative]    POTCHEFSTROOM.      After leaving Klerksdorp, we travelled the next day in our wagon  thirty-two miles, halting for the night at Potchefstroom, which is not  only one of the oldest, but one of the most important of the Transvaal  districts. Recently the presence of gold-bearing reefs has been  demonstrated in many parts of the division. On our way we passed, during  the afternoon, a spot on the road where a flock of not less than fifty  of those unclean birds, vultures, were hovering over and around the  carcase of a recently dead bullock. These birds are the scavengers of  this part"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],[0,"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#5)"],[1,"in Europe, but the sea  was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference.    The 20th of July, the tropic of Capricorn was cut by 105d of longitude,  and the 27th of the same month we crossed the Equator on the 110th  meridian.  This passed, the frigate took a more decided westerly  direction, and scoured the central waters of the Pacific.  Commander  Farragut thought, and with reason, that it was better to remain in deep  water, and keep clear of continents or islands, which the beast itself  seemed to shun (perhaps because there was not enough water for him!  suggested the greater part of the crew). The frigate passed at some  distance from the Marquesas and the Sandwich Islands, crossed the  tropic of Cancer, and made for the China Seas.  We were on the theatre  of the last diversions of the monster:  and, to say truth, we no longer  LIVED on board.  The entire ship's crew were undergoing a nervous  excitement, of which I can give no idea:  they could not eat, they  could not sleep--twenty times a day, a misconception or an optical  illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail, would cause dreadful  perspirations, and these emotions, twenty times repeated, kept us in a  state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable.    And truly, reaction soon showed itself.  For three months, during which  a day seemed an age, the Abraham Lincoln furrowed all the waters of the  Northern Pacific, running at whales, making sharp deviations from her  course, veering suddenly from one tack to another, stopping suddenly,  putting on steam, and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging  her machinery, and not one point of the Japanese or American coast was  left unexplored.    The warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent  detractors.  Reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself, and  certainly, had it not been for the resolute determination on the part  of Captain Farragut, the frigate would have headed due southward.  This  useless search could not last much longer.  The Abraham Lincoln had  nothing to reproach herself with, she had done her best to succeed.  Never had an American ship's crew shown more zeal or patience; its  failure could not be placed to their charge--there remained nothing but  to return.    This was represented to the commander.  The sailors could not hide  their discontent, and the service suffered.  I will not say there was a  mutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of obstinacy, Captain  Farragut (as Columbus did) asked for three days' patience.  If in three  days the monster did not appear, the man at the helm should give three  turns of the wheel, and the Abraham Lincoln would make for the European  seas.    This promise was made on the 2nd of November.  It had the effect of  rallying the ship's crew.  The ocean was watched with renewed  attention.  Each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his  remembrance.  Glasses were used with feverish activity.  It was a grand  defiance given to the giant narwhal, and he could scarcely fail to  answer the summons and \"appear.\"    Two days passed, the steam was at half pressure; a thousand schemes  were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the  animal in case it should be met in those parts.  Large quantities of  bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship, to the great satisfaction  (I must say) of the sharks.  Small craft radiated in all directions  round the Abraham Lincoln as she lay to, and did not leave a spot of  the sea unexplored.  But the night of the 4th of November arrived  without the unveiling of this submarine mystery.    The next day, the 5th of November, at twelve, the delay would (morally  speaking) expire; after that time, Commander Farragut, faithful to his  promise, was to turn the course to the south-east and abandon for ever  the northern regions of the Pacific.    The frigate was then in 31 deg. 15' N. lat. and 136 deg. 42' E. long.  The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred miles to  leeward.  Night was approaching.  They had just struck eight bells;  large clouds veiled the face of the moon, then in its first quarter.  The sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel.    At that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting.  Conseil, standing near me, was looking straight before him.  The crew,  perched in the ratlines, examined the horizon which contracted and  darkened by degrees.  Officers with their night glasses scoured the  growing darkness:  sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the  moon, which darted between two clouds, then all trace of light was lost  in the darkness.    In looking at Conseil, I could see he was undergoing a little of the  general influence.  At least I thought so.  Perhaps for the first time  his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity.    \"Come, Conseil,\" said I, \"this is the last chance of pocketing the two  thousand dollars.\"    \"May I be permitted to say, sir,\" replied Conseil, \"that I never  reckoned on getting the prize; and, had the government of the Union  offered a hundred thousand dollars, it would have been none the poorer.\"    \"You are right, Conseil.  It is a foolish affair after all, and one  upon which we entered too lightly.  What time lost, what useless  emotions!  We should have been back in France six months ago.\"    \"In your little room, sir,\" replied Conseil, \"and in your museum, sir;  and I should have already classed all your fossils, sir.  And the  Babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the Jardin des  Plantes, and have drawn all the curious people of the capital!\"    \"As you say, Conseil.  I fancy we shall run a fair chance of being  laughed at for our pains.\"    \"That's tolerably certain,\" replied Conseil, quietly; \"I think they  will make fun of you, sir.  And, must I say it----?\"    \"Go on, my good friend.\"    \"Well, sir, you will only get your deserts.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"When one has the honour of being a _savant_ as you are, sir, one should  not expose one's self to----\"    Conseil had not time to finish his compliment.  In the midst of general  silence a voice had just been heard.  It was the voice of Ned Land  shouting:    \"Look out there!  The very thing we are looking for--on our weather  beam!\"        CHAPTER VI    AT FULL STEAM    At this cry the whole ship's crew hurried towards the  harpooner--commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys; even the  engineers left their engines, and the stokers their furnaces.    The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate now simply went  on by her own momentum.  The darkness was then profound, and, however  good the Canadian's eyes were, I asked myself how he had managed to  see, and what he had been able to see.  My heart beat as if it would  break.  But Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all perceived the object  he pointed to.  At two cables' length from the Abraham Lincoln, on the  starboard quarter, the sea seemed to be illuminated all over.  It was  not a mere phosphoric phenomenon.  The monster emerged some fathoms  from the water, and then threw out that very intense but mysterious  light mentioned in the report of several captains.  This magnificent  irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great SHINING power.  The luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval, much elongated,  the centre of which condensed a burning heat, whose overpowering  brilliancy died out by successive gradations.    \"It is only a massing of phosphoric particles,\" cried one of the  officers.    \"No, sir, certainly not,\" I replied.  \"That brightness is of an  essentially electrical nature.  Besides, see, see! it moves; it is  moving forwards, backwards; it is darting towards us!\"    A general cry arose from the frigate.    \"Silence!\" said the captain.  \"Up with the helm, reverse the engines.\"    The steam was shut off, and the Abraham Lincoln, beating to port,  described a semicircle.    \"Right the helm, go ahead,\" cried the captain.    These orders were executed, and the frigate moved rapidly from the  burning light.    I was mistaken.  She tried to sheer off, but the supernatural animal  approached with a velocity double her own.    We gasped for breath.  Stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and  motionless.  The animal gained on us, sporting with the waves.  It made  the round of the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots, and  enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust.    Then it moved away two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent track,  like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind.  All  at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain  its momentum, the monster rushed suddenly towards the Abraham Lincoln  with alarming rapidity, stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the  hull, and died out--not diving under the water, for its brilliancy did  not abate--but suddenly, and as if the source of this brilliant  emanation was exhausted.  Then it reappeared on the other side of the  vessel, as if it had turned and slid under the hull.  Any moment a  collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us.  However, I was astonished at the manoeuvres of the frigate.  She fled  and did not attack.    On the captain's face, generally so impassive, was an expression of  unaccountable astonishment.    \"Mr. Aronnax,\" he said, \"I do not know with what formidable being I  have to deal, and I will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst  of this darkness.  Besides, how attack this unknown thing, how defend  one's self from it?  Wait for daylight, and the scene will change.\"    \"You have no further doubt, captain, of the nature of the animal?\"    \"No, sir; it is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an electric one.\"    \"Perhaps,\" added I, \"one can only approach it with a torpedo.\"    \"Undoubtedly,\" replied the captain, \"if it possesses such dreadful  power, it is the most terrible animal that"]]]
