[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18019"],[0,"The Luckiest Girl in the School (#5)"],[1,"to try and forget it now.\"    Winona nodded good-by to her fellow candidates, and took her leave. How  many of them would she see again, she wondered, and which among all the  number would have the luck?    \"Certainly not myself,\" she thought ruefully. \"I know my papers weren't  up to standard. I believe that red-haired girl will be one. She looked  clever!\"    Winona had spent the preceding night with Aunt Harriet, who offered to  keep her until the result of the examination should be published, but  the prospect of spending a week of suspense at Abbey Close was so  formidable, that she had begged to be allowed to return home, excusing  herself on the plea that she would like to be with Percy during the  remainder of his holidays. It was a very subdued Winona who reached  Highfield next afternoon.    \"Hello, Tiddleywinks! You've lost the starch out of you!\" Percy greeted  her. \"Did they say they wouldn't have you at any price?\"    \"The result won't be out till the fifteenth, but I expect I've failed,\"  answered Winona gloomily.    \"Buck up, young 'un! Look at yours truly! I fail nine times out of ten,  and do I take it to heart?\"    Winona laughed in spite of herself. Percy's complacency over small  achievements was proverbial. But she had higher ambitions, and the cloud  of depression soon settled down again. Her temper, not always her strong  point, displayed a degree of irritability that drove her family to the  verge of mutiny.    \"Really, Winona, I don't remember you so fractious since you were  cutting your teeth!\" complained her much-tried mother.    The days dragged slowly by. Winona had never before realized that each  hour could hold so many minutes. On the morning of the 15th she came  down to breakfast with dark rings round her eyes.    \"I shall be glad to be put out of my misery!\" she thought, as the  postman's rap-tap sounded at the door.    Mamie made a rush for the letter-box, and returned bearing a foolscap  envelope addressed to:                                       MISS WINONA WOODWARD,                                               Highfield,                                                    Ashbourne,                                                      nr. Great Marston.    Winona opened it with trembling fingers. But as she read, her face  flushed and her eyes sparkled.    \"I have much pleasure in informing you\" (so ran the letter) \"that the  Governors of the Seaton High School have decided to award you a  Scholarship tenable for two years....\"    In silence she passed the paper to her mother.    \"Congratulations, dear child!\" cried Mrs. Woodward, clapping her hands.  \"It's the unexpected that happens!\"    \"Oh, my goodness!\" ejaculated Percy. \"You never mean to tell me that  Tiddleywinks has actually been and gone and won!\"          CHAPTER III    Seaton High School      The autumn term at Seaton High School began on September 22nd. On the  21st Winona set forth with great flourish of trumpets, feeling more or  less of a heroine. To have been selected for a scholarship among  twenty-one candidates was a distinction that even Aunt Harriet would  admit. In the brief interval pending her departure, her home circle had  treated her with a respect they had never before accorded her.    \"I hope you'll do well, child,\" said her mother, half proud and half  tearful when it came to the parting. \"We shall miss you here, but when  you get on yourself you must help the younger ones. I shall look to you  to push them on in life.\"    There is a certain satisfaction in the knowledge that you are considered  the prop of the family. Winona's eyes glowed. In imagination she was  already Principal of a large school, and providing posts as assistant  mistresses for Letty, Mamie and Doris, that is to say unless she turned  her attention to medicine, but in that case she could be head of a  Women's Hospital, and have them as house surgeons or dispensers, or  something else equally distinguished and profitable. It might even be  possible to provide occupation for Godfrey or Ernie, though this was  likely to prove a tougher job than placing the girls. With such a  brilliant beginning, the future seemed an easy walk-over.    Mrs. Woodward was exulting over the fact that she had engaged Miss Jones  when she did, and that Winona's school clothes were all made and  finished. There had been a fluster at the last, when it was discovered  that her mackintosh was fully six inches too short for her new skirts,  and that she had outgrown her thick boots, but a hurried visit to Great  Marston had remedied these deficiencies, and the box was packed to  everybody's satisfaction. There was a universal feeling in the family  that such an outfit could not fail to meet with Aunt Harriet's approval.  The first sight of the nightdress case and the brush-and-comb bag must  wring admiration from her. They had been bought at a bazaar, and were  altogether superior to those in daily use. As for the handkerchief case,  Letty had decided that unless one equally well embroidered were  presented to her on her next birthday, she would be obliged to assert  her individuality by showing temper.    Winona walked into the dressing-room of the High School on September  22nd with a mixture of shyness and importance. On the whole the latter  predominated. It was a trifle embarrassing to face so many strangers,  but it was something to have won a scholarship. She wondered who was the  other fortunate candidate.    \"I expect it will be that red-haired girl with the spectacles,\" she  thought. \"I believe she answered every question, though she was rather  quiet about it.\"    She looked round, but could not see the ruddy locks, nor indeed any of  the companions who had taken the examination with her.    \"Hunting for some one you know?\" asked a girl who had appropriated the  next hook to hers.    \"Yes, at least I'm not sure whether she'll be here or not. I believe her  name's Marjorie Kaye.\"    \"Never heard of her!\"    \"There are heaps of new girls,\" volunteered another who stood by.    \"I wondered if she'd won a County Scholarship,\" added Winona.    \"Ask me a harder! I tell you I've never heard her name before.\"    \"I've won the other scholarship.\"    Winona's voice was intended to sound very casual.    \"Indeed!\"    Her neighbor was taking off her boots, and did not seem as much  impressed as the occasion merited.    \"Oh! so you're one of the 'outlanders,'\" sniggered another. \"It's a sort  of 'go into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in'  business.\"    \"I suppose we shall be having Council School Scholarships next!\" drawled  a third.    They were friends, and went off together without another glance at  Winona. She followed soberly, wondering what she ought to do next. She  had a vague idea that the winner of a scholarship should present herself  at the Head Mistress' study to receive a few words of encouragement and  congratulation on her success. At the top of the stairs she met the  mistress who had presided over the examination. The latter greeted her  unceremoniously.    \"Winona Woodward, you've been placed in V.a., first room to the  right, round the corner. You'll find the number on the door.\"    Other girls were hurrying in the same direction. Winona entered with  what seemed to her quite a small crowd. Everybody appeared to know where  to go, except herself. She stood in such evident hesitation that one,  more good-natured than the rest, remarked:    \"You'd better seize on any desk you fancy, as quick as you can. They're  getting taken up fast, if you want a front one!\"    Winona slid into the nearest seat at hand, and appropriated it by  placing her note-book, pencil-box, ruler, atlas and dictionaries inside  the desk.    The room was filling quickly. Every moment fresh arrivals hurried in and  took their places. Marjorie Kaye was nowhere to be seen, but in the  second row sat the dark-eyed girl with the red ribbon in her hair. She  turned round and nodded pleasantly.    \"So she's got the other scholarship!\" thought Winona. \"I shouldn't have  expected it. I'd have staked my reputation on the sandy-haired one.  Well, I suppose her answers weren't correct, after all. I'm rather glad  on the whole it's this girl; she looks jolly.\"    At that moment Miss Huntley, the form mistress, entered and took the  call-over, and the day's work began. Each girl was given a time-table  and a list of the books she would require, and after that, class  succeeded class until one o'clock, with a ten minutes' interval for  lunch at eleven. The conclusion of the morning left Winona with a  profound respect for High School methods. After the easy-going routine  of Miss Harmon's it was like stepping into a new educational world. She  supposed she would be able to keep pace with it when she got her books,  but the mathematics, at any rate, were much more advanced than what she  had before attempted. As she walked down the corridor, the girl with the  red hair-ribbon overtook her, and claimed acquaintance.    \"So you're Winona Woodward? And I'm Garnet Emerson. We had the luck,  after all! I'm sure I never expected to win. It was the greatest  surprise to me when the letter arrived. Yes, five of the other  candidates are at school, but they've been put in IV.a., and  IV.b. Marjorie Kaye? You mean that girl in spectacles? No,  she's not come. I heard her say that if she didn't win she was to be  sent somewhere else. Where are you staying? With an aunt? I'm with a  second cousin. She's nice, but I wish they'd open a hostel; it would be  topping to be with a heap of others, wouldn't it? We'd get up acting in  the evenings, and all sorts of fun. Well, perhaps that may come later  on. I shall see you this afternoon, shan't I?\"    \"Yes, I'm coming for my books. It's too late to stop and get them now.\"    Afternoon attendance at the High School was not nominally compulsory.  All the principal subjects were taken in the morning, but there were  classes "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18050"],[0,"The House Fly and How to Suppress It (#5)"],[1,"make the heap unfavorable for the  development of fly larvae. Those which do happen to develop in the  surface layers will migrate and pupate in the ring of straw around the  heap, where they are destroyed by burning.      GARBAGE DISPOSAL AND TREATMENT OF MISCELLANEOUS BREEDING PLACES.    It is just as true under farm conditions as in cities that breeding  places other than horse manure must be attended to. Garbage must be  disposed of, hog and poultry manure must be cared for, and especially on  dairy farms it is extremely important that every precaution be taken to  prevent the contamination of milk by flies.    It is very desirable that all refuse possible, accumulated from cities  and towns, be burned. Incineration has been practiced successfully by a  number of towns and cities with populations of from 10,000 to 15,000 and  over. In larger cities provision should be made for burning carcasses as  well as garbage and other refuse. If city and town garbage is sold to  hog feeders the municipal authorities should have control of the  sanitary conditions about the feeding yards, as there is great danger  from fly breeding in such places if not kept clean.      SEWAGE DISPOSAL IN RELATION TO THE PREVENTION OF FLY-BORNE DISEASES.    In the consideration of these measures we have not touched upon the  remedies for house flies breeding in human excrement. On account of the  danger of the carriage of typhoid fever, the dropping of human excrement  in the open in cities or towns, either in vacant lots or in dark  alleyways, should be made a misdemeanor, and the same care should be  taken by the sanitary authorities to remove or cover up such depositions  as is taken in the removal of the bodies of dead animals. For modern  methods of sewage disposal adapted for farm use one should consult  Department of Agriculture Department Bulletin No. 57. In the absence of  modern methods of sewage disposal, absolutely sanitary privies are prime  necessities, whether in towns or on farms. Directions for building and  caring for such privies will be found in Farmers' Bulletin 463 and in  Yearbook Separate 712, \"Sewage Disposal on the Farm.\" The box privy is  always a nuisance from many points of view, and is undoubtedly dangerous  as a breeder of flies which may carry the germs of intestinal diseases.  The dry-earth treatment of privies is unsatisfactory. No box privy  should be permitted to exist unless it is thoroughly and regularly  treated with some effective larvicide. Since the fecal matter in such  privies is seldom used for fertilizing purposes it may well be treated  liberally with borax. The powdered borax may be scattered two or three  times a week over the exposed surface so as to whiten it.          WHAT COMMUNITIES CAN DO TO ELIMINATE THE HOUSE FLY.      Antifly crusades have been very numerous in recent years, and some have  been noteworthy both in methods and in results. However, it will not be  amiss here to emphasize the importance of concerted, organized effort on  the part of whole communities, not only cities, but suburban and rural  neighborhoods as well. By the most painstaking care one may prevent all  fly breeding on his premises, but it will avail him little if his  neighbors are not equally careful. Some sort of cooperation is  necessary. One of the first and most important elements in any antifly  crusade is a vigorous and continued educational campaign. It has been  the experience of those who have undertaken such crusades that people  generally regard the fly as a somewhat harmless nuisance and that the  first work of the campaign was to bring the people to a realization of  the dangers from flies and the possibility of getting rid of them. In  the educational campaign every possible means of publicity can be  employed, including newspapers, lectures, moving pictures, posters,  handbills, cartoons, instruction in schools, etc.    The antifly crusade is a matter of public interest and should be  supported by the community as a whole and engineered by the health  officers. But health officers can do little toward the necessary work of  inspection and elimination without funds, and therefore the support of  the campaign must manifest itself in increased appropriations for  public-health work. Very often it is lack of funds which prevents the  health officers from taking the initiative in the antifly crusades, and  there must necessarily be much agitation and education before they can  profitably take up the work. Right here lies a field for civic  associations, women's clubs, boards of trade, etc., to exercise their  best energy, initiative, and leadership.
