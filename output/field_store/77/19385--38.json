For some days after emergence the  cuticle of the dragon-fly has a dull pale hue, as compared with the dark  or brightly metallic aspect that characterises it when fully mature. The  life of the imago endures but a short time compared with the long  aquatic larval and nymphal stages. After some weeks, or at most a few  months, the dragon-flies, having paired and laid their eggs, die before  the approach of winter.    [Illustration: Fig. 8 _a, b_. Dragon-fly (_Aeschna cyanea_). Two stages  in emergence of fly from nymph-cuticle. From Latter's _Natural  History_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8 _c_. Dragon-fly emerged, wings  expanding. From Latter's _Natural History_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8 _d_. Dragon-fly (_Aeschna cyanea_) with  expanded wings.]    The life-story of a may-fly follows the same general course as that just  described for the dragon-flies, but there are some suggestive  differences. In the first place, we notice a wider divergence between  the imago and the larva. An adult may-fly is one of the most delicate  of insects; the head has elaborate compound eyes, but the feelers are  very short, and the jaws are reduced to such tiny vestiges that the  insect is unable to feed. Its aquatic larva is fairly robust, with a  large head which is provided with well-developed jaws, as the larval and  nymphal stages extend over one or two years, and the insects browse on  water-weeds or devour creatures smaller and weaker than themselves. They  breathe dissolved air by means of thread-like or plate-like gills  traversed by branching air-tubes, somewhat resembling those of the  demoiselle dragon-fly larva. But in the may-fly larva, there is a series  of these gills (fig. 9_b_) arranged laterally in pairs on the abdominal  segments, and C. Boerner (1909) has recently given reasons, from the  position and muscular attachments of these organs, for believing that  they show a true correspondence to (in technical phraseology are  homologous with) the thoracic legs. One feature in which the larva often  agrees with the imago is the possession on the terminal abdominal  segment of a pair of long jointed cerci, and in many genera a median  jointed tail-process (see fig. 9) is also present, in some cases both in  the larva and the imago, in others in the larva during its later stages  only. The prolonged larval life in may-flies often involves a large  series of moults; Lubbock (1863) has enumerated twenty-one in the  life-history of Chloeon. In the second year of aquatic life  wing-rudiments (fig. 9 _a_) are visible, and the larva becomes a nymph.  When the time for the winged condition approaches the nymphs leave the  water in large swarms. The vivid accounts of these swarms given by  Swammerdam (1675), de Reaumur (1742) and other old-time observers are  available in summarised form for English readers in Miall's admirable  book (1895). May-flies are eagerly sought as food by trout, and the rise  of the fly on many lakes ushers in a welcome season to the angler.    The nymph-cuticle opens and the winged insect emerges. But this is not  the final instar; may-flies are exceptional among insects in undergoing  yet another moult after they have acquired wings which they can use for  flight. The instar that emerges from the nymph-cuticle is a sub-imago,  dull in hue, with a curious immature aspect about it. A few hours later  the final moult takes place, a very delicate cuticle being shed and  revealing the true imago. Then follow the dancing flight over the calm  waters, the mating and egg-laying, the rapid death. The whole winged  existence prepared for by the long aquatic life may be over in a single  evening; at most it lasts but for a few days.    [Illustration: Fig. 9. Nymph of May-fly (_Chloeon dipterum_) showing on  right side wing-rudiment (_a_), on left tracheal gills (_b_). Magnified  4 times. [Feelers and legs are cut short.] From Miall and Denny after  Vayssiere.]    In the development of the may-flies, then, we notice not only a  considerable divergence between larva and imago, both in habitat and  structure; we see also what is to be observed often in more highly  organised insects--a feeding stage prolonged through the years of larval  and nymphal life, while the winged imago takes no food and devotes its  energies through its short existence to the task of reproduction. Such  division of the life-history into a long feeding, and a short breeding  period has, as will be seen later, an important bearing on the question  of insect transformation generally, and the dragon-flies and may-flies  afford examples of two stages in its specialisation. The sub-imaginal  instar of the may-fly furnishes also a noteworthy fact for comparison  with other insect histories. In two points, however, the life-story of  these flies with their aquatic larvae recalls that of the cockroach. All  the larval and nymphal instars are active, and the wing-rudiments are  outwardly visible long before the final moult.          CHAPTER V    TRANSFORMATIONS,--OUTWARD AND INWARD      We are now in a position to study in some detail the transformation of  those insects whose life-story corresponds more or less closely with  that of the butterfly, sketched in the opening pages of this little  book. In the case of some of the insects reviewed in the last three  chapters, the may-flies and cicads for example, a marked difference  between the larva and the imago has been noticed; in others, as the  coccids, we find a resting instar before the winged condition is  assumed, suggesting the pupal stage in the butterfly's life-story.    The various insect orders whose members exhibit no marked divergence  between larva and imago (the Orthoptera for example) are often said to  undergo no transformation, to be 'Ametabola.' Those with life-stories  such as the dragon-flies' are said to undergo partial transformation,  and are termed 'Hemimetabola.' Moths, caddis-flies, beetles, two-winged  flies, saw-flies, ants, wasps, bees, and the great majority of insects,  having the same type of life-story as the butterfly, are said to undergo  complete transformation and are classed as 'Metabola' or 'Holometabola.'  Wherein lies the fundamental difference between these Holometabola on  the one hand and the Hemimetabola and Ametabola on the other? It is not  that the larva differs from the imago or that there is a passive stage  in the life-history; these conditions are observable among insects with  a 'partial' transformation as we have seen, though the resting instar  that simulates the butterfly pupa is certainly exceptional. It has been  pointed out by Sharp (1899) that the most important indication of the  difference between the two modes of development is furnished by the  position of the wing-rudiments. In all Ametabola and Hemimetabola these  are visible externally long before the penultimate instar has been  reached; in the Holometabola they are not seen until the pupal stage.    Attention has already been drawn to the contrast in outward form between  a butterfly and its caterpillar. As in the case of dragon-fly or  may-fly, the larval period is essentially a time for feeding and growth,  and during this period the larval cuticle is cast four or five, in some  species even seven or eight times. After each moult some changes in  detail may be observable, for example in the proportions of the  body-segments or their outgrowths, in the colour or the closeness of the  hairy or spiny armature. But in all main features the caterpillar  retains throughout its life the characteristic form in which it left  the egg. From the tiny, newly-hatched larva to the full-fed caterpillar,  possibly several inches in length, there is all along the same crawling,  somewhat worm-like body, destitute of any outward trace of wings. When  however the last larval cuticle has split open lengthwise along the  back, and has been worked off by vigorous wriggling motions of the  insect, the pupa thus revealed shows the wing-rudiments conspicuous at  the sides of the body, and lying neatly alongside these are to be seen  the forms of feelers, legs, and maxillae of the imago prefigured in the  cuticle of the pupa (fig. 1 _e_). The pupa thus resembles the imago much  more closely than it resembles the larva; even in the proportions of the  body a relative shortening is to be noticed, and the imago of any insect  with complete transformation is reduced in length as compared with the  full-fed larva. Now these wings and other structures characteristic of  the imago, appear in the pupa which is revealed by the shedding of the  last larval cuticle. From these facts we infer that the wing-rudiments  must be present in the larva, hidden beneath the cuticle; and until the  last larval instar, not beneath the cuticle only, but growing in  such-wise that they are hidden by the epidermis. For if they were  growing outwardly the new cuticle would be formed over them, so that  they would be apparent after the next moult. But it is clear that only  in the pupa, forming beneath the cuticle of the last larval instar, can  they grow outwards.    Anatomical study of the caterpillar at various stages verifies the  conclusions just drawn from superficial observation. A hundred and fifty  years ago P. Lyonet in his monumental work (1762) on the caterpillar of  the Goat Moth (Cossus) detected, in the second and third thoracic  segments, four little white masses buried in the fat-body, and, while  doubtful as to their real meaning, he suggested that their number and  position might well give rise to the suspicion that they were rudiments  of the wings of the moth. But it was a century later that A. Weismann in  his classical studies (1864) on the development of common flies, showed  the presence in the maggot of definite rudiments of wings, and other  organs of the adult--rudiments to which he gave the name of _imaginal  discs_."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1642"],[0,"Euthyphro (#5)"],[1,"understanding me. What I mean I may explain by an  illustration of what I do not mean. The poet (Stasinus) sings--    'Of Zeus, the author and creator of all these things, You will not tell:  for where there is fear there is also reverence.'    Now I disagree with this poet. Shall I tell you in what respect?    EUTHYPHRO: By all means.    SOCRATES: I should not say that where there is fear there is also  reverence; for I am sure that many persons fear poverty and disease, and  the like evils, but I do not perceive that they reverence the objects of  their fear.    EUTHYPHRO: Very true.    SOCRATES: But where reverence is, there is fear; for he who has a  feeling of reverence and shame about the commission of any action, fears  and is afraid of an ill reputation.    EUTHYPHRO: No doubt.    SOCRATES: Then we are wrong in saying that where there is fear there  is also reverence; and we should say, where there is reverence there is  also fear. But there is not always reverence where there is fear; for  fear is a more extended notion, and reverence is a part of fear, just as  the odd is a part of number, and number is a more extended notion than  the odd. I suppose that you follow me now?    EUTHYPHRO: Quite well.    SOCRATES: That was the sort of question which I meant to raise when  I asked whether the just is always the pious, or the pious always the  just; and whether there may not be justice where there is not piety; for  justice is the more extended notion of which piety is only a part. Do  you dissent?    EUTHYPHRO: No, I think that you are quite right.    SOCRATES: Then, if piety is a part of justice, I suppose that we should  enquire what part? If you had pursued the enquiry in the previous cases;  for instance, if you had asked me what is an even number, and what part  of number the even is, I should have had no difficulty in replying,  a number which represents a figure having two equal sides. Do you not  agree?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, I quite agree.    SOCRATES: In like manner, I want you to tell me what part of justice  is piety or holiness, that I may be able to tell Meletus not to do me  injustice, or indict me for impiety, as I am now adequately instructed  by you in the nature of piety or holiness, and their opposites.    EUTHYPHRO: Piety or holiness, Socrates, appears to me to be that part of  justice which attends to the gods, as there is the other part of justice  which attends to men.    SOCRATES: That is good, Euthyphro; yet still there is a little point  about which I should like to have further information, What is the  meaning of 'attention'? For attention can hardly be used in the same  sense when applied to the gods as when applied to other things. For  instance, horses are said to require attention, and not every person is  able to attend to them, but only a person skilled in horsemanship. Is it  not so?    EUTHYPHRO: Certainly.    SOCRATES: I should suppose that the art of horsemanship is the art of  attending to horses?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: Nor is every one qualified to attend to dogs, but only the  huntsman?    EUTHYPHRO: True.    SOCRATES: And I should also conceive that the art of the huntsman is the  art of attending to dogs?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: As the art of the oxherd is the art of attending to oxen?    EUTHYPHRO: Very true.    SOCRATES: In like manner holiness or piety is the art of attending to  the gods?--that would be your meaning, Euthyphro?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: And is not attention always designed for the good or benefit  of that to which the attention is given? As in the case of horses,  you may observe that when attended to by the horseman's art they are  benefited and improved, are they not?    EUTHYPHRO: True.    SOCRATES: As the dogs are benefited by the huntsman's art, and the oxen  by the art of the oxherd, and all other things are tended or attended  for their good and not for their hurt?    EUTHYPHRO: Certainly, not for their hurt.    SOCRATES: But for their good?    EUTHYPHRO: Of course.    SOCRATES: And does piety or holiness, which has been defined to be the  art of attending to the gods, benefit or improve them? Would you say  that when you do a holy act you make any of the gods better?    EUTHYPHRO: No, no; that was certainly not what I meant.    SOCRATES: And I, Euthyphro, never supposed that you did. I asked you the  question about the nature of the attention, because I thought that you  did not.    EUTHYPHRO: You do me justice, Socrates; that is not the sort of  attention which I mean.    SOCRATES: Good: but I must still ask what is this attention to the gods  which is called piety?    EUTHYPHRO: It is such, Socrates, as servants show to their masters.    SOCRATES: I understand--a sort of ministration to the gods.    EUTHYPHRO: Exactly.    SOCRATES: Medicine is also a sort of ministration or service, having in  view the attainment of some object--would you not say of health?    EUTHYPHRO: I should.    SOCRATES: Again, there is an art which ministers to the ship-builder  with a view to the attainment of some result?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates, with a view to the building of a ship.    SOCRATES: As there is an art which ministers to the house-builder with a  view to the building of a house?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: And now tell me, my good friend, about the art which ministers  to the gods: what work does that help to accomplish? For you must surely  know if, as you say, you are of all men living the one who is best  instructed in religion.    EUTHYPHRO: And I speak the truth, Socrates.    SOCRATES: Tell me then, oh tell me--what is that fair work which the  gods do by the help of our ministrations?    EUTHYPHRO: Many and fair, Socrates, are the works which they do.    SOCRATES: Why, my friend, and so are those of a general. But the chief  of them is easily told. Would you not say that victory in war is the  chief of them?    EUTHYPHRO: Certainly.    SOCRATES: Many and fair, too, are the works of the husbandman, if I  am not mistaken; but his chief work is the production of food from the  earth?    EUTHYPHRO: Exactly.    SOCRATES: And of the many and fair things done by the gods, which is the  chief or principal one?    EUTHYPHRO: I have told you already, Socrates, that to learn all these  things accurately will be very tiresome. Let me simply say that piety or  holiness is learning how to please the gods in word and deed, by prayers  and sacrifices. Such piety is the salvation of families and states,  just as the impious, which is unpleasing to the gods, is their ruin and  destruction.    SOCRATES: I think that you could have answered in much fewer words the  chief question which I asked, Euthyphro, if you had chosen. But I see  plainly that you are not disposed to instruct me--clearly not: else why,  when we reached the point, did you turn aside? Had you only answered  me I should have truly learned of you by this time the nature of  piety. Now, as the asker of a question is necessarily dependent on the  answerer, whither he leads I must follow; and can only ask again, what  is the pious, and what is piety? Do you mean that they are a sort of  science of praying and sacrificing?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, I do.    SOCRATES: And sacrificing is giving to the gods, and prayer is asking of  the gods?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates.    SOCRATES: Upon this view, then, piety is a science of asking and giving?    EUTHYPHRO: You understand me capitally, Socrates.    SOCRATES: Yes, my friend; the reason is that I am a votary of your  science, and give my mind to it, and therefore nothing which you say  will be thrown away upon me. Please then to tell me, what is the nature  of this service to the gods? Do you mean that we prefer requests and  give gifts to them?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, I do.    SOCRATES: Is not the right way of asking to ask of them what we want?    EUTHYPHRO: Certainly.    SOCRATES: And the right way of giving is to give to them in return what  they want of us. There would be no meaning in an art which gives to any  one that which he does not want.    EUTHYPHRO: Very true, Socrates.    SOCRATES: Then piety, Euthyphro, is an art which gods and men have of  doing business with one another?    EUTHYPHRO: That is an expression which you may use, if you like.    SOCRATES: But I have no particular liking for anything but the truth. I  wish, however, that you would tell me what benefit accrues to the gods  from our gifts. There is no doubt about what they give to us; for there  is no good thing which they do not give; but how we can give any good  thing to them in return is far from being equally clear. If they give  everything and we give nothing, that must be an affair of business in  which we have very greatly the advantage of them.    EUTHYPHRO: And do you imagine, Socrates, that any benefit accrues to the  gods from our gifts?    SOCRATES: But if not, Euthyphro, what is the meaning of gifts which are  conferred by us upon the gods?    EUTHYPHRO: What else, but tributes of honour; and, as I was just now  saying, what pleases them?    SOCRATES: Piety, then, is pleasing to the gods, but not beneficial or  dear to them?    EUTHYPHRO: I should say that nothing could be dearer.    SOCRATES: Then once more the assertion is repeated that piety is dear to  the gods?    EUTHYPHRO: Certainly.    SOCRATES: And when you say this, can you wonder at your words not  standing firm, but walking away? Will you accuse me of being the  Daedalus who makes them walk away, not perceiving that there is another  and far greater artist than Daedalus who makes them go round in a  circle, and he is yourself; for the argument, as you will perceive,  comes round to the same point. Were we not saying that the holy or  pious was not the same with that which is loved of the gods? Have you  forgotten?    EUTHYPHRO: I quite remember.    SOCRATES: And are you not saying that what is loved of the gods is holy;  and is not this the same as what is dear to them--do"]]]
