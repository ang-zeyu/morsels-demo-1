The vulgar continu'd under great Doubts and  Difficulties, in what would be his Case, and whether the _Old Warrant_,  or a _New One_ must be made for his Execution, or a New Tryal, _&c._  were the great Questions as arose, and occasion'd various Reasonings and  Speculation, till a News Paper, call'd the _Daily Journal_ set them all  to Rights by the Publication of the Account following, _viz._           '_J. Sheppard_ having been Convicted of Burglary, and Felony,       and received Sentence of Death, and afterwards 'Escap'd from       _Newgate_; and being since Re-taken'; we are assur'd that it       must be prov'd in a _Regular_, and _Judicial_ way, that he is       the same Person, who was so Convicted and made his Escape,       before a Warrant can be obtain'd for his Execution; and that       this Affair well be brought before the Court at the _Old       Baily_ the next Sessions.'    This was enough; People began to grow calm and easy and got _Shav'd_,  and their Shoes _finish'd_, and Business returned into its former  Channel, the Town resolving to wait the _Sessions_ with Patience.    The Reverend Mr. _Wagstaff_, who officiated in the absence of the  _Ordinary_, renew'd his former Acquaintance with Mr. _Sheppard_, and  examin'd him in a particular manner concerning his Escape from the  Condemn'd Hold: He sincerely disown'd, that all, or any, belonging to  the Prison were privy thereto; but related it as it has been describ'd.  He declar'd that _Edgworth Bess_, who had hitherto pass'd for his  _Wife_, was not really so: This was by some thought to be in him Base,  and Ungenerous in that, as she had Contributed towards his Escape, and  was in Custody on that Account, it might render her more liable to  Punishment, than if she had been thought his Wife; but he endeavour'd to  acquit himself, by saying, that she was the sole Author of all his  Misfortunes; That she betray'd him to _Jonathan Wild_, at the time he  was taken in _Rosemary-Lane_; and that when he was contriving his  Escape, she disobey'd his orders, as when being requir'd to attend at  the Door of the Condemn'd-Hold by Nine, or Ten in the Morning to  facilitate his Endeavours, she came not till the Evening, which he said,  was an ungrateful Return for the care he had taken in setting her at  Liberty from _New-Prison_; and thus Justify'd himself in what he had  done, and said he car'd not what became of her.    He was also Examined about Mr. _Martin's_ Watches; and whether _Page_  was privy to that Robbery; he carefully guarded himself against uttering  any thing that might affect him, peremptorily declar'd him Innocent of  that, as well as of being privy to his Escape, and said, that he only  out of Kindness, as being an old Companion, was resolv'd to share in his  Fortunes after he had Escap'd.    He was again continually meditating a second Escape, as appear'd by his  own Hardiness, and the Instruments found upon him, on _Saturday_ the  12th, and _Wednesday_ the 16th of _September_, the first Time a small  File was found conceal'd in his Bible, and the second Time two Files, a  Chisel and an Hammer being hid in the Rushes of a Chair; and whenever a  Question was mov'd to him, when, or by what Means those Implements came  to his Hands; he would passionately fly out, and say, _How can you? you  always ask me these, and such like Questions_; and in a particular  manner, when he was ask'd, Whether his Companion _Page_ was an  Accomplice with him, either in the affair of the Watches, or any other?  (he reply'd) _That if he knew, he would give no direct Answer_, thinking  it to be a Crime in him to detect the Guilty.    It was thought necessary by the Keepers to remove him from the  Condemn'd-Hold to a Place, call'd the _Castle_, in the Body of the Goal,  and to Chain him down to two large Iron Staples in the Floor; the  Concourse of People of tolerable Fashion to see him was exceeding Great,  he was always Chearful and Pleasant to a Degree, as turning almost every  thing as was said into a Jest and Banter.    Being one _Sunday_ at the Chapel, a Gentleman belonging to the _Lord  Mayor_, ask'd a Turnkey, Which was _Sheppard_, the Man pointed to him?  Says _Sheppard, yes Sir, I am the_ Sheppard_, and all the Goalers in the  Town are my Flock, and I cannot stir into the Country, but they are all  at my Heels_ Baughing, _after me, &c._    He told Mr. _Robins_, the _City Smith_, _That he had procur'd him a_  _small Job, and that whoever it was that put the Spikes on the  Condemn'd-Hold was an honest Man, for a better peice of Metal,_ says he,  _I never wrought upon in my Life._    He was loth to believe his frequent Robberies were an Injury to the  Public, for he us'd to say, That _if they were ill in one Respect, they  were as good in another, and that though he car'd not for Working much  himself, yet he was desirous that others should not stand Idle, more  especially those of his own Trade, who were always Repairing of his  Breaches._    When serious, and that but seldom, he would Reflect on his past wicked  Life. He declar'd to us, that for several Years of his Apprenticeship he  had an utter abhorrence to Women of the Town, and us'd to pelt them with  Dirt when they have fell in his way; till a _Button-Mould-Maker_ his  next Neighbour left off that Business, and set up a Victualling-house in  _Lewkenhors-Lane_, where himself and other young Apprentices resorted on  _Sundays_, and at all other Opportunities. At this House began his  Acquaintance with _Edgworth Bess_. His sentiments were strangely  alter'd, and from an Aversion to those Prostitutes, he had a more  favourable Opinion, and even Conversation with them, till he Contracted  an ill Distemper, which as he said, he cur'd himself of by a Medicine of  his own preparing.    He inveigh'd bitterly against his Brother _Thomas_ for putting him into  the Information, for Mrs. _Cook's_ Robberry, and pretended that all the  Mischiefs that attended him was owing to that Matter. He acknowledg'd  that he was concern'd in that Fact, and that his said Brother broke into  his Lodgings, and stole from him all his Share and more of the acquir'd  Booty.    He often-times averr'd, that _William Field_ was no ways concern'd in  Mr. _Kneebone's_ Robbery; but that being a Brother of the Quill;  _Blewskin_ and himself told him the particulars, and manner of the  Facts, and that all he Swore against him at his Tryal was False, and  that he had other Authority for it, than what came out of their  (_Sheppard_ and _Blewskin_) Mouths, who actually committed the Fact.    And moreover, that _Field_ being acquainted with their Warehouse (a  Stable) near the _Horse-Ferry_ at _Westminster_, which _Sheppard_ had  hir'd, and usually resposited therein the Goods he stole. He came one  Night, and broke open the same, and carried off the best part of the  Effects taken out of Mr. _Kneebone's_ Shop.    _Sheppard_ said he thought this to be one of the greatest Villanies that  could be acted, for another to come and Plunder them of Things for which  they had so honourably ventur'd their Lives, and wish'd that _Field_, as  well as his Brother _Tom_ might meet with forgiveness for it.    He declar'd himself frequently against the Practice of _Whidling_, or  _Impeaching_, which he said, had made dreadful Havock among the  _Thieves_, and much lamented the depravity of the _Brethren_ in that  Respect; and said that if all were but such _Tight-Cocks_ as himself,  the _Reputation_ of the _British Thievery_ might be carried to a far  greater height than it had been done for many Ages, and that there would  then be but little Necessity for Jaylors and Hangmen.    These and such like were his constant Discourses, when Company went up  with the Turnkeys to the _Castle_ to see him, and few or none went away  without leaving him Money for his Support; in which he abounded, and did  therewith some small Charities to the other Prisoners; however, he was  abstemious and sparing enough in his Diet.    Among the many Schemes laid by his Friends, for the preserving himself  after his Escape, we were told of a most Remarkable one, propos'd by an  ingenious Person, who advis'd, that he might be Expeditiously, and  Secretly convey'd to the Palace at _Windsor_, and there to prostrate his  Person, and his Case at the Feet of a most Gracious Prince, and his Case  being so very singular and new, it might in great probability move the  Royal Fountain of unbounded Clemency; but he declin'd this Advice, and  follow'd the Judgment and Dictates of _Butchers_, which very speedily  brought him very near the Door of the _Slaughterhouse_.    On the 4th of _September_, the Day as _Joseph Ward_, and _Anthony Upton_  were Executed, there was publish'd a whimsical Letter, as from  _Sheppard_, to _Jack Ketch_, which afforded Diversion to the Town, and  Bread to the Author, which is as followeth, _viz._           _SIR_,         I Thank you for the Favour you intended me this day: I am a       Gentleman, and allow you to be the same, and I hope can       forgive Injuries; fond Nature prompted, I obey'd, Oh,       propitious Minute! and to show that I am in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14070"],[0,"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures (#5)"],[1,"similar; but in no instance have they reduced them to what the author  considers a _regular systematic order_.    The methods which they have generally suggested, require the teacher to  _interrogate_ the pupil as he proceeds; or else he is permitted to parse  without giving any explanations at all. Others hint that the learner  ought to apply definitions in a general way, but they lay down no  systematic arrangement of questions as his guide. The _systematic_ order  laid down in this work, if pursued by the pupil, compels him to apply  every definition and every rule that appertains to each word he parses,  without having a question put to him by the teacher; and, in so doing,  he explains every word fully as he goes along. This course enables the  learner to proceed independently; and proves, at the same time, a great  relief to the instructer. The convenience and advantage of this method,  are far greater than can be easily conceived by one who is unacquainted  with it. The author is, therefore, anxious to have the absurd practice,  wherever it has been established, of causing learners to commit and  recite definitions and rules without any simultaneous application of  them to practical examples, immediately abolished. This system obviates  the necessity of pursuing such a stupid course of drudgery; for the  young beginner who pursues it, will have, in a few weeks, all the most  important definitions and rules perfectly committed, simply by applying  them in parsing.    If this plan be once adopted, it is confidently believed that every  teacher who is desirous to consult, either his own convenience, or the  advantage of his pupils, will readily pursue it in preference to any  former method. This belief is founded on the advantages which the  author himself has experienced from it in the course of several years,  devoted to the instruction of youth and adults. By pursuing this system,  he can, with less labor, advance a pupil farther in a practical  knowledge of this abstruse science, in _two months_, than he could in  _one year_ when he taught in the \"old way.\" It is presumed that no  instructor, who once gives this system a fair trial, will doubt the  truth of this assertion.    Perhaps some will, on a first view of the work, disapprove of the  transposition of many parts; but whoever examines it attentively, will  find that, although the author has not followed the common \"artificial  and unnatural arrangement adopted by most of his predecessors,\" yet he  has endeavored to pursue a more judicious one, namely, \"the order of the  understanding.\"    The learner should commence, _not by committing and rehearsing_, but by  reading attentively the first _two_ lectures several times over. He  ought then to parse, according to the _systematic order_, the examples  given for that purpose; in doing which, as previously stated, he has an  opportunity of committing all the definitions and rules belonging to the  parts of speech included in the examples.    The COMPENDIUM, as it presents to the eye of the learner a condensed but  comprehensive view of the whole science, may be properly considered an  \"Ocular Analysis of the English language.\" By referring to it, the young  student is enabled to apply all his definitions and rules from the very  commencement of his parsing. To some, this mode of procedure may seem  rather tedious; but it must appear obvious to every person of  discernment, that a pupil will learn more by parsing _five_ words  critically, and explaining them fully, than he would by parsing _fifty_  words superficially, and without understanding their various properties.  The teacher who pursues this plan, is not under the necessity of hearing  his pupils recite a single lesson of _definitions_ committed to memory,  for he has a fair opportunity of discovering their knowledge of these as  they evince it in parsing. All other directions necessary for the  learner in school, as well as for the _private learner_, will be given  in the succeeding pages of the work. Should these feeble efforts prove a  saving of much time and expense to those young persons who may be  disposed to pursue this science with avidity, by enabling them easily to  acquire a critical knowledge of a branch of education so important and  desirable, the author's fondest anticipations will be fully realized;  but should his work fall into the hands of any who are expecting, by the  acquisition, to become grammarians, and yet, have not sufficient  ambition and perseverance to make themselves acquainted with its  contents, it is hoped that the blame for their nonimprovement, will not  be thrown upon _him._           *       *       *       *       *    To those enterprising and intelligent gentlemen who may be disposed to  lecture on this plan, the author takes the liberty to offer a few hints  by way of encouragement.    Any judicious instructor of grammar, if he take the trouble to make  himself familiar with the contents of the following pages, will find it  an easy matter to pursue this system. One remark only to the lecturer,  is sufficient. Instead of causing his pupils to acquire a knowledge of  the nature and use of the principles by intense application, let him  communicate it verbally; that is, let him first take up one part of  speech, and, in an oral lecture, unfold and explain all its properties,  not only by adopting the illustrations given in the book, but also by  giving others that may occur to his mind as he proceeds. After a part of  speech has been thus elucidated, the class should be interrogated on it,  and then taught to parse it, and correct errors in composition under the  rules that apply to it. In the same manner he may proceed with the other  parts of speech, observing, however, to recapitulate occasionally, until  the learners become thoroughly acquainted with whatever principles may  have been presented. If this plan be faithfully pursued, rapid progress,  on the part of the learner, will be the inevitable result; and that  teacher who pursues it, cannot fail of acquiring distinction, and an  enviable popularity in his profession. S. KIRKHAM.          FAMILIAR LECTURES    ON    ENGLISH GRAMMAR.           *       *       *       *       *    LECTURE I      DIVISIONS OF GRAMMAR.--ORTHOGRAPHY.    TO THE YOUNG LEARNER.    You are about to enter upon one of the most useful, and, when rightly  pursued, one of the most interesting studies in the whole circle of  science. If, however, you, like many a misguided youth, are under the  impression that the study of grammar is dry and irksome, and a matter of  little consequence, I trust I shall succeed in removing from your mind,  all such false notions and ungrounded prejudices; for I will endeavor to  convince you, before I close these lectures, that this is not only a  pleasing study, but one of real and substantial utility; a study that  directly tends to adorn and dignify human nature, and meliorate the  condition of man. Grammar is a leading branch of that learning which  alone is capable of unfolding and maturing the mental powers, and of  elevating man to his proper rank in the scale of intellectual  existence;--of that learning which lifts the soul from earth, and  enables it to hold converse with a thousand worlds. In pursuing any and  every other path of science, you will discover the truth of these  remarks, and feel its force; for you will find, that, as grammar opens  the door to every department of learning, a knowledge of it is  indispensable: and should you not aspire at distinction in the republic  of letters, this knowledge cannot fail of being serviceable to you, even  if you are destined to pass through the humblest walks of life. I think  it is clear, that, in one point of view, grammatical knowledge possesses  a decisive advantage over every other branch of learning. Penmanship,  arithmetic, geography, astronomy, botany, chemistry, and so on, are  highly useful in their respective places; but not one of them is so  universally applicable to practical purposes, as this. In every  situation, under all circumstances, on all occasions;--when you speak,  read, write, or think, a knowledge of grammar is of essential utility.    Doubtless you have heard some persons assert, that they could detect and  correct any error in language by the ear, and speak and write accurately  without a knowledge of grammar. Now your own observation will soon  convince you, that this assertion is incorrect. A man of refined taste,  may, by perusing good authors, and conversing with the learned, acquire  that knowledge of language which will enable him to avoid those glaring  errors that offend the ear; but there are other errors equally gross,  which have not a harsh sound, and, consequently, which cannot be  detected without a knowledge of the rules that are violated. Believe me,  therefore, when I say, that without the knowledge and application of  grammar rules, it is impossible for any one to think, speak, read, or  write with accuracy. From a want of such knowledge, many often express  their ideas in a manner so improper and obscure as to render it  impossible for any one to _understand_ them: their language frequently  amounts, not only to _bad_ sense, but _non_-sense. In other instances  several different meanings may be affixed to the words they employ; and  what is still worse, is, that not unfrequently their sentences are so  constructed, as to convey a meaning quite the reverse of that which they  intended. Nothing of a secular nature can be more worthy of your  attention, then, than the acquisition of grammatical knowledge.    The path which leads to grammatical excellence, is not all the way  smooth and flowery, but in it you will find some thorns interspersed,  and some obstacles to be surmounted; or, in simple language, you will  find, in the pursuit of this science, many intricacies which it is  rather difficult for the juvenile mind completely to unravel."]]]
