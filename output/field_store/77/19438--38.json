As in France politics, so in  England manufacture, and the movement of civil society in general drew  into the whirl of history the last classes which had remained sunk in  apathetic indifference to the universal interests of mankind.    The first invention which gave rise to a radical change in the state of  the English workers was the jenny, invented in the year 1764 by a weaver,  James Hargreaves, of Standhill, near Blackburn, in North Lancashire.  This  machine was the rough beginning of the later invented mule, and was moved  by hand.  Instead of one spindle like the ordinary spinning-wheel, it  carried sixteen or eighteen manipulated by a single workman.  This  invention made it possible to deliver more yarn than heretofore.  Whereas,  though one weaver had employed three spinners, there had never been  enough yarn, and the weaver had often been obliged to wait for it, there  was now more yarn to be had than could be woven by the available workers.  The demand for woven goods, already increasing, rose yet more in  consequence of the cheapness of these goods, which cheapness, in turn,  was the outcome of the diminished cost of producing the yarn.  More  weavers were needed, and weavers' wages rose.  Now that the weaver could  earn more at his loom, he gradually abandoned his farming, and gave his  whole time to weaving.  At that time a family of four grown persons and  two children (who were set to spooling) could earn, with eight hours'  daily work, four pounds sterling in a week, and often more if trade was  good and work pressed.  It happened often enough that a single weaver  earned two pounds a week at his loom.  By degrees the class of farming  weavers wholly disappeared, and was merged in the newly arising class of  weavers who lived wholly upon wages, had no property whatever, not even  the pretended property of a holding, and so became working-men,  proletarians.  Moreover, the old relation between spinner and weaver was  destroyed.  Hitherto, so far as this had been possible, yarn had been  spun and woven under one roof.  Now that the jenny as well as the loom  required a strong hand, men began to spin, and whole families lived by  spinning, while others laid the antiquated, superseded spinning-wheel  aside; and, if they had not means of purchasing a jenny, were forced to  live upon the wages of the father alone.  Thus began with spinning and  weaving that division of labour which has since been so infinitely  perfected.    While the industrial proletariat was thus developing with the first still  very imperfect machine, the same machine gave rise to the agricultural  proletariat.  There had, hitherto, been a vast number of small  landowners, yeomen, who had vegetated in the same unthinking quiet as  their neighbours, the farming weavers.  They cultivated their scraps of  land quite after the ancient and inefficient fashion of their ancestors,  and opposed every change with the obstinacy peculiar to such creatures of  habit, after remaining stationary from generation to generation.  Among  them were many small holders also, not tenants in the present sense of  the word, but people who had their land handed down from their fathers,  either by hereditary lease, or by force of ancient custom, and had  hitherto held it as securely as if it had actually been their own  property.  When the industrial workers withdrew from agriculture, a great  number of small holdings fell idle, and upon these the new class of large  tenants established themselves, tenants-at-will, holding fifty, one  hundred, two hundred or more acres, liable to be turned out at the end of  the year, but able by improved tillage and larger farming to increase the  yield of the land.  They could sell their produce more cheaply than the  yeomen, for whom nothing remained when his farm no longer supported him  but to sell it, procure a jenny or a loom, or take service as an  agricultural labourer in the employ of a large farmer.  His inherited  slowness and the inefficient methods of cultivation bequeathed by his  ancestors, and above which he could not rise, left him no alternative  when forced to compete with men who managed their holdings on sounder  principles and with all the advantages bestowed by farming on a large  scale and the investment of capital for the improvement of the soil.    Meanwhile, the industrial movement did not stop here.  Single capitalists  began to set up spinning jennies in great buildings and to use  water-power for driving them, so placing themselves in a position to  diminish the number of workers, and sell their yarn more cheaply than  single spinners could do who moved their own machines by hand.  There  were constant improvements in the jenny, so that machines continually  became antiquated, and must be altered or even laid aside; and though the  capitalists could hold out by the application of water-power even with  the old machinery, for the single spinner this was impossible.  And the  factory system, the beginning of which was thus made, received a fresh  extension in 1767, through the spinning throstle invented by Richard  Arkwright, a barber, in Preston, in North Lancashire.  After the steam-  engine, this is the most important mechanical invention of the 18th  century.  It was calculated from the beginning for mechanical motive  power, and was based upon wholly new principles.  By the combination of  the peculiarities of the jenny and throstle, Samuel Crompton, of Firwood,  Lancashire, contrived the mule in 1785, and as Arkwright invented the  carding engine, and preparatory (\"slubbing and roving\") frames about the  same time, the factory system became the prevailing one for the spinning  of cotton.  By means of trifling modifications these machines were  gradually adapted to the spinning of flax, and so to the superseding of  hand-work here, too.  But even then, the end was not yet.  In the closing  years of the last century, Dr. Cartwright, a country parson, had invented  the power-loom, and about 1804 had so far perfected it, that it could  successfully compete with the hand-weaver; and all this machinery was  made doubly important by James Watt's steam-engine, invented in 1764, and  used for supplying motive power for spinning since 1785.    With these inventions, since improved from year to year, the victory of  machine-work over hand-work in the chief branches of English industry was  won; and the history of the latter from that time forward simply relates  how the hand-workers have been driven by machinery from one position  after another.  The consequences of this were, on the one hand, a rapid  fall in price of all manufactured commodities, prosperity of commerce and  manufacture, the conquest of nearly all the unprotected foreign markets,  the sudden multiplication of capital and national wealth; on the other  hand, a still more rapid multiplication of the proletariat, the  destruction of all property-holding and of all security of employment for  the working-class, demoralisation, political excitement, and all those  facts so highly repugnant to Englishmen in comfortable circumstances,  which we shall have to consider in the following pages.  Having already  seen what a transformation in the social condition of the lower classes a  single such clumsy machine as the jenny had wrought, there is no cause  for surprise as to that which a complete and interdependent system of  finely adjusted machinery has brought about, machinery which receives raw  material and turns out woven goods.    Meanwhile, let us trace the development of English manufacture {7}  somewhat more minutely, beginning with the cotton industry.  In the years  1771-1775, there were annually imported into England rather less than  5,000,000 pounds of raw cotton; in the year 1841 there were imported  528,000,000 pounds, and the import for 1844 will reach at least  600,000,000 pounds.  In 1834 England exported 556,000,000 yards of woven  cotton goods, 76,500,000 pounds of cotton yarn, and cotton hosiery of the  value of 1,200,000 pounds.  In the same year over 8,000,000 mule spindles  were at work, 110,000 power and 250,000 hand-looms, throstle spindles not  included, in the service of the cotton industry; and, according to  MacCulloch's reckoning, nearly a million and a half human beings were  supported by this branch, of whom but 220,000 worked in the mills; the  power used in these mills was steam, equivalent to 33,000 horse-power,  and water, equivalent to 11,000 horse-power.  At present these figures  are far from adequate, and it may be safely assumed that, in the year  1845, the power and number of the machines and the number of the workers  is greater by one-half than it was in 1834.  The chief centre of this  industry is Lancashire, where it originated; it has thoroughly  revolutionised this county, converting it from an obscure, ill-cultivated  swamp into a busy, lively region, multiplying its population tenfold in  eighty years, and causing giant cities such as Liverpool and Manchester,  containing together 700,000 inhabitants, and their neighbouring towns,  Bolton with 60,000, Rochdale with 75,000, Oldham with 50,000, Preston  with 60,000, Ashton and Stalybridge with 40,000, and a whole list of  other manufacturing towns to spring up as if by a magic touch.  The  history of South Lancashire contains some of the greatest marvels of  modern times, yet no one ever mentions them, and all these miracles are  the product of the cotton industry.  Glasgow, too, the centre for the  cotton district of Scotland, for Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire, has  increased in population from 30,000 to 300,000 since the introduction of  the industry.  The hosiery manufacture of Nottingham and Derby also  received one fresh impulse from the lower price of yarn, and a second one  from an improvement of the stocking loom, by means of which two stockings  could be woven at once.

Thus hath it been decreed in a Written  Tablet. Such shall be the ascendancy which these souls will evince that  consternation and dismay will seize all the dwellers of the earth.    42 Beware lest ye shed the blood of anyone. Unsheathe the sword of your  tongue from the scabbard of utterance, for therewith ye can conquer the  citadels of men's hearts. We have abolished the law to wage holy war  against each other. God's mercy, hath, verily, encompassed all created  things, if ye do but understand. Aid ye your Lord, the God of Mercy, with  the sword of understanding. Keener indeed is it, and more finely tempered,  than the sword of utterance, were ye but to reflect upon the words of your  Lord. Thus have the hosts of Divine Revelation been sent down by God, the  Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and thus have the armies of divine  inspiration been made manifest from the Source of command, as bidden by  God, the All-Glorious, the Best-Beloved.    43 Say: The measure of all created things hath been appointed in this  concealed and manifest Temple, wherein lie enshrined the knowledge of the  heavens and the earth, and of all things past and future. The finger of  God's handiwork hath inscribed upon this Tablet that which the wisest and  most learned of men are powerless to fathom, and hath created therein  temples inscrutable to all save His own Self, could ye but apprehend this  truth. Blessed be the one who readeth it, who pondereth its contents, and  who is numbered with them that comprehend!    44 Say: Naught is seen in My temple but the Temple of God, and in My  beauty but His Beauty, and in My being but His Being, and in My self but  His Self, and in My movement but His Movement, and in My acquiescence but  His Acquiescence, and in My pen but His Pen, the Mighty, the All-Praised.  There hath not been in My soul but the Truth, and in Myself naught could  be seen but God.    45 Beware lest ye speak of duality in regard to My Self, for all the atoms  of the earth proclaim that there is none other God but Him, the One, the  Single, the Mighty, the Loving. From the beginning that hath no beginning  I have proclaimed, from the realm of eternity, that I am God, none other  God is there save Me, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting; and unto the  end that hath no end I shall proclaim, amidst the kingdom of names, that I  am God, none other God is there beside Me, the All-Glorious, the  Best-Beloved. Say: Lordship is My Name, whereof I have created  manifestations in the world of being, while We Ourself remain sanctified  above them, would ye but ponder this truth. And Godhead is My Name,  whereof We have created exponents whose power shall encompass the people  of the earth and make them true worshippers of God, could ye but recognize  it. Thus should ye regard all Our Names, if ye be endued with insight.    46 O Fourth Letter of this Temple, betokening the attribute of Grace! We  have made thee the manifestation of grace betwixt earth and heaven. From  thee have We generated all grace in the contingent world, and unto thee  shall We cause it to return. And from thee shall We manifest it again,  through a word of Our command. Potent am I to accomplish whatsoever I  desire through My word \"Be\", and it is! Every grace that appeareth in the  world of being hath originated from thee, and unto thee shall it return.  This, verily, is what hath been ordained in a Tablet which We have  preserved behind the veil of glory and concealed from mortal eyes. Well is  it with them that deprive themselves not of this manifest and unfailing  grace.    47 Say: In this day, the fertilizing winds of the grace of God have passed  over all things. Every creature hath been endowed with all the  potentialities it can carry. And yet the peoples of the world have denied  this grace! Every tree hath been endowed with the choicest fruits, every  ocean enriched with the most luminous gems. Man, himself, hath been  invested with the gifts of understanding and knowledge. The whole creation  hath been made the recipient of the revelation of the All-Merciful, and  the earth the repository of things inscrutable to all except God, the  Truth, the Knower of things unseen. The time is approaching when every  created thing will have cast its burden. Glorified be God Who hath  vouchsafed this grace that encompasseth all things, whether seen or  unseen! Thus have We created the whole earth anew in this day, yet most of  the people have failed to perceive it. Say: The grace of God can never be  adequately understood; how much less can His own Self, the Help in Peril,  the Self-Subsisting, be comprehended!    48 O Temple of the Cause! Grieve not if Thou findest none ready to receive  Thy gifts. Thou wast created for My sake; occupy Thyself therefore with My  praise amidst My servants. This is that which hath been ordained for Thee  in the Preserved Tablet. Having found upon the earth many a soiled hand,  We sanctified the hem of Thy garment from the profanity of their touch and  placed it beyond the reach of the ungodly. Be patient in the Cause of Thy  Lord, for erelong shall He raise up souls endowed with sanctified hearts  and illumined eyes who shall flee from every quarter unto Thine  all-encompassing and boundless grace.    49 O Temple of God! No sooner had the hosts of Divine Revelation been sent  down by the Lord of all names and attributes bearing the banners of His  signs, than the exponents of doubt and fancy were put to flight. They  disbelieved in the clear tokens of God, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting, and rose up against Him in enmity and opposition. Amongst  them were those who claimed: \"These are not clear verses from God, nor do  they proceed from an innate and untaught nature.\" Thus do the unbelievers  seek to remedy the sickness of their hearts, utterly heedless that they  thus render themselves accursed of all who dwell in heaven and on earth.    50 Say: The Holy Spirit Itself hath been generated through the agency of a  single letter revealed by this Most Great Spirit, if ye be of them that  comprehend. And that innate and untaught nature in its essence is called  into being by the verses of God, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the  Best-Beloved. Say: This nature prideth itself in its relation to Our  transcendent Truth, whilst We, for Our part, glory neither in it nor in  aught else, for all beside Myself hath been created through the potency of  My word, could ye but understand.    51 Say: We have revealed Our verses in nine different modes. Each one of  them bespeaketh the sovereignty of God, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting. A single one of them sufficeth for a proof unto all who  are in the heavens and on the earth; yet the people, for the most part,  persist in their heedlessness. Should it be Our wish, We would reveal them  in countless other modes.    52 Say: O people! Fear ye God, and allow not your tongues to utter, in  their deceitfulness, that which displeaseth Him. Stand abashed before the  One Who, as ye well know, hath created you out of a drop of water.(5) Say:  We have created all that are in heaven and on earth in the nature made by  God. Whosoever turneth unto this blessed Countenance shall manifest the  potentialities of that inborn nature, and whosoever remaineth veiled  therefrom shall be deprived of this invisible and all-encompassing grace.  Verily, there is naught from which Our favour hath been withheld, inasmuch  as We have dealt equitably in the fashioning of each and all, and by a  word of Our mouth presented unto them the trust of Our love. They that  have accepted it are indeed safe and secure, and are numbered among those  who are immune from the terrors of this Day. Those, however, who have  rejected it have, in truth, disbelieved in God, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting. Thus do We distinguish between the people and pronounce  judgement upon them. We, of a certainty, have the power to discern.    53 Say: The Word of God can never be confounded with the words of His  creatures. It is, in truth, the King of words, even as He is Himself the  sovereign Lord of all, and His Cause transcendeth all that was and all  that shall be. Enter, O people, the City of Certitude wherein the throne  of your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath been established. Thus biddeth you  the Pen of the All-Glorious, as a token of His unfailing grace. Haply ye  may not make His Revelation a cause of dissension amongst you.    54 Among the infidels are those who have repudiated His Self and risen up  against His Cause, and who claim that these divine verses are contrived.  Such also were the objections of the deniers of old, who now implore  deliverance from the Fire. Say: Woe betide you for the idle words that  proceed from your mouths! If these verses be indeed contrived, then by  what proof have ye believed in God? Produce it, if ye be men of  understanding! Whensoever We revealed Our clear verses unto such men, they  rejected them, and whensoever they beheld that which the combined forces  of the earth are powerless to produce, they pronounced it sorcery.    55 What aileth this people that they speak of that which they understand  not? They raise the same objections as did the followers of the Qur'an  when their Lord came unto them with His Cause. They, verily, are a  rejected people. They hindered others from appearing before Him Who is the  Ancient Beauty, and from sharing the bread of His loved ones. \"Approach  them not,\" one was even heard to say, \"for they cast a spell upon the  people and lead them astray from the path of God, the Help in Peril, the "]]]
