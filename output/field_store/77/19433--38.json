Buddy rolled over twice and got up, a little dizzy and very indignant,  and shouted to father, \"Shoot a sunsyguns!\"    From that time Buddy added hatred to his distrust of Indians.    From the time when he was four until he was thirteen Buddy's life  contained enough thrills to keep a movie-mad boy of to-day sitting on  the edge of his seat gasping enviously through many a reel, but to Buddy  it was all rather humdrum and monotonous.    What he wanted to do was to get out and hunt buffalo. Just herding  horses, and watching out for Indians, and killing rattlesnakes was what  any boy in the country would be doing. Still, Buddy himself achieved now  and then a thrill.    There was one day, when he stood heedlessly on a ridge looking for a  dozen head of lost horses in the draws below. It was all very well to  explain missing horses by the conjecture that the Injuns must have got  them, but Buddy happened to miss old Rattler with the others. Rattler  had come north with the trail herd, and he was wise beyond the wisdom of  most horses. He would drive cattle out of the brush without a rider to  guide him, if only you put a saddle on him. He had helped Buddy to mount  his back--when Buddy was much smaller than now--by lowering his head  until Buddy straddled it, and then lifting it so that Buddy slid down  his neck and over his withers to his back. Even now Buddy sometimes  mounted that way when no one was looking. Many other lovable traits had  Rattler, and to lose him would be a tragedy to the family.    So Buddy was on the ridge, scanning all the deep little washes and  draws, when a bullet PING-G-GED over his head. Buddy caught the bridle  reins and pulled his horse into the shelter of rocks, untied his rifle  from the saddle and crept back to reconnoitre. It was the first time he  had ever been shot at--except in the army posts, when the Indians  had \"broken out\",--and the aim then was generally directed toward his  vicinity rather than his person.    An Indian on a horse presently appeared cautiously from cover, and  Buddy, trembling with excitement, shot wild; but not so wild that the  Indian could afford to scoff and ride closer. After another ineffectual  shot at Buddy, he whipped his horse down the ridge, and made for Bannock  creek.    Buddy at thirteen knew more of the wiles of Indians than does the  hardiest Indian fighter on the screen to-day. Father had warned him  never to chase an Indian into cover, where others would probably be  waiting for him. So he stayed where he was, pretty well hidden in the  rocks, and let the bullets he himself had \"run\" in father's bullet-mold  follow the enemy to the fringe of bushes. His last shot knocked the  Indian off his horse--or so it looked to Buddy. He waited for a long  time, watching the brush and thinking what a fool that Indian was to  imagine Buddy would follow him down there. After a while he saw the  Indian's horse climbing the slope across the creek. There was no rider.    Buddy rode home without the missing horses, and did not tell anyone  about the Indian, though his thoughts would not leave the subject.    He wondered what mother would think of it. Mother's interests seemed  mostly confined to teaching Buddy and Dulcie what they were deprived of  learning in schools, and to play the piano--a wonderful old square piano  that had come all the way from Scotland to the Tomahawk ranch, the very  frontier of the West.    Mother was a wonderful woman, with a soft voice and a slight Scotch  accent, and wit; and a knowledge of things which were little known in  the wilderness. Buddy never dreamed then how strangely culture was mixed  with pure savagery in his life. To him the secret regret that he had not  dared ride into the bushes to scalp the Indian he believed he had shot,  and the fact that his hands were straining at the full chords of  the ANVIL CHORUS on that very evening, was not even to be considered  unusual. Still, certain strains of that classic were always afterward  associated in his mind with the shooting of the Indian--if he had really  shot him.    While he counted the time with a conscientious regard for the rests, he  debated the wisdom of telling mother, and decided that perhaps he had  better keep that matter to himself, like a man.        CHAPTER FOUR: BUDDY GIVES WARNING    Buddy swung down from his horse, unsaddled it and went staggering to the  stable wall with the burden of a stock-saddle much too big for him. He  had to stand on his boot-toes to reach and pull the bridle down over the  ears of Whitefoot, which turned with an air of immense relief into the  corral gate and the hay piled at the further end. Buddy gave him  one preoccupied glance and started for the cabin, walking with the  cowpuncher's peculiar, bowlegged gait which comes of wearing chaps and  throwing out the knees to overcome the stiffness of the leather. At  thirteen Buddy was a cowboy from hat-crown to spurs-and at thirteen  Buddy gloried in the fact. To-day, however, his mind was weighted with  matters of more importance than himself.    \"The Utes are having a war-dance, mother,\" he announced when he had  closed the stout door of the kitchen behind him. \"They mean it this  time. I lay in the brush and watched them last night.\" He stood looking  at his mother speculatively, a little grin on his face. \"I told you, you  can't change an Injun by learning him to eat with a knife and fork,\" he  added. \"Colorou ain't any whiter than he was before you set out to learn  him manners. He was hoppin' higher than any of 'em.\"    \"Teach, Buddy, not learn. You know better than to say 'learn him  manners.'\"    \"Teach him manners,\" Buddy corrected himself obediently. \"I was thinking  more about what I saw than about grammar. Where's father? I guess I'd  better tell him. He'll want to get the stock out of the mountains, I  should think.\"    \"Colorou will send me word before they take the warpath,\" mother  observed reassuringly. \"He always has. I gave him a whole pound of tea  and a blue ribbon the last time he was here.\"    \"Yes, and the last time they broke out they got away with more 'n a  hundred head of cattle. You got to Laramie, all right, but he didn't  tell father in time to make a roundup back in the foothills. They're  DANCING, mother!\"    \"Well, I suppose We're due for an outbreak,\" sighed mother. \"Colorou  says he can't hold his young men off when some of the tribe have been  killed. He himself doesn't countenance the stealing and the occasional  killing of white men. There are bad Indians and good ones.\"    \"I know a couple of good ones,\" Buddy murmured as he made for the wash  basin. \"It's the bad ones that were doing the dancing, mother,\" he flung  over his shoulder. \"And if I was you I'd take Dulcie and the cats and  hit for Laramie. Colorou might get busy and forget to send word!\"    \"If I WAS you?\" Mother came up and nipped his ear between thumb and  finger. \"Robert, I am discouraged over you. All that I teach you in the  winter seems to evaporate from your mind during the summer when you go  out riding with the boys.\"    Buddy wiped his face with an up-and-down motion on the roller towel and  clanked across to the cupboard which he opened investigatively. \"Any  pie?\" he questioned as he peered into the corners. \"Say, if I had the  handling of those Utes, mother, I'd fix 'em so they wouldn't be breaking  out every few months and making folks leave their homes to be pawed over  and burnt, maybe.\" He found a jar of fresh doughnuts and took three.    \"They'll tromp around on your flower-beds--it just makes me SICK when  I think how they'll muss things up around here! I wish now,\" He blurted  unthinkingly, \"that I hadn't killed the Injun that stole Rattler.\"    \"Buddy! Not YOU.\" His mother made a swift little run across the kitchen  and caught him on his lean, hard-muscled young shoulders. \"You--you  baby! What did you do? You didn't harm an Indian, did you, laddie?\"    Buddy tilted his head downward so that she could not look into his eyes.  \"I dunno as I harmed him--much,\" he said, wiping doughnut crumbs from  his mouth with one hasty sweep of his forearm. \"But his horse came  outa the brush, and he never. I guess I killed him, all right. Anyway,  mother, I had to. He took a shot at me first. It was the day we lost  Rattler and the bronks,\" He added accurately.    Mother did not say anything for a minute, and Buddy hung his head lower,  dreading to see the hurt look which he felt was in her eyes.    \"I have to pack a gun when I ride anywhere,\" he reminded her  defensively. \"It ain't to balance me on the horse, either. If Injuns  take in after me, the gun's so I can shoot. And a feller don't shoot  up in the air--and if an Injun is hunting trouble he oughta expect that  maybe he might get shot sometime. You--you wouldn't want me to just run  and let them catch me, would you?\"    Mother's hand slipped up to his head and pressed it against her breast  so that Buddy heard her heart beating steady and sweet and true. Mother  wasn't afraid--never, never!    \"I know--it's the dreadful necessity of defending our lives. But you're  so young--just mother's baby man!\"    Buddy looked up at her then, a laugh twinkling in his eyes. After all,  mother understood.    \"I'm going to be your baby man always if you want me to, mother,\" He  whispered, closing his arms around her neck in a sturdy hug. \"But I'm  father's horse-wrangler, too. And a horse-wrangler has got to hold  up his end. I--I didn't want to kill anybody, honest. But Injuns are  different. You kill rattlers, and they ain't as mean as Injuns. That one  I shot at was shooting at me before I even so much as knew there was one  around. I just shot back. Father would, or anybody else.\"    \"I know--I know,\" she conceded, the tender womanliness of her sighing  over the need. In the next moment she was all mother, ready to fight for  her young. \"Buddy, never, never ride"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],[0,"Added Upon (#5)"],[1," boy  of about fifteen, wearing a big straw hat pressed down over his brown  hair, a shabby coat, blue overalls with a rend up one leg, ragged shoes,  but no stockings. He was wet to the skin, and a pool of water soon  accumulated on the floor where he paused for an instant.    \"Rupert, you're wet through. How long you have been! You must get your  clothes off,\" anxiously exclaimed his mother.    \"Phew!\" said he, \"that's a whoopin' big rain. Say, mother, if we'd only  had this two months ago, now, on our dry farm, wouldn't we have raised a  crop though.\"    \"You must get your clothes off, Rupert.\"    \"Oh, that's nothin'. I must milk first; and say, I guess the mud's  washed off the roof by the looks of things. I guess I'll fix it.\"    \"Never mind now, you're so wet.\"    \"Well, I can't get any wetter, and I'll work and keep warm. It won't do  to have the water comin' in like this--look here, there's a mud puddle  right on Sis's back, an' she don't know it.\"    He laughed and went out. It was quite dark, but the rain had nearly  ceased. With his wheel-barrow and shovel he went to a ravine close by  and obtained a load of clay, which he easily threw up on the roof of the  low \"lean-to\"; then he climbed up and patched the holes. A half hour's  work and it was done.    \"And now I'll milk while I'm at it,\" he said; which he did.    \"I've kept your supper warm,\" said his mother, as she busied with the  table. \"It's turned quite cold. Why did you stay so long today?\"    Rupert had changed his wet clothes, and the family was sitting around  the table eating mush and milk. A small lamp threw a cheery light over  the bare table and its few dishes, over the faces of mother, boy, and  girl. It revealed the bed, moved back into its usual corner, shone on  the cupboard with its red paint nearly worn off, and dimly lighted the  few pictures hanging on the rough whitewashed wall.    It was a poor home, but the lamplight revealed no discontent in the  faces around the table. True, the mother's was a little pinched and  careworn, which gave the yet beautiful face a sharp expression; but the  other two countenances shone with health and happiness. The girl was  enjoying her supper, the bright sagebrush fire, and the story book by  the side of her bowl, all at the same time. She dipped, alternately,  into her bowl and into her book.    The boy was the man of that family. He had combed his hair well back,  and his bright, honest face gleamed in the light. He was big and strong,  hardened by constant toil, matured beyond his years by the  responsibility which had been placed upon him since his father's death,  now four years ago. In answer to his mother's inquiries, Rupert  explained:    \"You see, the cows had strayed up Dry Holler, an' I had an awful time a  findin' them. I couldn't hear any bell, neither. Dry Holler creek is  just boomin', an' there's a big lake up there now. The water has washed  out a hole in the bank and has gone into Dry Basin, an' it's backed up  there till now it's a lake as big as Brown's pond. As I stood and looked  at the running water an' the pond, somethin' came into my  head--somethin' I heard down town last summer. An' mother, _we_ must do  it!\"    The boy was glowing with some exciting thought. His mother looked at him  while his sister neglected both book and bowl.    \"Do what, Rupert?\"    \"Why, we must have Dry Basin, an' I'll make a reservoir out of it, an'  we'll have water in the summer for our land, an' it'll be just the  thing. With a little work the creek can be turned into the Basin  which'll fill up during the winter an' spring. There's a low place which  we'll have to bank up, an' the thing's done. The ditch'll be the biggest  job, but I think we can get some help on that--but we must have the land  up in Dry Holler now before someone else thinks of it an' settles on it.  Mother, I was just wonderin' why someone hasn't thought of this before.\"    The mother was taken by surprise. She sat and looked wonderingly at the  boy as he talked. The idea was new to her, but now she thought of it, it  seemed perfectly feasible. Work was the only thing needed; but could she  and her boy do it?    Five years ago when Mr. Ames had moved upon the bench, he had been  promised that the new canal should come high enough to bring water to  his land; but a new survey had been made which had left his farm far  above the irrigation limit. Mr. Ames had died before he could move his  family; and they had been compelled to remain in their temporary hut  these four long, hard years. Rupert had tried to farm without water. A  little wheat and alfalfa had been raised, which helped the little family  to live without actual suffering.           *       *       *       *       *    That evening, mother and son talked late into the night. Nina listened  until her eyes closed in sleep. The rain had ceased altogether, and the  moon, hurrying through the breaking clouds, shone in at the little  curtained window. Prayers were said, and then they retired. Peaceful  sleep reigned within. Without, the moonlight illumined the mountains,  shining on the caps of pearly whiteness which they had donned for the  night.          II.      \"He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread; but    he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.\"--_Prov. 12:11._      Widow Ames had homesteaded one hundred and sixty acres of government  land in Dry Hollow. That was a subject for a two days' gossip in the  town. There was speculation about what she wanted with a dry ravine in  the hills, and many shook their heads in condemnation. However, it set  some to thinking and moved one man, at least, to action. Jed Bolton,  the same day that he heard of it, rode up into the hills above town.  Sure enough, there was a rough shanty nearly finished; some furrows had  been plowed, and every indication of settlement was present. Mr. Bolton  bit his lip and used language which, if it did not grate on his own  ears, could not on the only other listener, his horse.    Rupert was on the roof of his shanty, and Mr. Bolton greeted him as he  rode up.    \"Hello, Rupe, what're ye doin'?\"    \"Just finishin' my house. It looks like more rain, an' I must have the  roof good an' tight.\"    \"You're not goin' to live here?\"    \"Oh, yes, part of the time.\"    \"What's that for?\"    \"To secure our claim. Mother's homesteaded one hundred and sixty acres  of this land.\"    \"What in the world are you goin' to do with it?\"    \"We'll farm some of it, of course, an' we'll find some use for another  part after awhile, I guess.\"    Then Mr. Bolton changed his tactics. He tried to discourage the boy by  telling him that it was railroad land, and even if it wasn't, his own  adjacent claim took it all in anyway; Rupert did not scare, but said, \"I  guess not,\" as he went on quietly fitting and pounding.    The man had to give it up. \"That Ames kid\" had gotten the best of him.    This was four years ago, and wonderful changes had taken place since  then. Rupert had begun work on his reservoir the spring after they had  taken possession. He had a most beautiful site for one; and when the  melting winter snows and spring rains filled Dry Hollow creek, most of  it was turned into the Basin. It slowly spread out, filled the deep  ravines, and crept up to Rupert's embankment. Then he turned the stream  back into its natural channel again. Many came to look at the wonder.  Some of his neighbor \"dry-benchers\" offered to join him and help him for  a share in the water. The reservoir could be greatly enlarged, and the  canal leading from it around the side-hills to the bench had yet to be  dug; so Rupert and his mother accepted the offers of help and the work  went on rapidly. The next year Dry Bench had water. New ground was  broken and cleared. Trees were set out. There was new life on the farm,  and new hopes within the hearts of Widow Ames and her children.    Dry Bench farm had undergone a change. A neat frame house stood in front  of the log hut, which had been boarded and painted to match the newer  part. A barn filled with hay and containing horses and cows stood at a  proper distance back. A granary and a corn-crib were near. The new  county road now extended along the fronting of the Ames place, and a  neat fence separated the garden from the public highway. On the left was  the orchard, a beautiful sight. Standing in long, symmetrical rows were  peaches, apples, pears, and a dozen other varieties of fruit, now just  beginning to bear. At the rear, stretching nearly to the mountains, were  the grain and alfalfa fields. Neighboring farms also were greatly  improved by the advent of water, but none showed such labor and care as  the Ames farm. Rupert grew with the growth of his labors, until he was  now a tall, muscular fellow, browned and calloused. Nina was fast  outgrowing childish things and entering the young-lady period. A  beautiful girl she was, and a favorite among her schoolmates. She had  attended school in town for the past three winters, and her brother was  talking of sending her to the high school.    Practically, Rupert was the head of the family. Always respectful to his  mother, and generally consulting with her on any important matter, he  nevertheless could not help seeing that everything depended on him, and  that he was the master mind of Ames farm. And then the neighbors came to  him for advice, and older and presumably wiser men counseled with him,  and so it suggested itself to Rupert that he was the master mind of all  Dry Bench besides. Everybody called him a \"rustler.\" When he had leisure  for school, he was beyond school age; so, nothing daunted, he set out to  study by himself. He procured the necessary books, and went to them with  an energy that made up for the lack of a teacher. Nina kept pace with  him for a time, but the ungraded village school curriculum was too slow  for Rupert; and when one spring the young reservoir projector"]]]
