But I knew you right away, only, of course, I wasn't going  to tell those boys who you were. It served them right, for squeezing me  the way they did. Now we'll go on, and see if we can find a fortune for  you.\"    So they went back to where Uncle Wiggily had left his valise, and there it  was safe and sound, and inside it were some nice things to eat, and the  rabbit and doggie had a dinner there in the woods, after the mud stripes  were washed off.    Then they went on and on, for ever so long, and nothing happened, except  that a mosquito bit Fido on the end of his nose, and every time he sneezed  it tickled him.    \"Well, I guess we won't have any more adventures to-day, Uncle Wiggily,\"  spoke the doggie, but, a moment later, they heard a rustling in the bushes  and, before they could hide themselves, out jumped Arabella Chick, the  sister of Charlie, the rooster boy.    \"Oh, you dear Uncle Wiggily!\" she exclaimed, \"you're just in time.\"    \"What for?\" asked Uncle Wiggily; \"for the train?\"    \"No, for my party,\" answered Arabella. \"I'm going to have one for all my  friends, and I want you to come. Will you?\"    \"Oh, I guess so, Arabella. But you see, I have a friend with me, and----\"    \"Oh, he can come too,\" spoke Arabella, making a bow to Fido Flip-Flop. So  Uncle Wiggily introduced the doggie to the chickie girl, and the chickie  girl to the doggie.    Then they went on together to the party, which was held in a nice big  chicken coop.    Oh, I wish you could have been there! It was just too nice for anything!  Sammie and Susie Littletail were there, and they were so glad to see Uncle  Wiggily again. He said he hadn't been very lucky in finding his fortune so  far, but his rheumatism was not much worse, and he was going to keep on  traveling. He sent his love to all the folks, and said he'd be home some  time later.    Then, of course, all the other animal friends were at the party and they  played games--games of all kinds, including a new one called \"Please don't  sit on my hat, and I won't sit on yours.\" It was too funny for anything,  really it was.    Then, of course, there were good things to eat. Buddy Pigg passed around  the ice cream, and just as he was handing a plate of it to Jennie Chipmunk  it slipped--I mean the ice cream slipped--and went right into Uncle  Butter's lap. But the old goat didn't care a bit. He said it reminded him  of a pail of paste, and he ate the ice cream, and Nurse Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy  got Jennie some more.    Then Flip-Flop and Uncle Wiggily did some of their tricks, and every one  said they were fine, and they thought it was the best party they had ever  been at.    But all of a sudden, just as they were playing the game called \"Jump on  the piano, and play a queer tune,\" there came a knock at the door.    \"Who's there?\" asked Arabella Chick.    \"I am,\" answered a voice, \"and I want Uncle Wiggily Longears instantly! He  must come with me!\" And they all looked from the window, and there stood a  big dog, dressed up like a soldier, and he had a gun with him. And he  wanted Uncle Wiggily to come out, and every one was frightened, for fear  he'd shoot the old gentleman rabbit.    But please don't you get alarmed. I wouldn't have that happen for worlds,  and in the next story, if I catch a fish in the milk bottle, and he  doesn't bite my finger, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily in a parade. And  it will be a Decoration Day story.          STORY VII    UNCLE WIGGILY IN A PARADE      Arabella Chick's party seemed to break up very suddenly when the guests  saw that soldier-dog with the gun waiting outside the door. Buddy Pigg  slipped out of a back window, and ran home with his tail behind him. Oh,  excuse me, guinea pigs don't have a tail, do they? Anyhow he ran home, and  so did Sammie and Susie Littletail, and Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, and  the Wibblewobble children, and Peetie and Jackie Bow Wow too.    But, of course, Arabella Chick couldn't run home because she was at home  already, so she just looked out of the window once more, and there the  dog-soldier stood, and he was looking in his gun to see if it was loaded.    \"Well, is Uncle Wiggily coming out?\" called the dog again.    \"I guess I am--that is--are you sure you want me?\" asked the poor old  gentleman rabbit, puzzled like.    \"Yes, of course I want you,\" replied the dog.    \"Then I guess I've got to go!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he looked for  his crutch and valise. \"I guess this is the end of my fortune-hunting.  Goodbye everybody!\" And he felt so badly that two big tears rolled down  his ears--I mean his eyes.    Well, he bravely walked out of the door, and as he did so the dog-soldier,  with the gun, exclaimed:    \"Ah, here you are at last! Now hurry up, Uncle Wiggily, or we'll be late  for the parade!\"    And, would you believe it? that dog was good, kind, old Percival, who used  to be in a circus. And of course he wouldn't hurt the rabbit gentleman for  anything. Percival just put his gun to his shoulder, and said:    \"Come on, we'll get in the parade now.\"    \"Parade? What parade?\" asked Uncle Wiggily. \"Oh my! how you frightened  me!\"    \"Why the Decoration Day parade,\" answered Percival. \"To-day is the day  when we put flowers on the soldiers' graves, and remember them for being  so brave as to go to war. All old soldiers march in the parade, and so do  all their friends. I'm going to march, and I'm going to put flowers on a  lot of soldiers' graves. I happened to remember that you were once in the  war, so I came for you. I didn't mean to scare you. You were in the war,  weren't you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Uncle Wiggily, happy now because he knew he wasn't going to  get shot, \"I once went to war, and killed a lot of mosquitoes.\"    \"Good! I thought so!\" exclaimed Percival. \"Well, I met Grandfather Goosey  Gander, and he said he thought you were at this party, so I came for you.  Come on, now, the parade is almost ready to start.\"    \"Oh, how you did frighten us!\" exclaimed Arabella, whose heart was still  going pitter-patter. \"We thought you were going to hurt Uncle Wiggily,  Percival.\"    \"Oh, I'm so sorry I alarmed you,\" spoke the circus dog politely. \"I won't  do it again.\"    Well, in a little while Percival and Uncle Wiggily were at the parade. The  old gentleman rabbit left his satchel at Arabella's house, and only took  his crutch. But he limped along just like a real soldier, and Percival  carried his gun as bravely as one could wish.    Oh, I wish you could have heard the bands playing, and the drums  beating--the little kind that sound like when you drop beans on the  kitchen oil-cloth, and the big drums, that go \"Boom-boom!\" like thunder  and lightning, and the fifes that squeak like a mouse in the cheese trap,  and then the big blaring horns, that make a sound like a circus  performance.    They were all there, and there were lots of soldiers and horses and wagons  filled with flowers to put on the graves of the soldiers, who were so  brave that they didn't mind going to war to fight for their country,  though war is a terrible thing.    Then the march began, and Uncle Wiggily and Percival stepped out as brave  as anyone in all the parade. Oh, how fine they looked! and, when they  marched past, all the animal people, and some real boys and girls, and  papas and mammas clapped their hands and cried \"Hurrah!\" at the sight of  the old gentleman rabbit limping along on his crutch, with the dog-soldier  marching beside him.    \"Who knows,\" whispered Percival to Uncle Wiggily, \"who knows but what you  may discover your fortune to-day?\"    \"Indeed I may,\" answer Uncle Wiggily. \"Who knows?\"    Well, that was a fine parade. But something happened. I was afraid it  would, but I'll tell you all about it, and you can see for yourself  whether or not I was right.    All of a sudden one man, with a big horn--a horn large enough to put a  loaf of mother's bread down inside the noisy end--all of a sudden this man  blew a terrible blast--\"Umpty-umpty-Umph! Umph!\" My, what a noise he made  on that horn.    Now, right in front of this man was a little boy-duck riding on a pony.  Yes, you've guessed who he was--he was Jimmy Wibblewobble. And when that  man blew the loud blast, the pony was frightened, and ran away with Jimmie  on his back.    Faster and faster ran the pony, and Jimmie Wibblewobble clung to his back,  fearing every moment he would be thrown off. In and out among the people  and animals in the parade, in and out among trolley cars and automobiles,  in and out, and from one side to another of the street ran the frightened  pony.    \"Oh, poor Jimmie will be killed!\" cried Percival.    \"No, he will not, for I will save him!\" shouted Uncle Wiggily. So that  brave rabbit ran right out to where he saw Munchie Trot, the little pony  boy.    \"Let me jump on your back, Munchie,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"and then we'll  race after that runaway pony and grab off poor Jimmie. And run as fast as  you can, Munchie!\"    \"I certainly will!\" cried Munchie. So Uncle Wiggily got on Munchie's back,  and away they started after the runaway pony.    Faster and faster ran Munchie, and by this time the other little horsie  was getting tired. Jimmie was still clinging to his back, and asking him  not to run so fast, but the pony was so frightened he didn't listen to the  duck-boy.    Then, just as he was going to run into a hot peanut wagon, and maybe toss  Jimmie off into the red-hot roaster, all at once Uncle Wiggily, on  Munchie's back, galloped up alongside of the runaway pony. And as quick as  you can drink a glass of lemonade, Uncle Wiggily grabbed Jimmie up on  Munchie's back beside him, and so saved the duck-boy's life. And then the  runaway pony stopped short, all of a sudden, and didn't bump into the hot  peanut wagon, after all, and he was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#5)"],[1,"the  direction of its flow, the velocity and volume of its current. Every new  flood tends to fit itself approximately into the old banks, seeks first  these lines of least resistance, and only when it finds them blocked or  pre-empted does it turn to more difficult paths.    [Sidenote: Regions of historical similarity.]    Geographical environment, through the persistence of its influence,  acquires peculiar significance. Its effect is not restricted to a given  historical event or epoch, but, except when temporarily met by some  strong counteracting force, tends to make itself felt under varying  guise in all succeeding history. It is the permanent element in the  shifting fate of races. Islands show certain fundamental points of  agreement which can be distinguished in the economic, ethnic and  historical development of England, Japan, Melanesian Fiji, Polynesian  New Zealand, and pre-historic Crete. The great belt of deserts and  steppes extending across the Old World gives us a vast territory of rare  historical uniformity. From time immemorial they have borne and bred  tribes of wandering herdsmen; they have sent out the invading hordes  who, in successive waves of conquest, have overwhelmed the neighboring  river lowlands of Eurasia and Africa. They have given birth in turn to  Scythians, Indo-Aryans, Avars, Huns, Saracens, Tartars and Turks, as to  the Tuareg tribes of the Sahara, the Sudanese and Bantu folk of the  African grasslands. But whether these various peoples have been Negroes,  Hamites, Semites, Indo-Europeans or Mongolians, they have always been  pastoral nomads. The description given by Herodotus of the ancient  Scythians is applicable in its main features to the Kirghis and Kalmuck  who inhabit the Caspian plains to-day. The environment of this dry  grassland operates now to produce the same mode of life and social  organization as it did 2,400 years ago; stamps the cavalry tribes of  Cossacks as it did the mounted Huns, energizes its sons by its dry  bracing air, toughens them by its harsh conditions of life, organizes  them into a mobilized army, always moving with its pastoral  commissariat. Then when population presses too hard upon the meager  sources of subsistence, when a summer drought burns the pastures and  dries up the water-holes, it sends them forth on a mission of conquest,  to seek abundance in the better watered lands of their agricultural  neighbors. Again and again the productive valleys of the Hoangho, Indus,  Ganges, Tigris and Euphrates, Nile, Volga, Dnieper and Danube have been  brought into subjection by the imperious nomads of arid Asia, just as  the \"hoe-people\" of the Niger and upper Nile have so often been  conquered by the herdsmen of the African grasslands. Thus, regardless of  race or epoch--Hyksos or Kaffir--history tends to repeat itself in these  rainless tracts, and involves the better watered districts along their  borders when the vast tribal movements extend into these peripheral  lands.    [Illustration: DENSITY OF POPULATION IN EASTERN HEMISPHERE]    [Illustration: DENSITY OF POPULATION IN WESTERN HEMISPHERE]    [Sidenote: Climatic influences.]    Climatic influences are persistent, often obdurate in their control.  Arid regions permit agriculture and sedentary life only through  irrigation. The economic prosperity of Egypt to-day depends as  completely upon the distribution of the Nile waters as in the days of  the Pharaohs. The mantle of the ancient Egyptian priest has fallen upon  the modern British engineer. Arctic explorers have succeeded only by  imitating the life of the Eskimos, adopting their clothes, food, fuel,  dwellings, and mode of travel. Intense cold has checked both native and  Russian development over that major portion of Siberia lying north of  the mean annual isotherm of degree C. (32 degrees F.); and it has had a  like effect in the corresponding part of Canada. (Compare maps pages 8  and 9.) It allows these sub-arctic lands scant resources and a  population of less than two to the square mile. Even with the intrusion  of white colonial peoples, it perpetuates the savage economy of the  native hunting tribes, and makes the fur trader their modern exploiter,  whether he be the Cossack tribute-gatherer of the lower Lena River, or  the factor of the Hudson Bay Company. The assimilation tends to be  ethnic as well as economic, because the severity of the climate excludes  the white woman. The debilitating effects of heat and humidity, aided by  tropical diseases, soon reduce intruding peoples to the dead level of  economic inefficiency characteristic of the native races. These, as the  fittest, survive and tend to absorb the new-comers, pointing to  hybridization as the simplest solution of the problem of tropical  colonization.    [Sidenote: The relation of geography to history.]    The more the comparative method is applied to the study of  history--and this includes a comparison not only of different  countries, but also of successive epochs in the same country--the more  apparent becomes the influence of the soil in which humanity is  rooted, the more permanent and necessary is that influence seen to be.  Geography's claim to make scientific investigation of the physical  conditions of historical events is then vindicated. \"Which was there  first, geography or history?\" asks Kant. And then comes his answer:  \"Geography lies at the basis of history.\" The two are inseparable.  History takes for its field of investigation human events in various  periods of time; anthropo-geography studies existence in various  regions of terrestrial space. But all historical development takes  place on the earth's surface, and therefore is more or less molded by  its geographic setting. Geography, to reach accurate conclusions, must  compare the operation of its factors in different historical periods  and at different stages of cultural development. It therefore regards  history in no small part as a succession of geographical factors  embodied in events. Back of Massachusetts' passionate abolition  movement, it sees the granite soil and boulder-strewn fields of New  England; back of the South's long fight for the maintenance of  slavery, it sees the rich plantations of tidewater Virginia and the  teeming fertility of the Mississippi bottom lands. This is the  significance of Herder's saying that \"history is geography set into  motion.\" What is to-day a fact of geography becomes to-morrow a factor  of history. The two sciences cannot be held apart without doing  violence to both, without dismembering what is a natural, vital whole.  All historical problems ought to be studied geographically and all  geographic problems must be studied historically. Every map has its  date. Those in the Statistical Atlas of the United States showing the  distribution of population from 1790 to 1890 embody a mass of history  as well as of geography. A map of France or the Russian Empire has a  long historical perspective; and on the other hand, without that map  no change of ethnic or political boundary, no modification in routes  of communication, no system of frontier defences or of colonization,  no scheme of territorial aggrandizement can be understood.    [Sidenote: Multiplicity of geographic factors.]    The study of physical environment as a factor in history was  unfortunately brought into disrepute by extravagant and ill-founded  generalization, before it became the object of investigation according  to modern scientific methods. And even to-day principles advanced in the  name of anthropo-geography are often superficial, inaccurate, based upon  a body of data too limited as to space and time, or couched in terms of  unqualified statement which exposes them to criticism or refutation.  Investigators in this field, moreover, are prone to get a squint in  their eye that makes them see one geographic factor to the exclusion of  the rest; whereas it belongs to the very nature of physical environment  to combine a whole group of influences, working all at the same time  under the law of the resolution of forces. In this plexus of influences,  some operate in one direction and some in another; now one loses its  beneficent effect like a medicine long used or a garment outgrown;  another waxes in power, reinforced by a new geographic factor which has  been released from dormancy by the expansion of the known world, or the  progress of invention and of human development.    [Sidenote: Evolution of geographic relations.]    These complex geographic influences cannot be analyzed and their  strength estimated except from the standpoint of evolution. That is one  reason these half-baked geographic principles rest heavy on our mental  digestion. They have been formulated without reference to the  all-important fact that the geographical relations of man, like his  social and political organization, are subject to the law of  development. Just as the embryo state found in the primitive Saxon tribe  has passed through many phases in attaining the political character of  the present British Empire, so every stage in this maturing growth has  been accompanied or even preceded by a steady evolution of the  geographic relations of the English people.    Owing to the evolution of geographic relations, the physical environment  favorable to one stage of development may be adverse to another, and  _vice versa_. For instance, a small, isolated and protected habitat,  like that of Egypt, Phoenicia, Crete and Greece, encourages the birth  and precocious growth of civilization; but later it may cramp progress,  and lend the stamp of arrested development to a people who were once the  model for all their little world. Open and wind-swept Russia, lacking  these small, warm nurseries where Nature could cuddle her children, has  bred upon its boundless plains a massive, untutored, homogeneous folk,  fed upon the crumbs of culture that have fallen from the richer tables  of"]]]
