[TRANSLATION.]    Before AMICE DE CARTERET, Esq., Bailiff, and the Jurats.    _JULY 4th, 1617._    SENTENCE OF DEATH.    _Collette du Mont_, widow of _Jean Becquet_; _Marie_, her daughter,  wife of _Pierre Massy_; and _Isabel Becquet_, wife of _Jean Le  Moygne_, being by common rumour and report for a long time past  addicted to the damnable art of Witchcraft, and the same being  thereupon seized and apprehended by the Officers of His Majesty [James  I.], after voluntarily submitting themselves, both upon the general  inquest of the country, and after having been several times brought up  before the Court, heard, examined, and confronted, upon a great number  of depositions made and produced before the Court by the said  Officers; from which it is clear and evident that for many years past  the aforesaid women have practiced the diabolical art of Witchcraft,  by having not only cast their spells upon inanimate objects, but also  by having retained in languor through strange diseases, many persons  and beasts; and also cruelly hurt a great number of men, women, and  children, and caused the death of many animals, as recorded in the  informations thereupon laid, it follows that they are clearly  convicted and proved to be Witches. In expiation of which crime it has  been ordered by the Court that the said women shall be presently  conducted, with halters about their necks, to the usual place of  punishment, and shall there be fastened by the Executioner to a  gallows, and be hanged, strangled, killed, and burnt, until their  flesh and bones are reduced to ashes, and the ashes shall be  scattered; and all their goods, chattels, and estates, if any such  exist, shall be forfeited to His Majesty. In order to make them  disclose their accomplices, they shall be put to the question before  the Court, previous to being executed.      Sentence de mort ayant este prononcee a l'encontre de _Collette Du  Mont_, veuve de _Jean Becquet_, _Marie_, sa fille, femme de _Pierre  Massy_, et _Isbel Becquet_, femme de _Jean Le Moygne_, auroyent  icelles confesse comme suit:--    CONFESSION DE COLLETTE DU MONT.    Premier, la diste _Collette_ immediatement appres la dyte sentence  donnee, et avant que de sortir de l'auditoire, a librement recognu  qu'elle estoit Sorciere; toutesfois ne voulant particularizer les  crimes qu'auroit commis a este conduite avec les autres en la Maison  de la Question, et la dite question luy estant applicquee, a confesse  qu'elle estoit encore jeune lors que le Diable en forme de chat:  s'aparut a elle: en la Paroisse de Torteval: lors qu'elle retournoit  de son bestiall, estant encore jour, et qu'il print occasion de la  seduire, par l'inciter a se venger d'un de ses voisins avec lequell  elle estoit pour lors en querelle pour quelque domage qu'elle auroit  receu par les bestes d'yceluy; que depuis lors qu'elle avoit eu  querelle avec quelcun, ill se representoit a elle en la susdite forme:  et quelquefois en forme de chien: l'induisant a se venger de ceux  contre lesquels elle estoit faschee: la persuadant de faire mourir des  personnes et bestes.    Que le Diable l'estant venue querir pour aller au Sabat, l'appelloit  sans qu'on s'en apperceust: et luy bailloit ung certain onguent noir,  duquel (appres s'etre despouillee) elle se frotoit le dos, ventre et  estomac: et s'estant revestue, sortoit hors son huis, lors estoit  incontinent emportee par l'air d'une grande vitesse: et se trouvoit a  l'instant au lieu du Sabat, qui estoit quelquefois pres le cimetiere  de la paroisse: et quelques autres fois pres le rivage de la mer, aux  environs du Chateau de Rocquaine: la ou estant arivee s'y rencontroit  souvent quinze ou saize Sorciers et Sorcieres avec les Diables, qu'y  estoient la en forme de chiens, chats, et lievres: lesquels Sorciers  et Sorcieres elle n'a peu recognoistre, parce qu'ils estoyent tous  noircis et deffigures: bien est vray avoir ouy le Diable les evocquer  par leur noms, et se souvaient entre autres de la _Fallaise_, et de la  _Hardie_; dit confesse qu'a l'entree du Sabath: le Diable les voulant  esvosquer commencoit par elle quelquefois. Que sa fille _Marie_, femme  de _Massy_, a present condamnee pour pareill crime, est Sorciere: et  qu'elle la menee par deux fois au Sabath avec elle: ne scait par ou le  Diable la merchee: qu'au Sabath appres avoir adore le Diable, lequell  se tenoit debout sur ses pieds de derriere, ils avoient copulation  avec luy en forme de chien; puis dansoyent dos a dos. Et appres avoir  danse, beuvoyent du vin (ne scait de quelle couleur), que le Diable  versoit hors d'un pot en ung gobelet d'argent ou d'estrain; lequell  vin ne luy sembloit sy bon que celuy qu'on boit ordinarement;  mangeoist aussy du pain blanc quj leur presentoit--n'a jamais veu de  sell au Sabath.    Confesse que le Diable luy avoit donne charge d'appeler en passant  _Isebell le Moygne_: lors quelle viendroit au Sabath, ce qu'elle a  fait diverses fois. Qu'au partir du Sabath le Diable l'incitoit a  perpetrer plusieurs maux: et pour cest effect luy bailloit certaines  pouldres noires, qu'il lui commandoit de ietter sur telles personnes  et bestes qu'elle voudroit; avec laquelle pouldre elle a perpetre  plusieurs maux desquels ne se souvient: entres autres en ietta sur  _Mes. Dolbell_, ministre de la paroisse: et fut occasion de sa mort  par ce moyen. Par ceste mesme pouldre ensorcela la femme de _Jean  Maugues_: toutesfois nie qu'elle soit morte par son sort: qu'elle  toucha par le coste, et ietta de ceste pouldre sur la femme defuncte  de _Mr Perchard_, successeur ministre du dit _Dolbell_, en ycelle  paroisse, ycelle estant pour lors enceinte, tellement qu'elle la fist  mourir et son fruit--ne scait quelle occasion luy fut donnee par la  dite femme.    Que sur le refus que la femme de _Collas Tottevin_ luy fist de luy  donner du laict: elle fist assecher sa vache, en iettant sur ycelle de  ceste pouldre: laquelle vache elle regarit par appres en luy faisant  manger du son, et de l'herbe terrestre que le Diable lui bailla.      Sentence of Death having been pronounced against _Collette Du Mont_,  widow of _Jean Becquet_; _Marie_, her daughter, wife of _Pierre  Massy_; and _Isabel Becquet_, wife of _Jean Le Moygne_; the same have  confessed as follows:--    CONFESSION OF COLLETTE DU MONT.    First, the said _Collette_ immediately after the said sentence was  pronounced, and before leaving the Court, freely admitted that she was  a Witch; at the same time, not wishing to specify the crimes which she  had committed, she was taken, along with the others, to the Torture  Chamber, and the said question being applied to her, she confessed  that she was quite young when the Devil, in the form of a cat:  appeared to her: in the Parish of Torteval: as she was returning from  her cattle, it being still daylight, and that he took occasion to lead  her astray by inciting her to avenge herself on one of her neighbours,  with whom she was then at enmity, on account of some damage which she  had suffered through the cattle of the latter; that since then when  she had a quarrel with anyone, he appeared to her in the aforesaid  form: and sometimes in the form of a dog: inducing her to take  vengence upon those who had angered her: persuading her to cause the  death of persons and cattle.    That the Devil having come to fetch her that she might go to the  Sabbath, called for her without anyone perceiving it: and gave her a  certain black ointment with which (after having stripped herself), she  rubbed her back, belly and stomach: and then having again put on her  clothes, she went out of her door, when she was immediately carried  through the air at a great speed: and she found herself in an instant  at the place of the Sabbath, which was sometimes near the parochial  burial-ground: and at other times near the seashore in the  neighbourhood of Rocquaine Castle: where, upon arrival, she met often  fifteen or sixteen Wizards and Witches with the Devils who were there  in the form of dogs, cats, and hares: which Wizards and Witches she  was unable to recognise, because they were all blackened and  disfigured: it was true, however, that she had heard the Devil summon  them by their names, and she remembered among others those of  _Fallaise_ and _Hardie_; confessed that on entering the Sabbath: the  Devil wishing to summon them commenced with her sometimes. Admitted  that her daughter _Marie_, wife of _Massy_, now condemned for a  similar crime, was a Witch: and that she took her twice to the Sabbath  with her: at the Sabbath, after having worshipped the Devil, who used  to stand up on his hind legs, they had connection with him under the  form of a dog; then they danced back to back. And after having danced,  they drank wine (she did not know what colour it was), which the Devil  poured out of a jug into a silver or pewter goblet; which wine did not  seem to her so good as that which was usually drunk; they also ate  white bread which he presented to them--she had never seen any salt at  the Sabbath.    Confessed that the Devil had charged her to call, as she passed, for  _Isabel le Moygne_: when she came to the Sabbath, which she had done  several times. On leaving the Sabbath the Devil incited her to commit  various evil deeds: and to that effect he gave"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17208"],[0,"The Tales of Mother Goose (#5)"],[1," his wife reached home the lord of  the manor sent them ten crowns, which he had long owed them, and which  they never hoped to see. This gave them new life, for the poor people  were dying of hunger. The fagot-maker sent his wife to the butcher's at  once. As it was a long while since they had eaten, she bought thrice as  much meat as was needed for supper for two people. When they had eaten,  the woman said:--    \"Alas! where are our poor children now? They would make a good feast of  what we have left here; it was you, William, who wished to lose them. I  told you we should repent of it. What are they now doing in the forest?  Alas! perhaps the wolves have already eaten them up; you are very  inhuman thus to have lost your children.\"    The fagot-maker grew at last quite out of patience, for she repeated  twenty times that he would repent of it, and that she was in the right.  He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue. The  fagot-maker was, perhaps, more sorry than his wife, but she teased him  so he could not endure it. She wept bitterly, saying:--    \"Alas! where are my children now, my poor children?\"    She said this once so very loud that the children, who were at the door,  heard her and cried out all together:--    \"Here we are! Here we are!\"    She ran immediately to let them in, and said as she embraced them:--    \"How happy I am to see you again, my dear children; you are very tired  and very hungry, and, my poor Peter, you are covered with mud. Come in  and let me clean you.\"    Peter was her eldest son, whom she loved more than all the rest, because  he was red haired, as she was herself.    They sat down to table, and ate with an appetite which pleased both  father and mother, to whom they told how frightened they were in the  forest, nearly all speaking at once. The good folk were delighted to see  their children once more, and this joy continued while the ten crowns  lasted. But when the money was all spent, they fell again into their  former uneasiness, and resolved to lose their children again. And, that  they might be the surer of doing it, they determined to take them much  farther than before.    They could not talk of this so secretly but they were overheard by  Little Thumb, who laid his plans to get out of the difficulty as he had  done before; but, though he got up very early to go and pick up some  little pebbles, he could not, for he found the house-door double-locked.  He did not know what to do. Their father had given each of them a piece  of bread for their breakfast. He reflected that he might make use of the  bread instead of the pebbles, by throwing crumbs all along the way they  should pass, and so he stuffed it in his pocket. Their father and mother  led them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forest, and  then, stealing away into a by-path, left them there. Little Thumb was  not very much worried about it, for he thought he could easily find the  way again by means of his bread, which he had scattered all along as he  came; but he was very much surprised when he could not find a single  crumb: the birds had come and eaten them all.    They were now in great trouble; for the more they wandered, the deeper  they went into the forest. Night now fell, and there arose a high wind,  which filled them with fear. They fancied they heard on every side the  howling of wolves coming to devour them. They scarce dared to speak or  turn their heads. Then it rained very hard, which wetted them to the  skin. Their feet slipped at every step, and they fell into the mud,  covering their hands with it so that they knew not what to do with them.    Little Thumb climbed up to the top of a tree, to see if he could  discover anything. Looking on every side, he saw at last a glimmering  light, like that of a candle, but a long way beyond the forest. He came  down, and, when upon the ground, he could see it no more, which  grieved him sadly. However, having walked for some time with his  brothers toward that side on which he had seen the light, he discovered  it again as he came out of the wood.    They arrived at last at the house where this candle was, not without  many frights; for very often they lost sight of it, which happened  every time they came into a hollow. They knocked at the door, and a good  woman came and opened it.    She asked them what they wanted. Little Thumb told her they were poor  children who were lost in the forest, and desired to lodge there for  charity's sake. The woman, seeing them all so very pretty, began to weep  and said to them: \"Alas! poor babies, where do you come from? Do you  know that this house belongs to a cruel Ogre who eats little children?\"    \"Alas! dear madam,\" answered Little Thumb (who, with his brothers, was  trembling in every limb), \"what shall we do? The wolves of the forest  surely will devour us to-night if you refuse us shelter in your house;  and so we would rather the gentleman should eat us. Perhaps he may take  pity upon us if you will be pleased to ask him to do so.\"    The Ogre's wife, who believed she could hide them from her husband till  morning, let them come in, and took them to warm themselves at a very  good fire; for there was a whole sheep roasting for the Ogre's supper.    As they began to warm themselves they heard three or four great raps at  the door; this was the Ogre, who was come home. His wife quickly hid  them under the bed and went to open the door. The Ogre at once asked if  supper was ready and the wine drawn, and then sat himself down to  table. The sheep was as yet all raw, but he liked it the better for  that. He sniffed about to the right and left, saying:--    \"I smell fresh meat.\"    \"What you smell,\" said his wife, \"must be the calf which I have just now  killed and flayed.\"    \"I smell fresh meat, I tell you once more,\" replied the Ogre, looking  crossly at his wife, \"and there is something here which I do not  understand.\"    As he spoke these words he got up from the table and went straight to  the bed.    \"Ah!\" said he, \"that is how you would cheat me; I know not why I do not  eat you, too; it is well for you that you are tough. Here is game, which  comes very luckily to entertain three Ogres of my acquaintance who are  to pay me a visit in a day or two.\"    He dragged them out from under the bed, one by one. The poor children  fell upon their knees and begged his pardon, but they had to do with one  of the most cruel of Ogres, who, far from having any pity on them, was  already devouring them in his mind, and told his wife they would be  delicate eating when she had made a good sauce.    He then took a great knife, and, coming up to these poor children,  sharpened it upon a great whetstone which he held in his left hand. He  had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him:--    \"What need you do it now? Will you not have time enough to-morrow?\"    \"Hold your prating,\" said the Ogre; \"they will eat the tenderer.\"    \"But you have so much meat already,\" replied his wife; \"here are a calf,  two sheep, and half a pig.\"    \"That is true,\" said the Ogre; \"give them a good supper that they may  not grow thin, and put them to bed.\"    The good woman was overjoyed at this, and gave them a good supper; but  they were so much afraid that they could not eat. As for the Ogre, he  sat down again to drink, being highly pleased that he had the  wherewithal to treat his friends. He drank a dozen glasses more than  ordinary, which got up into his head and obliged him to go to bed.    The Ogre had seven daughters, who were still little children. These  young Ogresses had all of them very fine complexions; but they all had  little gray eyes, quite round, hooked noses, a very large mouth, and  very long, sharp teeth, set far apart. They were not as yet wicked, but  they promised well to be, for they had already bitten little children.    They had been put to bed early, all seven in one bed, with every one a  crown of gold upon her head. There was in the same chamber a bed of the  like size, and the Ogre's wife put the seven little boys into this bed,  after which she went to bed herself.    Little Thumb, who had observed that the Ogre's daughters had crowns of  gold upon their heads, and was afraid lest the Ogre should repent his  not killing them that evening, got up about midnight, and, taking his  brothers' bonnets and his own, went very softly and put them upon the  heads of the seven little Ogresses, after having taken off their crowns  of gold, which he put upon his own head and his brothers', so that the  Ogre might take them for his daughters, and his daughters for the little  boys whom he wanted to kill.    Things turned out just as he had thought; for the Ogre, waking about  midnight, regretted that he had deferred till morning to do that which  he might have done overnight, and jumped quickly out of bed, taking his  great knife.    \"Let us see,\" said he, \"how our little rogues do, and not make two jobs  of the matter.\"    He then went up, groping all the way, into his daughters' chamber; and,  coming to the bed where the little boys lay, and who were all fast  asleep, except Little Thumb, who was terribly afraid when he found the  Ogre fumbling about his head, as he had done about his brothers', he  felt the golden crowns, and said:--    \"I should have made a fine piece of work of it, truly; it is clear I  drank too much last night.\"    Then he went to the bed where the girls lay, and, having found the boys'  little bonnets:--    \"Ah!\" said he, \"my merry lads, are you there? Let us work boldly.\"    And saying these words, without more ado, he cruelly murdered all his  seven daughters. Well pleased with what he had done, he went to bed  again.    So soon as Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore, he waked his brothers, and  bade them put on their clothes quickly and follow him. They stole softly  into the garden and got over the wall. They ran about, all night,  trembling all "]]]
