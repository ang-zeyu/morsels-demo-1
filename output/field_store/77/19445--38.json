To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#5)"],[1,"the  magistrate; many devout Romans had begun to keep holy the seventh day;  and Egypt was now so closely joined to Italy that the Roman senate made  a new law against the Egyptian and Jewish superstitions, and, in A.D.  19, banished to Sardinia four thousand men who were found guilty of  being Jews.    Egypt had lost with its liberties its gold coinage, and it was now  made to feel a further proof of being a conquered country in having its  silver much alloyed with copper. But Tiberius, in the tenth year of his  reign, altogether stopped the Alexandrian mint, as well as those of the  other cities which occasionally coined; and after this year we find no  more coins, but the few with the head and name of Augustus Caesar, which  seem hardly to have been meant for money, but to commemorate on some  peculiar occasions the emperor's adoption by his stepfather. The Nubian  gold mines were probably by this time wholly deserted; they had been so  far worked out as to be no longer profitable. For fifteen hundred years,  ever since Ethiopia was conquered by Thebes, wages and prices had been  higher in Egypt than in the neighbouring countries. But this was now no  longer the case. Egypt had been getting poorer during the reigns of the  latter Ptolemies; and by this time it is probable that both wages and  prices were higher in Rome.    It seems to have been usual to change the prefect of Egypt every few  years, and the prefect-elect was often sent to Alexandria to wait  till his predecessor's term of years had ended. Thus in this reign of  twenty-three years AEmilius Rectus was succeeded by Vetrasius Pollio;  and on his death Tiberius gave the government to his freedman Iberus.  During the last five years Egypt was under the able but stern government  of Flaccus Avillius, whose name is carved on the temple of Tentyra with  that of the emperor. He was a man who united all those qualities of  prudent forethought, with prompt execution and attention to business,  which was so necessary in controlling the irritable Alexandrians, who  were liable to be fired into rebellion by the smallest spark. Justice  was administered fairly; the great were not allowed to tyrannise over  the poor, nor the people to meet in tumultuous mobs; and the legions  were regularly paid, so that they had no excuse for plundering the  Egyptians.    On the death of Tiberius, in A.D. 37, the old quarrel again broke out  between Jews and Greeks. The Alexandrians were not slow in learning the  feelings of his successor, Caius, or Caligula, towards the Jews, nor  in turning against them the new law that the emperor's statue should  be honoured in every temple of the empire. They had very unwillingly  yielded a half-obedience to the law of Augustus that the Jews should  still be allowed the privileges of citizenship; and, as soon as they  heard that Caligula was to be worshipped in every temple of the empire,  they denounced the Jews as traitors and rebels, who refused so to honour  the emperor in their synagogues. It happened, unfortunately, that their  countryman, King Agrippa, at this time came to Alexandria. He had full  leave from the emperor to touch there, as being the quickest and most  certain way of making the voyage from Rome to the seat of his own  government. Indeed, the Alexandrian voyage had another merit in the eyes  of a Jew; for, whereas wooden water-vessels were declared by the Law to  be unclean, an exception was made by their tradition in favour of the  larger size of the water-wells in the Alexandrian ships. Agrippa had  seen Egypt before, on his way to Rome, and he meant to make no stay  there; but, though he landed purposely after dark, and with no pomp or  show, he seems to have raised the anger of the prefect Flaccus, who felt  jealous at any man of higher rank than himself coming into his province.  The Greeks fell into the prefect's humour, and during the stay of  Agrippa in Alexandria they lampooned him in songs and ballads, of which  the raillery was not of the most delicate kind. They mocked him by  leading about the streets a poor idiot dressed up with a paper crown and  a reed for a sceptre, in ridicule of his rather doubtful right to the  style of royalty.    As these insults towards the emperor's friend passed wholly unchecked  by the prefect, the Greeks next assaulted the Jews in the streets and  market-place, attacked their houses, rooted up the groves of trees  around their synagogues, and tore down the decree by which the  privileges of citizenship had been confirmed to them. The Greeks then  proceeded to set up by force a statue of the emperor in each Jewish  synagogue, as if the new decree had included those places of worship  among the temples, and, not finding statues enough, they made use of the  statues of the Ptolemies, which they carried away from the gymnasium  for that purpose. During the last reign, under the stern government  of Tiberius, Flaccus had governed with justice and prudence, but under  Caligula he seemed to have lost all judgment in his zeal against the  Jews. When the riots in the streets could no longer be overlooked,  instead of defending the injured party, he issued a decree in which  he styled the Jews foreigners; thus at one word robbing them of their  privileges and condemning them unheard. By this the Greeks were hurried  forward into further acts of injustice, and the Jews of resistance. But  the Jews were the weaker party: they were overpowered, and all driven  into one ward, and four hundred of their houses in the other wards were  plundered, and the spoil divided as if taken in war. They were stoned,  and even burnt in the streets, if they ventured forth to buy food for  their families. Flaccus seized and scourged in the theatre thirty-eight  of their venerable councillors, and, to show them that they were no  longer citizens, the punishment was inflicted by the hands of Egyptian  executioners. While the city was in this state of riot, the Greeks gave  out that the Jews were concealing arms; and Flaccus, to give them a  fresh proof that they had lost the rights of citizenship, ordered that  their houses should be forcibly entered and searched by a centurion and  a band of soldiers.    During their troubles the Jews had not been allowed to complain to the  emperor, or to send an embassy to Rome to make known their grievances.  But the Jewish King Agrippa, who was on his way from Rome to his  kingdom, forwarded to Caligula the complaints of his countrymen, the  Jews, with an account of the rebellious state of Alexandria. The riots,  it is true, had been wholly raised by the prefect's zeal in setting up  the emperor's statue in the synagogues to be worshipped by the Jews, and  in carrying into effect the emperor's decree; but, as he had not been  able to keep his province quiet, it was necessary that he should  be recalled, and punished for his want of success. To have found it  necessary to call out the troops was of course a fault in a governor;  but doubly so at a time and in a province where a successful general  might so easily become a formidable rebel. Accordingly, a centurion,  with a trusty cohort of soldiers, was sent from Rome for the recall  of the prefect. On approaching the flat coast of Egypt, they kept  the vessel in deep water till sunset, and then entered the harbour of  Alexandria in the dark. The centurion, on landing, met with a freedman  of the emperor, from whom he learned that the prefect was then at  supper, entertaining a large company of friends. The freedman led the  cohort quietly into the palace, into the very room where Flaccus was  sitting at table; and the first tidings that he heard of his government  being disapproved of in Rome was his finding himself a prisoner in his  own palace. The friends stood motionless with surprise, the centurion  produced the emperor's order for what he was doing, and as no resistance  was attempted all passed off quietly; Flaccus was hurried on board the  vessel then at anchor in the harbour on the same evening and immediately  taken to Rome.    It so happened that on the night that Flaccus was seized, the Jews  had met together to celebrate their autumnal feast, the feast of the  Tabernacles: not as in former years with joy and pomp, but in fear,  in grief, and in prayer. Their chief men were in prison, their nation  smarting under its wrongs and in daily fear of fresh cruelties; and it  was not without alarm that they heard the noise of soldiers moving to  and fro through the city, and the heavy tread of the guards marching by  torchlight from the camp to the palace. But their fear was soon turned  into joy when they heard that Flaccus, the author of all their wrongs,  was already a prisoner on board the vessel in the harbour; and they  gave glory to God, not, says Philo, that their enemy was going to be  punished, but because their own sufferings were at an end.    The Jews then, having had leave given them by the prefect, sent  an embassy to Rome, at the head of which was Philo, the platonic  philosopher, who was to lay their grievances before the emperor, and to  beg for redress. The Greeks also at the same time sent their embassy,  at the head of which was the learned grammarian Apion, who was to accuse  the Jews of not worshipping the statue of the emperor, and to argue that  they had no right to the same privileges of citizenship with those who  boasted of their Macedonian blood. But, as the Jews did not deny the  charge that was brought against them, Caligula would hear nothing that  they had to say; and Philo withdrew with the remark, \"Though the emperor  is against us, God will be our friend.\"    We learn the sad tale of the Jews' suffering under Caligula from the  pages of their own historian only. But though Philo may have felt and  written as one of the sufferers, his truth is undoubted. He was a man  of unblemished character, and the writer of greatest learning and of the  greatest note at that time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17332"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#5)"],[1,"r, had taken to flight after a short skirmish, and the  fortress was allowed to fall into the hands of the enemy (June, 1249).  Ayyub now established a firm footing in the town of Cairo--which his  father had founded--in a district intersected by canals, and harassed  the Christian camp with his light cavalry. Louis was expecting  reinforcements, but they did not arrive until the inundations of the  Nile made any advance into the interior almost impossible. At last, on  the 21st of December, the Christian army arrived at the canal of  Ashmum Tanah, which alone separated them from the town of Mansuria.  The Egyptians were now commanded by Emir Fakhr ed-Din. Ayyub had died  a month before, but his wife, Shejret ed-Durr, kept his death a secret  until his son Turan Shah should arrive from Mesopotamia. Fakhr ed-Din  did everything in his power to retrieve his former error. He attacked  the Christians when they were engaged in building a dam across  the canal, hindering their work on the southern bank with his  throwing-machines, destroying their towers with Greek fire; and when, in  spite of all discouragements, their toilsome work was nearly finished,  he rendered it useless by digging out a new basin, into which he  conducted the water of the Ashmum canal.    On the 8th of February, 1250, the French crossed the canal, but, instead  of collecting there, as the king had commanded, so as to attack the  enemy _en masse_, several troops pressed forward against the Egyptians,  and many, including the Count of Artois, the king's brother, were killed  by the valiant enemy under Beybars. The battle remained long undecided,  for the Egyptians had barricaded Cairo so well that it could only be  stormed at the cost of many lives, and after the capture the army needed  rest. The Egyptians took advantage of this delay to bring a fleet up  in the rear of the Egyptian ships, which, in combination with the fleet  stationed near Mansuria, attacked and completely destroyed them. As soon  as they were masters of the Nile, the Egyptians landed troops below the  Christian camp, which was thus completely cut off from Damietta, and  soon suffered the greatest hardships from lack of provisions. Under  these circumstances, Louis opened negotiations with Turan Shah, and  when these proved fruitless, nothing remained for him but to return to  Damietta. Although they began their retreat by night, they did not thus  escape the vigilance of the Egyptians. The fugitives were overtaken on  the following morning, and so shut in by the enemy that resistance was  impossible. A large portion of the army was cut to pieces, in spite of  their surrender; the rest, together with the king and his brother, were  taken prisoners and brought in triumph to Cairo. Turan Shah treated the  king with consideration and hastened to conclude peace with the Bahritic  Mamluks,--so called because they had been brought up on the Nile (Bahr),  on the island Rhodha,--as soon as the ransom money of his prisoners  was assured. The Bahrites grumbled at this peace because it left the  Christians in Palestine in possession of their towns, and they forthwith  murdered Turan Shah, with the help of Shejret ed-Durr, whom he had  maltreated (May 2, 1250).    After Turan Shah's death, his mother was proclaimed sultana, and the  Mamluk Aibek became general of the army. Later, when the caliph of  Baghdad revolted against the rule of a woman, Aibek assumed the title  of sultan and married Shejret ed-Durr. He ruled again after some time  in the name of a young descendant of Kamil, so as to be able to fight  against the Ayyubids in Syria, who, with En-Nasir at their head, had  taken possession of Damascus, with an appearance of right. A battle took  place between Aibek and the Syrians (February, 1251), which was decided  in favour of Aibek in consequence of the treachery of the Turks under  Nasir. Aibek again assumed the title of sultan after the victory, but  was soon after to be murdered by the Mamluks, who were unwilling to be  subject to any control. He anticipated their plot, however, and slew  their leader, the Emir Aktai, putting his followers to flight. He then  demanded the diploma of investiture and the insignia of his office  from the caliph, and also pressed the Prince of Mosul to grant him his  daughter in marriage. His own wife, unable to endure such perfidy, had  him murdered in his bath (April 10, 1257).    [Illustration: 032b]    When Beybars first ascended the throne, he assumed the name of Sultan  Kahir (the over-ruler), but afterwards, when he was informed that this  name had always brought misfortune to its bearer, he changed it to that  of Sultan Zahir (the Glorious).    Now that he was absolute master of Syria and Egypt, Beybars tried to  obliterate the remembrance of the misdeeds he had formerly been guilty  of by means of undertakings for the general good and for the furtherance  of religion. He had the mosques repaired, founded pious institutions,  designed new aqueducts, fortified Alexandria, had all the fortresses  repaired and provisioned which the Mongols had razed to the ground, had  a large number of great and small war-ships built, and established a  regular post between Cairo and Damascus. In order to obtain a semblance  of legitimacy, since he was but a usurper, Beybars recognised a nominal  descendant of the house of Abbas as caliph, who, in the proper course  of things, ought to invest him with the dominions of Syria and Egypt.  Beybars bade his governors receive this descendant of the house of the  Prophet with all suitable marks of honour, and invited him to come to  Egypt. When he approached the capital, the sultan himself went out to  meet him, followed by the vizier, the chief cadi, and the chief emirs  and notabilities of the town. Even the Jews and Christians had to take  part in the procession, carrying respectively the Tora and the Gospel.  The caliph made his entrance into Cairo with the greatest pomp, rode  through the town amidst the shouts of the multitude, and proceeded to  the citadel, where Beybars had appointed him a magnificent dwelling.  Some days afterwards the caliph had a reception of the chief cadi, the  most celebrated theologians and lawyers of Egypt, and many notables of  the capital. The Arabs who formed his escort and an eunuch from Baghdad  testified to the identity of the caliph's person, the chief cadi  recognised their assertion as valid, and was the first to do homage to  him as caliph. Thereupon the sultan arose, took the oath of allegiance  to him and swore to uphold both the written laws of the Koran and  those of tradition; to advance the good and hinder the evil, to fight  zealously for the protection of the faith only, to impose lawful taxes,  and to apply the taxes only to lawful purposes. After the sultan had  finished, homage was done by the sheiks, the emirs, and the other chief  officers of the kingdom. The caliph invested the sultan with power over  all the kingdoms subject to Islam, as well as over all future conquests,  whereupon the people of all classes were admitted to do homage likewise.  Then command was sent out to all the distant princes and governors to do  homage to the caliph, who has assumed the name of El-Mustanssir, and to  place his name beside that of the sultan in their prayers and also on  their coins.    Beybars' treatment of his viziers, governors, and other important emirs,  one or other of whom he either imprisoned or executed on every possible  occasion, was merciless, but he proceeded even more shamelessly against  Malik Mughith, Prince of Kerak and Shaubek, whom he feared so much as  one of the bravest descendants of the house of Ayyub that he stamped  himself publicly as a perjured assassin, in order to get him out of  the way. Beybars had at first, without any declaration of war, in fact,  without any notification of it in Egypt, suddenly sent a detachment of  troops under the leadership of Emir Bedr ed-Din Aidimri, which took the  fortress Shaubek by surprise, and placed the Emir Saif ed-Din Bilban  el-Mukhtasi in it as governor. In the next year, in order to win over  Mughith, he liberated his son Aziz, whom Kotuz had captured at Damascus  and imprisoned at Cairo; he also assured Mughith of his friendly  intentions towards him and repeatedly urged him to arrange a meeting.  El-Malik el-Mughith did not trust Beybars, and invented all kinds of  reasons not to accept his invitations. Beybars resolved at last to calm  the fears of his intended victim by means of a written oath. The fears  of Mughith, however, were not allayed, and he hesitated to fall in with  the wish of the sultan and to appear at his court. The following year,  when the sultan came to Syria and again urged a meeting, he was at a  loss for an excuse, and was forced either to acknowledge his mistrust  or risk everything. He sent his mother first to Gaza, where she was  received with the greatest friendliness by the sultan, and sent back  laden with costly presents; on her return to Kerak, corrupted by the  hospitality and generosity of the sultan, she persuaded her son to wait  on him, as did also his ambassador Alamjad with equal zeal. Finally he  set out from Kerak--when he had made his troops do homage to his son  El-Malik el-Aziz--on a visit to the sultan, who wras then in Tur. The  sultan rode out to meet him as far as Beisan. Malik Mughith wished to  dismount when he perceived the sultan, but he would not permit this, and  rode beside Mughith till he reached his own tent. Here he was separated  from his followers, thrown into chains, and brought into the citadel  of Cairo (a.h. 660). In order to palliate this crime, the sultan made  public the correspondence of the Prince of Kerak with the Mongols, which  it was thought would stamp the former as a traitor to Islam. The judges  whom he brought with him, and amongst whom we find the celebrated  historian Ibn Khallikan, who was then chief judge of Damascus, "]]]
