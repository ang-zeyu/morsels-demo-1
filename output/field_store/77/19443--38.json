Six, or at the most eight, months had sufficed to achieve these rapid  successes over various foes, in twenty different directions--the  expeditions in Nummi and Kirruri, the occupation of Kummukh, the flying  marches across the mountains and plains of Mesopotamia--during all of  which the new sovereign had given ample proof of his genius. He had, in  fine, shown himself to be a thorough soldier, a conqueror of the type  of Tiglath-pileser, and Assyria by these victories had recovered her  rightful rank among the nations of Western Asia.    The second year of his reign was no less fully occupied, nor did it  prove less successful than the first. At its very beginning, and even  before the return of the favourable season, the Sukhi on the Euphrates  made a public act of submission, and their chief, Ilubani, brought to  Nineveh on their behalf a large sum of gold and silver. He had scarcely  left the capital when the news of an untoward event effaced the good  impression he had made. The descendants of the colonists, planted in  bygone times by Shalmaneser I. on the western slope of the Masios, in  the district of Khalzidipkha, had thrown off their allegiance, and  their leader, Khulai, was besieging the royal fortress of Damdamusa.*  Assur-nazir-pal marched direct to the sources of the Tigris, and  the mere fact of his presence sufficed to prevent any rising in that  quarter. He took advantage of the occasion to set up a stele beside  those of his father Tukulti-ninip and his ancestor Tiglath-pileser,  and then having halted to receive the tribute of Izalla,** he turned  southwards, and took up a position on the slopes of the Kashiari.         * The position of Khalzidipkha or Khalzilukha, as well as       that of Kina-bu, its stronghold, is shown approximately by       what follows. Assur-nazir-pal, marching from the sources of       the Supnat towards Tela, could pass either to the east or       west of the Karajah-dagh; as the end of the campaign finds       him at Tushkhan, to the south of the Tigris, and he returns       to Nairi and Kirkhi by the eastern side of the Karajah-dagh,       we are led to conclude that the outgoing march to Tela was       by the western side, through the country situated between       the Karajah-dagh and the Euphrates. On referring to a modern       map, two rather important places will be found in this       locality: the first, Arghana, commanding the road from       Diarbekir to Khar-put; the other, Severek, on the route from       Diarbekir to Orfah. Arghana appears to me to correspond to       the royal city of Damdamusa, which would, thus have       protected the approach to the plain on the north-west.       Severek corresponds fairly well to the position which,       according to the Assyrian text, Kinabu must have occupied;       hence the country of Khalzidipkha (Khalzilukha) must be the       district of Severek.         ** Izalla, written also Izala, Azala, paid its tribute in       sheep and oxen, and also produced a wine for which it       continued to be celebrated down to the time of       Nebuchadrezzar II. Lenormant and Finzi place this country-       near to Nisibis, where the Byzantine and Syrian writers       mention a district and a mountain of the same name, and this       conjecture is borne out by the passages of the _Annals of       Assur-nazir-pal_ which place it in the vicinity of Bit-Adini       and Bit-Bakhiani. It has also been adopted by most of the       historians who have recently studied the question.    At the first news of his approach, Khulai had raised the blockade of  Damdamusa and had entrenched himself in Kinabu; the Assyrians, however,  carried the place by storm, and six hundred soldiers of the garrison  were killed in the attack. The survivors, to the number of three  thousand, together with many women and children, were, thrown into the  flames. The people of Mariru hastened to the rescue;* the Assyrians took  three hundred of them, prisoners and burnt them alive; fifty others  were ripped up, but the victors did not stop to reduce their town. The  district of Nirbu was next subjected to systematic ravaging, and half of  its inhabitants fled into the Mesopotamian desert, while the remainder  sought refuge in Tela at the foot of the Ukhira.**         * The site of Mariru is unknown; according to the text of       the Annals, it ought to lie near Severek (Kinabu) to the       south-east, since after having mentioned it, Assur-nazir-pal       speaks of the people of Nirbu whom he engaged in the desert       before marching against Tela.         ** Tila or Tela is the Tela Antoninopolis of the writers of       the Roman period and the present Veranshehr. The district of       Nirbu, of which it was the capital, lay on the southern       slope of the Karajah-dagh at the foot of Mount Urkhira, the       central group of the range. The name Kashiari is applied to       the whole mountain group which separates the basins of the       Tigris and Euphrates to the south and south-west.    The latter place was a strong one, being surrounded by three enclosing  walls, and it offered an obstinate resistance. Notwithstanding this, it  at length fell, after having lost three thousand of its defenders:--some  of its garrison were condemned to the stake, some had their hands,  noses, or ears cut off, others were deprived of sight, flayed alive,  or impaled amid the smoking ruins. This being deemed insufficient  punishment, the conqueror degraded the place from its rank of chief  town, transferring this, together with its other privileges, to a  neighbouring city, Tushkhan, which had belonged to the Assyrians from  the beginning of their conquests.* The king enlarged the place, added to  it a strong enclosing wall, and installed within it the survivors of the  older colonists who had been dispersed by the war, the majority of whom  had taken refuge in Shupria.**         * From this passage we learn that Tushkhan, also called       Tushkha, was situated on the border of Nirbu, while from       another passage in the campaign of the Vth year we find that       it was on the right bank of the Tigris. Following H.       Rawlinson, I place it at Kurkh, near the Tigris, to the east       of Diarbekir. The existence in that locality of an       inscription of Assur-nazir-pal appears to prove the       correctness of this identification; we are aware, in fact,       of the particular favour in which this prince held Tushkhan,       for he speaks with pride of the buildings with which he       embellished it. Hommel, however, identifies Kurkh with the       town of Matiato, of which mention is made further on.         ** Shupria or Shupri, a name which has been read Ruri, had       been brought into submission from the time of Shalmaneser I.       We gather from the passages in which it is mentioned that it       was a hilly country, producing wine, rich in flocks, and       lying at a short distance from Tushkhan; perhaps Mariru,       mentioned on p. 28, was one of its towns. I think we may       safely place it on the north-western slopes of the Kashiari,       in the modern caza of Tchernik, which possesses several       vineyards held in high estimation. Knudtzon, to whom we are       indebted for the reading of this name, places the country       rather further north, within the fork formed by the two       upper branches of the Tigris.    He constructed a palace there, built storehouses for the reception of  the grain of the province; and, in short, transformed the town into  a stronghold of the first order, capable of serving as a base of  operations for his armies. The surrounding princes, in the meanwhile,  rallied round him, including Ammibaal of Bit-Zamani, and the rulers  of Shupria, Nairi, and Urumi;* the chiefs of Eastern Nirbu alone held  aloof, emboldened by the rugged nature of their mountains and the  density of their forests. Assur-nazir-pal attacked them on his return  journey, dislodged them from the fortress of Ishpilibria where they were  entrenched, gained the pass of Buliani, and emerged into the valley of  Luqia.**         * The position of Bit-Zamani on the banks of the Euphrates       was determined by Delattre. Urumi was situated on the right       bank of the same river in the neighbourhood of Sumeisat, and       the name has survived in that of Urima, a town in the       vicinity so called even as late as Roman times. Nirdun, with       Madara as its capital, occupied part of the eastern slopes       of the Kashiari towards Ortaveran.         ** Hommel identifies the Luqia with the northern affluent of       the Euphrates called on the ancient monuments Lykos, and he       places the scene of the war in Armenia. The context obliges       us to look for this river to the south of the Tigris, to the       north-east and to the east of the Kashiari. The king coming       from Nirbu, the pass of Buliani, in which he finds the towns       of Kirkhi, must be the valley of Khaneki, in which the road       winds from Mardin to Diarbekir, and the Luqia is probably       the most important stream in this region, the Sheikhan-Su,       which waters Savur, chief town of the caza of Avinch. Ardupa       must have been situated near, or on the actual site of, the       present Mardin, whose Assyrian name is unknown to us; it was       at all events a military station on the road to Nineveh,       along which the king returned victorious with the spoil.    At Ardupa a brief halt was made to receive the ambassadors of one of the  Hittite sovereigns and others from the kings of Khanigalbat, after which  he returned to Nineveh, where he spent the winter. As a matter of fact,  these were but petty wars, and their immediate results appear at the  first glance quite inadequate to account for the contemporary enthusiasm  they excited. The sincerity of it can be better understood when we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17328"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 8 (of 12) (#5)"],[1,"of  shepherds be called forth against him, he will not be dismayed at their  voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the Lord of  hosts come down to fight upon Mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof.  As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem: He will  protect and deliver it. Turn ye unto Him from whom ye have deeply  revolted, O children of Israel.\"**         * Isa. xxx. 1-5, 7. In verses 4, 5, the original text       employs the third person; I have restored the second person,       to avoid confusion.         ** Isa. xxxi. 3-6.    No one, however, gave heed to his warnings, either king or people; but  the example of Phoenicia soon proved that he was right. When Sennacherib  bestirred himself, in the spring of 702 B.C., either the Ethiopians were  not ready, or they dared not advance to encounter him in Coele-Syria,  and they left Elulai to get out of his difficulties as best he might.  He had no army to risk in a pitched battle; but fondly imagined that his  cities, long since fortified, and protected on the east by the range of  Lebanon, would offer a resistance sufficiently stubborn to wear out  the patience of his assailant. The Assyrians, however, disconcerted his  plans. Instead of advancing against him by the pass of Nahr-el-Kebir,  according to their usual custom, they attacked him in flank, descending  into the very midst of his positions by the _col_ of Legnia or one of  the neighbouring passes.* They captured in succession the two Sidons,  Bit-ziti, Sarepta, Mahalliba, Ushu, Akzib, and Acco: Elulai, reduced  to the possession of the island of Tyre alone, retreated to one of his  colonies in Cyprus, where he died some years later, without having set  foot again on the continent. All his former possessions on the mainland  were given to a certain Eth-baal, who chose Sidon for his seat of  government, and Tyre lost by this one skirmish the rank of metropolis  which she had enjoyed for centuries.** This summary punishment decided  all the Syrian princes who were not compromised beyond hope of pardon to  humble themselves before the suzerain. Menahem of Samsi-muruna,***         * This follows from the very order in which the cities were       taken in the course of this campaign.         ** The Assyrian text gives for the name of the King of Sidon       a shortened form Tu-baal instead of Eth-baal, paralleled by       Lulia for Elulai.         *** Several of the early Assyriologists read Usi-muruna, and       identified the city bearing this name with Samaria. The       discovery of the reading Samsi-muruna on a fragment of the       time of Assur-bani-pal no longer permits of this       identification, and obliges us to look for the city in       Phoenicia.    Abdiliti of Arvad, Uru-malik of Byblos, Puduilu of Amnion, Chemosh-nadab  of Moab, Malik-rammu of Edom, Mitinti of Ashdod, all brought their  tribute in person to the Assyrian camp before Ushu: Zedekiah of Ashkelon  and Hezekiah of Judah alone persisted in their hostility. Egypt had at  length been moved by the misfortunes of her allies, and the Ethiopian  troops had advanced to the seat of war, but they did not arrive in time  to save Zedekiah: Sennacherib razed to the ground all his strongholds  one after another, Beth-dagon, Joppa, Bene-berak, and Hazor,* took him  prisoner at Ascalon, and sent him with his family to Assyria, setting  up Sharludari, son of Bukibti, in his stead. Sennacherib then turned  against Ekron, and was about to begin the siege of the city, when the  long-expected Egyptians at length made their appearance. Shabitoku  did not command them in person, but he had sent his best troops--the  contingents furnished by the petty kings of the Delta, and the sheikhs  of the Sinaitic peninsula, who were vassals of Egypt. The encounter  took place near Altaku,** and on this occasion again, as at Raphia,  the scientific tactics of the Assyrians prevailed over the stereotyped  organisation of Pharaoh's army: the Ethiopian generals left some of  their chariots in the hands of the conqueror, and retreated with the  remnants of their force beyond the Isthmus.         * These are the cities attributed to the tribes of Dan and       Judah in Josh. xv. 25, 41; xix. 45. Beth-dagon is now Bet-       Dejan; Azuru is Yazur, to the south-east of Joppa; Beni-       barak is Ibn-Abrak, to the north-east of the same town.         ** Altaku is certainly Eltekeh of Dan (Josh. xix. 44), as       was seen from the outset; the site, however, of Eltekeh       cannot be fixed with any certainty. It has been located at       Bet-Lukkieh, in the mountainous country north-west of       Jerusalem, but this position in no way corresponds to the       requirements of the Assyrian text, according to which the       battle took place on a plain large enough for the evolutions       of the Egyptian chariots, and situated between the group of       towns formed by Beth-dagon, Joppa, Beni-barak, and Hazor,       which Sennacherib had just captured, and the cities of       Ekrbn, Timnath, and Eltekeh, which he took directly after       his victory: a suitable locality must be looked for in the       vicinity of Ramleh or Zernuka.    Altaku capitulated, an example followed by the neighbouring fortress of  Timnath, and subsequently by Ekron itself, all three being made to feel  Sennacherib's vengeance. \"The nobles and chiefs who had offended, I  slew,\" he remarks, \"and set up their corpses on stakes in a circle  round the city; those of the inhabitants who had offended and committed  crimes, I took them prisoners, and for the rest who had neither offended  nor transgressed, I pardoned them.\"      [Illustration: 028.jpg THE PASS OF LEGNIA, IN LEBANON]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph given in Lortet.    [Illustration: 028b.jpg Esneh--Principal Abyssinian Trading Village]    We may here pause to inquire how Hezekiah was occupied while his fate  was being decided on the field of Altaku. He was fortifying Jerusalem,  and storing within it munitions of War, and enrolling Jewish soldiers  and mercenary troops from the Arab tribes of the desert. He had suddenly  become aware that large portions of the wall of the city of David had  crumbled away, and he set about demolishing the neighbouring houses to  obtain materials for repairing these breaches: he hastily strengthened  the weak points in his fortifications, stopped up the springs which  flowed into the Gibon, and cut off the brook itself, constructing a  reservoir between the inner and outer city walls to store up the waters  of the ancient pool. These alterations* rendered the city, which from  its natural position was well defended, so impregnable that Sennacherib  decided not to attack it until the rest of the kingdom had been  subjugated: with this object in view he pitched his camp before Lachish,  whence he could keep a watch over the main routes from Egypt where they  crossed the frontier, and then scattered his forces over the land of  Judah, delivering it up to pillage in a systematic manner. He took  forty-six walled towns, and numberless strongholds and villages,  demolishing the walls and leading into captivity 200,150 persons of all  ages and conditions, together with their household goods, their horses,  asses, mules, camels, oxen, and sheep;** it was a war as disastrous in  its effects as that which terminated in the fall of Samaria, or which  led to the final captivity in Babylon.***         * Isa. xxii. 8-11.         * An allusion to the sojourn of Sennacherib near Lachish is       found in 2 Kings xviii. 14-17; xix. 8, and in Isa. xxxvi. 2;       xxxvii. 8         *** It seems that the Jewish historian Demetrios considered       the captivities under Nebuchadrezzar and Sennacherib to be       on the same footing.    The work of destruction accomplished, the Rabshakeh brought up all his  forces and threw up a complete circle of earthworks round Jerusalem:  Hezekiah found himself shut up in his capital \"like a bird in a cage.\"  The inhabitants soon became accustomed to this isolated life, but  Isaiah was indignant at seeing them indifferent to their calamities, and  inveighed against them with angry eloquence: \"What aileth thee now,  that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops? O thou that art full of  shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; thy slain are not slain  with the sword, neither are they dead in battle. All thy rulers fled  away together, they are made prisoners without drawing the bow; they are  come hither from afar for safety, and all that meet together here shall  be taken together.\"*         * [The R.V. gives this passage as follows: \"They were bound       by the archers: all that were found of thee were bound       together, they fled afar off.\"--TR.]    The danger was urgent; the Assyrians were massed in their entrenchments  with their auxiliaries ranged behind them to support them: \"Elam bare  the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the  shield (for the assault). And it came to pass that thy choicest valleys  were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at thy  gate, and he took away the covering of Judah.\"    [Illustration: 029.jpg SENNACHERIB RECEIVING THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE  JEWS]    In those days, therefore, Jahveh, without pity for His people, called  them to \"weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with  sackcloth: and behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep,  eating flesh and drinking wine: let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we  shall die. And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in mine ears, Surely  this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the  Lord, the Lord of Hosts.\"* The prophet threw the blame on the courtiers  especially Shebna, who still hoped for succour from the Egyptians, and  kept up the king's illusions on this point. He threatened him with the  divine anger; he depicted him as seized by Jahveh, rolled and"]]]
