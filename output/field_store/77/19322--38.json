He therefore resolved on sending       an expedition into the country, in order to recover his       property.         The day before the party set off, I arrived accidentally at the       house, taking a survey of numerous bodies of woodcutters       belonging to the establishment with which I was connected. The       only time anyone can penetrate into the interior in the winter       season, the lakes and rivers being frozen over; even the Bay of       Exploits, though salt water, was then (the end of January)       frozen for sixty miles. Having proposed to accompany the party,       they immediately consented. Our equipments consisted of a       musket, bayonet, and hatchet; to each of the servants a pistol;       Mr. ---- and myself had, in addition, another pistol and a       dagger, and a double-barrelled gun, instead of a musket: each       carried a pair of snowshoes, a supply of eight pounds of       biscuit and a piece of pork, ammunition, and one quart of rum;       besides, we had a light sled and four dogs, who took it in       turns in dragging the sled, which contained a blanket for each       man, rum and other necessaries. We depended on our guns for a       supply of provisions, and at all times could meet with plenty       of partridges and hares, though there were few days we did not       kill a deer. The description of one day's journey will suffice       for all, there being but little variation. The snow was at this       time about eight feet deep.         On the morning of our departure we set off in good spirits up       the river, and after following its course for about twelve       miles, arrived at the Rapids, a deer at full speed passed us; I       fired, and it fell; the next instant a wolf, in full pursuit,       made his appearance; on seeing the party, he halted for an       instant, and then rushed forward as if to attack us. Mr. ----       however, anticipated him; for taking a steady aim, at the same       time sitting coolly on an old tree, he passed a bullet through       the fellow's head, who was soon stretched a corpse on the snow;       a few minutes after another appeared, when several firing       together he also fell, roaring and howling for a long time,       when one of the men went and knocked him on the head with a       hatchet.         And now, ye effeminate feather bed loungers, where do you       suppose we were to sleep? There was no comfortable hotel to       receive us; not even a house where a board informs the       benighted traveller that there is \"entertainment for man and       horse;\" not even the skeleton of a wigwam; the snow eight feet       deep,--the thermometer nineteen degrees below the freezing       point. Every one having disencumbered himself of his load,       proceeded with his hatchet to cut down the small fir and birch       trees. The thick part of the trees was cut in lengths, and       heaped up in two piles; between which a sort of wigwam was       formed of the branches: a number of small twigs of trees, to       the depth of about three feet, were laid on the snow for a bed;       and having lighted the pile of wood on each side, some       prepared venison steaks for supper, while others skinned the       two wolves, in order, with the dear skin, to form a covering to       the wigwam; this some opposed, as being a luxury we should not       every day obtain. Supper being ready, we ate heartily, and       having melted some snow for water, we made some hot toddy, that       is, rum, butter, hot water and sugar; a song was proposed, and       acceeded to: and thus, in the midst of a dreary desert, far       from the voice of our fellow men, we sat cheerful and       contented, looking forward for the morrow, without dread,       anxious to renew our toils and resume our labours. Alter about       an hour thus spent the watch was appointed, and each wrapped in       his blanket. We vied unconvincing each other, with the nasal       organ, which was in the soundest sleep; mine was the last       watch, about an hour before daybreak. The Aurora Borealis       rolled in awful splendour across the deep blue sky, but I will       not tire my readers with a description. When the first glimpse       of morn showed itself in the light clouds floating in the       eastern horison, I awoke my companions; and by the time it was       sufficiently light we had breakfasted, and were ready to       proceed. Cutting off enough of the deer shot the night before,       we proceeded on our journey, leaving the rest to the wolves.       Each day and each night was a repetition of the same; the       country being in some places tolerably level, in general       covered with wood, but occasionally barren tracts, where       sometimes for miles not a tree was to be seen.         Mr. ---- instructing the men in which way he wished them to       act, informing them that his object was to open a friendly       communication with the Indians, rather than act on the       principle of intimidating them by revenge; that if they avoided       him, he should endeavour to take one or more prisoners and       bring them with him, in order that by the civilization of one       or two, an intercourse might be established that would end in       their permanent civilization. He strictly exhorted them not to       use undue violence: every one was strictly enjoined not to       _fire_ on any account. About three o'clock in the afternoon the       two men who then led the party were about two hundred yards       before the rest;--three deer closely followed by a pack of       wolves, issued from the wood on the left, and bounded across       the lake, passing very near the men, whom they totally       disregarded. The men incautiously fired at them. We were then       about half a mile from the point of land that almost       intersected the lake, and in a few minutes we saw it covered       with Indians, who instantly retired.[B] The alarm was given; we       soon reached the point; about five Hundred yards on the other       side we saw the Indian houses, and the Indians, men, women, and       children, rushing from them, across the lake, hereabout a mile       broad. Hurrying on we quickly came to the houses; when within a       shirt distance from the last house, three men and a woman       carrying a child, issued forth. One of the men took the infant       from her, and their speed soon convinced us of the futility of       pursuit; the woman, however, did not run so fast. Mr. ----       loosened his provision bag from his back and let it fall, threw       away his gun and hatchet, and set off at a speed that soon       overtook the woman. One man and myself did the same, except our       guns. The rest, picking up our things, followed. On overtaking       the woman, she instantly fell on her kness, and tearing open       the cassock, (a dress composed of deerskin lined with fur,)       showing her breasts to prove that she was a woman, and begged       for mercy. In a few moments we were by Mr. ----'s side. Several       of the Indians, with the three who had quitted the house with       the woman, now advanced, while we retreated towards the shore.       At length we stopped and they did the same. After a pause,       three of them laid down their bows, with which they were armed,       and came within two hundred yards. We then presented our guns,       intimating that not more than one would be allowed to approach.       They retired and fetched their arms, when one, the ill-fated       husband of Mary March, our captive, advanced with a branch of       fir tree (spruce) in his hand. When about ten yards off he       stopped and made a long oration. He spoke at least ten minutes;       towards the last his gesture became very animated, and his eye       \"shot fire.\" He concluded very mildly, and advancing, shook       hands with many of the party--then he attempted to take his       wife from us; being opposed in this he drew from beneath his       cassock an axe, the whole of which was finely polished, and       brandished it over our heads. On two or three pieces being       presented, he gave it up to Mr. ----, who then intimated that       the woman must go with us, but that he might go also if he       pleased, and that in the morning both should have their       liberty. At the same time two of the men began to conduct her       towards the houses. On this being done, he became infuriated,       and rushing towards her strove to drag her from them; one of       the men rushed forward and stabbed him in the back with a       bayonte: turning round, at a blow he laid the fellow at his       feet; the next instant he knocked down another, and rushing on       ----, like a child laid him on his back, and seizing his dirk       from his belt brandished it over his head; the next instant it       would have been buried in him, had I not with both hands       seized his arm; he shook me off in an instant, while I       measured my length on the ice; Mr. ---- then drew a pistol from       his girdle and fired. The poor wretch first staggered, then       fell on his face; while writhing in agonies, he seemed for a       moment to stop; his muscles stiffened: slowly and gradually he       raised himself from the ice, turned round, and with a wild gaze       surveyed us all in a circle around him. Never shall I forget       the figure he exhibited; his hair hanging on each side of his       sallow face; his bushy beard clotted with blood that flowed       from his mouth and nose; his eyes flashing fire, yet with the       glass of death upon them,--they fixed on the individual that       first stabbed him. Slowly he raised the hand that still grasped       young ----'s dagger, till he raised it considerably above his       head, when uttering a yell that made the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15127"],[0,"Pitman's Commercial Spanish Grammar (2nd ed.)

Su mujer es menos rica que el: His wife is less rich than he.  Soy tan feliz como V.: I am as happy as you.  No es tan amable como su primo: He is not so amiable as his cousin.      _Superlative Absolute_.    EXAMPLES--    Muy largo: Very long. Muy corto: Very short.    Another way to form the Superlative Absolute[39] is by adding =isimo=  instead of using _muy_. If the adjective ends in a vowel, this is elided  before adding _isimo_.    [Footnote 39: More rarely used and much more emphatic.]    EXAMPLES--    Estas frutas son muy maduras: These fruits are very ripe.  Estas frutas son madurisimas: These fruits are very ripe indeed.  Estos tenderos son muy ricos: These shopkeepers are very rich.  Aquellos son riquisimos: Those (others) are very rich indeed.    Before adding _isimo_, adjectives ending in    _ble_ change it into =bil=, as Amable, amabilisimo.  _co_ \" \" =qu=, as Rico, riquisimo.  _go_ \" \" =gu=, as Largo, larguisimo.    Adjectives of more than three syllables ending in _ble_, adjectives  ending in two vowels, or in one vowel accented, should always take =muy=  and not add _isimo_ for the Superlative Absolute.    Besides the regular forms of the Comparative and Superlative degrees,  there are the following irregular forms--    Mejor (better). Optimo (very  good or best). Peor (worse). Pesimo (very bad or worst). Mayor (larger).  Maximo (very large or largest). Menor (smaller). Minimo (very small or  smallest). Superior (higher). Supremo (very high or highest). Inferior  (lower). Infimo (very low or lowest).    +--------------------------------------------------------------------+  |                    _Future Tense,[40] Indic.
