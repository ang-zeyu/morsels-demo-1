If the traveller have time, it  is worth while to mount a tower, at the top of which is a sort of  lantern capable of containing about a dozen persons, and commanding a  most extensive view over the sea, and on the opposite side the country  is visible for a considerable distance, bearing a most uninviting  appearance. There are a great number of hotels at Calais, and I have  been at many of them, but have found that kept by M. Derhorter, called  the Hotel Bourbon, the most comfortable and economical, and the civility  of the master cannot anywhere be surpassed. Dessin's, for the nobility  and those who have equipages, is still the favourite and has been for  time immemorial.    Nothing worthy of note presents itself between Calais and Boulogne,  except the little village of Wimille, which made some impression upon my  mind, as being so much prettier and so much more village-like than any  other through which we had passed, and near here perished the  unfortunate aeronauts Pilatre and Romain, falling from their balloon when  at a prodigious height from the ground and in sight of many spectators.  They were buried in the churchyard, in which a monument has been erected  commemorative of the event. About two miles from this hamlet Boulogne  appears in sight, cheering the spectator by its gay and animated aspect,  the numerous groups of genteel-looking persons constantly promenading  the streets, pier and port, give it a most lively appearance, which is  enhanced by the extreme cleanliness which is observed in all the  principal streets, and the cheerful air afforded by the white stone  houses with their green balconies and shutters. But the numerously  well-dressed portion of the population, which so greatly contribute  towards enlivening the scene, consists almost wholly of English, as the  few French families which still reside in Boulogne, above the rank of  the tradespeople, keep themselves very close and retired as in all other  provincial towns in France; and in Boulogne they are very suspicious of  the English, having had such numbers of bad characters who at first  preserved a very respectable appearance but ultimately proved to be  swindlers. The higher French families, therefore, decline any  association with the English, unless with persons who have come  highly-recommended, or have resided many years in the town with an  unimpeachable character. It so happened that circumstances brought me in  contact with two or three of these exclusive personages, and their  remarks about the English afforded me much amusement, and may be taken  as types of the general observations of the provincial French upon our  country-people.    The worthy matrons of families have often said to me, \"How is it, Sir,  that the wives and mothers of your country can manage their domestic  concerns, when they are seen almost continually walking about the  streets at hours when we find it indispensable to attend to our  household affairs.\"    I replied, that after having given their orders they relied in a great  degree upon their servants executing them with punctuality.    \"Indeed!\" was the exclamation; \"how fortunate they must be to have such  immaculate servants that they can so entirely depend upon them: we  should be very happy if we could have such as did not require looking  after, but unfortunately French servants partake too much of human  nature for mistresses to be able to leave them wholly to themselves.\"    I observed that perhaps English servants generally being more humble,  obedient, and subservient to their superiors, greater reliance might be  placed upon them, and undoubtedly more certainty as to their obeying the  instructions they received.    \"Then it is surprising,\" said the ladies, \"that your country people do  not always bring servants with them, and very unlucky that in so many  instances when they have done so, that their domestics should so often  be brought before the Tribunals of Correction for different  irregularities.\"    I replied, that many good and regular servants did not like to quit  their native land, and of those who were brought over, certainly in many  instances their employers had been disappointed; that in a foreign  country all was new to them, and they forgot their former regular  habits, and certainly in too many instances had misbehaved themselves.    \"Consequently,\" returned my interlocutors, \"requiring a more vigilant  eye to superintend them. But there is another subject which affords us  much surprise, and that is the manner in which English parents permit  their daughters to go alone about the streets, or to walk with a  gentleman who is neither their father nor brother.\"    I assigned as a reason for our allowing them so much liberty, that we  had such perfect confidence in them that we felt assured we could trust  to their own firmness and discretion to prevent any improper  consequences arising from the freedom they were permitted to enjoy.  \"Unfortunately, that confidence is but too frequently abused,\" rejoined  one of the ladies, \"if we are to judge from several lamentable  occurrences which have latterly taken place in this town amongst the  English young ladies.\"    I felt the rebuke, as I knew to what circumstances they alluded, and  observed that the English society inhabiting Boulogne were by no means  what could, be termed the _elite_ of the nation, although there were  many families of the highest respectability.    The ladies, perceiving by my manner that I was somewhat nettled,  endeavoured to soften what they had said, by observing that certainly it  would not be just to estimate the English people by the samples which  came to reside at Boulogne, as they had generally understood that they  were persons of indifferent reputation, who fled from their own country  because they could no longer live there in credit, but that amongst the  number there undoubtedly were some very quiet people.    A stranger would not appreciate the degree of praise which is contained  in the word quiet when used by the French, who appear to consider it as  comprising all the cardinal virtues; when seeking a house or apartments,  if you say any thing favourable or unfavourable of them, they never fail  to remind you that they are so quiet. The same eulogy they will  pronounce on their daughters with peculiar pride and energy, when they  wish to extol them to the skies, and in good truth their _demoiselles_  are quiet enough in all conscience, for it requires often a  considerable degree of ingenuity to extract from them more than  monosyllables. We have been accustomed to consider the French as a  restless, capricious, volatile people, and so I suppose they might have  been formerly, but now they are undoubtedly the reverse, being a quiet  routine plodding sort of people, particularly as regards the  provincials; and even amongst the Parisians there are thousands that  reside in one quarter of the city, which they seldom quit, never  approaching what they consider the gay portion of Paris, but live  amongst each other, visiting only within their own circle, consisting  almost entirely of their relations and family connexions. This feeling  is certainly exemplified still farther at Boulogne, as I knew an old  couple who lived in the upper town, which joins the lower town except by  the separation of the wall of the fortifications, and had not been in  the latter for five years, because they considered it was too bustling  and too much a place of pleasure for such quiet, homely, and orderly  folk as they professed to be and certainly were, in every sense of the  word. At Bordeaux I knew three old ladies who were born in that city,  and never had been in any other town during their whole lives, nor ever  desired to pass the walls of their native place. Many persons who have  been accustomed to spend their days in the provinces have a sort of  horror of Paris; I remember an old gentleman at Rouen, who with his  antiquated spouse lived a sort of Darby and Joan kind of life, their  only daughter being married and living elsewhere; and on my once asking  him if he had ever been to Paris, he replied that he was once so  situated as to be compelled to go upon urgent business that rendered his  presence indispensable, but that he saw very little of the place,  because he had always heard that it was a city replete with vice and  dissipation, and that during the few days his affairs compelled him to  stay he kept close to his apartment, only quitting it to proceed to the  house wherein he had to transact business, and then he went in a  _fiacre_, as, if he had walked perhaps he might have been jostled, run  over, robbed, or something unpleasant might have occurred. \"Ah! that's  very true, you did quite right, and acted very prudently, my dear,\"  observed his wife, \"and nobody knows the anxiety I felt till you came  back again.\" Although the rising generation of the French is not quite  so dormant in their ideas as that which is passing, yet there is not  even with them the same spirit of travel and enterprise which exist in  the English. That France has had, a reputation for restlessness, love of  change, and tumult, can only be explained by stating that until the  present time for the last two centuries, with the exception of Louis the  Eighteenth, she has been most unfortunate in her rulers, who have been  supporting a state of extravagant splendour which could alone be  sustained by being wrung from the middle and the lower classes; hence  the revolution in 1789, which might be considered as the ripened fruit  which the preceding reigns had been nurturing. Of the affair of the  three days in 1830, few I believe will deny the intensity of the  provocation, but then it will be said how do you account for their  having been so turbulent and discontented during the present reign? To  which I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#5)"],[1,"glance up and down the gallery and over into the court. Still no spying  eye, save that of the officer opposite.    \"We will leave that bow where it is for the present,\" he decided, \"a  secret between us three.\" And motioning for Correy to let the tapestry  fall, he stood watching it settle into place, till it hung quite straight  again, with its one edge close to the wall and the other sweeping the  floor. Had its weight been great enough to push the bow back again into  its former place close against the door? Yes. No eye, however trained,  would, from any bulge in the heavy tapestry, detect its presence there.  He could leave the spot without fear; their secret would remain theirs  until such time as they chose to disclose it.    As the three walked back the way they had come, the Curator glanced  earnestly at the detective, who seemed to have fallen into a kind of  anxious dream. Would it do to interrupt him with questions? Would he  obtain a straight answer if he did? The old man moved heavily but the now  fully alert Curator could not fail to see that it was with the heaviness  of absorbed thought. Dare he disturb that thought? They had both reached  the broad corridor separating the two galleries at the western end before  he ventured to remark:    \"This discovery alters matters, does it not? May I ask what you propose  to do now? Anything in which we can help you?\"    [Illustration:  1--Ephraim Short.  2--Mrs. Lynch.  3--Director Roberts.  4--Door-man.  5--Copyist.  6--Mrs. Alice Lee.  7-8--Mr. and Mrs. Draper.  9--Mr. Coit.  10--Mr. Simpson.  11--Prof. Turnbull.  12--Second Door-man.  13--Miss Hunsicker.  14--Attendant.  15--Miss Blake.  16--Officer.]    The detective may have heard him and he may not; at all events he made no  reply though he continued to advance with a mechanical step until he  stood again at the top of the marble steps leading down into the court.  Here some of the uncertainty pervading his mind seemed to leave him,  though he still looked very old and very troubled, or so the Curator  thought, as pausing there, he allowed his glance to wander from the  marble recesses below to the galleries on either side of him, and from  these on to the seemingly empty spaces back of the high, carved railing  guarding the great well. Would a younger man have served them better? It  began to look so; then without warning and in a flash, as it were, the  whole appearance of the octogenarian detective changed, and turning with  a smile to the two men so anxiously watching him, he exclaimed with an  air of quiet triumph:    \"I have it. Follow and see how my plan works.\"    Amazed, for he looked and moved like another man,--a man in whom the  almost extinguished spark of early genius had suddenly flared again into  full blaze,--they hastily joined him in anticipation of they knew not  what. But their enthusiasm received a check when at the moment of descent  Mr. Gryce again turned back with the remark:    \"I had forgotten. I have something to do first. If you will kindly see  that the people down there are kept from growing too impatient, I will  soon join you with Mrs. Taylor, who must not be left on this floor after  we have gone below.\"    And with no further explanation of his purpose, he turned and proceeded  without delay to Room B.          IV    A STRATEGIC MOVE      He found the unhappy woman quite recovered from her fainting spell, but  still greatly depressed and not a little incoherent. He set himself to  work to soothe her, for he had a request to make which called for an  intelligent answer. Relieved from all suspicion of her having been an  active agent in the deplorable deed he was here to investigate, he was  lavish in his promises of speedy release, and seeing how much this  steadied her, he turned to Mr. Roberts, who was still in the room, and  then to the young lady who had been giving her a woman's care, and  signified that their attentions were no longer required and that he would  be glad to have them join the people below.    When the door had closed and Mr. Gryce found himself for the first time  alone with Mrs. Taylor, he drew up a chair to her side and remarked in  his old benevolent way:    \"I feel guilty of cruelty, madam, in repeating a question you have  already answered. But the conditions are such that I must, and do it now.  When this young lady fell so unexpectedly at your feet, was your first  look at her or at the opposite gallery?\"    For an instant her eyes held his--something which did not often happen to  him.    \"At her,\" she vehemently declared. \"I never thought of looking anywhere  else. I saw her at my feet, and fell on my knees at her side. Who  wouldn't have done so! Who would have seen anything but that arrow--_that  arrow_! Oh, it was terrible! Do not make me recall it. I have sorrows  enough----\"    \"Mrs. Taylor, you have my utmost sympathy. But you must realize how  important it is for me to make sure that you saw nothing in the place  from which that arrow was sent which would help us to locate the author  of this accident. The flitting of an escaping figure up or down the  opposite gallery, even a stir in the great tapestry confronting you from  that far-away wall, might give us a clue.\"    \"I saw nothing,\" she replied coldly but with extreme firmness, \"nothing  but that lifeless child and the picture of desolation which rose in my  own mind. Do not, I pray, make me speak again of that. It would sound  like delirium, and it is my wish to impress you with my sanity, so that  you will allow me to go home.\"    \"You shall go, after the Coroner has had an opportunity to see you. We  expect him any moment. Meanwhile, you will facilitate your release and  greatly help us in what we have to do, if you will carry your fortitude  to the point of showing me in your own person just where you were  standing when this young girl dashed by you to her death.\"    \"Do you mean for me to go back to that--that----\"    \"Yes, Mrs. Taylor. Surely you can do so if you will. When you have time  to think, you will be as anxious as ourselves to know through whose  carelessness (to call it nothing worse) this child came to her death.  Though it may prove to be quite immaterial whether you stood in one place  or another at that fatal moment, it is a question which will be sure to  come up at the inquest. That you may be able to answer correctly I urge  you to return with me to the exact spot, before your recollection of the  same has had time to fade. After that we will go below and I will see  that you are taken to some quiet place where you can remain undisturbed  till the Coroner comes.\"    Had she been a weak woman she would have succumbed again at this. But  she was a strong one, and after the first moment of recoil she rose  tremulously to her feet and signified her willingness to follow him to  the scene of death.    \"Is--is she there alone?\" was her sole question as they crossed the  corridor separating the room they had been in from the galleries.    \"No--you will find an officer there. We could not leave the place quite  unguarded.\"    If she shuddered he did not observe it. Having summoned up all her  forces to meet this ordeal, she followed him without further word, and  re-entering the spot she had so lately left in great agony of mind,  stopped for one look and for one look only at the sweet face of the dead  girl smiling up at her from the cold floor, then she showed Mr. Gryce as  nearly as she could just where she had paused in shock and horror when  the poor child smitten by the fatal arrow fell back almost into her arms.    The detective, with a glance at the opposite gallery, turned and spoke to  the officer who had stepped aside into the neighboring section.    \"Take the place just occupied by this lady,\" he said, \"and hold it till  you hear from me again.\" Then offering his arm to Mrs. Taylor, he led her  out.    \"I see that you were approaching the railing overlooking the court when  you were stopped in this fearful manner,\" he remarked when well down the  gallery toward its lower exit. \"What did you have in mind? A nearer  glimpse of the tapestry over there and the two great vases?\"    \"No, no.\" She was wrought up by now to a tension almost unendurable. \"It  was the court--what I might see in the court. Oh!\" she impulsively cried:  \"the child! the child! that innocent, beautiful child!\" And breaking away  from his arm, she threw herself against the wall in a burst of  uncontrollable weeping.    He allowed her a moment of unrestrained grief, then he took her on his  arm again and led her down into the court where he gave her into the  charge of Correy. He had gone as far as he dared in her present  hysterical condition. Besides, he could no longer defer the great  experiment by means of which he hoped to reach the heart of this mystery.    Taking the slip of paper handed him by Sweetwater, he crossed the court  to where the various visitors, detained, some against their will and some  quite in accordance with it, stood about in groups or sat side by side on  the long benches placed along the front for their comfort. As he  confronted them, his face beamed with that benevolent smile which had  done so much for him in days gone by. Raising his hand he called  attention to himself; then, when he was quite sure of being heard by them  all, he addressed them with a quiet emphasis which could not fail to gain  and hold their attention:    \"I am Detective Gryce, sent here from Police Headquarters to look into  this very serious matter. Till the Coroner arrives, I am in authority  here, and being so, will have to ask your indulgence for any discomfort  you may experience in helping me with my investigation. A young girl,  full of life an hour ago, lies dead in the gallery above. We do not know  her name; we do not know who killed her. But there is some one here who  does.
