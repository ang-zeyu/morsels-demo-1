To the overwrought nerves of many  a Puritan woman, taught to believe meekly the doctrines of her father,  and weakened in body by ceaseless childbearing and unending toil, such a  picture must indeed have been terrifying. And the God that she and her  husband heard described Sabbath after Sabbath was not only heartily  willing to condemn man to eternal torment but capable of enjoying the  tortures of the damned, and gloating in strange joy over the writhings  of the condemned. Is it any wonder that in the midst of Jonathan  Edward's sermon, _Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God_, men and women  sprang to their feet and shrieked in anguish, \"What shall we do to be  saved?\"    \"The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a  spider, or some loathsome insect, over the fire, abhors you and is  dreadfully provoked; his wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks  upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire; he is  of purer eyes than to bear to have you in his sight; you are ten  thousand times as abominable in his eyes, as the most hateful and  venomous serpent is in ours. You have offended him infinitely more than  ever a stubborn rebel did his prince; and yet it is nothing but his hand  that holds you from falling into the fire every moment; it is ascribed  to nothing else that you did not go to hell the last night; that you was  suffered to awake again in this world, after you closed your eyes to  sleep; and there is no other reason to be given why you have not dropped  into hell since you arose in the morning, but that God's hand has held  you up; there is no other reason to be given why you have not gone to  hell, since you have sat here in the house of God, provoking his pure  eyes by your sinful wicked manner of attending his solemn worship: yea,  there is nothing else that is to be given as a reason why you do not  this very moment drop down into hell.\"    Under such teachings the girl of colonial New England grew into  womanhood; with such thoughts in mind she saw her children go down into  the grave; with such forebodings she herself passed out into an  uncertain Hereafter. Nor was there any escape from such sermons; for  church attendance was for many years compulsory, and even when not  compulsory, was essential for those who did not wish to be politically  and socially ostracized. The preachers were not, of course, required to  give proof for their declarations; they might well have announced, \"Thus  saith the Lord,\" but they preferred to enter into disquisitions  bristling with arguments and so-called logical deductions. For instance,  note in Edwards' sermon, _Why Saints in Glory will Rejoice to see the  Torments of the Damned_, the chain of reasoning leading to the  conclusion that those enthroned in heaven shall find joy in the unending  torture of their less fortunate neighbors:    \"They will rejoice in seeing the _justice_ of God glorified in the  sufferings of the damned. The misery of the damned, dreadful as it is,  is but what justice requires. They in heaven will see and know it much  more clearly than any of us do here. They will see how perfectly just  and righteous their punishment is and therefore how properly inflicted  by the supreme Governor of the world.... They will rejoice when they see  him who is their Father and eternal portion so glorious in his justice.  The sight of this strict and immutable justice of God will render him  amiable and adorable in their eyes. It will occasion rejoicing in them,  as they will have the greater sense of _their own happiness_, by seeing  the contrary misery. It is the nature of pleasure and pain, of happiness  and misery, greatly to heighten the sense of each other.... When they  shall see how miserable others of their fellow-creatures are, who were  naturally in the same circumstances with themselves; when they shall see  the smoke of their torment, and the raging of the flames of their  burning, and hear their dolorous shrieks and cries, and consider that  they in the meantime are in the most blissful state, and shall surely be  in it to all eternity; how will they rejoice!... When they shall see the  dreadful miseries of the damned, and consider that they deserved the  same misery, and that it was sovereign grace, and nothing else, which  made them so much to differ from the damned, that if it had not been for  that, they would have been in the same condition; but that God from all  eternity was pleased to set his love upon them, that Christ hath laid  down his life for them, and hath made them thus gloriously happy  forever, O how will they adore that dying love of Christ, which has  redeemed them from so great a misery, and purchased for them so great  happiness, and has so distinguished them from others of their  fellow-creatures!\"    It was a strange creed that led men to teach such theories. And when we  learn that Jonathan Edwards was a man of singular gentleness and  kind-heartedness, we realize that it must have tortured him to preach  such doctrines, but that he believed it his sacred duty to do so.    The religion, however, that the Puritan woman imbibed from girlhood to  old age went further than this; it taught the theory of a personal  devil. To the New England colonists Satan was a very real individual  capable of taking to himself a physical form with the proverbial tail,  horns, and hoofs. Hear what Cotton Mather, one of the most eminent  divines of early Massachusetts, has to say in his _Memorable  Providences_ about this highly personal Satan: \"There is both a God and  a Devil and Witchcraft: That there is no out-ward Affliction, but what  God may (and sometimes doth) permit Satan to trouble his people withal:  That the Malice of Satan and his Instruments, is very great against the  Children of God: That the clearest Gospel-Light shining in a place, will  not keep some from entering hellish Contracts with infernal Spirits:  That Prayer is a powerful and effectual Remedy against the malicious  practices of Devils and those in Covenant with them.\"[8]    And His Satanic Majesty had legions of followers, equally insistent on  tormenting humanity. In _The Wonders of the Invisible World_, published  in 1692, Mather proves that there is a devil and that the being has  specific attributes, powers, and limitations:         \"A devil is a fallen angel, an angel fallen from the fear and       love of God, and from all celestial glories; but fallen to all       manner of wretchedness and cursedness.... There are multitudes,       multitudes, in the valley of destruction, where the devils are!       When we speak of the devil, 'tis a name of multitude.... The       devils they swarm about us, like the frogs of Egypt, in the most       retired of our chambers. Are we at our boards? beds? There will       be devils to tempt us into carnality. Are we in our shops? There       will be devils to tempt us into dishonesty. Yea, though we get       into the church of God, there will be devils to haunt us in the       very temple itself, and there tempt us to manifold misbehaviors.       I am verily persuaded that there are very few human affairs       whereinto some devils are not insinuated. There is not so much as       a journey intended, but Satan will have an hand in hindering or       furthering of it.\"         \"...'Tis to be supposed, that there is a sort of arbitrary, even       military government, among the devils.... These devils have a       prince over them, who is king over the children of pride. 'Tis       probable that the devil, who was the ringleader of that mutinous       and rebellious crew which first shook off the authority of God,       is now the general of those hellish armies; our Lord that       conquered him has told us the name of him; 'tis Belzebub; 'tis he       that is the devil and the rest are his angels, or his       soldiers.... 'Tis to be supposed that some devils are more       peculiarly commission'd, and perhaps qualify'd, for some       countries, while others are for others.... It is not likely that       every devil does know every language; or that every devil can do       every mischief. 'Tis possible that the experience, or, if I may       call it so, the education of all devils is not alike, and that       there may be some difference in their abilities....\"    What was naturally the effect of such a faith upon the sensitive nerves  of the women "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#5)"],[1,"to discover that these are rarely as simple as  the dreams of children, and that they cover another meaning beyond that  of the realization of a wish.    It would certainly be a simple and convenient solution of the riddle if  the work of analysis made it at all possible for us to trace the  meaningless and intricate dreams of adults back to the infantile type,  to the realization of some intensely experienced desire of the day. But  there is no warrant for such an expectation. Their dreams are generally  full of the most indifferent and bizarre matter, and no trace of the  realization of the wish is to be found in their content.    Before leaving these infantile dreams, which are obviously unrealized  desires, we must not fail to mention another chief characteristic of  dreams, one that has been long noticed, and one which stands out most  clearly in this class. I can replace any of these dreams by a phrase  expressing a desire. If the sea trip had only lasted longer; if I were  only washed and dressed; if I had only been allowed to keep the cherries  instead of giving them to my uncle. But the dream gives something more  than the choice, for here the desire is already realized; its  realization is real and actual. The dream presentations consist chiefly,  if not wholly, of scenes and mainly of visual sense images. Hence a kind  of transformation is not entirely absent in this class of dreams, and  this may be fairly designated as the dream work. _An idea merely  existing in the region of possibility is replaced by a vision of its  accomplishment._          II    THE DREAM MECHANISM      We are compelled to assume that such transformation of scene has also  taken place in intricate dreams, though we do not know whether it has  encountered any possible desire. The dream instanced at the  commencement, which we analyzed somewhat thoroughly, did give us  occasion in two places to suspect something of the kind. Analysis  brought out that my wife was occupied with others at table, and that I  did not like it; in the dream itself _exactly the opposite_ occurs, for  the person who replaces my wife gives me her undivided attention. But  can one wish for anything pleasanter after a disagreeable incident than  that the exact contrary should have occurred, just as the dream has it?  The stinging thought in the analysis, that I have never had anything for  nothing, is similarly connected with the woman's remark in the dream:  \"You have always had such beautiful eyes.\" Some portion of the  opposition between the latent and manifest content of the dream must be  therefore derived from the realization of a wish.    Another manifestation of the dream work which all incoherent dreams have  in common is still more noticeable. Choose any instance, and compare the  number of separate elements in it, or the extent of the dream, if  written down, with the dream thoughts yielded by analysis, and of which  but a trace can be refound in the dream itself. There can be no doubt  that the dream working has resulted in an extraordinary compression or  _condensation_. It is not at first easy to form an opinion as to the  extent of the condensation; the more deeply you go into the analysis,  the more deeply you are impressed by it. There will be found no factor  in the dream whence the chains of associations do not lead in two or  more directions, no scene which has not been pieced together out of two  or more impressions and events. For instance, I once dreamt about a kind  of swimming-bath where the bathers suddenly separated in all directions;  at one place on the edge a person stood bending towards one of the  bathers as if to drag him out. The scene was a composite one, made up  out of an event that occurred at the time of puberty, and of two  pictures, one of which I had seen just shortly before the dream. The two  pictures were The Surprise in the Bath, from Schwind's Cycle of the  Melusine (note the bathers suddenly separating), and The Flood, by an  Italian master. The little incident was that I once witnessed a lady,  who had tarried in the swimming-bath until the men's hour, being helped  out of the water by the swimming-master. The scene in the dream which  was selected for analysis led to a whole group of reminiscences, each  one of which had contributed to the dream content. First of all came the  little episode from the time of my courting, of which I have already  spoken; the pressure of a hand under the table gave rise in the dream to  the \"under the table,\" which I had subsequently to find a place for in  my recollection. There was, of course, at the time not a word about  \"undivided attention.\" Analysis taught me that this factor is the  realization of a desire through its contradictory and related to the  behavior of my wife at the table d'hote. An exactly similar and much  more important episode of our courtship, one which separated us for an  entire day, lies hidden behind this recent recollection. The intimacy,  the hand resting upon the knee, refers to a quite different connection  and to quite other persons. This element in the dream becomes again the  starting-point of two distinct series of reminiscences, and so on.    The stuff of the dream thoughts which has been accumulated for the  formation of the dream scene must be naturally fit for this application.  There must be one or more common factors. The dream work proceeds like  Francis Galton with his family photographs. The different elements are  put one on top of the other; what is common to the composite picture  stands out clearly, the opposing details cancel each other. This process  of reproduction partly explains the wavering statements, of a peculiar  vagueness, in so many elements of the dream. For the interpretation of  dreams this rule holds good: When analysis discloses _uncertainty_, as  to _either_--_or_ read _and_, _taking_ each section of the apparent  alternatives as a separate outlet for a series of impressions.    When there is nothing in common between the dream thoughts, the dream  work takes the trouble to create a something, in order to make a common  presentation feasible in the dream. The simplest way to approximate two  dream thoughts, which have as yet nothing in common, consists in making  such a change in the actual expression of one idea as will meet a slight  responsive recasting in the form of the other idea. The process is  analogous to that of rhyme, when consonance supplies the desired common  factor. A good deal of the dream work consists in the creation of those  frequently very witty, but often exaggerated, digressions. These vary  from the common presentation in the dream content to dream thoughts  which are as varied as are the causes in form and essence which give  rise to them. In the analysis of our example of a dream, I find a like  case of the transformation of a thought in order that it might agree  with another essentially foreign one. In following out the analysis I  struck upon the thought: _I should like to have something for nothing_.  But this formula is not serviceable to the dream. Hence it is replaced  by another one: \"I should like to enjoy something free of cost.\"[1] The  word \"kost\" (taste), with its double meaning, is appropriate to a table  d'hote; it, moreover, is in place through the special sense in the  dream. At home if there is a dish which the children decline, their  mother first tries gentle persuasion, with a \"Just taste it.\" That the  dream work should unhesitatingly use the double meaning of the word is  certainly remarkable; ample experience has shown, however, that the  occurrence is quite usual.    Through condensation of the dream certain constituent parts of its  content are explicable which are peculiar to the dream life alone, and  which are not found in the waking state. Such are the composite and  mixed persons, the extraordinary mixed figures, creations comparable  with the fantastic animal compositions of Orientals; a moment's thought  and these are reduced to unity, whilst the fancies of the dream are ever  formed anew in an inexhaustible profusion. Every one knows such images  in his own dreams; manifold are their origins. I can build up a person  by borrowing one feature from one person and one from another, or by  giving to the form of one the name of another in my dream. I can also  visualize one person, but place him in a position which has occurred to  another. There is a meaning in all these cases when different persons  are amalgamated into one substitute. Such cases denote an \"and,\" a \"just  like,\" a comparison of the original person from a certain point of view,  a comparison which can be also realized in the dream itself. As a rule,  however, the identity of the blended persons is only discoverable by  analysis, and is only indicated in the dream content by the formation of  the \"combined\" person.    The same diversity in their ways of formation and the same rules for its  solution hold good also for the innumerable medley of dream contents,  examples of which I need scarcely adduce. Their strangeness quite  disappears when we resolve not to place them on a level with the objects  of perception as known to us when awake, but to remember that they  represent the art of dream condensation by an exclusion of unnecessary  detail. Prominence is given to the common character of the combination.  Analysis must also generally supply the common features. The dream says  simply: _All these things have an \"x\" in common_. The decomposition of  these mixed images by analysis is often the quickest way to an  interpretation of the dream. Thus I once dreamt that I was sitting with  one of my former university tutors on a bench, which was undergoing a  rapid continuous movement amidst other benches. This was a combination  of lecture-room and moving staircase. I will not pursue the further  result of the thought. Another time I was sitting in a carriage, and on  my lap an"]]]
