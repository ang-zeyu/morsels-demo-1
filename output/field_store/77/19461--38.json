The soft pedal in the square piano simply  interposes a piece of felt between each hammer and its corresponding  string or strings. This felt being much softer than that of the  hammers, the tone is greatly subdued.    The mechanical arrangement of the dampers is very different in the  square from that in the upright. The dampers are above the strings.  Instead of springs to hold them against the strings, they simply rest  upon them with their weight. In many old squares some of the dampers  fall upon nodal points, causing defective damping or harmonic  after-tones.    The stationary parts of the square action are: action frame, to which  is secured the balance rail, balance pins and guide pins, hammer rail,  flange rail, and damper rail. When the key is struck, the parts that  move upward are: the back end of the key, bottom, jack, hammer, back  check, damper wire and damper lever. The hammer falls back upon the  back check immediately after striking, and remains there until the  key is released, when all movable parts fall to rest position.    The action of the jack is the same in all types.      ACTION OF THE GRAND PIANO.    After thoroughly going over the details of the action of the square  and upright pianos, there remains very little to describe in the  action of the grand.    The grand action partakes of the characteristics of both the upright  and the square, and is somewhat more complicated than either.    The bottom and extension are almost identical with those of the  upright; the extension, however, is necessarily very short.    The wippen is of different construction, and somewhat more complicated  in the grand.    The flange rail in the grand is made also to serve the purpose of  regulating rail, as the hammer rail is made to do in the square.    The back check is identical with that of the square.    The dampers are the same in their working principles as those of the  square, but are generally different in construction; yet, some squares  have the same arrangement of dampers as those shown in the cut of the  grand action.    The soft pedal of the grand shifts the entire action to the right so  that the hammers strike only two and in some cases only one of the  strings.    The student should study the three types of actions from the actions  themselves, if possible.    [Illustration: ACTION OF THE GRAND PIANO.]         ACTION OF THE GRAND PIANO.        1.

In most of the better grade  instruments the action is fastened in this way. If the screws have  square heads, your tuning hammer will fit them and bring them out; if  common screws, a screw-driver will suffice. Look through the opening  in the sound board where the hammers strike and see that they are all  down before pulling out the action, lest they break off by catching on  the under side of the sound board. This is almost sure to happen if  actions are out of order.    In most square pianos, the narrow board just below the keys can be  removed by being raised straight up, as it simply sets over screw  heads in the key frame. When this strip is removed, a wire handle will  be found in the middle of the key frame by which to draw out the  action. In some cases, and especially in grands, this strip is secured  by screws found underneath the piano. In other pianos, the action is  held by screws in front of the key frame, which will be revealed by  the removal of the front strip, above referred to.    Be especially careful in placing the action back into the piano. As a  rule, it is safe to keep the right (long) end of the square action  bearing against the right side of entrance, being sure that one end of  action does not get ahead, which might cause some of the hammers to  strike the props for which the openings are left in the back  extremities of action.    While the action is out, study carefully the purpose of every part and  its movements, referring to this and the previous lesson until you  have thoroughly mastered the entire mechanism. Do not rest until you  can name correctly everything you see and know its use so well that  you could explain it satisfactorily to an inquirer. Sometimes the  tuner is asked a great many perplexing questions and is expected to  respond intelligently.    We have dealt with the three types of actions that are most commonly  found in the three types of pianos. The student must bear in mind that  there are numerous manufacturers of actions, and that each has his  peculiar method of constructing his special action to bring about the  desired results, which are practically the same in all cases; and  consequently, while a variety of construction will confront the  beginner in piano regulating and repairing, he will understand the  construction and requirements of any action that may demand his skill  from the foregoing instruction, if properly mastered. In this, as in  all other mechanical professions, one's inventive genius must often be  summoned to assist in surmounting obstacles which are sure to arise  unexpectedly.      QUESTIONS ON LESSON IV.        1. From a philosophical point of view, which do you consider the      easiest and most perfect of the three types of actions? Also give      reasons.        2. Considering the wippen and its attachments as one part, how      many parts move when a key is struck in the upright piano? How      many in the square?        3. Name the parts found in the upright action that are absent in      the square.        4. Describe the three methods by which soft tone is obtained from      use of soft pedal in the three types of actions.        5. What rail serves two purposes in the square action, and what      are they? What rail serves two purposes in the grand action, and      what are they?          LESSON V.    ~REGULATING AND REPAIRING.~    FAULTS IN PIANOS, ASIDE FROM THE ACTION, AND THEIR REMEDIES.      One of the most common, and, at the same time, most annoying  conditions both to the owner of the piano and the tuner, is the  \"sympathetic rattle.\" This trouble is most usual in the square and the  grand pianos and is generally due to some loose substance lying on the  sound board. The rattle will be apparent only when certain keys are  struck, other tones being perfectly free from it. These tones cause  the sound board to vibrate in sympathy, so to speak, with the weight  of the intruding substance at the point where it lies, and if it be  moved the distance of six inches it will sometimes cease to respond to  these particular tones, but may respond to others, or cease to cause  any trouble.    The article may generally be found near the front of the sound board  under the top piece of the case, this being the place where it would  most likely fall. No special instrument is made for the purpose of  searching for such objects, but one can be easily devised with which  the tuner can feel all over the sound board, and remove such articles  as well as dust and dirt. Secure a piece of rattan or good pliable  hickory, and draw it down to the width of half an inch, thin enough to  bend easily, and long enough to reach anywhere under the stringing or  metal plate. By putting a cloth over this stick you can remove  anything that comes in its way. Some difficulty will be found,  however, in getting under the plate in some pianos. In case you cannot  procure a suitable piece of wood, a piece of clock spring will be  found to answer very well. We have taken from pianos such articles as  pencils, pieces of candy, dolls, pointers used by music teachers,  tacks, nails, pennies, buttons, pieces of broken lamp chimneys, etc.,  etc., any one of which is sufficient to render the piano unfit for  use. The sound board of the upright being vertical prevents its being  subject to the above difficulty.    A split in the sound board, in any style of piano, sometimes causes  trouble due to the vibrating edges of the board coming in contact  with each other. Insert the point of your screwdriver in the crack,  holding it there firmly; if the rattling stops, the difficulty is  discovered, and may be remedied by placing a screw or wedge in the  crack, or a wedge of wood, cork or rubber between the sound board and  iron plate or casing, if the location of the trouble permits. While  this method seems a perfunctory one, it is nevertheless the best the  tuner is prepared to do, for it is next to impossible to glue a crack  in the sound board successfully outside of a regular factory or repair  shop, where the instrument may be taken all apart and a new sound  board put in or the old one properly repaired.    Sometimes the sound board gets loose or unglued at the edges, or the  bridges or ribs come loose. Any part of the piano where there is  vibration or loose material may become the source of the sympathetic  rattle, as even parts of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17575"],[0,"How to Camp Out (#5)"],[1,"than is usually worn at home in summer. They should be cut high in the  waist to cover the stomach well, and thus prevent sickness.    The question of wearing \"hip-pants,\" or using suspenders, is worth some  attention. The yachting-shirt by custom is worn with hip-pantaloons, and  often with a belt around the waist; and this tightening appears to do no  mischief to the majority of people. Some, however, find it very  uncomfortable, and others are speedily attacked by pains and indigestion  in consequence of having a tight waist. If you are in the habit of  wearing suspenders, do not change now. If you do not like to wear them  over the shirt, you can wear them over a light under-shirt, and have the  suspender straps come through small holes in the dress-shirt. In that  case cut the holes low enough so that the dress-shirt will fold over the  top of the trousers, and give the appearance of hip-pantaloons. If you  undertake to wear the suspenders next to the skin, they will gall you. A  fortnight's tramping and camping will about ruin a pair of trousers:  therefore it is not well to have them made of any thing very expensive.    Camping offers a fine opportunity to wear out old clothes, and to throw  them away when you have done with them. You can send home by mail or  express your soiled underclothes that are too good to lose or to be  washed by your unskilled hands.          CHAPTER V.    STOVES AND COOKING-UTENSILS.      If you have a permanent camp, or if moving you have wagon-room enough,  you will find a stove to be most valuable property. If your party is  large it is almost a necessity.    For a permanent camp you can generally get something second-hand at a  stove-dealer's or the junk-shop. For the march you will need a stove of  sheet iron. About the simplest, smallest, and cheapest thing is a  round-cornered box made of sheet iron, eighteen to twenty-four inches  long and nine to twelve inches high. It needs no bottom: the ground will  answer for that. The top, which is fixed, is a flat piece of sheet iron,  with a hole near one end large enough for a pot or pan, and a hole  (collar) for the funnel near the other end. It is well also to have a  small hole, with a slide to open and close it with, in the end of the  box near the bottom, so as to put in wood, and regulate the draught; but  you can dispense with the slide by raising the stove from the ground  when you want to admit fuel or air.    [Illustration]    I have used a more elaborate article than this. It is an old sheet-iron  stove that came home from the army, and has since been taken down the  coast and around the mountains with parties of ten to twenty. It was  almost an indispensable article with such large companies. It is a  round-cornered box, twenty-one inches long by twenty wide, and thirteen  inches high, with a slide in the front end to admit air and fuel. The  bottom is fixed to the body; the top removes, and is fitted loosely to  the body after the style of a firkin-cover, i.e., the flange, which is  deep and strong, goes _outside_ the stove. There are two holes on the  top 5-1/2 inches in diameter, and two 7-1/2 inches, besides the collar  for the funnel; and these holes have covers neatly fitted. All of the  cooking-utensils and the funnel can be packed inside the stove; and, if  you fear it may upset on the march, you can tie the handles of the stove  to those of the top piece.    A stove like this will cost about ten dollars; but it is a treasure for  a large party or one where there are ladies, or those who object to  having their eyes filled with smoke. The coffee-pot and tea-pot for this  stove have \"sunk bottoms,\" and hence will boil quicker by presenting  more surface to the fire. You should cover the bottom of the stove with  four inches or more of earth before making a fire in it.    To prevent the pots and kettles from smutting every thing they touch,  each has a separate bag in which it is packed and carried.    The funnel was in five joints, each eighteen inches long, and made upon  the \"telescope\" principle, which is objectionable on account of the smut  and the jams the funnel is sure to receive. In practice we have found  three lengths sufficient, but have had two elbows made; and with these  we can use the stove in an old house, shed, or tent, and secure good  draught.    If you have ladies in your party, or those to whom the rough side of  camping-out offers few attractions, it is well to consider this stove  question. Either of these here described must be handled and transported  with care.    A more substantial article is the Dutch oven, now almost unknown in many  of the States. It is simply a deep, bailed frying-pan with a heavy  cast-iron cover that fits on and overhangs the top. By putting the oven  on the coals, and making a fire on the cover, you can bake in it very  well. Thousands of these were used by the army during the war, and they  are still very extensively used in the South. If their weight is no  objection to your plans, I should advise you to have a Dutch oven. They  are not expensive if you can find one to buy. If you cannot find one for  sale, see if you cannot improvise one in some way by getting a heavy  cover for a deep frying-pan. It would be well to try such an  improvisation at home before starting, and learn if it will bake or  burn, before taking it with you.    Another substitute for a stove is one much used nowadays by  camping-parties, and is suited for permanent camps. It is the top of an  old cooking-stove, with a length or two of funnel. If you build a good  tight fireplace underneath, it answers pretty well. The objection to it  is the difficulty of making and keeping the fireplace tight, and it  smokes badly when the wind is not favorable for draught. I have seen a  great many of these in use, but never knew but one that did well in all  weathers, and this had a fireplace nicely built of brick and mortar, and  a tight iron door.    Still another article that can be used in permanent camps, or if you  have a wagon, is the old-fashioned \"Yankee baker,\" now almost unknown.  You can easily find a tinman who has seen and can make one. There is  not, however, very often an occasion for baking in camp, or at least  most people prefer to fry, boil, or broil.    Camp-stoves are now a regular article of trade; many of them are good,  and many are worthless. I cannot undertake to state here the merits or  demerits of any particular kind; but before putting money into any I  should try to get the advice of some practical man, and not buy any  thing with hinged joints or complicated mechanism.          CHAPTER VI.    COOKING, AND THE CARE OF FOOD.      When living in the open air the appetite is so good, and the pleasure of  getting your own meals is so great, that, whatever may be cooked, it is  excellent.    [Illustration]    You will need a frying-pan and a coffee-pot, even if you are carrying  all your baggage upon your back. You can do a great deal of good cooking  with these two utensils, after having had experience; and it is  experience, rather than recipes and instructions, that you need.  Soldiers in the field used to unsolder their tin canteens, and make two  frying-pans of them; and I have seen a deep pressed-tin plate used by  having two loops riveted on the edges opposite each other to run a  handle through. Food fried in such plates needs careful attention and a  low fire; and, as the plates themselves are somewhat delicate, they  cannot be used roughly.    [Illustration]    It is far better to carry a real frying-pan, especially if there are  three or more in your party. If you have transportation, or are going  into a permanent camp, do not think of the tin article.    A coffee-pot with a bail and handle is better than one with a handle  only, and a lip is better than a spout; since handles and spouts are apt  to unsolder.    Young people are apt to put their pot or frying-pan on the burning wood,  and it soon tips over. Also they let the pot boil over, and presently it  unsolders for want of water. Few think to keep the handle so that it  can be touched without burning or smutting; and hardly any young person  knows that pitchy wood will give a bad flavor to any thing cooked over  it on an open fire. Live coals are rather better, therefore, than the  blaze of a new fire.    If your frying-pan catches fire inside, do not get frightened, but take  it off instantly, and blow out the fire, or smother it with the cover or  a board if you cannot blow it out.    You will do well to consult a cook-book if you wish for variety in your  cooking; but some things not found in cook-books I will give you here.    Stale bread, pilot-bread, dried corn-cakes, and crumbs, soaked a few  minutes in water, or better still in milk, and fried, are all quite  palatable.    In frying bread, or any thing else, have the fat boiling hot before you  put in the food: this prevents it from soaking fat.      BAKED BEANS, BEEF, AND FISH.    Lumbermen bake beans deliciously in an iron pot that has a cover with a  projecting rim to prevent the ashes from getting in the pot. The beans  are first parboiled in one or two waters until the outside skin begins  to crack. They are then put into the baking-pot, and salt pork at the  rate of a pound to a quart and a half of dry beans is placed just under  the surface of the beans. The rind of the pork should be gashed so that  it will cut easily after baking. Two or three tablespoonfuls of molasses  are put in, and a little salt, unless the pork is considerably lean.  Water enough is added to cover the beans.    A hole three feet or more deep is dug in the ground, and heated for an  hour by a good hot fire. The coals are then shovelled out, and the pot  put in the hole, and immediately buried by throwing back the coals, and  covering all with dry earth. In this condition they are left to bake all  night.    On the same principle very tough beef was cooked"]]]
