It is to be regretted, that no person having any practical knowledge of  perfumery was placed on the jury of Class IV or XXIX. Had such been the  case, the desires of the exhibitors would probably have been realized,  and European perfumers benefited by the introduction of new odors from  the East. Some of the ottos sent by a native perfumer of Benares were  deemed worthy of honorable mention. Such as _Chumeylee_, _Beyla_,  _Begla_, _Moteya_, and many others from the Moluccas, but without any  information respecting them.    We are not going to speak of, perhaps, more than a tithe of the plants  that have a perfume--only those will be mentioned that are used by the  operative perfumer, and such as are imitated by him in consequence of  there being a demand for the article, which circumstances prevent him  from obtaining in its genuine state. The first that comes under our  notice is--    ALLSPICE.--The odoriferous principle of allspice, commonly  called pimento, is obtained by distilling the dried fruit, before it is  quite ripe, of the _Eugenia pimenta_ and _Myrtus pimenta_ with water. It  is thus procured as an essential oil; it is but little used in  perfumery, and when so, only in combination with other spice oils; for  scenting soap it is, however, very agreeable, and much resembles the  smell of cloves, and deserves more attention than it has hitherto  received. Mixed in the proportion of two ounces of oil of allspice with  one gallon of rectified spirit of wine, it forms what may be termed  extract of allspice, which extract will be found very useful in the  manufacture of low-priced bouquets.    ALMONDS.        \"Mark well the flow'ring almonds in the wood;      If od'rous blooms the bearing branches load,      The glebe will answer to the sylvan reign,      Great heats will follow, and large crops of grain.\"        VIRGIL.    This perfume has been much esteemed for many ages. It may be procured by  distilling the leaves of any of the laurel tribe, and the kernels of  stone fruit; for trade purposes, it is obtained from the bitter  almonds, and exists in the skin or pellicle that covers the seed after  it is shelled. In the ordinary way, the almonds are put into the press  for the purpose of obtaining the mild or fat oil from the nut; the cake  which is left after this process is then mixed with salt and water, and  allowed to remain together for about twenty-four hours prior to  distillation. The reason for moistening the cake is well understood to  the practical chemist, and although we are not treating the subject of  perfumery in a chemical sense, but only in a practical way, it may not  be inappropriate here to observe, that the essential oil of almonds does  not exist ready formed to any extent in the nut, but that it is produced  by a species of fermentation, from the amygdalin and emulsine contained  in the almonds, together with the water that is added. Analogous  substances exist in laurel leaves, and hence the same course is to be  pursued when they are distilled. Some manufacturers put the moistened  cake into a bag of coarse cloth, or spread it upon a sieve, and then  force the stream through it; in either case, the essential oil of the  almond rises with the watery vapor, and is condensed in the still-worm.  In this concentrated form, the odor of almonds is far from agreeable;  but when diluted with spirit, in the proportion of about one and a half  ounce of the oil to a gallon of spirit or alcohol, it is very pleasant.    [Illustration: Almond.]    The essential oil of almonds, enters into combination with soap, cold  cream, and many other materials prepared by the perfumer; for which see  their respective titles.    Fourteen pounds of the cake yield about one ounce of essential oil.    In experiments with this substance, it must be carefully remembered that  it is exceedingly _poisonous_, and, therefore, great caution is  necessary in its admixture with substances used as a cosmetic, otherwise  dangerous results may ensue.    _Artificial Otto of Almonds._--Five or six years ago, Mr. Mansfield, of  Weybridge, took out a patent for the manufacture of otto of almonds from  benzole. (Benzole is obtained from tar oil.) His apparatus, according to  the Report of the juries of the 1851 Exhibition, consists of a large  glass tube in the form of a coil, which at the upper end divides into  two tubes; each of which is provided with a funnel. A stream of nitric  acid flows slowly into one of the funnels, and benzole into the other.  The two substances meet at the point of union of the tubes, and a  combination ensues with the evolution of heat. As the newly formed  compound flows down through the coil it becomes cool, and is collected  at the lower extremity; it then requires to be washed with water, and  lastly with a dilute solution of carbonate of soda, to render it fit for  use. Nitro-benzole, which is the chemical name for this artificial otto  of almonds, has a different odor to the true otto of almonds, but it can  nevertheless be used for perfuming soap. Mr. Mansfield writes to me  under date of January 3d, 1855:--\"In 1851, Messrs. Gosnell, of Three  King Court, began to make this perfume under my license; latterly I  withdrew the license from them by their consent, and since then it is  not made that I am aware of.\" It is, however, quite common in Paris.    ANISE.--The odorous principle is procured by distilling the  seeds of the plant _Pimpinella anisum_; the product is the oil of  aniseed of commerce. As it congeals at a temperature of about 50 deg. Fahr.,  it is frequently adulterated with a little spermaceti, to give a certain  solidity to it, whereby other cheaper essential oils can be added to it  with less chance of detection. As the oil of aniseed is quite soluble in  spirit, and the spermaceti insoluble, the fraud is easily detected.    This perfume is exceedingly strong, and is, therefore, well adapted for  mixing with soap and for scenting pomatums, but does not do nicely in  compounds for handkerchief use.    BALM, oil of Balm, called also oil of Melissa, is obtained by  distilling the leaves of the _Melissa officinalis_ with water; it comes  from the still tap with the condensed steam or water, from which it is  separated with the tap funnel. But it is very little used in perfumery,  if we except its combination in _Aqua di Argento_.    BALSAM.--Under this title there are two or three substances  used in perfumery, such as balsam of Peru, balsam of Tolu, and balsam of  storax (also called liquid amber). The first-named, is procured from the  _Myroxylon peruiferum_; it exudes from the tree when wounded, and is  also obtained by boiling down the bark and branches in water. The latter  is the most common method for procuring it. It has a strong odor, like  benzoin.    Balsam of Tolu flows from the _Toluifera balsammum_. It resembles common  resin (rosin); with the least warmth, however, it runs to a liquid, like  brown treacle. The smell of it is particularly agreeable, and being  soluble in alcohol makes a good basis for a bouquet, giving in this  respect a permanence of odor to a perfume which the simple solution of  an oil would not possess. For this purpose all these balsams are very  useful, though not so much used as they might be.        \"ULEX has found that balsam of Tolu is frequently      adulterated with common resin. To detect this adulteration he      pours sulphuric acid on the balsam, and heats the mixture, when      the balsam dissolves to a cherry-red fluid, without evolving      sulphurous acid, but with the escape of benzoic or cinnamic acid,      if no common resin is present. On the contrary, the balsam foams,      blackens, and much sulphurous acid is set free, if it is      adulterated with common resin.\"--_Archives der Pharmacie_.    Balsam of storax, commonly called gum styrax, is obtained in the same  manner, and possessing similar properties, with a slight variation of  odor, is applicable in the same manner as the above.    They are all imported from South America, Chili, and Mexico, where the  trees that produce them are indigenous.    BAY, oil of sweet Bay, also termed essential oil of  laurel-berries, is a very fragrant substance, procured by distillation  from the berries of the bay laurel. Though very pleasant, it is not much  used.    BERGAMOT.--This most useful perfume is procured from the  _Citrus Bergamia_, by expression from the peel of the fruit. It has a  soft sweet odor, too well known to need description here. When new and  good it has a greenish-yellow tint, but loses its greenness by age,  especially if kept in imperfectly corked bottles. It then becomes cloudy  from the deposit of resinous matter, produced by the contact of the air,  and acquires a turpentine smell.    It is best preserved in well-stoppered bottles, kept in a cool cellar,  and in the dark; light, especially the direct sunshine, quickly  deteriorates its odor. This observation may be applied, indeed, to all  perfumes, except rose, which is not so spoiled.    When bergamot is mixed with other essential oils it greatly adds to  their richness, and gives a sweetness to spice oils attainable by no  other means, and such compounds are much used in the most highly scented  soaps. Mixed with rectified spirit in the proportions of about four  ounces of bergamot to a gallon, it forms what is called \"extract of  bergamot,\" and in this state is used for the handkerchief. Though well  covered with extract of orris and other matters, it is the leading  ingredient in Bayley and Blew's Ess. Bouquet (see BOUQUETS).    [Illustration: Styrax Benzoin.]    BENZOIN, also called Benjamin.--This is a very useful substance  to perfumers. It exudes from the _Styrax benzoin_ by wounding the tree,  and drying, becomes a hard gum-resin. It is principally imported from  Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and Siam. The best kind comes from the latter  place,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16379"],[0,"Children's Classics in Dramatic Form, Book Two (#5)"],[1,"water come from?

Yes, if the hares will think that, too.    HEDGEHOG. Well, we will let them alone as we have always done.    WIFE. But they will not let us alone. Yesterday they called at me while  I was eating here.    HEDGEHOG. What did they say to you?    WIFE. Oh, such things as \"Short-legs,\" and \"Duck-legs.\"    HEDGEHOG. Here comes one of them now!    WIFE. He is one who called at me. I'll hide till he goes by.    [_She hides among the cabbages. The_ HARE _enters._]    HEDGEHOG. Good-morning, sir.    HARE. Why do you speak to me?    HEDGEHOG.

Look at your silly little legs!    HEDGEHOG. They are quite as good as yours, sir.    HARE. As good as mine! Hear him! You can only walk with those legs, sir.    HEDGEHOG.

Are you crazy?    HEDGEHOG. Come, come, let's begin the race!    HARE. Ha, ha! Well, I'll run with you. You ought to know just how silly  your little duck-legs are.    HEDGEHOG. Let us go to this end of the furrow to begin.    HAKE. I will run to the brook and back while you are getting there.    HEDGEHOG. As you please.    (_The Hare runs off._)    Wife, wife, did you hear?    WIFE. I heard. Are you crazy?    HEDGEHOG. Go to the other end of this furrow, wife.    WIFE. And why should I do that?    HEDGEHOG. The hare will run in the other furrow. When he comes to your  end, put up your head and say, \"I am already here.\"    WIFE. Ha, ha! He will think that I am you.    HEDGEHOG. Exactly.    WIFE. Ha, ha, ha! I go, Mr. Hedgehog! I go! You may be short on legs, my  dear, but you are long on brains.    [_She runs to other end of furrow. Mr. Hedgehog goes to his end._]    [_The_ HARE _enters._]    HARE. Well, are you ready?    HEDGEHOG. I am ready.    HARE. One, two, three, go!    [_The Hare runs swiftly. The Hedgehog sits.
