After his voice changed, he played  the organ at Waltham Abbey, and some time later was chosen organist  royal to Queen Elizabeth. His pecuniary returns for his talent did not  make him rich, though he bore the title after 1542 of Gentleman of the  Chapel Royal, for his stipend was sevenpence a day. Some gain may  possibly have come to him, however, from his publication, late in life,  under the queen's special patent, of a collection of hymns and tunes.    He wrote much and was the real founder of the English Church school of  composers, but though St. Paul's was at one time well supplied with his  motets and anthems, it is impossible now to give a list of Tallis'  compositions for the Church. His music was written originally to Latin  words, but when, after the Reformation, the use of vernacular hymns, was  introduced he probably adapted his scores to either language.    It is inferred that he was in attendance on Queen Elizabeth at her  palace in Greenwich when he died, for he was buried in the old parish  church there in November, 1585. The rustic rhymer who indited his  epitaph evidently did the best he could to embalm the virtues of the  great musician as a man, a citizen, and a husband:        Enterred here doth ly a worthy wyght,        Who for long time in musick bore the bell:      His name to shew was Thomas Tallis hyght;        In honest vertuous lyff he dyd excell.        He served long tyme in chappel with grete prayse,        Fower sovereygnes reignes, (a thing not often seene);      I mean King Henry and Prince Edward's dayes,        Quene Marie, and Elizabeth our quene.        He maryed was, though children he had none,        And lyv'd in love full three and thirty yeres      With loyal spowse, whose name yclept was Jone,        Who, here entombed, him company now bears.        As he dyd lyve, so also dyd he dy,        In myld and quyet sort, O happy man!      To God ful oft for mercy did he cry;        Wherefore he lyves, let Deth do what he can.      \"THE GOD OF ABRAHAM PRAISE.\"    This is one of the thanksgivings of the ages.        The God of Abraham praise,        Who reigns enthroned above;      Ancient of everlasting days,        And God of love.      Jehovah, Great I AM!        By earth and heaven confessed,      I bow and bless the sacred Name,        Forever blest.    The hymn, of twelve eight-line stanzas, is too long to quote entire,  but is found in both the _Plymouth_ and _Methodist Hymnals_.    Thomas Olivers, born in Tregynon, near Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Wales,  1725, was, according to local testimony, \"the worst boy known in all  that country, for thirty years.\" It is more charitable to say that he  was a poor fellow who had no friends. Left an orphan at five years of  age, he was passed from one relative to another until all were tired of  him, and he was \"bound out\" to a shoemaker. Almost inevitably the  neglected lad grew up wicked, for no one appeared to care for his habits  and morals, and as he sank lower in the various vices encouraged by bad  company, there were more kicks for him than helping hands. At the age of  eighteen his reputation in the town had become so unsavory that he was  forced to shift for himself elsewhere.    Providence led him, when shabby and penniless, to the old seaport town  of Bristol, where Whitefield was at that time preaching,[4] and there  the young sinner heard the divine message that lifted him to his feet.    [Footnote 4: Whitefield's text was, \"Is not this a brand plucked out of  the fire?\" Zach. 3:2.]    \"When that sermon began,\" he said, \"I was one of the most abandoned and  profligate young men living; before it ended I was a new creature. The  world was all changed for Tom Olivers.\"    His new life, thus begun, lasted on earth more than sixty useful years.  He left a shining record as a preacher of righteousness, and died in the  triumphs of faith, November, 1799. Before he passed away he saw at least  thirty editions of his hymn published, but the soul-music it has  awakened among the spiritual children of Abraham can only reach him in  heaven. Some of its words have been the last earthly song of many, as  they were of the eminent Methodist theologian, Richard Watson--          I shall behold His face,        I shall His power adore,      And sing the wonders of His grace          Forevermore.      _THE TUNE._    The precise date of the tune \"Leoni\" is unknown, as also the precise  date of the hymn. The story is that Olivers visited the great \"Duke's  Place\" Synagogue, Aldgate, London, and heard Meyer Lyon (Leoni) sing the  Yigdal or long doxology to an air so noble and impressive that it  haunted him till he learned it and fitted to it the sublime stanzas of  his song. Lyon, a noted Jewish musician and vocalist, was chorister of  this London Synagogue during the latter part of the 18th century and the  Yigdal was a portion of the Hebrew Liturgy composed in medieval times,  it is said, by Daniel Ben Judah. The fact that the Methodist leaders  took Olivers from his bench to be one of their preachers answers any  suggestion that the converted shoemaker _copied_ the Jewish hymn and put  Christian phrases in it. He knew nothing of Hebrew, and had he known  it, a literal translation of the Yigdal will show hardly a similarity to  his evangelical lines. Only the music as Leoni sang it prompted his own  song, and he gratefully put the singer's name to it. Montgomery, who  admired the majestic style of the hymn, and its glorious imagery, said  of its author, \"The man who wrote that hymn must have had the finest ear  imaginable, for on account of the peculiar measure, none but a person of  equal musical and poetic taste could have produced the harmony  perceptible in the verse.\"    Whether the hymnist or some one else fitted the hymn to the tune, the  \"fine ear\" and \"poetic taste\" that Montgomery applauded are evident  enough in the union.      \"O WORSHIP THE KING ALL GLORIOUS ABOVE.\"    This hymn of Sir Robert Grant has become almost universally known, and  is often used as a morning or opening service song by choirs and  congregations of all creeds. The favorite stanzas are the first four--        O worship the King all-glorious above,      And gratefully sing His wonderful love--      Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,      Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.        O tell of His might, and sing of His grace,      Whose robe is the light, whose canopy, space;      His chariots of wrath the deep thunder-clouds form,      And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.        Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite?      It breathes in the air, it shines in the light,      It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,      And sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.        Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,      In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail.      Thy mercies how tender! how firm to the end!      Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!    This is a model hymn of worship. Like the previous one by Thomas  Olivers, it is strongly Hebrew in its tone and diction, and drew its  inspiration from the Old Testament Psalter, the text-book of all true  praise-song.    Sir Robert Grant was born in the county of Inverness, Scotland, in 1785,  and educated at Cambridge. He was many years member of Parliament for  Inverness and a director in the East India Company, and 1834 was  appointed Governor of Bombay. He died at Dapoorie, Western India, July  9, 1838.    Sir Robert was a man of deep Christian feeling and a poetic mind. His  writings were not numerous, but their thoughtful beauty endeared him to  a wide circle of readers. In 1839 his brother, Lord Glenelg, published  twelve of his poetical pieces, and a new edition in 1868. The volume  contains the more or less well-known hymns--        The starry firmament on high.        Saviour, when in dust to Thee,    and--        When gathering clouds around I view.    Sir Robert's death, when scarcely past his prime, would indicate a  decline by reason of illness, and perhaps other serious affliction, that  justified the poetic license in the submissive verses beginning--        Thy mercy heard my infant prayer.           *       *       *       *       *        And now _in age_ and grief Thy name      Does still my languid heart inflame,        And bow my faltering knee.      Oh, yet this bosom feels the fire,      This trembling hand and drooping lyre        Have yet a strain for Thee.      _THE TUNE._    Several musical pieces written to the hymn, \"O, Worship the King,\" have  appeared in church psalm-books, and others have been borrowed for it,  but the one oftenest sung to its words is Haydn's \"Lyons.\" Its vigor and  spirit best fit it for Grant's noble lyric.      \"MAJESTIC SWEETNESS SITS ENTHRONED.\"    Rev. Samuel Stennett D.D., the author of this hymn, was the son of Rev.  Joseph Stennett, and grandson of Rev. Joseph Stennett D.D., who wrote--        Another six days' work is done,      Another Sabbath is begun.    All were Baptist ministers. Samuel was born in 1727, at Exeter, Eng.,  and at the age of twenty-one became his father's assistant, and  subsequently his successor over the church in Little Wild Street,  Lincoln's Inn Fields, London.        Majestic sweetness sits enthroned        Upon the Saviour's brow;      His head with radiant glories crowned,        His lips with grace o'erflow.           *       *       *       *       *        To Him I owe my life and breath        And all the joys I have;      He makes me triumph over death,        He saves me from the grave.           *       *       *       *       *        Since from His bounty I receive        Such proofs of love divine,      Had I a thousand hearts to give,        Lord, they should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],[0,"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#5)"],[1,"from the  Minister to my landlord, and I am going to take it up to him.\"    Monsieur Bernard was just beginning to shave when the porter knocked at  his door.    \"What do you want, Durand?\"    \"Sir,\" replied the other, lifting his cap, \"a soldier has just brought  this for you. It comes from the Ministry.\" And he handed to Monsieur  Bernard the letter, the envelope of which bore the stamp of the War  Department.    \"Heavens!\" exclaimed Monsieur Bernard, in such agitation that he all but  cut himself. \"From the Minister of War! I am sure it is my nomination as  Knight of the Legion of Honour, which I have long solicited. At last  they have done justice to my good conduct. Here, Durand,\" said he,  fumbling in his waistcoat-pocket, \"here are five francs to drink to my  health. Stay! I haven't my purse about me. Wait, and I will give you the  money in a moment.\"    The porter was so overcome by this stunning fit of generosity, which was  not at all in accordance with his landlord's ordinary habits, that he  absolutely put on his cap again.    But Monsieur Bernard, who at any other time would have severely  reprimanded this infraction of the laws of social hierarchy, appeared  not to notice it. He put on his spectacles, broke the seal of the  envelope with the respectful anxiety of a vizier receiving a sultan's  firman, and began to read the dispatch. At the first line a frightful  grimace ploughed his fat, monk-like cheeks with crimson furrows, and his  little eyes flashed sparks that seemed ready to set fire to his bushy  wig. In fact, all his features were so turned upside-down that you would  have said his countenance had just suffered a shock of face-quake.    For these were the contents of the letter bearing the ministerial stamp,  brought by a dragoon--orderly, and for which Durand had given the  government a receipt:         \"Friend landlord: Politeness-who, according to ancient mythology,       is the grandmother of good manners--compels me to inform you that I       am under the cruel necessity of not conforming to the prevalent       custom of paying rent--prevalent especially when the rent is due. Up       to this morning I had cherished the hope of being able to celebrate       this fair day by the payments of my three quarters. Vain chimera,       bitter illusion! While I was slumbering on the pillow of       confidence, ill-luck--what the Greeks call _ananke_--was scattering       my hopes. The returns on which I counted--times are so bad!-have       failed, and of the considerable sums which I was to receive I have       only realised three francs, which were lent me, and I will not       insult you by the offer of them. Better days will come for our dear       country and for me. Doubt it not, sir! When they come, I shall fly       to inform you of their arrival, and to withdraw from your lodgings       the precious objects which I leave there, putting them under your       protection and that of the law, which hinders you from selling them       before the expiration of a year, in case you should be disposed to       try to do so with the object of obtaining the sum for which you       stand credited in the ledger of my honesty. I commend to your       special care my piano, and also the large frame containing sixty       locks of hair whose different colours run through the whole gamut       of capillary shades; the scissors of love have stolen them from the       forehead of the Graces.\"         \"Therefore, dear sir, and landlord, you may dispose of the roof       under which I have dwelt. I grant you full authority, and have       hereto set my hand and seal.\"         \"ALEXANDER SCHAUNARD\"    On finishing this letter, (which the artist had written at the desk of a  friend who was a clerk in the War Office,) Monsieur Bernard indignantly  crushed it in his hand, and as his glance fell on old Durand, who was  waiting for the promised gratification, he roughly demanded what he was  doing.    \"Waiting, sir.\"    \"For what?\"    \"For the present, on account of the good news,\" stammered the porter.    \"Get out, you scoundrel! Do you presume to speak to me with your cap  on?\"    \"But, sir--\"    \"Don't you answer me! Get out! No, stay there! We shall go up to the  room of that scamp of an artist who has run off without paying.\"    \"What! Monsieur Schaunard?\" ejaculated the porter.    \"Yes,\" cried the landlord with increasing fury, \"and if he has carried  away the smallest article, I send you off, straight off!\"    \"But it can't be,\" murmured the poor porter, \"Monsieur Schaunard has not  run away. He has gone to get change to pay you, and order a cart for his  furniture.\"    \"A cart for his furniture!\" exclaimed the other, \"run! I'm sure he has  it here. He laid a trap to get you away from your lodge, fool that you  are!\"    \"Fool that I am! Heaven help me!\" cried the porter, all in a tremble  before the thundering wrath of his superior, who hurried him down the  stairs. When they arrived in the court the porter was hailed by the  young man in the white hat.    \"Come now! Am I not soon going to be in possession of my lodging? Is  this the eighth of April? Did I hire a room here and pay you a deposit  to bind the bargain? Yes or no?\"    \"Excuse me, sir,\" interposed the landlord, \"I am at your service.  Durand, I will talk to the gentleman myself. Run up there, that scamp  Schaunard has come back to pack up. If you find him, shut him in, and  then come down again and run for the police.\"    Old Durand vanished up the staircase.    \"Excuse me, sir,\" continued the landlord, with a bow to the young man  now left alone with him, \"to whom have I the honour of speaking?\"    \"Your new tenant. I have hired a room in the sixth story of this house,  and am beginning to be tired of waiting for my lodging to become  vacant.\"    \"I am very sorry indeed,\" replied Monsieur Bernard, \"there has been a  little difficulty with one of my tenants, the one whom you are to  replace.\"    \"Sir,\" cried old Durand from a window at the very top of the house,  \"Monsieur Schaunard is not here, but his room--stupid!--I mean he has  carried nothing away, not a hair, sir!\"    \"Very well, come down,\" replied the landlord. \"Have a little patience, I  beg of you,\" he continued to the young man. \"My porter will bring down  to the cellar the furniture in the room of my defaulting tenant, and you  may take possession in half an hour. Beside, your furniture has not come  yet.\"    \"But it has,\" answered the young man quietly.    Monsieur Bernard looked around, and saw only the large screens which had  already mystified his porter.    \"How is this?\" he muttered. \"I don't see anything.\"    \"Behold!\" replied the youth, unfolding the leaves of the frame, and  displaying to the view of the astonished landlord a magnificent interior  of a palace, with jasper columns, bas-reliefs, and paintings of old  masters.    \"But your furniture?\" demanded Monsieur Bernard.    \"Here it is,\" replied the young man, pointing to the splendid furniture  _painted_ in the palace, which he had bought at a sale of second-hand  theatrical decorations.    \"I hope you have some more serious furniture than this,\" said the  landlord. \"You know I must have security for my rent.\"    \"The deuce! Is a palace not sufficient security for the rent of a  garret?\"    \"No sir, I want real chairs and tables in solid mahogany.\"    \"Alas! Neither gold nor mahogany makes us happy, as for the ancient poet  well says. And I can't bear mahogany; it's too common a wood. Everybody  has it.\"    \"But surely sir, you must have some sort of furniture.\"    \"No, it takes up too much room. You are stuck full of chairs, and have  no place to sit down.\"    \"But at any rate, you have a bed. What do you sleep on?\"    \"On a good conscience, sir.\"    \"Excuse me, one more question,\" said the landlord, \"What is your  profession?\"    At this very moment the young man's porter, returning on his second  trip, entered the court. Among the articles with which his truck was  loaded, an easel occupied a conspicuous position.    \"Sir! Sir!!\" shrieked old Durance, pointing out the easel to his  landlord, \"it's a painter!\"    \"I was sure he was an artist!\" exclaimed the landlord in his turn, the  hair of his wig standing up in affright, \"a painter!! And you never  inquired after this person,\" he continued to his porter, \"you didn't  know what he did!\"    \"He gave me five francs _arrest_,\" answered the poor fellow, \"how could  I suspect--\"    \"When you have finished,\" put in the stranger--    \"Sir,\" replied Monsieur Bernard, mounting his spectacles with great  decision, \"since you have no furniture, you can't come in. The law  authorizes me to refuse a tenant who brings no security.\"    \"And my word, then?\"    \"Your word is not furniture, you must go somewhere else. Durance will  give you back your earnest money.\"    \"Oh dear!\" exclaimed the porter, in consternation, \"I've put it in the  Savings' Bank.\"    \"But consider sir,\" objected the young man. \"I can't find another  lodging in a moment! At least grant me hospitality for a day.\"    \"Go to a hotel!\" replied Monsieur Bernard. \"By the way,\" added he,  struck with a sudden idea, \"if you like, I can let you a furnished room,  the one you were to occupy, which has the furniture of my defaulting  tenant in it. Only you know that when rooms are let this way, you pay in  advance.\"    \"Well,\" said the artist, finding he could do no better, \"I should like  to know what you are going to ask me for your hole.\"    \"It is a very comfortable lodging, and the rent will be twenty-five  francs a month, considering the circumstances, paid in advance.\"    \"You have said that already, the expression does not deserve being  repeated,\" said the young man, feeling in his pocket. \"Have you change  for five hundred francs?\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" quoth the astonished landlord.    \"Five hundred, half a thousand; did you never see one before?\"  continued the artist, shaking the bank-note in "]]]
