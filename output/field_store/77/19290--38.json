Emily, you must listen.  This is Ermengarde St.  John, Emily.  Ermengarde, this is Emily.  Would you like to hold her?\"    \"Oh, may I?\" said Ermengarde.  \"May I, really?  She is beautiful!\" And  Emily was put into her arms.    Never in her dull, short life had Miss St. John dreamed of such an hour  as the one she spent with the queer new pupil before they heard the  lunch-bell ring and were obliged to go downstairs.    Sara sat upon the hearth-rug and told her strange things.  She sat  rather huddled up, and her green eyes shone and her cheeks flushed. She  told stories of the voyage, and stories of India; but what fascinated  Ermengarde the most was her fancy about the dolls who walked and  talked, and who could do anything they chose when the human beings were  out of the room, but who must keep their powers a secret and so flew  back to their places \"like lightning\" when people returned to the room.    \"WE couldn't do it,\" said Sara, seriously.  \"You see, it's a kind of  magic.\"    Once, when she was relating the story of the search for Emily,  Ermengarde saw her face suddenly change.  A cloud seemed to pass over  it and put out the light in her shining eyes.  She drew her breath in  so sharply that it made a funny, sad little sound, and then she shut  her lips and held them tightly closed, as if she was determined either  to do or NOT to do something. Ermengarde had an idea that if she had  been like any other little girl, she might have suddenly burst out  sobbing and crying. But she did not.    \"Have you a--a pain?\"  Ermengarde ventured.    \"Yes,\" Sara answered, after a moment's silence.  \"But it is not in my  body.\"  Then she added something in a low voice which she tried to keep  quite steady, and it was this:  \"Do you love your father more than  anything else in all the whole world?\"    Ermengarde's mouth fell open a little.  She knew that it would be far  from behaving like a respectable child at a select seminary to say that  it had never occurred to you that you COULD love your father, that you  would do anything desperate to avoid being left alone in his society  for ten minutes.  She was, indeed, greatly embarrassed.    \"I--I scarcely ever see him,\" she stammered.  \"He is always in the  library--reading things.\"    \"I love mine more than all the world ten times over,\" Sara said.  \"That  is what my pain is.  He has gone away.\"    She put her head quietly down on her little, huddled-up knees, and sat  very still for a few minutes.    \"She's going to cry out loud,\" thought Ermengarde, fearfully.    But she did not.  Her short, black locks tumbled about her ears, and  she sat still.  Then she spoke without lifting her head.    \"I promised him I would bear it,\" she said.  \"And I will.  You have to  bear things.  Think what soldiers bear!  Papa is a soldier. If there  was a war he would have to bear marching and thirstiness and, perhaps,  deep wounds.  And he would never say a word--not one word.\"    Ermengarde could only gaze at her, but she felt that she was beginning  to adore her.  She was so wonderful and different from anyone else.    Presently, she lifted her face and shook back her black locks, with a  queer little smile.    \"If I go on talking and talking,\" she said, \"and telling you things  about pretending, I shall bear it better.  You don't forget, but you  bear it better.\"    Ermengarde did not know why a lump came into her throat and her eyes  felt as if tears were in them.    \"Lavinia and Jessie are 'best friends,'\" she said rather huskily. \"I  wish we could be 'best friends.'  Would you have me for yours? You're  clever, and I'm the stupidest child in the school, but I--oh, I do so  like you!\"    \"I'm glad of that,\" said Sara.  \"It makes you thankful when you are  liked.  Yes.  We will be friends.  And I'll tell you what\"--a sudden  gleam lighting her face--\"I can help you with your French lessons.\"        4    Lottie      If Sara had been a different kind of child, the life she led at Miss  Minchin's Select Seminary for the next few years would not have been at  all good for her.  She was treated more as if she were a distinguished  guest at the establishment than as if she were a mere little girl. If  she had been a self-opinionated, domineering child, she might have  become disagreeable enough to be unbearable through being so much  indulged and flattered.  If she had been an indolent child, she would  have learned nothing.  Privately Miss Minchin disliked her, but she was  far too worldly a woman to do or say anything which might make such a  desirable pupil wish to leave her school. She knew quite well that if  Sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was uncomfortable or unhappy,  Captain Crewe would remove her at once. Miss Minchin's opinion was that  if a child were continually praised and never forbidden to do what she  liked, she would be sure to be fond of the place where she was so  treated.  Accordingly, Sara was praised for her quickness at her  lessons, for her good manners, for her amiability to her fellow pupils,  for her generosity if she gave sixpence to a beggar out of her full  little purse; the simplest thing she did was treated as if it were a  virtue, and if she had not had a disposition and a clever little brain,  she might have been a very self-satisfied young person.  But the clever  little brain told her a great many sensible and true things about  herself and her circumstances, and now and then she talked these things  over to Ermengarde as time went on.    \"Things happen to people by accident,\" she used to say.  \"A lot of nice  accidents have happened to me.  It just HAPPENED that I always liked  lessons and books, and could remember things when I learned them. It  just happened that I was born with a father who was beautiful and nice  and clever, and could give me everything I liked. Perhaps I have not  really a good temper at all, but if you have everything you want and  everyone is kind to you, how can you help but be good-tempered?  I  don't know\"--looking quite serious--\"how I shall ever find out whether  I am really a nice child or a horrid one. Perhaps I'm a HIDEOUS child,  and no one will ever know, just because I never have any trials.\"    \"Lavinia has no trials,\" said Ermengarde, stolidly, \"and she is horrid  enough.\"    Sara rubbed the end of her little nose reflectively, as she thought the  matter over.    \"Well,\" she said at last, \"perhaps--perhaps that is because Lavinia is  GROWING.\" This was the result of a charitable recollection of having  heard Miss Amelia say that Lavinia was growing so fast that she  believed it affected her health and temper.    Lavinia, in fact, was spiteful.  She was inordinately jealous of Sara.  Until the new pupil's arrival, she had felt herself the leader in the  school.  She had led because she was capable of making herself  extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her. She domineered  over the little children, and assumed grand airs with those big enough  to be her companions.  She was rather pretty, and had been the  best-dressed pupil in the procession when the Select Seminary walked  out two by two, until Sara's velvet coats and sable muffs appeared,  combined with drooping ostrich feathers, and were led by Miss Minchin  at the head of the line.  This, at the beginning, had been bitter  enough; but as time went on it became apparent that Sara was a leader,  too, and not because she could make herself disagreeable, but because  she never did.    \"There's one thing about Sara Crewe,\" Jessie had enraged her \"best  friend\" by saying honestly, \"she's never 'grand' about herself the  least bit, and you know she might be, Lavvie.  I believe I couldn't  help being--just a little--if I had so many fine things and was made  such a fuss over.  It's disgusting, the way Miss Minchin shows her off  when parents come.\"    \"'Dear Sara must come into the drawing room and talk to Mrs. Musgrave  about India,'\" mimicked Lavinia, in her most highly flavored imitation  of Miss Minchin.  \"'Dear Sara must speak French to Lady Pitkin. Her  accent is so perfect.'  She didn't learn her French at the Seminary, at  any rate.  And there's nothing so clever in her knowing it. She says  herself she didn't learn it at all.  She just picked it up, because she  always heard her papa speak it.  And, as to her papa, there is nothing  so grand in being an Indian officer.\"    \"Well,\" said Jessie, slowly, \"he's killed tigers.  He killed the one in  the skin Sara has in her room.  That's why she likes it so. She lies on  it and strokes its head, and talks to it as if it was a cat.\"    \"She's always doing something silly,\" snapped Lavinia.  \"My mamma says  that way of hers of pretending things is silly.  She says she will grow  up eccentric.\"    It was quite true that Sara was never \"grand.\"  She was a friendly  little soul, and shared her privileges and belongings with a free hand.  The little ones, who were accustomed to being disdained and ordered out  of the way by mature ladies aged ten and twelve, were never made to cry  by this most envied of them all.  She was a motherly young person, and  when people fell down and scraped their knees, she ran and helped them  up and patted them, or found in her pocket a bonbon or some other  article of a soothing nature. She never pushed them out of her way or  alluded to their years as a humiliation and a blot upon their small  characters.    \"If you are four you are four,\" she said severely to Lavinia on an  occasion of her having--it must be confessed--slapped Lottie and called  her \"a brat;\" \"but you will be five next year, and six the year after  that.  And,\" opening large, convicting eyes, \"it takes sixteen years to  make you twenty.\"    \"Dear me,\" said Lavinia, \"how we can calculate!\"  In fact, it was not  to be denied that sixteen and four made twenty--and twenty was an age"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14600"],[0,"Theory of Silk Weaving (#5)"],[1,"AND WIDTH OF THE FABRIC    To the length and width which the finished product is to have, we must add  a certain allowance for shrinkage and _taking up_ of warp during weaving.  It may differ from one to ten per cent., according to the texture and weave  of the fabric, and can be ascertained with sufficient accuracy by  stretching out and measuring a thread of warp and filling and comparing  their length with the respective measurements of the sample to be  reproduced.                                                                      [Page 69]  3. THE STOCK AND ITS DYE    Under this heading we must give the particulars as to nature, _twist_,  _quality_ and _size_ of the silk, and the directions for the dyeing,  whether _bright_ or _souple_, and in what colors, also whether to be  weighted or not.    The size is generally ascertained (in practical work) by comparing it with  other silk of which the exact count is known. Another method is to count  the number of cocoon threads which a thread of the sample contains, adding  to that 1/3 or 1/4, according to the quality of the silk; the result will be  the count in deniers. To obtain it in drams, divide the latter number by  17,3 as 1 dram is equal to 17,3 deniers.    Suppose we find 20 cocoon ends in a thread of silk: add 1/3, and we have  26-2/3 deniers, which, divided by 17,3 make 1,54 drams.    As silk is always more or less uneven, it is safer to count the cocoon  fibers of several threads and to take average thereof.    It requires the experience of years to judge with any degree of certainty  as to the origin and quality of silk, whether it be \"classical,\" \"extra,\"  \"sublime,\" etc.    There are machines wherewith to ascertain exactly the twist, that is, the  number of turns the silk has received in the throwing process.    In the dyeing we distinguish two great classes, of which the names  themselves give a good definition. \"Bright\" has a brilliant luster, while  \"souple\" has more of a dull, subdued appearance. To find out whether the  silk has been weighted in the dyeing process, we may compare it with other  silk of which the exact conditions are known, or we may burn a small  quantity of it. Unweighted silk does not burn readily and leaves a residue  of white ashes, while heavy weighted silk burns lively, leaving black,  charry ashes.                                                                      [Page 70]  4. REED CALCULATION    We count the number of repeats of the weave in a given space, generally 1/4  or 1/2 inch, and multiply this with the number of threads one repeat  contains, which gives us the reduction of the warp.    Suppose we had a taffeta, which, as we know, has only 2 ends to a repeat,  and counted 30 interlacings per 1/4 inch on one pick; we would have 60  threads per 1/4 inch or 240 per one inch. In this case the reed may be 80 by  3 or 60 by 4.    Another instance: In an 8-shaft satin we count 10 warp-threads, which bind  on the same pick in 1/4 inch; this, multiplied by 8, equals 80 ends per 1/4, or  320 per one inch; the reed will be an 80 with 4 in a dent or a 64 by 5.    In short, the number of the reed is found by dividing the number of  warp-threads that are to go in one dent, in the number of ends per inch.  Sometimes, the reed marks are clearly visible in a sample by holding the  latter against the light. Silk fabrics move with very few exceptions within  the limits of 50 and 90 dents per inch.    To learn the full number of dents required for the width of the cloth,  simply multiply the dents per one inch with the width, adding a certain  allowance for shrinkage. The edges, of course, must also be taken in  consideration, and very often the dents that are taken up by the latter are  used to counter-balance that shrinkage.    5. DRAWING-IN THE WARP IN HARNESS AND REED    Here we must specify the number of dents that contain the same number of  ends, and whether the latter are single or double, also the number of  shafts and the method of drawing-in.                                                                      [Page 71]  6. WARPING TICKET    To make out the warping ticket, we need to ascertain the total number of  ends, whether leased single or double, and the arrangement of the colors.    7. HARNESS ARRANGEMENT    This is governed by the number of ends to be drawn in and the necessary  shafts. If we have, for instance, 100 threads per inch to be drawn on 4  shafts, we must give each shaft 25 heddles per inch. There are generally  between 25 and 45 heddles per inch on one shaft.    8. REDUCTION OF THE FILLING    Here we state the number of picks per inch, give directions as to doubling,  if such is necessary, and if more than one color or shuttle is used, the  rotation thereof.    9. CALCULATION OF WARP AND FILLING    The system adopted in this country for specifying the size of silk is based  on the weight in drams (avoirdupois) of a skein containing 1000 yards. A  skein, thus weighing 5 drams, is technically called 5-dram silk. The number  of yards of 1-dram silk to a pound must accordingly be 256000. The formulas  for figuring the amount of silk required for a piece of cloth are as  follows:    Warp Calculation      _Multiply_:    Number of endsxlengthxcount                -----------------------------    _Divide by_:       1000 yardsx256 drams                                                                      [Page 72]  Filling Calculation      _Multiply:_     Picksxxplyxwidthxlength of piecexcount                   --------------------------------------  =  lbs.    _Divide by:_                1000 yardsx256 drams      The result in both cases will be in pounds.    The system of grading the silk which is in vogue in Europe, and which is  employed by a number of mills on this side, is as follows:         1 skein of 500 meters, weighing 0,05  grams = 1 denier international    or 1    \"     476   \"        \"     0,053   \"   = 1    \"   Turin system    or 1    \"     476   \"        \"     0,051   \"   = 1    \"   Milan    \"    The warp calculation, taking the international denier, would run:                          ends in warpxlengthxdenierx0,05 gram                       --------------------------------------      _divided by:_          500 meters      for the filling:    Picks per meterxxplyxwidthxdenierx0,05 gram                       ---------------------------------------------      _divided by:_             500 meters      Result in metric weight, kilograms and grams.    10. FINISHING    Give directions as to the process of finishing to which the goods are to be  subjected, whether to be pressed, calendered, sized, moired, etc.    11. CALCULATION OF COST    If all the foregoing conditions are ascertained, and a sample or a piece of  the fabric executed, it remains to the manufacturer to determine the exact  figure at which he can produce the article. That this must be done with  great accuracy is naturally of the utmost importance, and the calculator                                                                    [Page 73]  must know in the first place the raw stock prices, and also be acquainted  with the details of the manufacturing process and the rates of wages paid  therein. As a rule, the manufacturer establishes a scale of prices covering  all the items of labor cost, mill expenses, etc., and uses this as a basis  for his calculations.    A rule or formula for this operation cannot very well be given, as the  methods vary in almost every establishment, each choosing the one best  adapted to its ideas or dictates of circumstances and conditions.
