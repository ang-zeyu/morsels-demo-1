Two or three days passed, and we had entirely forgotten Ida's erratic  admirer, when Gabrielle returned from a morning walk with the  information that an intoxicated man was sitting upon the steps of the  side-hill house.  She met mamma and Ida starting for a little stroll,  and communicated this unpleasant news to them.  Mamma, however, is not  timid, and she walked on with Ida, determined to view the invader from  afar, and then summon Bernard to dismiss him.    A figure was sitting, as Gabrielle said, upon the piazza of the new  house, but was so motionless that Ida exclaimed laughingly:    \"It is a scarecrow placed there by some one in retaliation for our  notice to trespassers to keep off the grounds.\"    As they passed it, however, the scarecrow slowly lifted its head and  addressed them with:    \"Is this Mr. Greeley's place?\"    \"Yes,\" said mamma.    \"And is this young lady Miss Ida?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You have received, I believe, a few letters from me, Miss Ida: my name  is Hudson.\"    Fortunately our family are not of a fainting disposition, for a  _tete-a-tete_ with a lunatic was a situation requiring some nerve and  perfect self-control; so, although mamma and Ida were much alarmed upon  learning the name of their visitor, they neither screamed nor fainted,  and mamma invited him quite courteously to walk up to the house.    Mr. Hudson was a tall, powerful man, with cunning, restless, gray eyes,  was well dressed, and wore a linen duster.  He had come, he said, seven  hundred miles to see Ida.  Upon reaching the house, he followed mamma  into the dining-room where Marguerite, Gabrielle, and I were sitting at  work.    \"Ah, Miss Gabrielle!\" he said, \"I supposed you were at school.\"    One or two other rational remarks of the sort, and mamma's perfect  _sang-froid_ so deceived me that I decided the supposed lunatic must be  perfectly sane.  In a moment, however, he looked somewhat uneasy, and  said:    \"I have a long story to tell your niece, ma'am, but I feel a little  bashful about speaking before so many young ladies.\"    \"Would you like to see me alone, then?\" said mamma promptly; \"you would  not object to telling your story to a married woman.\"    Then signing to us to leave the room, she followed us to the door, and  _breathing_ rather than whispering, \"Run for Bernard,\" returned.    It appears that the man grew more excitable when alone with mamma, and  the story he told her was not a cheerful one to hear.    \"It began,\" he said, \"five years ago, by my father cutting his throat  with a razor.  They say he was crazy, and,\" with a fiendish chuckle,  \"some people say I am crazy too.\"    \"Indeed!\" said mamma, sympathetically, \"how sad!\"    \"This we may call the first scene in the story,\" he added, although  what connection there was between suicide and his proposed marriage  with Ida, poor mamma could not imagine.    I could half fill my journal with the rambling, senseless, and menacing  remarks that Hudson made to mamma, adding emphasis to his discourse by  whirling a pair of very long and sharp scissors close to her eyes (he  was further armed with two razors, we subsequently learnt).  Ida, he  said, first appeared to him in a vision--a beautiful young girl in  distress, who appealed to him for aid, but some one seemed to stand  between them--a tall woman dressed as a Sister of Charity (evidently  mamma, in her mourning dress and long crape veil).  He then enlarged  upon the awful punishment that inevitably overtook those who opposed  the Will of Providence (i.e., his marriage with Ida): death by some  violent means being unavoidable.  At this point, the scissors were  whirled more excitedly than ever, and Hudson's eyes glared with rage.  I need not say that mamma feared every moment would be her last; but  still preserving a calm exterior, she never took her eyes off him for  an instant, and merely remarking, \"It is quite warm here; shall we not  sit upon the piazza?\" accompanied him there, and sat down close beside  him, that he might not suspect she feared him.  The moments seemed  endless until Bernard's heavy tread was heard upon the kitchen stairs.    \"Excuse me a moment,\" said mamma, with a most innocent face; and in an  interview of _half_ a minute explained to Bernard that Hudson was a  dangerous lunatic who must be taken away immediately; then waiting till  the valorous Bernard was safely out on the piazza, she unceremoniously  shut and locked the door.  Hudson, apparently much surprised at such  inhospitable conduct, pulled the door-bell half a dozen times.  When he  was quite wearied with his exertions, Bernard suggested that they  should take a little walk together.  Much coaxing was requisite, for  Hudson was quite determined to effect an entrance; but finally Bernard  took his arm, and bore him off to the tavern.    \"I had much more to say to Mrs. Cleveland,\" he remarked, _en route_,  \"but I fear it has already been too much for her nerves.\"    At the tavern, Bernard found a constable, who immediately arrested the  unhappy victim of misplaced affection, and telegraphed to Mount Kisco  for a magistrate.  Then ensued endless hours of waiting.  Mamma lay  upon the sofa whiter than any ghost, now that the strain upon her  nerves was relaxed, and Mrs. L----, a loquacious neighbor, ran in from  time to time with reports of what people were saying, and how the  prisoner looked and felt.    At 7 P.M. the magistrate, Mr. Clarence Hyatt, arrived, and we all went  down to the improvised court-house in the tavern.  Ida and mamma were  shown into a private room, where Mr. Hyatt, a very polite and agreeable  gentleman, took their affidavits before they were confronted with the  enemy.  The news had by this time spread far and near, and all  Chappaqua was assembled.  The wildest reports were now circulated, to  the effect that Hudson had pointed a pistol at Ida, and vowed to kill  her instantly if she did not promise to marry him, and mamma and Ida  were advised to keep their veils down, that he might not become  familiar with their faces, and to remain at a respectful distance from  him.    Hudson was sitting between two constables, and was being inspected by a  large crowd.  He looked very quiet, and upon listening to the  affidavits, remarked that Mr. Hyatt must have misunderstood the ladies,  for he was perfectly incapable of having alarmed them to the extent  indicated; that he certainly admired Miss Ida, and desired to marry  her, but that he would not willingly injure or alarm the humblest  creature--adding reproachfully that those affidavits would suffice to  condemn him to State prison for life.  He appeared so perfectly  rational and calm, that the magistrate was perfectly dumbfoundered, and  for the moment thought him sane; and even we commenced to reproach  ourselves, and doubt which was the insane party.    \"Well,\" said Mr. Hyatt, \"I will now hear your story.\"    \"I will read it to you,\" said Hudson, drawing a book from his pocket,  and then commenced again the same incoherent nonsense with which he had  already favored mamma.  The object now was to show the chain of  evidence that pointed out Ida as his bride.  The most important link  was the fact that he had once seen a flock of white geese sailing  through the air.  He put up his finger, and one fluttered down to him;  and as G stood both for goose and Greeley, it was a clear manifestation  of the Divine Will (at this point, the audience burst into a roar of  laughter).  Besides, he liked our family, we suited him in every  respect; and especially because we so much reminded him of John the  Baptist (we inwardly hoped that the resemblance would not extend to  decapitation).  If Miss Greeley would not marry him, he kindly added,  he would take her cousin Marguerite instead, but he must positively  marry one of the family.  He was now perfectly wild, and when he  remarked, with a reproachful glance at Ida, that he disliked  _ko-kwettes_, and liked a girl who would say in answer to an offer,  \"Yes sir-ee,\" or \"No sir-ee,\" the magistrate brought the evidence to a  conclusion.  He gave him to the constable to be taken to the county  jail, where he was to be detained until the Court sat, if, in the  meantime, his relatives did not appear from Massachusetts to claim him  (for his place of residence varied--at first Baltimore, then Michigan,  it was now Massachusetts).    Hudson spent the night at the tavern, and appeared at times so  rational, that he was not strictly guarded; consequently, when the  constable looked for him after breakfast, the bird had flown.  He was  instantly followed, and discovered walking on the railway track about  two miles off, swinging his little bundle quite unconcernedly.  In  reply to the questions of his captors, he said that he had just  intended to make a little circuit about the country, and then return to  marry Ida.  He is now, thank fortune, safely lodged _in jail_.          CHAPTER IV.    A Visit from Papa--A Musical Squirrel--Letters--Croquet--Extracts from  Letters--Visitors--The Loss of the Missouri--The True Story of Ida's  Engagement.      _June 13_.    Papa came up late last night with a supply of the latest periodicals,  weekly journals, etc., and my pet squirrels in a new and spacious cage.  These little creatures were presents to me this spring, and are very  pretty, and partially tame.  I remember, however, one escapade of  theirs shortly before we left the city.    My balcony at home is enclosed with glass, and there I frequently  allowed the squirrels to play.  A game of _cache-cache_, of half an  hour or so, was generally necessary before I could induce Fliegende  Hollaender, the livelier of the pair, to return to the narrow limits of  his cage.  One day, however, through some carelessness, the door from  the balcony into "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18298"],[0,"Essays in Natural History and Agriculture (#5)"],[1,"ntry. The absurd and impracticable  clauses which were contained in the bill for the protection of the  fisheries, which was introduced into Parliament in 1825, show  this; yet notwithstanding this difficulty, I think it is possible  to protect the fish without interfering with the interest of the  mill-owners, and to make such laws on the subject as will be  effectual, without calling forth a single objection from any  unprejudiced person. I shall be glad if what I have said on this  subject should induce any gentleman to turn his attention to it.  There must be many whose opportunities of observation will enable  them to determine whatever is doubtful in the natural history of  the Salmon tribe; whose experience will teach them the defects and  absurdities of the present laws on the fisheries; and whose  influence will, if they can be induced to exert it, materially  contribute to their amendment.    CLITHEROE, _January_, 1834.    * * * * *    THE SALMON ENTERS AND ASCENDS RIVERS FOR OTHER PURPOSES BESIDES  PROPAGATION. [5]    In addition to the objections which I have offered to the seeming  doubt of Dr. Fleming, whether Salmon enter rivers for any other  purpose besides propagation, the following have come to mind; and  though they do not apply to the Salmon, they confirm me in the  opinion that there are reasons, of which we know nothing, for fish  ascending rivers, which are not at all connected with propagation.  One is the habit of what is here called streaming. In the winter  the fish not engaged in spawning (I speak of Trout, Grayling,  Chub, Dace, &c.) leave the streams and go into deep water; either  because the water is warmer there, or because they there find more  food; and it is well known to fly-fishers that they do not catch  many fish in the streams if they begin early, say in February. It  is proverbial here that fish begin to stream when the great grey,  or what is called in other districts the devil or dule crook, and  in March brown or brown drake, comes upon the water; and I have  seen Trout by scores leaping at a weir in the beginning of May,  whether in search of food or an instinct implanted in them to keep  all parts equally stocked with them, I do not know; but it has  certainly nothing to do with their spawning. Is it presumptuous to  suppose that God in His providence has implanted this instinct in  Salmon for our good, that we might have a supply of excellent  food, which without this would be in a great measure unattainable?  Whether this is the true cause, and the only one, I am unable to  determine; but this is the effect produced, and in the absence of  other reasons it is, in my opinion, one that ought to be admitted.  Another reason why fish ascend rivers is their impatience of heat.  I speak now more particularly of Grayling; if the weather is very  hot at the end of May or the beginning of June, the Grayling in  the Wharfe (they are almost unknown in this part of the Ribble)  ascend the mill streams by hundreds, and go up the wheel races as  far as they can get, and stay there until the stoppage of the  wheels (many a ducking have I had in pursuit of them), when they  are obliged to beat a retreat, and this often proves a disastrous  one to many of them. The ascent of young Eels by millions, and the  ascent of the Flounder, are neither of them connected with the  propagation of their kind, and though I cannot say for what  purposes they do ascend, I am, I think, justified in doubting  assertions which seem to have nothing to support them but the  positive manner in which they are made.    The Salmon Par is neither a Hybrid nor a distinct species of the  _genus Salmo_, but a state of the common Salmon. The author of  \"Wild Sports of the West\" says of the Par, as I have noted  previously, \"That it has very much the appearance of a Hybrid  between the Salmon and the Trout, and (in a note) that the natural  history of this fish is doubtful. Some conjecture that it is a  Hybrid between the Salmon and Trout, because it is only found in  rivers which are frequented by Salmon. Others think it a cross  breed between the sea Trout and river Trout,\" and then he speaks  of this \"hybridous diminutive,\" as if he thought one of these  opinions was correct. That the Par is not the result of a cross  between a sea Trout and a river Trout, is proved by the fact that  there are no sea Trouts in the Wharfe, the Par (admitting it to be  a distinct species, which I do not), the Salmon, and common Trout  being the only kinds of Salmonidae which are found in that river,  at least where I am acquainted with it. If the Par be the result  of a cross between the Salmon and the Trout, what becomes of it in  the spring, and where are all the Par, which were so abundant in  October, gone to in April? Did they migrate to the sea, the shoals  would be met with by somebody; and did they stay in the river they  would be caught at one time or other. However, as it is well known  that neither of these cases is ever realized, we must suppose  another, which I have already done in my former communication. In  fact, in angling in the beginning of March, fish are often caught  which would puzzle the most experienced fisherman to determine  whether they are Par or Smolts, especially after they have been  caught some time; and in a large number caught at that time there  are all the intermediate shades of appearance between the perfect  Par and the real blue Smolt.    CLITHEROE, _May 29th_, 1834.    * * * * *    CLITHEROE, _March 18th_, 1846.    TO MR. PAKINGTON (LORD HAMPTON).    SIR,--Through the polite attention of Mr. Cardwell I have been  favoured with a copy of your bill--\"For the better preservation of  Salmon.\" As this is a subject to which I have paid some attention,  I trust it will not be deemed impertinent if I offer some  suggestions for your consideration with regard to the free gap. It  appears to me that it will be desirable to specify the width and  depth of this free gap, or it may on the one hand degenerate into  a mouse-hole, or on the other hand the surveyor, by the provisions  of the 13th section of the Act, may insist on such a gap being  made that the whole of the water may be diverted through it, which  in small rivers, where there are ancient and legal hecks or  cruives for the purpose of taking Salmon, will destroy the value  of the fishery. Then, with regard to fence time:--In the 6th  section of the Act, I presume you do not intend that night fishing  shall be allowed at any season of the year; but it appears to me  that the expressions in the 6th section would scarcely prevent the  owners of cruives from keeping them open, as they need not go near  them between sunset and sunrise, and then they will neither lay,  draw, nor fish with any net, device, or engine. Would it not be  better to expressly insist upon all cruive fisheries being  positively closed from sunset to sunrise? or, what would be still  better, that the cruive or heck should have a free gap in it, of a  specified size, which should be kept constantly open between  sunset and sunrise. As this is one of the most important sections  of the Act, I may be pardoned for calling your particular  attention to it; for unless this section be vigorously enforced,  it will be in vain to legislate on the subject;--for the  proprietors near the sources of rivers (where most of the fish  spawn) will never interest themselves about the preservation of  fish which they are not allowed to see when in season, and which  has hitherto been the case in this neighbourhood at all events;  but if the fish are allowed a free passage everywhere, and at all  times, between sunset and sunrise, the upper proprietors will then  have some inducement to take care of the fish in the spawning  season. Until now, all the good fish have been taken in the  fisheries near the mouth of the river.    There is at present a great trade carried on in this neighbourhood  in Salmon roe, as a bait for Trout and Eels, and scores of  spawning Salmon are now destroyed for little else than the spawn  they contain. Cannot this be prevented?    * * * * *    _May 5th_, 1846.    H. GEORGE, ESQ.    SIR,--I enclose a letter I had addressed to Mr. Pakington on the  subject of the preservation of the breed of Salmon. I had written  to him because I perceived that he had introduced the bill into  the House of Commons, but since that letter was written I have  been favoured with your address through the politeness of Sir  Thomas Winnington, to a friend of mine, and as he requests that  any suggestion about weirs may be addressed to you, I make no  apology for enclosing the letter I had addressed to Mr. Pakington  with some further suggestions, which on looking over my letter I  find I have omitted to notice.    In one of the clauses of the bill (I do not remember which, and I  have not the bill at hand to refer to) you require that a grating,  the bars of which shall not be more than three inches distant from  each other, and which shall be placed at the junction of the tail-  goit with the river, as well as in front of the wheel. This I  presume is to prevent any fish being injured by the wheels, but I  assure you that during the twenty-two years in which I have had  the management of the works here, I never knew an instance of a  Salmon being either killed or hurt by the wheels. Indeed, I do not  know half-a-dozen instances of Salmon ever ascending the tail-goit  to the wheel, and I must have seen many instances if this was a  common occurrence. This may, however, happen, and the fish may be  occasionally injured where there is much fall lost, and a strong  stream running from a wheel constituted in the old way with open  float boards. But the objections to such a plan on the part of the  manufacturers will be insuperable, in fact, the accumulation of  sticks and leaves in the autumn, and ice in the winter, will be so  great at the grating in the tail-goit, that the wheels"]]]
