Do not move about in the boat,\" said Mr. Rose to  the young folks he was taking for a trip on the water.    2. The boat was a large one, and could not easily be upset. There were in  it Mr. and Mrs. Rose, the boatman, and several little boys and girls.    3. \"Keep still, please, young gentlemen,\" said the boatman, when Edgar  Rose and Thomas Read began to move from one side to the other.    4. They kept quiet for a short time only. Edgar soon wanted a stick which  Thomas held in his hand. He lost his balance in trying to get the stick,  and fell into the water.      [Illustration: Overturned boat, people clinging to boat and debris.  Another boat approaching.]      5. Mr. and Mrs. Rose both started up, and stretched out their arms to save  him; but in so doing, they upset the boat.    6. Every one fell into the water, and all were in the greatest danger of  being drowned.    7. Another boat was near, with but one man in it. He hastened to them as  quickly as possible, and saved them from drowning.    8. Children should always be careful and quiet when they are in a boat on  the water, and should obey what older people tell them.        LESSON XXXI.    MARY'S LETTER.

Brother Ed, in  trying to take a stick from Tom  Reed, tripped and fell out of the  boat. Papa and Mamma caught  at him to save him, and before  we knew it we were all in the  water. The boat upset and how  we were all saved I can hardly  tell. A man in another boat  which was near, picked us up.  Had it not been for this, you  would to-day have no cousin.

Unlike the lion, he runs so fast that the swiftest horse can not  overtake him. He goes over the ground by making bounds or springs, one  after another.    3. By night, as well as by day, the tiger watches for his prey. With a  frightful roar, he will seize a man, and carry him off.    4. Have you ever thought what use whiskers are to cats? Lions have great  whiskers, and so have tigers and all other animals of the cat kind.    5. Whenever you find an animal with whiskers like the cat's, you may be  sure that animal steals softly among branches and thick bushes.    6. By the slightest touch on the tiger's whiskers, he knows when there is  anything in his road.    7. A few years ago, some English officers went out to hunt. When coming  home from their day's sport, they found a little tiger kitten.    8. They took it with them and tied it, with a collar and chain, to the  pole of their tent. It played about, to the delight of all who saw it.    9. One evening, just as it was growing dark, they heard a sound that  frightened them greatly. It was the roar of a tiger.    10. The kitten pulled at the chain, and tried to break away. With a sharp  cry, it answered the voice outside.    11. All at once, a large tigress bounded into the middle of the tent. She  caught her kitten by the neck, and broke the chain which bound it.    12. Then turning to the door of the tent, she dashed away as suddenly as  she had come.

One winter night, Mrs. Lord and her two little girls sat by a bright  fire in their pleasant home. The girls were sewing, and their mother was  busy at her knitting.    [Illustration: Mother and two girls sewing under a lamp.]    2. At last, Katie finished her work, and, looking up, said, \"Mother, I  think the fire is brighter than usual. How I love to hear it crackle!\"    3. \"And I was about to say,\" cried Mary, \"that this is a better light than  we had last night.\"    4. \"My dears,\" said their mother, \"it must be that you feel happier than  usual to-night. Perhaps that is the reason why you think the fire better,  and the light brighter.\"    5. \"But, mother,\" said Mary, \"I do not see why we are happier now than we  were then; for last night cousin Jane was here, and we played 'Puss in the  corner' and 'Blind man' until we all were tired.\"    6. \"I know! I know why!\" said Katie. \"It is because we have all been doing  something useful to-night. We feel happy because we have been busy.\"    7. \"You are right, my dear,\" said their mother. \"I am glad you have both  learned that there may be something more pleasant than play, and, at the  same time, more instructive.\"        LESSON XXXIV.    dew'drops    hop'ping     la'zi est    bends    sung    pa'tience    in stead'    dar'ling     ought    rest    slum'ber     my self '    re ply'      miss     lose      BIRDIE'S MORNING SONG.    1.

Two fast friends were Willie Brown and his little dog Bounce. Willie  could never think of taking a walk without Bounce. Cake and play were  equally shared between them.    2. Willie taught his dog many cunning tricks, and often said that Bounce  could do almost anything in the world but talk.    3. There came a time, however, when Bounce really told Willie's father  something, though he could not talk. Let me tell you how he did this.    [Illustration: Boy and dog walking through forest.]    4. It was on a bright summer afternoon. Willie had strolled with Bounce  down to the river, which was not more than two blocks from his father's  store.    5. Willie began to throw stones into the water, and to watch the ripples  as they made one circle after another.    6. Bounce lay on the grass, watching the flies that buzzed around his  nose, and catching any that came too near.    7. There were some logs floating in the river near the shore. Willie  jumped upon one of them, to see if he could throw a stone across the  river.    8. He drew back, and sent the stone with all his might. just as it left  his hand, the log turned, and he fell into the water.    9. He was very much frightened, for he did not know how to swim, and there  was no one to hear, though he called as loud as he could for help.        LESSON XXXVI.    yelp      loud'ly    against    look'ing     bark'ing    spring    clothes    o'pened    dis'tress    scratched      WILLIE AND BOUNCE.  (CONCLUDED.)    1. Poor little Bounce gave a great yelp of distress. If he had been a big  water dog, he could have jumped in and brought his master out.    [Illustration: Boy in water clinging to log. Dog yelping.]    2. He ran up and down the bank two or three times, barking, looking first  at Willie and then around. Then he started, as fast as he could run, up  the street to the store.    3. When he got there the door was shut, but he scratched against it and  barked loudly, until some one came and opened it.    4. He caught hold of Mr. Brown's clothes, then ran to the door, then back  again, catching at him, barking, and jumping.    5. A friend who was in the store said to Mr. Brown, \"Something must be  wrong; I would put on my hat, and go with the dog.\" Bounce, seeing Mr.  Brown take his hat, started for the river.    6. Then Mr. Brown thought of Willie. As he came to the river, he saw  Willie's hat floating on the water, and his small arm thrown up.    7. He sprang in and caught him just as he was going down for the last  time, and quickly carried him to the bank. \"Willie soon got over his  fright, and no one seemed to be more delighted than Bounce.

With the  Pictish occupation would agree the fact that Irish Goidels called the  Picts who came to Ireland _Cruithne=Qritani=Pre-tani_. In Ireland they  almost certainly adopted Goidelic speech.    Whether or not all the Pictish invaders of Britain were called  \"Pictavi,\" this word or Picti, perhaps from _quicto_ (Irish _cicht_,  \"engraver\"),[37] became a general name for this people. _Q_ had been  changed into _p_ on the Continent; hence \"Pictavi\" or \"Pictones,\" \"the  tattooed men,\" those who \"engraved\" figures on their bodies, as the  Picts certainly did. Dispossessed and driven north by incoming Brythons  and Belgae, they later became the virulent enemies of Rome. In 306  Eumenius describes all the northern tribes as \"Caledonii and other  Picts,\" while some of the tribes mentioned by Ptolemy have Brythonic  names or names with Gaulish cognates. Place-names in the Pictish area,  personal names in the Pictish chronicle, and Pictish names like  \"Peanfahel,\"[38] have Brythonic affinities. If the Picts spoke a  Brythonic dialect, S. Columba's need of an interpreter when preaching to  them would be explained.[39] Later the Picts were conquered by Irish  Goidels, the Scotti. The Picts, however, must already have mingled with  aboriginal peoples and with Goidels, if these were already in Britain,  and they may have adopted their supposed non-Aryan customs from the  aborigines. On the other hand, the matriarchate seems at one time to  have been Celtic, and it may have been no more than a conservative  survival in the Pictish royal house, as it was elsewhere.[40] Britons,  as well as Caledonii, had wives in common.[41] As to tattooing, it was  practised by the Scotti (\"the scarred and painted men\"?), and the  Britons dyed themselves with woad, while what seem to be tattoo marks  appear on faces on Gaulish coins.[42] Tattooing, painting, and  scarifying the body are varieties of one general custom, and little  stress can be laid on Pictish tattooing as indicating a racial  difference. Its purpose may have been ornamental, or possibly to impart  an aspect of fierceness, or the figures may have been totem marks, as  they are elsewhere. Finally, the description of the Caledonii, a Pictish  people, possessing flaming hair and mighty limbs, shows that they  differed from the short, dark pre-Celtic folk.[43]    The Pictish problem must remain obscure, a welcome puzzle to  antiquaries, philologists, and ethnologists. Our knowledge of Pictish  religion is too scanty for the interpretation of Celtic religion to be  affected by it. But we know that the Picts offered sacrifice before  war--a Celtic custom, and had Druids, as also had the Celts.    The earliest Celtic \"kingdom\" was in the region between the upper waters  of the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Danube, where probably in Neolithic  times the formation of their Celtic speech as a distinctive language  began. Here they first became known to the Greeks, probably as a  semi-mythical people, the Hyperboreans--the folk dwelling beyond the  Ripoean mountains whence Boreas blew--with whom Hecataeus in the fourth  century identifies them. But they were now known as Celts, and their  territory as Celtica, while \"Galatas\" was used as a synonym of \"Celtae,\"  in the third century B.C.[44] The name generally applied by the Romans  to the Celts was \"Galli\" a term finally confined by them to the people  of Gaul.[45] Successive bands of Celts went forth from this  comparatively restricted territory, until the Celtic \"empire\" for some  centuries before 300 B.C. included the British Isles, parts of the  Iberian peninsula, Gaul, North Italy, Belgium, Holland, great part of  Germany, and Austria. When the German tribes revolted, Celtic bands  appeared in Asia Minor, and remained there as the Galatian Celts.  Archaeological discoveries with a Celtic _facies_ have been made in most  of these lands but even more striking is the witness of place-names.  Celtic _dunon_, a fort or castle (the Gaelic _dun_), is found in  compound names from Ireland to Southern Russia. _Magos_, \"a field,\" is  met with in Britain, France, Switzerland, Prussia, Italy, and Austria.  River and mountain names familiar in Britain occur on the Continent. The  Pennine range of Cumberland has the same name as the Appenines. Rivers  named for their inherent divinity, _devos_, are found in Britain and on  the Continent--Dee, Deva, etc.    Besides this linguistic, had the Celts also a political unity over their  great \"empire,\" under one head? Such a unity certainly did not prevail  from Ireland to the Balkan peninsula, but it prevailed over a large part  of the Celtic area. Livy, following Timagenes, who perhaps cited a lost  Celtic epos, speaks of king Ambicatus ruling over the Celts from Spain  to Germany, and sending his sister's sons, Bellovesus and Segovesus,  with many followers, to found new colonies in Italy and the Hercynian  forest.[46] Mythical as this may be, it suggests the hegemony of one  tribe or one chief over other tribes and chiefs, for Livy says that the  sovereign power rested with the Bituriges who appointed the king of  Celticum, viz. Ambicatus. Some such unity is necessary to explain Celtic  power in the ancient world, and it was made possible by unity of race or  at least of the congeries of Celticised peoples, by religious  solidarity, and probably by regular gatherings of all the kings or  chiefs. If the Druids were a Celtic priesthood at this time, or already  formed a corporation as they did later in Gaul, they must have  endeavoured to form and preserve such a unity. And if it was never so  compact as Livy's words suggest, it must have been regarded as an ideal  by the Celts or by their poets, Ambicatus serving as a central figure  round which the ideas of empire crystallised. The hegemony existed in  Gaul, where the Arverni and their king claimed power over the other  tribes, and where the Romans tried to weaken the Celtic unity by  opposing to them the Aedni.[47] In Belgium the hegemony was in the hands  of the Suessiones, to whose king Belgic tribes in Britain submitted.[48]  In Ireland the \"high king\" was supreme over other smaller kings, and in  Galatia the unity of the tribes was preserved by a council with regular  assemblies.[49]    The diffusion of the Ambicatus legend would help to preserve unity by  recalling the mythic greatness of the past. The Boii and Insubri  appealed to transalpine Gauls for aid by reminding them of the deeds of  their ancestors.[50] Nor would the Druids omit to infuse into their  pupils' minds the sentiment of national greatness. For this and for  other reasons, the Romans, to whom \"the sovereignty of all Gaul\" was an  obnoxious watch-word, endeavoured to suppress them.[51] But the Celts  were too widely scattered ever to form a compact empire.[52] The Roman  empire extended itself gradually in the consciousness of its power; the  cohesion of the Celts in an empire or under one king was made impossible  by their migrations and diffusion. Their unity, such as it was, was  broken by the revolt of the Teutonic tribes, and their subjugation was  completed by Rome. The dreams of wide empire remained dreams. For the  Celts, in spite of their vigour, have been a race of dreamers, their  conquests in later times, those of the spirit rather than of the mailed  fist. Their superiority has consisted in imparting to others their  characteristics; organised unity and a vast empire could never be  theirs.
