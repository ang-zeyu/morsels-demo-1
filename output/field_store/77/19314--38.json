As in a Bernard Shaw play, the preface may be the most important part  of this \"drama of nerves.\" Nor is the figure too far-fetched,  because, strange as it may seem, every neurosis is in essence a drama.  It has its conflict, its villain, and its victim, its love-story, its  practical joke, its climax, and its denouement. Sometimes the play  goes on forever with no solution, but sometimes psychotherapy steps in  as the fairy god-mother, to release the victim, outwit the villain,  and bring about the live-happily-ever-after ending.          PART II: \"HOW THE WHEELS GO ROUND\"          CHAPTER III    _In which we find a goodly inheritance_    THE STORY OF THE INSTINCTS    EACH IN HIS OWN TONGUE        A fire mist and a planet,      A crystal and a cell,      A jelly-fish and a saurian,      And caves where cavemen dwell;      Then a sense of law and beauty,      And a face turned from the clod;      Some call it evolution      And others call it God.[4]      If we begin at the beginning, we have to go back a long way to get our  start, for the roots of our family tree reach back over millions of  years. \"In the beginning--God.\" These first words of the book of  Genesis must be, in spirit at least, the first words of any discussion  of life. We know now, however, that when God made man, He did not  complete His masterpiece at one sitting, but instead devised a plan by  which the onward urge within and the environment without should act  and interact until from countless adaptations a human being was made.    [Footnote 4: William Herbert Carruth.]    As the late Dr. Putnam of Harvard University says, \"We stand as the  representative of a Creative Energy that expressed itself first in far  simpler forms of life and finally in the form of human instincts.\"[5]  And again: \"The choices and decisions of the organisms whose lives  prepared the way through eons of time for ours, present themselves to  us as instincts.\"[6]    [Footnote 5: Putnam: _Human Motives_, p. 32.]    [Footnote 6: Putnam: _Human Motives_, p. 18.]      INTRODUCING THE INSTINCTS    =Back of Our Dispositions.= What is it that makes the baby jump at a  noise? What energizes a man when you tell him he is a liar? What makes  a young girl blush when you look at her, or a youth begin to take  pains with his necktie? What makes men go to war or build tunnels or  found hospitals or make love or save for a home? What makes a woman  slave for her children, or give her life for them if need be?  \"Instinct\" you say, and rightly. Back of every one of these well-known  human tendencies is a specific instinct or group of instincts. The  story of the life of man and the story of the mind of man must begin  with the instincts. Indeed, any intelligent approach to human life,  whether it be that of the mother, the teacher, the preacher, the  social worker or the neurologist, leads back inevitably to the  instincts as the starting-point of understanding. But what is  instinct?    We are apt to be a bit hazy on that point, as we are on any  fundamental thing with which we intimately live. We reckon on these  instinctive tendencies every hour of the day, but as we are not used  to labeling them, it may help in the very beginning of our discussion  to have a list before our eyes. Here, then, is a list of the  fundamental tendencies of the human race and the emotions which drive  them to fulfilment.    THE SPECIFIC INSTINCTS AND THEIR EMOTIONS (AFTER MCDOUGALL)    _Instinct_             _Emotion_    Nutritive Instinct    Hunger  Flight                Fear  Repulsion             Disgust  Curiosity             Wonder  Self-assertion        Positive Self-feeling (Elation)  Self-abasement        Negative Self-feeling (Subjection)  Gregariousness        Emotion unnamed  Acquisition           Love of Possession  Construction          Emotion unnamed  Pugnacity             Anger  Reproductive Instinct Emotion unnamed  Parental Instinct     Tender Emotion    These are the fundamental tendencies or dispositions with which every  human being is endowed as he comes into the world. Differing in degree  in different individuals, they unite in varying proportions to form  various kinds of dispositions, but are in greater or less degree the  common property of us all.    There flows through the life of every creature a steady stream of  energy. Scientists have not been able to decide on a descriptive term  for this all-important life-force. It has been variously called  \"libido,\" \"vital impulse\" or \"elan vital,\" \"the spirit of life,\"  \"horme,\" and \"creative energy.\" The chief business of this life-force  seems to be the preservation and development of the individual and the  preservation and development of the race. In the service of these two  needs have grown up these habit-reactions which we call instincts. The  first ten of our list belong under the heading of self-preservation  and the last two under that of race-preservation. As hunger is the  most urgent representative of the self-preservative group, and as  reproduction and parental care make up the race-preservative group,  some scientists refer all impulses to the two great instincts of  nutrition and sex, using these words in the widest sense. However, it  will be useful for our purpose to follow McDougall's classification  and to examine individually the various tendencies of the two groups.    =In Debt to Our Ancestors.= An instinct is the result of the  experience of the race, laid in brain and nerve-cells ready for use.  It is a gift from our ancestors, an inheritance from the education of  the age-long line of beings who have gone before. In the struggle for  existence, it has been necessary for the members of the race to feed  themselves, to run away from danger, to fight, to herd together, to  reproduce themselves, to care for their young, and to do various other  things which make for the well-being or preservation of the race. The  individuals that did these things at the right time survived and  passed on to their offspring an inherited tendency to this kind of  reaction. McDougall defines an instinct as \"an inherited or innate  psycho-physical disposition which determines its possessor to perceive  or pay attention to objects of a certain class, to experience an  emotional excitement of a particular quality upon perceiving such an  object, and to act in regard to it in a particular manner, or at least  to experience an impulse to such action.\" This is just what an  instinct is,--an inherited disposition to notice, to feel, and to want  to act in certain ways in certain situations. It is the something  which makes us act when we cannot explain why, the something that goes  deeper than reason, and that links us to all other human  beings,--those who live to-day and those who have gone before.    It is true that East is East and West is West, but the two do meet in  the common foundation of our human nature. The likeness between men  and between races is far greater and far more fundamental than the  differences can ever be.    =Firing Up the Engine.= Purpose is writ large across the face of an  instinct, and that purpose is always toward action. Whenever a  situation arises which demands instantaneous action, the instinct is  the means of securing it. Planted within the creature is a tendency  which makes it perceive and feel and act in the appropriate way. It  will be noticed that there are three distinct parts to the process,  corresponding to intellect, emotion, will. The initial intellectual  part makes us sensitive to certain situations, makes us recognize an  object as meaningful and significant, and waves the flag for the  emotion; the emotion fires up the engine, pulls the levers all over  the body that release its energy and get it ready for action, and  pushes the button that calls into the mind an intense, almost  irresistible desire or impulse to act. Once aroused, the emotion and  the impulse are not to be changed. In man or beast, in savage or  savant, the intense feeling, the marked bodily changes, and the  yearning for action are identical and unchangeable. The brakes can be  put on and the action suppressed, but in that case the end of the  whole process is defeated. Could anything be plainer than that an  instinct and its emotion were never intended to be aroused except in  situations in which their characteristic action is to be desired? An  emotion is the hot part of an instinct and exists solely for securing  action. If all signs of the emotion are to be suppressed, all  expression denied, why the emotion?    But although the emotion and the impulse, once aroused, are beyond  control, there is yet one part of the instinct that is meant to be  controlled. The initial or receptive portion, that which notices a  situation, recognizes it as significant, and sends in the signal for  action, can be trained to discrimination. This is where reason comes  in. If the situation calls for flight, fear is in order; if it calls  for fight, anger is in order; if it calls for examination, wonder is  in order; but if it calls for none of these things, reason should show  some discrimination and refuse to call up the emotion.    =The Right of Way.= There is a law that comes to the aid of reason in  this dilemma and that is the \"law of the common path.\"[7] By this is  meant that man is capable of but one intense emotion at a time. No one  can imagine himself strenuously making love while he is shaken by an  agony of fear, or ravenously eating while he is in a passion of rage.  The stronger emotion gets the right of way, obtains control of mental  and bodily machinery, and leaves no room for opposite states. If the  two emotions are not antagonistic, they may blend together to form a  compound emotion, but if in the nature of the case such a blending is  impossible, the weaker is for the time being forgotten in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#5)"],[1,"nature of the four principles which are the generating causes of  all things, that they have equally divided among them the constituents  of all bodies; moreover, that earthy and humid bodies are carried at  equal angles by their own weight and ponderosity into the earth and  sea; that the other two parts consist, one of fire, and the other of  air? As the two former are carried by their gravity and weight into the  middle region of the world, so these, on the other hand, ascend by  right lines into the celestial regions, either because, owing to their  intrinsic nature, they are always endeavoring to reach the highest  place, or else because lighter bodies are naturally repelled by  heavier; and as this is notoriously the case, it must evidently follow  that souls, when once they have departed from the body, whether they  are animal (by which term I mean capable of breathing) or of the nature  of fire, must mount upward. But if the soul is some number, as some  people assert, speaking with more subtlety than clearness, or if it is  that fifth nature, for which it would be more correct to say that we  have not given a name to than that we do not correctly understand  it--still it is too pure and perfect not to go to a great distance from  the earth. Something of this sort, then, we must believe the soul to  be, that we may not commit the folly of thinking that so active a  principle lies immerged in the heart or brain; or, as Empedocles would  have it, in the blood.    XVIII. We will pass over Dicaearchus,[11] with his contemporary and  fellow-disciple Aristoxenus,[12] both indeed men of learning. One of  them seems never even to have been affected with grief, as he could not  perceive that he had a soul; while the other is so pleased with his  musical compositions that he endeavors to show an analogy betwixt them  and souls. Now, we may understand harmony to arise from the intervals  of sounds, whose various compositions occasion many harmonies; but I do  not see how a disposition of members, and the figure of a body without  a soul, can occasion harmony. He had better, learned as he is, leave  these speculations to his master Aristotle, and follow his own trade as  a musician. Good advice is given him in that Greek proverb,        Apply your talents where you best are skill'd.    I will have nothing at all to do with that fortuitous concourse of  individual light and round bodies, notwithstanding Democritus insists  on their being warm and having breath, that is to say, life. But this  soul, which is compounded of either of the four principles from which  we assert that all things are derived, is of inflamed air, as seems  particularly to have been the opinion of Panaetius, and must necessarily  mount upward; for air and fire have no tendency downward, but always  ascend; so should they be dissipated that must be at some distance from  the earth; but should they remain, and preserve their original state,  it is clearer still that they must be carried heavenward, and this  gross and concrete air, which is nearest the earth, must be divided and  broken by them; for the soul is warmer, or rather hotter, than that  air, which I just now called gross and concrete: and this may be made  evident from this consideration--that our bodies, being compounded of  the earthy class of principles, grow warm by the heat of the soul.    XIX. We may add, that the soul can the more easily escape from this  air, which I have often named, and break through it, because nothing is  swifter than the soul; no swiftness is comparable to the swiftness of  the soul, which, should it remain uncorrupt and without alteration,  must necessarily be carried on with such velocity as to penetrate and  divide all this atmosphere, where clouds, and rain, and winds are  formed, which, in consequence of the exhalations from the earth, is  moist and dark: but, when the soul has once got above this region, and  falls in with, and recognizes, a nature like its own, it then rests  upon fires composed of a combination of thin air and a moderate solar  heat, and does not aim at any higher flight; for then, after it has  attained a lightness and heat resembling its own, it moves no more, but  remains steady, being balanced, as it were, between two equal weights.  That, then, is its natural seat where it has penetrated to something  like itself, and where, wanting nothing further, it may be supported  and maintained by the same aliment which nourishes and maintains the  stars.    Now, as we are usually incited to all sorts of desires by the stimulus  of the body, and the more so as we endeavor to rival those who are in  possession of what we long for, we shall certainly be happy when, being  emancipated from that body, we at the same time get rid of these  desires and this rivalry. And that which we do at present, when,  dismissing all other cares, we curiously examine and look into  anything, we shall then do with greater freedom; and we shall employ  ourselves entirely in the contemplation and examination of things;  because there is naturally in our minds a certain insatiable desire to  know the truth, and the very region itself where we shall arrive, as it  gives us a more intuitive and easy knowledge of celestial things, will  raise our desires after knowledge. For it was this beauty of the  heavens, as seen even here upon earth, which gave birth to that  national and hereditary philosophy (as Theophrastus calls it), which  was thus excited to a desire of knowledge. But those persons will in a  most especial degree enjoy this philosophy, who, while they were only  inhabitants of this world and enveloped in darkness, were still  desirous of looking into these things with the eye of their mind.    XX. For if those men now think that they have attained something who  have seen the mouth of the Pontus, and those straits which were passed  by the ship called Argo, because,        From Argos she did chosen men convey,      Bound to fetch back the Golden Fleece, their prey;    or those who have seen the straits of the ocean,        Where the swift waves divide the neighboring shores      Of Europe, and of Afric;    what kind of sight do you imagine that will be when the whole earth is  laid open to our view? and that, too, not only in its position, form,  and boundaries, nor those parts of it only which are habitable, but  those also that lie uncultivated, through the extremities of heat and  cold to which they are exposed; for not even now is it with our eyes  that we view what we see, for the body itself has no senses; but (as  the naturalists, ay, and even the physicians assure us, who have opened  our bodies, and examined them) there are certain perforated channels  from the seat of the soul to the eyes, ears, and nose; so that  frequently, when either prevented by meditation, or the force of some  bodily disorder, we neither hear nor see, though our eyes and ears are  open and in good condition; so that we may easily apprehend that it is  the soul itself which sees and hears, and not those parts which are, as  it were, but windows to the soul, by means of which, however, she can  perceive nothing, unless she is on the spot, and exerts herself. How  shall we account for the fact that by the same power of thinking we  comprehend the most different things--as color, taste, heat, smell, and  sound--which the soul could never know by her five messengers, unless  every thing were referred to her, and she were the sole judge of all?  And we shall certainly discover these things in a more clear and  perfect degree when the soul is disengaged from the body, and has  arrived at that goal to which nature leads her; for at present,  notwithstanding nature has contrived, with the greatest skill, those  channels which lead from the body to the soul, yet are they, in some  way or other, stopped up with earthy and concrete bodies; but when we  shall be nothing but soul, then nothing will interfere to prevent our  seeing everything in its real substance and in its true character.    XXI. It is true, I might expatiate, did the subject require it, on the  many and various objects with which the soul will be entertained in  those heavenly regions; when I reflect on which, I am apt to wonder at  the boldness of some philosophers, who are so struck with admiration at  the knowledge of nature as to thank, in an exulting manner, the first  inventor and teacher of natural philosophy, and to reverence him as a  God; for they declare that they have been delivered by his means from  the greatest tyrants, a perpetual terror, and a fear that molested them  by night and day. What is this dread--this fear? What old woman is  there so weak as to fear these things, which you, forsooth, had you not  been acquainted with natural philosophy, would stand in awe of?        The hallow'd roofs of Acheron, the dread      Of Orcus, the pale regions of the dead.    And does it become a philosopher to boast that he is not afraid of  these things, and that he has discovered them to be false? And from  this we may perceive how acute these men were by nature, who, if they  had been left without any instruction, would have believed in these  things. But now they have certainly made a very fine acquisition in  learning that when the day of their death arrives, they will perish  entirely. And if that really is the case--for I say nothing either  way--what is there agreeable or glorious in it? Not that I see any  reason why the opinion of Pythagoras and Plato may not be true; but  even although Plato were to have assigned no reason for his opinion  (observe how much I esteem the man), the weight of his authority would  have borne me down; but he has brought so many reasons, that he appears  to me to have endeavored to convince others, and certainly to have  convinced himself.    XXII. But there are many who labor on the other side of the question,  and condemn souls to death, as if they were"]]]
