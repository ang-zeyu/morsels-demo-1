I shouted to him as  loudly as I could, but the uproar was so terrific that he could not  hear a word, and there was nothing for it but to try and make my own  way home. The darkness was profound. As I was walking carefully along,  I suddenly came in contact with an object, which a timely flash of  lightning showed me was a column, standing in exactly the opposite  direction from my own house. I could now locate myself correctly, and  the lightning becoming every moment more vivid, I was enabled to grope  my way by slow degrees to the mess, where I expected to find someone  to show me my way home, but the servants, who knew from experience the  probable effects of a cyclone, had already closed the outside Venetian  shutters and barred all the doors. I could just see them through the  cracks engaged in making everything fast. In vain I banged at the door  and called at the top of my voice--they heard nothing. Reluctantly I  became convinced that there was no alternative but to leave my shelter  and face the rapidly increasing storm once more. My bungalow was not  more than half a mile away, but it took me an age to accomplish this  short distance, as I was only able to move a few steps at a time  whenever the lightning showed me the way. It was necessary to be  careful, as the road was raised, with a deep ditch on either side;  several trees had already been blown down, and lay across it, and huge  branches were being driven through the air like thistle-down. I found  extreme difficulty in keeping my feet, especially at the cross-roads,  where I was more than once all but blown over. At last I reached my  house, but even then my struggles were not quite at an end. It was a  very long time before I could gain admittance. The servant who had  been carrying the lantern had arrived, and, missing me, imagined that  I must have returned to the house at which I had dined. The men with  whom I chummed, thinking it unlikely that I should make a second  attempt to return home, had carefully fastened all the doors,  momentarily expecting the roof of the house to be blown off. I had to  continue hammering and shouting for a long time before they heard and  admitted me, thankful to be comparatively safe inside a house.    By morning the worst of the storm was over, but not before great  damage had been done. The Native bazaar was completely wrecked,  looking as if it had suffered a furious bombardment, and great havoc  had been made amongst the European houses, not a single verandah or  outside shutter being left in the station. As I walked to the mess, I  found the road almost impassable from fallen trees; and dead birds,  chiefly crows and kites, were so numerous that they had to be carried  off in cartloads. How I had made my way to my bungalow without  accident the night before was difficult to imagine. Even the column  against which I had stumbled was levelled by the fury of the blast.  This column had been raised a few years before to the memory of  the officers and men of the 1st Troop, 1st Brigade, Bengal Horse  Artillery, who were killed in the disastrous retreat from Kabul in  1841. It was afterwards rebuilt.    Dum-Dum in ruins was even more dreary than before the cyclone, and I  felt as if I could not possibly continue to live there much longer.  Accordingly I wrote to my father, begging him to try and get me sent  to Burma; but he replied that he hoped soon to get command of the  Peshawar division, and that he would then like me to join him. Thus,  though my desire to quit Dum-Dum was not to be immediately gratified,  I was buoyed up by the hope that a definite limit had now been placed  to my service in that, to me, uninteresting part of India, and my  restlessness and discontent disappeared as if by magic.    In time of peace, as in war, or during a cholera epidemic, a soldier's  moral condition is infinitely more important than his physical  surroundings, and it is in this respect, I think, that the subaltern  of the present day has an advantage over the youngster of forty years  ago. The life of a young officer during his first few months of exile,  before he has fallen into the ways of his new life and made friends  for himself, can never be very happy; but in these days he is  encouraged by the feeling that, however distasteful, it need not  necessarily last very long; and he can look forward to a rapid and  easy return to England and friends at no very distant period. At the  time I am writing of he could not but feel completely cut off from all  that had hitherto formed his chief interests in life--his family  and his friends--for ten years is an eternity to the young, and the  feeling of loneliness and home-sickness was apt to become almost  insupportable.    The climate added its depressing influence; there was no going to the  hills then, and as the weary months dragged on, the young stranger  became more and more dispirited and hopeless. Such was my case. I had  only been four months in India, but it seemed like four years. My joy,  therefore, was unbounded when at last my marching orders arrived.  Indeed, the idea that I was about to proceed to that grand field of  soldierly activity, the North-West Frontier, and there join my father,  almost reconciled me to the disappointment of losing my chance of  field service in Burma. My arrangements were soon made, and early in  August I bade a glad good-bye to Dum-Dum.      [Footnote 1: In the fifty-seven years preceding the Mutiny the annual  rate of mortality amongst the European troops in India was sixty-nine  per thousand, and in some stations it was even more appalling. The  Royal Commission appointed in 1864 to inquire into the sanitary  condition of the army in India expressed the hope that, by taking  proper precautions, the mortality might be reduced to the rate of  twenty per thousand per annum. I am glad to say that this hope has  been more than realized, the annual death-rate since 1882 having never  risen to seventeen per thousand.]           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER II.  1852    Bengal Horse Artillery--Incidents of the journey--New Friends      When I went to India the mode of travelling was almost as primitive  as it had been a hundred, and probably five hundred, years before.  Private individuals for the most part used palankins, while officers,  regiments, and drafts were usually sent up country by the river route  as far as Cawnpore. It was necessarily a slow mode of progression--how  slow may be imagined from the fact that it took me nearly three months  to get from Dum-Dum to Peshawar, a distance now traversed with the  greatest ease and comfort in as many days. As far as Benares I  travelled in a barge towed by a steamer--a performance which took the  best part of a month to accomplish. From Benares to Allahabad it was a  pleasant change to get upon wheels, a horse-dak having been recently  established between these two places. At Allahabad I was most kindly  received by Mr. Lowther, the Commissioner, an old friend of my  father's, in whose house I experienced for the first time that profuse  hospitality for which Anglo-Indians are proverbial. I was much  surprised and amused by the circumstance of my host smoking a _hookah_  even at meals, for he was one of the few Englishmen who still indulged  in that luxury, as it was then considered. The sole duty of one  servant, called the _hookah-bardar_, was to prepare the pipe for his  master, and to have it ready at all times.    My next resting-place was Cawnpore, my birthplace, where I remained  a few days. The Cawnpore division was at that time commanded by an  officer of the name of Palmer, who had only recently attained the  rank of Brigadier-General, though he could not have been less than  sixty-eight years of age, being of the same standing as my father.    From Cawnpore I went to Meerut, and there came across, for the first  time, the far-famed Bengal Horse Artillery, and made the acquaintance  of a set of officers who more than realized my expectations regarding  the wearers of the much-coveted jacket, association with whom created  in me a fixed resolve to leave no stone unturned in the endeavour to  become a horse gunner. Like the Cavalry and Infantry of the East India  Company's service, the Artillery suffered somewhat from the employment  of many of its best officers on the staff and in civil appointments;  the officers selected were not seconded or replaced in their  regiments. This was the case in a less degree, no doubt, in the Horse  Artillery than in the other branches, for its _esprit_ was great, and  officers were proud to belong to this _corps d'elite_. It certainly  was a splendid service; the men were the pick of those recruited by  the East India Company, they were of magnificent physique, and their  uniform was singularly handsome. The jacket was much the same as that  now worn by the Royal Horse Artillery, but instead of the busby they  had a brass helmet covered in front with leopard skin, surmounted by  a long red plume which drooped over the back like that of a French  Cuirassier. This, with white buckskin breeches and long boots,  completed a uniform which was one of the most picturesque and  effective I have ever seen on a parade-ground.    The metalled highway ended at Meerut, and I had to perform the  remainder of my journey to Peshawar, a distance of 600 miles, in a  palankin, or doolie.    This manner of travelling was tedious in the extreme. Starting after  dinner, the victim was carried throughout the night by eight men,  divided into reliefs of four. The whole of the eight were changed at  stages averaging from ten to twelve miles apart. The baggage was  also conveyed by coolies, who kept up an incessant chatter, and the  procession was lighted on its way by a torch-bearer, whose torch  consisted of bits of rag tied round the end of a stick, upon which  he continually poured the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1653"],[0,"The Imitation of Christ (#5)"],[1,"d.  For man proposeth, but God disposeth; and the way of a  man is not in himself.(1)    3. If a holy exercise be sometimes omitted for the sake of some  act of piety, or of some brotherly kindness, it can easily be  taken up afterwards; but if it be neglected through distaste or  slothfulness, then is it sinful, and the mischief will be felt.  Strive as earnestly as we may, we shall still fall short in many  things.  Always should some distinct resolution be made by us;  and, most of all, we must strive against those sins which most  easily beset us.  Both our outer and inner life should be  straitly examined and ruled by us, because both have to do with  our progress.    4. If thou canst not be always examining thyself, thou canst at  certain seasons, and at least twice in the day, at evening and at  morning.  In the morning make thy resolves, and in the evening  inquire into thy life, how thou hast sped to-day in word, deed,  and thought; for in these ways thou hast often perchance offended  God and thy neighbour.  Gird up thy lions like a man against the  assaults of the devil; bridle thine appetite, and thou wilt soon  be able to bridle every inclination of the flesh.  Be thou never  without something to do; be reading, or writing, or praying, or  meditating, or doing something that is useful to the community.  Bodily exercises, however, must be undertaken with discretion,  nor are they to be used by all alike.    5. The duties which are not common to all must not be done  openly, but are safest carried on in secret.  But take heed that  thou be not careless in the common duties, and more devout in the  secret; but faithfully and honestly discharge the duties and  commands which lie upon thee, then afterwards, if thou hast still  leisure, give thyself to thyself as thy devotion leadeth thee.  All cannot have one exercise, but one suiteth better to this man  and another to that.  Even for the diversity of season different  exercises are needed, some suit better for feasts, some for  fasts.  We need one kind in time of temptations and others in  time of peace and quietness. Some are suitable to our times of  sadness, and others when we are joyful in the Lord.    6. When we draw near the time of the great feasts, good exercises  should be renewed, and the prayers of holy men more fervently  besought.  We ought to make our resolutions from one Feast to  another, as if each were the period of our departure from this  world, and of entering into the eternal feast.  So ought we to  prepare ourselves earnestly at solemn seasons, and the more  solemnly to live, and to keep straightest watch upon each holy  observance, as though we were soon to receive the reward of our  labours at the hand of God.    7. And if this be deferred, let us believe ourselves to be as yet  ill-prepared, and unworthy as yet of the glory which shall be  revealed in us at the appointed season; and let us study to  prepare ourselves the better for our end.  Blessed is that  servant, as the Evangelist Luke hath it, whom, when the Lord  cometh He shall find watching.  Verily I say unto you He will  make him ruler over all that He hath.(2)    (1) Jeremiah x. 23.   (2) Luke xii. 43, 44.      CHAPTER XX    Of the love of solitude and silence    Seek a suitable time for thy meditation, and think frequently of  the mercies of God to thee.  Leave curious questions.  Study such  matters as bring thee sorrow for sin rather than amusement.  If  thou withdraw thyself from trifling conversation and idle goings  about, as well as from novelties and gossip, thou shalt find thy  time sufficient and apt for good meditation.  The greatest saints  used to avoid as far as they could the company of men, and chose  to live in secret with God.    2. One hath said, \"As oft as I have gone among men, so oft have I  returned less a man.\"  This is what we often experience when we  have been long time in conversation.  For it is easier to be  altogether silent than it is not to exceed in word.  It is easier  to remain hidden at home than to keep sufficient guard upon  thyself out of doors.  He, therefore, that seeketh to reach that  which is hidden and spiritual, must go with Jesus \"apart from the  multitude.\"  No man safely goeth abroad who loveth not to rest at  home.  No man safely talketh but he who loveth to hold his peace.  No man safely ruleth but he who loveth to be subject.  No man  safely commandeth but he who loveth to obey.    3. No man safely rejoiceth but he who hath the testimony of a  good conscience within himself.  The boldness of the Saints was  always full of the fear of God.  Nor were they the less earnest  and humble in themselves, because they shone forth with great  virtues and grace.  But the boldness of wicked men springeth from  pride and presumption, and at the last turneth to their own  confusion.  Never promise thyself security in this life,  howsoever good a monk or devout a solitary thou seemest.    4. Often those who stand highest in the esteem of men, fall the  more grievously because of their over great confidence.  Wherefore it is very profitable unto many that they should not be  without inward temptation, but should be frequently assaulted,  lest they be over confident, lest they be indeed lifted up into  pride, or else lean too freely upon the consolations of the  world.  O how good a conscience should that man keep, who never  sought a joy that passeth away, who never became entangled with  the world!  O how great peace and quiet should he possess, who  would cast off all vain care, and think only of healthful and  divine things, and build his whole hope upon God!    5. No man is worthy of heavenly consolation but he who hath  diligently exercised himself in holy compunction.  If thou wilt  feel compunction within thy heart, enter into thy chamber and  shut out the tumults of the world, as it is written, Commune with  your own heart in your own chamber and be still.(1)  In  retirement thou shalt find what often thou wilt lose abroad.  Retirement, if thou continue therein, groweth sweet, but if thou  keep not in it, begetteth weariness.  If in the beginning of thy  conversation thou dwell in it and keep it well, it shall  afterwards be to thee a dear friend, and a most pleasant solace.    6. In silence and quiet the devout soul goeth forward and  learneth the hidden things of the Scriptures.  Therein findeth  she a fountain of tears, wherein to wash and cleanse herself each  night, that she may grow the more dear to her Maker as she  dwelleth the further from all worldly distraction.  To him who  withdraweth himself from his acquaintance and friends God with  his holy angels will draw nigh.  It is better to be unknown and  take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself and work wonders.  It is praiseworthy for a religious man to go seldom abroad, to  fly from being seen, to have no desire to see men.    7. Why wouldest thou see what thou mayest not have?  The world  passeth away and the lust thereof.  The desires of sensuality  draw thee abroad, but when an hour is past, what dost thou bring  home, but a weight upon thy conscience and distraction of heart?  A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a  merry evening maketh a sad morning?  So doth all carnal joy  begin pleasantly, but in the end it gnaweth away and destroyeth.  What canst thou see abroad which thou seest not at home?  Behold  the heaven and the earth and the elements, for out of these are  all things made.    8. What canst thou see anywhere which can continue long under the  sun?  Thou believest perchance that thou shalt be satisfied, but  thou wilt never be able to attain unto this.  If thou shouldest  see all things before thee at once, what would it be but a vain  vision?  Lift up thine eyes to God on high, and pray that thy  sins and negligences may be forgiven.  Leave vain things to vain  men, and mind thou the things which God hath commanded thee.  Shut thy door upon thee, and call unto thyself Jesus thy beloved.  Remain with Him in thy chamber, for thou shalt not elsewhere find  so great peace.  If thou hadst not gone forth nor listened to  vain talk, thou hadst better kept thyself in good peace.  But  because it sometimes delighteth thee to hear new things, thou  must therefore suffer trouble of heart.    (1) Psalm iv. 4.      CHAPTER XXI    Of compunction of heart    If thou wilt make any progress keep thyself in the fear of God,  and long not to be too free, but restrain all thy senses under  discipline and give not thyself up to senseless mirth.  Give  thyself to compunction of heart and thou shalt find devotion.  Compunction openeth the way for many good things, which  dissoluteness is wont quickly to lose.  It is wonderful that any  man can ever rejoice heartily in this life who considereth and  weigheth his banishment, and the manifold dangers which beset his  soul.    2. Through lightness of heart and neglect of our shortcomings we  feel not the sorrows of our soul, but often vainly laugh when we  have good cause to weep.  There is no true liberty nor real joy,  save in the fear of God with a good conscience.  Happy is he who  can cast away every cause of distraction and bring himself to the  one purpose of holy compunction.  Happy is he who putteth away  from him whatsoever may stain or burden his conscience.  Strive  manfully; custom is overcome by custom.  If thou knowest how to  let men alone, they will gladly let thee alone to do thine own  works.    3. Busy not thyself with the affairs of others, nor entangle  thyself with the business of great men.  Keep always thine eye  upon thyself first of all, and give advice to thyself specially  before all thy dearest friends.  If thou hast not the favour of  men, be not thereby cast down, but let thy concern be that thou  holdest not thyself so well and circumspectly, as becometh a  servant of God and a devout monk.  It is often better and safer  for a man not to have many comforts in"]]]
