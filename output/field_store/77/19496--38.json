Many of the Austrian  soldiers, it  is said, dropped  by the way  from fatigue and  weakness, as  they had had  neither food nor rest,  and several of the  officers did the  same. It  was impossible for some  parts of the  army to make a  stand, as  their artillery had been obliged to  remain behind owing to the exhaustion  of  the horses.  Only  those of  the Austrian  regiments  which had  their  supply-wagons with them were able to reach the Bosnian frontier.          __________________________________________________________________________  26--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: A GERMAN POSSESSION ADDED TO THE BRITISH EMPIRE BY THE  AUSTRALIAN FORCES: THE OCCUPATION OF NEU POMMERN (NEW BRITAIN).]    The Admiralty announced  on September 13 that the  Australian Squadron had  occupied,  on the  11th,  \"the  town of  Herbertshoehe,  in  the island  of  Neu  Pommern (late  New  Britain),  which is  an  island  in the  Bismarck  Archipelago; this island lies due east from German New Guinea.\" At Rabaul,  New Britain, on the 13th, a  British Proclamation was read, with a special  one in \"pidgin\"  English for the natives.

The motive was to maintain the neutrality  and independence of the three peoples, and at the same time to mitigate as  far as  possible the serious  inconveniences which all the  three Northern  States have suffered in regard to  the supplies of the necessaries of life  and in their general economic condition in consequence of the existence of  a state of war in Europe.--[_Photos. by Russell, Florman, and Bieber._]          __________________________________________________________________________  28--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: THE ENEMY AS PORTRAYED BY HIMSELF ON CHALK: THE GERMAN  SOLDIER-CAVEMAN AS ARTIST IN THE AISNE QUARRIES.]    In  more ways  than one,  the  German soldier  would seem  on occasion  to  represent, as  it were,  a reverting  to primitive  type: to  the barbaric  European  of  centuries  back  in the  world's  history.  The  \"reversion\"  takes  many shapes,  and  we have  seen  instances of  it  during the  war  in  various ways.  It  is  surely readily  recognisable,  for example,  in  that  spirit  of  sheer   ruthlessness  which  inspired  the  perpetration  of  the  inhuman  outrages  that  have laid  Belgium  waste,  and  of  the  killing of  harmless women and  children by  naval shells at  the peaceful  watering-place  of  Scarborough.  Another   and  more  innocuous  form  of  going  back to  the  habits  and methods  typical  of  primitive man,  is,  perhaps,  traceable  in  the  illustrations given  above.  They  are  some  of  the handiwork  of  the twentieth-century  German  military cavemen  of                                                        [_Continued opposite._          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--29      [Illustration: THE ENEMY AS PORTRAYED BY HIMSELF ON CHALK: THE GERMAN  SOLDIER-CAVEMAN AS ARTIST IN THE AISNE QUARRIES.]    _Continued._]    the Aisne battlefield,  while making use of the cover  of the quarries and  natural excavations of the district along  the northern side of the river.  In very much the same way, as modern exploration has brought to light, the  primaeval cave-dwelling  inhabitants of  Europe in prehistoric  times left  rudimentary traces  of their presence  in certain  places in the  shape of  carvings and roughly  painted \"portraits\" of themselves,  of the creatures  they  hunted  for  food  and  fought with,  and  of  the  implements  they  used.  According to  the  German  newspaper from  which  we reproduce  the  illustrations given here, they are the work of a German artist who has had  to go to  the Front as a conscript  and serve in the ranks  of an infantry  battalion.          __________________________________________________________________________  30--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: AS LEFT BY THE TRAITOR, DE WET: THE UNION JACK THE REBEL  LEADER TORE AND TRAMPLED UPON AT WINBURG.]    De Wet committed his first open act  of rebellion at Vrede, on October 28.  There, with a hastily raised commando at his heels, he forcibly seized the  place and, after  submitting the local officials  to brutal ill-treatment,  in a wild, incendiary  speech called on the Dutch of  South Africa to rise  in arms  against the  British Government.  It was at  Winburg that  De Wet  performed,  as  it is  stated,  the  theatrical  and unworthy  outrage  of  trampling on and tearing the Union Jack. The identical flag which suffered  the maltreatment is shown in our photograph,  in the state in which it was  after De Wet's puerile act of  defiance had been committed.

It will  be  seen  from  our  photographs  that the  trenches  on  the  East  Coast  are  constructed on  the  latest pattern  as developed  in  the war,  with  deep passage-ways,  roofed sections,  traverses, and  zigzags to  avoid an  enfilading  fire  from the  flank.  They  are,  indeed,  to judge  by  the  photograph, remarkably similar to those constructed at the front in France  and  Flanders.

Thus we are  caught in a vicious circle. The mere packing of the powdered earth  rejected behind the excavator would not account for so large a void. The  Cigale must have a special method of disposing of the waste earth. Let  us see if we can discover the secret.    Let us examine a larva at the moment of emerging from the soil. It is  almost always more or less smeared with mud, sometimes dried, sometimes  moist. The implements of excavation, the claws of the fore-feet, have  their points covered by little globules of mortar; the others bear  leggings of mud; the back is spotted with clay. One is reminded of a  scavenger who has been scooping up mud all day. This condition is the  more striking in that the insect comes from an absolutely dry soil. We  should expect to see it dusty; we find it muddy.    One more step, and the problem of the well is solved. I exhume a larva  which is working at its gallery of exit. Chance postpones this piece of  luck, which I cannot expect to achieve at once, since nothing on the  surface guides my search. But at last I am rewarded, and the larva is  just beginning its excavation. An inch of tunnel, free of all waste or  rubbish, and at the bottom the chamber, the place of rest; so far has  the work proceeded. And the worker--in what condition is it? Let us see.    The larva is much paler in colour than those which I have caught as they  emerged. The large eyes in particular are whitish, cloudy, blurred, and  apparently blind. What would be the use of sight underground? The eyes  of the larvae leaving their burrows are black and shining, and evidently  capable of sight. When it issues into the sunlight the future Cigale  must find, often at some distance from its burrow, a suitable twig from  which to hang during its metamorphosis, so that sight is obviously of  the greatest utility. The maturity of the eyes, attained during the time  of preparation before deliverance, proves that the larva, far from  boring its tunnel in haste, has spent a long time labouring at it.    What else do we notice? The blind, pale larva is far more voluminous  than in the mature state; it is swollen with liquid as though it had  dropsy. Taken in the fingers, a limpid serum oozes from the hinder part  of the body, which moistens the whole surface. Is this fluid, evacuated  by the intestine, a product of urinary secretion--simply the contents of  a stomach nourished entirely upon sap? I will not attempt to decide, but  for convenience will content myself with calling it urine.    Well, this fountain of urine is the key to the enigma. As it digs and  advances the larva waters the powdery debris and converts it into a  paste, which is immediately applied to the walls by the pressure of the  abdomen. Aridity is followed by plasticity. The mud thus obtained  penetrates the interstices of the rough soil; the more liquid portion  enters the substance of the soil by infiltration; the remainder becomes  tightly packed and fills up the inequalities of the walls. Thus the  insect obtains an empty tunnel, with no loose waste, as all the loosened  soil is utilised on the spot, converted into a mortar which is more  compact and homogeneous than the soil through which the shaft is  driven.    Thus the larva works in the midst of a coating of mud, which is the  cause of its dirtiness, so astonishing when we see it issue from an  excessively dry soil. The perfect insect, although henceforth liberated  from the work of a sapper and miner, does not entirely abandon the use  of urine as a weapon, employing it as a means of defence. Too closely  observed it throws a jet of liquid upon the importunate enemy and flies  away. In both its forms the Cigale, in spite of its dry temperament, is  a famous irrigator.    Dropsical as it is, the larva cannot contain sufficient liquid to  moisten and convert into easily compressible mud the long column of  earth which must be removed from the burrow. The reservoir becomes  exhausted, and the provision must be renewed. Where, and how? I think I  can answer the question.    The few burrows uncovered along their entirety, with the meticulous care  such a task demands, have revealed at the bottom, encrusted in the wall  of the terminal chamber, a living root, sometimes of the thickness of a  pencil, sometimes no bigger than a straw. The visible portion of this  root is only a fraction of an inch in length; the rest is hidden by the  surrounding earth. Is the presence of this source of sap fortuitous? Or  is it the result of deliberate choice on the part of the larva? I  incline towards the second alternative, so repeatedly was the presence  of a root verified, at least when my search was skilfully conducted.    Yes, the Cigale, digging its chamber, the nucleus of the future shaft,  seeks out the immediate neighbourhood of a small living root; it lays  bare a certain portion, which forms part of the wall, without  projecting. This living spot in the wall is the fountain where the  supply of moisture is renewed. When its reservoir is exhausted by the  conversion of dry dust into mud the miner descends to its chamber,  thrusts its proboscis into the root, and drinks deep from the vat built  into the wall. Its organs well filled, it re-ascends. It resumes work,  damping the hard soil the better to remove it with its talons, reducing  the debris to mud, in order to pack it tightly around it and obtain a  free passage. In this manner the shaft is driven upwards; logic and the  facts of the case, in the absence of direct observation, justify the  assertion.    If the root were to fail, and the reservoir of the intestine were  exhausted, what would happen? The following experiment will inform us: a  larva is caught as it leaves the earth. I place it at the bottom of a  test-tube, and cover it with a column of dry earth, which is rather  lightly packed. This column is about six inches in height. The larva has  just left an excavation three times as deep, made in soil of the same  kind, but offering a far greater resistance. Buried under this short  column of powdery earth, will it be able to gain the surface? If its  strength hold out the issue should be certain; having but lately made  its way through the hard earth, this obstacle should be easily removed.    But I am not so sure. In removing the stopper which divided it from the  outside world, the larva has expended its final store of liquid. The  cistern is dry, and in default of a living root there is no means of  replenishing it. My suspicions are well founded. For three days the  prisoner struggles desperately, but cannot ascend by so much as an inch.  It is impossible to fix the material removed in the absence of  moisture; as soon as it is thrust aside it slips back again. The labour  has no visible result; it is a labour of Sisyphus, always to be  commenced anew. On the fourth day the creature succumbs.    With the intestines full the result is very different.    I make the same experiment with an insect which is only beginning its  work of liberation. It is swollen with fluid, which oozes from it and  moistens the whole body. Its task is easy; the overlying earth offers  little resistance. A small quantity of liquid from the intestines  converts it into mud; forms a sticky paste which can be thrust aside  with the assurance that it will remain where it is placed. The shaft is  gradually opened; very unevenly, to be sure, and it is almost choked up  behind the insect as it climbs upwards. It seems as though the creature  recognises the impossibility of renewing its store of liquid, and so  economises the little it possesses, using only just so much as is  necessary in order to escape as quickly as possible from surroundings  which are strange to its inherited instincts. This parsimony is so well  judged that the insect gains the surface at the end of twelve days.    The gate of issue is opened and left gaping, like a hole made with an  augur. For some little time the larva wanders about the neighbourhood of  its burrow, seeking an eyrie on some low-growing bush or tuft of thyme,  on a stem of grass or grain, or the twig of a shrub. Once found, it  climbs and firmly clasps its support, the head upwards, while the talons  of the fore feet close with an unyielding grip. The other claws, if the  direction of the twig is convenient, assist in supporting it; otherwise  the claws of the two fore legs will suffice. There follows a moment of  repose, while the supporting limbs stiffen in an unbreakable hold. Then  the thorax splits along the back, and through the fissure the insect  slowly emerges. The whole process lasts perhaps half an hour.    There is the adult insect, freed of its mask, and how different from  what it was but how! The wings are heavy, moist, transparent, with  nervures of a tender green. The thorax is barely clouded with brown. All  the rest of the body is a pale green, whitish in places. Heat and a  prolonged air-bath are necessary to harden and colour the fragile  creature. Some two hours pass without any perceptible change. Hanging to  its deserted shell by the two fore limbs, the Cigale sways to the least  breath of air, still feeble and still green. Finally, the brown colour  appears and rapidly covers the whole body; the change of colour is  completed in half an hour. Fastening upon its chosen twig at nine  o'clock in the morning, the Cigale flies away under my eyes at half-past  twelve.    The empty shell remains, intact except for the fissure in the back;  clasping the twig so firmly that the winds of autumn do not always  succeed in detaching it. For some months yet and even during the winter  you will often find these forsaken skins hanging from the"]]]
