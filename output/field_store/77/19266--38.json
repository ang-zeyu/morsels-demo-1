The mastery of this instrument would give them power to change any  metal into gold, the cure of all diseases, and the happiness which  must come from the practical knowledge of the supreme secret of  nature.    The central quest of alchemy was the quest of an undefined and  undefinable something wherein was supposed to be contained all the  powers and potencies of life, and whatever makes life worth living.    The names given to this mystical something were as many as the  properties which were assigned to it. It was called _the one thing,  the essence, the philosopher's stone, the stone of wisdom, the  heavenly balm, the divine water, the virgin water, the carbuncle of  the sun, the old dragon, the lion, the basilisk, the phoenix_; and  many other names were given to it.    We may come near to expressing the alchemist's view of the essential  character of the object of their search by naming it _the soul of all  things_. \"Alchemy,\" a modern writer says, \"is the science of the soul  of all things.\"    The essence was supposed to have a material form, an ethereal or  middle nature, and an immaterial or spiritual life.    No one might hope to make this essence from any one substance,  because, as one of the alchemists says, \"It is the attribute of God  alone to make one out of one; you must produce one thing out of two  by natural generation.\" The alchemists did not pretend to create gold,  but only to produce it from other things.    The author of _A Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby_ says: \"We do not,  as is sometimes said, profess to create gold and silver, but only to  find an agent which ... is capable of entering into an intimate and  maturing union with the Mercury of the base metals.\" And again: \"Our  Art ... only arrogates to itself the power of developing, through the  removal of all defects and superfluities, the golden nature which the  baser metals possess.\" Bonus, in his tract on _The New Pearl of Great  Price_ (16th century), says: \"The Art of Alchemy ... does not create  metals, or even develop them out of the metallic first-substance; it  only takes up the unfinished handicraft of Nature and completes it....  Nature has only left a comparatively small thing for the artist to  do--the completion of that which she has already begun.\"    If the essence were ever attained, it would be by following the course  which nature follows in producing the perfect plant from the imperfect  seed, by discovering and separating the seed of metals, and bringing  that seed under the conditions which alone are suitable for its  growth. Metals must have seed, the alchemists said, for it would be  absurd to suppose they have none. \"What prerogative have vegetables  above metals,\" exclaims one of them, \"that God should give seed to the  one and withhold it from the other? Are not metals as much in His  sight as trees?\"    As metals, then, possess seed, it is evident how this seed is to be  made active; the seed of a plant is quickened by descending into the  earth, therefore the seed of metals must be destroyed before it  becomes life-producing. \"The processes of our art must begin with  dissolution of gold; they must terminate in a restoration of the  essential quality of gold.\" \"Gold does not easily give up its nature,  and will fight for its life; but our agent is strong enough to  overcome and kill it, and then it also has power to restore it to  life, and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body.\"    The application of the doctrine of the existence of seed in metals led  to the performance of many experiments, and, hence, to the  accumulation of a considerable body of facts established by  experimental inquiries. The belief of the alchemists that all natural  events are connected by a hidden thread, that everything has an  influence on other things, that \"what is above is as what is below,\"  constrained them to place stress on the supposed connexion between the  planets and the metals, and to further their metallic transformations  by performing them at times when certain planets were in conjunction.  The seven principal planets and the seven principal metals were called  by the same names: _Sol_ (gold), _Luna_ (silver), _Saturn_ (lead),  _Jupiter_ (tin), _Mars_ (iron), _Venus_ (copper), and _Mercury_  (mercury). The author of _The New Chemical Light_ taught that one  metal could be propagated from another only in the order of  superiority of the planets. He placed the seven planets in the  following descending order: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus,  Mercury, Luna. \"The virtues of the planets descend,\" he said, \"but do  not ascend\"; it is easy to change Mars (iron) into Venus (copper), for  instance, but Venus cannot be transformed into Mars.    Although the alchemists regarded everything as influencing, and  influenced by, other things, they were persuaded that the greatest  effects are produced on a substance by substances of like nature with  itself. Hence, most of them taught that the seed of metals will be  obtained by operations with metals, not by the action on metals of  things of animal or vegetable origin. Each class of substances, they  said, has a life, or spirit (an essential character, we might say) of  its own. \"The life of sulphur,\" Paracelsus said, \"is a combustible,  ill-smelling, fatness.... The life of gems and corals is mere  colour.... The life of water is its flowing.... The life of fire is  air.\" Grant an attraction of like to like, and the reason becomes  apparent for such directions as these: \"Nothing heterogeneous must be  introduced into our magistery\"; \"Everything should be made to act on  that which is like it, and then Nature will perform her duty.\"    Although each class of substances was said by the alchemists to have  its own particular character, or life, nevertheless they taught that  there is a deep-seated likeness between all things, inasmuch as the  power of _the essence_, or _the one thing_, is so great that under its  influence different things are produced from the same origin, and  different things are caused to pass into and become the same thing.  In _The New Chemical Light_ it is said: \"While the seed of all things  is one, it is made to generate a great variety of things.\"    It is not easy now--it could not have been easy at any time--to give  clear and exact meanings to the doctrines of the alchemists, or the  directions they gave for performing the operations necessary for the  production of the object of their search. And the difficulty is much  increased when we are told that \"The Sage jealously conceals [his  knowledge] from the sinner and the scornful, lest the mysteries of  heaven should be laid bare to the vulgar gaze.\" We almost despair when  an alchemical writer assures us that the Sages \"Set pen to paper for  the express purpose of concealing their meaning. The sense of a whole  passage is often hopelessly obscured by the addition or omission of  one little word, for instance the addition of the word _not_ in the  wrong place.\" Another writer says: \"The Sages are in the habit of  using words which may convey either a true or a false impression; the  former to their own disciples and children, the latter to the  ignorant, the foolish, and the unworthy.\" Sometimes, after  descriptions of processes couched in strange and mystical language,  the writer will add, \"If you cannot perceive what you ought to  understand herein, you should not devote yourself to the study of  philosophy.\" Philalethes, in his _Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby_,  seems to feel some pity for his readers; after describing what he  calls \"the generic homogeneous water of gold,\" he says: \"If you wish  for a more particular description of our water, I am impelled by  motives of charity to tell you that it is living, flexible, clear,  nitid, white as snow, hot, humid, airy, vaporous, and digestive.\"    Alchemy began by asserting that nature must be simple; it assumed that  a knowledge of the plan and method of natural occurrences is to be  obtained by thinking; and it used analogy as the guide in applying  this knowledge of nature's design to particular events, especially the  analogy, assumed by alchemy to exist, between material phenomena and  human emotions.          CHAPTER III.    THE ALCHEMICAL CONCEPTION OF THE UNITY AND SIMPLICITY OF NATURE.      In the preceding chapter I have referred to the frequent use made by  the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan,  or at any rate a very similar plan, in all her processes. If this  supposition is accepted, the primary business of an investigator of  nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the  surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events. As this idea, and  this practice, were the foundations whereon the superstructure of  alchemy was raised, I think it is important to amplify them more fully  than I have done already.    Mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage  named _Hermes Trismegistus_, who is said to have lived a little later  than the time of Moses. Representations of Hermes Trismegistus are  found on ancient Egyptian monuments. We are told that Alexander the  Great found his tomb near Hebron; and that the tomb contained a slab  of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written. The eighth  sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows:    \"Ascend with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14226"],[0,"Lobo, Rag and Vixen (#5)"],[1,"se, while a few of the  more sensible began to carry away fat white eggs. But the old partridge,  coming to the little ones, picked up one of these juicy-looking bags and  clucked and dropped it, and picked it up again and again and clucked,  then swallowed it. The young ones stood around, then one little yellow  fellow, the one that sat on the chip, picked up an ant-egg, dropped it a  few times, then yielding to a sudden impulse, swallowed it, and so had  learned to eat. Within twenty minutes even the runt had learned, and a  merry time they had scrambling after the delicious eggs as their mother  broke open more ant-galleries, and sent them and their contents rolling  down the bank, till every little partridge had so crammed his little  crop that he was positively misshapen and could eat no more.    Then all went cautiously up the stream, and on a sandy bank, well  screened by brambles, they lay for all that afternoon, and learned how  pleasant it was to feel the cool, powdery dust running between their hot  little toes. With their strong bent for copying, they lay on their sides  like their mother and scratched with their tiny feet and flopped with  their wings, though they had no wings to flop with, only a little tag  among the down on each side, to show where the wings would come. That  night she took them to a dry thicket near by, and there among the crisp,  dead leaves that would prevent an enemy's silent approach on foot, and  under the interlacing briers that kept off all foes of the air, she  cradled them in their feather-shingled nursery and rejoiced in the  fulness of a mother's joy over the wee cuddling things that peeped in  their steep and snuggled so trustfully against her warm body.          II      The third day the chicks were much stronger on their feet. They no  longer had to go around an acorn; they could even scramble over  pine-cones, and on the little tags that marked the places for their  wings, were now to be seen blue rows of fat blood-quills.    Their start in life was a good mother, good legs, a few reliable  instincts, and a germ of reason. It was instinct, that is, inherited  habit, which taught them to hide at the word from their mother; it was  instinct that taught them to follow her, but it was reason which made  them keep under the shadow of her tail when the sun was smiting down,  and from that day reason entered more and more into their expanding  lives.    Next day the blood-quills had sprouted the tips of feathers. On the  next, the feathers were well out, and a week later the whole family of  down-clad babies were strong on the wing.    And yet not all--poor little Runtie had been sickly from the first. He  bore his half-shell on his back for hours after he came out; he ran less  and cheeped more than his brothers, and when one evening at the onset of  a skunk the mother gave the word '_Kwit, kwit_' (Fly, fly), Runtie was  left behind, and when she gathered her brood on the piney hill he was  missing, and they saw him no more.    Meanwhile, their training had gone on. They knew that the finest  grasshoppers abounded in the long grass by the brook; they knew that the  currant-bushes dropped fatness in the form of smooth, green worms; they  knew that the dome of an ant-hill rising against the distant woods stood  for a garner of plenty; they knew that strawberries, though not really  insects, were almost as delicious; they knew that the huge danaid  butterflies were good, safe game, if they could only catch them, and  that a slab of bark dropping from the side of a rotten log was sure to  abound in good things of many different kinds; and they had learned,  also, the yellow-jackets, mud-wasps, woolly worms, and hundred-leggers  were better let alone.    It was now July, the Moon of Berries. The chicks had grown and  flourished amazingly during this last month, and were now so large that  in her efforts to cover them the mother was kept standing all night.    They took their daily dust-bath, but of late had changed to another  higher on the hill. It was one in use by many different birds, and at  first the mother disliked the idea of such a second-hand bath. But the  dust was of such a fine, agreeable quality, and the children led the way  with such enthusiasm, that she forgot her mistrust.    After a fortnight the little ones began to droop and she herself did not  feel very well. They were always hungry, and though they ate  enormously, they one and all grew thinner and thinner. The mother was  the last to be affected. But when it came, it came as hard on her--a  ravenous hunger, a feverish headache, and a wasting weakness. She never  knew the cause. She could not know that the dust of the much-used  dust-bath, that her true instinct taught her to mistrust at first, and  now again to shun, was sown with parasitic worms, and that all of the  family were infested.    No natural impulse is without a purpose. The mother-bird's knowledge of  healing was only to follow natural impulse. The eager, feverish craving  for something, she knew not what, led her to eat, or try, everything  that looked eatable and to seek the coolest woods. And there she found a  deadly sumach laden with its poison fruit. A month ago she would have  passed it by, but now she tried the unattractive berries. The acrid  burning juice seemed to answer some strange demand of her body; she ate  and ate, and all her family joined in the strange feast of physic. No  human doctor could have hit it better; it proved a biting, drastic  purge, the dreadful secret foe was downed, the danger passed. But not  for all--Nature, the old nurse, had come too late for two of them. The  weakest, by inexorable law, dropped out. Enfeebled by the disease, the  remedy was too severe for them. They drank and drank by the stream, and  next morning did not move when the others followed the mother. Strange  vengeance was theirs now, for a skunk, the same that could have told  where Runtie went, found and devoured their bodies and died of the  poison they had eaten.    Seven little partridges now obeyed the mother's call. Their individual  characters were early shown and now developed fast. The weaklings were  gone, but there was still a fool and a lazy one. The mother could not  help caring for some more than for others, and her favorite was the  biggest, he who once sat on the yellow chip for concealment. He was not  only the biggest, strongest, and handsomest of the brood, the best of  all, the most obedient. His mother's warning '_rrrrr_' (danger) did not  always keep the others from a risky path or a doubtful food, but  obedience seemed natural to him, and he never failed to respond to her  soft '_K-reet_' (Come), and of this obedience he reaped the reward, for  his days were longest in the land.    August, the Molting Moon, went by; the young ones were now three parts  grown. They knew just enough to think themselves wonderfully wise. When  they were small it was necessary to sleep on the ground so their mother  could shelter them, but now they were too big to need that, and the  mother began to introduce grown-up ways of life. It was time to roost in  the trees. The young weasels, foxes, skunks, and minks were beginning to  run. The ground grew more dangerous each night, so at sundown Mother  Partridge called '_K-reet_' and flew into a thick, low tree.    The little ones followed, except one, an obstinate little fool who  persisted in sleeping on the ground as heretofore. It was all right that  time, but the next night his brothers were awakened by his cries. There  was a slight scuffle, then stillness, broken only by a horrid sound of  crunching bones and a smacking of lips. They peered down into the  terrible darkness below, where the glint of two close-set eyes and a  peculiar musty smell told them that a mink was the killer of their fool  brother.    Six little partridges now sat in a row at night, with their mother in  the middle, though it was not unusual for some little one with cold feet  to perch on her back.    Their education went on, and about this time they were taught  'whirring.' A partridge can rise on the wing silently if it wishes, but  whirring is so important at times that all are taught how and when to  rise on thundering wings. Many ends are gained by the whirr. It warns  all other partridges near that danger is at hand, it unnerves the  gunner, or it fixes the foe's attention on the whirrer, while the others  sneak off in silence, or by squatting, escape notice.    A partridge adage might well be 'foes and food for every moon.'  September came, with seeds and grain in place of berries and ant-eggs,  and gunners in place of skunks and minks.    The partridges knew well what a fox was, but had scarcely seen a dog. A  fox they knew they could easily baffle by taking to a tree, but when in  the Gunner Moon old Cuddy came prowling through the ravine with his  bob-tailed yellow cur, the mother spied the dog and cried out _Kwit!  Kwit_!\" (Fly, fly). Two of the brood thought it a pity their mother  should lose her wits so easily over a fox, and were pleased to show  their superior nerve by springing into a tree in spite of her earnestly  repeated '_Kwit! Kwit!_' and her example of speeding away on silent  wings.    Meanwhile, the strange bob-tailed fox came under the tree and yapped and  yapped at them. They were much amused at him and at their mother and  brothers, so much so that they never noticed a rustling in the bushes  till there was a loud _Bang! bang!_ and down fell two bloody, flopping  partridges, to be seized and mangled by the yellow cur until the gunner  ran from the bushes and rescued the remains.          III      Cuddy lived in a wretched shanty near the Don, north of Toronto. His was  what Greek philosophy would have demonstrated to be an ideal existence.  He had no wealth, no taxes, no social pretensions, and no property to  speak of. His life was made up of a very little work and a great"]]]
