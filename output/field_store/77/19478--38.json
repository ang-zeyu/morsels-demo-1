While three or four individuals may sometimes be  trapped at a single mound, more than two are seldom so caught, and most  often only one in one night. Trapping on successive nights at one mound  often yields the larger number, yet in some cases the number is  explained by the fact that two or three nearly mature young are taken,  and the capture of several individuals at a single mound can not be  taken to indicate that all are from the one den. Our investigations tend  strongly to the conclusion that only one adult occupies a mound, except  during the period when the young are in the parental (or maternal) den.  In the gassing and excavating of 25 or more mounds we have never found  more than one animal in a den, except in one instance, and then the two  present were obviously young animals.      SENSE DEVELOPMENTS.    Without making special investigations through a study of behavior or  other special methods, one can speak in only general terms regarding  what appear to be the special sense developments of kangaroo rats. The  eyes are large, as is very often the case in nocturnal animals, and when  brought out into the bright light of day the rats perhaps do not see  well. Yet, if an animal leaves a den which is in process of excavation,  and follows one runway, even in bright sunlight, it makes excellent  speed to the next opening, often a distance of several yards. Whether  this is accomplished chiefly by the aid of sight or in large measure by  a maze-following ability, such as experiments have shown some rodents to  have, can not be stated without precise experimentation. Marked ability  to follow a maze would not be at all surprising in view of the  labyrinthine character of the underground passages which make up the  normal habitation.    When watching beside a mound by moonlight one is impressed with the fact  that the rats possess either a very keen sense of hearing or of sight,  probably both. The very slightest movement or noise on the part of the  observer results, with a timid individual, in an instantaneous leap for  safety, a disappearance into the burrow so sudden as to be almost  startling. All attempts to obtain flashlight photographs at the mounds  were failures, the animal either having gotten completely out of the  field before the light flashed following the pull of the trigger, or  leaving merely an indistinguishable blur on the plate as it went, and  this in spite of carefully hiding the trigger chain behind a screen. A  slight noise accompanying the trigger action gave the alarm in one case,  and in another the length of time of the flash was sufficient for the  get-away. The marvelous quickness of the animal clearly indicates a  remarkably short reaction time. Occasionally a bold individual is  found, as in the case of one which came out repeatedly, even after being  flashed twice in the same night.    Certain peculiar physical characteristics suggest a relationship to  sense reactions. On these, however, the authors are not prepared to do  more than offer suggestions for future work. The extremely large  mastoids found in kangaroo rats suggest a connection in some way with  special developments of the sense of hearing or of balance. It may be  noted that an intermediate condition between the kangaroo rats and the  majority of rodents in respect to this character is to be found in the  pocket mice (_Perognathus_), which belong to the same family. Herein  lies a field for some interesting experimentation and discovery.    The small, pointed nose might suggest a not overkeen sense of smell, and  there appears no reason to believe that this sense is particularly well  developed. However, the turbinals are very complex. The vibrissae are  long and sensitive, and may indicate a special development of the sense  of touch as an adaptation to nocturnal habits and to life in an  underground labyrinth. The long, well-haired tail doubtless serves as an  important tactile organ as well as a balance.      MOVEMENTS AND ATTITUDES.    Movements and attitudes are characteristic. As a kangaroo rat emerges  from the burrow a reason for the relatively large size of the opening is  seen in the fact that, kangaroolike, the animal maintains a partially  upright position. Its ordinary mode of progression is hopping along on  the large hind legs, or, when in the open and going at speed, leaping.  When moving slowly about over the mound, as if searching for food, it  uses the fore legs in a kind of creeping movement. It appears to be  creeping when pocketing grain strewn about, but close observation shows  that the fore feet are then used for sweeping material into the pockets,  reminding one somewhat of a vacuum cleaner. When it assumes a partially  upright position the fore limbs are usually drawn up so closely that  they can be seen only by looking upward from a somewhat lower level than  that occupied by the animal. The slower movements of searching or  playing about the mound are occasionally interrupted by a sudden leap  directly upward to a height of 1-1/2 to 2 feet, often with no apparent  reason other than play. This is, however, a fighting or guarding  movement, though indulged in for play. The play instinct seems to be  well developed, and in evidence on any moonlight night when actual  harvesting operations are not going on.      STORING HABITS.    Probably no instinct is of greater importance to the kangaroo rat than  that of storing food supplies. When a crop of desirable seeds is  maturing the animal's activities appear to be concentrated on this work.  During September, 1919, when a good crop of grass seed was ripening  following the summer rains, a kangaroo rat under observation made  repeated round trips to the harvest field of grass heads. Each outward  trip occupied from 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, while the unloading trip into the  burrow took only 15 to 20 seconds.    One individual in a laboratory cage, which had not yet been given a nest  box, busied itself in broad daylight in carrying its grain supply into  the darkest corner of the cage. When a nest box is supplied the  individual will retreat into its dark shelter, and will only come forth  after darkness has fallen unless forcibly ejected, but will store the  food supplied.    In another case an animal escaped while being handled, and sought refuge  behind a built-in laboratory table, where it could not be recovered  without tearing out the table. For four days and nights it had the run  of the laboratory. On the first night of its freedom it found and  entered a burlap bag of grass seed that had been taken from a mound. A  trail of seed and chaff next morning showed that it had been busily  engaged in making its new quarters comfortable with bedding and food.  After four nights of freedom it was captured alive in a trap, and later  it was found that it had moved from the corner behind the table to the  space beneath a near-by drawer, where it had stored about 2 quarts of  the grass seed and a handful of the oatmeal used for trap bait.      BREEDING HABITS.    Observations on breeding habits have consisted mainly in taking records  from the females trapped at all seasons of the year throughout the  course of the investigation, and from examinations made during poisoning  operations, and yet from this source the number of pregnant females  taken or of young discovered is disappointingly small. The records  indicate a breeding period of considerable length, extending from  January to August, inclusive. It is possible that the length of the  period may be increased by a second litter from the earliest breeding  females in summer, but the large percentage of nonpregnant or  nonbreeding animals which occurs throughout the season would indicate a  wide variation in the time of breeding of different individuals.    Trapping in February and March for the purpose of securing greater  numbers of female specimens, begun with the idea that these months were  most likely to be the breeding months, has invariably yielded an  unsatisfactory number of nonbreeding specimens and males. Unfortunately,  the numbers of females secured in some months were not sufficient to be  significant if worked out in percentages of breeding and nonbreeding  individuals, and this, coupled with the fact that the importance of  recording carefully all nonbreeders was not at first recognized, makes  it impossible to tabulate such information reliably. The total of  females taken in April, for example, is only 3, of which 1 was breeding;  while in June, during the course of poisoning operations, 45 females  were examined, of which 21 were breeding.    Five breeding females were taken in January, all during the last three  days of the month. One of these was a suckling female, the young of  which were secured alive and were probably at least a week old when  taken. This must have been exceptionally early for young, since of a  number of adult kangaroo rats taken during the first week of January  none have been found to be breeding. Two records from Vernon Bailey are  as follows: May 19-June 8, 1903, young specimen in nest (Santa Rosa, N.  Mex.); June 12, 1889, one female, two embryos (Oracle, Ariz.).    The considerable proportion (which we believe to be more than 50 per  cent) of nonbreeding females taken during all those months in which  breeding has been found to occur may also indicate an extended period of  breeding, with a small percentage breeding at any one time. This period  also furnishes ample time for the rearing of two litters a year by some  females, but we have no evidence as to the occurrence of two litters.  Young of the year, practically grown, are taken during and after the  month of April.    The mammae are arranged in three pairs, pectoral, 1/1; inguinal, 2/2.

It is the largest in the region. It will be seen by  reference to figure 3 that I arrive at its age in the following way.  Where it now stands, so striking an object, it is about one-third of a  mile above the point where the Bowstring River enters the Rainy River.  If however from the top of the mound you look southward through the  trees a view may be got of the silver stream of the Bowstring, coming  as if directly toward the mound. Originally no doubt this tributary  flowed close by the mound, for the mound would undoubtedly be built on  the extreme point. But as from year to year the Bowstring River  deposited the detritus carried down by it, it formed a bank or bar,  and was gradually diverted from its course, until now, the peninsula  some hundreds of yards across its base, has become upwards of a third  of a mile long. I infer that this peninsula, which I should say  contains some seventy acres has been formed since the mound--which  from its position seems for observation as well as for sepulture--was  begun. Some 200 yards down the point from the grand mound occurs  another small mound. This is some eight or ten feet high, and fifty or  sixty feet across. Along the point and close past this small mound  runs an old water course, now a treeless hay meadow. At high water in  spring, as I ascertained, the river still sends its surplus water by  this old channel. My position is that the 200 yards of earth between  the site of the grand mound and that of the small mound was deposited  after the grand mound was begun, and before the commencement of the  small mound. Undoubtedly this small mound as well as a similar one not  far up the river from the grand mound, were begun on account of the  laborious work of carrying bones and earth to such a height, and on  account of the numerous interments which have left the surface of the  grand mound a bone pile. This is shown by the small mound being on a  site more recent than that of the large mound. Suppose a hundred years  to have sufficed to raise the small mound to its height when the  devastating ruin of the Sioux slaughtered the last mound builder and  checked the mound. From our previous position this would represent a  point some 500 years ago. But during this 500 years according to our  hypothesis all of the point of land below the small mound, that is to  say, about 300 yards in length, has been formed. The question then is,  how long at the same rate must it have taken the 200 yards between the  two mounds to form. This brings us then to a point say 300 years  before the time of beginning of the small mound. We thus arrive at  about 800 years ago as the time when the grand mound was begun. It  will thus be seen that we have reached back to the eleventh century,  the time previously deduced from historic date for the arrival of the  Toltecans on the Rainy River.    CONCLUSION.    Our investigation has now come to an end. I have led you to examine  the few fragments of a civilization which it would be absurd to  declare to have been of the very highest type, but yet of a character  much above that of the wandering tribes, which, with their well-known  thirst for blood, destroyed the very arts and useful habits which  might have bettered their condition. The whirlwind of barbarian fury  is ever one which fills peaceful nations with terror. We may remember  how near in the \"Agony of Canada,\" the French power was to being  swept out of existence by the fierce fury of the Iroquois--up to that  time always victorious. We may remember how civilization in Minnesota  was thrown back by the Sioux massacre of 1861. It is only now by  persistent and unwearied efforts that we can hope to conquer the  Indians by the arts of peace, and by inducing him to take the hoe in  place of the tomahawk, to meet nature's obstacles. Who can fail to  heave a sigh for our northern mound builders, and to lament the  destruction of so vast and civilized a race as the peaceful Toltecans  of Mexico, of the Mississippi, and of the Ohio, to which our  Takawgamis belonged? After all, their life must in the main, ever  remain a mystery.         THE LOST RACE         \"One of our visits to the mound was at night.\"         Oh, silent mound! thy secret tell!       God's acre gazing toward the sky,       'Midst sombre shade 'neath angel's eye       Thou sleepest till the domesday knell.         Sweet leaflets, on the towering elms.       Oh whisper from your crested height!       Or have lost forests borne from sight       The secret to their buried realms?         Stay, babbling river, hurrying past,       Cans't thou, who saw'st the toilers build,       Not picture on thy bosom stilled,       Life-speaking shadows long since cast?         Or, echo, mocking us with sound,       Repeat the busy voice, we pray,       Of moiling thousands, now dull clay,       And waken up the gloom profound.         Pale, shimmering ghosts that flit around,       While spade and mattock death-fields glean,       Open with words from the unseen       The mysteries now in cerements bound.         No answer yet! We gaze in vain.       With lamp and lore let science come.       Now, clear eyed maiden!!--You, too, dumb!       Your light gone out!!--'tis night again.         And is this all? an earthen pot!       A broken spear! a copper pin!       Earth's grandest prizes counted in,       A burial mound!--the common lot!         Yes! this were all; but o'er the mound,       The stars, that fill the midnight sky,       Are eyes from Heaven that watch on high       Till domesday's thrilling life-note sound.               *       *       *       *       *        TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES       Page 9 (b): The following changes have been made from the original     text:          come changed to came (it came from a distant locality);          impliments changed to implements (crushed in by one of these        implements.)
