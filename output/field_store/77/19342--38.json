[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#5)"],[1," Galatians, \"I marvel that ye are so unsteady, unfaithful.\" He says,  \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed.\" He does not address them as  evildoers. He speaks to them as people who have suffered great loss. He  condemns those who removed them rather than the Galatians. At the same  time he gently reproves them for permitting themselves to be removed.  The criticism is implied that they should have been rather a little more  settled in their beliefs. If they had taken better hold of the Word they  could not have been removed so easily.    Jerome thinks that Paul is playing upon the name Galatians, deriving  it from the Hebrew word Galath, which means fallen or carried away, as  though Paul wanted to say, \"You are true Galatians, i.e., fallen away in  name and in fact.\" Some believe that the Germans are descended from  the Galatians. There may be something to that. For the Germans are not  unlike the Galatians in their lack of constancy. At first we Germans are  very enthusiastic, but presently our emotions cool and we become slack.  When the light of the Gospel first came to us many were zealous, heard  sermons greedily, and held the ministry of God's Word in high esteem.  But now that religion has been reformed, many who formerly were  such earnest disciples have discarded the Word of God, have become  sow-bellies like the foolish and inconsistent Galatians.        VERSE 6. From him that called you into the grace of Christ.    The reading is a little doubtful. The sentence may be construed to read:  \"From that Christ that called you into grace\"; or it may be construed to  read: \"From God that called you into the grace of Christ.\" I prefer the  former for it seems to me that Paul's purpose is to impress upon us the  benefits of Christ. This reading also preserves the implied criticism  that the Galatians withdrew themselves from that Christ who had called  them not unto the law, but unto grace. With Paul we decry the blindness  and perverseness of men in that they will not receive the message of  grace and salvation, or having received it they quickly let go of it,  in spite of the fact that the Gospel bestows all good things spiritual:  forgiveness of sins, true righteousness, peace of conscience,  everlasting life; and all good things temporal: good judgment, good  government and peace.    Why does the world abhor the glad tidings of the Gospel and the  blessings that go with it? Because the world is the devil's. Under his  direction the world persecutes the Gospel and would if it could nail  again Christ, the Son of God, to the Cross although He gave Himself into  death for the sins of the world. The world dwells in darkness. The world  is darkness.    Paul accentuates the point that the Galatians had been called by Christ  unto grace. \"I taught you the doctrine of grace and of liberty from  the Law, from sin and wrath, that you should be free in Christ, and  not slaves to the hard laws of Moses. Will you allow yourselves to be  carried away so easily from the living fountain of grace and life?\"        VERSE 6. Unto another gospel.    Note the resourcefulness of the devil. Heretics do not advertise their  errors. Murderers, adulterers, thieves disguise themselves. So the devil  masquerades all his devices and activities. He puts on white to make  himself look like an angel of light. He is astoundingly clever to sell  his patent poison for the Gospel of Christ. Knowing Satan's guile, Paul  sardonically calls the doctrine of the false apostles \"another gospel,\"  as if he would say, \"You Galatians have now another gospel, while my  Gospel is no longer esteemed by you.\"    We infer from this that the false apostles had depreciated the Gospel  of Paul among the Galatians on the plea that it was incomplete.  Their objection to Paul's Gospel is identical to that recorded in the  fifteenth chapter of the Book of Acts to the effect that it was not  enough for the Galatians to believe in Christ, or to be baptized, but  that it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the  law of Moses, for \"except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses,  ye cannot be saved.\" As though Christ were a workman who had begun a  building and left it for Moses to finish.    Today the Anabaptists and others, finding it difficult to condemn us,  accuse us Lutherans of timidity in professing the whole truth. They  grant that we have laid the foundation in Christ, but claim that we  have failed to go through with the building. In this way these perverse  fanatics parade their cursed doctrine as the Word of God, and, flying  the flag of God's name, they deceive many. The devil knows better  than to appear ugly and black. He prefers to carry on his nefarious  activities in the name of God. Hence the German proverb: \"All mischief  begins in the name of God.\"    When the devil sees that he cannot hurt the cause of the Gospel by  destructive methods, he does it under the guise of correcting and  advancing the cause of the Gospel. He would like best of all to  persecute us with fire and sword, but this method has availed him little  because through the blood of martyrs the church has been watered. Unable  to prevail by force, he engages wicked and ungodly teachers who at first  make common cause with us, then claim that they are particularly called  to teach the hidden mysteries of the Scriptures to superimpose upon the  first principles of Christian doctrine that we teach. This sort of thing  brings the Gospel into trouble. May we all cling to the Word of Christ  against the wiles of the devil, \"for we wrestle not against flesh and  blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers  of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high  places.\"        VERSE 7. Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you.    Here again the apostle excuses the Galatians, while he blames the false  apostles for disturbing their consciences and for stealing them out  of his hand. How angry he gets at these deceivers! He calls them  troublemakers, seducers of poor consciences.    This passage adduces further evidence that the false apostles defamed  Paul as an imperfect apostle and a weak and erroneous preacher. They  condemn Paul, Paul condemns them. Such warfare of condemnation is always  going on in the church. The papists and the fanatics hate us, condemn  our doctrine, and want to kill us. We in turn hate and condemn their  cursed doctrine. In the meanwhile the people are uncertain whom to  follow and which way to turn, for it is not given to everybody to  judge these matters. But the truth will win out. So much is certain,  we persecute no man, neither does our doctrine trouble men. On the  contrary, we have the testimony of many good men who thank God on their  knees for the consolation that our doctrine has brought them. Like Paul,  we are not to blame that the churches have trouble. The fault lies with  the Anabaptists and other fanatics.    Every teacher of work-righteousness is a trouble-maker. Has it never  occurred to you that the pope, cardinals, bishops, monks, and that the  whole synagogue of Satan are trouble-makers? The truth is, they are  worse than false apostles. The false apostles taught that in addition  to faith in Christ the works of the Law of God were necessary unto  salvation. But the papists omit faith altogether and teach self-devised  traditions and works that are not commanded of God, indeed are contrary  to the Word of God, and for these traditions they demand preferred  attention and obedience.    Paul calls the false apostles troublers of the church because they  taught circumcision and the keeping of the Law as needful unto  salvation. They insisted that the Law must be observed in every detail.  They were supporters in this contention by the Jews, with the result  that those who were not firmly established in faith were easily  persuaded that Paul was not a sincere teacher of God because he ignored  the Law. The Jews were offended at the idea that the Law of God  should be entirely ignored by Paul and that the Gentiles, former  idol-worshippers, should gratuitously attain to the station of God's  people without circumcision, without the penitentiary performance of the  law, by grace alone through faith in Christ Jesus.    These criticisms were amplified by the false apostles. They accused  Paul of designs to abolish the law of God and the Jewish dispensation,  contrary to the law of God, contrary to their Jewish heritage, contrary  to apostolic example, contrary to Paul's own example. They demanded that  Paul be shunned as a blasphemer and a rebel, while they were to be heard  as true teachers of the Gospel and authentic disciples of the apostles.  Thus Paul stood defamed among the Galatians. He was forced to attack the  false apostles. He did so without hesitation.        VERSE 7. And would pervert the gospel of Christ.  To paraphrase this sentence: \"These false apostles do not merely trouble  you, they abolish Christ's Gospel. They act as if they were the only  true Gospel-preachers. For all that they muddle Law and Gospel. As a  result they pervert the Gospel. Either Christ must live and the Law  perish, or the Law remains and Christ must perish; Christ and the Law  cannot dwell side by side in the conscience. It is either grace or law.  To muddle the two is to eliminate the Gospel of Christ entirely.\"    It seems a small matter to mingle the Law and Gospel, faith and works,  but it creates more mischief than man's brain can conceive. To mix Law  and Gospel not only clouds the knowledge of grace, it cuts out Christ  altogether.    The words of Paul, \"and would pervert the gospel of Christ,\" also  indicate how arrogant these false apostles were. They were shameless  boasters. Paul simply had to exalt his own ministry and Gospel.        VERSE 8. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other    gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15535"],[0,"Violin Mastery: Talks with Master Violinists and Teachers (#5)"],[1,"type.  One never meets with extended _staccato_ passages in Beethoven, Brahms,  Bruch or Lalo. And the Saint-Saens's violin concerto, if I remember  rightly, contains but a single _staccato_ passage.    \"_Spiccato_ is a very different matter from _staccato_: violinists as a  rule use the middle of the bow for _spiccato_: I use the upper third of  the bow, and thus get most satisfactory results, in no matter what  _tempo_. This question as to what portion of the bow to use for  _spiccato_ each violinist must decide for himself, however, through  experiment. I have tried both ways and find that by the last mentioned  use of the bow I secure quicker, cleaner results. Students while  practicing this bowing should take care that the wrist, and never the  arm, be used. Hubay has written some very excellent studies for this  form of 'springing bow.'    \"The trill, when it rolls quickly and evenly, is a trill indeed! I never  had any difficulty in acquiring it, and can keep on trilling  indefinitely without the slightest unevenness or slackening of speed.  Auer himself has assured me that I have a trill that runs on and on  without a sign of fatigue or uncertainty. The trill has to be practiced  very slowly at first, later with increasing rapidity, and always with a  firm pressure of the fingers. It is a very beautiful embellishment, and  one much used; one finds it in Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Brahms, etc.    \"Double notes never seemed hard to me, but harmonics are not as easily  acquired as some of the other violin effects. I advise pressing down the  first finger on the strings _inordinately_, especially in the higher  positions, when playing artificial harmonics. The higher the fingers  ascend on the strings, the more firmly they should press them, otherwise  the harmonics are apt to grow shrill and lose in clearness. The majority  of students have trouble with their harmonics, because they do not  practice them in this way. Of course the quality of the harmonics  produced varies with the quality of the strings that produce them. First  class strings are an absolute necessity for the production of pure  harmonics. Yet in the case of the artist, he himself is held  responsible, and not his strings.    \"Octaves? Occasionally, as in Auer's transcript of Beethoven's _Dance of  the Dervishes_, or in the closing section of the Ernst Concerto, when  they are used to obtain a certain weird effect, they sound well. But  ordinarily, if cleanly played, they sound like one-note successions. In  the examples mentioned, the so-called 'fingered octaves,' which are very  difficult, are employed. Ordinary octaves are not so troublesome. After  all, in octave playing we simply double the notes for the purpose of  making them more powerful.    \"As regards the playing of tenths, it seems to me that the interval  always sounds constrained, and hardly ever euphonious enough to justify  its difficulty, especially in rapid passages. Yet Paganini used this  awkward interval very freely in his compositions, and one of his  'Caprices' is a variation in tenths, which should be played more often  than it is, as it is very effective. In this connection change of  position, which I have already touched on with regard to scale playing,  should be so smooth that it escapes notice. Among special effects the  _glissando_ is really beautiful when properly done. And this calls for  judgment. It might be added, though, that the _glissando_ is an effect  which should not be overdone. The _portamento_--gliding from one note to  another--is also a lovely effect. Its proper and timely application  calls for good judgment and sound musical taste.                                  A SPANISH VIOLIN    \"I usually play a 'Strad,' but very often turn to my beautiful  'Guillami,'\" said Mr. Brown when asked about his violins. \"It is an old  Spanish violin, made in Barcelona, in 1728, with a tone that has a  distinct Stradivarius character. In appearance it closely resembles a  Guadagnini, and has often been taken for one. When the dealer of whom I  bought it first showed it to me it was complete--but in four distinct  pieces! Kubelik, who was in Budapest at the time, heard of it and wanted  to buy it; but the dealer, as was only right, did not forget that my  offer represented a prior claim, and so I secured it. The Guadagnini,  which I have played in all my concerts here, I am very fond of--it has a  Stradivarius tone rather than the one we usually associate with the  make.\" Mr. Brown showed the writer his Grancino, a beautiful little  instrument about to be sent to the repair shop, since exposure to the  damp atmosphere of the sea-shore had opened its seams--and the rare and  valuable Simon bow, now his, which had once been the property of  Sivori. Mr. Brown has used a wire E ever since he broke six gut strings  in one hour while at Seal Harbor, Maine. \"A wire string, I find, is not  only easier to play, but it has a more brilliant quality of tone than a  gut string; and I am now so accustomed to using a wire E, that I would  feel ill at ease if I did not have one on my instrument. Contrary to  general belief, it does not sound 'metallic,' unless the string itself  is of very poor quality.      PROGRAMS    \"In making up a recital program I try to arrange it so that the first  half, approximately, may appeal to the more specifically musical part of  my audience, and to the critics. In the second half I endeavor to  remember the general public; at the same time being careful to include  nothing which is not really _musical_. This (Mr. Brown found one of his  recent programs on his desk and handed it to me) represents a logical  compromise between the strictly artistic and the more general taste:\"                                       PROGRAM          I.

The  second group begins with a taking Kreisler novelty, which is succeeded  by another slow number; but one very effective in its working-up; and I  end my program with a brilliant virtuoso number.                                     VIOLIN MASTERY    \"My own personal conception of violin mastery,\" concluded Mr. Brown,  \"might be defined as follows: 'An individual tone production, or rather  tone quality, consummate musicianship in phrasing and interpretation,  ability to rise above all mechanical and intellectual effort, and  finally the power to express that which is dictated by one's imagination  and emotion, with the same natural simplicity and spontaneity with which  the thought of a really great orator is expressed in the easy,  unconstrained flow of his language.'\"                                             IV                                    MISCHA ELMAN                        LIFE AND COLOR IN INTERPRETATION.                               TECHNICAL PHASES      To hear Mischa Elman on the concert platform, to listen to him play,  \"with all that wealth of tone, emotion and impulse which places him in  the very foremost rank of living violinists,\" should be joy enough for  any music lover. To talk with him in his own home, however, gives one a  deeper insight into his art as an interpreter; and in the pleasant  intimacy of familiar conversation the writer learned much that the  serious student of the violin will be interested in knowing.                [Illustration: MISCHA ELMAN, with hand-written note]                                MANNERISMS IN PLAYING    We all know that Elman, when he plays in public, moves his head, moves  his body, sways in time to the music; in a word there are certain  mannerisms associated with his playing which critics have on occasion  mentioned with grave suspicion, as evidences of sensationalism. Half  fearing to insult him by asking whether he was \"sincere,\" or whether his  motions were \"stage business\" carefully rehearsed, as had been implied,  I still ventured the question. He laughed boyishly and was evidently  much amused.    \"No, no,\" he said. \"I do not study up any 'stage business' to help out  my playing! I do not know whether I ought to compare myself to a dancer,  but the appeal of the dance is in all musical movement. Certain rhythms  and musical combinations affect me subconsciously. I suppose the direct  influence of the music on me is such that there is a sort of emotional  reflex: I move with the music in an unconscious translation of it into  gesture. It is all so individual. The French violinists as a rule play  very correctly in public, keeping their eye on finger and bow. And this  appeals to me strongly in theory. In practice I seem to get away from  it. It is a matter of temperament I presume. I am willing to believe I'm  not graceful, but then--I do not know whether I move or do not move!  Some of my friends have spoken of it to me at various times, so I  suppose I do move, and sway and all the rest; but any movements of the  sort must be unconscious, for I myself know nothing of them. And the  idea that they are 'prepared' as 'stage effects' is delightful!\" And  again Elman laughed.                          LIFE AND COLOR IN INTERPRETATION    \"For that matter,\" he continued, \"every real artist has some mannerisms  when playing, I imagine. Yet"]]]
