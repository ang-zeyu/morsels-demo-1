An interesting fact about Manjusri is his association with China,[47]  not only in Chinese but in late Indian legends. The mountain  Wu-t'ai-shan in the province of Shan-si is sacred to him and is  covered with temples erected in his honour.[48] The name (mountain of  five terraces) is rendered in Sanskrit as Pancasirsha, or Pancasikha,  and occurs both in the Svayambhu Purana and in the text appended to  miniatures representing Manjusri. The principal temple is said to have  been erected between 471 and 500 A.D. I have not seen any statement  that the locality was sacred in pre-Buddhist times, but it was  probably regarded as the haunt of deities, one of whom--perhaps some  spirit of divination--was identified with the wise Manjusri. It is  possible that during the various inroads of Graeco-Bactrians,  Yueeh-Chih, and other Central Asian tribes into India, Manjusri was  somehow imported into the pantheon of the Mahayana from China or  Central Asia, and he has, especially in the earlier descriptions, a  certain pure and abstract quality which recalls the Amesha-Spentas of  Persia. But still his attributes are Indian, and there is little  positive evidence of a foreign origin. I-Ching is the first to tell us  that the Hindus believed he came from China.[49] Hsuean Chuang does not  mention this belief, and probably did not hear of it, for it is an  interesting detail which no one writing for a Chinese audience would  have omitted. We may therefore suppose that the idea arose in India  about 650 A.D. By that date the temples of Wu-t'ai-Shan would have had  time to become celebrated, and the visits paid to India by  distinguished Chinese Buddhists would be likely to create the  impression that China was a centre of the faith and frequented by  Bodhisattvas.[50] We hear that Vajrabodhi (about 700) and Prajna (782)  both went to China to adore Manjusri. In 824 a Tibetan envoy arrived  at the Chinese Court to ask for an image of Manjusri, and later the  Grand Lamas officially recognized that he was incarnate in the  Emperor.[51] Another legend relates that Manjusri came from  Wu-t'ai-Shan to adore a miraculous lotus[52] that appeared on the lake  which then filled Nepal. With a blow of his sword he cleft the  mountain barrier and thus drained the valley and introduced  civilization. There may be hidden in this some tradition of the  introduction of culture into Nepal but the Nepalese legends are late  and in their collected form do not go back beyond the sixteenth  century.    After Avalokita and Manjusri the most important Bodhisattva is  Maitreya,[53] also called Ajita or unconquered, who is the only one  recognized by the Pali Canon.[54] This is because he does not stand on  the same footing as the others. They are superhuman in their origin as  well as in their career, whereas Maitreya is simply a being who like  Gotama has lived innumerable lives and ultimately made himself worthy  of Buddhahood which he awaits in heaven. There is no reason to doubt  that Gotama regarded himself as one in a series of Buddhas: the Pali  scriptures relate that he mentioned his predecessors by name, and also  spoke of unnumbered Buddhas to come.[55] Nevertheless Maitreya or  Metteyya is rarely mentioned in the Pali Canon.[56]    He is, however, frequently alluded to in the exegetical Pali  literature, in the Anagata-vamsa and in the earlier Sanskrit works  such as the Lalita-vistara, the Divyavadana and Mahavastu. In the  Lotus he plays a prominent part, but still is subordinate to Manjusri.  Ultimately he was eclipsed by the two great Bodhisattvas but in the  early centuries of our era he received much respect. His images are  frequent in all parts of the Buddhist world: he was believed to watch  over the propagation of the Faith,[57] and to have made special  revelations to Asanga.[58] In paintings he is usually of a golden  colour: his statues, which are often gigantic, show him standing or  sitting in the European fashion and not cross-legged. He appears to be  represented in the earliest Gandharan sculptures and there was a  famous image of him in Udyana of which Fa-Hsien (399-414 A.D.) speaks  as if it were already ancient.[59] Hsuean Chuang describes it as well  as a stupa erected[60] to commemorate Sakyamuni's prediction that  Maitreya would be his successor. On attaining Buddhahood he will  become lord of a terrestrial paradise and hold three assemblies under  a dragon flower tree,[61] at which all who have been good Buddhists in  previous births will become Arhats. I-Ching speaks of meditating on  the advent of Maitreya in language like that which Christian piety  uses of the second coming of Christ and concludes a poem which is  incorporated in his work with the aspiration \"Deep as the depth of a  lake be my pure and calm meditation. Let me look for the first  meeting under the Tree of the Dragon Flower when I hear the deep  rippling voice of the Buddha Maitreya.\"[62] But messianic ideas were  not much developed in either Buddhism or Hinduism and perhaps the  figures of both Maitreya and Kalki owe something to Persian legends  about Saoshyant the Saviour.    The other Bodhisattvas, though lauded in special treatises, have left  little impression on Indian Buddhism and have obtained in the Far East  most of whatever importance they possess. The makers of images and  miniatures assign to each his proper shape and colour, but when we  read about them we feel that we are dealing not with the objects of  real worship or even the products of a lively imagination, but with  names and figures which have a value for picturesque but conventional  art.    Among the best known is Samantabhadra, the all gracious,[63] who is  still a popular deity in Tibet and the patron saint of the sacred  mountain Omei in China, with which he is associated as Manjusri with  Wu-tai-shan. He is represented as green and riding on an elephant. In  Indian Buddhism he has a moderately prominent position. He is  mentioned in the Dharmasangraha and in one chapter of the Lotus he is  charged with the special duty of protecting those who follow the law.  But the Chinese pilgrims do not mention his worship.    Mahasthamaprapta[64] is a somewhat similar figure. A chapter of the  Lotus (XIX) is dedicated to him without however giving any clear idea  of his personality and he is extolled in several descriptions of  Sukhavati or Paradise, especially in the Amitayurdhyana-sutra.  Together with Amitabha and Avalokita he forms a triad who rule this  Happy Land and are often represented by three images in Chinese  temples.    Vajrapani is mentioned in many lists of Bodhisattvas (_e.g._ in the  Dharmasangraha) but is of somewhat doubtful position as Hsuean Chuang  calls him a deva.[65] Historically his recognition as a Bodhisattva is  interesting for he is merely Indra transformed into a Buddhist. The  mysterious personages called Vajradhara and Vajrasattva, who in later  times are even identified with the original Buddha spirit, are further  developments of Vajrapani. He owes his elevation to the fact that  _Vajra_, originally meaning simply thunderbolt, came to be used as a  mystical expression for the highest truth.    More important than these is Kshitigarbha, Ti-tsang or Jizo[66] who in  China and Japan ranks second only to Kuan-yin. Visser has consecrated  to him an interesting monograph[67] which shows what strange changes  and chances may attend spirits and how ideal figures may alter as  century after century they travel from land to land. We know little  about the origin of Kshitigarbha. The name seems to mean Earth-womb  and he has a shadowy counterpart in Akasagarbha, a similar deity of  the air, who it seems never had a hold on human hearts. The Earth is  generally personified as a goddess[68] and Kshitigarbha has some  slight feminine traits, though on the whole decidedly masculine. The  stories of his previous births relate how he was twice a woman: in  Japan he was identified with the mountain goddess of Kamado, and he  helps women in labour, a boon generally accorded by goddesses. In the  pantheon of India he played an inconspicuous part,[69] though reckoned  one of the eight great Bodhisattvas, but met with more general esteem  in Turkestan, where he began to collect the attributes afterwards  defined in the Far East. It is there that his history and  transformations become clear.    He is primarily a deity of the nether world, but like Amitabha and  Avalokita he made a vow to help all living creatures and specially to  deliver them from hell. The Taoists pictured hell as divided into ten  departments ruled over by as many kings, and Chinese fancy made  Ti-tsang the superintendent of these functionaries. He thus becomes  not so much a Saviour as the kindly superintendent of a prison who  preaches to the inmates and willingly procures their release. Then we  hear of six Ti-tsangs, corresponding to the six worlds of sentient  beings, the gracious spirit being supposed to multiply his personality  in order to minister to the wants of all. He is often represented as a  monk, staff in hand and with shaven head. The origin of this guise is  not clear and it perhaps refers to his previous births. But in the  eighth century a monk of Chiu Hua[70] was regarded as an incarnation  of Ti-tsang and after death his body was gilded and enshrined as an  object of worship. In later times the Bodhisattva was confused with  the incarnation, in the same way as the portly figure of Pu-tai,  commonly known as the laughing Buddha, has been substituted for  Maitreya in Chinese iconography.    In Japan the cult of the six Jizos became very popular. They were  regarded as the deities of roads[71] and their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16572"],[0,"Indians of the Yosemite Valley and Vicinity (#5)"],[1," He wears a false deer's head, to deceive the game.]    When on the still hunt for deer in the brushy, sparsely timbered  foothills of the Sierra Range of mountains, or higher up in the  extensive forests, some of the hunters wore for a headgear a  false deer's head, by which deceptive device they were enabled to  get to a closer and more effective range with their bows and  arrows. This head-dress was made of the whole skin of a doe's  head, with a part of the neck, the head part stuffed with light  material, the eyeholes filled in with the green feathered scalp  of a duck's head, and the top furnished with light wooden horns,  the branching stems of the manzanita (_Arctostaphylos_) being  generally used for this purpose. The neck part was made to fit on  the hunter's head and fasten with strings tied under the chin.  This unique style of headgear was used by some Indian hunters for  many years after they had guns to hunt with.    [Illustration: _Drawing by Jorgensen_  INDIAN SWEAT HOUSE.  Used by the Yosemite hunters before starting after game.]    The high ranges of the mountains, as already stated, were  considered common hunting ground by the different tribes. The  deer, many of them, were in some degree migratory in their  habits, being driven from the higher ranges to the foothills by  the deep winter snows, and in the spring following close to the  melting, receding snow, back again to their favorite summer  haunts.    Late in the summer, or early in the fall, just before holding  some of their grand social or sacred festivals, the Indian  hunters would make preparation for a big hunt in the mountains,  to get a good supply of venison for the feast. One of the first  absolute prerequisites was to go through a thorough course of  sweating and personal cleansing. This was done by resorting to  their sweat houses, which were similar in construction to the  _o'-chums_, except that the top was rounded and the whole  structure was covered thickly with mud and earth to exclude the  air. These houses were heated with hot stones and coals of fire,  and the hunters would then crawl into them and remain until in a  profuse perspiration, when they would come out and plunge into  cold water for a wash-off. This was repeated until they thought  themselves sufficiently free from all bodily odor so that the  deer could not detect their approach by scent, and flee for  safety.    After this purification they kept themselves strictly as  celibates until the hunt was over, though their women went along  to help carry the outfit, keep camp, cook, search for berries and  pine nuts, and assist in bringing to camp and taking care of the  deer as killed, and in \"packing\" the meat out to the place of  rendezvous appointed for the grand ceremonies and feast.    Their usual manner of cooking fresh meat was by broiling on hot  coals, or roasting before the fire or in the embers. Sometimes,  however, they made a cavity in the ground, in which they built a  fire, which was afterwards cleared away and the cavity lined with  very hot stones, on which they placed the meat wrapped in green  herbage, and covered it with other hot rocks and earth, to remain  until suitably cooked.    When they had a surplus of fresh meat they cut it in strips and  hung it in the sun-shine to dry. The dried meat was generally  cooked by roasting in hot embers, and then beaten to soften it  before being eaten.    A young hunter never ate any of the first deer he killed, as he  believed that if he did so he would never succeed in killing  another.      FISHING.    They had various methods of catching fish--with hook and line,  with a spear, by weir-traps in the stream, and by saturating the  water with the juice of the soap-root plant (_Chlorogalum  pomeridianum_). Before they could obtain fishhooks of modern  make, they made them of bone. Their lines were made of the tough,  fibrous, silken bark of the variety of milkweed or silkweed,  already mentioned. Their spears were small poles pointed with a  single tine of bone, which was so arranged that it became  detached by the struggles of the fish, and was then held by a  string fastened near its center, which turned it crosswise of the  wound and made it act as an effective barb.    Their weir-traps were put in the rapids, and constructed by  building wing dams diagonally down to the middle of the stream  until the two ends came near together, and in this narrow outlet  was placed a sort of wicker basket trap, made of long willow  sprouts loosely woven together and closed at the pointed lower  end, which was elevated above the surface of the water below the  dam. The fish, in going down stream, ran into this trap, and soon  found themselves at the lower end and out of the water.    The soap-root was used at a low stage of water, late in summer.  They dug several bushels of the bulbous roots and went to a  suitable place on the bank, where the roots were pounded into a  pulp, and mixed with soil and water. This mixture, by the  handful, was then rubbed on rocks out in the stream, which roiled  the water and also made it somewhat foamy. The fish were soon  affected by it, became stupid with a sort of strangulation, and  rose to the surface, where they were easily captured by the  Indians with their scoop baskets. In a stream the size of the  South Fork of the Merced River at Wawona, by this one operation  every fish in it for a distance of three miles would be taken in  a few hours.    The fish were generally cooked by roasting on hot coals from  burned oak wood or bark.      ACORNS AS FOOD.    Acorns were their main staple article of breadstuff, and they are  still used by the present generation whenever they can be  obtained.    [Illustration: _Drawing by Mrs. Jorgensen._  CHUCK'-AH.  Storehouse for nuts and acorns, thatched with pine branches,  points downward, to keep out mice and squirrels.]    They are gathered in the fall when ripe and are preserved for  future use in the old style Indian _cache_ or storehouse. This  consists of a structure which they call a _chuck'-ah_, which is  a large basket-shaped receptacle made of long willow sprouts  closely woven together. It is usually about six feet high and  three feet in diameter. It is set upon stout posts about three  feet high and supported in position by four longer posts on the  outside, reaching to the top, and there bound firmly to keep them  from spreading. The outside of the basket is thatched with small  pine branches, points downward, to shed the rain and snow, and to  protect the contents from the depredations of squirrels and  woodpeckers. When filled, the top also is securely covered with  bark, as a protection from the winter storms. When the acorns are  wanted for use, a small hole is made at the bottom of the  _chuck'-ah_, and they are taken out from time to time as  required.    The acorns from the black or Kellogg's oak (_Quercus  Californica_) are considered much the best and most nutritious  by the Indians. This is the oak which is so beautiful and  abundant in the Yosemite Valley.    These acorns are quite bitter, and are not eaten in their natural  condition, as most fruit and nuts are eaten, but have to be quite  elaborately prepared and cooked to make them palatable. First,  the hull is cracked and removed, and the kernel pounded or ground  into a fine meal. In the Yosemite Valley and at other Indian  camps in the mountains, this is done by grinding with their stone  pestles or _metats (may-tat's)_ in the _ho'yas_ or mortars,  worn by long usage in large flat-top granite rocks, one of which  is near every Indian camp. Lower down in the foothills, where  there are no suitable large rocks for these permanent mortars,  the Indians used single portable stone mortars for this purpose.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Fiske_.  HO'-YAS AND ME-TATS'.  Rude mortars and pestles for grinding acorn meal. The holes have  been worn in the granite by constant use.]    After the acorns are ground to a fine meal, the next process is  to take out the bitter tannin principle. This is done in the  following manner: They make large shallow basins in clean washed  sand, in the center of which are laid a few flat, fan-like ends  of fir branches. A fire is then made near by, and small stones  of four or five pounds in weight are heated, with which they warm  water in some of their large cooking baskets, and mix the acorn  meal with it to the consistency of thin gruel. This mixture is  poured into the sand basins, and as the water leaches out into  the sand it takes with it the bitter quality--the warm water  being renewed until all the bitter taste is washed out from the  meal sediment, or dough.    This is then taken, and, after being cleansed from the adhering  sand, is put into cooking baskets, thinned down with hot water to  the desired condition, and cooked by means of hot stones which  are held in it with two sticks for tongs. The mush, while  cooking, is stirred with a peculiar stirring stick, made of a  tough oak sprout, doubled so as to form a round, open loop at one  end, which is used in lifting out any loose stones. When the  dough is well cooked, it is either left _en masse_ in the basket  or scooped out in rolls and put into cold water to cool and  warden before being eaten. Sometimes the thick paste is made into  cakes and baked on hot rocks. One of these cakes, when rolled in  paper, will in a short time saturate it with oil. This acorn  food is probably more nutritious than any of the cereals.      INDIAN DOGS.    The Indian dogs, of which every family had several, are as fond  of the acorn food as their owners. These dogs are made useful in  treeing wild-cats, California lions and gray squirrels, and are  very expert in catching ground squirrels by intercepting them  when away from their burrows, and when the Indians drown them out  in the early spring by turning water from the flooded streams  into their holes.
