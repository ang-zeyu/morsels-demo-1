If  you will take the lamp, I will go on in front. We shall take the  straight road here, and we shall meet no one.'    'It seems to me that some one is coming behind us,' said Gerda, as she  fancied something rushed past her, throwing a shadow on the walls;  horses with flowing manes and slender legs; huntsmen, ladies and  gentlemen on horseback.    'Oh, those are only the dreams!' said the crow; 'they come to take the  thoughts of the noble ladies and gentlemen out hunting. That's a good  thing, for you will be able to see them all the better in bed. But don't  forget, when you are taken into favour, to show a grateful spirit.'    'Now, there's no need to talk about that,' said the crow from the woods.    They came now into the first apartment; it was hung with rose-coloured  satin embroidered with flowers. Here again the dreams overtook them, but  they flitted by so quickly that Gerda could not distinguish them. The  apartments became one more beautiful than the other; they were enough to  bewilder anybody. They now reached the bedroom. The ceiling was like a  great palm with crystal leaves, and in the middle of the room two beds,  each like a lily hung from a golden stem. One was white, and in it lay  the Princess; the other was red, and there lay he whom Gerda had come to  seek--little Kay! She bent aside one of the crimson leaves, and she saw  a little brown neck. It was Kay. She called his name aloud, and held the  lamp close to him. Again the dreams rushed through the room on  horseback--he awoke, turned his head--and it was not little Kay.    It was only the Prince's neck which was like his; but he was young and  handsome. The Princess peeped out of her lily-white bed, and asked what  was the matter. Then little Gerda cried and told them all her story, and  what the crows had done to help her.    'You poor little thing!' said the Prince and Princess. And they praised  the crows, and said that they were not at all angry with them, but they  must not do it again. Then they gave them a reward.    'Would you like your liberty?' said the Princess, 'or would you prefer  permanent posts about the court as court crows, with perquisites from  the kitchen?'    Both crows curtsied and begged for the permanent posts, for they thought  of their old age, and said 'it was so good to have something for the old  man,' as they called it.    The Prince got up and allowed Gerda to sleep in his bed, and he could  not have done more. She folded her little hands, and thought 'how good  the people and the animals are'; then she shut her eyes and fell fast  asleep. All the dreams came flying back again; this time they looked  like angels, and they were dragging a little sledge with Kay sitting on  it, and he nodded. But it was only a dream; so it all vanished when she  woke.    Next day she was dressed in silk and velvet from head to foot; they  asked her to stay at the Palace and have a good time, but she only  begged them to give her a little carriage and horse, and a little pair  of boots, so that she might drive out into the wide world to look for  Kay.    They gave her a pair of boots and a muff. She was beautifully dressed,  and when she was ready to start, there before the door stood a new  chariot of pure gold. The Prince's and Princess's coat of arms were  emblazoned on it, and shone like a star. Coachman, footman, and  outrider, for there was even an outrider, all wore golden crowns. The  Prince and Princess themselves helped her into the carriage and wished  her joy. The wood crow, who was now married, accompanied her for the  first three miles; he sat beside Gerda, for he could not ride with his  back to the horses. The other crow stood at the door and flapped her  wings; she did not go with them, for she suffered from headache since  she had become a kitchen pensioner--the consequence of eating too much.  The chariot was stored with sugar biscuits, and there were fruit and  ginger nuts under the seat. 'Good-bye, good-bye,' cried the Prince and  Princess; little Gerda wept, and the crow wept too. At the end of the  first few miles the crow said good-bye, and this was the hardest parting  of all. It flew up into a tree and flapped its big black wings as long  as it could see the chariot, which shone like the brightest sunshine.

FIFTH STORY    THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL    [Illustration: _'It is gold, it is gold!' they cried._]    They drove on through a dark wood, where the chariot lighted up the way  and blinded the robbers by its glare; it was more than they could bear.    'It is gold, it is gold!' they cried, and darting forward, seized the  horses, and killed the postilions, the coachman, and footman. They then  dragged little Gerda out of the carriage.    'She is fat, and she is pretty; she has been fattened on nuts!' said the  old robber woman, who had a long beard, and eyebrows that hung down over  her eyes. 'She is as good as a fat lamb, and how nice she will taste!'  She drew out her sharp knife as she said this; it glittered horribly.  'Oh!' screamed the old woman at the same moment, for her little daughter  had come up behind her, and she was biting her ear. She hung on her  back, as wild and as savage a little animal as you could wish to find.  'You bad, wicked child!' said her mother, but she was prevented from  killing Gerda on this occasion.    'She shall play with me,' said the little robber girl; 'she shall give  me her muff, and her pretty dress, and she shall sleep in my bed.' Then  she bit her mother again and made her dance. All the robbers laughed and  said, 'Look at her dancing with her cub!'    'I want to get into the carriage,' said the little robber girl, and she  always had her own way because she was so spoilt and stubborn. She and  Gerda got into the carriage, and then they drove over stubble and stones  further and further into the wood. The little robber girl was as big as  Gerda, but much stronger; she had broader shoulders, and darker skin,  her eyes were quite black, with almost a melancholy expression. She put  her arm round Gerda's waist and said--    'They shan't kill you as long as I don't get angry with you; you must  surely be a Princess!'    'No,' said little Gerda, and then she told her all her adventures, and  how fond she was of Kay.    The robber girl looked earnestly at her, gave a little nod, and said,  'They shan't kill you even if I am angry with you. I will do it myself.'  Then she dried Gerda's eyes, and stuck her own hands into the pretty  muff, which was so soft and warm.    At last the chariot stopped: they were in the courtyard of a robber's  castle, the walls of which were cracked from top to bottom. Ravens and  crows flew in and out of every hole, and big bulldogs, which each looked  ready to devour somebody, jumped about as high as they could, but they  did not bark, for it was not allowed. A big fire was burning in the  middle of the stone floor of the smoky old hall. The smoke all went up  to the ceiling, where it had to find a way out for itself. Soup was  boiling in a big caldron over the fire, and hares and rabbits were  roasting on the spits.    'You shall sleep with me and all my little pets to-night,' said the  robber girl.    When they had something to eat and drink they went along to one corner  which was spread with straw and rugs. There were nearly a hundred  pigeons roosting overhead on the rafters and beams. They seemed to be  asleep, but they fluttered about a little when the children came in.    'They are all mine,' said the little robber girl, seizing one of the  nearest. She held it by the legs and shook it till it flapped its wings.  'Kiss it,' she cried, dashing it at Gerda's face. 'Those are the wood  pigeons,' she added, pointing to some laths fixed across a big hole high  up on the walls; 'they are a regular rabble; they would fly away  directly if they were not locked in. And here is my old sweetheart Be,'  dragging forward a reindeer by the horn; it was tied up, and it had a  bright copper ring round its neck. 'We have to keep him close too, or he  would run off. Every single night I tickle his neck with my bright  knife, he is so frightened of it.' The little girl produced a long knife  out of a hole in the wall and drew it across the reindeer's neck. The  poor animal laughed and kicked, and the robber girl laughed and pulled  Gerda down into the bed with her.    'Do you have that knife by you while you are asleep?' asked Gerda,  looking rather frightened.    'I always sleep with a knife,' said the little robber girl. 'You never  know what will happen. But now tell me again what you told me before  about little Kay, and why you went out into the world.' So Gerda told  her all about it again, and the wood pigeons cooed up in their cage  above them; the other pigeons were asleep. The little robber girl put  her arm round Gerda's neck and went to sleep with the knife in her other  hand, and she was soon snoring. But Gerda would not close her eyes; she  did not know whether she was to live or to die. The robbers sat round  the fire, eating and drinking, and the old woman was turning  somersaults. This sight terrified the poor little girl. Then the wood  pigeons said, 'Coo, coo, we have seen little Kay; his sledge was drawn  by a white chicken, and he was sitting in the Snow Queen's sledge; it  was floating low down over the trees, while we were in our nests. She  blew upon us young ones, and they all died except we two; coo, coo.'    'What are you saying up there?' asked Gerda. 'Where was the Snow Queen  going? Do you know anything about it?'    'She was most likely going to Lapland, because there is always snow and  ice there! Ask the reindeer who is tied up there.'

But if  there's any doubt in your mind as to my qualifications, you can check  with Colonel Taylor, at the State Museum, or with the editor of the  _American Rifleman_.\"    \"I see.\" Goode nodded. \"And as you point out, being a sort of  non-professional expert, you should be free from mercenary bias.\" He  nodded again, taking off his glasses and polishing them on an outsize  white handkerchief. \"Frankly, now that I understand your purpose, Mr.  Rand, I must say that I am quite glad that Mrs. Fleming took this step.  I was perplexed about how to deal with that collection. I realized that  it was worth a great deal of money, but I haven't the vaguest idea how  much, or how it could be sold to the best advantage.... At a rough guess,  Mr. Rand, how much do you think it ought to bring?\"    Rand shook his head. \"I only saw it twice, the last time two years ago.  Ask me that after I've spent a day or so going over it, and I'll be able  to give you an estimate. I will say this, though: It's probably worth a  lot more than the ten thousand dollars Arnold Rivers has offered for it.\"    That produced an unexpected effect. Goode straightened in his chair,  gobbling in surprised indignation.    \"Arnold Rivers? Has he had the impudence to try to buy the collection?\"  he demanded. \"Where did you hear that?\"    \"From Mrs. Fleming. I understand he made the offer to Fred Dunmore.  That's his business, isn't it?\"    \"I believe the colloquial term is 'racket,'\" Goode said. \"Why, that man  is a notorious swindler! Mr. Rand, do you know that only a week before  his death, Mr. Fleming instructed me to bring suit against him, and also  to secure his indictment on criminal charges of fraud?\"    \"I didn't know that, but I'm not surprised,\" Rand answered. \"What did he  burn Fleming with?\"    \"Here; I'll show you.\" Goode rose from his seat and went to a rank of  steel filing-cabinets behind the desk. In a moment, he was back, with a  large manila envelope under his arm, and a huge pistol in either hand.  \"Here, Mr. Rand,\" he chuckled. \"We'll just test your firearms knowledge.  What do you make of these?\"    Rand took the pistols and looked at them. They were wheel locks,  apparently sixteenth-century South German; they were a good two feet in  over-all length, with ball-pommels the size of oranges, and long steel  belt-hooks. The stocks were so covered with ivory inlay that the wood  showed only in tiny interstices; the metal-work was lavishly engraved and  gold-inlaid. To the trigger-guards were attached tags marked _Fleming vs.  Rivers_.    Rand examined each pistol separately, then compared them. Finally, he  took a six-inch rule from his pocket and made measurements, first with  one edge and then with the other.    \"Well, I'm damned,\" he said, laying them on the desk. \"These things are  the most complete fakes I ever saw--locks, stocks, barrels and mountings.  They're supposed to be late sixteenth-century; I doubt if they were made  before 1920. As far as I can see or measure, there isn't the slightest  difference between them, except on some of the decorative inlay. The  whole job must have been miked in ten-thousandths, and what's more,  whoever made them used metric measurements. You'll find pairs of English  dueling pistols as early as 1775 that are almost indistinguishable, but  in 1575, when these things were supposed to have been made, a gunsmith  was working fine when he was working in sixteenth-inches. They just  didn't have the measuring instruments, at that time, to do closer work.  I won't bother taking these things apart, but if I did, I'd bet all  Wall Street to Junior's piggy-bank that I'd find that the screws were  machine-threaded and the working-parts interchanged. I've heard about  fakes like these,\"--he named a famous, recently liquidated West Coast  collection--\"but I'd never hoped to see an example like this.\"    Goode gave a hacking chuckle. \"You'll do as an arms-expert, Mr. Rand,\" he  said. \"And you'd win the piggy-bank. It seems that after Mr. Fleming  bought them, he took them apart, and found, just as you say, that the  screw-threads had been machine-cut, and that the working-parts were  interchangeable from one pistol to the other. There were a lot of papers  accompanying them--I have them here--purporting to show that they had  been sold by some Austrian nobleman, an anti-Nazi refugee, in whose  family they had been since the reign of Maximilian II. They are, of  course, fabrications. I looked up the family in the _Almanach de Gotha_;  it simply never existed. At first, Mr. Fleming had been inclined to take  the view that Rivers had been equally victimized with himself. However,  when Rivers refused to take back the pistols and refund the purchase  price, he altered his opinion. He placed them in my hands, instructing me  to bring suit and also start criminal action; he was in a fearful rage  about it, and swore that he'd drive Rivers out of business. However,  before I could start action, Mr. Fleming was killed in that accident, and  as he was the sole witness to the fact of the sale, and as none of the  heirs was interested, I did nothing about it. In fact, I advised them  that action against Rivers would cost the estate more than they could  hope to recover in damages.\" He picked up one of the pistols and examined  it. \"Now, I don't know what to do about these.\"    \"Take them home and hang them over the mantel,\" Rand advised. \"If I'm  going to have anything to do with selling the collection, I don't want  anything to do with them.\"    Goode was peering at the ivory inlay on the underbelly of the stock.    \"They are beautiful, and I don't care when they were made,\" he said. \"I  think, if nobody else wants them, I'll do just that.... Now, Mr. Rand,  what had you intended doing about the collection?\"    \"Well, that's what I came to see you about, Mr. Goode. As I understand  it, it is you who are officially responsible for selling the collection,  and the proceeds would be turned over to you for distribution to Mrs.  Fleming, Mrs. Dunmore and Mrs. Varcek. Is that correct?\"    \"Yes. The collection, although in the physical possession of Mrs.  Fleming, is still an undistributed asset.\"    \"I thought so.\" Rand got out Gladys Fleming's letter of authorization and  handed it to Goode. \"As you'll see by that, I was retained by, and only  by, Mrs. Fleming,\" he said. \"I am assuming that her interests are  identical with those of the other heirs, but I realize that this is true  only to a very limited extent. It's my understanding that relations  between the three ladies are not the most pleasant.\"    Goode produced a short, croaking laugh. \"Now there's a cautious  understatement,\" he commented. \"Mr. Rand, I feel that you should know  that all three hate each other poisonously.\"    \"That was rather my impression. Now, I expect some trouble, from Mrs.  Dunmore and/or Mrs. Varcek, either or both of whom are sure to accuse me  of having been brought into this by Mrs. Fleming to help her defraud the  others. That, of course, is not the case; they will all profit equally by  my participation in this. But I'm going to have trouble convincing them  of that.\"    \"Yes. You will,\" Goode agreed. \"Would you rather carry my authorization  than Mrs. Fleming's?\"    \"Yes, indeed, Mr. Goode. To tell the truth, that was why I came here,  for one reason. You will not be obligated in any way by authorizing me  to act as your agent--I'm getting my fee from Mrs. Fleming--but I would  be obligated to represent her only as far as her interests did not  improperly conflict with those of the other heirs, and that's what I  want made clear.\"    Goode favored the detective with a saurian smile. \"You're not a lawyer,  too, Mr. Rand?\" he asked.    \"Well, I am a member of the Bar in the State of Mississippi, though I  never practiced,\" Rand admitted. \"Instead of opening a law-office, I went  into the F.B.I., in 1935, and then opened a private agency a couple of  years later. But if I had to, which God forbid, I could go home tomorrow  and hang out my shingle.\"    \"You seem to have had quite an eventful career,\" Goode remarked, with a  queer combination of envy and disapproval. \"I understand that, until  recently, you were an officer in the Army Intelligence, too.... I'll have  your authorization to act for me made out immediately; to list and  appraise the collection, and to negotiate with prospective purchasers.  And by the way,\" he continued, \"did I understand you to say that you had  heard some of these silly rumors to the effect that Lane Fleming had  committed suicide?\"    \"Oh, that's what's always heard, under the circumstances,\" Rand shrugged.  \"A certain type of sensation-loving mind...\"    \"Mr. Rand, there is not one scintilla of truth in any of these scurrilous  stories!\" Goode declared, pumping up a fine show of indignation. \"The  Premix Company is in the best possible financial condition; a glance at  its books, or at its last financial statement, would show that. I ought  to know, I'm chairman of the board of directors. Just because there was  some talk of retrenchment, shortly before Mr. Fleming's death ...\"    \"Oh, no responsible person pays any attention to that sort of talk,\" Rand  comforted him. \"My armed-guard and armored-car service brings me into  contact with a lot of the local financial crowd. None of them is taking  these rumors seriously.\"    \"Well, of course, nobody wants the responsibility of starting a panic,  even a minor one, but people are talking, and it's hurting Premix on the  market,\" Goode gloomed. \"And now, people will hear of Mrs. Fleming's  having retained you, and will assume, just as I did at first, that you  are making some kind of an"]]]
