[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14375"],[0,"The Adventures of Grandfather Frog (#5)"],[1,"Frog had thought that  this was just an idle boast, but when he saw Farmer Brown's boy tickle  old Mr. Toad under his chin with a straw, while Mr. Toad sat perfectly  still and seemed to enjoy it, he knew that it was true.    Grandfather Frog had not come out of his hiding-place until after old  Mr. Toad had gone back across the Green Meadows and Farmer Brown's boy  had gone home for his supper. Then Grandfather Frog had climbed back on  his big green lily-pad and had sat there half the night without once  leading the chorus of the Smiling Pool with his great deep bass voice as  he usually did. He was thinking, thinking very hard. And now, this  bright, sunshiny morning, he was still thinking.    The fact is Grandfather Frog was beginning to wonder if perhaps, after  all, Mr. Toad was right. If the Great World had taught him how to make  friends with Farmer Brown's boy, there really must be some things worth  learning there. Not for the world would Grandfather Frog have admitted  to old Mr. Toad or to any one else that there was anything for him to  learn, for you know he is very old and by his friends is accounted very  wise. But right down in his heart he was beginning to think that perhaps  there were some things which he couldn't learn in the Smiling Pool. So  he sat and thought and thought. Suddenly he made up his mind.    \"Chugarum!\" said he. \"I'll do it!\"    \"Do what?\" asked Jerry Muskrat, who happened to be swimming past.    \"I'll go out and see for myself what this Great World my cousin, old Mr.  Toad, is so fond of talking about is like,\" replied Grandfather Frog.    \"Don't you do it,\" advised Jerry Muskrat. \"Don't you do anything so  foolish as that. You're too old, much too old, Grandfather Frog, to go  out into the Great World.\"    Now few old people like to be told that they are too old to do what they  please, and Grandfather Frog is no different from others. \"You just mind  your own affairs, Jerry Muskrat,\" he retorted sharply. \"I guess I know  what is best for me without being told. If my cousin, old Mr. Toad, can  take care of himself out in the Great World, I can. He isn't half so  spry as I am. I'm going, and that is all there is about it!\"    With that Grandfather Frog dived into the Smiling Pool, swam across to a  place where the bank was low, and without once looking back started  across the Green Meadows to see the Great World.          XI    GRANDFATHER FROG IS STUBBORN      \"Fee, fi, fe, fum!    Chug, chug, chugarum!\"      Grandfather actually had started out to see the Great World. Yes, Sir,  he had turned his back on the Smiling Pool, and nothing that Jerry  Muskrat could say made the least bit of difference. Grandfather Frog had  made up his mind, and when he does that, it is just a waste of time and  breath for any one to try to make him change it. You see Grandfather  Frog is stubborn. Yes, that is just the word--stubborn. He would see for  himself what this Great World was that his cousin, old Mr. Toad, talked  so much about and said was so much better than the Smiling Pool where  Grandfather Frog had spent his whole life.    \"If old Mr. Toad can take care of himself, I can take care of myself out  in the Great World,\" said Grandfather Frog, to himself as, with great  jumps, he started out on to the Green Meadows. \"I guess he isn't any  smarter than I am! He isn't half so spry as I am, and I can jump three  times as far as he can. I'll see for myself what this Great World is  like, and then I'll go back to the Smiling Pool and stay there the rest  of my life. Chugarum, how warm it is!\"    It was warm. Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun was smiling his broadest and  pouring his warmest rays down on the Green Meadows. The Merry Little  Breezes of Old Mother West Wind were taking a nap. You see, they had  played so hard early in the morning that they were tired. So there was  nobody and nothing to cool Grandfather Frog, and he just grew warmer and  warmer with every jump. He began to grow thirsty, and how he did long  for a plunge in the dear, cool Smiling Pool! But he was stubborn. He  wouldn't turn back, no matter how uncomfortable he felt. He _would_ see  the Great World if it killed him. So he kept right on, jump, jump, jump,  jump.    Grandfather Frog had been up the Laughing Brook and down the Laughing  Brook, where he could swim when he grew tired of traveling on the bank,  and where he could cool off whenever he became too warm, but never  before had he been very far away from water, and he found this a very  different matter. At first he had made great jumps, for that is what his  long legs were given him for; but the long grass bothered him, and after  a little the jumps grew shorter and shorter and shorter, and with every  jump he puffed and puffed and presently began to grunt. You see he never  before had made more than a few jumps at a time without resting, and his  legs grew tired in a very little while.    Now if Grandfather Frog had known as much about the Green Meadows as the  little people who live there all the time do, he would have taken the  Lone Little Path, where the going was easy. But he didn't. He just  started right out without knowing where he was going, and of course the  way was hard, very hard indeed. The grass was so tall that he couldn't  see over it, and the ground was so rough that it hurt his tender feet,  which were used to the soft, mossy bank of the Smiling Pool. He had gone  only a little way before he wished with all his might that he had never  thought of seeing the Great World. But he had said that he was going to  and he would, so he kept right on--jump, jump, rest, jump, jump, jump,  rest, jump, and then a long rest.    It was during one of these rests that he heard footsteps, and then a  dreadful sound that made cold chills run all over him. Sniff, sniff,  sniff! It was coming nearer. Grandfather Frog flattened himself down as  close to the ground as he could get. But it was of no use, no use at  all. The sniffing came nearer and nearer, and then right over him stood  Bowser the Hound! Bowser looked just as surprised as he felt. He put out  one paw and turned Grandfather Frog over on his back. Grandfather Frog  struggled to his feet and made two frightened jumps.    \"Bow, wow!\" cried Bowser and rolled him over again. Bowser thought it  great fun, but Grandfather Frog thought that his last day had come.          XII    GRANDFATHER FROG KEEPS ON      Grandfather Frog is old and wise,      But even age is foolish.    I'm sure you'll all agree with me      His stubbornness was mulish.      That his very last day had come Grandfather Frog was sure. He didn't  have the least doubt about it. Here he was at the mercy of Bowser the  Hound out on the Green Meadows far from the dear, safe Smiling Pool.  Every time he moved, Bowser flipped him over on his back and danced  around him, barking with joy. Every minute Grandfather Frog expected to  feel Bowser's terrible teeth, and he grew cold at the thought. When he  found that he couldn't get away, he just lay still. He was too tired  and frightened to do much of anything else, anyway.    Now when he lay still, he spoiled Bowser's fun, for it was seeing him  jump and kick his long legs that tickled Bowser so. Bowser tossed him up  in the air two or three times, but Grandfather Frog simply lay where he  fell without moving.    \"Bow, wow, wow!\" cried Bowser, in his great deep voice. Grandfather Frog  didn't so much as blink his great goggly eyes. Bowser sniffed him all  over.    \"I guess I've frightened him to death,\" said Bowser, talking to himself.  \"I didn't mean to do that. I just wanted to have some fun with him.\"  With that, Bowser took one more sniff and then trotted off to try to  find something more exciting. You see, he hadn't had the least intention  in the world of really hurting Grandfather Frog.    Grandfather Frog kept perfectly still until he was sure that Bowser was  nowhere near. Then he gave a great sigh of relief and crawled under a  big mullein leaf to rest, and think things over.    \"Chugarum, that was a terrible experience; it was, indeed!\" said he to  himself, shivering at the very thought of what he had been through.  \"Nothing like that ever happened to me in the Smiling Pool. I've always  said that the Smiling Pool is a better place in which to live than is  the Great World, and now I know it. The question is, what had I best do  now?\"    Now right down in his heart Grandfather Frog knew the answer. Of course  the best thing to do was to go straight back to the Smiling Pool as fast  as he could. But Grandfather Frog is stubborn. Yes, Sir, he certainly is  stubborn. And stubbornness is often just another name for foolishness.  He had told Jerry Muskrat that he was going out to see the Great World.  Now if he went back, Jerry would laugh at him.    \"I won't!\" said Grandfather Frog.    \"What won't you do?\" asked a voice so close to him that Grandfather Frog  made a long jump before he thought. You see, at the Smiling Pool he  always jumped at the least hint of danger, and because one jump always  took him into the water, he was always safe. But there was no water  here, and that jump took him right out where anybody passing could see  him. Then he turned around to see who had startled him so. It was Danny  Meadow Mouse.    \"I won't go back to the Smiling Pool until I have seen the Great World,\"  replied Grandfather Frog gruffly.    [Illustration: \"You won't see much of the Great World if you jump like  that every time you get a scare,\" said Danny. _Page 62._]    \"You won't see much of the Great World if you jump like that every time  you get a scare,\" said Danny, shaking his head. \"No, Sir, you won't see  much of the Great World, because one of these times you'll jump right  into the claws of old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk, or his cousin Redtail,  or Reddy Fox. You take my advice, Grandfather Frog, and go straight back  to the Smiling Pool.

Well if there have been no  backslidings or remissness in the procedure indicated, the following  physical results will follow:--    First the neophyte will take more pleasure in things spiritual and pure.  Gradually gross and material occupations will become not only uncraved  for or forbidden, but simply and literally repulsive to him.  He will  take more pleasure in the simple sensations of Nature--the sort of  feeling one can remember to have experienced as a child.  He will feel  more light-hearted, confident, happy.  Let him take care the sensation  of renewed youth does not mislead, or he will yet risk a fall into his  old baser life and even lower depths.  \"Action and Re-action are equal.\"    Now the desire for food will begin to cease.  Let it be left off  gradually--no fasting is required.  Take what you feel you require.  The  food craved for will be the most innocent and simple.  Fruit and milk  will usually be the best.  Then as till now, you have been simplifying  the quality of your food, gradually--very gradually--as you feel capable  of it diminish the quantity.  You will ask:  \"Can a man exist without  food?\"  No, but before you mock, consider the character of the process  alluded to.  It is a notorious fact that many of the lowest and simplest  organisms have no excretions.  The common guinea-worm is a very good  instance.  It has rather a complicated organism, but it has no  ejaculatory duct.  All it consumes--the poorest essences of the human  body--is applied to its growth and propagation.  Living as it does in  human tissue, it passes no digested food away.  The human neophyte, at a  certain stage of his development, is in a somewhat analogous condition,  with this difference or differences, that he does excrete, but it is  through the pores of his skin, and by those too enter other etherealized  particles of matter to contribute towards his support.*  Otherwise, all  the food and drink is sufficient only to keep in equilibrium those  \"gross\" parts of his physical body which still remain to repair their  cuticle-waste through the medium of the blood.  Later on, the process of  cell-development in his frame will undergo a change;  a change for the  better, the opposite of that in disease for the worse--he will become  all living and sensitive, and will derive nourishment from the Ether  (Akas).  But that epoch for our neophyte is yet far distant.    ---------  * He is in a state similar to the physical state of a fetus  before birth into the world.--G.M.  ---------    Probably, long before that period has arrived, other results, no less  surprising than incredible to the uninitiated will have ensued to give  our neophyte courage and consolation in his difficult task.  It would be  but a truism to repeat what has been again alleged (in ignorance of its  real rationale) by hundreds and hundreds of writers as to the happiness  and content conferred by a life of innocence and purity.  But often at  the very commencement of the process some real physical result,  unexpected and unthought of by the neophyte, occurs.  Some lingering  disease, hitherto deemed hopeless, may take a favourable turn; or he may  develop healing mesmeric powers himself;  or some hitherto unknown  sharpening of his senses may delight him.  The rationale of these things  is, as we have said, neither miraculous nor difficult of comprehension.  In the first place, the sudden change in the direction of the vital  energy (which, whatever view we take of it and its origin, is  acknowledged by all schools of philosophy as most recondite, and as the  motive power) must produce results of some kind.  In the second,  Theosophy shows, as we said before, that a man consists of several men  pervading each other, and on this view (although it is very difficult to  express the idea in language) it is but natural that the progressive  etherealization of the densest and most gross of all should leave the  others literally more at liberty.  A troop of horses may be blocked by a  mob and have much difficulty in fighting its way through;  but if every  one of the mob could be changed suddenly into a ghost, there would be  little to retard it.  And as each interior entity is more rare, active,  and volatile than the outer and as each has relation with different  elements, spaces, and properties of the Kosmos which are treated of in  other articles on Occultism, the mind of the reader may conceive--though  the pen of the writer could not express it in a dozen volumes--the  magnificent possibilities gradually unfolded to the neophyte.    Many of the opportunities thus suggested may be taken advantage of by  the neophyte for his own safety, amusement, and the good of those around  him;  but the way in which he does this is one adapted to his fitness--a  part of the ordeal he has to pass through, and misuse of these powers  will certainly entail the loss of them as a natural result.  The Itchcha  (or desire) evoked anew by the vistas they open up will retard or throw  back his progress.    But there is another portion of the Great Secret to which we must  allude, and which is now, for the first, in a long series of ages,  allowed to be given out to the world, as the hour for it is come.    The educated reader need not be reminded again that one of the great  discoveries which has immortalized the name of Darwin is the law that an  organism has always a tendency to repeat, at an analogous period in its  life, the action of its progenitors, the more surely and completely in  proportion to their proximity in the scale of life.  One result of this  is, that, in general, organized beings usually die at a period (on an  average) the same as that of their progenitors.  It is true that there  is a great difference between the actual ages at which individuals of  any species die.  Disease, accidents and famine are the main agents in  causing this.  But there is, in each species, a well-known limit within  which the Race-life lies, and none are known to survive beyond it.  This  applies to the human species as well as any other.  Now, supposing that  every possible sanitary condition had been complied with, and every  accident and disease avoided by a man of ordinary frame, in some  particular case there would still, as is known to medical men, come a  time when the particles of the body would feel the hereditary tendency  to do that which leads inevitably to dissolution, and would obey it.  It  must be obvious to any reflecting man that, if by any procedure this  critical climacteric could be once thoroughly passed over, the  subsequent danger of \"Death\" would be proportionally less as the years  progressed.  Now this, which no ordinary and unprepared mind and body  can do, is possible sometimes for the will and the frame of one who has  been specially prepared.  There are fewer of the grosser particles  present to feel the hereditary bias--there is the assistance of the  reinforced \"interior men\" (whose normal duration is always greater even  in natural death) to the visible outer shell, and there is the drilled  and indomitable Will to direct and wield the whole.*    -----------  * In this connection we may as well show what modern science, and  especially physiology has to say as to the power of the human will.  \"The force of will is a potent element in determining longevity.  This  single point must be granted without argument, that of two men every way  alike and similarly circumstanced, the one who has the greater courage  and grit will be longer-lived. One does not need to practice medicine  long to learn that men die who might just as well live if they resolved  to live, and that myriads who are invalids could become strong if they  had the native or acquired will to vow they would do so.  Those who have  no other quality favourable to life, whose bodily organs are nearly  all diseased, to whom each day is a day of pain, who are beset by  life-shortening influences, yet do live by will alone.\"  --Dr. George M. Beard.  -------------    From that time forward the course of the aspirant is clearer.  He has  conquered \"the Dweller of the Threshold\"--the hereditary enemy of his  race, and, though still exposed to ever-new dangers in his progress  towards Nirvana, he is flushed with victory, and with new confidence and  new powers to second it, can press onwards to perfection.    For, it must be remembered, that nature everywhere acts by Law, and that  the process of purification we have been describing in the visible  material body, also takes place in those which are interior, and not  visible to the scientist by modifications of the same process.  All is  on the change, and the metamorphoses of the more ethereal bodies  imitate, though in successively multiplied duration, the career of the  grosser, gaining an increasing wider range of relations with the  surrounding kosmos, till in Nirvana the most rarefied Individuality is  merged at last into the INFINITE TOTALITY.    From the above description of the process, it will be inferred why it is  that \"Adepts\" are so seldom seen in ordinary life; for, pari passu, with  the etherealization of their bodies and the development of their power,  grows an increasing distaste, and a so-to-speak, \"contempt\" for the  things of our ordinary mundane existence.  Like the fugitive who  successively casts away in his flight those articles which incommode his  progress, beginning with the heaviest, so the aspirant eluding \"Death\"  abandons all on which the latter can take hold.  In the progress of  Negation everything got rid of is a help.  As we said before, the adept  does not become \"immortal\" as the word is ordinarily understood. By or  about the"]]]
