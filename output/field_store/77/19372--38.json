The  thunder-oak has fallen, and I think the day is coming when there  shall not be a home in all Germany where the children are not  gathered around the green fir-tree to rejoice in the birth-night  of Christ.\"    So they took the little fir from its place, and carried it in  joyous procession to the edge of the glade, and laid it on the  sledge. The horses tossed their heads and drew their load bravely,  as if the new burden had made it lighter.    When they came to the house of Gundhar, he bade them throw open  the doors of the hall and set the tree in the midst of it. They  kindled lights among the branches until it seemed to be tangled  full of fire-flies. The children encircled it, wondering, and the  sweet odour of the balsam filled the house.    Then Winfried stood beside the chair of Gundhar, on the dais at  the end of the hall, and told the story of Bethlehem; of the babe  in the manger, of the shepherds on the hills, of the host of  angels and their midnight song. All the people listened, charmed  into stillness. But the boy Bernhard, on Irma's knee, folded by  her soft arm, grew restless as the story lengthened, and began to  prattle softly at his mother's ear.    \"Mother,\" whispered the child, \"why did you cry out so loud, when  the priest was going to send me to Valhalla?\"    \"Oh, hush, my child,\" answered the mother, and pressed him closer  to her side.    \"Mother,\" whispered the boy again, laying his finger on the stains  upon her breast, \"see, your dress is red! What are these stains?  Did some one hurt you?\"    The mother closed his mouth with a kiss. \"Dear, be still, and  listen!\"    The boy obeyed. His eyes were heavy with sleep. But he heard the  last words of Winfried as he spoke of the angelic messengers,  flying over the hills of Judea and singing as they flew. The child  wondered and dreamed and listened. Suddenly his face grew bright.  He put his lips close to Irma's cheek again.    \"Oh, mother!\" he whispered very low, \"do not speak. Do you hear  them? Those angels have come back again. They are singing now  behind the tree.\"    And some say that it was true; but others say that it was only  Gregor and his companions at the lower end of the hall, chanting  their Christmas hymn:    All glory be to God on high,  And to the earth be peace!  Good-will, henceforth, from heaven to men  Begin, and never cease."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16140"],[0,"The Curious Book of Birds (#5)"],[1,"AEolus from the fury of  winds and waters, was not safe while there was no place in all the world  for her to rest foot and weary wing. So the Kingfisher fluttered in with  the other birds and animals, a strange company! And there they lived  all together, Noah and his arkful of pets, for many weary days, while  the waters raged and the winds howled outside, and all the earth was  covered fathoms deep out of sight below the waves.    But after long weeks the storm ceased, and Father Noah opened the little  window in the ark and sent forth the Dove to see whether or not there  was land visible on which the ark might find rest. Now after he had sent  out the Dove, Noah looked about him at the other birds and animals which  crowded around him eagerly, for they were growing very restless from  their long confinement, and he said, \"Which of you is bravest, and will  dare follow our friend the Dove out into the watery world? Ah, here is  the Kingfisher. Little mother, you at least, reared among the winds and  waters, will not be afraid. Take wing, O Kingfisher, and see if the  earth be visible. Then return quickly and bring me faithful word of what  you find out yonder.\"    Day was just beginning to dawn when the Kingfisher, who was then as gray  as gray, flew out from the little window of the ark whence the Dove had  preceded her. But hardly had she left the safe shelter of Father Noah's  floating home, when there came a tremendous whirlwind which blew her  about and buffeted her until she was almost beaten into the waves,  which rolled endlessly over the face of the whole earth, covering the  high hills and the very mountains. The Kingfisher was greatly  frightened. She could not go back into the ark, for the little window  was closed, and there was no land anywhere on which she could take  refuge. Just think for a moment what a dreadful situation it was! There  was nothing for her to do but to fly up, straight up, out of reach from  the tossing waves and dashing spray.    The Kingfisher was fresh and vigorous, and her wings were strong and  powerful, for she had been resting long days in the quiet ark, eating  the provisions which Father Noah had thoughtfully prepared for his many  guests. So up, up she soared, above the very clouds, on into the blue  ether which lies beyond. And lo! as she did so, her sober gray dress  became a brilliant blue, the color caught from the azure of those clear  heights. Higher and higher she flew, feeling so free and happy after her  long captivity, that she quite forgot Father Noah and the errand upon  which she had been sent. Up and up she went, higher than the sun, until  at last she saw him rising far beneath her, a beautiful ball of fire,  more dazzling, more wonderful than she had ever guessed.    \"Hola!\" she cried, beside herself with joy at the sight. \"There is the  dear sun, whom I have not seen for many days. And how near, how  beautiful he is! I will fly closer still, now that I have come so near.  I will observe him in all his splendor, as no other bird, not even the  high-flying, sharp-eyed Eagle, has ever seen him.\"    And with that the foolish Kingfisher turned her course downward, with  such mad, headlong speed that she had scarcely time to feel what  terrible, increasing heat shot from the sun's rays, until she was so  close upon him that it was too late to escape. Oh, but that was a  dreadful moment! The feathers on her poor little breast were scorched  and set afire, and she seemed in danger not only of spoiling her  beautiful new blue dress but of being burned into a wretched little  cinder. Horribly frightened at her danger, the Kingfisher turned once  more, but this time toward the rolling waters which covered the earth.  Down, down she swooped, until with the hiss of burning feathers she  splashed into the cold wetness, putting out the fire which threatened to  consume her. Once, twice, thrice, she dipped into the grateful coolness,  flirting the drops from her blue plumage, now alas! sadly scorched.    When the pain of her burns was somewhat relieved she had time to think  what next she should do. She longed for rest, for refuge, for Father  Noah's gentle, caressing hand to which she had grown accustomed during  those stormy weeks of companionship in the ark. But where was Father  Noah? Where was the ark? On all the rolling sea of water there was no  movement of life, no sign of any human presence. Then the Kingfisher  remembered her errand, and how carelessly she had performed it. She had  been bidden to return quickly; but she had wasted many hours--she could  not tell how many--in her forgetful flight. And now she was to be  punished indeed, if she could not find her master and the ark of refuge.    The poor Kingfisher looked wildly about. She fluttered here and there,  backward and forward, over the weary stretch of waves, crying piteously  for her master. He did not answer; there was no ark to be found. The sun  set and the night came on, but still she sought eagerly from east to  west, from north to south, always in vain. She could never find what she  had so carelessly lost.    The truth is that during her absence the Dove, who had done her errand  faithfully, returned at last with the olive leaf which told of one spot  upon the earth's surface at last uncovered by the waves. Then the ark,  blown hither and thither by the same storm which had driven the  Kingfisher to fly upward into the ether-blue, had drifted far and far  to Mount Ararat, where it ran aground. And Father Noah, disembarking  with his family and all the assembled animals, had broken up the ark,  intending there to build him a house out of the materials from which it  was made. But this was many, many leagues from the place where the poor  Kingfisher, lonely and frightened, hovered about, crying piteously for  her master.    And even when the waters dried away, uncovering the earth in many  places, so that the Kingfisher could alight and build herself a nest,  she was never happy nor content, but to this day flies up and down the  water-ways of the world piping sadly, looking eagerly for her dear  master and for some traces of the ark which sheltered her. And the  reflection which she makes in the water below shows an azure-blue body,  like a reflection of the sky above, with some of the breast-feathers  scorched to a rusty red. And now you know how it all came about.          THE WREN WHO BROUGHT FIRE      Centuries and centuries ago, when men were first made, there was no such  thing as fire known in all the world. Folk had no fire with which to  cook their food, and so they were obliged to eat it raw; which was very  unpleasant, as you may imagine! There were no cheery fireplaces about  which to sit and tell stories, or make candy or pop corn. There was no  light in the darkness at night except the sun and moon and stars. There  were not even candles in those days, to say nothing of gas lamps or  electric lights. It is strange to think of such a world where even the  grown folks, like the children and the birds, had to go to bed at dusk,  because there was nothing else to do.    But the little birds, who lived nearer heaven than men, knew of the fire  in the sun, and knew also what a fine thing it would be for the tribes  without feathers if they could have some of the magic element.    One day the birds held a solemn meeting, when it was decided that men  must have fire. Then some one must fly up to the sun and bring a  firebrand thence. Who would undertake this dangerous errand? Already by  sad experience the Kingfisher had felt the force of the sun's heat,  while the Eagle and the Wren, in the famous flight which they had taken  together, had learned the same thing. The assembly of birds looked at  one another, and there was a silence.    \"I dare not go,\" said the Kingfisher, trembling at the idea; \"I have  been up there once, and the warning I received was enough to last me for  some time.\"    \"I cannot go,\" said the Peacock, \"for my plumage is too precious to  risk.\"    \"I ought not to go,\" said the Lark, \"for the heat might injure my pretty  voice.\"    \"I must not go,\" said the Stork, \"for I have promised to bring a baby to  the King's palace this evening.\"    \"I cannot go,\" said the Dove, \"for I have a nestful of little ones who  depend upon me for food.\"    \"Nor I,\" said the Sparrow, \"for I am afraid.\" \"Nor I!\" \"Nor I!\" \"Nor I!\"  echoed the other birds.    \"I _will_ not go,\" croaked the Owl, \"for I simply do not wish to.\"    Then up spoke the little Wren, who had been keeping in the background  of late, because he was despised for his attempt to deceive the birds  into electing him their king.    \"I will go,\" said the Wren. \"I will go and bring fire to men. I am of  little use here. No one loves me. Every one despises me because of the  trick which I played the Eagle, our King. No one will care if I am  injured in the attempt. I will go and try.\"    \"Bravely spoken, little friend,\" said the Eagle kindly. \"I myself would  go but that I am the King, and kings must not risk the lives upon which  hangs the welfare of their people. Go you, little Wren, and if you are  successful you will win back the respect of your brothers which you have  forfeited.\"    The brave little bird set out upon his errand without further words. And  weak and delicate though he was, he flew and he flew up and up so  sturdily that at last he reached the sun, whence he plucked a firebrand  and bore it swiftly in his beak back toward the earth. Like a falling  star the bright speck flashed through the air, drawing ever nearer and  nearer to the cool waters of Birdland and the safety which awaited him  there. The other birds gathered in a flock about their king and  anxiously watched the Wren's approach.    Suddenly the Robin cried out, \"Alas! He burns! He has caught fire!\" And  off darted the faithful little friend to help the Wren. Sure enough, a  spark from the blazing brand had fallen upon the"]]]
