This  city lay a few miles to the east of the modern city of Cairo.]    [Footnote 4: Every living thing possessed a KA or \"double,\" which was  the vital power of the heart and could live after the death of the  body.]    [Footnote 5: The Air-god, the son of Keb and Nut.]    The ceremonies that followed concerned the dressing of the statue of the  king and his food. Various kinds of bandlets and a collar were  presented, and the gift of each endowed the king in the Other World with  special qualities. The words recited by the priest as he offered these  and other gifts were highly symbolic, and were believed to possess great  power, for they brought the Double of the king back to this earth to  live in the statue, and each time they were repeated they renewed the  life of the king in the Other World.      II. The _Liturgy of Funerary Offerings_ was another all-important work.  The oldest form of it, which is found in the Pyramid Texts, proves that  even under the earliest dynasties the belief in the efficacy of  sacrifices and offerings was an essential of the Egyptian religion. The  opening ceremonies had for their object the purification of the deceased  by means of sprinkling with water in which salt, natron, and other  cleansing substances had been dissolved, and burning of incense. Then  followed the presentation of about one hundred and fifty offerings of  food of all kinds, fruit, flowers, vegetables, various kinds of wine,  seven kinds of precious ointments, wearing apparel of the kind suitable  for a king, &c. As each object was presented to the spirit of the king,  which was present in his statue in the Tuat Chamber of the tomb, the  priest recited a form of words, which had the effect of transmuting the  substance of the object into something which, when used or absorbed by  the king's spirit, renewed the king's life and maintained his existence  in the Other World. Every object was called the \"Eye of Horus,\" in  allusion to its life-giving qualities. The following extracts illustrate  the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings:    32. This libation is for thee, Osiris, this libation is for thee,  Unas.[1] (_Here offer cold water of the North._) It cometh forth before  thy son, cometh forth before Horus. I have come, I have brought unto  thee the Eye of Horus, that thy heart may be refreshed thereby. I have  brought it and have set it under thy sandals, and I present unto thee  that which flowed forth from thee. There shall be no stoppage to thy  heart whilst it is with thee, and the offerings that appear at the  command[2] shall appear at thy word of command. (_Recite four times._)    [Footnote 1: The king who is identified with Osiris.]    [Footnote 2: The deceased who possessed the words of power uttered in  the tomb the names of the offerings he required, and the offerings  appeared forthwith.]    37. Thou hast taken possession of the two Eyes of Horus, the White and  the Black, and when they are in thy face they illumine it. (_Here offer  two jugs of wine, one white, one black._)    38. Day hath made an offering unto thee in the sky. The South and the  North have given offerings unto thee. Night hath made an offering unto  thee. The South and the North have made an offering unto thee. An  offering is brought unto thee, look upon it; an offering, hear it. There  is an offering before thee, there is an offering behind thee, there is  an offering with thee. (_Here offer a cake for the journey._)    41. Osiris Unas, the white teeth of Horus are presented unto thee so  that they may fill thy mouth. (_Here offer five bunches of onions._)    47. O Ra, the worship that is paid to thee, the worship of every kind,  shall be paid [also] to Unas. Everything that is offered to thy body  shall be offered to the Double of Unas also, and everything that is  offered to his body shall be thine. (_Here offer the table of holy  offerings._)    61. O ye oils, ye oils, which are on the forehead of Horus, set ye  yourselves on the forehead of Unas, and make him to smell sweet through  you. (_Here offer oil of cedar of the finest quality._)    62. Make ye him to be a spirit-soul (_khu_) through possession of you,  and grant ye him to have the mastery over his body, let his eyes be  opened, and let all the spirit-souls see him, and let them hear his  name. Behold, Osiris Unas, the Eye of Horus hath been brought unto thee,  for it hath been seized for thee that it may be before thee. (_Here  offer the finest Thehenu oil._)      III. As specimens of the hymns in the Pyramid Texts may be quoted the  following: the first is a hymn to Nut, the Sky-goddess, and the second  is a hymn to Ra, the Sun-god.    [O] Nut, thou hast extended thyself over thy son the Osiris Pepi,  Thou hast snatched him out of the hand of Set; join him to thyself, Nut.  Thou comest, snatch thy son; behold, thou comest, form this great      one [like] unto thyself.  [O] Nut, cast thyself upon thy son the Osiris Pepi.  [O] Nut, cast thyself upon thy son the Osiris Pepi.  Form thou him, O Great Fashioner; this great one is among thy children.  Form thou him, O Great Fashioner; this great one is among thy children.  Keb [was to] Nut. Thou didst become a spirit.  Thou wast a mighty goddess in the womb of thy mother Tefnut      when thou wast not born.  Form thou Pepi with life and well-being; he shall not die.  Strong was thy heart,  Thou didst leap in the womb of thy mother in thy name of \"Nut.\"  [O] perfect daughter, mighty one in thy mother, who art crowned      like a king of the North,  Make this Pepi a spirit-soul in thee, let him not die.  [O] Great Lady, who didst come into being in the sky, who art mighty.  Who dost make happy, and dost fill every place (or being), with thy      beauty,  The whole earth is under thee, thou hast taken possession of it.  Thou hast encompassed the earth, everything is in thy two hands,  Grant thou that this Pepi may be in thee like an imperishable star.  Thou hast associated with Keb in thy name of \"Pet\" (_i.e._ Sky).  Thou hast united the earth in every place.  [O] mistress over the earth, thou art above thy father Shu, thou hast      the mastery over him.  He hath loved thee so much that he setteth himself under thee in      everything.  Thou hast taken possession of every god for thyself with his boat (?).  Thou hast made them shine like lamps,  Assuredly they shall not cease from thee like the stars.  Let not this Pepi depart from thee in thy name of \"Hert\" (ll. 61-64).      The Hymn to the Sun-god is as follows:    Hail to thee, Tem! Hail to thee, Kheprer, who created himself.  Thou art the High, in this thy name of \"Height.\"  Thou camest into being in this thy name of \"Kheprer.\"  Hail to thee, Eye of Horus,[1] which he furnisheth with his hands      completely.  He permitteth not thee to be obedient to those of the West;  He permitteth not thee to be obedient to those of the East;  He permitteth not thee to be obedient to those of the South;  He permitteth not thee to be obedient to those of the North;  He permitteth not thee to be obedient to those who are in the earth;  [For] thou art obedient to Horus.  He it is who hath furnished thee, he it is who hath builded thee,      he it is who hath made thee to be dwelt in.  Thou doest for him whatsoever he saith unto thee, in every place      whither he goeth.  Thou liftest up to him the water-fowl that are in thee.  Thou liftest up to him the water-fowl that are about to be in thee.  Thou liftest up to him every tree that is in thee.  Thou liftest up to him every tree that is about to be in thee.  Thou liftest up to him the cakes and ale that are in thee.  Thou liftest up to him the cakes and ale that are about to be in thee.  Thou liftest up to him the gifts that are in thee.  Thou liftest up to him the gifts that are about to be in thee.  Thou liftest up to him everything that is in thee.  Thou liftest up to him everything that is about to be in thee.  Thou takest them to him in every place wherein it pleaseth him to be.  The doors upon thee stand fast [shut] like the god Anmutef,[2]  They open not to those who are in the West;  They open not to those who are in the East;  They open not to those who are in the North;  They open not to those who are in the South;  They open not to those who are in the middle of the earth;  But they open to Horus.    He it was who made them, he it was who made them stand [firm], he it was  who delivered them from every evil attack which the god Set made upon  them. He it was who made thee to be a settled country in this thy name  of \"Kerkut.\" He it was who passed bowing after thee in thy name of  \"Nut.\" He it was who delivered thee from every evil attack which Set  made upon thee (Pepi II, ll. 767-774.)    [Footnote 1: Here a name of Egypt.]    [Footnote 2: The god who was \"the pillar of his mother.\"]      IV.

Sometimes, too, in rainy weather, when the woods seemed wetter  than the lake, and Simmo would be sleeping philosophically, and I  reading, or tying trout flies in the tent, I would hear a gentle stir  and a rustle or two just outside, under the tent fly. Then, if I crept  out quietly, I would find Killooleet exploring my goods to find where  the crackers grew, or just resting contentedly under the fly where it  was dry and comfortable.    It was good to live there among them, with the mountain at our backs  and the lake at our feet, and peace breathing in every breeze or  brooding silently over the place at twilight. Rain or shine, day or  night, these white-throated sparrows are the sunniest, cheeriest folk  to be found anywhere in the woods. I grew to understand and love the  Milicete name, Killooleet, Little Sweet-Voice, for its expressiveness.  \"Hour-Bird\" the Micmacs call him; for they say he sings every hour,  and so tells the time, \"all same's one white man's watch.\" And indeed  there is rarely an hour, day or night, in the northern woods when you  cannot hear Killooleet singing. Other birds grow silent after they  have won their mates, or they grow fat and lazy as summer advances, or  absorbed in the care of their young, and have no time nor thought for  singing. But not so Killooleet. He is kinder to his mate after he has  won her, and never lets selfishness or the summer steal away his  music; for he knows that the woods are brighter for his singing.    Sometimes, at night, I would, take a brand from the fire, and follow a  deer path that wound about the mountain, or steal away into a dark  thicket and strike a parlor match. As the flame shot up, lighting its  little circle of waiting leaves, there would be a stir beside me in  the underbrush, or overhead in the fir; then tinkling out of the  darkness, like a brook under the snow, would come the low clear strain  of melody that always set my heart a-dancing,--_I'm here, sweet  Killooleet-lillooleet-lillooleet_, the good-night song of my gentle  neighbor. Then along the path a little way, and another match, and  another song to make one better and his rest sweeter.    By day I used to listen to them, hours long at a stretch, practicing  to perfect their song. These were the younger birds, of course; and  for a long time they puzzled me. Those who know Killooleet's song will  remember that it begins with three clear sweet notes; but very few  have observed the break between the second and third of these. I  noticed, first of all, that certain birds would start the song twenty  times in succession, yet never get beyond the second note. And when I  crept up, to find out about it, I would find them sitting  disconsolately, deep in shadow, instead of out in the light where they  love to sing, with a pitiful little droop of wings and tail, and the  air of failure and dejection in every movement. Then again these same  singers would touch the third note, and always in such cases they  would prolong the last trill, the _lillooleet-lillooleet_ (the  _Peabody-Peabody_, as some think of it), to an indefinite length,  instead of stopping at the second or third repetition, which is the  rule with good singers. Then they would come out of the shadow, and  stir about briskly, and sing again with an air of triumph.    One day, while lying still in the underbrush watching a wood mouse,  Killooleet, a fine male bird and a perfect singer, came and sang on a  branch just over my head, not noticing me. Then I discovered that  there is a trill, a tiny grace note or yodel, at the end of his second  note. I listened carefully to other singers, as close as I could get,  and found that it is always there, and is the one difficult part of  the song. You must be very close to the bird to appreciate the beauty  of this little yodel; for ten feet away it sounds like a faint cluck  interrupting the flow of the third note; and a little farther away you  cannot hear it at all.    [Illustration: Killooleet]    Whatever its object, Killooleet regards this as the indispensable part  of his song, and never goes on to the third note unless he gets the  second perfectly. That accounts for the many times when one hears only  the first two notes. That accounts also for the occasional prolonged  trill which one hears; for when a young bird has tried many times for  his grace note without success, and then gets it unexpectedly, he is  so pleased with himself that he forgets he is not Whippoorwill, who  tries to sing as long as the brook without stopping, and so keeps up  the final _lillooleet-lillooleet_ as long as he has an atom of breath  left to do it with.    But of all the Killooleets,--and there were many that I soon  recognized, either by their songs, or by some peculiarity in their  striped caps or brown jackets,--the most interesting was the one who  first perched on my ridgepole and bade me welcome to his camping  ground. I soon learned to distinguish him easily; his cap was very  bright, and his white cravat very full, and his song never stopped at  the second note, for he had mastered the trill perfectly. Then, too,  he was more friendly and fearless than all the others. The morning  after our arrival (it was better weather, as Simmo and Killooleet had  predicted) we were eating breakfast by the fire, when he lit on the  ground close by, and turned his head sidewise to look at us curiously.  I tossed him a big crumb, which made him run away in fright; but when  he thought we were not looking he stole back, touched, tasted, ate the  whole of it. And when I threw him another crumb, he hopped to meet it.    After that he came regularly to meals, and would look critically over  the tin plate which I placed at my feet, and pick and choose daintily  from the cracker and trout and bacon and porridge which I offered him.  Soon he began to take bits away with him, and I could hear him, just  inside the fringe of underbrush, persuading his mate to come too and  share his plate. But she was much shyer than he; it was several days  before I noticed her flitting in and out of the shadowy underbrush;  and when I tossed her the first crumb, she flew away in a terrible  fright. Gradually, however, Killooleet persuaded her that we were  kindly, and she came often to meals; but she would never come near, to  eat from my tin plate, till after I had gone away.    Never a day now passed that one or both of the birds did not rest on  my tent. When I put my head out, like a turtle out of his shell, in  the early morning to look at the weather, Killooleet would look down  from the projecting end of the ridgepole and sing good-morning. And  when I had been out late on the lake, night-fishing, or following the  inlet for beaver, or watching the grassy points for caribou, or just  drifting along shore silently to catch the night sounds and smells of  the woods, I would listen with childish anticipation for Killooleet's  welcome as I approached the landing. He had learned to recognize the  sounds of my coming, the rub of a careless paddle, the ripple of  water under the bow, or the grating of pebbles on the beach; and with  Simmo asleep, and the fire low, it was good to be welcomed back by a  cheery little voice in the darkness; for he always sang when he heard  me. Sometimes I would try to surprise him; but his sleep was too light  and his ears too keen. The canoe would glide up to the old cedar and  touch the shore noiselessly; but with the first crunch of gravel under  my foot, or the rub of my canoe as I lifted it out, he would waken;  and his song, all sweetness and cheer, _I'm here, sweet  Killooleet-lillooleet-lillooleet_, would ripple out of the dark  underbrush where his nest was.    I am glad now to think that I never saw that nest, though it was  scarcely ten yards from my tent, until after the young had flown, and  Killooleet cared no more about it. I knew the bush in which it was,  close by the deer path; could pick out from my fireplace the thick  branch that sheltered it; for I often watched the birds coming and  going. I have no doubt that Killooleet would have welcomed me there  without fear; but his mate never laid aside her shyness about it,  never went to it directly when I was looking, and I knew he would like  me better if I respected her little secret.    Soon, from the mate's infrequent visits, and from the amount of food  which Killooleet took away with him, I knew she was brooding her eggs.  And when at last both birds came together, and, instead of helping  themselves hungrily, each took the largest morsel he could carry and  hurried away to the nest, I knew that the little ones were come; and I  spread the plate more liberally, and moved it away to the foot of the  old cedar, where Killooleet's mate would not be afraid to come at any  time.    One day, not long after, as I sat at a late breakfast after the  morning's fishing, there was a great stir in the underbrush. Presently  Killooleet came skipping out, all fuss and feathers, running back and  forth with an air of immense importance between the last bush and the  plate by the cedar, crying out in his own way, \"Here it is, here it  is, all right, just by the old tree as usual. Crackers, trout, brown  bread, porridge; come on, come on; don't be afraid. _He's_ here, but  he won't harm. I know him. Come on, come on!\"    Soon his little gray mate appeared under the last bush, and after much  circumspection came hopping towards the breakfast; and after her, in a  long line, five little Killooleets, hopping, fluttering, cheeping,  stumbling,--all in a fright at the big world, but all in a desperate  hurry for crackers and porridge _ad libitum_; now casting hungry eyes  at the plate under the old cedar, now stopping to turn their heads  sidewise to see the big kind animal with only two legs, that  Killooleet had told them about, no doubt, many times.    After that we had often"]]]
