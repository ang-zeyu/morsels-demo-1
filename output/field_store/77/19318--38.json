I met with many enemies, and much persecution, among the sailors; one of  them was particularly unkind to me, and studied ways to vex and teaze  me.--I can't help mentioning one circumstance that hurt me more than all  the rest, which was, that he snatched a book out of my hand that I was  very fond of, and used frequently to amuse myself with, and threw it  into the sea.--But what is remarkable he was the first that was killed  in our engagement.--I don't pretend to say that this happen'd because he  was not my friend: but I thought 'twas a very awful Providence to see  how the enemies of the LORD are cut off.    Our Captain was a cruel hard-hearted man. I was excessively sorry for  the prisoners we took in general; but the pitiable case of one young  Gentleman grieved me to the heart.--He appear'd very amiable; was  strikingly handsome. Our Captain took four thousand pounds from him; but  that did not satisfy him, as he imagin'd he was possess'd of more, and  had somewhere conceal'd it, so that the Captain threatened him with  death, at which he appear'd in the deepest distress, and took the  buckles out of his shoes, and untied his hair, which was very fine, and  long; and in which several very valuable rings were fasten'd. He came  into the Cabbin to me, and in the most obliging terms imaginable ask'd  for something to eat and drink; which when I gave him, he was so  thankful and pretty in his manner that my heart bled for him; and I  heartily wish'd that I could have spoken in any language in which the  ship's crew would not have understood me; that I might have let him know  his danger; for I heard the Captain say he was resolv'd upon his death;  and he put his barbarous design into execution, for he took him on shore  with one of the sailors, and there they shot him.    This circumstance affected me exceedingly, I could not put him out of my  mind a long while.--When we return'd to New-York the Captain divided the  prize-money among us, that we had taken. When I was call'd upon to  receive my part, I waited upon Mr. ----, (the Gentleman that paid my debt  and was the occasion of my going abroad) to know if he chose to go with  me to receive my money or if I should bring him what I owed.--He chose  to go with me; and when the Captain laid my money on the table ('twas an  hundred and thirty-five pounds) I desir'd Mr. ---- to take what I was  indebted to him; and he swept it all into his handkerchief, and would  never be prevail'd on to give a farthing of money, nor any thing at all  beside.--And he likewise secur'd a hogshead of sugar which was my due  from the same ship. The Captain was very angry with him for this piece  of cruelty to me, as was every other person that heard it.--But I have  reason to believe (as he was one of the Principal Merchants in the city)  that he transacted business for him and on that account did not chuse to  quarrel with him.    At this time a very worthy Gentleman, a Wine Merchant, his name Dunscum,  took me under his protection, and would have recovered my money for me  if I had chose it; but I told him to let it alone; that I wou'd rather  be quiet.--I believed that it would not prosper with him, and so it  happen'd, for by a series of losses and misfortunes he became poor, and  was soon after drowned, as he was on a party of pleasure.--The vessel  was driven out to sea, and struck against a rock by which means every  soul perished.    I was very much distress'd when I heard it, and felt greatly for his  family who were reduc'd to very low circumstances.--I never knew how to  set a proper value on money. If I had but a little meat and drink to  supply the present necessaries of life, I never wish'd for more; and  when I had any I always gave it if ever I saw an object in distress. If  it was not for my dear Wife and Children I should pay as little regard  to money now as I did at that time.--I continu'd some time with Mr.  Dunscum as his servant; he was very kind to me.--But I had a vast  inclination to visit England, and wish'd continually that it would  please Providence to make a clear way for me to see this Island. I  entertain'd a notion that if I could get to England I should never more  experience either cruelty or ingratitude, so that I was very desirous to  get among Christians. I knew Mr. Whitefield very well.--I had heard him  preach often at New-York. In this disposition I listed in the  twenty-eighth Regiment of Foot, who were design'd for Martinico in the  late war.--We went in Admiral Pocock's fleet from New-York to Barbadoes;  from thence to Martinico.--When that was taken we proceeded to the  Havannah, and took that place likewise.--There I got discharged.    I was then worth about thirty pounds, but I never regarded money in the  least, nor would I tarry to receive my prize-money least I should lose  my chance of going to England.--I went with the Spanish prisoners to  Spain; and came to Old-England with the English prisoners.--I cannot  describe my joy when we were within sight of Portsmouth. But I was  astonished when we landed to hear the inhabitants of that place curse  and swear, and otherwise profane. I expected to find nothing but  goodness, gentleness and meekness in this Christian Land, I then  suffer'd great perplexities of mind.    I enquir'd if any serious Christian people resided there, the woman I  made this enquiry of, answer'd me in the affirmative; and added that she  was one of them.--I was heartily glad to hear her say so. I thought I  could give her my whole heart: she kept a Public-House. I deposited with  her all the money that I had not an immediate occasion for; as I thought  it would be safer with her.--It was 25 guineas but 6 of them I desired  her to lay out to the best advantage, to buy me some shirts, hat and  some other necessaries. I made her a present of a very handsome large  looking glass that I brought with me from Martinico, in order to  recompence her for the trouble I had given her. I must do this woman the  justice to acknowledge that she did lay out some little for my use, but  the 19 guineas and part of the 6, with my watch, she would not return,  but denied that I ever gave it her.    I soon perceived that I was got among bad people, who defrauded me of my  money and watch; and that all my promis'd happiness was blasted, I had  no friend but GOD and I pray'd to Him earnestly. I could scarcely  believe it possible that the place where so many eminent Christians had  lived and preached could abound with so much wickedness and deceit. I  thought it worse than _Sodom_ (considering the great advantages they  have) I cryed like a child and that almost continually: at length GOD  heard my prayers and rais'd me a friend indeed.    This publican had a brother who lived on Portsmouth-common, his wife was  a very serious good woman.--When she heard of the treatment I had met  with, she came and enquired into my real situation and was greatly  troubled at the ill usage I had received, and took me home to her own  house.--I began now to rejoice, and my prayer was turned into praise.  She made use of all the arguments in her power to prevail on her who had  wronged me, to return my watch and money, but it was to no purpose, as  she had given me no receipt and I had nothing to show for it, I could  not demand it.--My good friend was excessively angry with her and  obliged her to give me back four guineas, which she said she gave me out  of charity: Though in fact it was my own, and much more. She would have  employed some rougher means to oblige her to give up my money, but I  would not suffer her, let it go says I \"My GOD is in heaven.\" Still I  did not mind my loss in the least; all that grieved me was, that I had  been disappointed in finding some Christian friends, with whom I hoped  to enjoy a little sweet and comfortable society.    I thought the best method that I could take now, was to go to London,  and find out Mr. Whitefield, who was the only living soul I knew in  England, and get him to direct me to some way or other to procure a  living without being troublesome to any Person.--I took leave of my  Christian friend at Portsmouth, and went in the stage to London.--A  creditable tradesman in the City, who went up with me in the stage,  offer'd to show me the way to Mr. Whitefield's Tabernacle. Knowing that  I was a perfect stranger, I thought it very kind, and accepted his  offer; but he obliged me to give him half-a-crown for going with me, and  likewise insisted on my giving him five shillings more for conducting me  to Dr. Gifford's Meeting.

The first part of the external view of all  states, their relation as friends, makes so trifling a figure in  history, that I am very sorry to say, it affords me but little matter on  which to expatiate. The good offices done by one nation to its  neighbor;[8] the support given in public distress; the relief afforded  in general calamity; the protection granted in emergent danger; the  mutual return of kindness and civility, would afford a very ample and  very pleasing subject for history. But, alas! all the history of all  times, concerning all nations, does not afford matter enough to fill ten  pages, though it should be spun out by the wire-drawing amplification of  a Guicciardini himself. The glaring side is that of enmity. War is the  matter which fills all history, and consequently the only or almost the  only view in which we can see the external of political society is in a  hostile shape; and the only actions to which we have always seen, and  still see all of them intent, are such as tend to the destruction of one  another. \"War,\" says Machiavel, \"ought to be the only study of a  prince\"; and by a prince, he means every sort of state, however  constituted. \"He ought,\" says this great political doctor, \"to consider  peace only as a breathing-time, which gives him leisure to contrive, and  furnishes ability to execute military plans.\" A meditation on the  conduct of political societies made old Hobbes imagine, that war was the  state of nature; and truly, if a man judged of the individuals of our  race by their conduct when united and packed into nations and kingdoms,  he might imagine that every sort of virtue was unnatural and foreign to  the mind of man.    The first accounts we have of mankind are but so many accounts of their  butcheries. All empires have been cemented in blood; and, in those early  periods, when the race of mankind began first to form themselves into  parties and combinations, the first effect of the combination, and  indeed the end for which it seems purposely formed, and best calculated,  was their mutual destruction. All ancient history is dark and  uncertain. One thing, however, is clear,--there were conquerors, and  conquests in those days; and, consequently, all that devastation by  which they are formed, and all that oppression by which they are  maintained. We know little of Sesostris, but that he led out of Egypt an  army of above 700,000 men; that he overran the Mediterranean coast as  far as Colchis; that in some places he met but little resistance, and of  course shed not a great deal of blood; but that he found in others a  people who knew the value of their liberties, and sold them dear.  Whoever considers the army this conqueror headed, the space he  traversed, and the opposition he frequently met, with the natural  accidents of sickness, and the dearth and badness of provision to which  he must have been subject in the variety of climates and countries his  march lay through, if he knows anything, he must know that even the  conqueror's army must have suffered greatly; and that of this immense  number but a very small part could have returned to enjoy the plunder  accumulated by the loss of so many of their companions, and the  devastation of so considerable a part of the world. Considering, I say,  the vast army headed by this conqueror, whose unwieldy weight was almost  alone sufficient to wear down its strength, it will be far from excess  to suppose that one half was lost in the expedition. If this was the  state of the victorious, and from the circumstances it must have been  this at the least; the vanquished must have had a much heavier loss, as  the greatest slaughter is always in the flight, and great carnage did in  those times and countries ever attend the first rage of conquest. It  will, therefore, be very reasonable to allow on their account as much  as, added to the losses of the conqueror, may amount to a million of  deaths, and then we shall see this conqueror, the oldest we have on the  records of history, (though, as we have observed before, the chronology  of these remote times is extremely uncertain), opening the scene by a  destruction of at least one million of his species, unprovoked but by  his ambition, without any motives but pride, cruelty, and madness, and  without any benefit to himself (for Justin expressly tells us he did not  maintain his conquests), but solely to make so many people, in so  distant countries, feel experimentally how severe a scourge Providence  intends for the human race, when he gives one man the power over many,  and arms his naturally impotent and feeble rage with the hands of  millions, who know no common principle of action, but a blind obedience  to the passions of their ruler.    The next personage who figures in the tragedies of this ancient theatre  is Semiramis; for we have no particulars of Ninus, but that he made  immense and rapid conquests, which doubtless were not compassed without  the usual carnage. We see an army of about three millions employed by  this martial queen in a war against the Indians. We see the Indians  arming a yet greater; and we behold a war continued with much fury, and  with various success. This ends in the retreat of the queen, with scarce  a third of the troops employed in the expedition; an expedition which,  at this rate, must have cost two millions of souls on her part; and it  is not unreasonable to judge that the country which was the seat of war  must have been an equal sufferer. But I am content to detract from this,  and to suppose that the Indians lost only half so much, and then the  account stands thus: in this war alone (for Semiramis had other wars) in  this single reign, and in this one spot of the globe, did three millions  of souls expire, with all the horrid and shocking circumstances which  attend all wars, and in a quarrel, in which none of the sufferers could  have the least rational concern.    The Babylonian, Assyrian, Median, and Persian monarchies must have  poured out seas of blood in their formation, and in their destruction.  The armies and fleets of Xerxes, their numbers, the glorious stand made  against them, and the unfortunate event of all his mighty preparations,  are known to everybody. In this expedition, draining half Asia of its  inhabitants, he led an army of about two millions to be slaughtered, and  wasted by a thousand fatal accidents, in the same place where his  predecessors had before by a similar madness consumed the flower of so  many kingdoms, and wasted the force of so extensive an empire. It is a  cheap calculation to say, that the Persian empire, in its wars against  the Greeks and Scythians, threw away at least four millions of its  subjects; to say nothing of its other wars, and the losses sustained in  them. These were their losses abroad; but the war was brought home to  them, first by Agesilaus, and afterwards by Alexander. I have not, in  this retreat, the books necessary to make very exact calculations; nor  is it necessary to give more than hints to one of your lordship's  erudition. You will recollect his uninterrupted series of success. You  will run over his battles. You will call to mind the carnage which was  made. You will give a glance at the whole, and you will agree with me,  that to form this hero no less than twelve hundred thousand lives must  have been sacrificed; but no sooner had he fallen himself a sacrifice to  his vices, than a thousand breaches were made for ruin to enter, and  give the last hand to this scene of misery and destruction. His kingdom  was rent and divided; which served to employ the more distinct parts to  tear each other to pieces, and bury the whole in blood and slaughter.  The kings of Syria and of Egypt, the kings of Pergamus and Macedon,  without intermission worried each other for above two hundred years;  until at last a strong power, arising in the west, rushed in upon them  and silenced their tumults, by involving all the contending parties in  the same destruction. It is little to say, that the contentions between  the successors of Alexander depopulated that part of the world of at  least two millions.    The struggle between the Macedonians and Greeks, and, before that, the  disputes of the Greek commonwealths among themselves, for an  unprofitable superiority, form one of the bloodiest scenes in history.  One is astonished how such a small spot could furnish men sufficient to  sacrifice to the pitiful ambition of possessing five or six thousand  more acres, or two or three more villages; yet to see the acrimony and  bitterness with which this was disputed between the Athenians and  Lacedemonians; what armies cut off; what fleets sunk and burnt; what a  number of cities sacked, and their inhabitants slaughtered and captived;  one would be induced to believe the decision of the fate of mankind, at  least, depended upon it! But those disputes ended as all such ever have  done, and ever will do; in a real weakness of all parties; a momentary  shadow, and dream of power in some one; and the subjection of all to the  yoke of a stranger, who knows how to profit of their divisions. This,  at least, was the case of the Greeks; and surely, from the earliest  accounts of them, to their absorption into the Roman empire, we cannot  judge that their intestine divisions, and their foreign wars, consumed  less than three millions of their inhabitants.    What an Aceldama, what a field of blood Sicily has been in ancient  times, whilst the mode of its government was controverted between the  republican and tyrannical parties, and the possession struggled for by  the natives, the Greeks, the Carthaginians, and the Romans, your  lordship will easily recollect. You will remember the total destruction  of such bodies as an army of 300,000 men. You will find every page of  its history dyed in blood, and blotted and confounded by tumults,  rebellions, massacres,"]]]
