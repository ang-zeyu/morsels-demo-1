Perception is  pent up and becomes, helped by emotion, conscious _representation_. Now  it is, psychologists tell us, just in this interval, this space between  perception and reaction, this momentary halt, that all our mental life,  our images, our ideas, our consciousness, and assuredly our religion and  our art, is built up. If the cycle of knowing, feeling, acting, were  instantly fulfilled, that is, if we were a mass of well-contrived  instincts, we should hardly have _dromena_, and we should certainly  never pass from _dromena_ to _drama_. Art and religion, though perhaps  not wholly ritual, spring from the incomplete cycle, from unsatisfied  desire, from perception and emotion that have somehow not found  immediate outlet in practical action. When we come later to establish  the dividing line between art and ritual we shall find this fact to be  cardinal.    We have next to watch how out of _representation repeated_ there grows  up a kind of _abstraction_ which helps the transition from ritual to  art. When the men of a tribe return from a hunt, a journey, a battle, or  any event that has caused them keen and pleasant emotion, they will  often re-act their doings round the camp-fire at night to an attentive  audience of women and young boys. The cause of this world-wide custom is  no doubt in great part the desire to repeat a pleasant experience; the  battle or the hunt will not be re-enacted unless it has been successful.  Together with this must be reckoned a motive seldom absent from human  endeavour, the desire for self-exhibition, self-enhancement. But in this  re-enactment, we see at once, lies the germ of history and of  commemorative ceremonial, and also, oddly enough, an impulse emotional  in itself begets a process we think of as characteristically and  exclusively intellectual, the process of abstraction. The savage begins  with the particular battle that actually _did_ happen; but, it is easy  to see that if he re-enacts it again and again the _particular_ battle  or hunt will be forgotten, the representation cuts itself loose from  the particular action from which it arose, and becomes generalized, as  it were abstracted. Like children he plays not at a funeral, but at  \"funerals,\" not at a battle, but at battles; and so arises the  war-dance, or the death-dance, or the hunt-dance. This will serve to  show how inextricably the elements of knowing and feeling are  intertwined.    So, too, with the element of action. If we consider the occasions when a  savage dances, it will soon appear that it is not only after a battle or  a hunt that he dances in order to commemorate it, but before. Once the  commemorative dance has got abstracted or generalized it becomes  material for the magical dance, the dance pre-done. A tribe about to go  to war will work itself up by a war dance; about to start out hunting  they will catch their game in pantomime. Here clearly the main emphasis  is on the practical, the active, doing-element in the cycle. The dance  is, as it were, a sort of precipitated desire, a discharge of pent-up  emotion into action.    In both these kinds of dances, the dance that commemorates by  _re_-presenting and the dance that anticipates by _pre_-presenting,  Plato would have seen the element of imitation, what the Greeks called  _mimesis_, which we saw he believed to be the very source and essence of  all art. In a sense he would have been right. The commemorative dance  does especially _re_-present; it reproduces the past hunt or battle; but  if we analyse a little more closely we see it is not for the sake of  copying the actual battle itself, but for the _emotion felt about the  battle_. This they desire to re-live. The emotional element is seen  still more clearly in the dance _fore_-done for magical purposes.  Success in war or in the hunt is keenly, intensely desired. The hunt or  the battle cannot take place at the moment, so the cycle cannot complete  itself. The desire cannot find utterance in the actual act; it grows and  accumulates by inhibition, till at last the exasperated nerves and  muscles can bear it no longer; it breaks out into mimetic anticipatory  action. But, and this is the important point, the action is mimetic, not  of what you see done by another; but of what you desire to do yourself.  The habit of this _mimesis_ of the thing desired, is set up, and ritual  begins. Ritual, then, does imitate, but for an emotional, not an  altogether practical, end.    Plato never saw a savage war-dance or a hunt-dance or a rain-dance, and  it is not likely that, if he had seen one, he would have allowed it to  be art at all. But he must often have seen a class of performances very  similar, to which unquestionably he would give the name of art. He must  have seen plays like those of Aristophanes, with the chorus dressed up  as Birds or Clouds or Frogs or Wasps, and he might undoubtedly have  claimed such plays as evidence of the rightness of his definition. Here  were men _imitating_ birds and beasts, dressed in their skins and  feathers, mimicking their gestures. For his own days his judgment would  have been unquestionably right; but again, if we look at the beginning  of things, we find an origin and an impulse much deeper, vaguer, and  more emotional.    The beast dances found widespread over the savage world took their rise  when men really believed, what St. Francis tried to preach: that beasts  and birds and fishes were his \"little brothers.\" Or rather, perhaps,  more strictly, he felt them to be his great brothers and his fathers,  for the attitude of the Australian towards the kangaroo, the North  American towards the grizzly bear, is one of affection tempered by deep  religious awe. The beast dances look back to that early phase of  civilization which survives in crystallized form in what we call  _totemism_. \"Totem\" means tribe, but the tribe was of animals as well as  men. In the Kangaroo tribe there were real leaping kangaroos as well as  men-kangaroos. The men-kangaroos when they danced and leapt did it, not  to _imitate_ kangaroos--you cannot imitate yourself--but just for  natural joy of heart because they _were_ kangaroos; they belonged to the  Kangaroo tribe, they bore the tribal marks and delighted to assert their  tribal unity. What they felt was not _mimesis_ but \"participation,\"  unity, and community. Later, when man begins to distinguish between  himself and his strange fellow-tribesmen, to realize that he is _not_ a  kangaroo like other kangaroos, he will try to revive his old faith, his  old sense of participation and oneness, by conscious imitation. Thus  though imitation is not the object of these dances, it grows up in and  through them. It is the same with art. The origin of art is not  _mimesis_, but _mimesis_ springs up out of art, out of emotional  expression, and constantly and closely neighbours it. Art and ritual  are at the outset alike in this, that they do not seek to copy a fact,  but to reproduce, to re-enact an emotion.           *       *       *       *       *    We shall see this more clearly if we examine for a moment this Greek  word _mimesis_. We translate m{-i}m{-e}sis by \"imitation,\" and we do very  wrongly. The word _mimesis_ means the action or doing of a person called  a _mime_. Now a _mime_ was simply a person who dressed up and acted in a  pantomime or primitive drama. He was roughly what we should call an  _actor_, and it is significant that in the word _actor_ we stress not  imitating but acting, doing, just what the Greek stressed in his words  _dromenon_ and _drama_. The actor dresses up, puts on a mask, wears the  skin of a beast or the feathers of a bird, not, as we have seen, to copy  something or some one who is not himself, but to emphasize, enlarge,  enhance, his own personality; he masquerades, he does not mimic.    The celebrants in the very primitive ritual of the Mountain-Mother in  Thrace were, we know, called _mimes_. In the fragment of his lost play,  AEschylus, after describing the din made by the \"mountain gear\" of the  Mother, the maddening hum of the _bombykes_, a sort of spinning-top,  the clash of the brazen cymbals and the twang of the strings, thus goes  on:         \"And bull-voices roar thereto from somewhere out of the unseen,       fearful _mimes_, and from a drum an image, as it were, of thunder       underground is borne on the air heavy with dread.\"    Here we have undoubtedly some sort of \"bull-roaring,\" thunder-and  wind-making ceremony, like those that go on in Australia to-day. The  _mimes_ are not mimicking thunder out of curiosity, they are making it  and enacting and uttering it for magical purposes. When a sailor wants a  wind he makes it, or, as he later says, he whistles _for_ it; when a  savage or a Greek wants thunder to bring rain he makes it, becomes it.  But it is easy to see that as the belief in magic declines, what was  once intense desire, issuing in the making of or the being of a thing,  becomes mere copying of it; the mime, the maker, sinks to be in our  modern sense the mimic; as faith declines, folly and futility set in;  the earnest, zealous _act_ sinks into a frivolous mimicry, a sort of  child's-play.

CHAPTER III    SEASONAL RITES: THE SPRING FESTIVAL      We have seen in the last chapter that whatever interests primitive man,  whatever makes him feel strongly, he tends to re-enact.

During the year 1542-3, Roberval saw fifty persons dying of the  disease at Charlesbourg Royal. At Ste. Croix the proportion of deaths  was still greater, thirty-five out of seventy-nine. There was a  physician attached to de Monts' party, but he did not understand the  disease, and therefore could not satisfactorily prescribe for it. De  Monts also consulted many physicians in Paris, but he did not receive  answers that were of much service to him.    At the commencement of the seventeenth century scientific men  distinguished scurvy on land from scurvy on sea. They laboured under the  false impression that the one differed from the other. Champlain called  the disease _mal de terre_. It is certain, however, that the symptoms  did not vary in either case, as we may ascertain from the descriptions  furnished by Jacques Cartier and Champlain.    The position of the settlement was soon proved to be untenable, and de  Monts was certainly to blame for this unhappy state of affairs. Why did  he abandon Port Royal, where he had found abundant water? Champlain,  however, defends the action of his chief.    \"It would be very difficult,\" he says, \"to ascertain the character of  this region without spending a winter in it, for, on arriving here in  summer, everything is very agreeable in consequence of the woods, fine  country, and the many varieties of good fish which are found.\" We must  not forget, however, that the climate of this island differed very  little from that of Tadousac, which had greatly disappointed de Monts,  and that his sole object in settling in a more southern latitude was to  avoid the disagreeable consequences of the climate.    Champlain made a plan of the island of Ste. Croix, indicating the  buildings constructed for the habitation of the settlers. We observe  many isolated tenements forming a large square. On one side was the  residence of Champlain, of Champdore and d'Orville, with a large garden  opposite. Near d'Orville's residence was a small building set apart for  the missionaries. On the other side may be seen the storehouse, de  Monts' dwelling, a public hall where the people spent their leisure, and  a building for Boulay and the workmen. In an angle of the large square  were the residences of Genestou, Sourin, de Beaumont, La Motte, Bourioli  and Fougeray. A small fort is shown at one end of the island, approached  by a pathway. The chapel of the priest Aubry was located near the cannon  of the fort. Such was the plan of the first Acadian settlement. Much  expense had been incurred for a very poor result.    De Monts was the directing spirit of the colony, and in spite of his  noble attempts, he realized that his efforts were fruitless and that he  would have to try another place for a permanent settlement. By the  direction of his chief, Champlain accordingly undertook to explore the  seacoast of Norembega.    De Monts has found a defender in Moreau, who held that Ste. Croix was  only intended for winter quarters. If this had been his intention, we  can scarcely believe that he would have incurred so great an expense in  building a number of houses. Lescarbot, whose testimony is most  valuable, says: \"When we go into a country to take possession of land we  don't stop on islands to imprison ourselves. If that island had been  supplied with rivers or streams, if the soil had been favourable to  agriculture, it would have been half wrong.\" But this island lacked the  very first element essential to life, fresh water.    Towards the middle of May, 1605, every one's attention was directed  towards France, as the ships which had been expected for over a month  had not yet arrived. De Monts then determined to send his party to Gaspe  in two large boats to join Pont-Grave. At this juncture, however,  Pont-Grave arrived at Ste. Croix with his crew, comprising forty men.    De Monts and Pont-Grave held a consultation and decided to seek a more  suitable place for a settlement, rather than to return to France. De  Monts was still under the impression that the best plan was to attempt  to settle in the vicinity of Florida, although the result of Champlain's  exploration along the coast of the Norembega[5] was considered  unsatisfactory.    Let us now examine what Champlain had accomplished during the month of  September, 1604.    He left Ste. Croix on September 5th, in a _patache_, with twelve sailors  and two savages as guides. On the first day he covered twenty-five  leagues and discovered many islands, reefs and rocks. To another island,  four or five leagues in length, he gave the name of Ile des Monts  Deserts[6], which name has been preserved. On the following day  Champlain met some hunting Indians of the Etchemin tribe, proceeding  from the Pentagouet River to the Mount Desert Islands. \"I think this  river,\" says Champlain, \"is that which several pilots and historians  call Norembegue, and which most have described as large and extensive,  with very many islands, its mouth being in latitude 43 deg., 43', 30''....  It is related also that there is a large, thickly-settled town of  savages, who are adroit and skilful, and who have cotton yards. I am  confident that most of those who mention it have not seen it, and speak  of it because they have heard persons say so, who know no more about it  than they themselves.... But that any one has ever entered it there is  no evidence, for then they would have described it in another manner, in  order to relieve the minds of many of this doubt.\"    Champlain's description is written from personal knowledge, because he  had seen the Pentagouet River.[7] The country which it passes through is  agreeable, but there was no town or village, and no appearance of  either, with the exception of a few deserted cabins of the Souriquois or  Micmacs.    Here Champlain met two Souriquois chiefs, Bessabe and Cabahis, and  succeeded in making them understand that he had been sent by de Monts to  visit their country, and to assure them of the friendship of the French  for the Souriquois. Champlain continued his journey southwards, and two  days later he again met Cabahis, of whom he asked particulars as to the  course of the river Norembegue. The chief replied \"that they had already  passed the fall, which is situated at about twenty leagues from the  mouth of the river Penobscot. Here it widens into a lake, by way of  which the Indians pass to the river Ste. Croix, by going some distance  overland and then entering the river Etchemin. Another river also enters  the lake, along which they proceed for some days until they gain another  lake and pass through it. Reaching the end of it they again make a land  journey of some distance until they reach another small river, the mouth  of which is within a league of Quebec.\" This little river is the  Chaudiere, which the Indians follow to reach Quebec. On September 20th  Champlain observed the mountains of Bedabedec, and after having  proceeded for ten or twelve leagues further he decided to return to Ste.  Croix and wait until the following year to continue his explorations.  His opinion was that the region he had explored was quite as  unfavourable for a settlement as Ste. Croix.    On June 18th, 1605, de Monts, at the head of an expedition consisting of  Champlain, some gentlemen, twelve sailors and an Indian guide named  Panonias and his wife, set out from the island of Ste. Croix to explore  the country of the Armouchiquois, and reached the Pentagouet River in  twelve days. On July 20th they made about twenty leagues between  Bedabedec Point and the Kennebec River, at the mouth of which is an  island which they named _La Tortue_.    Continuing their journey towards the south they observed some large  mountains, the abode of an Indian chief named Aneda. \"I was satisfied  from the name,\" says Champlain, \"that he was one of his tribe that had  discovered the plant called _aneda_, which Jacques Cartier said was so  powerful against the malady called scurvy, which harassed his company as  well as our own when they wintered in Canada. The savages have no  knowledge at all of this plant, and are not aware of its existence,  although the above mentioned savage has the same name.\" This supposition  was unfounded, because if this Indian had been of the same origin as the  aborigines who acquainted Jacques Cartier with the virtue of the  _aneda_ plant in cases of scurvy, he would have understood the meaning  of the word. _Aneda_ is the Iroquois word for the spruce tree, but there  is no evidence to prove that Champlain was ever aware that it was a  specific. Had he known of its efficacy he would have certainly employed  it.    At Chouacouet de Monts and Champlain received visits from many Indians,  differing entirely from either the Etchemins or the Armouchiquois. They  found the soil tilled and cultivated, and the corn in the gardens was  about two feet in height. Beans, pumpkins and squash were also in  flower. The place was very pleasant and agreeable at the time, but  Champlain believed the weather was very severe in the winter.    The party proceeded still further south, in sight of the Cap aux Iles  (Cape Porpoise), and on July 17th, 1605, they came to anchor at Cape St.  Louis,[8] where an Indian chief named Honabetha paid them a visit. To a  small river which they found in the vicinity they gave the name of Gua,  in honour of de Monts. The expedition passed the night of the 18th in a  small bay called Cape St. Louis. On the 19th they observed the cape of a  large bay, which they distinguished by the title of Ste. Suzanne du Cap  Blanc, and on July 20th they entered a spacious harbour, which proved  to be very dangerous on account of shoals and banks; they therefore  named it Mallebarre.    Five weeks had now elapsed since the expedition had left Ste. Croix, and  no incident of importance had occurred. They had met many tribes of  Indians, and on each"]]]
