I will quote his own  words, which already foreshadowed the contemptuous reception given by  \"advanced\" politicians to the reforms embodied in last year's Indian  Councils Act:--       You may get a High Court judgeship here, membership     of the Legislative Council there, possibly an Executive     Membership of the Council. Or do you want an expansion     of the Legislative Councils? Do you want that a few Indians     shall sit as your representatives in the House of Commons?     Do you want a large number of Indians in the Civil Service?     Let us see whether 50, 100, 200, or 300 civilians will make     the Government our own.... The whole Civil Service     might be Indian, but the Civil servants have to carry out     orders--they cannot direct, they cannot dictate the policy.     One swallow does not make the summer. One civilian,     100 or 1,000 civilians in the service of the British Government     will not make that Government Indian. There are traditions,     there are laws, there are policies to which every civilian, be     he black or brown or white, must submit, and as long as     these traditions have not been altered, as long as these principles     have not been amended, as long as that policy has not     been radically changed, the supplanting of European by     Indian agency will not make for self-government in this     country.    Nor is it from the British Government that Mr. Pal looks for, or would  accept, _Swaraj_:--       If the Government were to come and tell me to-day \"Take     _Swaraj\" I would say thank you for the gift, but I will not     have that which I cannot acquire by my own hand....     Our programme is that we shall so work in the country,     so combine the resources of the people, so organize the forces     of the nation, so develop the instincts of freedom in the community,     that by this means we shall--_shall_ in the imperative--compel     the submission to our will of any power that may set     itself against us.    Equally definite is Mr. Pal as to the methods by which _Swaraj_ is to be  made \"imperative.\" They consist of _Swadeshi_ in the economic domain,  i.e., the encouragement of native industries reinforced by the boycott  of imported goods which will kill British commerce and, in the political  domain, passive resistance reinforced by the boycott of Government  service.       They say:--Can you boycott all the Government offices?     Whoever said that we would? Whoever said that there     would not be found a single Indian to serve the Government     or the European community here? But what we can do is this.     We can make the Government impossible without entirely     making it impossible for them to find people to serve them.     The administration may be made impossible in a variety of     ways. It is not actually that every deputy magistrate     should say: I won't serve in it. It is not that when one     man resigns nobody will be found to take his place. But     if you create this spirit in the country the Government service     will gradually imbibe this spirit, and a whole office may go     on strike. That does not put an end to the administration,     but it creates endless complications in the work of administration,     and if these complications are created in every     part of the country, the administration will have been brought     to a deadlock and made none the less impossible, for the     primary thing is the prestige of the Government and the     boycott strikes at the root of that prestige.... We     can reduce every Indian in Government service to the position     of a man who has fallen from the dignity of Indian citizenship....     No man shall receive social honours because he is a     Hakim or a Munsiff or a Huzur Sheristadar.... No law     can compel one to give a chair to a man who comes to his     house. He may give it to an ordinary shopkeeper; he may     refuse it to the Deputy Magistrate or the Subordinate Judge.     He may give his daughter in marriage to a poor beggar,     he may refuse her to the son of a Deputy Magistrate, because     it is absolutely within his rights, absolutely within legal     bounds.       Passive resistance is recognized as legitimate in England.     It is legitimate in theory even in India, and if it is made     illegal by new legislation, these laws will infringe on the primary     rights of personal freedom and will tread on dangerous     grounds. Therefore it seems to me that by means of the boycott     we shall be able to do the negative work that will have     to be done for the attainment of _Swaraj_. Positive work     will have to be done. Without positive training no self-government     will come to the boycotter. It will (come)     through the organization of our village life; of     our talukas and districts. Let our programme     include the setting up of machinery for popular administration,     and running parallel to, but independent of, the existing     administration of the Government.... In the Providence     of God we shall then be made rulers over many things.     This is our programme.    But Mr. Pal himself admits that even if this programme can be fulfilled,  this _Swaraj_, this absolute self-rule which he asks for, is  fundamentally incompatible with the maintenance of the British  connexion.       Is really self-government within the Empire a practicable     ideal? What would it mean? It would mean either no     real self-government for us or no real overlordship for England.     Would we be satisfied with the shadow of self-government?     If not, would England be satisfied with the shadow of overlordship?     In either case England would not be satisfied     with a shadowy overlordship, and we refuse to be satisfied     with a shadowy self-government. And therefore no compromise     is possible under such conditions between self-government     in India and the overlordship of England. If self-government     is conceded to us, what would be England's     position not only in India, but in the British Empire itself?     Self-government means the right of self-taxation; it means     the right of financial control; it means the right of the     people to impose protective and prohibitive tariffs on foreign     imports. The moment we have the right of self-taxation,     what shall we do? We shall not try to be engaged in this     uphill work of industrial boycott. But we shall do what     every nation has done. Under the circumstances in which     we live now, we shall impose a heavy prohibitive protective     tariff upon every inch of textile fabric from Manchester,     upon every blade of knife that comes from Leeds. We shall     refuse to grant admittance to a British soul into our territory.     We would not allow British capital to be engaged in     the development of Indian resources, as it is now engaged.     We would not grant any right to British capitalists to dig     up the mineral wealth of the land and carry it to their own     isles. We shall want foreign capital. But we shall apply     for foreign loans in the open market of the whole world,     guaranteeing the credit of the Indian Government, the     Indian nation, for the repayment of the loan, just as America     has done and is doing, just as Russia is doing now, just as     Japan has been doing of late. And England's commercial     interests would not be furthered in the way these are being     furthered now, under the conditions of popular self-government,     though it might be within the Empire. But what     would it mean within the Empire? It would mean that     England would have to enter into some arrangement with     us for some preferential tariff. England would have to come     to our markets on the conditions that we would impose     upon her for the purpose, if she wanted an open door in     India, and after a while, when we have developed our resources     a little and organized our industrial life, we would want the     open door not only to England, but to every part of the     British Empire. And do you think it is possible for a small     country like England with a handful of population, although     she might be enormously wealthy, to compete on fair and     equitable terms with a mighty continent like India, with     immense natural resources, with her teeming populations,     the soberest and most abstemious populations known to any     part of the world?       If we have really self-government within the Empire, if     we have the rights of freedom of the Empire as Australia     has, as Canada has, as England has to-day, if we, 300 millions     of people, have that freedom of the Empire, the Empire     would cease to be British. It would be the Indian Empire,     and the alliance between England and India would be absolutely     an unequal alliance. That would be, if we had really     self-government within the Empire, exactly the relation as     co-partners in a co-British or anti-British Empire of the     future; and if the day comes when England will be reduced     to the alternative of having us as an absolutely independent     people or a co-partner with her in the Empire, she would     prefer to have us, like the Japanese, as an ally and no longer     a co-partner, because we are bound to be the predominant     partner in this Imperial firm. Therefore no sane Englishman,     politician or publicist can ever contemplate seriously the     possibility of a self-governing India, like the self-governing     colonies, forming a vital and organic part of the British     Empire. Therefore it is that Lord Morley says that so     long as India remains under the control of Great Britain     the government of India must continue to be a personal     and absolute one. Therefore it seems to me that this ideal,     the practically attainable ideal of self-government within the     Empire,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#5)"],[1,"succeeded, they allowed Delibes to write,  without assistance, his marvellous _Coppelia_. But Delibes had the  legitimate ambition of writing a grand opera. He never reached so far.    [Illustration: The Paris Opera]    Bizet and I were great friends and we told each other all our troubles.  \"You're less unfortunate than I am,\" he used to tell me. \"You can do  something besides things for the stage. I can't. That's my only  resource.\"    When Bizet put on the delightful _Pecheurs de Perles_--he was helped by  powerful influences--there was a general outcry and an outbreak of  abuse. The Devil himself straight from Hell would not have received a  worse reception. Later on, as we know, _Carmen_ was received in the  same way.    I was, indeed, able to do something beside work for the stage, and it  was just that which closed the stage to me. I was a writer of  symphonies, an organist and a pianist, so how could I be capable of  writing an opera! The qualities which go to make a pianist were in a  particularly bad light in the greenroom. Bizet played the piano  admirably, but he never dared to play in public for fear of making his  position worse.    I suggested to Carvalho that I write a _Macbeth_ for Madame Viardot.  Naturally enough he preferred to put on Verdi's _Macbeth_. It was an  utter failure and cost him thirty thousand francs.    They tried to interest a certain princess, a patron of the arts, in my  behalf. \"What,\" she replied, \"isn't he satisfied with his position? He  plays the organ at the Madeleine and the piano at my house. Isn't that  enough for him?\"    But that wasn't enough for me, and to overcome the obstacles, I caused a  scandal. At the age of twenty-eight I competed for the _Prix de Rome_!  They did not give it to me on the ground that I didn't need it, but the  day after the award, Auber, who was very fond of me, asked Carvalho for  a libretto for me. Carvalho gave me _Le Timbre d'Argent_, which he  didn't know what to do with as several musicians had refused to touch  it. There were good reasons for this, for, despite an excellent  foundation for the music, the libretto had serious faults. I demanded  that Barbier and Carre, the authors, should make important changes,  which they did at once. Then, I retired to the heights of Louveciennes  and in two months wrote the score of the five acts which the work had at  first.    I had to wait two years before Carvalho would consent to hear the music.  Finally, worn out by my importunities, they decided to get rid of me, so  Carvalho invited me to dine with him and to bring my score. After dinner  I went to the piano. Carvalho was on one side and Madame Carvalho on the  other. Both were very pleasant and charming, but the real meaning of  this friendliness did not escape me.    They had no doubts about what awaited them. Both really loved music and  little by little they fell under the spell. Serious attention succeeded  the false friendliness. At the end they were enthusiastic. Carvalho  declared that he would have the study of the work begun as soon as  possible; it was a masterpiece; it would have a great success, but to  assure this success, Madame Carvalho must sing the principal part.    Now the principal part in _Le Timbre d'Argent_ is that of a dancer and  the singer's part is greatly subordinate. To remedy this they decided to  develop the part. Barbier invented a pretty situation to bring in the  passage _Bonheur est chose legere_, but that wasn't enough. Barbier and  Carre racked their brains without finding any solution of the  difficulty, for on the stage as elsewhere there are problems that can't  be solved.    Between times they tried to find a dancer of the first rank. Finally,  they found one who had recently left the Opera, although still at the  height of her beauty and talent. And they continued to seek a way to  make the part of Helene worthy of Madame Carvalho.    The famous director had one mania. He wanted to collaborate in every  work he staged. Even a work hallowed by time and success had to bear  his mark; much greater were his reasons for interpolating in a new work.  He would announce brusquely that the period or the country in which the  action of the work took place must be changed. He tormented us for a  long time to make the dancer into a singer on his wife's account. Later,  he wanted to introduce a second dancer. With the exception of the  prologue and epilogue the action of the piece takes place in a dream,  and he took upon himself the invention of the most bizarre combinations.  He even proposed to me one day to introduce wild animals. Another time  he wanted to cut out all the music with the exception of the choruses  and the dancer's part, and have the rest played by a dramatic company.  Later, as they were rehearsing Hamlet at the Opera and it was rumored  that Mlle. Nilsson was going to play a water scene, he wanted Madame  Carvalho to go to the bottom of a pool to find the fatal bell.    Foolishness of this kind took up two years.    Finally, we gave up the idea of Mme. Carvalho's cooeperation. The part of  Helene was given to beautiful Mlle. Schroeder and the rehearsals began.  They were interrupted by the failure of the Theatre-Lyrique.    Shortly afterwards Perrin asked for _Le Timbre d'Argent_ for the Opera.  The adaptation of the work for the large stage at the Opera necessitated  important modifications. The whole of the dialogue had to be set to  music and the authors went to work on it. Perrin gave us Madame Carvalho  for Helene and Faure for Spiridion, but he wanted to burlesque the part  for the tenor and give it to Mlle. Wertheimber. He wanted to engage her  and had no other part for her. This was impossible. After several  discussions Perrin yielded to the obstinate refusals of the authors, but  I saw clearly from his attitude that he would never play our work.    About that time du Locle took over the management of the Opera-Comique.  He saw that Perrin, who was his uncle, had decided not to stage _Le  Timbre d'Argent_ and asked me for it.    This meant another metamorphosis for the work and new and considerable  work for the musician. And this work was by no means easy. Until this  time Barbier and Carre had been as close friends as Orestes and Pylades,  but now they had a falling out. What one proposed, the other  systematically refused. One lived in Paris; the other in the country. I  went from Paris to the country and from the country to Paris trying to  get these warring brothers to agree. This going to and fro lasted all  summer, and then the temporary enemies came to an understanding and  became as friendly as ever.    We seemed to be nearly at the end of our troubles. Du Locle had found a  wonderful dancer in Italy on whom we depended, but the dancer turned out  not to be one at all. She was a _mime_, and did not dance.    As there was no time to look for another dancer that season du Locle, to  keep me patient, had me write with Louis Gallet _La Princesse Jaune_,  with which I made my debut on the stage. I was thirty-five! This  harmless little work was received with the fiercest hostility. \"It is  impossible to tell,\" wrote Jouvin, a much feared critic of the time, \"in  what key or in what time the overture is written.\" And to show me how  utterly wrong I was, he told me that the public was \"a compound of  angles and shadows.\" His prose was certainly more obscure than my music.    Finally, a real dancer was engaged in Italy. It seemed as though nothing  more could prevent the appearance of the unfortunate _Timbre_. \"I can't  believe it,\" I said. \"Some catastrophe will put us off again.\"    War came!    When that frightful crisis was at an end, the dancer was re-engaged. The  parts were read to the artists, and the next day Amede Achard threw up  his role, declaring that it belonged to grand opera and was beyond the  powers of an opera-comique tenor. It is well known that he ended his  career at the Opera.    Another tenor had to be found, but tenors are rare birds and we were  unable to get one. To use the dancer he had engaged du Locle had Gallet  and Guiraud improvise a short act, _Le Kobold_, which met with great  success. The dancer was exquisite. Then du Locle lost interest in _Le  Timbre d'Argent_ and then came the failure of the Opera-Comique.    During all these tribulations I was preparing _Samson_, although I  could find no one who even wanted to hear me speak of it. They all  thought that I must be mad to attempt a Biblical subject. I gave a  hearing of the second act at my house, but no one understood it at all.  Without the aid of Liszt, who did not know a note of it, but who engaged  me to finish it and put it on at Weimar, _Samson_. would never have seen  the light. Afterwards it was refused in succession by Halanzier,  Vaucorbeil, and Ritt and Gailhard, who decided to take it only after  they had heard it sung by that admirable singer Rosine Bloch.    But to return to _Le Timbre d'Argent_. I was again on the street with my  score under my arm. About that time Vizentini revived the  Theatre-Lyrique. His first play was _Paul et Virginie_, a wonderful  success, and he was preparing for the close of the season another work  which he liked. They were kindly disposed to me at the Ministry of Fine  Arts and they interested themselves in my misfortunes. So they gave the  Theatre-Lyrique a small subsidy on condition that they play my work. I  came to the theatre as one who has meddled and I quickly recognized the  discomforts of my position. First, there was a search for a singer;  then, for a tenor, and they tried several without success. I found a  tenor who, according to all reports, was of the first rank, but, after  several days of negotiation, the matter was dropped. I learned later  from the artist that the manager intended to engage him for only four  performances, evidently planning that the work should be played only  four times.    The choice finally"]]]
