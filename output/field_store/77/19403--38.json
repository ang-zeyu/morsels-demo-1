[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16767"],[0,"Half-hours with the Telescope (#5)"],[1,"object not visible to the naked eye, but whose position with  reference to several visible stars is known; since, while it is easy to  bring the point required to the centre of the _finder's_ field, in which  the guiding stars are visible, it is very difficult to direct the  _telescope's_ tube on a point of this sort. A card tube with wire  fastenings, such as we have described, may appear a very insignificant  contrivance to the regular observer, with his well-mounted equatorial  and carefully-adjusted finder. But to the first attempts of the amateur  observer it affords no insignificant assistance, as I can aver from my  own experience. Without it--a superior finder being wanting--our  \"half-hours\" would soon be wasted away in that most wearisome and  annoying of all employments, trying to \"pick up\" celestial objects.    It behoves me at this point to speak of star-maps. Such maps are of many  different kinds. There are the Observatory maps, in which the places of  thousands of stars are recorded with an amazing accuracy. Our beginner  is not likely to make use of, or to want, such maps as these. Then there  are maps merely intended to give a good general idea of the appearance  of the heavens at different hours and seasons. Plate I. presents four  maps of this sort; but a more complete series of eight maps has been  published by Messrs. Walton and Maberly in an octavo work; and my own  'Constellation-Seasons' give, at the same price, twelve quarto maps (of  four of which those in Plate I. are miniatures), showing the appearance  of the sky at any hour from month to month, or on any night, at  successive intervals of two hours. But maps intermediate in character to  these and to Observatory maps are required by the amateur observer.  Such are the Society's six gnomonic maps, the set of six gnomonic maps  in Johnstone's 'Atlas of Astronomy,' and my own set of twelve gnomonic  maps. The Society's maps are a remarkably good set, containing on the  scale of a ten-inch globe all the stars in the Catalogue of the  Astronomical Society (down to the fifth magnitude). The distortion,  however, is necessarily enormous when the celestial sphere is presented  in only six gnomonic maps. In my maps all the stars of the British  Association Catalogue down to the fifth magnitude are included on the  scale of a six-inch globe. The distortion is scarcely a fourth of that  in the Society's maps. The maps are so arranged that the relative  positions of all the stars in each hemisphere can be readily gathered  from a single view; and black duplicate-maps serve to show the  appearance of the constellations.    It is often convenient to make small maps of a part of the heavens we  may wish to study closely. My 'Handbook of the Stars' has been prepared  to aid the student in the construction of such maps.    In selecting maps it is well to be able to recognise the amount of  distortion and scale-variation. This may be done by examining the spaces  included between successive parallels and meridians, near the edges and  angles of the maps, and comparing these either with those in the centre  of the map, or with the known figures and dimensions of the  corresponding spaces on a globe.    We may now proceed to discuss the different tests which the intending  purchaser of a telescope should apply to the instrument.    The excellence of an object-glass can be satisfactorily determined only  by testing the performance of the telescope in the manner presently to  be described. But it is well to examine the quality of the glass as  respects transparency and uniformity of texture. Bubbles, scratches, and  other such defects, are not very important, since they do not affect the  distinctness of the field as they would in a Galilean Telescope,--a  little light is lost, and that is all. The same remark applies to dust  upon the glass. The glass should be kept as free as possible from dirt,  damp, or dust, but it is not advisable to remove every speck which,  despite such precaution, may accidentally fall upon the object-glass.  When it becomes necessary to clean the glass, it is to be noted that the  substance used should be soft, perfectly dry, and free from dust. Silk  is often recommended, but some silk is exceedingly objectionable in  texture,--old silk, perfectly soft to the touch, is perhaps as good as  anything. If the dust which has fallen on the glass is at all gritty,  the glass will suffer by the method of cleaning commonly adopted, in  which the dust is _gathered up_ by pressure. The proper method is to  clean a small space near the edge of the glass, and to _sweep_ from that  space as centre. In this way the dust is _pushed before_ the silk or  wash-leather, and does not cut the glass. It is well always to suspect  the presence of gritty dust, and adopt this cautious method of cleaning.    The two glasses should on no account be separated.    In examining an eye-piece, the quality of the glass should be noted, and  care taken that both glasses (but especially the field-glass) are free  from the least speck, scratch, or blemish of any kind, for these defects  will be exhibited in a magnified state in the field of view. Hence the  eye-pieces require to be as carefully preserved from damp and dust as  the object-glass, and to be more frequently cleaned.    The tube of the telescope should be light, but strong, and free from  vibration. Its quality in the last respect can be tested by lightly  striking it when mounted; the sound given out should be dead or  non-resonant. The inside of the tube must absorb extraneous light, and  should therefore be coloured a dull black; and stops of varying radius  should be placed along its length with the same object. Sliding tubes,  rack-work, etc., should work closely, yet easily.    The telescope should be well balanced for vision with the small  astronomical eye-pieces. But as there is often occasion to use  appliances which disturb the balance, it is well to have the means of at  once restoring equilibrium. A cord ring running round the tube (pretty  tightly, so as to rest still when the tube is inclined), and bearing a  small weight, will be all that is required for this purpose; it must be  slipped along the tube until the tube is found to be perfectly balanced.  Nothing is more annoying than, after getting a star well in the field,  to see the tube shift its position through defective balance, and thus  to have to search again for the star. Even with such an arrangement as  is shown in fig. 8, though the tube cannot readily shift its position,  it is better to have it well balanced.    The quality of the stand has a very important influence on the  performance of a telescope. In fact, a moderately good telescope,  mounted on a steady stand, working easily and conveniently, will not  only enable the observer to pass his time much more pleasantly, but will  absolutely exhibit more difficult objects than a finer instrument on a  rickety, ill-arranged stand. A good observing-chair is also a matter of  some importance, the least constraint or awkwardness of position  detracting considerably from the power of distinct vision. Such, at  least, is my own experience.    But the mere examination of the glasses, tube, mounting, &c., is only  the first step in the series of tests which should be applied to a  telescope, since the excellence of the instrument depends, not on its  size, the beauty of its mounting, or any extraneous circumstances, but  on its performance.    The observer should first determine whether the chromatic aberration is  corrected. To ascertain this the telescope should be directed to the  moon, or (better) to Jupiter, and accurately focussed for distinct  vision. If, then, on moving the eye-piece towards the object-glass, a  ring of purple appears round the margin of the object, and on moving the  eye-glass in the contrary direction a ring of green, the chromatic  aberration is corrected, since these are the colours of the secondary  spectrum.    To determine whether the spherical aberration is corrected, the  telescope should be directed towards a star of the third or fourth  magnitude, and focussed for distinct vision. A cap with an aperture of  about one-half its diameter should then be placed over the object-glass.  If no new adjustment is required for distinct vision, the spherical  aberration is corrected, since the mean focal length and the focal  length of the central rays are equal. If, when the cap is on, the  eye-piece has to be pulled out for distinct vision, the spherical  aberration has not been fully corrected; if the eye-piece has to be  pushed in, the aberration has been over-corrected. As a further test, we  may cut off the central rays, by means of a circular card covering the  middle of the object-glass, and compare the focal length for distinct  vision with the focal length when the cap is applied. The extent of the  spherical aberration may be thus determined; but if the first experiment  gives a satisfactory result, no other is required.    A star of the first magnitude should next be brought into the field of  view. If an irradiation from one side is perceived, part of the  object-glass has not the same refractive power as the rest; and the  part which is defective can be determined by applying in different  positions a cap which hides half the object-glass. If the irradiation is  double, it will probably be found that the object-glass has been too  tightly screwed, and the defect will disappear when the glass is freed  from such undue pressure.    If the object-glass is not quite at right angles to the axis of the  tube, or if the eye-tube is at all inclined, a like irradiation will  appear when a bright star is in the field. The former defect is not  easily detected or remedied; nor is it commonly met with in the work of  a careful optician. The latter defect may be detected by cutting out  three circular cards of suitable size with a small aperture"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16772"],[0,"The Story of a Soul (L'Histoire d'une Âme): The Autobiography of St. Thérèse of (#5)"],[1,"also her companion, the poor child whom  my Mother dressed, according to the touching custom of the  well-to-do families in Alencon. This child did not leave Leonie  for an instant on that happy day, and in the evening at the grand  dinner she sat in the place of honour. Alas! I was too small to  stay up for this feast, but I shared in it a little, thanks to  Papa's goodness, for he came himself to bring his little Queen a  piece of the iced cake.    The only one now left to speak of is Celine, the companion of my  childhood. My memories of her are so many that I do not know which  to choose. We understood each other perfectly, but I was much more  forward and lively, and far less ingenuous. Here is a letter which  will show you, dear Mother, how sweet was Celine, and how naughty  Therese. I was then nearly three years old, and Celine six and a  half. \"Celine is naturally inclined to be good; as to the little  puss, Therese, one cannot tell how she will turn out, she is so  young and heedless. She is a very intelligent child, but has not  nearly so sweet a disposition as her sister, and her stubbornness  is almost unconquerable. When she has said 'No,' nothing will make  her change; one could leave her all day in the cellar without  getting her to say 'Yes.' She would sooner sleep there.\"    I had another fault also, of which my Mother did not speak in her  letters: it was self-love. Here are two instances:--One day, no  doubt wishing to see how far my pride would go, she smiled and  said to me, \"Therese, if you will kiss the ground I will give you  a halfpenny.\" In those days a halfpenny was a fortune, and in  order to gain it I had not far to stoop, for I was so tiny there  was not much distance between me and the ground; but my pride was  up in arms, and holding myself very erect, I said, \"No, thank you,  Mamma, I would rather go without it.\"    Another time we were going into the country to see some friends.  Mamma told Marie to put on my prettiest frock, but not to let me  have bare arms. I did not say a word, and appeared as indifferent  as children of that age should be, but I said to myself, \"I should  have looked much prettier with bare arms.\"    With such a disposition I feel sure that had I been brought up by  careless parents I should have become very wicked, and perhaps  have lost my soul. But Jesus watched over His little Spouse, and  turned even her faults to advantage, for, being checked early in  life, they became a means of leading her towards perfection. For  instance, as I had great self-love and an innate love of good as  well, it was enough to tell me once: \"You must not do that,\" and I  never wanted to do it again. Having only good example before my  eyes, I naturally wished to follow it, and I see with pleasure in  my Mother's letters that as I grew older I began to be a greater  comfort. This is what she writes in 1876: \"Even Therese is anxious  to make sacrifices. Marie has given her little sisters a string of  beads on purpose to count their acts of self-denial. They have  really spiritual, but very amusing, conversations together. Celine  said the other day: 'How can God be in such a tiny Host?' Therese  answered: 'That is not strange, because God is Almighty!' 'And  what does Almighty mean?' 'It means that He can do whatever He  likes.'    \"But it is more amusing still to see Therese put her hand in her  pocket, time after time, to pull a bead along the string, whenever  she makes a little sacrifice. The children are inseparable, and  are quite sufficient company for one another. Nurse has given  Therese two bantams, and every day after dinner she and Celine sit  by the fire and play with them.    \"One morning Therese got out of her cot and climbed into Celine's.  The nurse went to fetch her to be dressed, and, when at last she  found her, the little thing said, hugging her sister very hard:  'Oh, Louise! leave me here, don't you see that we are like the  little white bantams, we can't be separated from one another.'\"    It is quite true that I could not be separated from Celine; I  would rather leave my dessert unfinished at table than let her go  without me, and I would get down from my high chair when she did,  and off we went to play together. On Sundays, as I was still too  small to go to the long services, Mamma stayed at home to take  care of me. I was always very good, walking about on tip-toe; but  as soon as I heard the door open there was a tremendous outburst  of joy--I threw myself on my dear little sister, exclaiming: \"Oh,  Celine! give me the blessed bread, quick!\"[8] One day she had not  brought any--what was to be done? I could not do without it, for I  called this little feast my Mass. A bright idea struck me: \"You  have no blessed bread!--make some.\" Celine immediately opened the  cupboard, took out the bread, cut a tiny bit off, and after saying  a Hail Mary quite solemnly over it, triumphantly presented it to  me; and I, making the sign of the Cross, ate it with devotion,  fancying it tasted exactly like the real blessed bread.    One day Leonie, thinking no doubt that she was too big to play  with dolls, brought us a basket filled with clothes, pretty pieces  of stuff, and other trifles on which her doll was laid: \"Here,  dears,\" she said, \"choose whatever you like.\" Celine looked at it,  and took a woollen ball. After thinking about it for a minute, I  put out my hand saying: \"I choose everything,\" and I carried off  both doll and basket without more ado.    This childish incident was a forecast, so to speak, of my whole  life. Later on, when the way of perfection was opened out before  me, I realised that in order to become a Saint one must suffer  much, always seek the most perfect path, and forget oneself. I  also understood that there are many degrees of holiness, that each  soul is free to respond to the calls of Our Lord, to do much or  little for His Love--in a word, to choose amongst the sacrifices  He asks. And then also, as in the days of my childhood, I cried  out: \"My God, I choose everything, I will not be a Saint by  halves, I am not afraid of suffering for Thee, I only fear one  thing, and that is to do my own will. Accept the offering of my  will, for I choose all that Thou willest.\"    But, dear Mother, I am forgetting myself--I must not tell you yet  of my girlhood, I am still speaking of the baby of three and four  years old.    I remember a dream I had at that age which impressed itself very  deeply on my memory. I thought I was walking alone in the garden  when, suddenly, I saw near the arbour two hideous little devils  dancing with surprising agility on a barrel of lime, in spite of  the heavy irons attached to their feet. At first they cast fiery  glances at me; then, as though suddenly terrified, I saw them, in  the twinkling of an eye, throw themselves down to the bottom of  the barrel, from which they came out somehow, only to run and hide  themselves in the laundry which opened into the garden. Finding  them such cowards, I wanted to know what they were going to do,  and, overcoming my fears, I went to the window. The wretched  little creatures were there, running about on the tables, not  knowing how to hide themselves from my gaze. From time to time  they came nearer, peering through the windows with an uneasy air,  then, seeing that I was still there, they began to run about again  looking quite desperate. Of course this dream was nothing  extraordinary; yet I think Our Lord made use of it to show me that  a soul in the state of grace has nothing to fear from the devil,  who is a coward, and will even fly from the gaze of a little child.    Dear Mother, how happy I was at that age! I was beginning to enjoy  life, and goodness itself seemed full of charms. Probably my  character was the same as it is now, for even then I had great  self-command, and made a practice of never complaining when my  things were taken; even if I was unjustly accused, I preferred to  keep silence. There was no merit in this, for I did it naturally.    How quickly those sunny years of my childhood passed away, and  what tender memories they have imprinted on my mind! I remember  the Sunday walks when my dear Mother always accompanied us; and I  can still feel the impression made on my childish heart at the  sight of the fields bright with cornflowers, poppies, and  marguerites. Even at that age I loved far-stretching views, sunlit  spaces and stately trees; in a word, all nature charmed me and  lifted up my soul to Heaven.    Often, during these walks, we met poor people. I was always chosen  to give them an alms, which made me feel very happy. Sometimes, my  dear Father, knowing the way was too long for his little Queen,  took me home. This was a cause of grief, and to console me Celine  would fill her basket with daisies, and give them to me on her  return. Truly everything on earth smiled on me; I found flowers  strewn at every step, and my naturally happy disposition helped to  make life bright. But a new era was about to dawn.    I was to be the Spouse of Our Lord at such an early age that it  was necessary I should suffer from my childhood. As the early  spring flowers begin to come up under the snow and open at the  first rays of the sun, so the Little Flower whose story I am  writing had to pass through the winter of trial and to have her  tender cup filled with the dew of tears.  ______________________________    [1] Ps. 88[89]:1.
