Efforts to verify it brought forth the fact that  it sprang into being in the early days of the Civil War and was  evidently a fabrication born of the bitter spirit of the hour.    It was not from his father, however, that Lincoln inherited any of his  remarkable traits. The dark coarse hair, the gray eyes, sallow  complexion, and brawny strength, which were his, constituted his sole  inheritance on the paternal side. But Nancy Hanks was gentle and  refined, and would have adorned any station in life. She was beautiful  in youth, with dark hair, regular features, and soft sparkling hazel  eyes. She was unusually intelligent, and read all the books she could  obtain. Says Mr. Arnold: \"She was a woman of deep religious feeling, of  the most exemplary character, and most tenderly and affectionately  devoted to her family. Her home indicated a love of beauty exceptional  in the wild settlement in which she lived, and judging from her early  death it is probable that she was of a physique less hardy than that of  those among whom she lived. Hers was a strong, self-reliant spirit,  which commanded the love and respect of the rugged people among whom she  dwelt.\"    The tender and reverent spirit of Abraham Lincoln, and the pensive  melancholy of his disposition, he no doubt inherited from his mother.  Amid the toil and struggle of her busy life she found time not only to  teach him to read and write but to impress upon him ineffaceably that  love of truth and justice, that perfect integrity and reverence for God,  for which he was noted all his life. Lincoln always looked upon his  mother with unspeakable affection, and never ceased to cherish the  memory of her life and teaching.    A spirit of restlessness, a love of adventure, a longing for new scenes,  and possibly the hope of improving his condition, led Thomas Lincoln to  abandon the Rock Spring farm, in the fall of 1816, and begin life over  again in the wilds of southern Indiana. The way thither lay through  unbroken country and was beset with difficulties. Often the travellers  were obliged to cut their road as they went. With the resolution of  pioneers, however, they began the journey. At the end of several days  they had gone but eighteen miles. Abraham Lincoln was then but seven  years old, but was already accustomed to the use of axe and gun. He lent  a willing hand, and bore his share in the labor and fatigue connected  with the difficult journey. In after years he said that he had never  passed through a more trying experience than when he went from  Thompson's Ferry to Spencer County, Indiana. On arriving, a shanty for  immediate use was hastily erected. Three sides were enclosed, the fourth  remaining open. This served as a home for several months, when a more  comfortable cabin was built. On the eighteenth of October, 1817, Thomas  Lincoln entered a quarter-section of government land eighteen miles  north of the Ohio river and about a mile and a half from the present  village of Gentryville. About a year later they were followed by the  family of Thomas and Betsy Sparrow, relatives of Mrs. Lincoln and  old-time neighbors on the Rock Spring farm in Kentucky. Dennis Hanks, a  member of the Sparrow household and cousin of Abraham Lincoln, came  also. He has furnished some recollections of the President's boyhood  which are well worth recording. \"Uncle Dennis,\" as he was familiarly  called, was himself a striking character, a man of original manners and  racy conversation. A sketch of him as he appeared to an observer in his  later days is thus given: \"Uncle Dennis is a typical Kentuckian, born in  Hardin County in 1799. His face is sun-bronzed and ploughed with the  furrows of time, but he has a resolute mouth, a firm grip of the jaws,  and a broad forehead above a pair of piercing eyes. The eyes seem out of  place in the weary, faded face, but they glow and flash like two diamond  sparks set in ridges of dull gold. The face is a serious one, but the  play of light in the eyes, unquenchable by time, betrays a nature of  sunshine and elate with life. A glance at the profile shows a face  strikingly Lincoln-like,--prominent cheek bones, temple, nose, and chin;  but best of all is that twinkling drollery in the eye that flashed in  the White House during the dark days of the Civil War.\"    Uncle Dennis's recollections go back to the birth of Abraham Lincoln. To  use his own words: \"I rikkilect I run all the way, over two miles, to  see Nancy Hanks's boy baby. Her name was Nancy Hanks before she married  Thomas Lincoln. 'Twas common for connections to gather in them days to  see new babies. I held the wee one a minute. I was ten years old, and it  tickled me to hold the pulpy, red little Lincoln. The family moved to  Indiana,\" he went on, \"when Abe was about nine. Mr. Lincoln moved first,  and built a camp of brush in Spencer County. We came a year later, and  he had then a cabin. So he gave us the shanty. Abe killed a turkey the  day we got there, and couldn't get through tellin' about it. The name  was pronounced Linkhorn by the folks then. We was all uneducated. After  a spell we learnt better. I was the only boy in the place all them  years, and Abe and me was always together.\"    Dennis Hanks claims to have taught his young cousin to read, write, and  cipher. \"He knew his letters pretty wellish, but no more. His mother had  taught him. If ever there was a good woman on earth, she was one,--a  true Christian of the Baptist church. But she died soon after we  arrived, and Abe was left without a teacher. His father couldn't read a  word. The boy had only about one quarter of schooling, hardly that. I  then set in to help him. I didn't know much, but I did the best I could.  Sometimes he would write with a piece of charcoal or the p'int of a  burnt stick on the fence or floor. We got a little paper at the country  town, and I made some ink out of blackberry briar-root and a little  copperas in it. It was black, but the copperas ate the paper after a  while. I made Abe's first pen out of a turkey-buzzard feather. We had no  geese them days. After he learned to write his name he was scrawlin' it  everywhere. Sometimes he would write it in the white sand down by the  crick bank and leave it there till the waves would blot it out. He  didn't take to books in the beginnin'. We had to hire him at first, but  after he got a taste on't it was the old story--we had to pull the sow's  ears to get her to the trough, and then pull her tail to get her away.  He read a great deal, and had a wonderful memory--wonderful. Never  forgot anything.\"    Lincoln's first reading book was Webster's Speller. \"When I got him  through that,\" said Uncle Dennis, \"I had only a copy of the Indiana  Statutes. Then Abe got hold of a book. I can't rikkilect the name. It  told a yarn about a feller, a nigger or suthin', that sailed a flatboat  up to a rock, and the rock was magnetized and drawed all the nails out,  and he got a duckin' or drowned or suthin',--I forget now. [It was the  \"Arabian Nights.\"] Abe would lay on the floor with a chair under his  head and laugh over them stories by the hour. I told him they was likely  lies from beginnin' to end, but he learned to read right well in them. I  borrowed for him the Life of Washington and the Speeches of Henry Clay.  They had a powerful influence on him. He told me afterwards in the White  House he wanted to live like Washington. His speeches show it, too. But  the other book did the most amazin' work. Abe was a Democrat, like his  father and all of us, when he began to read it. When he closed it he was  a Whig, heart and soul, and he went on step by step till he became  leader of the Republicans.\"    These reminiscences of Dennis Hanks give the clearest and undoubtedly  the most accurate glimpse of Lincoln's youth. He says further, referring  to the boy's unusual physical strength: \"My, how he would chop! His axe  would flash and bite into a sugar-tree or sycamore, and down it would  come. If you heard him fellin' trees in a clearin' you would say there  was three men at work, the way the trees fell. Abe was never sassy or  quarrelsome. I've seen him walk into a crowd of sawin' rowdies and tell  some droll yarn and bust them all up. It was the same after he got to be  a lawyer. All eyes was on him whenever he riz. There was _suthin'  peculiarsome_ about him. I moved from Indiana to Illinois when Abe did.  I bought a little improvement near him, six miles from Decatur. Here the  famous rails were split that were carried round in the campaign. They  were called _his_ rails, but you never can tell. I split some of 'em. He  was a master hand at maulin' rails. I heard him say in a speech once,  'If I didn't make these I made many just as good.' Then the crowd  yelled.\"    One of his playmates has furnished much that is of interest in regard to  the reputation which Lincoln left behind him in the neighborhood where  he passed his boyhood and much of his youth. This witness says:  \"Whenever the court was in session he was a frequent attendant. John A.  Breckenridge was the foremost lawyer in the community, and was famed as  an advocate in criminal cases. Lincoln was sure to be present when he  spoke. Doing the chores in the morning, he would walk to Booneville, the  county seat of Warwick County, seventeen miles away, then home in time  to do the chores at night, repeating this day after day. The lawyer soon  came to know him. Years afterwards, when Lincoln was President, a  venerable gentleman one day entered his office in the White House, and  standing before him said: 'Mr. President, you don't know me.' Mr.  Lincoln eyed him sharply for a moment, and then quickly replied with a  smile, 'Yes I do. You are John A. Breckenridge. I used to walk  thirty-four miles a day to hear you plead law in Booneville, and  listening to your speeches at the bar first inspired me with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],[0,"An English Grammar (#5)"],[1,"ter_, _trickster_, _punster_.      [Sidenote: _Ending of masculine not changed._]    30. The ending _-ess_ is added to many words without changing the  ending of the masculine; as,--      baron--baroness    count--countess    lion--lioness    Jew--Jewess    heir--heiress    host--hostess    priest--priestess    giant--giantess    [Sidenote: _Masculine ending dropped._]    The masculine ending may be dropped before the feminine _-ess_ is  added; as,--      abbot--abbess    negro--negress    murderer--murderess    sorcerer--sorceress    [Sidenote: _Vowel dropped before adding_ -ess.]    The feminine may discard a vowel which appears in the masculine; as  in--      actor--actress    master--mistress    benefactor--benefactress    emperor--empress    tiger--tigress    enchanter--enchantress    _Empress_ has been cut down from _emperice_ (twelfth century) and  _emperesse_ (thirteenth century), from Latin _imperatricem_.    _Master_ and _mistress_ were in Middle English  _maister_--_maistresse_, from the Old French _maistre_--_maistresse_.      31. When the older _-en_ and _-ster_ went out of use as the  distinctive mark of the feminine, the ending _-ess_, from the French  _-esse_, sprang into a popularity much greater than at present.    [Sidenote: _Ending_ -ess _less used now than formerly._]    Instead of saying _doctress_, _fosteress_, _wagoness_, as was said in  the sixteenth century, or _servauntesse_, _teacheresse_,  _neighboresse_, _frendesse_, as in the fourteenth century, we have  dispensed with the ending in many cases, and either use a prefix word  or leave the masculine to do work for the feminine also.    Thus, we say _doctor_ (masculine and feminine) or _woman doctor_,  _teacher_ or _lady teacher_, _neighbor_ (masculine and feminine), etc.  We frequently use such words as _author_, _editor_, _chairman_, to  represent persons of either sex.    NOTE.--There is perhaps this distinction observed: when we speak of a  female _as an active agent_ merely, we use the masculine termination,  as, \"George Eliot is the _author_ of 'Adam Bede;'\" but when we speak  purposely _to denote a distinction from a male_, we use the feminine,  as, \"George Eliot is an eminent _authoress_.\"        III. Gender shown by Different Words.      32. In some of these pairs, the feminine and the masculine are  entirely different words; others have in their origin the same root.  Some of them have an interesting history, and will be noted below:--      bachelor--maid    boy--girl    brother--sister    drake--duck    earl--countess    father--mother    gander--goose    hart--roe    horse--mare    husband--wife    king--queen    lord--lady    wizard--witch    nephew--niece    ram--ewe    sir--madam    son--daughter    uncle--aunt    bull--cow    boar--sow    Girl originally meant a child of either sex, and was used for male  or female until about the fifteenth century.    Drake is peculiar in that it is formed from a corresponding feminine  which is no longer used. It is not connected historically with our  word _duck_, but is derived from _ened_ (duck) and an obsolete suffix  _rake_ (king). Three letters of _ened_ have fallen away, leaving our  word _drake_.    Gander and goose were originally from the same root word. _Goose_  has various cognate forms in the languages akin to English (German  _Gans_, Icelandic _gas_, Danish _gaas_, etc.). The masculine was  formed by adding _-a_, the old sign of the masculine. This _gansa_ was  modified into _gan-ra_, _gand-ra_, finally _gander_; the _d_ being  inserted to make pronunciation easy, as in many other words.    Mare, in Old English _mere_, had the masculine _mearh_ (horse), but  this has long been obsolete.    Husband and wife are not connected in origin. _Husband_ is a  Scandinavian word (Anglo-Saxon _husbonda_ from Icelandic _hus-bondi_,  probably meaning house dweller); _wife_ was used in Old and Middle  English to mean woman in general.    King and queen are said by some (Skeat, among others) to be from  the same root word, but the German etymologist Kluge says they are  not.    Lord is said to be a worn-down form of the Old English _hlaf-weard_  (loaf keeper), written _loverd_, _lhauerd_, or _lauerd_ in Middle  English. Lady is from _hloefdige_ (_hloef_ meaning loaf, and  _dige_ being of uncertain origin and meaning).    Witch is the Old English _wicce_, but wizard is from the Old  French _guiscart_ (prudent), not immediately connected with _witch_,  though both are ultimately from the same root.    Sir is worn down from the Old French _sire_ (Latin _senior_).  Madam is the French _ma dame_, from Latin _mea domina_.      [Sidenote: _Two masculines from feminines._]    33. Besides _gander_ and _drake_, there are two other masculine  words that were formed from the feminine:--    Bridegroom, from Old English _bryd-guma_ (bride's man). The _r_ in  _groom_ has crept in from confusion with the word _groom_.    Widower, from the weakening of the ending _-a_ in Old English to  _-e_ in Middle English. The older forms, _widuwa_--_widuwe_, became  identical, and a new masculine ending was therefore added to  distinguish the masculine from the feminine (compare Middle English  _widuer_--_widewe_).      Personification.      34. Just as abstract ideas are personified (Sec. 16), material  objects may be spoken of like gender nouns; for example,--         \"Now, where the swift _Rhone_ cleaves _his_ way.\"--BYRON.         The _Sun_ now rose upon the right:       Out of the sea came _he_.       --COLERIDGE.         And haply the _Queen Moon_ is on _her_ throne,       Clustered around by all her starry Fays.       --KEATS,         _Britannia_ needs no bulwarks,       No towers along the steep;       _Her_ march is o'er the mountain waves,       _Her_ home is on the deep.       --CAMPBELL    This is not exclusively a poetic use. In ordinary speech  personification is very frequent: the pilot speaks of his boat as  feminine; the engineer speaks so of his engine; etc.    [Sidenote: _Effect of personification._]    In such cases the gender is marked by the pronoun, and not by the form  of the noun. But the fact that in English the distinction of gender is  confined to difference of sex makes these departures more effective.        NUMBER.      [Sidenote: _Definition._]    35. In nouns, number means the mode of indicating whether we are  speaking of one thing or of more than one.      36. Our language has two numbers,--_singular_ and _plural_. The  singular number denotes that one thing is spoken of; the plural, more  than one.      37. There are three ways of changing the singular form to the  plural:--    (1) By adding _-en_.    (2) By changing the root vowel.    (3) By adding _-s_ (or _-es_).    The first two methods prevailed, together with the third, in Old  English, but in modern English _-s_ or _-es_ has come to be the  \"standard\" ending; that is, whenever we adopt a new word, we make its  plural by adding _-s_ or _-es._      I. Plurals formed by the Suffix _-en_.      [Sidenote: _The_ -en _inflection._]    38. This inflection remains only in the word oxen, though it was  quite common in Old and Middle English; for instance, _eyen_ (eyes),  _treen_ (trees), _shoon_ (shoes), which last is still used in Lowland  Scotch. _Hosen_ is found in the King James version of the Bible, and  _housen_ is still common in the provincial speech in England.      39. But other words were inflected afterwards, in imitation of the  old words in _-en_ by making a double plural.    [Sidenote: -En _inflection imitated by other words._]    Brethren has passed through three stages. The old plural was  _brothru_, then _brothre_ or _brethre_, finally _brethren_. The  weakening of inflections led to this addition.    Children has passed through the same history, though the  intermediate form _childer_ lasted till the seventeenth century in  literary English, and is still found in dialects; as,--         \"God bless me! so then, after all, you'll have a chance to see       your _childer_ get up like, and get settled.\"--QUOTED BY DE       QUINCEY.    Kine is another double plural, but has now no singular.         In spite of wandering _kine_ and other adverse       circumstance.--THOREAU.      II. Plurals formed by Vowel Change.      40. Examples of this inflection are,--      man--men    foot--feet    goose--geese    louse--lice    mouse--mice    tooth--teeth    Some other words--as _book_, _turf_, _wight_, _borough_--formerly had  the same inflection, but they now add the ending _-s_.      41. Akin to this class are some words, originally neuter, that have  the singular and plural alike; such as _deer_, _sheep_, _swine_, etc.    Other words following the same usage are, _pair_, _brace_, _dozen_,  after numerals (if not after numerals, or if preceded by the  prepositions _in_, _by_, etc, they add _-s_): also _trout_, _salmon_;  _head_, _sail_; _cannon_; _heathen_, _folk_, _people_.    The words _horse_ and _foot_, when they mean soldiery, retain the  same form for plural meaning; as,--         The _foot_ are fourscore thousand,       The _horse_ are thousands ten.       --MACAULAY.         Lee marched over the mountain wall,--       Over the mountains winding down,       _Horse_ and _foot_, into Frederick town.       --WHITTIER.        III. Plurals formed by Adding -s or -es.      42. Instead of _-s,_ the ending _-es_ is added--    (1) If a word ends in a letter which cannot add _-s_ and be  pronounced. Such are _box, cross, ditch, glass, lens, quartz_, etc.    [Sidenote: _-Es added in certain cases_.]    If the word ends in a _sound_ which cannot add _-s_, a new syllable is  made; as, _niche--niches, race--races, house--houses, prize--prizes,  chaise--chaises_, etc.    _-Es_ is also added to a few words ending in -o, though this sound  combines readily with _-s_, and does not make an extra syllable:  _cargo--cargoes, negro--negroes, hero--heroes, volcano--volcanoes_,  etc.    Usage differs somewhat in other words of this class, "]]]
