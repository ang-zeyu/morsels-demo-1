One evening Neville was playing alone on the top of the hill when he  noticed that one of the very finest sunsets he had ever seen was just  coming on. The sky in the West, away over the broad country lands, was  filled with little clouds of all sorts and shapes, and they were just  beginning to take on the most wonderful colours.    Neville had often before amused himself with watching clouds and the  strange shapes into which they changed themselves--sometimes like  great mountain ranges, sometimes like sea-waves, and very often like  elephants and lions and seals and all manner of interesting things of  that sort. But never before had he been able to make out so many  animal shapes in the clouds. The sky was almost as good as a Zoo.  There were kangaroos and elephants and a hen with chickens and  wallabies and rabbits and a funny man with large ears and all sorts of  other peculiar shapes.    The sun was sinking behind a distant range of hills, where a golden  light shone out as if through a gateway. It was so much like a great  golden gateway that Neville fell to wondering what might be found on  the other side of it.    Suddenly, right in the middle of all the coloured clouds, he saw one  little cloud which was perfectly white, and, as he watched it, he  noticed that it seemed to be shaped like a small horse. A very small  horse it seemed at that distance; but, as Neville gazed, it grew  bigger and bigger, just as if it were coming toward him very fast, and  he was almost certain he could see its legs moving.    That startled him a little, and so he rubbed his eyes to make sure  that they were not playing him tricks.    When he looked again he was more startled than ever; for the little  white cloud was no longer a cloud, but a little white horse in real  earnest. Besides, it had just left the sky and was galloping down the  mountain range which he could see away in the West.    In two minutes it had left the range, and was coming across the fields  towards him, jumping the fences, dodging under the trees, and racing  across the plain with its white mane and tail tossing as it came. It  seemed to be making straight for him.    He was not really frightened--you must not think that about him--but  he was just beginning to wonder if it were not nearly time to go home  to dinner, when he noticed that the white horse had stopped, just at  the foot of the bald hill. It was looking up at him, tossing its head  and pawing the ground--the most beautiful white horse that he had ever  seen, even in a circus. Then it appeared to get over its excitement  and began to trot quietly up the hill toward him.    I do not think anyone would have blamed Neville if he had decided then  to go home to dinner at once. But he was rather a brave boy, and he  was certainly very curious, so he just stood still and waited.    And here is where the most wonderful part of the story begins. The  white horse trotted up to Neville and spoke to him. That would  surprise most people; and Neville was certainly as much surprised as  anyone else would have been.    \"What are you frightened of?\" asked the white horse in a loud voice.    Now, Neville WAS just a little frightened by this time; but he was not  going to show it, so he just said, \"Who's frightened?\"    \"YOU'RE frightened,\" said the white horse, louder than ever. \"You're  only a timid little boy. I thought when I saw you in the distance that  you were one of the plucky ones; but I was mistaken. You're just a  little cowardly-custard.\"    \"You'd better be careful who you're talking to,\" said Neville,  suddenly losing his fear. (Little boys do not always talk good  grammar; otherwise he would have said \"whom\" not \"who.\") He hated to  be called a \"cowardly-custard.\" \"You'd better be careful, or I'll give  you a bang!\"    \"Ah ha!\" cried the white horse. \"Very brave all at once, aren't you?  All the same, you're afraid to come near and stroke me.\"    \"But I don't want to stroke you,\" said Neville.    \"I thought not,\" replied the white horse. \"I thought not, the moment I  got close to you. You're one of the frightened ones, and I've been  wasting my time.\"    \"Who's frightened?\" said Neville again.    \"You asked that before,\" replied the white horse, \"and I told you. If  you're not frightened, come along and stroke me. There's nothing to be  afraid of.\"    So Neville walked right up to the white horse and stroked his  shoulder. And at once he felt that he had been foolish to hold back.  For of all the smooth, soft, silky coats he had ever stroked, that of  the white horse was certainly the smoothest, and the softest, and the  silkiest. He felt that he could go on stroking it for hours.    \"There now,\" said the white horse in a voice as soft and silky as his  coat. \"There was nothing to be afraid of, was there? And I think that  perhaps I was mistaken about you. I rather think you might be one of  those daring boys that one reads about in stories. What about jumping  on my back for a little ride?\"    Neville ceased to stroke the white horse and drew back a little.    \"I'm afraid they'll be expecting me home for dinner,\" he said. \"I'm  very pleased indeed to have met you.\" Neville was always a polite  little boy.    \"The very thing!\" cried the white horse. \"Jump on my back and I'll  take you home. You liked stroking me, didn't you? Well that's nothing  to the ride you will enjoy--simply nothing. Why, all the boldest  riders in the world would give their ears just for one little ride on  my back. Now then! One, two, three, and up you go!\"    Then before Neville quite knew what he was doing, he made a little run  and leapt up astride of the white horse.    \"I live just over there,\" said Neville, pointing towards his home.    But before he could say \"knife\", or even \"scissors\" (supposing he had  wished to say either of these words), the white horse laughed a nasty  hollow laugh, sprang upwards from the ground, and was soaring through  the air toward the dying sunset, right away from home and dinner.    Neville clung on tightly, for he was so high above the earth that to  fall off would mean the end of him. And far beneath him he saw the  green fields and the white road, which now seemed like a mere thread.    \"That's not fair! Whoa back! Whoa back!\" he shouted to the white  horse; but the white horse made no reply. Indeed, he seemed suddenly  not so much like a white horse as like a white cloud shaped like a  horse, and Neville saw that he no longer sat upon the horse's silky  coat, but upon something soft and downy like a white fleece, and it  was slightly damp. Then he knew that he was riding upon a cloud; and,  as it was quite absurd to go on talking to a cloud, he ceased to cry  out. He just sat tight and wondered what would happen next.    He was high over a farm-house now: one that he used to see from the  bald hill. He knew it by the tall pine-trees that grew round it; and  down in the farm-yard he saw a man with a bucket going out to feed the  calves. Neville called loudly to him, but the man did not even look  up. Now he was far beyond that farm-house and above an orchard, where  he saw the fruit-trees standing in straight rows; and a few seconds  later the mountain range was beneath him, and Neville knew that the  cloud that looked like a horse was making straight for the golden  gateway, which was now glowing dully in a grey sky. He was riding into  the sunset.    Swiftly as the wind that drove it, the Cloud Horse drifted over the  mountain range. There was a sudden glow of golden light all about him,  and then a flash of colour so wonderful that Neville could not bear to  look. He closed his eyes, and, as he did so, he felt that the Cloud  Horse had come to a halt at last.    So Neville sat upon the cloud, not daring to open his eyes for quite a  long time. When at last he did look again he almost fainted with the  wonder of it. He was inside the sunset.    But scarcely had he begun to enjoy the wonderful sight, when he was  startled by the sound of a funny, shrill little voice close by his  side. Looking down, he saw a strange little man, no taller than a  walking-stick, and dressed from top to toe in golden-yellow clothes.  \"My stars!\" said the wee yellow man. \"How did YOU manage to get in  here? Don't you know this is private?\"    \"I'm very sorry,\" said Neville, \"but I couldn't help it. The Cloud  Horse brought me, you know.\"    \"Ah!\" said the wee yellow man. \"He tricked you, did he? He's much too  playful, that Cloud Horse; and, I must say, he's put you in a pretty  fix.\"    \"Excuse me,\" said Neville, \"but do you mind telling me who you are?\"    \"I?\" cried the little yellow man. \"Why, I'm the Last Sunbeam, of  course. I thought you knew that. My job, you know, is to shut up the  show when the sunset is over. And it's pretty hard work, I can tell  you, because I've got to keep on doing it all round the earth every  few minutes or so. And it gets very tiresome at times. Would you  believe it? I've never seen a dawn or a bright mid-day in all my  life--just sunsets all the time. Sunsets for breakfast, sunsets for  dinner, sunsets for supper. And if I make the tiniest little slip, the  head scene-shifter is down on me like a ton of bricks.\"    \"Goodness me!\" said Neville. \"I didn't know you had scene-shifters  here.\" Neville had been to see pantomimes, and therefore knew what a  scene-shifter was.    \"Then how do you think we shift the scenes?\" cried the wee yellow man  rather crossly. Then he suddenly became very busy about nothing, as he  whispered, \"Look out! Here's the head scene-shifter coming now.\"    Looking back, Neville saw, coming towards them, a man with very large  ears. He was not a nice-looking man, and he was extremely like the  cloud man that Neville had sometimes seen in the sky when he went to  look at the sunset from the bald hill.    \"Now then!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],[0,"Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#5)"],[1,"leave.  Poor Teddy died the next day.  Admiral Dewey stood the  battle better than his unfortunate friend, but he too was pecked at in  a way so threatening that the groceryman concluded it would be wise to  get rid of him immediately.  Because the admiral had not defended  himself better from his pet's attack, the grocer regarded him with some  disgust.    \"Being as there was two of you and only one of the sparrow, 'pears as  if you hadn't much grit,\" he said.  \"I would better take your  high-soundin' name away from you and call you something else besides  Dewey, if you can't fight.\"    For all the man's censure, the redbird knew that if Teddy Roosevelt had  killed the sparrow instead of being killed by it, the grocer would have  been much more grieved at the loss, for he had heard him say the  sparrow was like one of his family.  The man forgot that the result  might have been different if the redbirds had been older.    Having decided to dispose of the admiral, the grocer, who had an errand  in the city the next day, carried the bird with him.  He knew of a  probable customer for it in a gentleman named Morris, who had been  advertising in the papers for a redbird.  He soon found the street and  number where was located the gentleman's office, at which the  advertisement was to be answered, and displayed the admiral.    \"Your bird looks kind of ragged, as though he hadn't been treated  well,\" said Mr. Morris, as he examined the scarlet plumage.  \"My boy  wants a redbird, and I promised him one if he would get the highest  grade in arithmetic in his class this term and he did it, so of course  I must keep my word.  What d'ye ask for this bird?\"    \"He'd be cheap at five dollars,\" answered the groceryman.  \"A nice  redbird is hard to get, and they're powerful nice singers, but bein' as  it's for your boy that has earned it by studying his lessons so good--I  always like a boy that is fond of his books--you can have it for two  dollars and a quarter.\"    As he had paid but five cents for it this advance in price would be a  fine business speculation.  After a little further talk, Mr. Morris  counted out the money, and the man went back to his home doubtless  wishing he had a hundred more redbirds to sell at the same handsome  profit.  After he had gone, Mr. Morris went to a box hanging against  the wall, and turning a handle began talking to the box as if it were a  human being.  Though it was just a plain wooden box, the admiral said  there was something mysterious about it, for Mr. Morris actually seemed  to be carrying on a conversation with it, though the bird could not  hear what the box answered, but he felt sure it talked back.    Mr. Morris' residence was a fine stone house with wide porches and  sunny bay windows, over which were trained graceful creeping vines.  A  boy of about eleven years of age and a very pretty lady stood arm in  arm on the broad steps leading up to the front entrance that evening  when Mr. Morris and the admiral arrived.  They were Johnny Morris and  his mother, who had already learned that Mr. Morris had bought the bird  and would bring it when he came to dinner.  The admiral discovered the  next day that Mrs. Morris owned a box like the one at the office, into  which she talked, and that it was called a telephone.  He often  mentioned this mysterious box as one of the most remarkable things he  saw during his stay among men.    Johnny Morris capered and danced and jumped so hard in the exuberance  of his joy at receiving the redbird that all the way to the sitting  room his mother was coaxing him to be quiet.    \"Don't act so foolishly,\" she begged; but he only capered and kicked up  his heels still harder.  When the cage was placed on a stand in the bay  window he pranced around it, whistled and chirped, threw the bottom of  the cage floor full of seed and splashed the water about so recklessly  in his attempts to be friendly as nearly to frighten the poor admiral  to pieces.    \"Now, Johnny, don't,\" pleaded his mother.    \"Johnny, don't do that,\" commanded his father every few minutes.    It was a constant \"Don't, Johnny, do this\" and \"Don't, Johnny, do  that,\" until, the admiral said, the conversation was so mixed up with  \"Don't-Johnny's\" as made it almost unintelligible.  Of course these  expostulations made not a bit of impression on Johnny Morris.  To be  sure, he might stop for the moment, but the next second he was doing  something else which brought a fresh round of \"Don't-Johnny's\" from  each parent.    He was such a generous, affectionate, pretty boy, with his rosy cheeks  and wavy yellow hair, it was a great pity that he should keep a whole  household in a state of constant commotion by his habit of not promptly  minding when he was spoken to.  His father and mother were very  indulgent to him, and the admiral believed he had every kind of a toy  known to the boy world.  He also had a machine to ride on, which they  called a \"wheel.\"  On this he went out occasionally, although Mrs.  Morris declared she never felt at ease a minute while he was gone,  because he never came back at the hour he promised he would.  Besides  this, he had a dear little pony, named Jock, on whose back he often  cantered about the big park.  Frequently from the bay window the  admiral watched him as he mounted Jock and rode away, while his mother  stood on the house step and called after him as long as he was in  sight: \"Don't ride in that reckless way, Johnny; you'll tumble off,\" or  \"Don't, Johnny; the pony will throw you,\" at which Johnny would laugh  and make the pony go faster.    Among the boy's other possessions was a parrot, which the admiral  asserted was the smartest bird in the world.  She was a highly educated  parrot, and much time had been spent on her training, and she was  usually very willing to show off to company all her various  accomplishments.  Occasionally she assumed an air of offended dignity  when asked to display her talents, and no amount of threats or coaxing  could change her purpose.  At such times she impatiently flapped her  wings and croaked \"No, no\" in her harshest tones.    Her favorite retreat when her temper was ruffled was on the back of an  armchair, where she would sit with her bill in the air and her head  cocked disdainfully on one side, pretending not to hear or see any one.  In her affable moods, however, no one could be more complaisant and  entertaining than Bessie.    Her name was an uncommon one for a parrot.  Strangers usually accosted  her as Polly, at which mistake she was greatly displeased.    \"No, no--not Polly; call me Bessie,\" she would scream, so angrily that  it always made people laugh, which angered her still more.    Bessie could sing a verse of an old-time song, at least she thought she  could.  The admiral said nothing could have induced him to sing for  company if his voice had been as harsh and cracked as hers, but he said  it was a fact that everybody seemed to enjoy her noise more than his  music; that when she took up her position on top of the piano to sing,  they crowded around and called her \"nice Bessie,\" \"nice lady,\" and  praised her, and gave her bits of sugar, as if she were the finest  singer in the world.  The admiral thought they showed very poor taste,  for her music was simply horrid and couldn't compare with the warblings  of the woods birds.  It is well, however, to make allowance for the  admiral's opinion, for musicians are proverbially jealous of each other.    The song the parrot sang was \"Listen to the Mocking Bird,\" to which  Mrs. Morris played a little gliding accompaniment on the piano.  Great  hand-clappings always followed the performance.  These Bessie accepted  with an air of studied indifference.  But if for the purpose of teasing  her they did not applaud her performance, she shrilly screamed:  \"Bessie's a good bird, a good bird I tell you,\" raising her voice  higher and higher at each repetition.    Then she would wait a moment for some one to assure her that she was  indeed a very good bird, quite the smartest bird that ever breathed.  But if these soothing assurances were not quickly forthcoming, she  would retire to the back of her favorite chair and, elevating her bill  to show her disdain, sulk in silence.    \"Did she like you?\" I asked the admiral one day when he was telling us  about her funny tricks.    \"No, she was a little bit jealous of me; yet she was not unfriendly,  except when Johnny or some other member of the family paid me  attention.  She always wanted to be the center of attraction herself,  which showed she was a vain creature.  No matter how silent she had  been or how firmly she might have refused to talk only the minute  before, if Johnny came to my cage and called, 'Hello, Admiral! you're a  daisy,' Bessie immediately struck up such a chattering as would almost  deafen one.    \"'Johnny dear, open my cage.  I want to take a walk,' she would say in  her most coaxing manner.  If she happened to be already out of her cage  and walking about the room, she endeavored to get him to leave me by  saying: 'Here, Johnny, boy, put me on your finger.  Kiss poor  Bessie--p-o-o-r Bessie.'    \"Mrs. Morris used to laugh at these schemes of the parrot to attract  notice, and said Bessie reminded her of some people she had met who  always wanted to monopolize the conversation.\"    \"Monopolize?\" said I.  \"That's a large word.  I don't know the meaning  of it.\"    \"Well, I think it means getting the most of anything and crowding other  people out,\" replied the admiral; \"and it was true in Bessie's case,  for she always wanted the most attention.  A gentleman friend of the  Morrises had this habit too.  He had been a general in a war that took  place in the South a good many years ago, and was often entertained at  dinner at the Morrises'.  Though he was a well-informed, genial man, he  was almost rude in making himself heard, so determined was he that  people should listen to his"]]]
