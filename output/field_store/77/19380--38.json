Artificial fires were indeed frequently used by them, but not in public  rejoicings; like us, they employed them for military purposes; but we  use them likewise successfully for our decorations and amusement.    From the latest times of paganism to the early ages of Christianity, we  can but rarely quote instances of fire lighted up for other purposes, in  a public form, than for the ceremonies of religion; illuminations were  made at the baptism of princes, as a symbol of that life of light in  which they were going to enter by faith; or at the tombs of martyrs, to  light them during the watchings of the night. All these were abolished,  from the various abuses they introduced.    We only trace the rise of _feux-de-joie_, or fireworks, given merely for  amusing spectacles to delight the eye, to the epocha of the invention of  powder and cannon, at the close of the thirteenth century. It was these  two inventions, doubtless, whose effects furnished the ideas of all  those machines and artifices which form the charms of these fires.    To the Florentines and the Siennese are we indebted not only for the  preparation of powder with other ingredients to amuse the eyes, but also  for the invention of elevated machines and decorations adapted to  augment the pleasure of the spectacle. They began their attempts at the  feasts of Saint John the Baptist and the Assumption, on wooden edifices,  which they adorned with painted statues, from whose mouth and eyes  issued a beautiful fire. Callot has engraven numerous specimens of the  pageants, triumphs, and processions, under a great variety of grotesque  forms:--dragons, swans, eagles, &c., which were built up large enough to  carry many persons, while they vomited forth the most amusing firework.    This use passed from Florence to Rome, where, at the creation of the  popes, they displayed illuminations of hand-grenadoes, thrown from the  height of a castle. _Pyrotechnics_ from that time have become an art,  which, in the degree the inventors have displayed ability in combining  the powers of architecture, sculpture, and painting, have produced a  number of beautiful effects, which even give pleasure to those who read  the descriptions without having beheld them.[6]    A pleasing account of decorated fireworks is given in the Secret Memoirs  of France. In August, 1764, Torre, an Italian artist, obtained  permission to exhibit a pyrotechnic operation.--The Parisians admired  the variety of the colours, and the ingenious forms of his fire. But his  first exhibition was disturbed by the populace, as well as by the  apparent danger of the fire, although it was displayed on the  Boulevards. In October it was repeated; and proper precautions having  been taken, they admired the beauty of the fire, without fearing it.  These artificial fires are described as having been rapidly and  splendidly executed. The exhibition closed with a transparent triumphal  arch, and a curtain illuminated by the same fire, admirably exhibiting  the palace of Pluto. Around the columns, stanzas were inscribed,  supported by Cupids, with other fanciful embellishments. Among these  little pieces of poetry appeared the following one, which ingeniously  announced a more perfect exhibition:        Les vents, les frimats, les orages,        Eteindront ces FEUX, pour un tems;      Mais, ainsi que les FLEURS, avec plus d'avautage,        Ils renaitront dans le printems.                     IMITATED.        The icy gale, the falling snow,        Extinction to these FIRES shall bring;      But, like the FLOWERS, with brighter glow,        They shall renew their charms in spring.    The exhibition was greatly improved, according to this promise of the  artist. His subject was chosen with much felicity; it was a  representation of the forges of Vulcan under Mount AEtna. The interior of  the mount discovered Vulcan and his Cyclops. Venus was seen to descend,  and demand of her consort armour for AEneas. Opposite to this was seen  the palace of Vulcan, which presented a deep and brilliant perspective.  The labours of the Cyclops produced numberless very happy combinations  of artificial fires. The public with pleasing astonishment beheld the  effects of the volcano, so admirably adapted to the nature of these  fires. At another entertainment he gratified the public with a  representation of Orpheus and Eurydice in hell; many striking  circumstances occasioned a marvellous illusion. What subjects indeed  could be more analogous to this kind of fire? Such scenical fireworks  display more brilliant effects than our stars, wheels, and rockets.          THE BIBLE PROHIBITED AND IMPROVED.      The following are the _express words_ contained in the regulation of the  popes to prohibit the use of the _Bible_.    \"As it is manifest, by _experience_, that if the use of the holy writers  is permitted in the vulgar tongue more evil than profit will arise,  _because_ of the temerity of man; it is for this reason all Bibles are  prohibited (_prohibentur Biblia_) with all their _parts_, whether they  be printed or written, in whatever vulgar language soever; as also are  prohibited all summaries or abridgments of Bibles, or any books of the  holy writings, although they should only be historical, and that in  whatever Vulgar tongue they may be written.\"    It is there also said, \"That the reading the Bibles of _catholic  editors_ may be permitted to those by whose perusal or power the _faith_  may be spread, and who will not _criticise_ it. But this _permission_ is  not to be granted without an express _order_ of the _bishop_, or the  _inquisitor_, with the _advice_ of the _curate_ and _confessor_; and  their permission must first be had in _writing_. And he who, without  permission, presumes to _read_ the holy writings, or to have them in his  _possession_, shall not be _absolved_ of his sins before he first shall  have returned the Bible to his bishop.\"    A Spanish author says, that if a person should come to his bishop to ask  for leave to _read_ the _Bible_, with the best intention, the bishop  should answer him from Matthew, ch. xx. ver. 20, \"_You know not what you  ask_.\" And indeed, he observes, the nature of this demand indicates an  _heretical disposition_.    The reading of the Bible was prohibited by Henry VIII., except by those  who occupied high offices in the state; a noble lady or gentlewoman  might read it in \"their garden or orchard,\" or other retired places; but  men and women in the lower ranks were positively forbidden to read it,  or to have it read to them, under the penalty of a month's imprisonment.    Dr. Franklin has preserved an anecdote of the prohibited Bible in the  time of our Catholic Mary. His family had an English Bible; and to  conceal it the more securely, they conceived the project of fastening it  open with packthreads across the leaves, on the inside of the lid of a  close-stool! \"When my great-grandfather wished to read to his family, he  reversed the lid of the close-stool upon his knees, and passed the  leaves from one side to the other, which were held down on each by the  packthread. One of the children was stationed at the door to give notice  if he saw an officer of the Spiritual Court make his appearance; in that  case the lid was restored to its place, with the Bible concealed under  it as before.\"    The reader may meditate on what the _popes did_, and what they probably  would _have done_, had not Luther happily been in a humour to abuse the  pope, and begin a REFORMATION. It would be curious to sketch an account  of the _probable_ situation of _Europe_ at the present moment, had the  pontiffs preserved the omnipotent power of which they had gradually  possessed themselves.    It appears, by an act dated in 1516, that the Bible was called  _Bibliotheca_, that is _per emphasim, the Library_. The word library was  limited in its signification then to the biblical writings; no other  books, compared with the holy writings, appear to have been worthy to  rank with them, or constitute what we call a library.    We have had several remarkable attempts to recompose the Bible; Dr.  Geddes's version is aridly literal, and often ludicrous by its  vulgarity; as when he translates the _Passover_ as the _Skipover_, and  introduces _Constables_ among the ancient Israelites; but the following  attempts are of a very different kind. Sebastian _Castillon_--who  afterwards changed his name to _Castalion_, with his accustomed  affectation referring to _Castalia_, the fountain of the Muses--took a  very extraordinary liberty with the sacred writings. He fancied he could  give the world a more classical version of the Bible, and for this  purpose introduces phrases and entire sentences from profane writers  into the text of holy writ. His whole style is finically quaint,  overloaded with prettinesses, and all the ornaments of false taste. Of  the noble simplicity of the Scripture he seems not to have had the  remotest conception.    But an attempt by Pere Berruyer is more extraordinary; in his _Histoire  du Peuple de Dieu_, he has recomposed the Bible as he would have written  a fashionable novel. He conceives that the great legislator of the  Hebrews is too barren in his descriptions, too concise in the events he  records, nor is he careful to enrich his history by pleasing reflections  and interesting conversation pieces, and hurries on the catastrophes, by  which means he omits much entertaining matter: as for instance, in the  loves of Joseph and the wife of Potiphar, Moses is very dry and concise,  which, however, our Pere Berruyer is not. His histories of Joseph, and  of King David, are relishing morsels, and were devoured eagerly in all  the boudoirs of Paris. Take a specimen of the style. \"Joseph combined,  with a regularity of features and a brilliant complexion, an air of the  noblest dignity; all which contributed to render him one of the most  amiable men in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#5)"],[1," but even then the inflection is almost  always downward; in other words, we pitch our voices higher and  let them fall slightly. For instance, if we heard a person cry  \"Ah/\" we might doubt its being a cry of pain, but if it were  \"Ah\\\" we should at once know that it was caused by pain,  either mental or physical.    The declamation at the end of Schubert's \"Erlking\" would have  been absolutely false if the penultimate note had ascended to  the tonic instead of descending a fifth. \"The child lay dead.\"    How fatally hopeless would be the opening measures of \"Tristan  and Isolde\" without that upward inflection which comes like a  sunbeam through a rift in the cloud; with a downward inflection  the effect would be that of unrelieved gloom. In the Prelude to  \"Lohengrin,\" Wagner pictures his angels in dazzling white. He  uses the highest vibrating sounds at his command. But for  the dwarfs who live in the gloom of Niebelheim he chooses  deep shades of red, the lowest vibrating colour of the solar  spectrum. For it is in the nature of the spiritual part  of mankind to shrink from the earth, to aspire to something  higher; a bird soaring in the blue above us has something of  the ethereal; we give wings to our angels. On the other hand,  a serpent impresses us as something sinister. Trees, with  their strange fight against all the laws of gravity, striving  upward unceasingly, bring us something of hope and faith; the  sight of them cheers us. A land without trees is depressing and  gloomy. As Ruskin says, \"The sea wave, with all its beneficence,  is yet devouring and terrible; but the silent wave of the blue  mountain is lifted towards Heaven in a stillness of perpetual  mercy; and while the one surges unfathomable in its darkness,  the other is unshaken in its faithfulness.\"    And yet so strange is human nature that that which we  call civilization strives unceasingly to nullify emotion.  The almost childlike faith which made our church spires  point heavenward also gave us Gothic architecture, that  emblem of frail humanity striving towards the ideal. It is  a long leap from that childlike faith to the present day of  skyscrapers. For so is the world constituted. A great truth  too often becomes gradually a truism, then a merely tolerated  and uninteresting theory; gradually it becomes obsolete  and sometimes even degenerates into a symbol of sarcasm or a  servant of utilitarianism. This we are illustrating every day  of our lives. We speak of a person's being \"silly,\" and yet  the word comes from \"saelig,\" old English for \"blessed\"; to act  \"sheepishly\" once had reference to divine resignation, \"even  as a sheep led to the slaughter,\" and so on _ad infinitum_.  We build but few great cathedrals now. Our tall buildings  generally point to utilitarianism and the almighty dollar.    But in the new art, music, we have found a new domain in which  impulses have retained their freshness and warmth, in which,  to quote Goethe, \"first comes the act, then the word\"; first  the expression of emotion, then the theory that classifies it;  a domain in which words cannot lose their original meanings  entirely, as in speech. For in spite of the strange twistings  of ultra modern music, a simple melody still embodies the  same pathos for us that it did for our grandparents. To be  sure the poignancy of harmony in our day has been heightened  to an incredible degree. We deal in gorgeous colouring and  mighty sound masses which would have been amazing in the last  century; but still through it all we find in Haendel, Beethoven,  and Schubert, up to Wagner, the same great truths of declamation  that I have tried to explain to you.    Herbert Spencer, in an essay on \"The Origin and Functions of  Music,\" speaks of speech as the parent of music. He says,  \"utterance, which when languaged is speech, gave rise to  music.\" The definition is incomplete, for \"languaged utterance,\"  as he calls it, which is speech, is a duality, is either an  expression of emotion or a mere symbol of emotion, and as such  has gradually sunk to the level of the commonplace. As Rowbotham  points out, impassioned speech is the parent of music, while  unimpassioned speech has remained the vehicle for the smaller  emotions of life, the everyday expression of everyday emotions.    In studying the music of different nations we are confronted  by one fact which seems to be part and parcel of almost every  nationality, namely, the constant recurrence of what is called  the five tone (pentatonic) scale. We find it in primitive  forms of music all the world over, in China and in Scotland,  among the Burmese, and again in North America. Why it is so  seems almost doomed to remain a mystery. The following theory  may nevertheless be advanced as being at least plausible:    Vocal music, as we understand it, and as I have already  explained, began when the first tone could be given clearly;  that is to say, when the sound sentence had amalgamated into the  single musical tone. The pitch being sometimes F, sometimes G,  sudden emotion gives us the fifth, C or D, and the strongest  emotion the octave, F or G. Thus we have already the following  sounds in our first musical scale.        [G: f' g' c'' d'' f'']    We know how singers slur from one tone to another. It is a  fault that caused the fathers of harmony to prohibit what  are called hidden fifths in vocal music. The jump from G to  C in the above scale fragment would be slurred, for we must  remember that the intoning of clear individual sounds was  still a novelty to the savage. Now the distance from G to  C is too small to admit two tones such as the savage knew;  consequently, for the sake of uniformity, he would try to  put but one tone between, singing a mixture of A and B[flat],  which sound in time fell definitely to A, leaving the mystery  of the half-tone unsolved. This addition of the third would  thus fall in with the law of harmonics again. First we have the  keynote; next in importance comes the fifth; and last of all  the third. Thus again is the absence of the major seventh in  our primitive scale perfectly logical; we may search in vain  in our list of harmonics for the tone which forms that interval.    Now that we have traced the influence of passionate utterance  on music, it still remains for us to consider the influence  of something very different. The dance played an important  role in the shaping of the art of music; for to it music owes  periodicity, form, the shaping of phrases into measures,  even its rests. And in this music is not the only debtor,  for poetry owes its very \"feet\" to the dance.    Now the dance was, and is, an irresponsible thing. It had no  _raison d'etre_ except purely physical enjoyment. This rhythmic  swaying of the body and light tapping of the feet have always  had a mysterious attraction and fascination for mankind,  and music and poetry were caught in its swaying measures  early in the dawn of art. When a man walks, he takes either  long steps or short steps, he walks fast or slow. But when  he takes one long step and one short one, when one step is  slow and the other fast, he no longer walks, he dances. Thus  we may say with reasonable certainty that triple time arose  directly from the dance, for triple time is simply one strong,  long beat followed by a short, light one, viz.: [2 4] or  [- '], the \"trochee\" in our poetry. [4 2] [' -], Iambic.  The spondee [2 2] or [- -], which is the rhythm of prose,  we already possessed; for when we walk it is in spondees,  namely, in groups of two equal steps. Now imagine dancing  to spondees! At first the steps will be equal, but the body  rests on the first beat; little by little the second beat,  being thus relegated to a position of relative unimportance,  becomes shorter and shorter, and we rest longer on the first  beat. The result is the trochaic rhythm. We can see that this  result is inevitable, even if only the question of physical  fatigue is considered. And, to carry on our theory, this very  question of fatigue still further develops rhythm. The strong  beat always coming on one foot, and the light beat on the other,  would soon tire the dancer; therefore some way must be found  to make the strong beat alternate from one foot to the other.  The simplest, and in fact almost the only way to do this,  is to insert an additional short beat before the light beat.  This gives us [- ' -] or [4. 8 4], the dactyl in poetry.    We have, moreover, here discovered the beginning of form, and  have begun to group our musical tones in measures and phrases;  for our second dactyl is slightly different from the first,  because the right foot begins the first and the left foot the  second. We have two measures [(4. 8 4 | 4. 8 4)]                               [(-  ' - | -  ' -)]  and one phrase, for after the second measure the right foot  will again have the beat and will begin another phrase of two  measures.    Carry this theory still further, and we shall make new  discoveries. If we dance in the open air, unless we would dance  over the horizon, we must turn somewhere; and if we have but a  small space in which to dance, the turns must come sooner and  oftener. Even if we danced in a circle we should need to reverse  the motion occasionally, in order to avoid giddiness; and this  would measure off our phrases into periods and sections.    Thus we see music dividing into two classes, one purely  emotional, the other sensuous; the one arising from the language  of heroes, the other from the swaying of the body and the patter  of feet. To both of these elements, if we may call them so,  metre and melody brought their power; to declamation, metre  brought its potent vitality; to the dance, melody added its soft  charm and lulling rhyme. The intellectual in music, namely,  rhythm and declamation, thus joined forces, as did the purely  sensuous elements, melody and metre (dance). At the first glance  it would seem as if the"]]]
