The second Taraz is to consort with the followers of all religions in a  spirit of friendliness and fellowship, to proclaim that which the Speaker  on Sinai hath set forth and to observe fairness in all matters.    They that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness should associate with  all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance, inasmuch  as consorting with people hath promoted and will continue to promote unity  and concord, which in turn are conducive to the maintenance of order in  the world and to the regeneration of nations. Blessed are such as hold  fast to the cord of kindliness and tender mercy and are free from  animosity and hatred.    This Wronged One exhorteth the peoples of the world to observe tolerance  and righteousness, which are two lights amidst the darkness of the world  and two educators for the edification of mankind. Happy are they who have  attained thereto and woe betide the heedless.    The third Taraz concerneth good character. A good character is, verily,  the best mantle for men from God. With it He adorneth the temples of His  loved ones. By My life! The light of a good character surpasseth the light  of the sun and the radiance thereof. Whoso attaineth unto it is accounted  as a jewel among men. The glory and the upliftment of the world must needs  depend upon it. A goodly character is a means whereby men are guided to  the Straight Path and are led to the Great Announcement. Well is it with  him who is adorned with the saintly attributes and character of the  Concourse on High.    It beseemeth you to fix your gaze under all conditions upon justice and  fairness. In The Hidden Words this exalted utterance hath been revealed  from Our Most August Pen:    'O Son of Spirit! The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice;  turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may  confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not  through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not  through the knowledge of thy neighbour. Ponder this in thy heart; how it  behoveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift to thee and the sign of My  loving-kindness. Set it then before thine eyes.'    They that are just and fair-minded in their judgement occupy a sublime  station and hold an exalted rank. The light of piety and uprightness  shineth resplendent from these souls. We earnestly hope that the peoples  and countries of the world may not be deprived of the splendours of these  two luminaries.    The fourth Taraz concerneth trustworthiness. Verily it is the door of  security for all that dwell on earth and a token of glory on the part of  the All-Merciful. He who partaketh thereof hath indeed partaken of the  treasures of wealth and prosperity. Trustworthiness is the greatest portal  leading unto the tranquillity and security of the people. In truth the  stability of every affair hath depended and doth depend upon it. All the  domains of power, of grandeur and of wealth are illumined by its light.    Not long ago these sublime words were revealed from the Pen of the Most  High:    'We will now mention unto thee Trustworthiness and the station thereof in  the estimation of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. One day of  days We repaired unto Our Green Island. Upon Our arrival, We beheld its  streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant, and the sunlight playing in  their midst. Turning Our face to the right, We beheld what the pen is  powerless to describe; nor can it set forth that which the eye of the Lord  of Mankind witnessed in that most sanctified, that most sublime, that  blest, and most exalted Spot. Turning, then, to the left We gazed on one  of the Beauties of the Most Sublime Paradise, standing on a pillar of  light, and calling aloud saying: \"O inmates of earth and heaven! Behold ye  My beauty, and My radiance, and My revelation, and My effulgence. By God,  the True One! I am Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof, and the  beauty thereof. I will recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and  recognize My rank and station, and hold fast unto My hem. I am the most  great ornament of the people of Baha, and the vesture of glory unto all  who are in the kingdom of creation. I am the supreme instrument for the  prosperity of the world, and the horizon of assurance unto all beings.\"  Thus have We sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto the  Lord of creation.'    O people of Baha! Trustworthiness is in truth the best of vestures for  your temples and the most glorious crown for your heads. Take ye fast hold  of it at the behest of Him Who is the Ordainer, the All-Informed.    The fifth Taraz concerneth the protection and preservation of the stations  of God's servants. One should not ignore the truth of any matter, rather  should one give expression to that which is right and true. The people of  Baha should not deny any soul the reward due to him, should treat  craftsmen with deference, and, unlike the people aforetime, should not  defile their tongues with abuse.    In this Day the sun of craftsmanship shineth above the horizon of the  occident and the river of arts is flowing out of the sea of that region.  One must speak with fairness and appreciate such bounty. By the life of  God! The word 'Equity' shineth bright and resplendent even as the sun. We  pray God to graciously shed its radiance upon everyone. He is in truth  powerful over all things, He Who is wont to answer the prayers of all men.    In these days truthfulness and sincerity are sorely afflicted in the  clutches of falsehood, and justice is tormented by the scourge of  injustice. The smoke of corruption hath enveloped the whole world in such  wise that naught can be seen in any direction save regiments of soldiers  and nothing is heard from any land but the clashing of swords. We beseech  God, the True One, to strengthen the wielders of His power in that which  will rehabilitate the world and bring tranquillity to the nations.    The sixth Taraz    Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God. It is incumbent upon  everyone to acquire it. Such arts and material means as are now manifest  have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge and wisdom which have been  revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His Most Exalted Pen--a Pen out of  whose treasury pearls of wisdom and utterance and the arts and crafts of  the world are brought to light.    In this Day the secrets of the earth are laid bare before the eyes of men.  The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the  world. They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples and  kindreds. They both reflect them and make them known. They are a mirror  endowed with hearing, sight and speech. This is an amazing and potent  phenomenon. However, it behoveth the writers thereof to be purged from the  promptings of evil passions and desires and to be attired with the raiment  of justice and equity. They should enquire into situations as much as  possible and ascertain the facts, then set them down in writing.    Concerning this Wronged One, most of the things reported in the newspapers  are devoid of truth. Fair speech and truthfulness, by reason of their  lofty rank and position, are regarded as a sun shining above the horizon  of knowledge. The waves rising from this Ocean are apparent before the  eyes of the peoples of the world and the effusions of the Pen of wisdom  and utterance are manifest everywhere.    It is reported in the press that this Servant hath fled from the land of  Ta (Tihran) and gone to 'Iraq. Gracious God! Not even for a single moment  hath this Wronged One ever concealed Himself. Rather hath He at all times  remained steadfast and conspicuous before the eyes of all men. Never have  We retreated, nor shall We ever seek flight. In truth it is the foolish  people who flee from Our presence. We left Our home country accompanied by  two mounted escorts, representing the two honoured governments of Persia  and Russia until We arrived in 'Iraq in the plenitude of glory and power.  Praise be to God! The Cause whereof this Wronged One is the Bearer  standeth as high as heaven and shineth resplendent as the sun. Concealment  hath no access unto this station, nor is there any occasion for fear or  silence.    The mysteries of Resurrection and the events of the Last Hour are openly  manifest, but the people are sunk in heedlessness and have suffered  themselves to be wrapt in veils. 'And when the seas shall boil... And when  the Scriptures shall be unrolled.'(5) By the righteousness of God! The  Dawn hath truly brightened and the light hath shone forth and the night  hath receded. Happy are they that comprehend. Happy are they that have  attained thereunto.    Glorified be God! The Pen is perplexed what to write and the Tongue  wondereth what to utter. Despite unprecedented hardships and after  enduring years of imprisonment, captivity and woeful trials, We now  perceive that veils thicker than the ones We have already torn asunder  have intervened, obstructing the vision and causing the light of  understanding to be obscured. Moreover We observe that the fresh calumnies  which are now rife are far more malicious than those of former days.    O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the merciful Lord. Consider the people of  former times. What were their deeds and what fruit did they gather? Every  thing they uttered was but imposture and whatever they wrought hath proved  worthless, except for those whom God hath graciously protected through His  power.    I swear by the life of Him Who is the Desire of the world! Were a man to  ponder in his heart he would, free of all attachment to the world, hasten  unto the Most Great Light and would purge and purify himself from the dust  of vain imaginings and the smoke of idle fancy.

The growling was the heavy regular  breathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still  asleep. The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face from the wet  corner of a bath-towel out of which her brother Robert was gently  squeezing the water, to wake her up, as he now explained.    \"Oh, drop it!\" she said rather crossly; so he did, for he was not a  brutal brother, though very ingenious in apple-pie beds, booby-traps,  original methods of awakening sleeping relatives, and the other  little accomplishments which make home happy.    [Illustration: The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face]    \"I had such a funny dream,\" Anthea began.    \"So did I,\" said Jane, wakening suddenly and without warning. \"I dreamed  we found a Sand-fairy in the gravel-pits, and it said it was a Sammyadd,  and we might have a new wish every day, and\"----    \"But that's what _I_ dreamed,\" said Robert; \"I was just going to tell  you,--and we had the first wish directly it said so. And I dreamed you  girls were donkeys enough to ask for us all to be beautiful as day, and  we jolly well were, and it was perfectly beastly.\"    \"But _can_ different people all dream the same thing?\" said Anthea,  sitting up in bed, \"because I dreamed all that as well as about the Zoo  and the rain; and Baby didn't know us in my dream, and the servants shut  us out of the house because the radiantness of our beauty was such a  complete disguise, and\"----    The voice of the eldest brother sounded from across the landing.    \"Come on, Robert,\" it said, \"you'll be late for breakfast again--unless  you mean to shirk your bath as you did on Tuesday.\"    \"I say, come here a second,\" Robert replied; \"I didn't shirk it; I had  it after brekker in father's dressing-room because ours was emptied  away.\"    Cyril appeared in the doorway, partially clothed.    \"Look here,\" said Anthea, \"we've all had such an odd dream. We've all  dreamed we found a Sand-fairy.\"    Her voice died away before Cyril's contemptuous glance.    \"Dream?\" he said; \"you little sillies, it's _true_. I tell you it all  happened. That's why I'm so keen on being down early. We'll go up there  directly after brekker, and have another wish. Only we'll make up our  minds, solid, before we go, what it is we do want, and no one must ask  for anything unless the others agree first. No more peerless beauties  for this child, thank you. Not if I know it!\"    The other three dressed, with their mouths open. If all that dream about  the Sand-fairy was real, this real dressing seemed very like a dream,  the girls thought. Jane felt that Cyril was right, but Anthea was not  sure, till after they had seen Martha and heard her full and plain  reminders about their naughty conduct the day before. Then Anthea was  sure.    \"Because,\" said she, \"servants never dream anything but the things in  the Dream-book, like snakes and oysters and going to a wedding--that  means a funeral, and snakes are a false female friend, and oysters are  babies.\"    \"Talking of babies,\" said Cyril, \"where's the Lamb?\"    \"Martha's going to take him to Rochester to see her cousins. Mother said  she might. She's dressing him now,\" said Jane, \"in his very best coat  and hat. Bread-and-butter, please.\"    \"She seems to like taking him too,\" said Robert in a tone of wonder.    \"Servants _do_ like taking babies to see their relations,\" Cyril said;  \"I've noticed it before--especially in their best clothes.\"    \"I expect they pretend they're their own babies, and that they're not  servants at all, but married to noble dukes of high degree, and they say  the babies are the little dukes and duchesses,\" Jane suggested dreamily,  taking more marmalade. \"I expect that's what Martha'll say to her  cousin. She'll enjoy herself most frightfully.\"    \"She won't enjoy herself most frightfully carrying our infant duke to  Rochester,\" said Robert; \"not if she's anything like me--she won't.\"    \"Fancy walking to Rochester with the Lamb on your back!\" said Cyril in  full agreement.    \"She's gone by the carrier's cart,\" said Jane. \"Let's see them off, then  we shall have done a polite and kindly act, and we shall be quite sure  we've got rid of them for the day.\"    So they did.    Martha wore her Sunday dress of two shades of purple, so tight in the  chest that it made her stoop, and her blue hat with the pink  cornflowers and white ribbon. She had a yellow-lace collar with a green  bow. And the Lamb had indeed his very best cream-colored silk coat and  hat. It was a smart party that the carrier's cart picked up at the Cross  Roads. When its white tilt and red wheels had slowly vanished in a swirl  of chalk-dust--    \"And now for the Sammyadd!\" said Cyril, and off they went.    As they went they decided on the wish they would ask for. Although they  were all in a great hurry they did not try to climb down the sides of  the gravel-pit, but went round by the safe lower road, as if they had  been carts.    They had made a ring of stones round the place where the Sand-fairy had  disappeared, so they easily found the spot. The sun was burning and  bright, and the sky was deep blue--without a cloud. The sand was very  hot to touch.    \"Oh--suppose it was only a dream, after all,\" Robert said as the boys  uncovered their spades from the sand-heap where they had buried them  and began to dig.    \"Suppose you were a sensible chap,\" said Cyril; \"one's quite as likely  as the other!\"    \"Suppose you kept a civil tongue in your head,\" Robert snapped.    \"Suppose we girls take a turn,\" said Jane, laughing. \"You boys seem to  be getting very warm.\"    \"Suppose you don't come putting your silly oar in,\" said Robert, who was  now warm indeed.    \"We won't,\" said Anthea quickly. \"Robert dear, don't be so grumpy--we  won't say a word, you shall be the one to speak to the Fairy and tell  him what we've decided to wish for. You'll say it much better than we  shall.\"    \"Suppose you drop being a little humbug,\" said Robert, but not crossly.  \"Look out--dig with your hands, now!\"    So they did, and presently uncovered the spider-shaped brown hairy body,  long arms and legs, bat's ears and snail's eyes of the Sand-fairy  himself. Everyone drew a deep breath of satisfaction, for now of course  it couldn't have been a dream.    The Psammead sat up and shook the sand out of its fur.    \"How's your left whisker this morning?\" said Anthea politely.    \"Nothing to boast of,\" said it; \"it had rather a restless night. But  thank you for asking.\"    \"I say,\" said Robert, \"do you feel up to giving wishes to-day, because  we very much want an extra besides the regular one? The extra's a very  little one,\" he added reassuringly.    \"Humph!\" said the Sand-fairy. (If you read this story aloud, please  pronounce \"humph\" exactly as it is spelt, for that is how he said it.)  \"Humph! Do you know, until I heard you being disagreeable to each other  just over my head, and so loud too, I really quite thought I had dreamed  you all. I do have very odd dreams sometimes.\"    \"Do you?\" Jane hurried to say, so as to get away from the subject of  disagreeableness. \"I wish,\" she added politely, \"you'd tell us about  your dreams--they must be awfully interesting\"--    \"Is that the day's wish?\" said the Sand-fairy, yawning.    Cyril muttered something about \"just like a girl,\" and the rest stood  silent. If they said \"Yes,\" then good-bye to the other wishes they had  decided to ask for. If they said \"No,\" it would be very rude, and they  had all been taught manners, and had learned a little too, which is not  at all the same thing. A sigh of relief broke from all lips when the  Sand-fairy said--    \"If I do, I shan't have strength to give you a second wish; not even  good tempers, or common-sense, or manners, or little things like that.\"    \"We don't want you to put yourself out at all about _these_ things, we  can manage them quite well ourselves,\" said Cyril eagerly; while the  others looked guiltily at each other, and wished the Fairy would not  keep all on about good tempers, but give them one good scolding if it  wanted to, and then have done with it.    \"Well,\" said the Psammead, putting out his long snail's eyes so suddenly  that one of them nearly went into the round boy's eye of Robert, \"let's  have the little wish first.\"    \"We don't want the servants to notice the gifts you give us.\"    \"Are kind enough to give us,\" said Anthea in a whisper.    \"Are kind enough to give us, I mean,\" said Robert.    The Fairy swelled himself out a bit, let his breath go, and said--    \"I've done _that_ for you--it was quite easy. People don't notice things  much, anyway. What's the next wish?\"    \"We want,\" said Robert slowly, \"to be rich beyond the dreams of  something or other.\"    \"Avarice,\" said Jane.    \"So it is,\" said the Fairy unexpectedly. \"But it won't do you much good,  that's one comfort,\" it muttered to itself. \"Come--I can't go beyond  dreams, you know! How much do you want, and will you have it in gold or  notes?\"    \"Gold, please--and millions of it\"--    \"This gravel-pit full be enough?\" said the Fairy in an off-hand manner.    \"Oh _yes_\"--    \"Then go out before I begin, or you'll be buried alive in it.\"    It made its skinny arms so long, and waved them so frighteningly, that  the children ran as hard as they could towards the road by which carts  used to come to the gravel-pits. Only Anthea had presence of mind enough  to shout a timid \"Good-morning, I hope your whisker will be better  to-morrow,\" as she ran.    On the road they turned and looked back, and they had to shut their  eyes, and open them very slowly, a little bit at a time, because the  sight was too dazzling for their eyes to be able to bear. It was  something like trying to look at the sun at high noon on Midsummer Day.  For the whole of the sand-pit was full, right up to the very top, with  new shining gold pieces, and all the little bank-martins' little front  doors were"]]]
