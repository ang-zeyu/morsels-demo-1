[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],[0,"The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#5)"],[1," days whereon the Spirit of God (Jesus)  appeared, and Herod gave judgment against Him. God, however, aided Him  with the hosts of the unseen, and protected Him with truth, and sent Him  down unto another land, according to His promise. He, verily, ordaineth  what He pleaseth. Thy Lord truly preserveth whom He willeth, be he in the  midst of the seas, or in the maw of the serpent, or beneath the sword of  the oppressor....    Again I say: Hearken unto My Voice that calleth from My prison that it may  acquaint thee with the things that have befallen My Beauty, at the hands  of them that are the manifestations of My glory, and that thou mayest  perceive how great hath been My patience, notwithstanding My might, and  how immense My forbearance, notwithstanding My power. By My Life! Couldst  thou but know the things sent down by My Pen, and discover the treasures  of My Cause, and the pearls of My mysteries which lie hid in the seas of  My names and in the goblets of My words, thou wouldst, in thy love for My  name, and in thy longing for My glorious and sublime Kingdom, lay down thy  life in My path. Know thou that though My body be beneath the swords of My  foes, and My limbs be beset with incalculable afflictions, yet My spirit  is filled with a gladness with which all the joys of the earth can never  compare.    Set thine heart towards Him Who is the Point of adoration for the world,  and say: O peoples of the earth! Have ye denied the One in Whose path He  Who came with the truth, bearing the announcement of your Lord, the  Exalted, the Great, suffered martyrdom? Say: This is an Announcement  whereat the hearts of the Prophets and Messengers have rejoiced. This is  the One Whom the heart of the world remembereth and is promised in the  Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. The hands of the Messengers were,  in their desire to meet Me, upraised towards God, the Mighty, the  Glorified.... Some lamented in their separation from Me, others endured  hardships in My path, and still others laid down their lives for the sake  of My Beauty, could ye but know it. Say: I, verily, have not sought to  extol Mine Own Self, but rather God Himself were ye to judge fairly.  Naught can be seen in Me except God and His Cause, could ye but perceive  it. I am the One Whom the tongue of Isaiah hath extolled, the One with  Whose name both the Torah and the Evangel were adorned.... Blessed be the  king whose sovereignty hath withheld him not from his Sovereign, and who  hath turned unto God with his heart. He, verily, is accounted of those  that have attained unto that which God, the Mighty, the All-Wise hath  willed. Ere long will such a one find himself numbered with the monarchs  of the realms of the Kingdom. Thy Lord is, in truth, potent over all  things. He giveth what He willeth to whomsoever He willeth, and  withholdeth what He pleaseth from whomsoever He willeth. He, verily, is  the All-Powerful, the Almighty.          QUEEN VICTORIA      O QUEEN in London! Incline thine ear unto the voice of thy Lord, the Lord  of all mankind, calling from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, no God is there  but Me, the Almighty, the All-Wise! Cast away all that is on earth, and  attire the head of thy kingdom with the crown of the remembrance of thy  Lord, the All-Glorious. He, in truth, hath come unto the world in His most  great glory, and all that hath been mentioned in the Gospel hath been  fulfilled. The land of Syria hath been honoured by the footsteps of its  Lord, the Lord of all men, and North and South are both inebriated with  the wine of His presence. Blessed is the man that inhaled the fragrance of  the Most Merciful, and turned unto the Dawning-Place of His Beauty, in  this resplendent Dawn. The Mosque of Aqsa vibrateth through the breezes of  its Lord, the All-Glorious whilst Batha (Mecca) trembleth at the voice of  God, the Exalted, the Most High. Whereupon every single stone of them  celebrateth the praise of the Lord, through this Great Name.    Lay aside thy desire, and set then thine heart towards thy Lord, the  Ancient of Days. We make mention of thee for the sake of God, and desire  that thy name may be exalted through thy remembrance of God, the Creator  of earth and heaven. He, verily, is witness unto that which I say. We have  been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves, both men and  women. This, verily, is what God hath enjoined in this wondrous  Revelation. God hath, truly, destined a reward for thee, because of this.  He, verily, will pay the doer of good his due recompense, wert thou to  follow what hath been sent unto thee by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the  All-Informed. As to him who turneth aside, and swelleth with pride, after  that the clear tokens have come unto him, from the Revealer of signs, his  work shall God bring to naught. He, in truth, hath power over all things.  Man's actions are acceptable after his having recognized (the  Manifestation). He that turneth aside from the True One is indeed the most  veiled amongst His creatures. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the  Almighty, the Most Powerful.    We have also heard that thou hast entrusted the reins of counsel into the  hands of the representatives of the people. Thou, indeed, hast done well,  for thereby the foundations of the edifice of thine affairs will be  strengthened, and the hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow, whether  high or low, will be tranquillized. It behoveth them, however, to be  trustworthy among His servants, and to regard themselves as the  representatives of all that dwell on earth. This is what counselleth them,  in this Tablet, He Who is the Ruler, the All-Wise... Blessed is he that  entereth the assembly for the sake of God, and judgeth between men with  pure justice. He, indeed, is of the blissful....    Turn thou unto God and say: O my Sovereign Lord! I am but a vassal of  Thine, and Thou art, in truth, the King of Kings. I have lifted my  suppliant hands unto the heaven of Thy grace and Thy bounties. Send down,  then, upon me from the clouds of Thy generosity that which will rid me of  all save Thee, and draw me nigh unto Thyself. I beseech Thee, O my Lord,  by Thy name, which Thou hast made the king of names, and the manifestation  of Thyself to all who are in heaven and on earth, to rend asunder the  veils that have intervened between me and my recognition of the  Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Day Spring of Thy Revelation. Thou art,  verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Bounteous. Deprive me not,  O my Lord, of the fragrances of the Robe of Thy mercy in Thy days, and  write down for me that which Thou hast written down for thy handmaidens  who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and have recognized Thee, and  set their hearts towards the horizon of Thy Cause. Thou art truly the Lord  of the worlds and of those who show mercy the Most Merciful. Assist me,  then, O my God, to remember Thee amongst Thy handmaidens, and to aid Thy  Cause in Thy lands. Accept, then, that which hath escaped me when the  light of Thy countenance shone forth. Thou, indeed, hast power over all  things. Glory be to Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of the  heavens and of the earth.          KAISER WILHELM I      O KING of Berlin! Give ear unto the Voice calling from this manifest  Temple: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Everlasting, the  Peerless, the Ancient of Days. Take heed lest pride debar thee from  recognizing the Dayspring of Divine Revelation, lest earthly desires shut  thee out, as by a veil, from the Lord of the Throne above and of the earth  below. Thus counselleth thee the Pen of the Most High. He, verily, is the  Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Do thou remember the one whose power  transcended thy power (Napoleon III), and whose station excelled thy  station. Where is he? Whither are gone the things he possessed? Take  warning, and be not of them that are fast asleep. He it was who cast the  Tablet of God behind him, when We made known unto him what the hosts of  tyranny had caused Us to suffer. Wherefore, disgrace assailed him from all  sides, and he went down to dust in great loss. Think deeply, O King,  concerning him, and concerning them who, like unto thee, have conquered  cities and ruled over men. The All-Merciful brought them down from their  palaces to their graves. Be warned, be of them who reflect... O banks of  the Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of  retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have another turn. And  We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be today in conspicuous  glory.          EMPEROR FRANCIS JOSEPH      O EMPEROR of Austria! He who is the Dayspring of God's Light dwelt in the  prison of Akka, at the time when thou didst set forth to visit the Aqsa  Mosque (Jerusalem). Thou passed Him by, and inquired not about Him, by  Whom every house is exalted, and every lofty gate unlocked. We, verily,  made it (Jerusalem) a place whereunto the world should turn, that they  might remember Me, and yet thou hast rejected Him Who is the Object of  this remembrance, when He appeared with the Kingdom of God, thy Lord and  the Lord of the worlds. We have been with thee at all times, and found  thee clinging unto the Branch and heedless of the Root. Thy Lord, verily,  is a witness unto what I say. We grieved to see thee circle round Our  Name, whilst unaware of Us, though We were before thy face. Open thine  eyes, that thou mayest behold this glorious Vision, and recognize Him Whom  thou invokest in the daytime and in the night-season, and gaze on the  Light that shineth above this luminous Horizon.          SULTAN 'ABDU'L-'AZIZ      HEARKEN, O King, to the speech of Him that speaketh the truth, Him that  doth not ask thee to recompense Him with the things God hath chosen to  bestow upon thee, Him Who unerringly treadeth the straight Path. He it is  Who summoneth thee unto God, thy Lord, Who showeth "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16986"],[0,"The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys (#5)"],[1,"   The tale is still unfinished and I have no heart for it--    Then pray forgive me.(60)    The pen groaneth and the ink sheddeth tears, and the river(61) of the  heart moveth in waves of blood. \"Nothing can befall us but what God hath  destined for us.\"(62) Peace be upon him who followeth the Right Path!    After scaling the high summits of wonderment the wayfarer cometh to          The Valley of True Poverty and Absolute Nothingness      This station is the dying from self and the living in God, the being poor  in self and rich in the Desired One. Poverty as here referred to  signifieth being poor in the things of the created world, rich in the  things of God's world. For when the true lover and devoted friend reacheth  to the presence of the Beloved, the sparkling beauty of the Loved One and  the fire of the lover's heart will kindle a blaze and burn away all veils  and wrappings. Yea, all he hath, from heart to skin, will be set aflame,  so that nothing will remain save the Friend.      When the qualities of the Ancient of Days stood revealed,    Then the qualities of earthly things did Moses burn away.(63)    He who hath attained this station is sanctified from all that pertaineth  to the world. Wherefore, if those who have come to the sea of His presence  are found to possess none of the limited things of this perishable world,  whether it be outer wealth or personal opinions, it mattereth not. For  whatever the creatures have is limited by their own limits, and whatever  the True One hath is sanctified therefrom; this utterance must be deeply  pondered that its purport may be clear. \"Verily the righteous shall drink  of a winecup tempered at the camphor fountain.\"(64) If the interpretation  of \"camphor\" become known, the true intention will be evident. This state  is that poverty of which it is said, \"Poverty is My glory.\"(65) And of  inward and outward poverty there is many a stage and many a meaning which  I have not thought pertinent to mention here; hence I have reserved these  for another time, dependent on what God may desire and fate may seal.    This is the plane whereon the vestiges of all things (Kullu Shay') are  destroyed in the traveler, and on the horizon of eternity the Divine Face  riseth out of the darkness, and the meaning of \"All on the earth shall  pass away, but the face of thy Lord....\"(66) is made manifest.    O My friend, listen with heart and soul to the songs of the spirit, and  treasure them as thine own eyes. For the heavenly wisdoms, like the clouds  of spring, will not rain down on the earth of men's hearts forever; and  though the grace of the All-Bounteous One is never stilled and never  ceasing, yet to each time and era a portion is allotted and a bounty set  apart, this in a given measure. \"And no one thing is there, but with Us  are its storehouses; and We send it not down but in settled measure.\"(67)  The cloud of the Loved One's mercy raineth only on the garden of the  spirit, and bestoweth this bounty only in the season of spring. The other  seasons have no share in this greatest grace, and barren lands no portion  of this favor.    O Brother! Not every sea hath pearls; not every branch will flower, nor  will the nightingale sing thereon. Then, ere the nightingale of the mystic  paradise repair to the garden of God, and the rays of the heavenly morning  return to the Sun of Truth--make thou an effort, that haply in this  dustheap of the mortal world thou mayest catch a fragrance from the  everlasting garden, and live forever in the shadow of the peoples of this  city. And when thou hast attained this highest station and come to this  mightiest plane, then shalt thou gaze on the Beloved, and forget all else.      The Beloved shineth on gate and wall    Without a veil, O men of vision.(68)    Now hast thou abandoned the drop of life and come to the sea of the  Life-Bestower. This is the goal thou didst ask for; if it be God's will,  thou wilt gain it.    In this city, even the veils of light are split asunder and vanish away.  \"His beauty hath no veiling save light, His face no covering save  revelation.\"(69) How strange that while the Beloved is visible as the sun,  yet the heedless still hunt after tinsel and base metal. Yea, the  intensity of His revelation hath covered Him, and the fullness of His  shining forth hath hidden Him.      Even as the sun, bright hath He shined,    But alas, He hath come to the town of the blind!(70)    In this Valley, the wayfarer leaveth behind him the stages of the \"oneness  of Being and Manifestation\"(71) and reacheth a oneness that is sanctified  above these two stations. Ecstasy alone can encompass this theme, not  utterance nor argument; and whosoever hath dwelt at this stage of the  journey, or caught a breath from this garden land, knoweth whereof We  speak.    In all these journeys the traveler must stray not the breadth of a hair  from the \"Law,\" for this is indeed the secret of the \"Path\" and the fruit  of the Tree of \"Truth\"; and in all these stages he must cling to the robe  of obedience to the commandments, and hold fast to the cord of shunning  all forbidden things, that he may be nourished from the cup of the Law and  informed of the mysteries of Truth.(72)    If any of the utterances of this Servant may not be comprehended, or may  lead to perturbation, the same must be inquired of again, that no doubt  may linger, and the meaning be clear as the Face of the Beloved One  shining from the \"Glorious Station.\"(73)    These journeys have no visible ending in the world of time, but the  severed wayfarer--if invisible confirmation descend upon him and the  Guardian of the Cause assist him--may cross these seven stages in seven  steps, nay rather in seven breaths, nay rather in a single breath, if God  will and desire it. And this is of \"His grace on such of His servants as  He pleaseth.\"(74)    They who soar in the heaven of singleness and reach to the sea of the  Absolute, reckon this city--which is the station of life in God--as the  furthermost state of mystic knowers, and the farthest homeland of the  lovers. But to this evanescent One of the mystic ocean, this station is  the first gate of the heart's citadel, that is, man's first entrance to  the city of the heart; and the heart is endowed with four stages, which  would be recounted should a kindred soul be found.      When the pen set to picturing this station,    It broke in pieces and the page was torn.(75)    Salam!(76)    O My friend! Many a hound pursueth this gazelle of the desert of oneness;  many a talon claweth at this thrush of the eternal garden. Pitiless ravens  do lie in wait for this bird of the heavens of God, and the huntsman of  envy stalketh this deer of the meadow of love.    O Shaykh! Make of thine effort a glass, perchance it may shelter this  flame from the contrary winds; albeit this light doth long to be kindled  in the lamp of the Lord, and to shine in the globe of the spirit. For the  head raised up in the love of God will certainly fall by the sword, and  the life that is kindled with longing will surely be sacrificed, and the  heart which remembereth the Loved One will surely brim with blood. How  well is it said:      Live free of love, for its very peace is anguish;    Its beginning is pain, its end is death.(77)    Peace be upon him who followeth the Right Path!                                    * * * * *    The thoughts thou hast expressed as to the interpretation of the common  species of bird that is called in Persian Gunjishk (sparrow) were  considered.(78) Thou appearest to be well-grounded in mystic truth.  However, on every plane, to every letter a meaning is allotted which  relateth to that plane. Indeed, the wayfarer findeth a secret in every  name, a mystery in every letter. In one sense, these letters refer to  holiness.    Kaf or Gaf (K or G) referreth to Kuffi (\"free\"), that is, \"Free thyself  from that which thy passion desireth; then advance unto thy Lord.\"    Nun referreth to Nazzih (\"purify\"), that is, \"Purify thyself from all else  save Him, that thou mayest surrender thy life in His love.\"    Jim is Janib (\"draw back\"), that is, \"Draw back from the threshold of the  True One if thou still possessest earthly attributes.\"    Shin is Ushkur (\"thank\")--\"Thank thy Lord on His earth that He may bless  thee in His heaven; albeit in the world of oneness, this heaven is the  same as His earth.\"    Kaf referreth to Kuffi, that is: \"Take off from thyself the wrappings of  limitations, that thou mayest come to know what thou hast not known of the  states of Sanctity.\"(79)    Wert thou to harken to the melodies of this mortal Bird,(80) then wouldst  thou seek out the undying chalice and pass by every perishable cup.    Peace be upon those who walk in the Right Path!            THE FOUR VALLEYS          The Four Valleys      _He is the Strong, the Well-Beloved!_      O light of truth, Hisam-i-Din, the bounteous,    No prince hath the world begot like unto Thee!(81)    I am wondering why the tie of love was so abruptly severed, and the firm  covenant of friendship broken. Did ever, God forbid, My devotion lessen,  or My deep affection fail, that thou hast thus forgot Me and blotted Me  from thy thoughts?          What fault of Mine hath made thee cease thy favors?        Is it that We are lowly and thou of high degree?(82) Or is that a      single arrow hath driven thee from the battle?(83) Have they not      told thee that faithfulness is a duty on those who follow the      mystic way, that it is the true guide to His Holy Presence? \"But      as for those who say, 'Our Lord is God,' and who go straight to      Him, the angels shall descend to them....\"(84)      Likewise He saith, \"Go straight on then as thou hast been commanded.\"(85)  Wherefore, this course is incumbent on those who dwell in the presence of  God.      I do as bidden, and I bring the message,    Whether it give thee counsel or offense.(86)    Albeit I have"]]]
