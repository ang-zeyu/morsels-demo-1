Mayhap the Earl thinketh I  am to train boys to his dilly-dally household service as well as to use  of arms.\"    \"Sir,\" said Gascoyne, timidly, \"my Lord sayeth he would have this one  entered direct as a squire of the body, so that he need not serve in the  household.\"    \"Sayest so?\" cried Sir James, harshly. \"Then take thou my message back  again to thy Lord. Not for Mackworth--no, nor a better man than he--will  I make any changes in my government. An I be set to rule a pack of boys,  I will rule them as I list, and not according to any man's bidding.  Tell him, sirrah, that I will enter no lad as squire of the body without  first testing an he be fit at arms to hold that place.\" He sat for a  while glowering at Myles and gnawing his mustaches, and for the time  no one dared to break the grim silence. \"What is thy name?\" said he,  suddenly. And then, almost before Myles could answer, he asked the head  squire whether he could find a place to lodge him.    \"There is Gillis Whitlock's cot empty,\" said Blunt. \"He is in the  infirmary, and belike goeth home again when he cometh thence. The fever  hath gotten into his bones, and--\"    \"That will do,\" said the knight, interrupting him impatiently. \"Let him  take that place, or any other that thou hast. And thou, Jerome,\" said he  to his clerk, \"thou mayst enter him upon the roll, though whether it be  as page or squire or bachelor shall be as I please, and not as Mackworth  biddeth me. Now get ye gone.\"    \"Old Bruin's wound smarteth him sore,\" Gascoyne observed, as the two  lads walked across the armory court. He had good-naturedly offered to  show the new-comer the many sights of interest around the castle, and in  the hour or so of ramble that followed, the two grew from acquaintances  to friends with a quickness that boyhood alone can bring about. They  visited the armory, the chapel, the stables, the great hall, the Painted  Chamber, the guard-house, the mess-room, and even the scullery and the  kitchen, with its great range of boilers and furnaces and ovens. Last of  all Myles's new friend introduced him to the armor-smithy.    \"My Lord hath sent a piece of Milan armor thither to be repaired,\" said  he. \"Belike thou would like to see it.\"    \"Aye,\" said Myles, eagerly, \"that would I.\"    The smith was a gruff, good-natured fellow, and showed the piece of  armor to Myles readily and willingly enough. It was a beautiful bascinet  of inlaid workmanship, and was edged with a rim of gold. Myles scarcely  dared touch it; he gazed at it with an unconcealed delight that warmed  the smith's honest heart.    \"I have another piece of Milan here,\" said he. \"Did I ever show thee my  dagger, Master Gascoyne?\"    \"Nay,\" said the squire.    The smith unlocked a great oaken chest in the corner of the shop, lifted  the lid, and brought thence a beautiful dagger with the handle of ebony  and silver-gilt, and a sheath of Spanish leather, embossed and gilt.  The keen, well-tempered blade was beautifully engraved and inlaid  with niello-work, representing a group of figures in a then popular  subject--the dance of Death. It was a weapon at once unique and  beautiful, and even Gascoyne showed an admiration scarcely less keen  than Myles's openly-expressed delight.    \"To whom doth it belong?\" said he, trying the point upon his thumb nail.    \"There,\" said the smith, \"is the jest of the whole, for it belongeth  to me. Sir William Beauclerk bade me order the weapon through Master  Gildersworthy, of London town, and by the time it came hither, lo! he  had died, and so it fell to my hands. No one here payeth the price for  the trinket, and so I must e'en keep it myself, though I be but a poor  man.\"    \"How much dost thou hold it for?\" said Gascoyne.    \"Seventeen shillings buyeth it,\" said the armorer, carelessly.    \"Aye, aye,\" said Gascoyne, with a sigh; \"so it is to be poor, and not be  able to have such things as one loveth and would fain possess. Seventeen  shillings is nigh as much by half again as all my yearly wage.\"    Then a sudden thought came to Myles, and as it came his cheeks glowed  as hot as fire \"Master Gascoyne,\" said he, with gruff awkwardness,  \"thou hast been a very good, true friend to me since I have come to this  place, and hast befriended me in all ways thou mightest do, and I, as  well I know, but a poor rustic clod. Now I have forty shillings by me  which I may spend as I list, and so I do beseech thee that thou wilt  take yon dagger of me as a love-gift, and have and hold it for thy very  own.\"    Gascoyne stared open-mouthed at Myles. \"Dost mean it?\" said he, at last.    \"Aye,\" said Myles, \"I do mean it. Master Smith, give him the blade.\"    At first the smith grinned, thinking it all a jest; but he soon saw that  Myles was serious enough, and when the seventeen shillings were produced  and counted down upon the anvil, he took off his cap and made Myles a  low bow as he swept them into his pouch. \"Now, by my faith and troth,\"  quoth he, \"that I do call a true lordly gift. Is it not so, Master  Gascoyne?\"    \"Aye,\" said Gascoyne, with a gulp, \"it is, in soothly earnest.\" And  thereupon, to Myles's great wonderment, he suddenly flung his arms about  his neck, and, giving him a great hug, kissed him upon the cheek. \"Dear  Myles,\" said he, \"I tell thee truly and of a verity I did feel warm  towards thee from the very first time I saw thee sitting like a poor oaf  upon the bench up yonder in the anteroom, and now of a sooth I give thee  assurance that I do love thee as my own brother. Yea, I will take the  dagger, and will stand by thee as a true friend from this time forth.  Mayhap thou mayst need a true friend in this place ere thou livest long  with us, for some of us esquires be soothly rough, and knocks are more  plenty here than broad pennies, so that one new come is like to have a  hard time gaining a footing.\"    \"I thank thee,\" said Myles, \"for thy offer of love and friendship, and  do tell thee, upon my part, that I also of all the world would like best  to have thee for my friend.\"    Such was the manner In which Myles formed the first great friendship of  his life, a friendship that was destined to last him through many years  to come. As the two walked back across the great quadrangle, upon which  fronted the main buildings of the castle, their arms were wound across  one another's shoulders, after the manner, as a certain great writer  says, of boys and lovers.        CHAPTER 6    A boy's life is of a very flexible sort. It takes but a little while for  it to shape itself to any new surroundings in which it may be thrown, to  make itself new friends, to settle itself to new habits; and so it was  that Myles fell directly into the ways of the lads of Devlen. On his  first morning, as he washed his face and hands with the other squires  and pages in a great tank of water in the armory court-yard, he  presently found himself splashing and dashing with the others, laughing  and shouting as loud as any, and calling some by their Christian names  as though he had known them for years instead of overnight. During  chapel he watched with sympathetic delight the covert pranks of the  youngsters during the half-hour that Father Emmanuel droned his Latin,  and with his dagger point he carved his own name among the many cut  deep into the back of the bench before him. When, after breakfast, the  squires poured like school-boys into the great armory to answer to the  roll-call for daily exercise, he came storming in with the rest, beating  the lad in front of him with his cap.    Boys are very keen to feel the influence of a forceful character. A lad  with a strong will is quick to reach his proper level as a greater or  lesser leader among the others, and Myles was of just the masterful  nature to make his individuality felt among the Devlen squires. He was  quick enough to yield obedience upon all occasions to proper authority,  but would never bend an inch to the usurpation of tyranny. In the school  at St. Mary's Priory at Crosbey-Dale he would submit without a murmur or  offer of resistance to chastisement by old Father Ambrose, the  regular teacher; but once, when the fat old monk was sick, and a great  long-legged strapping young friar, who had temporarily taken his place,  undertook to administer punishment, Myles, with a wrestling trip, flung  him sprawling backward over a bench into the midst of a shoal of small  boys amid a hubbub of riotous confusion. He had been flogged soundly  for it under the supervision of Prior Edward himself; but so soon as  his punishment was over, he assured the prior very seriously that should  like occasion again happen he would act in the same manner, flogging or  no flogging.    It was this bold, outspoken spirit that gained him at once friends and  enemies at Devlen, and though it first showed itself in what was but a  little matter, nevertheless it set a mark upon him that singled him out  from the rest, and, although he did not suspect it at the time, called  to him the attention of Sir James Lee himself, who regarded him as a lad  of free and frank spirit.    The first morning after the roll-call in the armory, as Walter Blunt,  the head bachelor, rolled up the slip of parchment, and the temporary  silence burst forth into redoubled noise and confusion, each lad arming  himself from a row of racks that stood along the wall, he beckoned Myles  to him.    \"My Lord himself hath spoken to Sir James Lee concerning thee,\" said he.  \"Sir James maintaineth that he will not enter thee into the body till  thou hast first practised for a while at the pels, and shown what thou  canst do at broadsword. Hast ever fought at the pel?\"    \"Aye,\" answered Myles, \"and that every day of my life sin I became  esquire four years ago, saving only Sundays and holy days.\"    \"With shield and broadsword?\"    \"Sometimes,\" said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#5)"],[1,"shot at in the dark and once slightly injured.  Rumor had it that Jack Blome, the gunman of those parts, was coming in  to meet Steele. Part of Linrock awakened and another part, much smaller,  became quieter, more secluded.    Strangers upon whom we could get no line mysteriously came and went. The  drinking, gambling, fighting in the resorts seemed to gather renewed  life. Abundance of money floated in circulation.    And rumors, vague and unfounded, crept in from Sanderson and other  points, rumors of a gang of rustlers off here, a hold-up of the stage  off here, robbery of a rancher at this distant point, and murder done at  another.    This was Texas and New Mexico life in these frontier days but, strangely  neither Steele nor I had yet been able to associate any rumor or act  with a possible gang of rustlers in Linrock.    Nevertheless we had not been discouraged. After three weeks of waiting  we had become alive to activity around us, and though it was unseen, we  believed we would soon be on its track.    My task was the busier and the easier. Steele had to have a care for his  life. I never failed to caution him of this.    My long reflection on the month's happenings and possibilities was  brought to an end by the appearance of Miss Sampson and Sally.    My employer looked worried. Sally was in a regular cowgirl riding  costume, in which her trim, shapely figure showed at its best, and her  face was saucy, sparkling, daring.    \"Good morning, Russ,\" said Miss Sampson and she gazed searchingly at me.  I had dropped off the fence, sombrero in hand. I knew I was in for a  lecture, and I put on a brazen, innocent air.    \"Did you break your promise to me?\" she asked reproachfully.    \"Which one?\" I asked. It was Sally's bright eyes upon me, rather than  Miss Sampson's reproach, that bothered me.    \"About getting drunk again,\" she said.    \"I didn't break _that_ one.\"    \"My cousin George saw you in the Hope So gambling place last night,  drunk, staggering, mixing with that riffraff, on the verge of a brawl.\"    \"Miss Sampson, with all due respect to Mr. Wright, I want to say that he  has a strange wish to lower me in the eyes of you ladies,\" I protested  with a fine show of spirit.    \"Russ, _were_ you drunk?\" she demanded.    \"No. I should think you needn't ask me that. Didn't you ever see a man  the morning after a carouse?\"    Evidently she had. And there I knew I stood, fresh, clean-shaven,  clear-eyed as the morning.    Sally's saucy face grew thoughtful, too. The only thing she had ever  asked of me was not to drink. The habit had gone hard with the Sampson  family.    \"Russ, you look just as--as nice as I'd want you to,\" Miss Sampson  replied. \"I don't know what to think. They tell me things. You deny.  Whom shall I believe? George swore he saw you.\"    \"Miss Sampson, did I ever lie to you?\"    \"Not to my knowledge.\"    Then I looked at her, and she understood what I meant.    \"George has lied to me. That day at Sanderson. And since, too, I fear.  Do you say he lies?\"    \"Miss Sampson, I would not call your cousin a liar.\"    Here Sally edged closer, with the bridle rein of her horse over her arm.    \"Russ, cousin George isn't the only one who saw you. Burt Waters told me  the same,\" said Sally nervously. I believed she hoped I was telling the  truth.    \"Waters! So he runs me down behind my back. All right, I won't say a  word about him. But do you believe I was drunk when I say no?\"    \"I'm afraid I do, Russ,\" she replied in reluctance. Was she testing me?    \"See here, Miss Sampson,\" I burst out. \"Why don't you discharge me?  Please let me go. I'm not claiming much for myself, but you don't  believe even that. I'm pretty bad. I never denied the scraps, the  gambling--all that. But I did do as Miss Sally asked me--I did keep my  promise to you. Now, discharge me. Then I'll be free to call on Mr. Burt  Waters.\"    Miss Sampson looked alarmed and Sally turned pale, to my extreme joy.    Those girls believed I was a desperate devil of a cowboy, who had been  held back from spilling blood solely through their kind relation to me.    \"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Sally. \"Diane, don't let him go!\"    \"Russ, pray don't get angry,\" replied Miss Sampson and she put a soft  hand on me that thrilled me, while it made me feel like a villain. \"I  won't discharge you. I need you. Sally needs you. After all, it's none  of my business what you do away from here. But I hoped I would be so  happy to--to reclaim you from--Didn't you ever have a sister, Russ?\"    I kept silent for fear that I would perjure myself anew. Yet the  situation was delicious, and suddenly I conceived a wild idea.    \"Miss Sampson,\" I began haltingly, but with brave front, \"I've been wild  in the past. But I've been tolerably straight here, trying to please  you. Lately I have been going to the bad again. Not drunk, but leaning  that way. Lord knows what I'll do soon if--if my trouble isn't cured.\"    \"Russ! What trouble?\"    \"You know what's the matter with me,\" I went on hurriedly. \"Anybody  could see that.\"    Sally turned a flaming scarlet. Miss Sampson made it easier for me by  reason of her quick glance of divination.    \"I've fallen in love with Miss Sally. I'm crazy about her. Here I've got  to see these fellows flirting with her. And it's killing me. I've--\"    \"If you are crazy about me, you don't have to tell!\" cried Sally, red  and white by turns.    \"I want to stop your flirting one way or another. I've been in earnest.  I wasn't flirting. I begged you to--to...\"    \"You never did,\" interrupted Sally furiously. That hint had been a  spark.    \"I couldn't have dreamed it,\" I protested, in a passion to be earnest,  yet tingling with the fun of it. \"That day when I--didn't I ask...\"    \"If my memory serves me correctly, you didn't ask anything,\" she  replied, with anger and scorn now struggling with mirth.    \"But, Sally, I meant to. You understood me? Say you didn't believe I  could take that liberty without honorable intentions.\"    That was too much for Sally. She jumped at her horse, made the quickest  kind of a mount, and was off like a flash.    \"Stop me if you can,\" she called back over her shoulder, her face alight  and saucy.    \"Russ, go after her,\" said Miss Sampson. \"In that mood she'll ride to  Sanderson. My dear fellow, don't stare so. I understand many things now.  Sally is a flirt. She would drive any man mad. Russ, I've grown in a  short time to like you. If you'll be a man--give up drinking and  gambling--maybe you'll have a chance with her. Hurry now--go after her.\"    I mounted and spurred my horse after Sally's. She was down on the level  now, out in the open, and giving her mount his head. Even had I wanted  to overhaul her at once the matter would have been difficult, well nigh  impossible under five miles.    Sally had as fast a horse as there was on the range; she made no weight  in the saddle, and she could ride. From time to time she looked back  over her shoulder.    I gained enough to make her think I was trying to catch her. Sally loved  a horse; she loved a race; she loved to win.    My good fortune had given me more than one ride alone with Sally. Miss  Sampson enjoyed riding, too; but she was not a madcap, and when she  accompanied us there was never any race.    When Sally got out alone with me she made me ride to keep her from  disappearing somewhere on the horizon. This morning I wanted her to  enjoy to the fullest her utter freedom and to feel that for once I could  not catch her.    Perhaps my declaration to Miss Sampson had liberated my strongest  emotions.    However that might be, the fact was that no ride before had ever been  like this one--no sky so blue, no scene so open, free, and enchanting as  that beautiful gray-green range, no wind so sweet. The breeze that  rushed at me might have been laden with the perfume of Sally Langdon's  hair.    I sailed along on what seemed a strange ride. Grazing horses pranced and  whistled as I went by; jack-rabbits bounded away to hide in the longer  clumps of grass; a prowling wolf trotted from his covert near a herd of  cattle.    Far to the west rose the low, dark lines of bleak mountains. They were  always mysterious to me, as if holding a secret I needed to know.    It was a strange ride because in the back of my head worked a haunting  consciousness of the deadly nature of my business there on the frontier,  a business in such contrast with this dreaming and dallying, this  longing for what surely was futile.    Any moment I might be stripped of my disguise. Any moment I might have  to be the Ranger.    Sally kept the lead across the wide plain, and mounted to the top of a  ridge, where tired out, and satisfied with her victory, she awaited me.  I was in no hurry to reach the summit of the long, slow-sloping ridge,  and I let my horse walk.    Just how would Sally Langdon meet me now, after my regretted exhibition  before her cousin? There was no use to conjecture, but I was not  hopeful.    When I got there to find her in her sweetest mood, with some little  difference never before noted--a touch of shyness--I concealed my  surprise.    \"Russ, I gave you a run that time,\" she said. \"Ten miles and you never  caught me!\"    \"But look at the start you had. I've had my troubles beating you with an  even break.\"    Sally was susceptible to flattery in regard to her riding, a fact that  I made subtle use of.    \"But in a long race I was afraid you'd beat me. Russ, I've learned to  ride out here. Back home I never had room to ride a horse. Just look.  Miles and miles of level, of green. Little hills with black bunches of  trees. Not a soul in sight. Even the town hidden in the green. All wild  and lonely. Isn't it glorious, Russ?\"    \"Lately it's been getting to me,\" I replied soberly.    We both gazed out over the sea of gray-green, at the undulating waves  of ground in the distance. On these rides with her I had learned to  appreciate the beauty of the"]]]
