(31) Yea, by My Lord! They that dwell  within this Ocean, they that ride upon this Ark, witness no change in the  creation of God and behold no differences upon His earth. And if God's  creation be not prone to change and alteration, how then could they who  are the Manifestations of His own Being be subject to it? Immeasurably  exalted is God above all that we may conceive of the Revealers of His  Cause, and immensely glorified is He beyond all that they may mention in  His regard!    43      Great God! This sea had laid up lustrous pearls in store;    The wind hath raised a wave that casteth them ashore.    So put away thy robe and drown thyself therein,    And cease to boast of skill: it serveth thee no more!    44 If thou be of the inmates of this city within the ocean of divine  unity, thou wilt view all the Prophets and Messengers of God as one soul  and one body, as one light and one spirit, in such wise that the first  among them would be last and the last would be first. For they have all  arisen to proclaim His Cause and have established the laws of divine  wisdom. They are, one and all, the Manifestations of His Self, the  Repositories of His might, the Treasuries of His Revelation, the  Dawning-Places of His splendour, and the Daysprings of His light. Through  them are manifested the signs of sanctity in the realities of all things  and the tokens of oneness in the essences of all beings. Through them are  revealed the elements of glorification in the heavenly realities and the  exponents of praise in the eternal essences. From them hath all creation  proceeded and unto them shall return all that hath been mentioned. And  since in their inmost Beings they are the same Luminaries and the  self-same Mysteries, thou shouldst view their outward conditions in the  same light, that thou mayest recognize them all as one Being, nay, find  them united in their words, speech, and utterance.    45 Wert thou to consider in this station the last of them to be the first,  or conversely, thou wouldst indeed be speaking the truth, as hath been  ordained by Him Who is the Wellspring of Divinity and the Source of  Lordship: \"Say: Call upon God or call upon the All-Merciful: by  whichsoever name ye will, invoke him, for He hath most excellent  names.\"(32) For they are all the Manifestations of the name of God, the  Dawning-Places of His attributes, the Repositories of His might, and the  Focal Points of His sovereignty, whilst God--magnified be His might and  glory--is in His Essence sanctified above all names and exalted beyond even  the loftiest attributes. Consider likewise the evidences of divine  omnipotence both in their Souls and in their human Temples, that thine  heart may be assured and that thou mayest be of them that speed through  the realms of His nearness.    46 I shall restate here My theme, that perchance this may assist thee in  recognizing thy Creator. Know thou that God--exalted and glorified be  He--doth in no wise manifest His inmost Essence and Reality. From time  immemorial He hath been veiled in the eternity of His Essence and  concealed in the infinitude of His own Being. And when He purposed to  manifest His beauty in the kingdom of names and to reveal His glory in the  realm of attributes, He brought forth His Prophets from the invisible  plane to the visible, that His name \"the Manifest\" might be distinguished  from \"the Hidden\" and His name \"the Last\" might be discerned from \"the  First\", and that there may be fulfilled the words: \"He is the First and  the Last; the Seen and the Hidden; and He knoweth all things!\"(33) Thus  hath He revealed these most excellent names and most exalted words in the  Manifestations of His Self and the Mirrors of His Being.    47 It is therefore established that all names and attributes return unto  these sublime and sanctified Luminaries. Indeed, all names are to be found  in their names, and all attributes can be seen in their attributes. Viewed  in this light, if thou wert to call them by all the names of God, this  would be true, as all these names are one and the same as their own Being.  Comprehend then the intent of these words, and guard it within the  tabernacle of thy heart, that thou mayest recognize the implications of  thine inquiry, fulfil them according to that which God hath ordained for  thee, and thus be numbered with those who have attained unto His purpose.    48 All that thou hast heard regarding Muhammad the son of Hasan(34)--may  the souls of all that are immersed in the oceans of the spirit be offered  up for His sake--is true beyond the shadow of a doubt, and we all verily  bear allegiance unto Him. But the Imams of the Faith have fixed His abode  in the city of Jabulqa,(35) which they have depicted in strange and  marvellous signs. To interpret this city according to the literal meaning  of the tradition would indeed prove impossible, nor can such a city ever  be found. Wert thou to search the uttermost corners of the earth, nay  probe its length and breadth for as long as God's eternity hath lasted and  His sovereignty will endure, thou wouldst never find a city such as they  have described, for the entirety of the earth could neither contain nor  encompass it. If thou wouldst lead Me unto this city, I could assuredly  lead thee unto this holy Being, Whom the people have conceived according  to what they possess and not to that which pertaineth unto Him! Since this  is not in thy power, thou hast no recourse but to interpret symbolically  the accounts and traditions that have been reported from these luminous  souls. And, as such an interpretation is needed for the traditions  pertaining to the aforementioned city, so too is it required for this holy  Being. When thou hast understood this interpretation, thou shalt no longer  stand in need of \"transformation\" or aught else.    49 Know then that, inasmuch as all the Prophets are but one and the same  soul, spirit, name, and attribute, thou must likewise see them all as  bearing the name Muhammad and as being the son of Hasan, as having  appeared from the Jabulqa of God's power and from the Jabulsa of His  mercy. For by Jabulqa is meant none other than the treasure-houses of  eternity in the all-highest heaven and the cities of the unseen in the  supernal realm. We bear witness that Muhammad, the son of Hasan, was  indeed in Jabulqa and appeared therefrom. Likewise, He Whom God shall make  manifest abideth in that city until such time as God will have established  Him upon the seat of His sovereignty. We, verily, acknowledge this truth  and bear allegiance unto each and every one of them. We have chosen here  to be brief in our elucidation of the meanings of Jabulqa, but if thou be  of them that truly believe, thou shalt indeed comprehend all the true  meanings of the mysteries enshrined within these Tablets.    50 But as to Him Who appeared in the year sixty, He standeth in need of  neither transformation nor interpretation, for His name was Muhammad, and  He was a descendent of the Imams of the Faith. Thus it can be truly said  of Him that He was the son of Hasan, as is undoubtedly clear and evident  unto thine eminence. Nay, He it is Who fashioned that name and created it  for Himself, were ye to observe with the eye of God.    51 It is Our wish at this juncture to digress from Our theme to recount  that which befell the Point of the Qur'an,(36) and to extol His  remembrance, that perchance thou mayest gain into all things an insight  born of Him Who is the Almighty, the Incomparable.    52 Consider and reflect upon His days, when God raised Him up to promote  His Cause and to stand as the representative of His own Self. Witness how  He was assailed, denied, and denounced by all; how, when He set foot in  the streets and marketplaces, the people derided Him, wagged their heads  at Him, and laughed Him to scorn; how at every moment they sought to slay  Him. Such were their doings that the earth in all its vastness was  straitened for Him, the Concourse on High bewailed His plight, the  foundations of existence were reduced to nothingness, and the eyes of the  well-favoured denizens of His Kingdom wept sore over Him. Indeed, so  grievous were the afflictions which the infidels and the wicked showered  upon Him that no faithful soul can bear to hear them.    53 If these wayward souls had indeed paused to reflect upon their conduct,  recognized the sweet melodies of that Mystic Dove singing upon the twigs  of this snow-white Tree, embraced that which God had revealed unto and  bestowed upon them, and discovered the fruits of the Tree of God upon its  branches, wherefore then did they reject and denounce Him? Had they not  lifted their heads to the heavens to implore His appearance? Had they not  besought God at every moment to honour them with His Beauty and sustain  them through His presence?    54 But as they failed to recognize the accents of God and the divine  mysteries and holy allusions enshrined in that which flowed from the  tongue of Muhammad, and as they neglected to examine the matter in their  own hearts, and followed instead those priests of error who have hindered  the progress of the people in past dispensations and who will continue to  do so in future cycles, they were thus veiled from the divine purpose,  failed to quaff from the celestial streams, and deprived themselves of the  presence of God, the Manifestation of His Essence, and the Dayspring of  His eternity. Thus did they wander in the paths of delusion and the ways  of heedlessness, and return to their abode in that fire which feedeth on  their own souls."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1694"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: The First Thousand Years: 600 - 1600 (#5)"],[1,"he mow.    2.

To restore education and religion, Alfred disseminated the  Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, the Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical  History of the English Nation, the Providence of Boethius on the  goodness of God, and Pope Gregory's Pastoral Care, which he had  translated into English and was the fundamental book on the duty  of a bishop, and included his duty to teach laymen. Alfred's  advice to pastors was to live as they had been taught from  books and to teach this manner of life to others. To be avoided  was pride, the mind's deception of seeking glory in the name of  doing good works, and the corruption of high office. Bede was  England's first scholar, first theologian, and first historian.  He wrote poetry, theological books, and textbooks on grammar,  rhetoric [public speaking and debating], arithmetic, and  astronomy. He began the practice of dating years from the birth  of Christ.    A famous poem, the oral legend of Beowulf, a hero who led his men  into adventures and performed great feats and fought monsters  and dragons, was put into writing with a Christian theme. In it,  loyalty to one's lord is a paramount virtue. Also available in  writing was the story of King Arthur's twelve victorious battles  against the pagan Saxons, authored by Nennius.    There were professional story-tellers attached to great men.  Others wandered from court to court, receiving gifts for their  story-telling. Men usually told oral legends of their own feats  and those of their ancestors after supper.    Alfred had monasteries rebuilt with learned and moral men heading  them. He built a strong wall with four gates around London,  which he had conquered. He appointed one of his eorldormen to be  alderman [older man] to govern London and to be the shire's  earl. A later King built a palace in London, although Winchester  was still the royal capital town. When the King traveled, he and  his retinue would be fed by the local people at their expense.    Under the royalty were the nobles. An earl headed each shire. He  led the array of his shire to do battle if the shire was  attacked. He and the local bishop presided over shire meetings  and meetings of the people. Reeves were appointed by the King as  his representatives in the shires. The reeve took security from  every person for the maintenance of the public peace. He also  brought suspects to court, gave judgments according to the  doom-books, delivered offenders to punishment. By service to the  King, it was possible for a coerl to rise to become a thegn and  to be given land by the King. The King's thegns who got their  position by fighting for the King came to be known as knights.  Other thegns performed functions of magistrates. A thegn was  later identified as a person with five hides of land, a church,  a bell-house, a judicial at the burgh-gate, and an office or  station in the King's hall. Some thegns reached nobility status  with a wergeld of 1200 s. when a freeman's wergeld was 200s. They  also were given a higher legal status in the scale of  punishment, giving credible evidence, and participation in legal  proceedings. The sokemen were freemen who had inherited their  own land, chose their own lord, and attended their lord's court.  That is, their lord has soc jurisdiction over them. A smallholder  rented land of about 30 acres from a landlord, which he paid by  doing work on the lord's demesne [household] land, paying money  rent, or paying a food rent such as in eggs or chickens.  Smallholders made up about two-fifths of the population. A  cottager had one to five acres of land and depended on others for  his living. Among these were shepherds, ploughmen, swineherds,  and blacksmiths. They also participated in the agricultural  work, especially at harvest time.    It was possible for a thegn to acquire enough land to qualify him  for the witan [King's council of wise men, which included  archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, chief landholders, and  officers of the King's household; and also chose the King's  successor on his death]. Women could be present at the  witenagemot [meeting of the witan, which met three times  annually] and shire-gemot [meeting of the shire]. They could sue  and be sued in the courts. They could independently inherit,  possess, and dispose of property. A wife's inheritance was her  own and under no control of her husband.    Marriage required the consent of the lady and her friends. The  man also had to arrange for the foster-lean, that is, money for  the support of expected children. He also declared the amount of  money or land he would give the lady for her consent, that is,  the morgengift, and what he would bequeath her in case of his  death. If she remarried within a year of his death, she had to  forfeit the morgengift.    Great men and monasteries had millers, smiths, carpenters,  architects, agriculturalists, fishermen, weavers, embroiderers,  dyers, and illuminators.    For entertainment, minstrels sang ballads about heroes or Bible  stories, harpers played, jesters joked, and tumblers threw and  caught balls and knives. There was gambling, dice games, and  chasing deer with hounds.    Fraternal guilds were established for mutual advantage and  protection. A guild imposed fines for any injury of one member  by another member. It assisted in paying any murder fine imposed  on a member. It avenged the murder of a member and abided by the  consequences. It buried its members and purchased masses for his  soul.    Merchantile guilds in sea-ports carried out commercial  speculations not possible by the capital of only one person.    There were some ale-houses.      The Law    Alfred issued a set of laws to cover the whole country.    The importance of telling the truth and keeping one's word are  expressed by this law: \"1. At the first we teach that it is most  needful that every man warily keep his oath and his wed. If any  one be constrained to either of these wrongfully, either to  treason against his lord, or to any unlawful aid; then it is  juster to belie than to fulfil. But if he pledge himself to that  which is lawful to fulfil, and in that belie himself, let him  submissively deliver up his weapon and his goods to the keeping  of his friends, and be in prison forty days in a King's tun: let  him there suffer whatever the bishop may prescribe to him: ...\".    The Ten Commandments were written down as this law:    \"The Lord spake these words to Moses, and thus said: I am the  Lord thy God. I led thee out of the land of the Egyptians, and  of their bondage.    1. Love thou not other strange gods above me.    2. Utter thou not my name idly, for thou shalt not be guiltless  towards me if thou utter my name idly.    3. Remember that thou hallow the rest-day. Work for yourselves  six days, and on the seventh rest. For in six days, Christ  wrought the heavens and the earth, the seas, and all creatures  that are in them, and rested on the seventh day: and therefore  the Lord hallowed it.    4. Honour thy father and thy mother whom the Lord hath given  thee, that thou mayst be the longer living on earth.    5. Slay thou not.    6. Commit thou not adultery.    7. Steal thou not.    8. Say thou not false witness.    9. Covet thou not thy neighbour's goods unjustly.    10. Make thou not to thyself golden or silver gods.\"     If one deceives an unbetrothed woman and sleep with her, he must  pay for her and have her afterwards to wife. But if her father  not approve, he should pay money according to her dowry.    \"If a man seize hold of the breast of a ceorlish woman, let him  make bot to her with 5 shillings. If he throw her down and do  not lie with her, let him make bot with 10 shillings. If he lie  with her, let him"]]]
