When they were dragged  out, they were dead. In most cases, however, these little martyrs  suffered and died noiselessly, in the gloom of the guard-houses,  barracks, and military hospitals. They strewed with their tiny bodies  the roads that led into the outlying regions of the Empire, and those  that managed to get there were fading away slowly in the barracks which  had been turned into inquisitorial dungeons. This martyrdom of children,  set in a military environment, represents a singular phenomenon even in  the extensive annals of Jewish martyrology.    [Footnote 1: A variant of the legend speaks of a review by the Tzar  himself.]    Such was the lot of the juvenile cantonists. As for the adult recruits,  who were drafted into the army at the normal age of conscription  (18-25), their conversion to Christianity was not pursued by the same  direct methods, but their fate was not a whit less tragic from the  moment of their capture till the end of their grievous twenty-five  years' service. Youths, who had no knowledge of the Russian language,  were torn away from the heder or yeshibah, often from wife and children.    In consequence of the early marriages then in vogue, most youths at the  age of eighteen were married. The impending separation for a quarter of  a century, added to the danger of the soldier's apostasy or death in  far-off regions, often disrupted the family ties. Many recruits, before  entering upon their military career, gave their wives a divorce so as  not to doom them to perpetual widowhood.    At the end of 1834 rumors began to spread among the Jewish masses  concerning a law which was about to be issued forbidding early marriages  but exempting from conscription those married prior to the promulgation  of the law. A panic ensued. Everywhere feverish haste was displayed in  marrying off boys from ten to fifteen years old to girls of an equally  tender age. Within a few months there appeared in every city hundreds  and thousands of such couples, whose marital relations were often  confined to playing with nuts or bones. The misunderstanding which had  caused this senseless matrimonial panic or _beholoh,_[1] as it was  afterwards popularly called, was cleared up by the publication, on April  13, 1835, of the new \"Statute on the Jews.\" To be sure, the new law  contained a clause forbidding marriages before the age of eighteen, but  it offered no privileges for those already married, so that the only  result of the _beholoh_ was to increase the number of families robbed by  conscription of their heads and supporters.    [Footnote 1: A Hebrew word, also used in Yiddish, meaning _fright,  panic_.]    The years of military service were spent by the grown-up Jewish soldiers  amidst extraordinary hardships. They were beaten and ridiculed because  of their inability to express themselves in Russian, their refusal to  eat _trefa_, and their general lack of adaptation to the strange  environment and to the military mode of life. And even when this process  of adaptation was finally accomplished, the Jewish soldier was never  promoted beyond the position of a non-commissioned under-officer,  baptism being the inevitable stepping-stone to a higher rank. True, the  Statute on Military Service promised those Jewish soldiers who had  completed their term in the army with distinction admission to the civil  service, but the promise remained on paper so long as the candidates  were loyal to Judaism. On the contrary, the Jews who had completed their  military service and had in most cases become invalids were not even  allowed to spend the rest of their lives in the localities outside the  Pale, in which they had been stationed as soldiers. Only at a later  period, during the reign of Alexander II., was this right accorded to  the \"Nicholas soldiers\" [1] and their descendants.    [Footnote 1: In Russian, _Nikolayevskiye soldaty_, i.e., those that had  served in the army during the reign of Nicholas I.]    The full weight of conscription fell upon the poorest classes of the  Jewish population, the so-called burgher estate, [1] consisting of petty  artisans and those impoverished tradesmen who could not afford to enrol  in the mercantile guilds, though there are cases on record where poor  Jews begged from door to door to collect a sufficient sum of money for a  guild certificate in order to save their children from military service.  The more or less well-to-do were exempted from conscription either by  virtue of their mercantile status or because of their connections with  the Kahal leaders who had the power of selecting the victims.    [Footnote 1: See above, p. 23, n. 1.]      4. THE POLICY OF EXPULSIONS    In all lands of Western Europe the introduction of personal military  service for the Jews was either accompanied or preceded by their  emancipation. At all events, it was followed by some mitigation of their  disabilities, serving, so to speak, as an earnest of the grant of equal  rights. Even in clerical Austria, the imposition of military duty upon  the Jews was preceded by the _Toleranz Patent_, this would-be Act of  Emancipation. [1]    [Footnote 1: Military service was imposed upon the Jews of Austria by  the law of 1787. Several years previously, on January 2, 1782, Emperor  Joseph II. had issued his famous Toleration Act, removing a number of  Jewish disabilities and opening the way to their assimilation with the  environment. Nevertheless, most of the former restrictions remained in  force.]    In Russia the very reverse took place. The introduction of military  conscription of a most aggravating kind and the unspeakable cruelties  attending its practical execution were followed, in the case of the  Jews, by an unprecedented recrudescence of legislative discrimination  and a monstrous increase of their disabilities. The Jews were lashed  with a double knout, a military and a civil. In the same ill-fated year  which saw the promulgation of the conscription statute, barely three  months after it had received the imperial sanction, while the moans of  the Jews, fasting and praying to God to deliver them from the calamity,  were still echoing in the synagogues, two new ukases were issued, both  signed on December 2, 1827--the one decreeing the transfer of the Jews  from all villages and village inns in the government of Grodno into the  towns and townlets, the other ordering the banishment of all Jewish  residents from the city of Kiev.    The expulsion from the Grodno villages was the continuation of the  policy of the _rural_ liquidation of Jewry, inaugurated in 1823 in White  Russia. [1] The Grodno province was merely meant to serve as a starting  point. Grand Duke Constantine, [2] who had brought up the question, was  ordered \"_at first_ to carry out the expulsion in the government of  Grodno alone,\" and to postpone for a later occasion the application of  the same measure to the other \"governments entrusted to his command.\"  Simultaneously considerable foresight was displayed in instructing the  grand duke to wait with the expulsion of the Jews \"until the conclusion  of the military conscription going on at present.\" Evidently there was  some fear of disorders and complications. It was thought wiser to seize  the children for the army first and then to expel the parents--to get  hold of the young birds and then to destroy the nest.    [Footnote 1: It may be remarked here that the principal enactments of  that period, down to 1835, were, drafted in their preliminary stage by  the \"Jewish Committee\" established in 1823. See Vol. I, p. 407 _et  seq._]    [Footnote 2: Commander-in-Chief of the former Polish provinces. See p.  16, n. 2.]    The expulsion from Kiev was of a different order. It marked the  beginning of a new system, the narrowing down of the _urban_ area  allotted to the Jews within the Pale of Settlement. Since 1794 [1] the  Jews had been allowed to settle in Kiev freely. They had formed there,  with official sanction, an important community and had vastly developed  commerce and industry. Suddenly, however, the Government discovered that  \"their presence is detrimental to the industry of this city and to the  exchequer in general, and is, moreover, at variance with the rights and  privileges conferred at different periods upon the city of Kiev.\" The  discovery was followed by a grim rescript from St. Petersburg,  forbidding not only the further settlement of Jews in Kiev but also  prescribing that even those settled there long ago should leave the city  within one year, those owning immovable property within two years.  Henceforward only the temporary sojourn of Jews, for a period not  exceeding six months, was to be permitted and to be limited, moreover,  to merchants of the first two guilds who arrive \"in connection with  contracts and fairs\" or to attend to public bids and deliveries.    [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 317.]    In 1829 the whip of expulsion cracked over the backs of the Jews  dwelling on the shores of the Baltic and the Black Sea. In Courland and  Livonia measures were taken \"looking to the reduction of the number of  Jews\" which had been considerably swelled by the influx of  \"newcomers\"--of Jews not born in those provinces and therefore having no  right to settle there. The Tzar endorsed the proposal of the \"Jewish  Committee\" to transfer from Courland all Jews not born there into the  cities in which their birth was registered. Those not yet registered in  a municipality outside the province were granted a half-year's respite  for that purpose. If within the prescribed term they failed to attend to  their registration, they were to be sent to the army, or, in case of  unfitness for military service, deported to Siberia.    In the same year an imperial ukase declared that \"the residence of  civilian Jews in the cities of Sevastopol and Nicholayev was  inconvenient and injurious,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],[0,"The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#5)"],[1,"a prospect of another  Norther. The Panther unrolled from his pack the most gorgeous serape  that Ned had ever seen. It was of the finest material, colored a deep  scarlet and it had a gold fringe.    \"Fine feathers are seen afar,\" said Obed.    \"That's so,\" said the Panther, \"but we're not coming near enough to the  Mexicans for them to catch a glimpse of this, an' such bein' the case  I'm goin' to put it between me an' the cold. I'm proud of it, an' when I  wrap it aroun' me I feel bigger an' stronger. Its red color helps me. I  think I draw strength from red, just as I do from a fine, tender buffalo  steak.\"    He spoke with much earnestness, and the other two did not contradict  him. Meanwhile he gracefully folded the great serape about his  shoulders, letting it fall to the saddle. No Mexican could have worn it  more rakishly.    \"That's my shield and protector,\" he said. \"Now blow wind, blow snow,  I'll keep warm.\"    It blew wind, but it did not blow snow. The day remained cold, but the  air undoubtedly had a touch of damp.    \"It may rain, and I'm sure the night will be dark,\" said Obed. \"We may  have our chance. Fortune favors those who help themselves.\"    The country became more broken, and the patches of scrub forest  increased in number. Often the three rode quite near to Urrea's men and  observed them closely. The Mexicans were moving slowly, and, as the  Americans had foreseen, discipline was relaxed greatly.    Near night drops of rain began to fall in their faces, and the sun set  among clouds. The three rejoiced. A night, dark and wet, had come sooner  than they had hoped. Obed and Ned also took out serapes, and wrapped  them around their shoulders. They served now not only to protect their  bodies, but to keep their firearms dry as well. Then they tethered their  horses among thorn bushes about a mile from Urrea's camp, and advanced  on foot.    They saw the camp fire glimmering feebly through the night, and they  advanced boldly. It was so dark now that a human figure fifty feet away  blended with the dusk, and the ground, softened by the rain, gave back  no sound of footsteps. Nevertheless they saw on their right a field  which showed a few signs of cultivation, and they surmised that Urrea  had made his camp at the lone hut of some peon.    They reckoned right. They came to clumps of trees, and in an opening  inclosed by them was a low adobe hut, from the open door of which a  light shone. They knew that Urrea and his officers had taken refuge  there from the rain and cold and, under the boughs of the trees or  beside the fire, they saw the rest of the band sheltering themselves as  best they could. The prisoners, their hands bound, were in a group in  the open, where the slow, cold rain fell steadily upon them. Ned's heart  swelled with rage at the sight.    Order and discipline seemed to be lacking. Men came and went as they  pleased. Fully twenty of them were making a shelter of canvas and thatch  beside the hut. Others began to build the fire higher in order to fend  off the wet and cold. Ned did not see that the chance of a rescue was  improved, but the Panther felt a sudden glow when his eyes alighted upon  something dark at the edge of the woods. A tiny shed stood there and his  keen eyes marked what was beneath it.    \"What do you think we'd better do, Panther?\" asked Obed.    \"No roarin' jest now. We mustn't raise our voices above whispers, but  we'll go back in the brush and wait. In an hour or two all these  Mexicans will be asleep. Like as not the sentinels, if they post any,  will be asleep first.\"    They withdrew deeper into the thickets, where they remained close  together. They saw the fire die in the Mexican camp. After a while all  sounds there ceased, and again they crept near. The Panther was a  genuine prophet, known and recognized by his comrades. Urrea's men,  having finished their shelters, were now asleep, including all the  sentinels except two. There was some excuse for them. They were in their  own country, far from any Texan force of importance, and the night could  scarcely have been worse. It was very dark, and the cold rain fell with  a steadiness and insistence that sought and finally found every opening  in one's clothing. Even the stalking three drew their serapes closer,  and shivered a little.    The two sentinels who did not sleep were together on the south side of  the glade. Evidently they wished the company of each other. They were  now some distance from the dark little shed toward which the Panther was  leading his comrades, and their whole energies were absorbed in an  attempt to light two cigarritos, which would soothe and strengthen them  as they kept their rainy and useless watch.    The three completed the segment of the circle and reached the little  shed which had become such an object of importance to the Panther.    \"Don't you see?\" said the Panther, his grim joy showing in his tone.    They saw, and they shared his satisfaction. The Mexicans had stacked  their rifles and muskets under the shed, where they would be protected  from the rain.    \"It's queer what foolish things men do in war,\" said Obed. \"Whom the  gods would destroy they first deprive of the sense of danger. They do  not dream that Richard, meaning the Panther, is in the chaparral.\"    \"If we approach this shed from the rear the sentinels, even if they  look, will not be able to see us,\" said the Panther. \"By the great horn  spoon, what an opportunity! I can hardly keep from roarin' an' ravin'  about it. Now, boys, we'll take away their guns, swift an' quiet.\"    A few trips apiece and all the rifles and muskets with their ammunition  were carried deep into the chaparral, where Obed, gladly sacrificing his  own comfort, covered them against the rain with his serape. Not a sign  had come meanwhile from the two sentinels on the far side of the camp.  Ned once or twice saw the lighted ends of their cigarritos glowing like  sparks in the darkness, but the outlines of the men's figures were very  dusky.    \"An' now for the riskiest part of our job, the one that counts the  most,\" said the Panther, \"the one that will make everything else a  failure if it falls through. We've got to secure the prisoners.\"    The captives were lying under the boughs of some trees about twenty  yards from the spot where the fire had been built. The pitiless rain had  beaten upon them, but as far as Ned could judge they had gone to sleep,  doubtless through sheer exhaustion. The Panther's plan of action was  swift and comprehensive.    \"Boys,\" he said, \"I'm the best shot of us three. I don't say it in any  spirit of boastin', 'cause I've pulled trigger about every day for  thirty years, an' more'n once a hundred times in one day. Now you two  give me your rifles and I'll set here in the edge of the bushes, then  you go ahead as silent as you can an' cut the prisoners loose. If  there's an alarm I'll open fire with the three rifles and cover the  escape.\"    Handing the rifles to the Panther, the two slipped forward. It was a  grateful task to Ned. Again his heart swelled with wrath as he saw the  dark figures of the bound men lying on the ground in the rain. He  remembered the one who was youthful of face like himself and he sought  him. As he approached he made out a figure lying in a strained  position, and he was sure that it was the captive lad. A yard or two  more and he knew absolutely. He touched the boy on the shoulder,  whispered in his ear that it was a friend, and, with one sweep of his  knife, released his arms.    \"Crawl to the chaparral there,\" said Ned, in swift sharp tones, pointing  the way. \"Another friend is waiting at that point.\"    The boy, without a word, began to creep forward in a stiff and awkward  fashion. Ned turned to the next prisoner. It was the elderly man whom he  had seen from the chaparral, and he was wide awake, staring intently at  Ned.    \"Is it rescue?\" he whispered. \"Is it possible?\"    \"It is rescue. It is possible,\" replied Ned, in a similar whisper. \"Turn  a little to one side and I will cut the cords that bind you.\"    The man turned, but when Ned freed him he whispered:    \"You will have to help me. I cannot yet walk alone. Urrea has already  given me a taste of what I was to expect.\"    Ned shuddered. There was a terrible significance in the prisoner's tone.  He assisted him to rise partly, but the man staggered. It was evident  that he could not walk. He must help this man, but the others were  waiting to be released also. Then the good thought came.    \"Wait a moment,\" he said, and he cut the bonds of another man.    \"Now you help your friend there,\" he said.    He saw the two going away together, and he turned to the others. He and  Obed worked fast, and within five minutes the last man was released. But  as they crept back toward the chaparral the slack sentinels caught  sight of the dusky figures retreating. Two musket shots were fired and  there were rapid shouts in Mexican jargon. Ned and Obed rose to their  feet and, keeping the escaped prisoners before them, ran for the  thickets.    A terrific reply to the Mexican alarm came from the forest. A volley of  rifle and pistol shots was fired among the soldiers as they sprang to  their feet and a tremendous voice roared:    \"At 'em, boys! At 'em! Charge 'em! Now is your time! Rip an' t'ar an'  roar an' chaw! Don't let a single one escape! Sweep the scum off the  face of the earth!\"    The Ring Tailed Panther had a mighty voice, issuing from a mighty  throat. Never had he used it in greater volume or to better purpose than  on that night. The forest fairly thundered with the echoes of the battle  cry, and as the dazed Mexicans rushed for their guns only to find them  gone, they thought that the whole Texan army was upon them. In another  instant a new terror struck at their hearts. Their horses and mules,  driven in a frightful stampede, suddenly rushed into the glade and they  were now busy"]]]
