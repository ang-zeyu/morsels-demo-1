Look, here comes the Duke.\"    \"With his eyes full of anger,\" said Celia.    \"You must leave the Court at once,\" he said to Rosalind. \"Why?\" she  asked.    \"Never mind why,\" answered the Duke, \"you are banished. If within ten  days you are found within twenty miles of my Court, you die.\"    So Rosalind set out to seek her father, the banished Duke, in the Forest  of Arden. Celia loved her too much to let her go alone, and as it was  rather a dangerous journey, Rosalind, being the taller, dressed up as  a young countryman, and her cousin as a country girl, and Rosalind said  that she would be called Ganymede, and Celia, Aliena. They were very  tired when at last they came to the Forest of Arden, and as they were  sitting on the grass a countryman passed that way, and Ganymede  asked him if he could get them food. He did so, and told them that  a shepherd's flocks and house were to be sold. They bought these and  settled down as shepherd and shepherdess in the forest.    In the meantime, Oliver having sought to take his brother Orlando's  life, Orlando also wandered into the forest, and there met with the  rightful Duke, and being kindly received, stayed with him. Now, Orlando  could think of nothing but Rosalind, and he went about the forest  carving her name on trees, and writing love sonnets and hanging them on  the bushes, and there Rosalind and Celia found them. One day Orlando met  them, but he did not know Rosalind in her boy's clothes, though he liked  the pretty shepherd youth, because he fancied a likeness in him to her  he loved.    \"There is a foolish lover,\" said Rosalind, \"who haunts these woods and  hangs sonnets on the trees. If I could find him, I would soon cure him  of his folly.\"    Orlando confessed that he was the foolish lover, and Rosalind said--\"If  you will come and see me every day, I will pretend to be Rosalind, and I  will take her part, and be wayward and contrary, as is the way of women,  till I make you ashamed of your folly in loving her.\"    And so every day he went to her house, and took a pleasure in saying to  her all the pretty things he would have said to Rosalind; and she had  the fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love-words came to the  right ears. Thus many days passed pleasantly away.    One morning, as Orlando was going to visit Ganymede, he saw a man asleep  on the ground, and that there was a lioness crouching near, waiting for  the man who was asleep to wake: for they say that lions will not prey on  anything that is dead or sleeping. Then Orlando looked at the man, and  saw that it was his wicked brother, Oliver, who had tried to take his  life. He fought with the lioness and killed her, and saved his brother's  life.    While Orlando was fighting the lioness, Oliver woke to see his brother,  whom he had treated so badly, saving him from a wild beast at the risk  of his own life. This made him repent of his wickedness, and he begged  Orlando's pardon, and from thenceforth they were dear brothers. The  lioness had wounded Orlando's arm so much, that he could not go on to  see the shepherd, so he sent his brother to ask Ganymede to come to him.    Oliver went and told the whole story to Ganymede and Aliena, and Aliena  was so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults, that she  fell in love with him at once. But when Ganymede heard of the danger  Orlando had been in she fainted; and when she came to herself, said  truly enough, \"I should have been a woman by right.\"    Oliver went back to his brother and told him all this, saying, \"I love  Aliena so well that I will give up my estates to you and marry her, and  live here as a shepherd.\"    \"Let your wedding be to-morrow,\" said Orlando, \"and I will ask the Duke  and his friends.\"    When Orlando told Ganymede how his brother was to be married on the  morrow, he added: \"Oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness  through another man's eyes.\"    Then answered Rosalind, still in Ganymede's dress and speaking with his  voic--\"If you do love Rosalind so near the heart, then when your brother  marries Aliena, shall you marry her.\"    Now the next day the Duke and his followers, and Orlando, and Oliver,  and Aliena, were all gathered together for the wedding.    Then Ganymede came in and said to the Duke, \"If I bring in your daughter  Rosalind, will you give her to Orlando here?\" \"That I would,\" said the  Duke, \"if I had all kingdoms to give with her.\"    \"And you say you will have her when I bring her?\" she said to Orlando.  \"That would I,\" he answered, \"were I king of all kingdoms.\"    Then Rosalind and Celia went out, and Rosalind put on her pretty woman's  clothes again, and after a while came back.    She turned to her father--\"I give myself to you, for I am yours.\" \"If  there be truth in sight,\" he said, \"you are my daughter.\"    Then she said to Orlando, \"I give myself to you, for I am yours.\" \"If  there be truth in sight,\" he said, \"you are my Rosalind.\"    \"I will have no father if you be not he,\" she said to the Duke, and to  Orlando, \"I will have no husband if you be not he.\"    So Orlando and Rosalind were married, and Oliver and Celia, and they  lived happy ever after, returning with the Duke to the kingdom. For  Frederick had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways,  and so gave back the dukedom of his brother, and himself went into a  monastery to pray for forgiveness.    The wedding was a merry one, in the mossy glades of the forest. A  shepherd and shepherdess who had been friends with Rosalind, when she  was herself disguised as a shepherd, were married on the same day, and  all with such pretty feastings and merrymakings as could be nowhere  within four walls, but only in the beautiful green wood.          THE WINTER'S TALE        Leontes was the King of Sicily, and his dearest friend was Polixenes,  King of Bohemia. They had been brought up together, and only separated  when they reached man's estate and each had to go and rule over  his kingdom. After many years, when each was married and had a son,  Polixenes came to stay with Leontes in Sicily.    Leontes was a violent-tempered man and rather silly, and he took it into  his stupid head that his wife, Hermione, liked Polixenes better than  she did him, her own husband. When once he had got this into his head,  nothing could put it out; and he ordered one of his lords, Camillo, to  put a poison in Polixenes' wine. Camillo tried to dissuade him from this  wicked action, but finding he was not to be moved, pretended to consent.  He then told Polixenes what was proposed against him, and they fled from  the Court of Sicily that night, and returned to Bohemia, where Camillo  lived on as Polixenes' friend and counselor.    Leontes threw the Queen into prison; and her son, the heir to the  throne, died of sorrow to see his mother so unjustly and cruelly  treated.    While the Queen was in prison she had a little baby, and a friend of  hers, named Paulina, had the baby dressed in its best, and took it to  show the King, thinking that the sight of his helpless little daughter  would soften his heart towards his dear Queen, who had never done him  any wrong, and who loved him a great deal more than he deserved; but the  King would not look at the baby, and ordered Paulina's husband to take  it away in a ship, and leave it in the most desert and dreadful place  he could find, which Paulina's husband, very much against his will, was  obliged to do.    Then the poor Queen was brought up to be tried for treason in preferring  Polixenes to her King; but really she had never thought of anyone except  Leontes, her husband. Leontes had sent some messengers to ask the god,  Apollo, whether he was not right in his cruel thoughts of the Queen. But  he had not patience to wait till they came back, and so it happened that  they arrived in the middle of the trial. The Oracle said--    \"Hermione is innocent, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject,  Leontes a jealous tyrant, and the King shall live without an heir, if  that which is lost be not found.\"    Then a man came and told them that the little Prince was dead. The  poor Queen, hearing this, fell down in a fit; and then the King saw how  wicked and wrong he had been. He ordered Paulina and the ladies who were  with the Queen to take her away, and try to restore her. But Paulina  came back in a few moments, and told the King that Hermione was dead.    Now Leontes' eyes were at last opened to his folly. His Queen was dead,  and the little daughter who might have been a comfort to him he had sent  away to be the prey of wolves and kites. Life had nothing left for him  now. He gave himself up to his grief, and passed in any sad years in  prayer and remorse.    The baby Princess was left on the seacoast of Bohemia, the very kingdom  where Polixenes reigned. Paulina's husband never went home to tell  Leontes where he had left the baby; for as he was going back to the  ship, he met a bear and was torn to pieces. So there was an end of him.    But the poor deserted little baby was found by a shepherd. She was  richly dressed, and had with her some jewels, and a paper was pinned to  her cloak, saying that her name was Perdita, and that she came of noble  parents.    The shepherd, being a kind-hearted man, took home the little baby to  his wife, and they brought it up as their own child. She had no more  teaching than a shepherd's child generally has, but she inherited from  her royal mother many graces and charms, so that she was quite different  from the other maidens in the village where she lived.    One day Prince Florizel, the son of the good King of Bohemia, was  bunting near the shepherd's house and saw Perdita, now grown up to a  charming woman. He made friends with the shepherd, not telling him that  he was the Prince, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#5)"],[1,"distinguished himself by his  application to mathematics: knows history and geography passably: very  weak in accomplishments. He will be an excellent seaman: is worthy to  enter the School at Paris.\" To the military school at Paris he was  accordingly sent in due course, entering there in October, 1784. The  change from the semi-monastic life at Brienne to the splendid edifice  which fronts the Champ de Mars had less effect than might have  been expected in a youth of fifteen years. Not yet did he become  French in sympathy. His love of Corsica and hatred of the French  monarchy steeled him against the luxuries of his new surroundings.  Perhaps it was an added sting that he was educated at the expense of  the monarchy which had conquered his kith and kin. He nevertheless  applied himself with energy to his favourite studies, especially  mathematics. Defective in languages he still was, and ever remained;  for his critical acumen in literature ever fastened on the matter  rather than on style. To the end of his days he could never write  Italian, much less French, with accuracy; and his tutor at Paris not  inaptly described his boyish composition as resembling molten granite.  The same qualities of directness and impetuosity were also fatal to  his efforts at mastering the movements of the dance. In spite of  lessons at Paris and private lessons which he afterwards took at  Valence, he was never a dancer: his bent was obviously for the exact  sciences rather than the arts, for the geometrical rather than the  rhythmical: he thought, as he moved, in straight lines, never in  curves.    The death of his father during the year which the youth spent at Paris  sharpened his sense of responsibility towards his seven younger  brothers and sisters. His own poverty must have inspired him with  disgust at the luxury which he saw around him; but there are good  reasons for doubting the genuineness of the memorial which he is  alleged to have sent from Paris to the second master at Brienne on  this subject. The letters of the scholars at Paris were subject to  strict surveillance; and, if he had taken the trouble to draw up a  list of criticisms on his present training, most assuredly it would  have been destroyed. Undoubtedly, however, he would have sympathized  with the unknown critic in his complaint of the unsuitableness of  sumptuous meals to youths who were destined for the hardships of the  camp. At Brienne he had been dubbed \"the Spartan,\" an instance of that  almost uncanny faculty of schoolboys to dash off in a nickname the  salient features of character. The phrase was correct, almost for  Napoleon's whole life. At any rate, the pomp of Paris served but to  root his youthful affections more tenaciously in the rocks of Corsica.    In September, 1785, that is, at the age of sixteen, Buonaparte was  nominated for a commission as junior lieutenant in La Fere regiment of  artillery quartered at Valence on the Rhone. This was his first close  contact with real life. The rules of the service required him to  spend three months of rigorous drill before he was admitted to his  commission. The work was exacting: the pay was small, viz., 1,120  francs, or less than L45, a year; but all reports agree as to his keen  zest for his profession and the recognition of his transcendent  abilities by his superior officers.[8] There it was that he mastered  the rudiments of war, for lack of which many generals of noble birth  have quickly closed in disaster careers that began with promise:  there, too, he learnt that hardest and best of all lessons, prompt  obedience. \"To learn obeying is the fundamental art of governing,\"  says Carlyle. It was so with Napoleon: at Valence he served his  apprenticeship in the art of conquering and the art of governing.    This spring-time of his life is of interest and importance in many  ways: it reveals many amiable qualities, which had hitherto been  blighted by the real or fancied scorn of the wealthy cadets. At  Valence, while shrinking from his brother officers, he sought society  more congenial to his simple tastes and restrained demeanour. In a few  of the best bourgeois families of Valence he found happiness. There,  too, blossomed the tenderest, purest idyll of his life. At the country  house of a cultured lady who had befriended him in his solitude, he  saw his first love, Caroline de Colombier. It was a passing fancy;  but to her all the passion of his southern nature welled forth. She  seems to have returned his love; for in the stormy sunset of his life  at St. Helena he recalled some delicious walks at dawn when Caroline  and he had--eaten cherries together. One lingers fondly over these  scenes of his otherwise stern career, for they reveal his capacity for  social joys and for deep and tender affection, had his lot been  otherwise cast. How different might have been his life, had France  never conquered Corsica, and had the Revolution never burst forth! But  Corsica was still his dominant passion. When he was called away from  Valence to repress a riot at Lyons, his feelings, distracted for a  time by Caroline, swerved back towards his island home; and in  September, 1786, he had the joy of revisiting the scenes of his  childhood. Warmly though he greeted his mother, brothers and sisters,  after an absence of nearly eight years, his chief delight was in the  rocky shores, the verdant dales and mountain heights of Corsica. The  odour of the forests, the setting of the sun in the sea \"as in the  bosom of the infinite,\" the quiet proud independence of the  mountaineers themselves, all enchanted him. His delight reveals almost  Wertherian powers of \"sensibility.\" Even the family troubles could not  damp his ardour. His father had embarked on questionable speculations,  which now threatened the Buonapartes with bankruptcy, unless the  French Government proved to be complacent and generous. With the hope  of pressing one of the family claims on the royal exchequer, the  second son procured an extension of furlough and sped to Paris. There  at the close of 1787 he spent several weeks, hopefully endeavouring to  extract money from the bankrupt Government. It was a season of  disillusionment in more senses than one; for there he saw for himself  the seamy side of Parisian life, and drifted for a brief space about  the giddy vortex of the Palais Royal. What a contrast to the limpid  life of Corsica was that turbid frothy existence--already swirling  towards its mighty plunge!    After a furlough of twenty-one months he rejoined his regiment, now at  Auxonne. There his health suffered considerably, not only from the  miasma of the marshes of the river Saone, but also from family  anxieties and arduous literary toils. To these last it is now needful  to refer. Indeed, the external events of his early life are of value  only as they reveal the many-sidedness of his nature and the growth of  his mental powers.    How came he to outgrow the insular patriotism of his early years? The  foregoing recital of facts must have already suggested one obvious  explanation. Nature had dowered him so prodigally with diverse gifts,  mainly of an imperious order, that he could scarcely have limited his  sphere of action to Corsica. Profoundly as he loved his island, it  offered no sphere commensurate with his varied powers and masterful  will. It was no empty vaunt which his father had uttered on his  deathbed that his Napoleon would one day overthrow the old monarchies  and conquer Europe.[9] Neither did the great commander himself  overstate the peculiarity of his temperament, when he confessed that  his instincts had ever prompted him that his will must prevail, and  that what pleased him must of necessity belong to him. Most spoilt  children harbour the same illusion, for a brief space. But all the  buffetings of fortune failed to drive it from the young Buonaparte;  and when despair as to his future might have impaired the vigour of  his domineering instincts, his mind and will acquired a fresh rigidity  by coming under the spell of that philosophizing doctrinaire,  Rousseau.    There was every reason why he should early be attracted by this  fantastic thinker. In that notable work, \"Le Contrat Social\" (1762),  Rousseau called attention to the antique energy shown by the Corsicans  in defence of their liberties, and in a startlingly prophetic phrase  he exclaimed that the little island would one day astonish Europe. The  source of this predilection of Rousseau for Corsica is patent. Born  and reared at Geneva, he felt a Switzer's love for a people which was<  \"neither rich nor poor but self-sufficing \"; and in the simple life  and fierce love of liberty of the hardy islanders he saw traces of  that social contract which he postulated as the basis of society.  According to him, the beginnings of all social and political  institutions are to be found in some agreement or contract between  men. Thus arise the clan, the tribe, the nation. The nation may  delegate many of its powers to a ruler; but if he abuse such powers,  the contract between him and his people is at an end, and they may  return to the primitive state, which is founded on an agreement of  equals with equals. Herein lay the attractiveness of Rousseau for all  who were discontented with their surroundings. He seemed infallibly  to demonstrate the absurdity of tyranny and the need of returning to  the primitive bliss of the social contract. It mattered not that the  said contract was utterly unhistorical and that his argument teemed  with fallacies. He inspired a whole generation with detestation of the  present and with longings for the golden age. Poets had sung of it,  but Rousseau seemed to bring it within the grasp of long-suffering  mortals.    The first extant manuscript of Napoleon, written at Valence in April,  1786, shows that he sought in Rousseau's armoury the logical weapons  for demonstrating the \"right\" of the Corsicans to"]]]
