No, I went into the country.    Did you walk into the city yesterday?    No, I went the day before.        ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS.    Sometimes a word is emphasized simply to indicate the importance of the  idea. This is called absolute emphasis.    EXAMPLES.      To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!    Woe unto you, PHARISEES! HYPOCRITES!    Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away.    REMARK.--In instances like the last, it is sometimes called the emphasis  of specification.        RELATIVE EMPHASIS.    Words are often emphasized in order to exhibit the idea they express as  compared or contrasted with some other idea. This is called relative  emphasis.    EXAMPLES.    A friend can not be known in prosperity; an enemy can not be hidden in  adversity.    It is much better to be injured than to injure.    REMARK.--In many instances one part only of the antithesis is expressed,  the corresponding idea being understood; as,                A friendly eye would never see such faults.    Here the unfriendly eye is understood.    King Henry exclaims, while vainly endeavoring to compose  himself to rest,      \"How many thousand of my poorest subjects    Are at this hour asleep!\"    Here the emphatic words thousand, subjects, and asleep are contrasted in  idea with their opposites, and if the contrasted ideas were expressed it  might be in this way:      While I alone, their sovereign, am doomed to wakefulness.        EMPHATIC PHRASE.    Sometimes several words in succession are emphasized, forming what is  called an emphatic phrase.    EXAMPLES.    Shall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and not only of the Alpine  nations but of the Alps themselves--shall I compare myself with this  HALF--YEAR--CAPTAIN?    Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the LAST TEN  YEARS.      And if thou said'st I am not peer    To any lord in Scotland here,    Lowland or Highland, far or near,    Lord Angus-THOU-HAST-LIED!    EMPHATIC PAUSE.    The emphatic expression of a sentence often requires a pause where the  grammatical construction authorizes none. This is sometimes called the  rhetorical pause. Such pauses occur chiefly before or after an emphatic  word or phrase, and sometimes both before and after it.    EXAMPLES.    Rise--fellow-men! our country--yet remains!  By that dread name we wave the sword on high,  And swear for her--to live--with her--to die.    But most--by numbers judge the poet's song:  And smooth or rough, with them is--right or wrong.    He said; then full before their sight  Produced the beast, and lo!--'t was white.        VI. MODULATION.    Modulation includes the variations of the voice. These may be classed  under the heads of Pitch, Compass, Quantity, and Quality.    PITCH AND COMPASS.    If anyone will notice closely a sentence as uttered in private  conversation, he will observe that very few successive words are  pronounced in exactly the same key or with the same force. At the same  time, however, there is a certain PITCH or key, which seems, on the whole,  to prevail.    This keynote, or governing note, as it may be called, is that upon which  the voice most frequently dwells, to which it usually returns when  wearied, and upon which a sentence generally commences, and very  frequently ends, while, at the same time, there is a considerable play of  the voice above and below it.    This key may be high or low. It varies in different individuals, and at  different times in the same individual, being governed by the nature of  the subject and the emotions of the speaker. It is worthy of notice,  however, that most speakers pitch their voices on a key too high.    The range of the voice above and below this note is called its COMPASS.  When the speaker is animated, this range is great; but upon abstract  subjects, or with a dull speaker, it is small. If, in reading or speaking,  too high a note be chosen, the lungs will soon become wearied; if too low  a pitch be selected, there is danger of indistinctness of utterance; and  in either case there is less room for compass or variety of tone than if  one be taken between the two extremes.    To secure the proper pitch and the greatest compass observe the following  rule:    RULE XII.--The reader or speaker should choose that pitch in which he can  feel himself most at ease, and above and below which he may have most room  for variation.    REMARK 1.--Having chosen the proper keynote, he should beware of confining  himself to it. This constitutes monotony, one of the greatest faults in  elocution. One very important instrument for giving expression and life to  thought is thus lost, and the hearer soon becomes wearied and disgusted.    REMARK 2.--There is another fault of nearly equal magnitude, and of very  frequent occurrence. This consists in varying the pitch and force without  reference to the sense. A sentence is commenced with vehemence and in a  high key, and the voice gradually sinks until, the breath being spent, it  dies away in a whisper.    NOTE--The power of changing the key at will is difficult to acquire, but  of great importance.    REMARK 3.--The habit of singsong, so common in reading poetry, as it is a  variation of pitch without reference to the sense, is a species of the  fault above mentioned.    REMARK 4.--If the reader or speaker is guided by the sense, and if he  gives that emphasis, inflection, and expression required by the meaning,  these faults speedily disappear.    REMARK 5.--To improve the voice in these respects, practice is necessary.  Commence, for example, with the lowest pitch the voice can comfortably  sound, and repeat whole paragraphs and pages upon that key with gentle  force. Then repeat the paragraph with increased force, taking care not to  raise the pitch. Then rise one note higher, and practice on that, then  another, and so on, until the highest pitch of the voice is reached.  Reverse the process, and repeat as before until the lowest pitch is  obtained.    NOTE.--In these and all similar exercises, be very careful not to  confound pitch and force.        QUANTITY AND QUALITY.    The tones of the voice should vary also in quantity, or time required to  utter a sound or a syllable, and in quality, or expression, according to  the nature of the subject.    REMARK.--We notice a difference between the soft, insinuating tones of  persuasion; the full, strong voice of command and decision; the harsh,  irregular, and sometimes grating explosion of the sounds of passion; the  plaintive notes of sorrow and pity; and the equable and unimpassioned flow  of words in argumentative style.    The following direction, therefore, is worthy of attention:    The tones of the voice should always correspond both in quantity and  quality with the nature of the subject.    EXAMPLES.    Passion and Grief       \"Come back! come back!\" he cried, in grief.     \"Across this stormy water,     And I'll forgive your Highland chief,        My daughter! O, my daughter!\"      Plaintive    I have lived long enough: my way of life    Is fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf:    And that which should accompany old age,    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,    I must not look to have.      Calm     A very great portion of this globe is covered  with water, which is     called sea, and is very distinct from rivers and lakes.      Fierce Anger      Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire,    And shook his very frame for ire,          And--\"This to me?\" he said;       \"And 't were not for thy hoary beard,    Such hand as Marmion's had not spared       To cleave the Douglas' head!      Loud and Explosive         \"Even in thy pitch of pride,    Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near,        I tell thee thou 'rt defied!    And if thou said'st I am not peer    To any lord in Scotland here,    Lowland or Highland, far or near,    Lord Angus, thou hast lied '\"      REMARK 1.--In our attempt to imitate nature it is important to avoid  affectation, for to this fault even perfect monotony is preferable.    REMARK 2.--The strength of the voice may be increased by practicing with  different degrees of loudness, from a whisper to full rotundity, taking  care to keep the voice on the same key. The same note in music may be  sounded loud or soft. So also a sentence may be pronounced on the same  pitch with different degrees of loudness. Having practiced with different  degrees of loudness on one key, make the same experiment on another, and  then on another, and so on. This will also give the learner practice in  compass,        VII. POETIC PAUSES.    In poetry we have, in addition to other pauses, poetic pauses. The object  of these is simply to promote the melody.    At the end of each line a slight pause is proper, whatever be the  grammatical construction or the sense. The purpose of this pause is to  make prominent the melody of the measure, and in rhyme to allow the ear to  appreciate the harmony of the similar sounds.    There is, also, another important pause, somewhere near the middle of each  line, which is called the caesura or caesural pause. In the following  lines it is marked thus (||):    EXAMPLES.      There are hours long departed || which memory brings,      Like blossoms of Eden || to twine round the heart,    And as time rushes by || on the might of his wings,      They may darken awhile || but they never depart.    REMARK.--The caesural pause should never be so placed as to injure the  sense. The following lines, if melody alone were consulted, would be read  thus:      With fruitless la || bor Clara bound,    And strove to stanch || the gushing wound;    The Monk with un || availing cares,    Exhausted all || the church's prayers.    This manner of reading, however, would very much interfere with the proper  expression of the idea. This is to be corrected by making the caesural  pause yield to the sense. The above lines should be read thus:      With fruitless labor || Clara bound,"]]]
