Do we imagine  that the wicked are suffering torments, or that the good are singing the  praises of God, during a period longer than that of a whole life, or  of ten lives of men? Is the suffering physical or mental? And does the  worship of God consist only of praise, or of many forms of service? Who  are the wicked, and who are the good, whom we venture to divide by a  hard and fast line; and in which of the two classes should we place  ourselves and our friends? May we not suspect that we are making  differences of kind, because we are unable to imagine differences  of degree?--putting the whole human race into heaven or hell for the  greater convenience of logical division? Are we not at the same time  describing them both in superlatives, only that we may satisfy the  demands of rhetoric? What is that pain which does not become deadened  after a thousand years? or what is the nature of that pleasure or  happiness which never wearies by monotony? Earthly pleasures and pains  are short in proportion as they are keen; of any others which are both  intense and lasting we have no experience, and can form no idea.  The words or figures of speech which we use are not consistent with  themselves. For are we not imagining Heaven under the similitude of  a church, and Hell as a prison, or perhaps a madhouse or chamber of  horrors? And yet to beings constituted as we are, the monotony of  singing psalms would be as great an infliction as the pains of hell,  and might be even pleasantly interrupted by them. Where are the actions  worthy of rewards greater than those which are conferred on the greatest  benefactors of mankind? And where are the crimes which according to  Plato's merciful reckoning,--more merciful, at any rate, than the  eternal damnation of so-called Christian teachers,--for every ten years  in this life deserve a hundred of punishment in the life to come?  We should be ready to die of pity if we could see the least of the  sufferings which the writers of Infernos and Purgatorios have attributed  to the damned. Yet these joys and terrors seem hardly to exercise an  appreciable influence over the lives of men. The wicked man when old,  is not, as Plato supposes (Republic), more agitated by the terrors of  another world when he is nearer to them, nor the good in an ecstasy at  the joys of which he is soon to be the partaker. Age numbs the sense of  both worlds; and the habit of life is strongest in death. Even the dying  mother is dreaming of her lost children as they were forty or fifty  years before, 'pattering over the boards,' not of reunion with them  in another state of being. Most persons when the last hour comes are  resigned to the order of nature and the will of God. They are not  thinking of Dante's Inferno or Paradiso, or of the Pilgrim's Progress.  Heaven and hell are not realities to them, but words or ideas; the  outward symbols of some great mystery, they hardly know what. Many  noble poems and pictures have been suggested by the traditional  representations of them, which have been fixed in forms of art and can  no longer be altered. Many sermons have been filled with descriptions  of celestial or infernal mansions. But hardly even in childhood did the  thought of heaven and hell supply the motives of our actions, or at any  time seriously affect the substance of our belief.    8. Another life must be described, if at all, in forms of thought  and not of sense. To draw pictures of heaven and hell, whether in the  language of Scripture or any other, adds nothing to our real knowledge,  but may perhaps disguise our ignorance. The truest conception which  we can form of a future life is a state of progress or education--a  progress from evil to good, from ignorance to knowledge. To this we are  led by the analogy of the present life, in which we see different races  and nations of men, and different men and women of the same nation,  in various states or stages of cultivation; some more and some less  developed, and all of them capable of improvement under favourable  circumstances. There are punishments too of children when they are  growing up inflicted by their parents, of elder offenders which are  imposed by the law of the land, of all men at all times of life,  which are attached by the laws of nature to the performance of certain  actions. All these punishments are really educational; that is to say,  they are not intended to retaliate on the offender, but to teach him  a lesson. Also there is an element of chance in them, which is another  name for our ignorance of the laws of nature. There is evil too  inseparable from good (compare Lysis); not always punished here, as good  is not always rewarded. It is capable of being indefinitely diminished;  and as knowledge increases, the element of chance may more and more  disappear.    For we do not argue merely from the analogy of the present state of this  world to another, but from the analogy of a probable future to which we  are tending. The greatest changes of which we have had experience as yet  are due to our increasing knowledge of history and of nature. They  have been produced by a few minds appearing in three or four favoured  nations, in a comparatively short period of time. May we be allowed to  imagine the minds of men everywhere working together during many ages  for the completion of our knowledge? May not the science of physiology  transform the world? Again, the majority of mankind have really  experienced some moral improvement; almost every one feels that he has  tendencies to good, and is capable of becoming better. And these germs  of good are often found to be developed by new circumstances, like  stunted trees when transplanted to a better soil. The differences  between the savage and the civilized man, or between the civilized  man in old and new countries, may be indefinitely increased. The first  difference is the effect of a few thousand, the second of a few hundred  years. We congratulate ourselves that slavery has become industry;  that law and constitutional government have superseded despotism and  violence; that an ethical religion has taken the place of Fetichism.  There may yet come a time when the many may be as well off as the few;  when no one will be weighed down by excessive toil; when the necessity  of providing for the body will not interfere with mental improvement;  when the physical frame may be strengthened and developed; and the  religion of all men may become a reasonable service.    Nothing therefore, either in the present state of man or in the  tendencies of the future, as far as we can entertain conjecture of them,  would lead us to suppose that God governs us vindictively in this  world, and therefore we have no reason to infer that he will govern us  vindictively in another. The true argument from analogy is not, 'This  life is a mixed state of justice and injustice, of great waste, of  sudden casualties, of disproportionate punishments, and therefore the  like inconsistencies, irregularities, injustices are to be expected  in another;' but 'This life is subject to law, and is in a state of  progress, and therefore law and progress may be believed to be the  governing principles of another.' All the analogies of this world would  be against unmeaning punishments inflicted a hundred or a thousand years  after an offence had been committed. Suffering there might be as a  part of education, but not hopeless or protracted; as there might be  a retrogression of individuals or of bodies of men, yet not such as to  interfere with a plan for the improvement of the whole (compare Laws.)    9. But some one will say: That we cannot reason from the seen to the  unseen, and that we are creating another world after the image of this,  just as men in former ages have created gods in their own likeness. And  we, like the companions of Socrates, may feel discouraged at hearing  our favourite 'argument from analogy' thus summarily disposed of. Like  himself, too, we may adduce other arguments in which he seems to have  anticipated us, though he expresses them in different language. For we  feel that the soul partakes of the ideal and invisible; and can never  fall into the error of confusing the external circumstances of man with  his higher self; or his origin with his nature. It is as repugnant to  us as it was to him to imagine that our moral ideas are to be attributed  only to cerebral forces. The value of a human soul, like the value of a  man's life to himself, is inestimable, and cannot be reckoned in earthly  or material things. The human being alone has the consciousness of truth  and justice and love, which is the consciousness of God. And the soul  becoming more conscious of these, becomes more conscious of her own  immortality.    10. The last ground of our belief in immortality, and the strongest, is  the perfection of the divine nature. The mere fact of the existence of  God does not tend to show the continued existence of man. An evil God  or an indifferent God might have had the power, but not the will, to  preserve us. He might have regarded us as fitted to minister to his  service by a succession of existences,--like the animals, without  attributing to each soul an incomparable value. But if he is perfect,  he must will that all rational beings should partake of that perfection  which he himself is. In the words of the Timaeus, he is good, and  therefore he desires that all other things should be as like himself as  possible. And the manner in which he accomplishes this is by permitting  evil, or rather degrees of good, which are otherwise called evil.  For all progress is good relatively to the past, and yet may be  comparatively evil when regarded in the light of the future. Good and  evil are relative terms, and degrees of evil are merely the negative  aspect of degrees of good. Of the absolute goodness of any finite nature  we can form no conception; we are all of us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],[0,"History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#5)"],[1,"ermans. Being of the disposition he was, it is very likely  that the Kaiser found it difficult to bend him completely to his will.  Being a stumbling block in the way of German aims, is it not reasonably  probable that Germany desired to get rid of him, thus leaving  Austria-Hungary completely in the power of its tool and puppet, Francis  Joseph, and in the event of his death, in the power of the young and  suppliant Karl; another instrument easily bent to the German will?    The wife of the archduke, assassinated with him, was a Bohemian, her  maiden name being Sophie Chotek. She was not of noble blood as Bohemia  had no nobles. They had been driven out of the country centuries before  and their titles and estates conferred on indigent Spanish and Austrian  adventurers. Not being of noble birth, she was but the morgantic wife of  the Austrian heir. Titles were afterwards conferred upon her. She was  made a countess and then a duchess. Some say she had been an actress;  not unlikely, for actresses possessed an especial appeal to Austrian  royalty. The cruel Hapsburgs rendered dull witted and inefficient by  generations of inbreeding, were fascinated by the bright and handsome  women of the stage. At any rate, Sophie Chotek belonged to that virile,  practical race Bohemians, (also called Czechs) that gave to the world  John Huss, who lighted the fires of religious and civil liberty in  Central Europe, giving advent later to the work of Martin Luther.    Bohemians had always been liberty-loving. They had been anxious for  three centuries to throw off the yoke of Austria. There is no record  that Sophie Chotek sympathized with the aims of her countrymen or that  she was not in complete accord with the views of her husband and the  political interests of the empire. But the experiences of the Germans  and Austrians had taught them that a Bohemian was likely to remain  always a Bohemian and that his freedom-loving people would not  countenance plans having in view the enslavement of other nations. The  Germans may have looked with suspicion upon the Bohemian wife of the  archduke and thought it advisable to remove her also.    Prinzip was thrown into prison and kept there until he died. No  statement he may have made ever had a chance to reach the world. No one  knows whether he was a German or a Serbian tool. He does not seem to  have been an anarchist; neither does he seem to have been of the type  that would commit such a crime voluntarily, knowing full well the  consequences. It is not hard to believe that he was under pay and  promised full protection.    Probably no Bohemian considers Sophie Chotek a martyr; indeed, the  evidence is strong that she was not. Her heart and soul probably were  with her royal spouse. But an interesting outcome is, that her  assassination, a contributing cause to the war, finally led to the  downfall of Germany, the wreck of Austria, the freedom of her native  country, and that Spiritual Emancipation of nations and races, then so  gloriously under way.    Also, to the thoughtful and philosophic observer of maturing symptoms  transpiring continuously in the affairs of mankind; the fate of those  nations of earth that in their strength and arrogance mock the Master,  furnish a striking corroborative vindication of the Negro's faith in the  promises of the Lord; the glory and power of His coming. From the date,  reckoning from moment and second, that Gavrio Prinzip done to death the  heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary and his duchess, there commenced  not alone a new day, a new hope and Emancipation of the whites of earth;  empire kingdom, principality and tribe, but of the blacks; the Negro as  well, so mysteriously; bewilderingly, moves God His wonders to perform.    It was that subliminated faith in the ubiquity and omniscience of God;  the unchangeableness of His word; than which the world has witnessed;  known nothing finer; the story of the concurrent causes that projected  the Negro into the World War, from whence he emerged covered with glory,  followed by the plaudits of mankind, that became the inspiration of this  work--his story of devotion, valor and patriotism; of unmurmuring  sacrifice; worthy the pens of the mighty, but which the historian, as  best he may will tell: \"NOTHING extenuate, nor set down AUGHT in  malice.\"          CHAPTER II    HANDWRITING ON THE WALL      Likened to Belshazzar--The Kaiser's Feasts--In His Heart Barbaric Pride  of the Potentates of Old--German Madness for War--Insolent  Demands--Forty-eight Hours to Prevent a World War--Comment of Statesmen  and Leaders--The War Starts--Italy Breaks Her Alliance--Germanic Powers  Weighed and Found Wanting--Spirit Wins Over Materialism--Civilization's  Lamp Dimmed but not Darkened.      Belshazzar of Babylon sat at a feast. Very much after the fashion of  modern kings they were good at feasting in those olden days. The  farthest limits of the kingdom had been searched for every delight and  delicacy. Honeyed wines, flamingo's tongues, game from the hills, fruits  from vine and tree, spices from grove and forest, vegetables from field  and garden, fish from stream and sea; every resource of Mother Earth  that could contribute to appetite or sensual pleasure was brought to the  king's table. Singers, minstrels, dancers, magicians, entertainers of  every description were summoned to the palace that they might contribute  to the vanity of the monarch, and impress the onlooking nations about  him.    He desired to be known and feared as the greatest monarch on earth;  ruling as he did over the world's greatest city. His triumphs had been  many. He had come to believe that his power proceeded directly from the  god Bel, and that he was the chosen and anointed of that deity.    This was the period of his prime; of Babylon's greatest glory; his  kingdom seemed so firmly established he had no thought it could be  shaken. But misleading are the dreams of kings; his kingdom was suddenly  menaced from without, by Cyrus of Persia, another great monarch. There  were also dangers from within, but courtiers and flatterers kept this  knowledge from him. Priests of rival gods had set themselves up within  the empire; spies from without and conspirators within were secretly  undermining the power of the intrenched despot.    Such was Belshazzar in his pride; such his kingdom and empire. And, so  it was, this was to be an orgy that would set a record for all time to  come.    Artists and artisans of the highest skill had been summoned to the work  of beautifying the enormous palace; its gardens and grounds, innumerable  slaves furnishing the labor. The gold and silver of the nation was  gathered and beaten into ornaments and woven into beautiful designs to  grace the occasion. There was a profusion of the most gorgeous plumage  and richest fabrics, while over all were sprinkled in unheard of  prodigality, the rarest gems and jewels. It was indeed to be a fitting  celebration of the glory of Bel, and the power and magnificence of his  earthly representative; heathen opulence, heathen pride and sensuality  were to outdo themselves.    The revel started at a tremendous pace. No such wines and viands ever  before had been served. No such music ever had been heard and no such  dancers and entertainers ever before had appeared, but, fool that he  was, he had reckoned without his host; had made a covenant with Death  and Hell and had known it not, and the hour of atonement was upon him;  the handwriting on the wall of the true and outraged God, conveyed the  information; short and crisp, that he had been weighed; he and his  kingdom in the balance and found wanting; the hour--his hour, had  struck; the time of restitution and atonement long on the way, had come;  Babylon was to fall--FELL!--and for twenty-five centuries its glory and  its power has been a story that is told; its magnificence but heaps of  sand in the desert where night birds shriek and wild beasts find their  lair.    In the Kaiser's heart was the same barbaric pride, the same ambition,  the same worship of a false god and the same belief that he was the  especial agent of that deity.    His extravagances of vision and ambition were no less demoralizing to  humanity and civilization, than those that brought decay and ruin to the  potentates of old. He graced them with all the luxury and exuberance  that modern civilization, without arousing rebellious complaint among  his subjects, would permit. His gatherings appeared to be arranged for  the bringing together of the bright minds of the empire, that there  might be an exchange of thought and sentiment that would work to the  good of his country and the happiness of the world. Frequently  ministers, princes and statesmen from other countries were present, that  they might become acquainted with the German idea--its kultur--working  for the good of humanity.    Here was The Beast mentioned in Revelations, in a different guise;  wearing the face of benevolence and clothed in the raiment of Heaven.  There were feasts of which the German people knew nothing, and to which  foreign ambassadors were not invited. At these feasts the wines were  furnished by Belial. They were occasions for the glorification of the  German god of war; of greed and conquest; ambition and vanity; without  pity, sympathy or honor.    Ruthless, vain, arrogant minds met the same qualities in their leader.  Some knew and welcomed the fact that the devil was their guest of honor;  perhaps others did not know it. Deluded as they all were and blinded by  pride and self-seeking, the same handwriting that told Belshazzar of  disaster was on the wall, but they could not or would not see it. There  was no Daniel to interpret for them.    German madness for war asserted itself in the ultimatum sent by Austria  to Serbia after the assassination at Sarajevo. Sufficient time had  hardly elapsed for an investigation of the crime and the fixing of the"]]]
