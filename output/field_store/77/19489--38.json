[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#5)"],[1," March. The _sal_, however, is never entirely  leafless; the young foliage appears as the old drops off; while this  change is taking place the minute pale yellow flowers open out.    The familiar yellow wasps, which have been hibernating during the cold  weather, emerge from their hiding-places and begin to construct their  umbrella-shaped nests or combs, which look as if they were made of  rice-paper.    March is a month of great activity for the birds. Those that  constituted the avian chorus of February continue to sing, and to  their voices are now added those of many other minstrels. Chief of  these is the pied singer of Ind--the magpie-robin or _dhayal_--whose  song is as beautiful as that of the English robin at his best. From  the housetops the brown rock-chat begins to pour forth his exceedingly  sweet lay. The Indian robin is in full song. The little golden ioras,  hidden away amid dense foliage, utter their many joyful sounds. The  brain-fever bird grows more vociferous day by day. The crow-pheasants,  which have been comparatively silent during the colder months of the  year, now begin to utter their low sonorous _whoot_, _whoot_, _whoot_,  which is heard chiefly at dawn.    Everywhere the birds are joyful and noisy; nowhere more so than at the  silk-cotton and the coral trees. These, although botanically very  different, display many features in common. They begin to lose their  leaves soon after the monsoon is over, and are leafless by the end of  the winter. In the early spring, while the tree is still devoid of  foliage, huge scarlet, crimson or yellow flowers emerge from every  branch. Each flower is plentifully supplied with honey; it is a  flowing bowl of which all are invited to partake, and hundreds of  thousands of birds accept the invitation with right good-will. The  scene at each of these trees, when in full flower, baffles  description.    Scores of birds forgather there--rosy starlings, mynas, babblers,  bulbuls, king-crows, tree-pies, green parrots, sunbirds and crows.  These all drink riotously and revel so loudly that the sound may be  heard at a distance of half a mile or more. Even before the sun has  risen and begun to dispel the pleasant coolness of the night the  drinking begins. It continues throughout the hours of daylight.  Towards midday, when the west wind blows very hot, it flags somewhat,  but even when the temperature is nearer 100 degrees than 90 degrees  some avian brawlers are present. As soon as the first touch of the  afternoon coolness is felt the clamour acquires fresh vigour and does  not cease until the sun has set in a dusty haze, and the spotted  owlets have emerged and begun to cackle and call as is their wont.    These last are by no means the only birds that hold concert parties  during the hours of darkness. In open country the jungle owlet and the  dusky-horned owl call at intervals, and the Indian nightjar  (_Caprimulgus asiaticus_) imitates the sound of a stone skimming over  ice. In the forest tracts Franklin's and Horsfield's nightjars make  the welkin ring. Scarce has the sun disappeared below the horizon when  the former issues forth and utters its harsh _tweet_. Horsfield's  nightjar emerges a few minutes later, and, for some hours after dusk  and for several before dawn, it utters incessantly its loud monotonous  _chuck_, _chuck_, _chuck_, _chuck_, _chuck_, which has been aptly  compared to the sound made by striking a plank sharply with a hammer.    March is the month in which the majority of the shrikes or  butcher-birds go a-courting. There is no false modesty about  butcher-birds. They are not ashamed to introduce their unmelodious  calls into the avian chorus. But they are mild offenders in comparison  with the king-crows (_Dicrurus ater_) and the rollers (_Coracias  indica_).    The little black king-crows are at all seasons noisy and vivacious:  from the end of February until the rains have set in they are  positively uproarious. Two or three of them love to sit on a telegraph  wire, or a bare branch of a tree, and hold a concert. The first  performer draws itself up to its full height and then gives vent to  harsh cries. Before it has had time to deliver itself of all it has to  sing, an impatient neighbour joins in and tries to shout it down. The  concert may last for half an hour or longer; the scene is shifted from  time to time as the participants become too excited to sit still. The  king-crows so engaged appear to be selecting their mates; nevertheless  nest-construction does not begin before the end of April.    Some human beings may fail to notice the courtship of the king-crow,  but none can be so deaf and blind as to miss the love-making of the  gorgeous roller or blue jay. Has not everyone marvelled at the hoarse  cries and rasping screams which emanate from these birds as they fling  themselves into the air and ascend and descend as though they were  being tossed about by unseen hands?    Their wonderful aerial performances go on continually in the hours of  daylight throughout the months of March and April; at this season the  birds, beautiful although they be, are a veritable nuisance, and most  people gratefully welcome the comparative quiet that supervenes after  the eggs have been laid. The madness of the March hare is mild  compared with that of the March roller. It is difficult to realise  that the harsh and angry-sounding cries of these birds denote, not  rage, but joy.    The great exodus of the winter visitors from the plains of India  begins in March. It continues until mid-May, by which time the last of  the migratory birds will have reached its distant breeding ground.    This exodus is usually preceded by the gathering into flocks of the  rose-coloured starlings and the corn-buntings. Large noisy  congregations of these birds are a striking feature of February in  Bombay, of March in the United Provinces, and of April in the Punjab.    Rose-coloured starlings spend most of their lives in the plains of  India, going to Asia Minor for a few months each summer for nesting  purposes. In the autumn they spread themselves over the greater part  of Hindustan, most abundantly in the Deccan.    In the third or fourth week of February the rosy starlings of Bombay  begin to form flocks. These make merry among the flowers of the coral  tree, which appear first in South India, and last in the Punjab. The  noisy flocks journey northwards in a leisurely manner, timing their  arrival at each place simultaneously with the flowering of the coral  trees. They feed on the nectar provided by these flowers and those of  the silk-cotton tree. They also take toll of the ripening corn and of  the mulberries which are now in season. Thus the rosy starlings reach  Allahabad about the second week in March, and Lahore some fifteen days  later.    The head, neck, breast, wings and tail of the rosy starling are glossy  black, and the remainder of the plumage is pale salmon in the hen and  the young cock, and faint rose-colour in the adult cock.    Rosy starlings feed chiefly in the morning and the late afternoon.  During the hottest part of the day they perch in trees and hold a  concert, if such a term may be applied to a torrent of sibilant  twitter.    Buntings, like rosy starlings, are social birds, and are very  destructive to grain crops.    As these last are harvested the feeding area of the buntings becomes  restricted, so that eventually every patch of standing crop is alive  with buntings. The spring cereals ripen in the south earlier than in  northern India, so that the cheerful buntings are able to perform  their migratory journey by easy stages and find abundant food all  along the route.    There are two species of corn-bunting--the red-headed (_Emberiza  luteola_) and the black-headed (_E. melanocephala_). In both the lower  plumage is bright yellow.    Among the earliest of the birds to forsake the plains of Hindustan are  the grey-lag goose and the pintail duck. These leave Bengal in  February, but tarry longer in the cooler parts of the country. Of the  other migratory species many individuals depart in March, but the  greater number remain on into April, when they are caught up in the  great migratory wave that surges over the country. The destination of  the majority of these migrants is Tibet or Siberia, but a few are  satisfied with the cool slopes of the Himalayas as a summer resort in  which to busy themselves with the sweet cares of nesting. Examples of  these more local migrants are the grey-headed and the verditer  flycatchers, the Indian bush-chat and, to some extent, the paradise  flycatcher and the Indian oriole. The case of the oriole is  interesting. All the Indian orioles (_Oriolus kundoo_) disappear from  the Punjab and the United Provinces in winter. In the former province  no other oriole replaces _O. kundoo_, but in the United Provinces the  black-headed oriole (_O. melanocephalus_) comes to take the place of  the other from October to March. When this last returns to the United  Provinces in March the greater number of _melanocephalus_ individuals  go east, a few only remaining in the sub-Himalayan tracts of the  province.    The Indian oriole is not the only species which finds the climate of  the United Provinces too severe for it in winter; the koel and the  paradise flycatcher likewise desert us in the coldest months. From the  less temperate Punjab several species migrate in October which manage  to maintain themselves in the United Provinces throughout the year:  these are the purple sunbird, the little green and the blue-tailed  bee-eaters, and the yellow-throated sparrow. The return of these and  the other migrant species to the Punjab in March is as marked a  phenomenon as is the arrival of the swallow and the cuckoo in England  in spring.    The behaviour of the king-crows shows the marked effect a  comparatively small difference of temperature may exert on the habits  of some birds.

It was because he had a full  stomach and was feeling too good-natured and lazy to quarrel.    \"Good morning, Granny Fox. I hope you are feeling well this morning,\"  said Bobby Coon, as old Granny Fox came trotting under the tree he was  sitting in. Granny Fox looked up and glared at him with yellow eyes.    \"It isn't a good morning and I'm not feeling fine!\" she snapped.    \"My goodness, how you have torn your skirts!\" exclaimed Bobby Coon.    Old Granny Fox started to say something unpleasant. Then she changed her  mind and instead she sat down and told Bobby Coon all her troubles. As  she talked, Bobby Coon kept ducking his head behind a branch of the tree  to hide a smile. Finally Granny Fox noticed it.    \"What do you keep ducking your head for, Bobby Coon?\" she asked  suspiciously.    \"I'm just looking to see if I can see any feathers from that chicken,\"  replied Bobby Coon gravely, though his eyes were twinkling with  mischief.    \"Well, do you?\" demanded old Granny Fox.    And just then Bobby Coon did. They were not on the ground, however, but  floating in the air. Bobby Coon leaned out to see where they came from,  and Granny Fox turned to look, too. What do you think they saw? Why,  sitting on a tall, dead tree was Mr. Goshawk, just then swallowing the  last of Granny's chicken.    \"Thief! thief! robber! robber!\" shrieked old Granny Fox.    But Mr. Goshawk said nothing, just winked at Bobby Coon, puffed out his  feathers, and settled himself for a comfortable nap.          XV. Reddy Fox Has a Visitor    Hardly was old Granny Fox out of sight on her way to hunt for the  chicken she had left on the hill, when Unc' Billy Possum came strolling  along the Lone Little Path. He was humming to himself, for he had just  had a good breakfast. One of the Merry Little Breezes spied him and  hurried to meet him and tell him about how Reddy Fox had been shot.    Unc' Billy listened, and the grin with which he had greeted the Merry  Little Breeze grew into a broad smile.    \"Are yo' all sure about that?\" he asked.    The Merry Little Breeze was sure.    Unc' Billy Possum stopped for a few minutes and considered.    \"Serves that no 'count Reddy Fox right,\" chuckled Unc' Billy. \"He done  spoil mah hunting at Farmer Brown's, he raised such a fuss among the  hens up there. 'Tisn't safe to go there any mo'! No, Suh, 'tisn't safe,  and it won't be safe for a right smart while. Did yo' say that Granny  Fox is home?\"    The Merry Little Breeze hadn't said anything about Granny Fox, but now  remembered that she had gone up the hill.    \"Ah believe Ah will just tote my sympathy over to Reddy Fox,\" said Unc'  Billy Possum, as he started in the direction of Reddy Fox's house.  But he made sure that old Granny Fox was not at home before he showed  himself. Reddy Fox lay on his doorstep. He was sick and sore and stiff.  Indeed, he was so stiff he couldn't walk at all. And he was weak--weak  and hungry, dreadfully hungry. When he heard footsteps, he thought old  Granny Fox was bringing him the chicken after which she had gone. He  felt too ill even to turn his head.    \"Did you get the chicken, Granny?\" he asked weakly. No one answered. \"I  say, did you get the chicken, Granny?\" Reddy's voice sounded a little  sharp and cross as he asked this time.    Still there was no reply, and Reddy began to be a little bit suspicious.  He turned over and raised his head to look. Instead of old Granny Fox,  there was Unc' Billy Possum grinning at him.         \"Smarty, Smarty is a thief!        Smarty, Smarty came to grief!        Tried to show off just for fun        And ran too near a loaded gun.    \"Yo' all certainly has got just what yo' deserve, and Ah'm glad of it!  Ah'm glad of it, Suh!\" said Unc' Billy Possum severely.    An angry light came into the eyes of Reddy Fox and made them an ugly  yellow for just a minute. But he felt too sick to quarrel. Unc' Billy  Possum saw this. He saw how Reddy was really suffering, and down deep  in his heart Unc' Billy was truly sorry for him. But he didn't let Reddy  know it. No, indeed! He just pretended to be tickled to death to see  Reddy Fox so helpless. He didn't dare stay long, for fear Granny Fox  would return. So, after saying a few more things to make Reddy feel  uncomfortable, Unc' Billy started off up the Lone Little Path toward the  Green Forest.    \"Too bad! Too bad!\" he muttered to himself. \"If ol' Granny Fox isn't  smart enough to get Reddy enough to eat, Ah'll have to see what we-alls  can do. Ah cert'nly will.\"          XVI. Unc' Billy Possum Visits the Smiling Pool    Joe Otter and Billy Mink were sitting on the Big Rock in the Smiling  Pool. Because they had nothing else to do, they were planning mischief.  Jerry Muskrat was busy filling his new house with food for the winter.  He was too busy to get into mischief.    Suddenly Billy Mink put a finger on his lips as a warning to Little Joe  Otter to keep perfectly still. Billy's sharp eyes had seen something  moving over in the bulrushes. Together he and Little Joe Otter watched,  ready to dive into the Smiling Pool at the first sign of danger. In a  few minutes the rushes parted and a sharp little old face peered out.  Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink each sighed with relief, and their eyes  began to dance. \"Hi, Unc' Billy Possum!\" shouted Billy Mink.    A grin crept over the sharp little old face peering out from the  bulrushes.    \"Hi, yo'self!\" he shouted, for it really was Unc' Billy Possum.    \"What are you doing over here?\" called Little Joe Otter.    \"Just a-looking round,\" replied Unc' Billy Possum, his eyes twinkling.    \"Have you heard about Reddy Fox?\" shouted Billy Mink.    \"Ah done jes' come from his home,\" replied Unc' Billy Possum.    \"How is he?\" asked Little Joe Otter.    \"Po'ly, he sho'ly is po'ly,\" replied Unc' Billy Possum, shaking his head  soberly. Then Unc' Billy told Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter how Reddy  Fox was so stiff and sore and sick that he couldn't get anything to eat  for himself, and how old Granny Fox had lost a chicken which she had  caught for him.    \"Serves him right!\" exclaimed Billy Mink, who has never forgotten how  Reddy Fox fooled him and caught the most fish once upon a time.    Unc' Billy nodded his head. \"Yo' are right. Yo' cert'nly are right. Yes,  Suh, Ah reckons yo' are right. Was yo' ever hungry, Billy Mink--real  hungry?\" asked Unc' Billy Possum.    Billy Mink thought of the time when he went without his dinner because  Mr. Night Heron had gobbled it up, when Billy had left it in a temper.  He nodded his head.    \"Ah was just a-wondering,\" continued Une' Billy Possum, \"how it would  seem to be right smart powerful hungry and not be able to hunt fo'  anything to eat.\"    For a few minutes no one said a word. Then Billy Mink stood up and  stretched. \"Good-by,\" said Billy Mink.    \"Where are you going so suddenly?\" demanded Little Joe Otter.    \"I'm going to catch a fish and take it up to Reddy Fox, if you must  know!\" snapped Billy Mink.    \"Good!\" cried Little Joe Otter. \"You needn't think that you can have all  the fun to yourself either, Billy Mink. I'm going with you.\"    There was a splash in the Smiling Pool, and Unc' Billy Possum was left  looking out on nothing but the Smiling Pool and the Big Rock. He smiled  to himself as he turned away. \"Ah reckon Ah'll sho' have to do my share,  too,\" said he.    And so it happened that when old Granny Fox finally reached home with  nothing but a little wood mouse for Reddy, she found him taking a nap,  his stomach as full as it could be. And just a little way off were two  fish tails and the feathers of a little duck.          XVII. Farmer Brown's Boy Is Determined    Farmer Brown's boy had made up his mind. When he shut his teeth with a  click and drew his lips together into a thin, straight line, those who  knew him were sure that Farmer Brown's boy had made up his mind. That is  just what he had done now. He was cleaning his gun, and as he worked he  was thinking of his pet chicken and of all the other chickens that Reddy  Fox had taken.    \"I'm going to get that fox if it takes all summer!\" exclaimed Farmer  Brown's boy. \"I ought to have gotten him the other day when I had a shot  at him. Next time well, we'll see, Mr. Fox, what will happen next time.\"    Now someone heard Farmer Brown's boy, heard everything he said, though  Farmer Brown's boy didn't know it. It was Unc' Billy Possum, who was  hiding in the very pile of wood on which Farmer Brown's boy was sitting.  Unc' Billy pricked up his ears.    He didn't like the tone of voice in which Farmer Brown's boy spoke.  He thought of Reddy Fox still so stiff and sore and lame that he could  hardly walk, all from the shot which Farmer Brown's boy thought had  missed.    \"There isn't gwine to be any next time. No, Suh, there isn't gwine to be  any next time. Ah sho'ly doan love Reddy Fox, but Ah can't nohow let  him be shot again. Ah cert'nly can't!\" muttered Unc' Billy Possum to  himself.    Of course, Farmer Brown's boy didn't hear him. He didn't hear him and he  didn't see him when Unc' Billy Possum crept out of the back side of the  woodpile and scurried under the henhouse. He was too intent on his plan  to catch Reddy Fox.    \"I'm just going to hunt over the Green Meadows and through the Green  Forest until I get that fox!\" said Farmer Brown's boy, and as he said it  he looked very fierce, as if he really meant it. \"I'm not going to  have my chickens stolen any more! No, Sir-e-e! That fox has got a home  somewhere on the Green Meadows or in the Green Forest, and I'm going to  find it. Then watch out, Mr. Fox!\"    Farmer Brown's boy whistled for Bowser the Hound and started for the  Green Forest.    Unc' Billy Possum poked his sharp little old face out from under the  henhouse and watched them go. Usually Unc' Billy is grinning, but now  there wasn't any grin, not the least sign of one. Instead Unc' Billy  Possum looked worried.  "]]]
