People smile incredulously at the mention of an artificial language,  implying that no easy royal road can be found to language-learning of  any kind. But the odds are all the other way, and they are heavy odds.    The reason for this is quite simple, and may be briefly put as follows:    The object of language is to express thought and feeling. Every natural  language contains all kinds of complications and irregularities,  which are of no use whatever in attaining this object, but merely  exist because they happen to have grown. Their sole _raison d'être_  is historical. In fact, for a language without a history they are  _unnecessary_[1]. Therefore a universal language, whose only object is  to supply to every one the simplest possible means of expressing his  thoughts and feelings in a medium intelligible to every one else,  simply leaves them out. Now, it is precisely in these \"unnecessary\"  complications that a large proportion--certainly more than half--of  the difficulty of learning a foreign language consists. Therefore an  artificial language, by merely leaving them out, becomes certainly more  than twice as easy to learn as any natural language.       [1]i.e. they do not assist in attaining its object as a language. One     universal way of forming the plural, past tense, or comparative     expresses plurality, past time, or comparison just as well as fifteen     ways, and with a deal less trouble.    A little reflection will make this truth so absurdly obvious, that the  only wonder is, not that it is now beginning to be recognized, but that  any one could have ever derided it.    That the \"unnecessary\" difficulties of a natural language are more than  one-half of the whole is certainly an under-estimate; for some languages  the proportion would be more like 3:4 or 5:6. Compared with these, the  artificial language would be three times to five times as easy.    Take an illustration. Compare the work to be done by the learner of  (_a_) Latin, (_b_) Esperanto, in expressing past, present, and future  action.    (_a_) Latin:    Present tense active is expressed by--                   6 endings in the 1st regular conjugation.                 6        \"       2nd         \"                 6        \"       3rd         \"                 6        \"       4th         \"    Total regular endings: 24.    To these must be added a vast number of quite different and varying  forms for irregular verbs.    (_b_) Esperanto:    Present tense active is expressed by--                    1 ending for every verb in the language.    Total regular and irregular endings: 1.    It is exactly the same for the past and future.    Total endings for the 3 tenses active:    (_a_) Latin: 72 regular forms, plus a very large number of irregular and  defective verbs.    (_b_) Esperanto: 3 forms.    Turning to the passive voice, we get--    (_a_) Latin: A complete set of different endings, some of them puzzling  in form and liable to confusion with other parts of the verb.    (_b_) Esperanto: No new endings at all. Merely the three-form regular  active conjugation of the verb _esti_ = to be, with a passive participle.  No confusion possible.    It is just the same with compound tenses, subjunctives, participles,  etc. Making all due allowances, it is quite safe to say that the Latin  verb is fifty times as hard as the Esperanto verb.    The proportion would be about the same in the case of substantives,  Latin having innumerable types.    Comparing modern languages with Esperanto, the proportion in favour of  the latter would not be so high as fifty to one in the inflection of  verbs and nouns, though even here it would be very great, allowing for  subjunctives, auxiliaries, irregularities, etc. But taking the whole  languages, it might well rise to ten to one.    For what are the chief difficulties in language-learning?    They are mainly either difficulties of phonetics, or of structure and  vocabulary.    Difficulties of phonetics are:    (1) Multiplicity of sounds to be produced, including many sounds and  combinations that do not occur in the language of the learner.    (2) Variation of accent, and of sounds expressed by the same letter.    These difficulties are both eliminated in Esperanto.    (1) Relatively few sounds are adopted into the language, and only such  as are common to nearly all languages. For instance, there are only five  full vowels and three[1] diphthongs, which can be explained to every  speaker in terms of his own language. All the modified vowels, closed  \"u's\" and \"e's,\" half tones, longs and shorts, open and closed vowels,  etc., which form the chief bugbear in correct pronunciation, and often  render the foreigner unintelligible--all these disappear.       [1]Omitting the rare _eux_. _ej_ and _uj_ are merely simple vowels     plus consonantal _j_ (= English _y_).    (2) There is no variation of accent or of sound expressed by the  same letter. The principle \"one letter, one sound\"[1] is adhered to  absolutely. Thus, having learned one simple rule for accent (always on  the last syllable but one), and the uniform sound corresponding to each  letter, no mistake is possible.       [1]The converse--\"one sound, one letter\"--is also true, except that     the same sound is expressed by _c_ and _ts_. (See Appendix C.)    Contrast this with English. Miss Soames gives twenty-one ways of writing  the same sound. Here they are:    [Transcriber's Note:  Letters originally printed in _italics_ are here CAPITALIZED for  clarity.]                AtE           grEAt            fEIGn              bAss          EH!              wEIGH              pAIn          gAOl             AYE              pAY           gAUgE            obEYEd              dAHlia        champAGnE        wEIGHEd              vEIn          campAIGn         trAIT              thEY          strAIGHt         hALFpenny[1]       [1]Prof. Skeat adds a twenty-second: Lord Reay!    (Compare eye, lie, high, etc.)    In Esperanto this sound is expressed only and always by \"e.\" In fact,  the language is absolutely and entirely phonetic, as all real language  was once.    As regards difficulties of vocabulary, the same may be said as in  the case of the sounds. Esperanto only adopts the minimum of roots  essential, and these are simple, non-ambiguous, and as international  as possible. Owing to the device of word-building by means of a few  suffixes and prefixes with fixed meaning, the number of roots necessary  is very greatly less than in any natural language.[1]       [1]Most of these roots are already known to educated people. For the     young the learning of a certain number of words presents practically     no difficulty; it is in the practical application of words learnt     that they break down, and this failure is almost entirely due to     \"unnecessary\" difficulties.    As for difficulties of structure, some of the chief ones are as follows:    _Multiplicity and complexity of inflections._ This does not exist in  Esperanto.    _Irregularities and exceptions of all kinds._ None in Esperanto.    _Complications of orthography._ None in Esperanto.    _Different senses of same word, and different words used in same sense._  Esperanto--\"one word, one meaning.\"    _Arbitrary and fluctuating idioms._ Esperanto--none. Common sense and  common grammar the only limitation to combination of words.    _Complexities of syntax._ (Think of the use of the subjunctive and  infinitive in all languages: _on_ and _me_ in Greek; indirect speech  in Latin; negatives, comparisons, etc., etc., in all languages.)  Esperanto--none. Common sense the only guide, and no ambiguity in  practice. The perfect limpidity of Esperanto, with no syntactical rules,  is a most instructive proof of the conventionality and arbitrariness of  the niceties of syntax in national languages. After all, the subjunctive  was made for man and not man for the subjunctive.    But readers will say: \"It is all very well to show by a comparison of  forms that Esperanto _ought_ to be much easier than a natural language.  But we want facts.\"    Here are some.    In the last chapter it was mentioned that the present writer first took  up Esperanto in October 1905, worked at it at odd times, never spoke it  or heard it spoken save once, and was able to follow the proceedings  of the Congress of Geneva in August 1906, and talk to all foreigners.  From a long experience of smattering in many languages and learning a  few thoroughly, he is absolutely convinced that this would have been  impossible to him in any national language.    A lady who began Esperanto three weeks before the congress, and studied  it in a grammar by herself one hour each day, was able to talk in it  with all peoples on very simple subjects, and to follow a considerable  amount of the lectures, etc.    Amongst the British folk who attended the congress were many clerks  and commercial people, who had merely learnt Esperanto by attending a  class or a local group meeting once a week, often for not many months.  They had never been out of England before, nor learnt any other foreign  language. They would have been utterly at sea if they had attempted to  do what they did on a similar acquaintance with any foreign tongue.  But during the two days spent _en route_ in Paris, where the British  party was fêted and shown round by the French Esperantists, on the  journey to Geneva, which English and French made together, on lake  steamboats, at picnics and dinners, etc., etc., here they were, rattling  away with great ease and mutual entertainment. Many of these came  from the North of England, and it was a real eye-opener, over which  easy-going South-Englanders would do well to ponder, to see what results  could be produced by a little energy and application, building on no  previous linguistic training. The Northern accent was evidently a help  in pronouncing the full-sounding vowels of Esperanto.    One Englishman, who was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16751"],[0,"McGuffey's Sixth Eclectic Reader (#5)"],[1,"  EXAMPLES. (24)    1. It is not by starts of application that eminence can be attained'.    2. It was not an eclipse that caused the darkness at the crucifixion of  our Lord'; for the sun and moon were not relatively in a position' to  produce an eclipse'.    3. They are not fighting': do not disturb' them: this man is not expiring  with agony': that man is not dead': they are only pausing'.    4. My Lord, we could not have had such designs'.    5. You are not left alone to climb the steep ascent': God is with you, who  never suffers the spirit that rests on him to fail.      Exception 1.--Emphasis may reverse this rule.      EXAMPLE. (24)    We repeat it, we do not' desire to produce discord; we do not' wish to  kindle the flames of a civil war.      Exception 2.--General propositions and commands usually have the  falling inflection.      EXAMPLES. (25)    God is not the author of sin'. Thou shalt not kill.    RULE VI.--Interrogative sentences, and members of sentences which  can be answered by yes or no generally require the rising inflection.      EXAMPLES. (25)    1. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation'?    2. Does the gentleman suppose it is in his power', to exhibit in Carolina  a name so bright' as to produce envy' in my bosom?    3. If it be admitted, that strict integrity is not the shortest way to  success, is it not the surest', the happiest', the best'?    4.  Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens, To wash this crimson  hand as white as snow'?    Exception.--Emphasis may reverse this rule.      EXAMPLES. (25)    1, Can' you be so blind to your interest? Will' you rush headlong to  destruction?    2. I ask again, is' there no hope of reconciliation? Must' we abandon all  our fond anticipations?    3.  Will you deny' it? Will you deny' it?    4. Am I Dromio'? Am I your man'? Am I myself'?      RULE VII.--Interrogative exclamations, and words repeated as a kind  of echo to the thought, require the rising inflection.    EXAMPLES. (25)    1. Where grows', where grows it not'?    2. What'! Might Rome have been taken'? Rome taken when I was consul'?    3. Banished from Rome'! Tried and convicted traitor'!    4. Prince Henry. What's the matter'?       Falstaff. What's the matter'? Here be four of us     have taken a thousand pounds this morning.       Prince H. Where is' it, Jack, where is' it?       Fal. Where is' it? Taken from us, it is.    5. Ha'! laughest thou, Lochiel, my vision to scorn?    6. And this man is called a statesman. A statesman'? Why, he never  invented a decent humbug.    7. I can not say, sir, which of these motives influence the advocates of  the bill before us; a bill', in which such cruelties are proposed as are  yet unknown among the most savage nations.      RISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS. (26)    RULE VIII.--Words and members of a sentence expressing antithesis  or contrast, require opposite inflections.    EXAMPLES. (26)    1. By honor' and dishonor'; by evil' report and good' report; as  deceivers' and yet true'.    2. What they know by reading', I know by experience'.    3. I could honor thy courage', but I detest thy crimes'.    4. It is easier to forgive the weak', who have injured us', than the  powerful' whom we' have injured.    5. Homer was the greater genius', Virgil the better artist'.    6. The style of Dryden is capricious and varied'; that of Pope is cautious  and uniform'. Dryden obeys the emotions of his own mind'; Pope constrains  his mind to his own rules of composition.' Dryden is sometimes vehement  and rapid'; Pope is always smooth, uniform, and gentle'. Dryden's page is  a natural field, rising into inequalities, varied by exuberant  vegetation'; Pope's is a velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe and leveled by  the roller'.    7. If the flights of Dryden are higher', Pope continues longer on the  wing'. If the blaze of Dryden's fire is brighter', the heat of Pope's is  more regular and constant'. Dryden often surpasses' expectation, and Pope  never falls below' it.    REMARK l.--Words and members connected by or used disjunctively, generally  express contrast or antithesis, and always receive opposite inflection.      EXAMPLES. (27)    1. Shall we advance', or retreat'?    2. Do you seek wealth', or power'?    3. Is the great chain upheld by God', or thee'?    4. Shall we return to our allegiance while we may do so with safety and  honor', or shall we wait until the ax of the executioner is at our  throats'?    5. Shall we crown' the author of these public calamities with garlands',  or shall we wrest' from him his ill-deserved authority' ?    REMARK 2.--When the antithesis is between affirmation and negation, the  latter usually has the rising inflection, according to Rule V.      EXAMPLES. (27)    1. You were paid to fight' against Philip, not to rail' at him.    2. I said rationally', not irrationally'.    3. I did not say rationally', but irrationally'.    4. I said an elder' soldier, not a better'.    5. Let us retract while we can', not when we must'.    REMARK 3.--The more emphatic member generally receives the  falling inflection.      EXAMPLES. (27)    1. A countenance more in sorrow', than anger'.    2. A countenance less in anger', than sorrow'.    3. You should show your courage by deeds', rather than by words.    4. If we can not remove' pain, we may alleviate' it.        OF SERIES. (28)    A series is a number of particulars immediately following one another  in the same grammatical construction.    A commencing series is one which commences a sentence or clause.      EXAMPLE. (28)    Faith, hope, love, joy, are the fruits of the spirit.    A concluding series is one which concludes a sentence or a clause.      EXAMPLE. (28)    The fruits of the spirit are faith, hope, love, and joy.    RULE IX.--All the members of a commencing series, when not emphatic,  usually require the rising inflection.      EXAMPLES. (28)    1. War', famine', pestilence', storm', and fire' besiege mankind.    2. The knowledge', the power', the wisdom', the goodness' of God, must all  be unbounded.    3. To advise the ignorant', to relieve the needy', and to comfort the  afflicted' are the duties that fall in our way almost every day of our  lives.    4. No state chicanery', no narrow system of vicious politics', no idle  contest for ministerial victories', sank him to the vulgar level of the  great.    5. For solidity of reasoning', force of sagacity', and wisdom of  conclusion', no nation or body of men can compare with the Congress at  Philadelphia.    6. The wise and the foolish', the virtuous and the evil', the learned and  the ignorant', the temperate and the profligate', must often be blended  together.    7. Absalom's beauty', Jonathan's love', David's valor', Solomon's wisdom',  the patience of Job, the prudence of Augustus', and the eloquence of  Cicero' are found in perfection in the Creator.      REMARK.--Some elocutionists prefer to give the falling inflection to the  last member of a commencing series.    Exception.--In a commencing series, forming a climax, the last term  usually requires the falling inflection.      EXAMPLES. (29)    1. Days', months', years', and ages', shall circle away,     And still the vast waters above thee shall roll.    2. Property', character', reputation', everything', was sacrificed.    3. Toils', sufferings', wounds', and death' was the price of our liberty.      RULE X.--All the members of a concluding series, when not at all emphatic,  usually require the falling inflection.      EXAMPLES. (29)    1. It is our duty to pity', to support', to defend', and to relieve' the  oppressed.    2. At the sacred call of country, they sacrifice property', ease',  health', applause' and even life'.    3. I protest against this measure as cruel', oppressive', tyrannous', and  vindictive'.    4. God was manifest in the flesh', justified in the Spirit', seen of  angels', preached unto the Gentiles', believed on in the world', received  up into glory'.    5. Charity vaunteth not itself', is not puffed up', doth not behave itself  unseemly', seeketh not her own', is not easily provoked', thinketh no  evil'; beareth' all things, believeth' all things, hopeth' all things,  endureth' all things.    REMARK.--Some authors give the following rule for the reading of a  concluding series: \"All the particulars of a concluding series, except the  last but one, require the falling inflection.\" Exception l.--When the  particulars enumerated in a concluding series are not at all emphatic, all  except the last require the rising inflection.      EXAMPLES (30)    He was esteemed for his kindness', his intelligence', his self-denial',  and his active benevolence'.    Exception 2.--When all the terms of a concluding series are strongly  emphatic, they all receive the falling inflection.    EXAMPLES. (30)    1. They saw not one man', not one woman', not one child', not one  four-footed beast'.    2. His hopes', his happiness', his life', hung upon the words that fell  from those lips,    3. They fought', they bled', they died', for freedom.        PARENTHESIS. (30)    RULE XI.--A parenthesis should be read more rapidly and in a lower key  than the rest of the sentence, and should terminate with the same  inflection that next precedes it. If, however, it is complicated, or  emphatic, or disconnected from the main subject, the inflections must be  governed by the same rules as in the other cases.    REMARK.--A smooth and expressive reading of a parenthesis is difficult of  acquisition, and can be secured only by careful and persistent training.      EXAMPLES. (30)    1. God is my witness' (whom I serve with my spirit, in the gospel of his  Son'), that, without ceasing, I make mention of you always in my prayers;  making request' (if, by any means, now at length, I might have a  prosperous journey by the will of God'), to come unto you.    2.
