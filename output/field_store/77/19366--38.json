David introduced the \"Judgment of  the Country\" or _Visnet del Pais_ for the settlement of pleas.  Every  free man, in his degree, was \"tried by his peers,\" but the old ordeal by  fire and Trial by Combat or duel were not abolished.  Nor did  \"compurgation\" cease wholly till Queen Mary's reign.  A powerful man,  when accused, was then attended at his trial by hosts of armed backers.  Men so unlike each other as Knox, Bothwell, and Lethington took advantage  of this usage.  All lords had their own Courts, but murder, rape, arson,  and robbery could now only be tried in the royal Courts; these were \"The  Four Pleas of the Crown.\"        THE COURTS.      As there was no fixed capital, the King's Court, in David's time,  followed the King in his annual circuits through his realm, between  Dumfries and Inverness.  Later, the regions of Scotia (north of Forth),  Lothian, and the lawless realm of Galloway, had their Grand Justiciaries,  who held the Four Pleas.  The other pleas were heard in \"Courts of  Royalty\" and by earls, bishops, abbots, down to the baron, with his  \"right of pit and gallows.\"  At such courts, by a law of 1180, the  Sheriff of the shire, or an agent of his, ought to be present; so that  royal and central justice was extending itself over the minor local  courts.  But if the sheriff or his sergeant did not attend when summoned,  local justice took its course.    The process initiated by David's son, William the Lion, was very slowly  substituting the royal authority, the royal sheriffs of shires, juries,  and witnesses, for the wild justice of revenge; and trial by ordeal, and  trial by combat.  But hereditary jurisdictions of nobles and gentry were  not wholly abolished till after the battle of Culloden!  Where Abbots  held courts, their procedure, in civil cases, was based on laws  sanctioned by popes and general councils.  But, alas! the Abbot might  give just judgment; to execute it, we know from a curious instance, was  not within his power, if the offender laughed at a sentence of  excommunication.    David and his successors, till the end of the thirteenth century, made  Scotland a more civilised and kept it a much less disturbed country than  it was to remain during the long war of Independence, while the beautiful  abbeys with their churches and schools attested a high stage of art and  education.          CHAPTER VI.  MALCOLM THE MAIDEN.      The prominent facts in the brief reign of David's son Malcolm the Maiden,  crowned (1153) at the age of eleven, were, first, a Celtic rising by  Donald, a son of Malcolm MacHeth (now a prisoner in Roxburgh Castle), and  a nephew of the famous Somerled Macgillebride of Argyll.  Somerled won  from the Norse the Isle of Man and the Southern Hebrides; from his sons  descend the great Macdonald Lords of the Isles, always the leaders of the  long Celtic resistance to the central authority in Scotland.  Again,  Malcolm resigned to Henry II. of England the northern counties held by  David I.; and died after subduing Galloway, and (on the death of  Somerled, said to have been assassinated) the tribes of the isles in  1165.        WILLIAM THE LION.      Ambition to recover the northern English counties revealed itself in the  overtures of William the Lion,--Malcolm's brother and successor,--for an  alliance between Scotland and France.  \"The auld Alliance\" now dawned,  with rich promise of good and evil.  In hopes of French aid, William  invaded Northumberland, later laid siege to Carlisle, and on July 13,  1174, was surprised in a morning mist and captured at Alnwick.  Scotland  was now kingless; Galloway rebelled, and William, taken a captive to  Falaise in Normandy, surrendered absolutely the independence of his  country, which, for fifteen years, really was a fief of England.  When  William was allowed to go home, it was to fight the Celts of Galloway,  and subdue the pretensions, in Moray, of the MacWilliams, descendants of  William, son of Duncan, son of Malcolm Canmore.    During William's reign (1188) Pope Clement III. decided that the Scottish  Church was subject, not to York or Canterbury, but to Rome.  Seven years  earlier, defending his own candidate for the see of St Andrews against  the chosen of the Pope, William had been excommunicated, and his country  and he had unconcernedly taken the issue of an Interdict.  The Pope was  too far away, and William feared him no more than Robert Bruce was to do.    By 1188, William refused to pay to Henry II. a \"Saladin Tithe\" for a  crusade, and in 1189 he bought from Richard I., who needed money for a  crusade, the abrogation of the Treaty of Falaise.  He was still disturbed  by Celts in Galloway and the north, he still hankered after  Northumberland, but, after preparations for war, he paid a fine and  drifted into friendship with King John, who entertained his little  daughters royally, and knighted his son Alexander.  William died on  December 4, 1214.  He was buried at the Abbey of Arbroath, founded by him  in honour of St Thomas of Canterbury, who had worked a strange posthumous  miracle in Scotland.  William was succeeded by his son, Alexander II.  (1214-1249).        ALEXANDER II.      Under this Prince, who successfully put down the usual northern risings,  the old suit about the claims to Northumberland was finally abandoned for  a trifling compensation (1237).  Alexander had married Joanna, daughter  of King John, and his brother-in-law, Henry III., did not press his  demand for homage for Scotland.  The usual Celtic pretenders to the  throne were for ever crushed.  Argyll became a sheriffdom, Galloway was  brought into order, and Alexander, who died in the Isle of Kerrera in the  bay of Oban (1249), well deserved his title of \"a King of Peace.\"  He was  buried in Melrose Abbey.  In his reign the clergy were allowed to hold  Provincial or Synodal Councils without the presence of a papal Legate  (1225), and the Dominicans and Franciscans appeared in Scotland.        ALEXANDER III.      The term King of Peace was also applied to Alexander III., son of the  second wife of Alexander II., Marie de Coucy.  Alexander came to the  throne (1249) at the age of eight.  As a child he was taken and held  (like James II., James III., James V., and James VI.) by contending  factions of the nobles, Henry of England intervening.  In 1251 he wedded  another child, Margaret, daughter of Henry III. of England, but Henry  neither forced a claim to hold Scotland during the boy's minority (his  right if Scotland were his fief), nor in other respects pressed his  advantage.  In February 1261-1262 a girl was born to Alexander at  Windsor; she was Margaret, later wife of Eric of Norway.  Her daughter,  on the death of Alexander III. (March 19, 1286), was the sole direct  descendant in the male line.    After the birth of this heiress, Alexander won from Norway the isles of  the western coast of Scotland in which Norse chieftains had long held  sway.  They complained to Hakon of Norway concerning raids made on them  by the Earl of Ross, a Celtic potentate.  Alexander's envoys to Hakon  were detained, and in 1263, Hakon, with a great fleet, sailed through the  islands.  A storm blew most of his Armada to shore near Largs, where his  men were defeated by the Scots.  Hakon collected his ships, sailed north,  and (December 15) died at Kirkwall.  Alexander now brought the island  princes, including the Lord of Man, into subjection; and by Treaty, in  1266, placed them under the Crown.  In 1275 Benemund de Vicci (called  Bagimont), at a council in Perth, compelled the clergy to pay a tithe for  a crusade, the Pope insisting that the money should be assessed on the  true value of benefices--that is, on \"Bagimont's Roll,\"--thenceforth  recognised as the basis of clerical taxation.  In 1278 Edward I. laboured  to extract from Alexander an acknowledgment that he was England's vassal.  Edward signally failed; but a palpably false account of Alexander's  homage was fabricated, and dated September 29, 1278.  This was not the  only forgery by which England was wont to back her claims.    A series of bereavements (1281-1283) deprived Alexander of all his  children save his little grandchild, \"the Maid of Norway.\"  She was  recognised by a great national assembly at Scone as heiress of the  throne; and Alexander had no issue by his second wife, a daughter of the  Comte de Dreux.  On the night of March 19, 1285, while Alexander was  riding from Edinburgh to visit his bride at Kinghorn, his horse slipped  over a cliff and the rider was slain.          CHAPTER VII.  ENCROACHMENTS OF EDWARD I.--WALLACE.      The Estates of Scotland met at Scone (April 11, 1286) and swore loyalty  to their child queen, \"the Maid of Norway,\" granddaughter of Alexander  III.  Six guardians of the kingdom were appointed on April 11, 1286.  They  were the Bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, two Comyns (Buchan and  Badenoch), the Earl of Fife, and Lord James, the Steward of Scotland.  No  Bruce or Baliol was among the Custodians.  Instantly a \"band,\" or  covenant, was made by the Bruces, Earls of Annandale and Carrick, to  support their claims (failing the Maid) to the throne; and there were  acts of war on their part against another probable candidate, John  Balliol.  Edward (like Henry VIII. in the case of Mary Stuart) moved for  the marriage of the infant queen to his son.  A Treaty safeguarding all  Scottish liberties as against England was made by clerical influences at  Birgham (July 18, 1290), but by October 7 news of the death of the young  queen reached Scotland: she had perished during her voyage from Norway.  Private war now broke out between the Bruces and Balliols; and the party  of Balliol appealed to Edward, through Fraser, Bishop of St Andrews,  asking the English king to prevent civil war, and recommending Balliol as  a person to be carefully treated.

III. The Watchman's Adventure    \"Why, there is a pair of galoshes, as sure as I'm alive!\" said the  watchman, awaking from a gentle slumber. \"They belong no doubt to the  lieutenant who lives over the way. They lie close to the door.\"    The worthy man was inclined to ring and deliver them at the house, for  there was still a light in the window; but he did not like disturbing  the other people in their beds, and so very considerately he left the  matter alone.    \"Such a pair of shoes must be very warm and comfortable,\" said he; \"the  leather is so soft and supple.\" They fitted his feet as though they  had been made for him. \"'Tis a curious world we live in,\" continued he,  soliloquizing. \"There is the lieutenant, now, who might go quietly to  bed if he chose, where no doubt he could stretch himself at his ease;  but does he do it? No; he saunters up and down his room, because,  probably, he has enjoyed too many of the good things of this world at  his dinner. That's a happy fellow! He has neither an infirm mother, nor  a whole troop of everlastingly hungry children to torment him. Every  evening he goes to a party, where his nice supper costs him nothing:  would to Heaven I could but change with him! How happy should I be!\"    While expressing his wish, the charm of the shoes, which he had put on,  began to work; the watchman entered into the being and nature of the  lieutenant. He stood in the handsomely furnished apartment, and held  between his fingers a small sheet of rose-colored paper, on which some  verses were written--written indeed by the officer himself; for who has  not, at least once in his life, had a lyrical moment? And if one then  marks down one's thoughts, poetry is produced. But here was written:                      OH, WERE I RICH!         \"Oh, were I rich! Such was my wish, yea such        When hardly three feet high, I longed for much.         Oh, were I rich! an officer were I,         With sword, and uniform, and plume so high.         And the time came, and officer was I!       But yet I grew not rich. Alas, poor me!       Have pity, Thou, who all man's wants dost see.            \"I sat one evening sunk in dreams of bliss,        A maid of seven years old gave me a kiss,         I at that time was rich in poesy         And tales of old, though poor as poor could be;         But all she asked for was this poesy.       Then was I rich, but not in gold, poor me!       As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.            \"Oh, were I rich! Oft asked I for this boon.        The child grew up to womanhood full soon.         She is so pretty, clever, and so kind       Oh, did she know what's hidden in my mind--         A tale of old. Would she to me were kind!       But I'm condemned to silence! oh, poor me!       As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.            \"Oh, were I rich in calm and peace of mind,        My grief you then would not here written find!         O thou, to whom I do my heart devote,         Oh read this page of glad days now remote,         A dark, dark tale, which I tonight devote!       Dark is the future now. Alas, poor me!       Have pity Thou, who all men's pains dost see.\"    Such verses as these people write when they are in love! But no man  in his senses ever thinks of printing them. Here one of the sorrows of  life, in which there is real poetry, gave itself vent; not that  barren grief which the poet may only hint at, but never depict in its  detail--misery and want: that animal necessity, in short, to snatch  at least at a fallen leaf of the bread-fruit tree, if not at the fruit  itself. The higher the position in which one finds oneself transplanted,  the greater is the suffering. Everyday necessity is the stagnant pool of  life--no lovely picture reflects itself therein. Lieutenant, love, and  lack of money--that is a symbolic triangle, or much the same as the  half of the shattered die of Fortune. This the lieutenant felt most  poignantly, and this was the reason he leant his head against the  window, and sighed so deeply.    \"The poor watchman out there in the street is far happier than I. He  knows not what I term privation. He has a home, a wife, and children,  who weep with him over his sorrows, who rejoice with him when he is  glad. Oh, far happier were I, could I exchange with him my being--with  his desires and with his hopes perform the weary pilgrimage of life! Oh,  he is a hundred times happier than I!\"    In the same moment the watchman was again watchman. It was the shoes  that caused the metamorphosis by means of which, unknown to himself, he  took upon him the thoughts and feelings of the officer; but, as we have  just seen, he felt himself in his new situation much less contented,  and now preferred the very thing which but some minutes before he had  rejected. So then the watchman was again watchman.    \"That was an unpleasant dream,\" said he; \"but 'twas droll enough  altogether. I fancied that I was the lieutenant over there: and yet  the thing was not very much to my taste after all. I missed my good old  mother and the dear little ones; who almost tear me to pieces for sheer  love.\"    He seated himself once more and nodded: the dream continued to haunt  him, for he still had the shoes on his feet. A falling star shone in the  dark firmament.    \"There falls another star,\" said he: \"but what does it matter; there  are always enough left. I should not much mind examining the little  glimmering things somewhat nearer, especially the moon; for that would  not slip so easily through a man's fingers. When we die--so at least  says the student, for whom my wife does the washing--we shall fly about  as light as a feather from one such a star to the other. That's, of  course, not true: but 'twould be pretty enough if it were so. If I could  but once take a leap up there, my body might stay here on the steps for  what I care.\"    Behold--there are certain things in the world to which one ought never  to give utterance except with the greatest caution; but doubly careful  must one be when we have the Shoes of Fortune on our feet. Now just  listen to what happened to the watchman.    As to ourselves, we all know the speed produced by the employment of  steam; we have experienced it either on railroads, or in boats when  crossing the sea; but such a flight is like the travelling of a sloth in  comparison with the velocity with which light moves. It flies nineteen  million times faster than the best race-horse; and yet electricity is  quicker still. Death is an electric shock which our heart receives; the  freed soul soars upwards on the wings of electricity. The sun's light  wants eight minutes and some seconds to perform a journey of more than  twenty million of our Danish [*] miles; borne by electricity, the soul  wants even some minutes less to accomplish the same flight. To it the  space between the heavenly bodies is not greater than the distance  between the homes of our friends in town is for us, even if they live a  short way from each other; such an electric shock in the heart, however,  costs us the use of the body here below; unless, like the watchman of  East Street, we happen to have on the Shoes of Fortune.         * A Danish mile is nearly 4 3/4 English.      In a few seconds the watchman had done the fifty-two thousand of our  miles up to the moon, which, as everyone knows, was formed out of  matter much lighter than our earth; and is, so we should say, as soft  as newly-fallen snow. He found himself on one of the many circumjacent  mountain-ridges with which we are acquainted by means of Dr. Madler's  \"Map of the Moon.\" Within, down it sunk perpendicularly into a caldron,  about a Danish mile in depth; while below lay a town, whose appearance  we can, in some measure, realize to ourselves by beating the white of  an egg in a glass of water. The matter of which it was built was just as  soft, and formed similar towers, and domes, and pillars, transparent and  rocking in the thin air; while above his head our earth was rolling like  a large fiery ball.    He perceived immediately a quantity of beings who were certainly what  we call \"men\"; yet they looked different to us. A far more correct  imagination than that of the pseudo-Herschel* had created them; and  if they had been placed in rank and file, and copied by some skilful  painter's hand, one would, without doubt, have exclaimed involuntarily,  \"What a beautiful arabesque!\"    *This relates to a book published some years ago in Germany, and said  to be by Herschel, which contained a description of the moon and its  inhabitants, written with such a semblance of truth that many were  deceived by the imposture.    Probably a translation of the celebrated Moon hoax, written by Richard  A. Locke, and originally published in New York.      They had a language too; but surely nobody can expect that the soul of  the watchman should understand it. Be that as it may, it did comprehend  it; for in our souls there germinate far greater powers than we poor  mortals, despite all our cleverness, have any notion of. Does she  not show us--she the queen in the land of enchantment--her astounding  dramatic talent in all our dreams? There every acquaintance appears and  speaks upon the stage, so entirely in character, and with the same tone  of voice, that none of us, when awake, were able to imitate it. How  well can she recall persons to our mind, of whom we have not thought for  years; when suddenly they step forth \"every inch a man,\" resembling the  real personages, even to the finest features, and become the heroes  or heroines of our world of dreams. In reality, such remembrances are  rather unpleasant: every sin, every evil thought, may, like a clock with  alarm or chimes, be repeated at pleasure; then the question is if"]]]
