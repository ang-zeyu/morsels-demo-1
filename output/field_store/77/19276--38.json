But       I'm sure _you_ know what I mean!\" (_November_ 29, 1890).    And farther on in the _Punch_ volumes:--         \"O, Mr. Robinson, does not it ever strike you, in listening to       sweet music, that the Rudiment of Potential Infinite Pain is subtly       woven into the tissue of our keenest joy\" (_December_ 2, 1891).    But perhaps before closing this chapter we should give some examples of  drawing-room conversation pure and simple, without reference to any sort  of craze, as specimens of their author's skill. Familiarity with the  artist's characters will enable the reader to appreciate the note of a  shy man's agony in some, and of feminine spite in others.    Among the \"Speeches to be lived down, if possible,\" there are these:         _She_. \"Let me introduce you to a very charming lady, to take down       to supper.\"         _He_. \"A--thanks--no. I never eat supper.\"         \"By George! I am so hungry I can't talk.\"         _Fair Hostess_ (on hospitable thoughts intent). \"Oh, I'm so glad!\"    \"Things one would rather have left unsaid\":         _Amiable Hostess_. \"What! must you go already? Really, Professor,       it's too bad of this sweet young wife of yours to carry you off so       early! She always does!\"         _Professor_. \"No, no, not _always_, Mrs. Bright. At _most_ houses I       positively have to drag her away!\"    \"Truths that might have been left unspoken\":         _Hostess_. \"What? haven't you brought your sisters, Mr. Jones?\"         _Mr. Jones_. \"No, they couldn't come, Mrs. Smith. The fact is,       they're saving themselves for Mrs. Brown's Dance to-morrow, you       know!\" (_January_ 9, 1886).    Under the heading \"Feline Amenities\":         _Fair Hostess_ (to Mrs. Masham, who is looking her very best).       \"How-dy-do, dear? I hope you're not so tired as you look!\"         _Sympathetic Lady Guest_. \"Don't be unhappy about the rain, dear       Mrs. Bounderson--it will soon be over, and your garden will be       lovelier than ever.\"         _Little Mrs. Goldmore Bounderson_ (who is giving her first Garden       Party). \"Yes; but I'm afraid it will keep my most desirable guests       from coming!\"    This last duologue is pure du Maurier. It is subtle.    \"Feline Amenities\" again:         \"How kind of you to call--I'm sorry to have kept you waiting!\"         \"Oh, don't mention it.--I've not been at all bored! I've been       trying to imagine what I should do to make this room look       comfortable if it were mine!\" (_November_ 22, 1892).    The \"Things one would rather have expressed otherwise\" is a good series  too:         _The Professor_ (to Hostess). \"Thank you so much for a most       delightful evening! I shall indeed go to bed with pleasant       recollections--and _you_ will be the very _last_ person I shall       think of!\"    And again, of the same series:         _Fair Hostess_. \"Good-night, Major Jones. We're supposed to       breakfast at nine, but we're not very punctual people. Indeed the       later you appear to-morrow morning, the better pleased we shall all       be\" (_May_ 13, 1893).    \"Things one would rather have left unsaid\":         _He_. \"Yes, I know Bootle slightly, and confess I don't think much       of him!\"         _She_. \"I know him a little too. He took me in to dinner a little       while ago!\"         _He_. \"Ah, that's just about all he's fit for!\"         _The Hostess_. \"Dear Miss Linnet! would you--would you sing one of       those charming ballads, while I go and see if supper's ready?\"         _The Companion_. \"O, don't ask me--I feel nervous. There are so       many people.\"         _The Hostess_. \"O, they won't listen, bless you! not one of them!       _Now_ DO!!!\"    And here is a conversation that betrays the presence of one of the  currents of public feeling below the smooth surface of well-bred  twaddle:         _In the Metropolitan Railway_. \"I beg your pardon, but I think I       had the pleasure of meeting you in Rome last year?\"         \"No, I've never been nearer to Rome than St. Alban's.\"         \"St. Alban's? Where is that?\"         \"Holborn.\"    Some rather amusing speeches of a different character in which du  Maurier assails the more obvious forms of snobbery of a class below  those with whom his art was generally concerned may be given:         _Among the Philistines_. _Grigsby_. \"Do you _know_ the Joneses,       Mrs. Brown?\"         \"No, we--er--don't care to know _Business_ people as a rule,       although my husband's in business; but then he's in the _Coffee_       Business and they're all _gentlemen_ in the _Coffee_ Business, you       know!\"         _Grigsby_ (who always suits himself to his company). \"_Really_ now!       Why, that's more than can be said of the Army, the Navy, the       Church, the Bar, or even the _House of Lords_! I don't _wonder_ at       your being rather _exclusive_!\" (_Punch's Almanac_, 1882).         \"I see your servants wear cockades now, Miss Shoddson!\"         \"Yes, Pa's just become a member of the Army and Navy Stores.\"      When du Maurier confined himself to observing and to recording he never  failed for subjects. But we suppose as a concession to a section of the  public he felt a leaven of mere jokes was demanded from him every year.  The scene of his struggle to invent those \"jokes\" is one to be veiled.  It is safe to say that it is his distinction to have contributed at once  the best satire and the worst jokes that _Punch_ has ever published. A  black and white artist has told the writer that the _Art_-Editors of  papers look first at the joke. The drawing is accepted or rejected on  the joke. We can only be glad that this was not entirely the editorial  practice on _Punch_ in du Maurier's time. Perhaps the subjoined \"joke\"  of du Maurier's from _Punch_ is the worst in the world:         \"I say, cousin Constance, I've found out why you always call your       Mamma 'Mater.'\"         \"Why, Guy?\"         \"Because she's always trying to find a mate for you girls.\"    [Illustration: Sketch for illustration for \"Wives and Daughters\" 1865.]    And yet if the drawing accompanying this joke be looked at _first_, it  delights with its charm and distinction. Here then is a psychological  fact; the drawing itself seems to the eye a poorer affair once the poor  joke has been read. Having suffered in this way several times in  following with admiration the pencil of du Maurier through the old  volumes of _Punch_, we at last hit upon the plan of always covering the  joke and enjoying first the picture for its own sake, only uncovering  the legend when this has been thoroughly appreciated lest it should turn  out to be merely a feeble joke instead of a happily-invented  conversation. There are some of the drawings for jokes which we should  very much like to have included with our illustrations, but the human  mind being so constituted that it goes direct to the legend of an  illustration, feeling \"sold\" if it isn't there, and the \"jokes\" in some  of these instances being so fatal to the understanding of the atmosphere  and charm of the drawing, we have had to abandon the idea of doing so.  What the reader has to understand is that circumstances harnessed du  Maurier to a certain business; he imported all manner of extraneous  graces into it, and thus gave a determination to the character of the  art of satire which it will never lose. The pages of _Punch_ were  enriched, beautified, and made more delicately human. _Punch_ gained  everything through the connection and du Maurier a stimulus in the  demand for regular work. But it is not impossible to imagine  circumstances which, but for this early connection with _Punch_, would  have awakened and developed a different and perhaps profounder side of  du Maurier, of which we seem to get a glimpse in the illustrations to  Meredith in _The Cornhill Magazine_.      Section 8    The famous reply of an early Editor to the usual complaint that _Punch_  was not as good as it used to be--\"No, sir, it never was\"--cannot be  considered to hold good in any comparison between the present period and  that in which the arts of du Maurier and Keene held sway. There have  been periods, there is such a one now, when the literary side of  _Punch_ has touched a high-water mark. But on the illustrative side  _Punch_ seems to be always hoping that another Keene or du Maurier will  turn up. It does not seem prepared to accept work in quite another  style. But there is no more chance of there ever being another Keene  than of there being another Rembrandt, or of there ever being another du  Maurier than another Watteau. The next genius to whom it is given to  illuminate the pages of the classic journal in a style that will rival  the past is not likely to arise from among those who think that there is  no other view of life than that which was discovered by their immediate  predecessors. By force of his genius--or, if you prefer it, of  sympathy--which means the same thing--for some particular phase of life,  some artist may at any moment uncover in its pages an altogether fresh  kind of humour and of beauty.      Section 9    Du Maurier's art covers the period when England was flushed with  success. Artists in such times grow wealthy, and by their work refine  their time. But in spite of the number of wealthy Academicians living  upon Society in the mid-Victorian time, the influence of Art upon  Society was less than at any time in history in which circumstances have  been favourable to the artist.    The great wave of trade that carried the shop-keeper into the West-end  drawing-room strewed also the curtains and carpets with that outrageous  weed of _trade_ design which gave to the mid-Victorian world its  complexion of singular hideousness.    The aesthetic movement indicated the restlessness of some of the brighter  spirits with this condition, but many of its remedies"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14400"],[0,"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt (#5)"],[1," large space of ground. They  most frequently stood in the midst of a garden, or of an enclosed court  planted with trees; and, like the commoner houses, they turned a blank  front to the street, consisting of bare walls, battlemented like those of a  fortress (fig. 11). Thus, home-life was strictly secluded, and the pleasure  of seeing was sacrificed for the advantages of not being seen. The door was  approached by a flight of two or three steps, or by a porch supported on  columns (fig. 12) and adorned with statues (fig. 13), which gave it a  monumental appearance, and indicated the social importance of the family.    [Illustration: WALL-PAINTINGS, EL AMARNA.  Fig. 12.--Porch of mansion, second Theban period,  Fig. 13.--Porch of mansion, second Theban period.]    Sometimes this was preceded by a pylon-gateway, such as usually heralded  the approach to a temple. Inside the enclosure it was like a small town,  divided into quarters by irregular walls. The dwelling-house stood at the  farther end; the granaries, stabling, and open spaces being distributed in  different parts of the grounds, according to some system to which we as yet  possess no clue. These arrangements, however, were infinitely varied. If I  would convey some idea of the residence of an Egyptian noble,--a residence  half palace, half villa,--I cannot do better than reproduce two out of the  many pictorial plans which have come down to us among the tomb-paintings  of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The first (figs. 14, 15) represent a Theban  house. The enclosure is square, and surrounded by an embattled wall. The  main gate opens upon a road bordered with trees, which runs beside a canal,  or perhaps an arm of the Nile. Low stone walls divide the garden into  symmetrical compartments, like those which are seen to this day in the  great gardens of Ekhmim or Girgeh.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Plan of a Theban house with garden, from  Eighteenth Dynasty tomb-painting.]    In the centre is a large trellis supported on four rows of slender pillars.  Four small ponds, two to the right and two to the left, are stocked with  ducks and geese. Two nurseries, two summer-houses, and various avenues of  sycamores, date-palms, and dom-palms fill up the intermediate space; while  at the end, facing the entrance, stands a small three-storied house  surmounted by a painted cornice.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Perspective view of the Theban house, from  Eighteenth Dynasty tomb-painting.]    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Part of the palace of Ai, from tomb-painting,  Eighteenth Dynasty, El Amarna.]    The second plan is copied from one of the rock-cut tombs of Tell el Amarna  (figs. 16, 17). Here we see a house situate at the end of the gardens of  the great lord Ai, son-in-law of the Pharaoh Khuenaten, and himself  afterwards king of Egypt. An oblong stone tank with sloping sides, and two  descending flights of steps, faces the entrance. The building is  rectangular, the width being somewhat greater than the depth. A large  doorway opens in the middle of the front, and gives access to a court  planted with trees and flanked by store-houses fully stocked with  provisions. Two small courts, placed symmetrically in the two farthest  corners, contain the staircases which lead up to the roof terrace. This  first building, however, is but the frame which surrounds the owner's  dwelling. The two frontages are each adorned with a pillared portico and a  pylon. Passing the outer door, we enter a sort of long central passage,  divided by two walls pierced with doorways, so as to form three successive  courts. The inside court is bordered by chambers; the two others open to  right and left upon two smaller courts, whence flights of steps lead up to  the terraced roof. This central building is called the _Akhonuti_, or  private dwelling of kings or nobles, to which only the family and intimate  friends had access. The number of storeys and the arrangement of the facade  varied according to the taste of the owner. The frontage was generally a  straight wall. Sometimes it was divided into three parts, with the middle  division projecting, in which case the two wings were ornamented with a  colonnade to each storey (fig. 18), or surmounted by an open gallery (fig.  19). The central pavilion sometimes presents the appearance of a tower,  which dominates the rest of the building (fig. 20). The facade is often  decorated with slender colonnettes of painted wood, which bear no weight,  and merely serve to lighten the somewhat severe aspect of the exterior. Of  the internal arrangements, we know but little. As in the middle-class  houses, the sleeping rooms were probably small and dark; but, on the other  hand, the reception rooms must have been nearly as large as those still in  use in the Arab houses of modern Egypt.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Perspective view of the Palace of AT, Eighteenth  Dynasty, El Amarna.]    [Illustration: Fig. 18.--Frontage of house, second Theban period.]    [Illustration: Fig. 19.--Frontage of house, second Theban period.]    [Illustration: Fig. 20.--Central pavilion of house, in form of tower,  second Theban period.]    The decoration of walls and ceilings in no wise resembled such scenes or  designs as we find in the tombs. The panels were whitewashed or colour-  washed, and bordered with a polychrome band. The ceilings were usually left  white; sometimes, however they were decorated with geometrical patterns,  which repeated the leading motives employed in the sepulchral wall-  paintings. Thus we find examples of meanders interspersed with rosettes  (fig. 21), parti-coloured squares (fig. 22), ox-heads seen frontwise,  scrolls, and flights of geese (fig. 23).    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Ceiling pattern from behind, Medinet Habu,  Twentieth Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 22.--Ceiling pattern similar to one at El Bersheh,  Twelfth Dynasty.]    I have touched chiefly upon houses of the second Theban period,[2] this  being in fact the time of which we have most examples. The house-shaped  lamps which are found in such large numbers in the Fayum date only from  Roman times; but the Egyptians of that period continued to build according  to the rules which were in force under the Pharaohs of the Twelfth,  Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth Dynasties. As regards the domestic  architecture of the ancient kingdom, the evidences are few and obscure.  Nevertheless, the stelae, tombs, and coffins of that period often furnish  designs which show us the style of the doorways (fig. 24), and one Fourth  Dynasty sarcophagus, that of Khufu Poskhu, is carved in the likeness of a  house (fig. 25).      [1] Many of the rooms at Kahun had vaulted ceilings.    [2] Seventeenth to Twentieth Dynasties.          2.--FORTRESSES.    Most of the towns, and even most of the larger villages, of ancient Egypt  were walled. This was an almost necessary consequence of the geographical  characteristics and the political constitution of the country. The mouths  of the defiles which led into the desert needed to be closed against the  Bedawin; while the great feudal nobles fortified their houses, their towns,  and the villages upon their domains which commanded either the mountain  passes or the narrow parts of the river, against their king or their  neighbours.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Ceiling pattern from tomb of Aimadua, Twentieth  Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 24.--Door of a house of the Ancient Empire, from the  wall of a tomb of the Sixth Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Facade of a Fourth Dynasty house, from the  sarcophagus of Khufu Poskhu.]    The oldest fortresses are those of Abydos, El Kab, and Semneh. Abydos  contained a sanctuary dedicated to Osiris, and was situate at the entrance  to one of the roads leading to the Oasis. As the renown of the temple  attracted pilgrims, so the position of the city caused it to be frequented  by merchants; hence the prosperity which it derived from the influx of both  classes of strangers exposed the city to incursions of the Libyan tribes.  At Abydos there yet remain two almost perfect strongholds. The older forms,  as it were, the core of that tumulus called by the Arabs \"Kom es Sultan,\"  or \"the Mound of the King.\" The interior of this building has been  excavated to a point some ten or twelve feet above the ground level, but  the walls outside have not yet been cleared from the surrounding sand and  rubbish. In its present condition, it forms a parallelogram of crude  brickwork measuring 410 feet from north to south, and 223 feet from east to  west. The main axis of the structure extends, therefore, from north to  south. The principal gateway opens in the western wall, not far from the  northwest corner: but there would appear to have been two smaller gates,  one in the south front, and one in the east. The walls, which now stand  from twenty-four to thirty-six feet high, have lost somewhat of their  original height. They are about six feet thick at the top. They were not  built all together in uniform layers, but in huge vertical panels, easily  distinguished by the arrangement of the brickwork. In one division the  bedding of the bricks is strictly horizontal; in the next it is slightly  concave, and forms a very flat reversed arch, of which the extrados rests  upon the ground. The alternation of these two methods is regularly  repeated. The object of this arrangement is obscure; but it is said that  buildings thus constructed are especially fitted to resist earthquake  shocks. However this may be, the fortress is extremely ancient, for in the  Fifth Dynasty, the nobles of Abydos took possession of the interior, and,  ultimately, so piled it up with their graves as to deprive it of all  strategic value. A second stronghold, erected a few hundred yards further  to the south-east, replaced that of Kom es Sultan about the time of the  Twelfth Dynasty, and narrowly escaped the fate of the first, under the rule  of the Ramessides.
