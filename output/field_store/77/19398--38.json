Is this to be acquired by playing the notes?  But how then is it to be learned?    One thing more. Owing to an over-zeal for education, children are kept  in school from seven to ten hours in a day, and then they are required  to work and commit to memory in their free hours, when they ought to be  enjoying the fresh air. But when are they then to have their piano  lessons? After they have escaped from the school-room, and consequently  when the children are exhausted and their nerves unstrung. What cruelty!  Instead of bread and butter and fresh air, piano lessons! The piano  ought to be studied with unimpaired vigor, and with great attention and  interest, otherwise no success is to be expected. Besides this, much  writing, in itself, makes stiff, inflexible fingers. But when is the  child to find time for the necessary practice of the piano lessons?  Well, in the evening, after ten o'clock for refreshment, while papa and  mamma are in bed! And now, after the school-days are happily over, and  the children have possibly retained their red cheeks, then their  occupations in life lay claim to their time; or, if they are girls, they  are expected to busy themselves with embroidery, knitting, sewing,  crochet, making clothes, house-work, tea parties, and alas! with balls;  and now, too, comes the time for lovers. Do you imagine that the fingers  of pupils sixteen years old can learn mechanical movements as easily as  those of children nine years old? In order to satisfy the present  demands in any degree, the technique should be settled at sixteen. Under  all these circumstances, we find the best teachers become discouraged,  and fall into a dull routine, which truly can lead to no success.    In conclusion, I beg you to invite the piano teacher, Mr. Strict, to  whom you have confided the instruction of your only daughter, Rosalie,  to pay me a visit, and I will give him particular directions for a  gradual development in piano-playing, up to Beethoven's op. 109 or  Chopin's F minor concerto. But I shall find him too fixed in his own  theories, too much of a composer, too conceited and dogmatic, and not  sufficiently practical, to be a good teacher, or to exert much  influence; and, indeed, he has himself a stiff, restless, clumsy touch,  that expends half its efforts in the air. He talks bravely of etudes,  scales, &c.; but the question with regard to these is _how they are  taught_. The so-called practising of exercises, without having  previously formed a sure touch, and carefully and skilfully fostering it  is not much more useful than playing pieces. But I hear him reply, with  proud and learned self-consciousness: \"Music, music! Classical,  classical! Spirit! Expression! Bach, Beethoven, Mendelssohn!\" That is  just the difficulty. Look at his pupils, at his pianists! See how his  children are musically stifled, and hear his daughter sing the classical  arias composed by himself! However, it is all musical! Farewell.          CHAPTER IV.    A CONVERSATION WITH MRS. SOLID, AND FOUR LESSONS TO HER DAUGHTER.      MRS. SOLID. I should be glad to understand how it is that your daughters  are able to play the numerous pieces which I have heard from them so  correctly and intelligently, without bungling or hesitation, and with so  much expression, and the most delicate shading; in fact, in such a  masterly manner. From my youth upwards, I have had tolerable  instruction. I have played scales and etudes for a long time; and have  taken great pleasure in studying and industriously practising numerous  compositions of Kalkbrenner and Hummel, under their own direction. I  have even been celebrated for my talent; but, nevertheless, I never have  had the pleasure of being able to execute any considerable piece of  music to my own satisfaction or that of others; and I fear it will be  the same with my daughter Emily.    DOMINIE. In order to give a satisfactory answer to your question, I will  lay before you a few of my principles and opinions in respect to  musical culture, with special reference to piano-playing. Educated  ladies of the present time make greater pretensions and greater demands  than formerly in regard to music and musical execution; and consequently  their own performances do not usually correspond with their more or less  cultivated taste for the beautiful, which has been awakened by their  careful general education. Thus they are aware that they are not able to  give satisfaction, either to themselves or to others; and from this  arises a want of that confidence in their own powers, which should  amount almost to a consciousness of infallibility, in order to produce a  satisfactory musical performance. This confidence has its foundation in  a full, firm, clear, and musical touch, the acquisition of which has  been, and is still, too much neglected by masters and teachers. A  correct mechanical facility and its advanced cultivation rest upon this  basis alone; which, moreover, requires special attention upon our softly  leathered pianos, which are much more difficult to play upon than the  old-fashioned instruments. It is a mistake to suppose that a correct  touch, which alone can produce a good execution, will come of itself,  through the practice of etudes and scales. Even with masters, it is  unusual to meet with a sound, fine, unexceptionable touch, like that of  Field and Moscheles, and among the more recent that of Thalberg, Chopin,  Mendelssohn, and Henselt.    I will speak now of the selection of pieces. Our ladies are not  contented to play simple music, which presents few difficulties and  requires no involved fingering; and from which they might gradually  advance by correct and persevering study to more difficult pieces. They  at once seize upon grand compositions by Beethoven, C.M. von Weber,  Mendelssohn, Chopin, and others, and select also, for the sake of  variety, the bravoura pieces of Liszt, Thalberg, Henselt, &c. How can  they expect to obtain a command of such pieces, when their early  education was insufficient for our exalted demands in mechanical skill,  and their subsequent instruction has also been faulty and without  method?    If you were to request me to supply in some degree your own  deficiencies, before I proceed to the further education of your  daughter, I should not begin with the wisdom of our friend Mr. Buffalo:  \"Madam, you must every day practise the major and minor scales, in all  the keys, with both hands at once, and also in thirds and in sixths; and  you must work three or four hours daily at etudes of Clementi, Cramer,  and Moscheles; otherwise, your playing will never amount to any thing.\"    Such advice has frequently been given by teachers like Mr. Buffalo, and  is still daily insisted on; but we will, for the present, set such  nonsense aside. I shall, in the first place, endeavor to improve your  touch, which is too thin, feeble, and incorrect; which makes too much  unnecessary movement, and tries to produce the tone in the air, instead  of drawing it out with the keys. This will not require a long time, for  I have well-formed, young hands to work upon, with skilful fingers in  good condition. I will employ, for this purpose, several of the short  exercises mentioned in my first chapter, and shall require them to be  transposed into various keys, and played without notes, in order that  you may give your whole attention to your hands and fingers. Above all  things, I wish you to observe how I try to bring out from the piano the  most beautiful possible tone, with a quiet movement of the fingers and a  correct position of the hand; without an uneasy jerking of the arm, and  with ease, lightness, and sureness. I shall certainly insist upon scales  also, for it is necessary to pay great care and attention to passing the  thumb under promptly and quietly, and to the correct, easy position of  the arm. But I shall be content with the practice of scales for a  quarter of an hour each day, which I require to be played, according to  my discretion, _staccato_, _legato_, fast, slow, _forte_, _piano_, with  one hand or with both hands, according to circumstances. This short time  daily for scale-practice is sufficient, provided, always, that I have no  stiff fingers, or unpractised or ruined structure of the hand to  educate. For very young beginners with weak fingers, the scales should  be practised only _piano_, until the fingers acquire strength.    I should continue in this way with you for two weeks, but every day with  some slight change. After a short time, I would combine with this  practice the study of two or three pieces, suitably arranged for the  piano; for example, Mozart's minuet in E flat, arranged by Schulhoff,  and his drinking-song, or similar pieces. We will, at present, have  nothing to do with Beethoven. You are, perhaps, afraid that all this  might be tedious; but I have never been considered tedious in my  lessons. I wish you, for the present, not to practise any pieces or  exercises except in my presence, until a better touch has been  thoroughly established. You must also give up entirely, for a time,  playing your previous pieces; for they would give you opportunity to  fall again into your faulty mode of playing. I shall also soon put in  practice one of my maxims in teaching; viz., that, merely for the  acquisition of mechanical facility, all my pupils shall be in the habit  of playing daily some appropriate piece, that by its perfect mastery  they may gain a fearless confidence. They must regard this piece as a  companion, friend, and support. I wish you to learn to consider it a  necessity every day, before practising or studying your new piece of  music, to play this piece, even if it is done quite mechanically, two or  three times, first slowly, then faster; for without ready, flexible  fingers, my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16667"],[0,"Young Folks' History of Rome (#5)"],[1," betrothed to one of the Curiatii, and was in agony  to know his fate; and when she saw the garment she had spun for him  hanging blood-stained over her brother's shoulders, she burst into loud  lamentations. Horatius, still hot with fury, struck her dead on the  spot, crying, \"So perish every Roman who mourns the death of an enemy of  his country.\" Even her father approved the cruel deed, and would not  bury her in his family tomb--so stern were Roman feelings, putting the  honor of the country above everything. However, Horatius was brought  before the king for the murder, and was sentenced to die; but the people  entreated that their champion might be spared, and he was only made to  pass under what was called the yoke, namely, spears set up like a  doorway.    Tullus Hostilius gained several victories over his neighbors, but he was  harsh and presuming, and offended the gods, and, when he was using some  spell such as good Numa had used to hold converse with Jupiter, the  angry god sent lightning and burnt up him and his family. The people  then chose Ancus Martins, the son of Numa's daughter, who is said to  have ruled in his grandfather's spirit, though he could not avoid wars  with the Latins. The first bridge over the Tiber, named the Sublician,  was said to have been built by him. In his time there came to Rome a  family called Tarquin. Their father was a Corinthian, who had settled in  an Etruscan town named Tarquinii, whence came the family name. He was  said to have first taught writing in Italy, and, indeed, the Roman  letters which we still use are Greek letters made simpler. His eldest  son, finding that because of his foreign blood he could rise to no  honors in Etruria, set off with his wife Tanaquil, and their little son  Lucius Tarquinius, to settle in Rome. Just as they came in sight of  Rome, an eagle swooped down from the sky, snatched off little Tarquin's  cap, and flew up with it, but the next moment came down again and put it  back on his head. On this Tanaquil foretold that her son would be a  great king, and he became so famous a warrior when he grew up, that, as  the children of Ancus were too young to reign at their father's death,  he was chosen king. He is said to have been the first Roman king who  wore a purple robe and golden crown, and in the valley between the  Palatine and Aventine Hills he made a circus, where games could be held  like those of the Greeks; also he placed stone benches and stalls for  shops round the Forum, and built a stone wall instead of a mud one round  the city. He is commonly called Tarquinus Priscus, or the elder.    [Illustration: ACTORS]    There was a fair slave girl in his house, who was offering cakes to Lar,  the household spirit, when he appeared to her in bodily form. When she  told the king's mother, Tanaquil, she said it was a token that he wanted  to marry her, and arrayed her as a bride for him. Of this marriage  there sprang a boy called Servius Tullus. When this child lay asleep,  bright flames played about his head, and Tanaquil knew he would be  great, so she caused her son Tarquin to give him his daughter in  marriage when he grew up. This greatly offended the two sons of Ancus  Martius, and they hired two young men to come before him as  wood-cutters, with axes over their shoulders, pretending to have a  quarrel about some goats, and while he was listening to their cause they  cut him down and mortally wounded him. He had lost his sons, and had  only two baby grandsons, Aruns and Tarquin, who could not reign as yet;  but while he was dying, Tanaquil stood at the window and declared that  he was only stunned and would soon be well. This, as she intended, so  frightened the sons of Ancus that they fled from Rome; and Servius  Tullus, coming forth in the royal robes, was at once hailed as king by  all the people of Rome, being thus made king that he might protect his  wife's two young nephews, the two little Tarquins.          CHAPTER V.    THE DRIVING OUT OF THE TARQUINS.    B.C. 578--309.      Servius Tullus was looked on by the Romans as having begun making their  laws, as Romulus had put their warlike affairs in order, and Numa had  settled their religion. The Romans were all in great clans or families,  all with one name, and these were classed in tribes. The nobler ones,  who could count up from old Trojan, Latin, or Sabine families, were  called Patricians--from _pater_, a father--because they were fathers of  the people; and the other families were called Plebeian, from _plebs_,  the people. The patricians formed the Senate or Council of Government,  and rode on horseback in war, while the plebeians fought on foot. They  had spears, round shields, and short pointed swords, which cut on each  side of the blade. Tullus is said to have fixed how many men of each  tribe should be called out to war. He also walled in the city again with  a wall five miles round; and he made many fixed laws, one being that  when a man was in debt his goods might be seized, but he himself might  not be made a slave. He was the great friend of the plebeians, and first  established the rule that a new law of the Senate could not be made  without the consent of the Comitia, or whole free people.    The Sabines and Romans were still striving for the mastery, and a  husbandman among the Sabines had a wonderfully beautiful cow. An oracle  declared that the man who sacrificed this cow to Diana upon the Aventine  Hill would secure the chief power to his nation. The Sabine drove the  cow to Rome, and was going to kill her, when a crafty Roman priest told  him that he must first wash his hands in the Tiber, and while he was  gone sacrificed the cow himself, and by this trick secured the rule to  Rome. The great horns of the cow were long after shown in the temple of  Diana on the Aventine, where Romans, Sabines, and Latins every year  joined in a great sacrifice.    The two daughters of Servius were married to their cousins, the two  young Tarquins. In each pair there was a fierce and a gentle one. The  fierce Tullia was the wife of the gentle Aruns Tarquin; the gentle Tulla  had married the proud Lucius Tarquin. Aruns' wife tried to persuade her  husband to seize the throne that had belonged to his father, and when he  would not listen to her, she agreed with his brother Lucius that, while  he murdered her sister, she should kill his brother, and then that they  should marry. The horrid deed was carried out, and old Servius, seeing  what a wicked pair were likely to come after him, began to consider with  the Senate whether it would not be better to have two consuls or  magistrates chosen every year than a king. This made Lucius Tarquin the  more furious, and going to the Senate, where the patricians hated the  king as the friend of the plebeians, he stood upon the throne, and was  beginning to tell the patricians that this would be the ruin of their  greatness, when Servius came in and, standing on the steps of the  doorway, ordered him to come down. Tarquin sprang on the old man and  hurled him backward, so that the fall killed him, and his body was left  in the street. The wicked Tullia, wanting to know how her husband had  sped, came out in her chariot on that road. The horses gave back before  the corpse. She asked what was in their way; the slave who drove her  told her it was the king's body. \"Drive on,\" she said. The horrid deed  caused the street to be known ever after as \"Sceleratus,\" or the wicked.  But it was the plebeians who mourned for Servius; the patricians in  their anger made Tarquin king, but found him a very hard and cruel  master, so that he is generally called Tarquinius Superbus, or Tarquin  the proud. In his time the Sybil of Cumae, the same wondrous maiden of  deep wisdom who had guided AEneas to the realms of Pluto, came, bringing  nine books of prophecies of the history of Rome, and offered them to him  at a price which he thought too high, and refused. She went away,  destroyed three, and brought back the other six, asking for them double  the price of the whole. He refused. She burnt three more, and brought  him the last three with the price again doubled, because the fewer they  were, the more precious. He bought them at last, and placed them in the  Capitol, whence they were now and then taken to be consulted as oracles.    [Illustration: SYBIL'S CAVE.]    Rome was at war with the city of Gabii, and as the city was not to be  subdued by force, Tarquin tried treachery. His eldest son, Sextus  Tarquinius, fled to Gabii, complaining of ill-usage of his father, and  showing marks of a severe scourging. The Gabians believed him, and he  was soon so much trusted by them as to have the whole command of the  army and manage everything in the city. Then he sent a messenger to his  father to ask what he was to do next. Tarquin was walking through a  cornfield. He made no answer in words, but with a switch cut off the  heads of all the poppies and taller stalks of corn, and bade the  messenger tell Sextus what he had seen. Sextus understood, and  contrived to get all the chief men of Gabii exiled or put to death, and  without them the city fell an easy prey to the Romans.    Tarquin sent his two younger sons and their cousin to consult the oracle  at Delphi, and with them went Lucius Junius, who was called Brutus  because he was supposed to be foolish, that being the meaning of the  word; but his folly was only put on, because he feared the jealousy of  his cousins. After doing their father's errand, the two Tarquins asked  who should rule Rome after their father. \"He,\" said the priestess, \"who  shall first kiss his mother on his return.\" The two brothers agreed that  they would keep this a secret from their elder brother Sextus, and, as  soon as they reached home, both of them rushed into the women's rooms,  racing each to be the first to embrace their mother Tullia; but at the  very entrance of Rome Brutus pretended to slip, threw"]]]
