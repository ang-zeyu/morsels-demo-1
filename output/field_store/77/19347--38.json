Where then was the Sun at that moment? Obviously  in the underworld beneath our feet. Whatever views the ancients may have  had about the shape of the earth, it was evident to the mass of people  that the Sungod, after illuminating the world during the day, plunged  down in the West, and remained there during the hours of darkness in  some cavern under the earth. Here he rested and after bathing in the  great ocean renewed his garments before reappearing in the East next  morning.    But in this long night of his greatest winter weakness, when all the  world was hoping and praying for the renewal of his strength, it is  evident that the new birth would come--if it came at all--at midnight.  This then was the sacred hour when in the underworld (the Stable or the  Cave or whatever it might be called) the child was born who was destined  to be the Savior of men. At that moment Sirius stood on the southern  meridian (and in more southern lands than ours this would be more nearly  overhead); and that star--there is little doubt--is the Star in the East  mentioned in the Gospels.    To the right, as the supposed observer looks at Sirius on the midnight  of Christmas Eve, stands the magnificent Orion, the mighty hunter. There  are three stars in his belt which, as is well known, lie in a straight  line pointing to Sirius. They are not so bright as Sirius, but they are  sufficiently bright to attract attention. A long tradition gives them  the name of the Three Kings. Dupuis (1) says: \"Orion a trois belles  etoiles vers le milieu, qui sont de seconde grandeur et posees en ligne  droite, l'une pres de l'autre, le peuple les appelle les trois rois.  On donne aux trois rois Magis les noms de Magalat, Galgalat, Saraim;  et Athos, Satos, Paratoras. Les Catholiques les appellent Gaspard,  Melchior, et Balthasar.\" The last-mentioned group of names comes in  the Catholic Calendar in connection with the feast of the Epiphany (6th  January); and the name \"Trois Rois\" is commonly to-day given to these  stars by the French and Swiss peasants.     (1) Charles F. Dupuis (Origine de Tous les Cultes, Paris, 1822)  was one of the earliest modern writers on these subjects.      Immediately after Midnight then, on the 25th December, the Beloved Son  (or Sun-god) is born. If we go back in thought to the period, some three  thousand years ago, when at that moment of the heavenly birth Sirius,  coming from the East, did actually stand on the Meridian, we shall come  into touch with another curious astronomical coincidence. For at the  same moment we shall see the Zodiacal constellation of the Virgin in  the act of rising, and becoming visible in the East divided through the  middle by the line of the horizon.    The constellation Virgo is a Y-shaped group, of which [gr a], the star  at the foot, is the well-known Spica, a star of the first magnitude. The  other principal stars, [gr g] at the centre, and [gr b] and [gr e] at  the extremities, are of the second magnitude. The whole resembles more a  cup than the human figure; but when we remember the symbolic meaning  of the cup, that seems to be an obvious explanation of the name Virgo,  which the constellation has borne since the earliest times. (The three  stars [gr b], [gr g] and [gr a], lie very nearly on the Ecliptic, that  is, the Sun's path--a fact to which we shall return presently.)    At the moment then when Sirius, the star from the East, by coming to the  Meridian at midnight signalled the Sun's new birth, the Virgin was seen  just rising on the Eastern sky--the horizon line passing through  her centre. And many people think that this astronomical fact is the  explanation of the very widespread legend of the Virgin-birth. I do not  think that it is the sole explanation--for indeed in all or nearly all  these cases the acceptance of a myth seems to depend not upon a single  argument but upon the convergence of a number of meanings and reasons in  the same symbol. But certainly the fact mentioned above is curious, and  its importance is accentuated by the following considerations.    In the Temple of Denderah in Egypt, and on the inside of the dome,  there is or WAS an elaborate circular representation of the Northern  hemisphere of the sky and the Zodiac. (1) Here Virgo the constellation  is represented, as in our star-maps, by a woman with a spike of corn in  her hand (Spica). But on the margin close by there is an annotating and  explicatory figure--a figure of Isis with the infant Horus in her arms,  and quite resembling in style the Christian Madonna and Child, except  that she is sitting and the child is on her knee. This seems to show  that--whatever other nations may have done in associating Virgo with  Demeter, Ceres, Diana (2) etc.--the Egyptians made no doubt of the  constellation's connection with Isis and Horus. But it is well known as  a matter of history that the worship of Isis and Horus descended in the  early Christian centuries to Alexandria, where it took the form of the  worship of the Virgin Mary and the infant Savior, and so passed into  the European ceremonial. We have therefore the Virgin Mary connected by  linear succession and descent with that remote Zodiacal cluster in the  sky! Also it may be mentioned that on the Arabian and Persian globes of  Abenezra and Abuazar a Virgin and Child are figured in connection with  the same constellation. (3)     (1) Carefully described and mapped by Dupuis, see op. cit.     (2) For the harvest-festival of Diana, the Virgin, and her  parallelism with the Virgin Mary, see The Golden Bough, vol. i, 14 and  ii, 121.     (3) See F. Nork, Der Mystagog (Leipzig, 1838).      A curious confirmation of the same astronomical connection is afforded  by the Roman Catholic Calendar. For if this be consulted it will be  found that the festival of the Assumption of the Virgin is placed on the  15th August, while the festival of the Birth of the Virgin is dated the  8th September. I have already pointed out that the stars, [gr a], [gr  b] and [gr g] of Virgo are almost exactly on the Ecliptic, or Sun's path  through the sky; and a brief reference to the Zodiacal signs and the  star-maps will show that the Sun each year enters the sign of Virgo  about the first-mentioned date, and leaves it about the second date. At  the present day the Zodiacal signs (owing to precession) have shifted  some distance from the constellations of the same name. But at the time  when the Zodiac was constituted and these names were given, the first  date obviously would signalize the actual disappearance of the cluster  Virgo in the Sun's rays--i. e. the Assumption of the Virgin into the  glory of the God--while the second date would signalize the reappearance  of the constellation or the Birth of the Virgin. The Church of Notre  Dame at Paris is supposed to be on the original site of a Temple of  Isis; and it is said (but I have not been able to verify this myself)  that one of the side entrances--that, namely, on the left in entering  from the North (cloister) side--is figured with the signs of the Zodiac  EXCEPT that the sign Virgo is replaced by the figure of the Madonna and  Child.    So strange is the scripture of the sky! Innumerable legends and customs  connect the rebirth of the Sun with a Virgin parturition. Dr. J. G.  Frazer in his Part IV of The Golden Bough (1) says: \"If we may trust the  evidence of an obscure scholiast the Greeks (in the worship of Mithras  at Rome) used to celebrate the birth of the luminary by a midnight  service, coming out of the inner shrines and crying, 'The Virgin has  brought forth! The light is waxing!' ([gr 'H parhenos tetoken, auzei  pws].)\" In Elie Reclus' little book Primitive Folk (2) it is said of the  Esquimaux that \"On the longest night of the year two angakout (priests),  of whom one is disguised as a WOMAN, go from hut to hut extinguishing  all the lights, rekindling them from a vestal flame, and crying out,  'From the new sun cometh a new light!'\"     (1) Book II, ch. vi.     (2) In the Contemporary Science Series, I. 92.      All this above-written on the Solar or Astronomical origins of the myths  does not of course imply that the Vegetational origins must be denied  or ignored. These latter were doubtless the earliest, but there is no  reason--as said in the Introduction (ch. i)--why the two elements should  not to some extent have run side by side, or been fused with each other.  In fact it is quite clear that they must have done so; and to separate  them out too rigidly, or treat them as antagonistic, is a mistake. The  Cave or Underworld in which the New Year is born is not only the place  of the Sun's winter retirement, but also the hidden chamber beneath the  Earth to which the dying Vegetation goes, and from which it re-arises  in Spring. The amours of Adonis with Venus and Proserpine, the lovely  goddesses of the upper and under worlds, or of Attis with Cybele, the  blooming Earth-mother, are obvious vegetation-symbols; but they do not  exclude the interpretation that Adonis (Adonai) may also figure as a  Sun-god. The Zodiacal constellations of Aries and Taurus (to which I  shall return presently) rule in heaven just when the Lamb and the Bull  are in evidence on the earth; and the yearly sacrifice of those two  animals and of the growing Corn for the good of mankind runs  parallel with the drama of the sky, as it affects not only the said  constellations but also Virgo (the Earth-mother who bears the sheaf of  corn in her hand).    I shall therefore continue (in the next chapter) to point out these  astronomical references--which are full of significance and poetry; but  with a recommendation at the same time to the reader not to forget the  poetry and significance of the terrestrial interpretations.    Between Christmas Day and Easter there are several minor festivals or  holy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#5)"],[1,"second it is only 1500 feet, and soon it comes to rest.  We cannot compact force enough behind a bit of lead to keep it  flying. But light flies unweariedly and without diminution of speed.  When it has come from the sun in eight minutes, Alpha Centauri  in three years, Polaris in forty-five years, other stars in one  thousand, its wings are in nowise fatigued, nor is the rapidity  of its flight slackened in the least.    It is not the transactions of to-day that we read in the heavens,  but it is history, some of it older than the time of Adam. Those  stars may have been smitten out of existence decades of centuries  ago, but their poured-out light is yet flooding the heavens.    It goes both ways at once in the same place, without interference.  We see the light reflected from the new moon to the earth; reflected  back from the house-tops, fields, and waters of earth, to the moon  again, and from the moon to us once more--three times in opposite  directions, in the same place, without interference, and thus we  see \"the old moon in the arms of the new.\"    _Constitution of Light._    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--White Light resolved into Colors.]    Light was once supposed to be corpuscular, or consisting of transmitted  particles. It is now known to be the result of undulations in ether.  Reference has been made to the minuteness of these undulations.  Their velocity is equally wonderful. Put a prism of glass into  a ray of light coming into a dark room, and it is [Page 25]  instantly turned out of its course, some parts more and some less,  according to the number of vibrations, and appears as the seven  colors on different parts of the screen. Fig. 6 shows the  arrangement of colors, and the number of millions of millions of  vibrations per second of each. But the different divisions we call  colors are not colors in themselves at all, but simply a different  number of vibrations. Color is all in the eye. Violet has in  different places from 716 to 765,000,000,000,000 of vibrations per  second; red has, in different places, from 396 to  470,000,000,000,000 vibrations per second. None of these in any  sense are color, but affect the eye differently, and we call these  different effects color. They are simply various velocities of  vibration. An object, like one kind of stripe in our flag, which  absorbs all kinds of vibrations except those between 396 and  470,000,000,000,000, and reflects those, appears red to us. The  field for the stars absorbs and destroys all but those vibrations  numbering about 653,000,000,000,000 of [Page 25] vibrations per  second. A color is a constant creation. Light makes momentary color  in the flag. Drake might have written, in the continuous present as  well as in the past,     \"Freedom mingles with its gorgeous dyes    The milky baldrick of the skies,    And stripes its pore celestial white    With streakings of the morning light.\"    Every little pansy, tender as fancy, pearled with evanescent dew,  fresh as a new creation of sunbeams, has power to suppress in one  part of its petals all vibrations we call red, in another those  we call yellow, and purple, and reflect each of these in other  parts of the same tender petal. \"Pansies are for thoughts,\" even  more thoughts than poor Ophelia knew. An evening cloud that is  dense enough to absorb all the faster and weaker vibrations, leaving  only the stronger to come through, will be said to be red; because  the vibrations that produce the impression we have so named are  the only ones that have vigor enough to get through. It is like an  army charging upon a fortress. Under the deadly fire and fearful  obstructions six-sevenths go down, but one-seventh comes through  with the glory of victory upon its face.    Light comes in undulations to the eye, as tones of sound to the  ear. Must not light also sing? The lowest tone we can hear is made  by 16.5 vibrations of air per second; the highest, so shrill and  \"fine that nothing lives 'twixt it and silence,\" is made by 38,000  vibrations per second. Between these extremes lie eleven octaves;  C of the G clef having 258-7/8 vibrations to the second, and its  octave above 517-1/2. Not that sound vibrations cease [Page 27] at  38,000, but our organs are not fitted to hear beyond those  limitations. If our ears were delicate enough, we could hear even up  to the almost infinite vibrations of light. In one of those  semi-inspirations we find in Shakspeare's works, he says--     \"There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdest,    But in his motion like an angel sings,    Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim.    Such harmony is in immortal souls;    But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.\"    And that older poetry which is always highest truth says, \"The  morning stars sing together.\" We misconstrued another passage which  we could not understand, and did not dare translate as it was written,  till science crept up to a perception of the truth that had been  standing there for ages, waiting a mind that could take it in.  Now we read as it is written--\"Thou makest the out-goings of the  morning and evening to sing.\" Were our senses fine enough, we could  hear the separate keynote of every individual star. Stars differ  in glory and in power, and so in the volume and pitch of their  song. Were our hearing sensitive enough, we could hear not only  the separate key-notes but the infinite swelling harmony of these  myriad stars of the sky, as they pour their mighty tide of united  anthems in the ear of God:     \"In reason's ear they all rejoice,    And utter forth a glorious voice.    Forever singing, as they shine,    The hand that made us is divine.\"    This music is not monotonous. Stars draw near each other, and make  a light that is unapproachable by mortals; [Page 28] then the music  swells beyond our ability to endure. They recede far away, making a  light so dim that the music dies away, so near to silence that only  spirits can perceive it. No wonder God rejoices in his works. They  pour into his ear one ceaseless tide of rapturous song.    Our senses are limited--we have only five, but there is room for  many more. Some time we shall be taken out of \"this muddy vesture  of decay,\" no longer see the universe through crevices of our  prison-house, but shall range through wider fields, explore deeper  mysteries, and discover new worlds, hints of which have never yet  been blown across the wide Atlantic that rolls between them and  men abiding in the flesh.    _Chemistry of Suns revealed by Light._    When we examine the assemblage of colors spread from the white ray  of sunlight, we do not find red simple red, yellow yellow, etc.,  but there is a vast number of fine microscopic lines of various  lengths, parallel--here near together, there far apart, always the  same number and the same relative distance, when the same light  and prism are used. What new alphabets to new realms of knowledge  are these! Remember, that what we call colors are only various  numbers of vibrations of ether. Remember, that every little group in  the infinite variety of these vibrations may be affected differently  from every other group. One number of these is bent by the prism  to where we see what we call the violet, another number to the  place we call red. All of the vibrations are destroyed when they  strike a surface we call black. A part of them are destroyed when  [Page 29] they strike a substance we call colored. The rest are  reflected, and give the impression of color. In one place on the  flag of our nation all vibrations are destroyed except the red; in  another, all but the blue. Perhaps on that other gorgeous flag, not  of our country but of our sun, the flag we call the solar spectrum,  all vibrations are destroyed where these dark lines appear. Perhaps  this effect is not produced by the surface upon which the rays fall,  but by some specific substance in the sun. This is just the truth.  Light passing through vapor of sodium has the vibrations that would  fall on two narrow lines in the yellow utterly destroyed, leaving  two black spaces. Light passing through vapor of burning iron has  some four hundred numbers or kinds of vibrations destroyed, leaving  that number of black lines; but if the salt or iron be glowing gas,  in the source of the light itself the same lines are bright instead  of dark.    Thus we have brought to our doors a readable record of the very  substances composing every world hot enough to shine by its own  light. Thus, while our flag means all we have of liberty, free as  the winds that kiss it, and bright as the stars that shine in it,  the flag of the sun means all that it is in constituent elements,  all that it is in condition.    We find in our sun many substances known to exist in the earth,  and some that we had not discovered when the sun wrote their names,  or rather made their mark, in the spectrum. Thus, also, we find  that Betelguese and Algol are without any perceivable indications  of hydrogen, and Sirius has it in abundance. What a sense of  acquaintanceship it gives us to look up and recognize [Page 30] the  stars whose very substance we know! If we were transported thither,  or beyond, we should not be altogether strangers in an unknown  realm.    But the stars differ in their constituent elements; every ray that  flashes from them bears in its very being proofs of what they are.  Hence the eye of Omniscience, seeing a ray of light anywhere in  the universe, though gone from its source a thousand years, would  be able to tell from what orb it originally came.    _Creative Force of Light._    Just above the color vibrations of the unbraided sunbeam, above  the violet, which is the highest number our eyes can detect, is  a chemical force; it works the changes on the glass plate in  photography; it transfigures the dark, cold soil into woody fibre,  green leaf, downy rose petals, luscious fruit,"]]]
