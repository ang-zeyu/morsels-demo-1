That I might  know the present Sense of the Chief Inhabitants of that Place, I wrote  to Mr. Wilson, the Incumbent of that Town, and by his Means received  the following Letter from Mr. Rivett, a worthy Gentleman who lived  lately in the same Place, and whose Father lived there before him.    \"'SIR,    \"'In Answer to your Request concerning Mr. Lowes, my Father was always  of the opinion, that Mr. Lowes suffered wrongfully, and hath often  said, that he did believe, he was no more a Wizzard than he was. I  have heard it from them that watched with him, that _they kept him  awake several Nights together, and run him backwards and forwards  about the Room, until he was out of Breath: Then they rested him a  little, and then ran him again: And thus they did for several Days and  Nights together, till he was weary of his Life, and was scarce  sensible of what he said or did_. They swam him at Framlingham, but  that was no true Rule to try him by; for they put in honest People at  the same Time, and they swam as well as he.\"]    After the lapse of another half century, and at the very period when  the persecution against witches waxed hotter, and the public  prejudice had become only more inveterate, from the ingredient of  fanaticism having been largely thrown in as a stimulant, another ally  to the cause of compassion and common sense started up, in the person  of one whose name has rounded many a period and given point to many  an invective. To find the proscribed author of the _Patriarcha_  purging with \"euphrasy and rue\" the eyes of the dispensers of justice,  and shouldering the crowd to obtain for reason a fair and impartial  hearing, is indeed like meeting with Saul among the prophets. If there  be one name which has been doomed to run the gauntlet, and against  which every pert and insolent political declaimer has had his fling,  it is that of this unfortunate writer; yet in his short but masterly  and unanswerable \"Advertisement to the Jurymen of England, touching  Witches, together with a difference between an English and Hebrew  Witch,\" first published in 1653, 4to., he has addressed himself so  cogently and decisively to the main fallacy of the arguments in favour  of witchcraft which rested their force on Scripture misunderstood, and  has so pertinently and popularly urged the points to be considered,  that his tract must have had the greatest weight on the class to whom  his reasoning was principally addressed, and on whose fiat the fates  of his unhappy clients may be said to have hung. For this good  service, reason and common sense owe Sir Robert Filmer a debt which  does not yet appear to have been paid. The verdict of proscription  against him was pronounced by the most incompetent and superficial aera  of our literature, and no friendly appellant has yet moved the court  of posterity for its reversal. Yet without entering upon the theory of  the patriarchal scheme, which after all, perhaps, was not so  irrational as may be supposed, or discussing on an occasion like the  present the conflicting theories of government, it may be allowable to  express a doubt whether even the famous author of the \"Essay on the  Human Understanding,\" to whose culminating star the decadence of the  rival intelligence is attributable, can be shewn to have been as much  in advance of his generation in the time of king William, as from the  tract on witchcraft, and another written on a different subject, but  with equally enlightened views,[20] Sir Robert Filmer manifestly  appears to have outrun his at the period of the usurpation.[21]    [Footnote 20: I allude to his little tract on Usury.]    [Footnote 21: Between the period of the publication of Filmer's  Advertisement and the appearance of Wagstaffe's work, a tract was  published too important in this controversy to be passed over without  notice. It is entitled _A Candle in the Dark, or a Treatise concerning  the Nature of Witches and Witchcraft; being Advice to Judges,  Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and Grand Jurymen, what to do before  they passe sentence on such as are arraigned for their lives as  Witches. By Thomas Ady, M.A. London, printed for R.J., to be sold by  Thomas Newberry, at the Three Lions in Cornhill, by the Exchange,  1656_, 4to. Ady, of whom, unfortunately, nothing is known, presses the  arguments against the witchmongers and witchfinders with unanswerable  force. In fact, this tract comprises the quintessence of all that had  been urged against the popular system, and his \"Candle\" was truly a  burning and a shining light. His Dedication is too curious to be  omitted:--    \"To the Prince of the Kings of the Earth. It is the manner of men, O  heavenly King, to dedicate their books to some great men, thereby to  have their works protected and countenanced among them; but thou only  art able, by thy holy Spirit of Truth, to defend thy Truth, and to  make it take impression in the heart and understanding of men. Unto  thee alone do I dedicate this work, entreating thy Most High Majesty  to grant, that whoever shall open this book, thy holy Spirit may so  possess their understanding, as that the Spirit of errour may depart  from them, and that they may read and try thy Truth by the touchstone  of thy Truth, the holy Scriptures; and finding that Truth, may embrace  it and forsake their darksome inventions of Antichrist, that have  deluded and defiled the nations now and in former ages. Enlighten the  world, thou that art the Light of the World, and let darkness be no  more in the world, now or in any future age; but make all people to  walk as children of the Light for ever; and destroy Antichrist, that  hath deceived the nations, and save us the residue by thyself alone;  and let not Satan any more delude us, for the Truth is thine for  ever.\" He then puts his \"Dilemma that cannot be answered by  Witchmongers.\" It is too long to quote, but it is a dilemma that would  pose the stoutest Coryphaeus of the party to whom he addressed  himself.]    The next champion in this unpopular cause, John Wagstaffe, who  published \"The Question of Witchcraft Debated,\" 1669, 12mo,[22] was,  as A. a Wood informs us, \"the son of John Wagstaffe, citizen of  London, descended from those of his name of Hasland Hall, in  Derbyshire, was born in Cheapside, within the city of London, became a  commoner of Oriel College in the latter end of 1649, took the degrees  in Arts, and applied himself to the study of politics and other  learning. At length, being raised from an academical life to the  inheritance of Hasland, by the death of an uncle, who died without  male issue, he spent his life afterwards in single estate.\" His death  took place in 1677. The Oxford historian, who had little reverence for  new lights, and never loses an opportunity of girding at those whose  weights and measures were not according to the current and only  authentic standard, has left no very flattering account of his person.  \"He was a little crooked man, and of a despicable presence. He was  laughed at by the boys of this University, because, as they said, he  himself looked like a little wizard.\" Small as might be his stature,  and questionable the shape in which he appeared, he might still have  taken up the boast of the author of the _Religio Medici_: \"Men that  look upon my outside do err in my altitude, for I am above Atlas's  shoulders.\" None but a large-souled and kindly-affectioned man, whose  intellect was as comprehensive as his feelings were benevolent, could  have produced the excellent little treatise which claims him as its  author. The following is the lofty and memorable peroration in which  he sums up the strength of his cause:--    \"I cannot think without trembling and horror on the vast numbers of  people that in several ages and several countries have been sacrificed  unto this idol, Opinion. Thousands, ten thousands, are upon record to  have been slain, and many of them not with simple deaths, but horrid,  exquisite tortures. And yet, how many are there more who have  undergone the same fate, of whom we have no memorial extant. Since,  therefore, the opinion of witchcraft is a mere stranger unto  Scripture, and wholly alien from true religion; since it is ridiculous  by asserting fables and impossibilities; since it appears, when duly  considered, to be all bloody and full of dangerous consequence unto  the lives and safety of men; I hope that with this my Discourse,  opposing an absurd and pernicious error, I can not at all disoblige  any sober, unbiassed person; especially if he be of such ingenuity as  to have freed himself from a slavish subjection unto those prejudicial  opinions which custom and education do with too much tyranny  impose.--If the doctrine of witchcraft should be carried up to a  height, and the inquisition after it should be intrusted in the hands  of ambitious, covetous and malicious men, it would prove of far more  fatal consequence unto the lives and safety of mankind, than that  ancient, heathenish custom of sacrificing men unto idol gods; insomuch  that we stand in need of another Hercules Liberator, who, as the  former freed the world from human sacrifice, should, in like manner,  travel from country to country, and by his all-commanding authority,  free it from _this euil and base custom of torturing people to confess  themselves witches, and burning them after extorted confessions_.  Surely the blood of men ought not to be so cheap, nor so easily to be  shed by those who, under the name of God, do gratifie exorbitant "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269"],[0,"Pascal's Pensées (#5)"],[1," man naturally  cannot see everything, and that naturally he cannot err in the side he  looks at, since the perceptions of our senses are always true.      10    People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have  themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of  others.      11    All great amusements are dangerous to the Christian life; but among all  those which the world has invented there is none more to be feared than  the theatre. It is a representation of the passions so natural and so  delicate that it excites them and gives birth to them in our hearts,  and, above all, to that of love, principally when it is represented as  very chaste and virtuous. For the more innocent it appears to innocent  souls, the more they are likely to be touched by it. Its violence  pleases our self-love, which immediately forms a desire to produce the  same effects which are seen so well represented; and, at the same time,  we make ourselves a conscience founded on the propriety of the feelings  which we see there, by which the fear of pure souls is removed, since  they imagine that it cannot hurt their purity to love with a love which  seems to them so reasonable.    So we depart from the theatre with our heart so filled with all the  beauty and tenderness of love, the soul and the mind so persuaded of its  innocence, that we are quite ready to receive its first impressions, or  rather to seek an opportunity of awakening them in the heart of another,  in order that we may receive the same pleasures and the same sacrifices  which we have seen so well represented in the theatre.      12    Scaramouch,[5] who only thinks of one thing.    The doctor,[6] who speaks for a quarter of an hour after he has said  everything, so full is he of the desire of talking.      13    One likes to see the error, the passion of Cleobuline,[7] because she is  unconscious of it. She would be displeasing, if she were not deceived.      14    When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within  oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there before, although  one did not know it. Hence one is inclined to love him who makes us feel  it, for he has not shown us his own riches, but ours. And thus this  benefit renders him pleasing to us, besides that such community of  intellect as we have with him necessarily inclines the heart to love.      15    Eloquence, which persuades by sweetness, not by authority; as a tyrant,  not as a king.      16    Eloquence is an art of saying things in such a way--(1) that those to  whom we speak may listen to them without pain and with pleasure; (2)  that they feel themselves interested, so that self-love leads them more  willingly to reflection upon it.    It consists, then, in a correspondence which we seek to establish  between the head and the heart of those to whom we speak on the one  hand, and, on the other, between the thoughts and the expressions which  we employ. This assumes that we have studied well the heart of man so as  to know all its powers, and then to find the just proportions of the  discourse which we wish to adapt to them. We must put ourselves in the  place of those who are to hear us, and make trial on our own heart of  the turn which we give to our discourse in order to see whether one is  made for the other, and whether we can assure ourselves that the hearer  will be, as it were, forced to surrender. We ought to restrict  ourselves, so far as possible, to the simple and natural, and not to  magnify that which is little, or belittle that which is great. It is not  enough that a thing be beautiful; it must be suitable to the subject,  and there must be in it nothing of excess or defect.      17    Rivers are roads which move,[8] and which carry us whither we desire to  go.      18    When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is of advantage that there  should exist a common error which determines the mind of man, as, for  example, the moon, to which is attributed the change of seasons, the  progress of diseases, etc. For the chief malady of man is restless  curiosity about things which he cannot understand; and it is not so bad  for him to be in error as to be curious to no purpose.    The manner in which Epictetus, Montaigne, and Salomon de Tultie[9]  wrote, is the most usual, the most suggestive, the most remembered, and  the oftenest quoted; because it is entirely composed of thoughts born  from the common talk of life. As when we speak of the common error which  exists among men that the moon is the cause of everything, we never fail  to say that Salomon de Tultie says that when we do not know the truth  of a thing, it is of advantage that there should exist a common error,  etc.; which is the thought above.      19    The last thing one settles in writing a book is what one should put in  first.      20    _Order._--Why should I undertake to divide my virtues into four rather  than into six? Why should I rather establish virtue in four, in two, in  one? Why into _Abstine et sustine_[10] rather than into \"Follow  Nature,\"[11] or, \"Conduct your private affairs without injustice,\" as  Plato,[12] or anything else? But there, you will say, everything is  contained in one word. Yes, but it is useless without explanation, and  when we come to explain it, as soon as we unfold this maxim which  contains all the rest, they emerge in that first confusion which you  desired to avoid. So, when they are all included in one, they are hidden  and useless, as in a chest, and never appear save in their natural  confusion. Nature has established them all without including one in the  other.      21    Nature has made all her truths independent of one another. Our art makes  one dependent on the other. But this is not natural. Each keeps its own  place.      22    Let no one say that I have said nothing new; the arrangement of the  subject is new. When we play tennis, we both play with the same ball,  but one of us places it better.    I had as soon it said that I used words employed before. And in the same  way if the same thoughts in a different arrangement do not form a  different discourse, no more do the same words in their different  arrangement form different thoughts!      23    Words differently arranged have a different meaning, and meanings  differently arranged have different effects.      24    _Language._--We should not turn the mind from one thing to another,  except for relaxation, and that when it is necessary and the time  suitable, and not otherwise. For he that relaxes out of season wearies,  and he who wearies us out of season makes us languid, since we turn  quite away. So much does our perverse lust like to do the contrary of  what those wish to obtain from us without giving us pleasure, the coin  for which we will do whatever is wanted.      25    _Eloquence._--It requires the pleasant and the real; but the pleasant  must itself be drawn from the true.      26    Eloquence is a painting of thought; and thus those who, after having  painted it, add something more, make a picture instead of a portrait.      27    _Miscellaneous. Language._--Those who make antitheses by forcing words  are like those who make false windows for symmetry. Their rule is not to  speak accurately, but to make apt figures of speech.      28    Symmetry is what we see at a glance; based on the fact that there is no  reason for any difference, and based also on the face of man; whence it  happens that symmetry is only wanted in breadth, not in height or depth.      29    When we see a natural style, we are astonished and delighted; for we  expected to see an author, and we find a man. Whereas those who have  good taste, and who seeing a book expect to find a man, are quite  surprised to find an author. _Plus poetice quam humane locutus es._  Those honour Nature well, who teach that she can speak on everything,  even on theology.      30    We only consult the ear because the heart is wanting. The rule is  uprightness.    Beauty of omission, of judgment.      31    All the false beauties which we blame in Cicero have their admirers, and  in great number.      32    There is a certain standard of grace and beauty which consists in a  certain relation between our nature, such as it is, weak or strong, and  the thing which pleases us.    Whatever is formed according to this standard pleases us, be it house,  song, discourse, verse, prose, woman, birds, rivers, trees, rooms,  dress, etc. Whatever is not made according to this standard displeases  those who have good taste.    And as there is a perfect relation between a song and a house which are  made after a good model, because they are like this good model, though  each after its kind; even so there is a perfect relation between things  made after a bad model. Not that the bad model is unique, for there are  many; but each bad sonnet, for example, on whatever false model it is  formed, is just like a woman dressed after that model.    Nothing makes us understand better the ridiculousness of a false sonnet  than to consider nature and the standard, and then to imagine a woman or  a house made according to that standard.      33    _Poetical beauty._--As we speak of poetical beauty, so ought we to speak  of mathematical beauty and medical beauty. But we do not do so; and the  reason is that we know well what is the object of mathematics, and that  it consists in proofs, and what is the object of medicine, and that it  consists in healing. But we do not know in what grace consists, which is  the object of poetry. We do not know the natural model which we ought to  imitate; and through lack of this knowledge, we have coined fantastic  terms, \"The golden age,\" \"The wonder of our times,\" \"Fatal,\" etc., and  call this jargon poetical beauty.[13]    But whoever imagines a woman after this model, which consists in saying  little things in big words, will see a pretty girl adorned with mirrors  and"]]]
