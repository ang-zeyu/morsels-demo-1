Every one, therefore, whether great or little, was obliged to  regulate his liberality according to the estimation in which he held  himself, or to the opinion which others formed of him, and a personage  of such opulence as the King of Egypt was constrained by the laws of  common civility to display an almost boundless generosity: was he not  free to work the mines of the Divine Land or the diggings of the Upper  Nile; and as for gold, \"was it not as the dust of his country\"?**         * See the letter of Amenothes III. to Kallimmasin of       Babylon, where the King of Egypt complains of the inimical       designs which the Babylonian messengers had planned against       him, and of the intrigues they had connected on their return       to their own country; see also the letter from Burnaburiash       to Amenothes IV., in which he defends himself from the       accusation of having plotted against the King of Egypt at       any time, and recalls the circumstance that his father       Kurigalzu had refused to encourage the rebellion of one of       the Syrian tribes, subjects of Amenothes III.         ** See the letter of Dushratta, King of Mitanni, to the       Pharaoh Amenothes IV.    He would have desired nothing better than to exhibit such liberality,  had not the repeated calls on his purse at last constrained him to  parsimony; he would have been ruined, and Egypt with him, had he given  all that was expected of him. Except in a few extraordinary cases,  the gifts sent never realised the expectations of the recipients; for  instance, when twenty or thirty pounds of precious metal were looked  for, the amount despatched would be merely two or three. The indignation  of these disappointed beggars and their recriminations were then most  amusing: \"From the time when my father and thine entered into friendly  relations, they loaded each other with presents, and never waited to be  asked to exchange amenities;* and now my brother sends me two minas of  gold as a gift! Send me abundance of gold, as much as thy father sent,  and even, for so it must be, more than thy father.\"** Pretexts  were never wanting to give reasonable weight to such demands: one  correspondent had begun to build a temple or a palace in one of his  capitals,*** another was reserving his fairest daughter for the Pharaoh,  and he gave him to understand that anything he might receive would help  to complete the bride's trousseau.****         * Burnaburiash complains that the king's messengers had only       brought him on one occasion two minas of gold, on another       occasion twenty minas; moreover, that the quality of the       metal was so bad that hardly five minas of pure gold could       be extracted from it.         ** Literally, \"and they would never make each other a fair       request.\" The meaning I propose is doubtful, but it appears       to be required by the context. The letter from which this       passage was taken is from Burnaburiash, King of Babylon, to       Amenothes IV.         *** This is the pretext advanced by Burnaburiash in the       letter just cited.         **** This seems to have been the motive in a somewhat       embarrassing letter which Dushratta, King of Mitanni, wrote       to the Pharaoh Amenothes III. on the occasion of his fixing       the dowry of his daughter.    The princesses thus sent from Babylon or Mitanni to the court of Thebes  enjoyed on their arrival a more honourable welcome, and were assigned  a more exalted rank than those who came from Kharu and Phoenicia. As a  matter of fact, they were not hostages given over to the conqueror to be  disposed of at will, but queens who were united in legal marriage to an  ally.* Once admitted to the Pharaoh's court, they retained their full  rights as his wife, as well as their own fortune and mode of life. Some  would bring to their betrothed chests of jewels, utensils, and stuffs,  the enumeration of which would cover both sides of a large tablet;  others would arrive escorted by several hundred slaves or matrons as  personal attendants.** A few of them preserved their original name,***  many assumed an Egyptian designation,**** and so far adapted themselves  to the costumes, manners, and language of their adopted country, that  they dropped all intercourse with their native land, and became regular  Egyptians.         * The daughter of the King of the Khati, wife of Ramses IL,       was treated, as we see from the monuments, with as much       honour as would have been accorded to Egyptian princesses of       pure blood.         ** Gilukhipa, who was sent to Egypt to become the wife of       Amenothes III., took with her a company of three hundred and       seventy women for her service. She was a daughter of       Sutarna, King of Mitanni, and is mentioned several times in       the Tel el-Amarna correspondence.         *** For example, Gilukhipa, whose name is transcribed       Kilagipa in Egyptian, and another princess of Mitanni, niece       of Gilukhipa, called Tadu-khipa, daughter of Dushratta and       wife of Amenothes IV.         **** The prince of the Khati's daughter who married Ramses       II. is an example; we know her only by her Egyptian name       Maitnofiruri. The wife of Ramses III. added to the Egyptian       name of Isis her original name, Humazarati.    When, after several years, an ambassador arrived with greetings from  their father or brother, he would be puzzled by the changed appearance  of these ladies, and would almost doubt their identity: indeed, those  only who had been about them in childhood were in such cases able  to recognise them.* These princesses all adopted the gods of their  husbands,** though without necessarily renouncing their own. From time  to time their parents would send them, with much pomp, a statue of one  of their national divinities--Ishtar, for example--which, accompanied by  native priests, would remain for some months at the court.***         * This was the case with the daughter of Kallimmasin, King       of Babylon, married to Amenothes III.; her father's       ambassador did not recognise her.         ** The daughter of the King of the Khati, wife of Ramses       II., is represented in an attitude of worship before her       deified husband and two Egyptian gods.         *** Dushratta of Mitanni, sending a statue of Ishtar to his       daughter, wife of Amenothes III., reminds her that the same       statue had already made the voyage to Egypt in the time of       his father Sutarna.    The children of these queens ranked next in order to those whose mothers  belonged to the solar race, but nothing prevented them marrying their  brothers or sisters of pure descent, and being eventually raised to  the throne. The members of their families who remained in Asia were  naturally proud of these bonds of close affinity with the Pharaoh, and  they rarely missed an opportunity of reminding him in their letters that  they stood to him in the relationship of brother-in-law, or one of his  fathers-in-law; their vanity stood them in good stead, since it afforded  them another claim on the favours which they were perpetually asking of  him.*         * Dushratta of Mitanni never loses an opportunity of calling       Aoienothes III., husband of his sister Gilukhipa, and of one       of his daughters, \"akhiya,\" my brother, and \"khatani-ya,\" my       son-in-law.    These foreign wives had often to interfere in some of the contentions  which were bound to arise between two States whose subjects were in  constant intercourse with one another. Invasions or provincial wars may  have affected or even temporarily suspended the passage to and from of  caravans between the countries of the Tigris and those of the Nile; but  as soon as peace was re-established, even though it were the insecure  peace of those distant ages, the desert traffic was again resumed and  carried on with renewed vigour. The Egyptian traders who penetrated  into regions beyond the Euphrates, carried with them, and almost  unconsciously disseminated along the whole extent of their route, the  numberless products of Egyptian industry, hitherto but little known  outside their own country, and rendered expensive owing to the  difficulty of transmission or the greed of the merchants. The Syrians  now saw for the first time in great quantities, objects which had been  known to them hitherto merely through the few rare specimens which made  their way across the frontier: arms, stuffs, metal implements, household  utensils--in fine, all the objects which ministered to daily needs or to  luxury. These were now offered to them at reasonable prices, either  by the hawkers who accompanied the army or by the soldiers themselves,  always ready, as soldiers are, to part with their possessions in order  to procure a few extra pleasures in the intervals of fighting.

The scene       here reproduced occurs in most of the Theban tombs of the       XVIIII. dynasty.    On the other hand, whole convoys of spoil were despatched to Egypt  after every successful campaign, and their contents were distributed in  varying proportions among all classes of society, from the militiaman  belonging to some feudal contingent, who received, as a reward of his  valour, some half-dozen necklaces or bracelets, to the great lord of  ancient family or the Crown Prince, who carried off waggon-loads of  booty in their train. These distributions must have stimulated a passion  for all Syrian goods, and as the spoil was insufficient to satisfy the  increasing demands of the consumer, the waning commerce which had been  carried on from early times was once more revived and extended, till  every route, whether by land or water, between Thebes, Memphis, and the  Asiatic cities, was thronged by those engaged in its pursuit. It would  take "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#5)"],[1,"  II., and of Seti I.         ** The persons connected with the \"True Place\" were for a       long time considered as magistrates, and the \"True Place\" as       a tribunal.    It was their duty to keep up the monuments of the kings, and also of  private individuals, to clean the tombs, to visit the funerary chambers,  to note the condition of their occupants, and, if necessary, repair  the damage done by time, and to provide on certain days the offerings  prescribed by custom, or by clauses in the contract drawn up between  the family of the deceased and the religious authorities. The titles of  these officials indicated how humble was their position in relation to  the deified ancestors in whose service they were employed; they called  themselves the \"Servants of the True Place,\" and their chiefs the  \"Superiors of the Servants,\" but all the while they were people of  considerable importance, being rich, well educated, and respected in  their own quarter of the town.    [Illustration: 032.jpg PAINTINGS AT THE END OF THE HALL OF THE FIFTH  THE TOMB]    They professed to have a special devotion for Amenothes I. and his  mother, Nofritari, who, after five or six centuries of continuous  homage, had come to be considered as the patrons of Khafitnibus, but  this devotion was not to the depreciation of other sovereigns. It is  true that the officials were not always clear as to the identity of the  royal remains of which they had the care, and they were known to have  changed one of their queens or princesses into a king or some royal  prince.*         * Thus Queen Ahhotpu I., whom the \"servant\" Anhurkhau knew       to be a woman, is transformed into a King Ahhotpu in the       tomb of Khabokhnit.    [Illustration: AMENOTHES III. AT LUXOR]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Gayet.    They were surrounded by a whole host of lesser  functionaries--bricklayers, masons, labourers, exorcists, scribes (who  wrote out pious formulae for poor people, or copied the \"Books of the  going forth by day\" for the mummies), weavers, cabinet-makers, and  goldsmiths. The sculptors and the painters were grouped into guilds;*  many of them spent their days in the tombs they were decorating, while  others had their workshops above-ground, probably very like those of our  modern monumental masons.         * We gather this from the inscriptions which give us the       various titles of the sculptors, draughtsmen, or workmen,       but I have been unable to make out the respective positions       held by these different persons.    They kept at the disposal of their needy customers an assortment of  ready-made statues and stelae, votive tablets to Osiris, Anubis, and  other Theban gods and goddesses, singly or combined. The name of the  deceased and the enumeration of the members of his family were left  blank, and were inserted after purchase in the spaces reserved for the  purpose.*         * I succeeded in collecting at the Boulak Museum a       considerable number of these unfinished statues and stelae,       coming from the workshops of the necropolis.    These artisans made the greater part of their livelihood by means of  these epitaphs, and the majority thought only of selling as many of them  as they could; some few, however, devoted themselves to work of a higher  kind. Sculpture had reached a high degree of development under the  Thutmoses and the Ramses, and the art of depicting scenes in bas-relief  had been brought to a perfection hitherto unknown. This will be easily  seen by comparing the pictures in the old mastabas, such as those of Ti  or Phtahhotpu, with the finest parts of the temples of Qurneh, Abydos,  Karnak, Deir el-Bahari, or with the scenes in the tombs of Seti I. and  Ramses II., or those of private individuals such as Hui. The modelling  is firm and refined, showing a skill in the use of the chisel and an  elegance of outline which have never been surpassed: the Amenothes III.  of Luxor and the Khamhait of Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh might serve for models  in our own schools of the highest types which Egyptian art could produce  at its best in this particular branch. The drawing is freer than in  earlier examples, the action is more natural, the composition more  studied, and the perspective less wild. We feel that the artist handled  his subject _con amore_. He spared no trouble in sketching out  his designs and in making studies from nature, and, as papyrus was  expensive, he drew rough drafts, or made notes of his impressions on the  flat chips of limestone with which the workshops were strewn.    [Illustration: 035.jpg KHAMHAIT]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. de Mertens.    Nothing at that date could rival these sketches for boldness of  conception and freedom in execution, whether it were in the portrayal of  the majestic gait of a king or the agility of an acrobat. Of the latter  we have an example in the Turin Museum. The girl is nude, with the  exception of a tightly fitting belt about her hips, and she is throwing  herself backwards with so natural a motion, that we are almost tempted  to expect her to turn a somersault and fall once more into position with  her heels together.    [Illustration: 026.jpg SKETCH OF A FEMALE ACROBAT]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Petrie.    The unfinished figures on the tomb of Seti I. shows with what a steady  hand the clever draughtsman could sketch out his subjects. The head from  the nape of the neck round to the throat is described by a single line,  and the contour of the shoulders is marked by another. The form of the  body is traced by two undulating lines, while the arms and legs are  respectively outlined by two others. The articles of apparel and  ornaments, sketched rapidly at first, had to be gone over again by the  sculptor, who worked out the smallest details. One might almost count  the tresses of the hair, while the folds of the dress and the enamels of  the girdle and bracelets are minutely chiselled.    [Illustration: BAS-RELIEF OF SETI I., SHOWING CORRECTIONS MADE BY THE  SCULPTOR]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from photographs by Insinger and       Daniel Heron.    When the draughtsman had finished his picture from the sketch which he  had made, or when he had enlarged it from a smaller drawing, the master  of the studio would go over it again, marking here and there in red the  defective points, to which the sculptor gave his attention when working  the subject out on the wall. If he happened to make a mistake in  executing it, he corrected it as well as he was able by filling up with  stucco or hard cement the portions to be remodelled, and by starting to  work again upon the fresh surface. This cement has fallen out in some  cases, and reveals to our eyes to-day the marks of the underlying  chiselling. There are, for example, two profiles of Seti I. on one of  the bas-reliefs of the hypostyle hall at Karnak, one faintly outlined,  and the other standing fully out from the surface of the stone. The  sense of the picturesque was making itself felt, and artists were  no longer to be excused for neglecting architectural details, the  configuration of the country, the drawing of rare plants, and, in fact,  all those accessories which had been previously omitted altogether or  merely indicated. The necessity of covering such vast surfaces as the  pylons offered had accustomed them to arrange the various scenes of one  and the same action in a more natural and intimate connexion than their  predecessors could possibly have done. In these scenes the Pharaoh  naturally played the chief part, but in place of choosing for treatment  merely one or other important action of the monarch calculated  to exhibit his courage, the artist endeavoured to portray all the  successive incidents in his campaigns, in the same manner as the early  Italian painters were accustomed to depict, one after the other, and on  the same canvas, all the events of the same legend. The details of these  gigantic compositions may sometimes appear childish to us, and we may  frequently be at a loss in determining the relations of the parts, yet  the whole is full of movement, and, although mutilated, gives us even  yet the impression which would have been made upon us by the turmoil of  a battle in those distant days.    The sculptor of statues for a long time past was not a whit less skilful  than the artist who executed bas-reliefs. The sculptor was doubtless  often obliged to give enormous proportions to the figure of the king, to  prevent his being overshadowed by the mass of buildings among which the  statue was to appear; but this necessity of exaggerating the human form  did not destroy in the artist that sense of proportion and that skilful  handling of the chisel which are so strikingly displayed in the sitting  scribe or in the princess at Meidum; it merely trained him to mark out  deftly the principal lines, and to calculate the volume and dimensions  of these gigantic granite figures of some fifty to sixty-five feet high,  with as great confidence and skill as he would have employed upon any  statue of ordinary dimensions which might be entrusted to him.  The colossal statues at Abu-Simbel and Thebes still witness to the  incomparable skill of the Theban sculptors in the difficult art of  imagining and executing superhuman types. The decadence of Egyptian art  did not begin until the time of Ramses III., but its downward progress  was rapid, and the statues of the Ramesside period are of little or no  artistic value. The form of these figures is poor, the technique crude,  and the expression of the faces mean and commonplace. They betray the  hand of a mechanical workman who, while still in the possession of the  instruments of his trade, can infuse no new life into the traditions of  the schools, nor break away from them altogether.
