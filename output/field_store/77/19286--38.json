Thus the suzerainty of Great Britain,  which under the reign of Her late Majesty Victoria, of blessed memory,  was the Natives' only bulwark, has now apparently been withdrawn or relaxed,  and the Republicans, like a lot of bloodhounds long held in the leash,  use the free hand given by the Imperial Government not only to guard against  a possible supersession of Cape ideals of toleration, but to effectively  extend throughout the Union the drastic native policy pursued by the Province  which is misnamed \"Free\" State, and enforce it with the utmost rigour.    During the first year of the Union, it would seem that General Botha  made an honest attempt to live up to his London promises,  that are mentioned by Mr. Merriman in his speech (reproduced elsewhere)  on the second reading of the Bill in Parliament.  It would seem  that General Botha endeavoured to allay British apprehensions and concern  for the welfare of the Native population.  In pursuance of this policy  General Botha won the approbation of all Natives by appointing Hon. H. Burton,  a Cape Minister, to the portfolio of Native Affairs.  That the appointment  was a happy one, from the native point of view, became manifest  when Mr. Burton signalized the ushering in of Union, by releasing  Chief Dinizulu-ka-Cetywayo, who at that time was undergoing  a sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Natal Supreme Court,  and by the restoration to Dinizulu of his pension of 500 Pounds a year.  Also, in deference to the wishes of the Native Congress,  Mr. Burton abrogated two particularly obnoxious Natal measures,  one legalizing the \"Sibalo\" system of forced labour, the other prohibiting  public meetings by Natives without the consent of the Government.  These abrogations placed the Natives of Natal in almost the same position  as the Cape Natives though without giving them the franchise.  So, too, when a drastic Squatters' Bill was gazetted early in 1912,  and the recently formed Native National Congress sent a deputation  to interview Mr. Burton in Capetown; after hearing the deputation,  he graciously consented to withdraw the proposed measure,  pending the allotment of new Locations in which Natives evicted  by such a measure could find an asylum.  In further deference  to the representations of the Native Congress, in which they were supported  by Senators the Hon. W. P. Schreiner, Colonel Stanford, and Mr. Krogh,  the Union Government gazetted another Bill in January, 1911,  to amend an anomaly which, at that time, was peculiar to the \"Free\" State:  an anomaly under which a Native can neither purchase nor lease land,  and native landowners in the \"Free\" State could only sell their land  to the white people.    The gazetted Bill proposed to legalize only in one district  of the Orange \"Free\" State the sale of landed property by a Native  to another Native as well as to a white man, but it did not propose  to enable Natives to buy land from white men.  The object of the Bill  was to remove a hardship, mentioned elsewhere in this sketch,  by which a \"Free\" State Native was by law debarred from inheriting  landed property left to him under his uncle's will.  But against  such small attempts at reform, proposed or carried out by the Union Government  in the interest of the Natives, granted in small instalments of a teaspoonful  at a time -- reforms dictated solely by feelings of justice and equity --  ex-Republicans were furious.    From platform, Press, and pulpit it was suggested that  General Botha's administration was too pro-English and needed overhauling.  The Dutch peasants along the countryside were inflamed by hearing  that their gallant leader desired to Anglicize the country.  Nothing was more repellent to the ideas of the backveld Dutch,  and so at small meetings in the country districts resolutions were passed  stating that the Botha administration had outlived its usefulness.  These resolutions reaching the Press from day to day  had the effect of stirring up the Dutch voters against the Ministry,  and particularly against the head.  At this time General Botha's sound policy  began to weaken.  He transferred Hon. H. Burton, first Minister of Natives,  to the portfolio of Railways and Harbours, and appointed General Hertzog,  of all people in the world, to the portfolio of Native Affairs.    The good-humoured indulgence of some Dutch and English farmers towards  their native squatters, and the affectionate loyalty of some of these  native squatters in return, will cause a keen observer, arriving at  a South African farm, to be lost in admiration for this mutual good feeling.  He will wonder as to the meaning of the fabled bugbear anent the alleged  struggle between white and black, which in reality appears to exist  only in the fertile brain of the politician.  Thus let the new arrival go  to one of the farms in the Bethlehem or Harrismith Districts for example,  and see how willingly the Native toils in the fields; see him  gathering in his crops and handing over the white farmer's share of the crop  to the owner of the land; watch the farmer receiving his tribute  from the native tenants, and see him deliver the first prize  to the native tenant who raised the largest crop during that season;  let him also see both the Natives and the landowning white farmers  following to perfection the give-and-take policy of \"live and let live\",  and he will conclude that it would be gross sacrilege to attempt to disturb  such harmonious relations between these people of different races and colours.  But with a ruthless hand the Natives' Land Act has succeeded  in remorselessly destroying those happy relations.    First of all, General Hertzog, the new Minister of Native Affairs,  travelled up and down the country lecturing farmers on their folly  in letting ground to the Natives; the racial extremists of his party  hailed him as the right man for the post, for, as his conduct showed them,  he would soon \"fix up\" the Natives.  At one or two places  he was actually welcomed as the future Prime Minister of the Union.  On the other hand, General Botha, who at that time seemed  to have become visibly timid, endeavoured to ingratiate himself  with his discontented supporters by joining his lieutenant  in travelling to and fro, denouncing the Dutch farmers for not  expelling the Natives from their farms and replacing them with poor whites.  This became a regular Ministerial campaign against the Natives,  so that it seemed clear that if any Native could still find a place  in the land, it was not due to the action of the Government.  In his campaign the Premier said other unhappy things which were  diametrically opposed to his London speeches of two years before;  and while the Dutch colonists railed at him for trying to Anglicize  the country, English speakers and writers justly accused him of speaking  with two voices; cartoonists, too, caricatured him as having two heads --  one, they said, for London, and the second one for South Africa.    The uncertain tenure by which Englishmen in the public service  held their posts became the subject of debates in the Union Parliament,  and the employment of Government servants of colour was decidedly precarious.  They were swept out of the Railway and Postal Service  with a strong racial broom, in order to make room for poor whites,  mainly of Dutch descent.  Concession after concession  was wrung from the Government by fanatical Dutch postulants for office,  for Government doles and other favours, who, like the daughters of  the horse-leech in the Proverbs of Solomon, continually cried, \"Give, give.\"  By these events we had clearly turned the corner and were pacing backwards  to pre-Union days, going back, back, and still further backward,  to the conditions which prevailed in the old Republics,  and (if a check is not applied) we shall steadily drift back  to the days of the old Dutch East Indian administration.    The Bill which proposed to ameliorate the \"Free\" State cruelty,  to which reference has been made above, was dropped like a hot potato.  Ministers made some wild and undignified speeches, of which  the following spicy extract, from a speech by the Rt. Hon. Abraham Fischer  to his constituents at Bethlehem, is a typical sample --    \"What is it you want?\" he asked.  \"We have passed all the coolie* laws  and we have passed all the Kafir laws.  The `Free' State  has been safeguarded and all her colour laws have been adopted by Parliament.  What more can the Government do for you?\"  And so the Union ship  in this reactionary sea sailed on and on and on, until she struck an iceberg  -- the sudden dismissal of General Hertzog.    --  * A contemptuous South African term for British Indians.  --    To the bitter sorrow of his admirers, General Hertzog,  who is the fearless exponent of Dutch ideals, was relieved of  his portfolios of Justice and Native Affairs -- it was whispered  as a result of a suggestion from London; and then the Dutch extremists,  in consequence of their favourite's dismissal, gave vent to their anger  in the most disagreeable manner.  One could infer from their platform speeches  that, from their point of view, scarcely any one else had any rights  in South Africa, and least of all the man with a black skin.    In the face of this, the Government's timidity was almost unendurable.  They played up to the desires of the racial extremists, with the result that  a deadlock overtook the administration.  Violent laws like the Immigration Law  (against British Indians and alien Asiatics) and the Natives' Land  were indecently hurried through Parliament to allay  the susceptibilities of \"Free\" State Republicans.

Our conversation halted, and both of us felt the  embarrassment of the moment.  I broke the silence and spoke out my  thoughts: \"Men become accustomed to live from youth up as it were in a  cage, and when they are once in the open air they dare not venture to  use their wings, fearing, if they fly, that they may stumble against  everything.\"    \"Yes,\" replied she, \"and that is very proper and cannot well be  otherwise.  One often wishes that he could live like the birds which  fly in the woods, and meet upon the branches and sing together without  being presented to each other.  But, my friend, even among the birds  there are owls and sparrows, and in life it is well that one can pass  them without knowing them.  It is sometimes with life as with poetry.  As the real poet can express the Truest and most Beautiful, although  fettered by metrical form, so man should know how to preserve freedom  of thought and feeling notwithstanding the restraints of society.\"    I could not help recalling the words of Platen: \"That which proves  itself everlasting under all circumstances, told in the fetters of  words, is the unfettered spirit.\"    \"Yes,\" said she, with a cordial but sweetly playful smile; \"but I have  a privilege which is at the same time my burden and loneliness.  I  often pity the young men and maidens, for they cannot have a friendship  or an intimacy without their relatives or themselves pronouncing it  love, or what they call love.  They lose much on this account.  The  maiden knows not what slumbers in her soul, and what might be awakened  by earnest conversation with a noble friend; and the young man in turn  would acquire so much knightly virtue if women were suffered to be the  distant witnesses of the inner struggles of the spirit.  It will not  do, however, for immediately love comes in play, or what they call  love--the quick beating of the heart--the stormy billows of hope--the  delight over a beautiful face--the sweet sentimentality--sometimes also  prudent calculation--in short, all that troubles the calm sea, which is  the true picture of pure human love------\"    She checked herself suddenly, and an expression of pain passed over her  countenance.  \"I dare not talk more to-day,\" said she; \"my physician  will not allow it.  I would like to hear one of Mendelssohn's  songs--that duet, which my young friend used to play years ago.  Is it  not so?\"    I could not answer, for as she ceased speaking and gently folded her  hands, I saw upon her hand a ring.  She wore it on her little  finger--the ring which she had given me and I had given her.  Thoughts  came too fast for utterance, and I seated myself at the piano and  played.  When I had done, I turned around and said: \"Would one could  only speak thus in tones without words!\"    \"That is possible,\" said she; \"I understood it all.  But I must not do  anything more to-day, for every day I grow weaker.  We must be better  acquainted, and a poor sick recluse may certainly claim forbearance.  We meet to-morrow evening, at the same hour; shall we not?\"    I seized her hand and was about to kiss it, but she held my hand  firmly, pressed it and said: \"It is better thus.  Good bye.\"          FIFTH MEMORY.    It would be difficult to describe my thoughts and emotions as I went  home.  The soul cannot at once translate itself perfectly in words, and  there are \"thoughts without words,\" which in every man are the prelude  of supreme joy and suffering.  It was neither joy nor pain, only an  indescribable bewilderment which I felt; thoughts flew through my  innermost being like meteors, which shoot from heaven towards earth but  are extinguished before they reach the goal.  As we sometimes say in a  dream, \"I am dreaming,\" so I said to myself \"thou livest\"--\"it is she.\"  I tried again to reflect and calm myself, and said, \"She is a lovely  vision--a very wonderful spirit.\"  At another time, I pictured the  delightful evenings I should pass during the holidays.  But no, no,  this cannot be.  She is everything I sought, thought, hoped and  believed.  Here was at last a human soul, as clear and fresh as a  spring morning.  I had seen at the first glance what she was and how  she felt, and we had greeted and recognized one another.  And my good  angel in me, she answered me no more.  She was gone and I felt there  was no place on earth where I should find her again.    Now began a beautiful life, for I was with her every evening.  We soon  realized that we were in truth old acquaintances and that we could only  call each other Thou.  It seemed also as if we had lived near and with  one another always, for she manifested not an emotion that did not find  its counterpart in my soul, and there was no, thought which I uttered  to which she did not nod friendly assent, as much as to say: \"I thought  so too.\"  I had previously heard the greatest master of our time and  his sister extemporize on the piano, and scarcely comprehended how two  persons could understand and feel themselves so perfectly and yet  never, not even in a single note, disturb the harmony of their playing.  Now it became intelligible to me.  Yes, now I understood for the first  time that my soul was not so poor and empty as it had seemed to me, and  that it had been only the sun that was lacking to open all its germs,  and buds to the light.  And yet what a sad and brief spring-time it was  that our souls experienced!  We forget in May that roses so soon  wither, but here every evening reminded us that one leaf after another  was falling to the ground.  She felt it before I did, and alluded to it  apparently without pain, and our interviews grew more earnest and  solemn daily.    One evening, as I was about to leave, she said: \"I did not think I  should grow so old.  When I gave you the ring on my confirmation day I  thought I should have to take my departure from you all, very soon.  And yet I have lived so many years, and enjoyed so much beauty--and  suffered so very much!  But one forgets that!  Now, while I feel that  my departure is near, every hour, every minute, grows precious to me.  Good night!  Do not come too late to-morrow.\"    One day as I went into her room, I met an Italian painter with her.  She spoke Italian with him, and although he was evidently more artisan  than artist, she addressed him with such amiability and modesty, with  such respect even, one could not avoid recognizing that nobility of  soul which is the true nobility of birth.  When the painter had taken  his leave, she said to me: \"I wish to show you a picture which will  please you.  The original is in the gallery at Paris.  I read a  description of it, and have had it copied by the Italian.\"  She showed  me the painting, and waited my opinion.  It was a picture of a man of  middle age, in the old German costume.  The expression was dreamy and  resigned, and so characteristic that no one could doubt this man once  lived.  The whole tone of the picture in the foreground was dark and  brownish; but in the background was a landscape, and on the horizon the  first gleams of daybreak appeared.  I could discover nothing special in  the picture, and yet it produced a feeling of such satisfaction that  one might have tarried to look at it for hours at a time.  \"There is  nothing like a genuine human face,\" said I; \"Raphael himself could not  have imagined a face like this.\"    \"No,\" said she.  \"But now I will tell you why I wished to have the  picture.  I read that no one knew the artist, nor whom the picture  represents.  But it is very clearly a philosopher of the Middle Ages.  Just such a picture I wanted for my gallery, for you are aware that no  one knows the author of the 'German Theology,' and moreover, that we  have no picture of him.  I wished to try whether the picture of an  Unknown by an Unknown would answer for our German theologian, and if  you have no objections we will hang it here between the 'Albigenses'  and the 'Diet of Worms,' and call it the 'German Theologian.'\"    \"Good,\" said I; \"but it is somewhat too vigorous and manly for the  Frankforter.\"    \"That may be,\" replied she.  \"But for a suffering and dying life like  mine, much consolation and strength may be derived from his book.  I  thank him much, for it disclosed to me for the first time the true  secret of Christian doctrine in all its simplicity.  I felt that I was  free to believe or disbelieve the old teacher, whoever he may have  been, for his doctrines had no external constraint upon me; at last it  seized upon me with such power that it seemed to me I knew for the  first time what revelation was.  It is precisely this fact that bars so  many out from true Christianity, namely: that its doctrines confront us  as revelation before revelation takes place in ourselves.  This has  often given me much anxiety; not that I had ever doubted the truth and  divinity of our religion, but I felt I had no right to a belief which  others had given me, and that what I, had learned and received when a  child, without comprehending, did not belong to me.  One can believe  for us as little as one can live and die for us.\"    \"Certainly,\" said I; \"therein lies the cause of many hot and bitter  struggles; that the teachings of Christ, instead of winning our hearts  gradually and irresistibly, as they won the hearts of the apostles and  early Christians, confront us from the earliest childhood as the  infallible law of a mighty church, and demand of us an unconditional  submission, which they call faith.  Doubts arise sooner or later in the  breast of every one who has the power of thinking and reverence for the  truth; and then even when we are on the right road, to overcome our  faith, the terrors of doubt and unbelief arise and disturb the tranquil  development of the new life.\"    \"I read recently in an English work,\" she interrupted, \"that truth  makes revelation, and not revelation truth.  This perfectly expressed  what I"]]]
