The fact that you were not a regular boatman would make  the matter all the worse, and the maxim that 'dead men tell no tales'  is largely acted upon in Venice.    \"I think, sir, the best plan will be to row straight back, and leave  our fare to find his way home as best he may.\"    \"I mean to find something out about it if I can, Giuseppi. A state  secret may be dangerous, but it may be valuable. Anyhow, there can be  no great risk in it. On the water I think we can show our heels to  anyone who chases us; and once in Venice, we are absolutely safe, for  no one would suspect a gondola of Mr. Hammond, the English merchant, of  having any connection with a hired craft with its two gondoliers.\"    \"That is true enough, sir; but I don't like it for all that. However,  if you have made up your mind to it, there is nothing more to be said.\"    \"Very well. You stay here, and I will go and look round. You had better  get the gondola afloat, and be ready to start at the instant, so that,  if I should have to run for it, I can jump on board and be off in a  moment.\"    Francis made his way quietly up to the little group of huts inhabited  by the fishermen, but in none of them could he see any signs of  life--no lights were visible, nor could he hear the murmur of voices.  There were, he knew, other buildings scattered about on the island; but  he had only the light of the stars to guide him, and, not knowing  anything of the exact position of the houses, he thought it better to  return to the boat.    \"I can find no signs of them, Giuseppi.\"    \"All the better, Messer Francisco. There are some sorts of game, which  it is well for the safety of the hunter not to discover. I was very  glad, I can tell you, when I heard your whistle, and made out your  figure returning at a walk. Now you are back I will take an hour's nap,  and I should advise you to do the same.\"    But Francis had no thought of sleep, and sat down at his end of the  gondola, wondering over the adventure, and considering whether or not  it would be worth while to follow it up another night. That it was a  plot of some sort he had little doubt. There were always in Venice two  parties, equally anxious perhaps for the prosperity of the republic,  but differing widely as to the means by which that prosperity would be  best achieved, and as to the alliances which would, in the long run,  prove most beneficial to her. There were also needy and desperate men  ready enough to take bribes from any who might offer them, and to  intrigue in the interest of Padua or Ferrara, Verona, Milan, or  Genoa--whichever might for the time be their paymasters.    Francis was English, but he had been long enough in Venice to feel a  pride in the island city, and to be almost as keenly interested in her  fortunes as were his companions and friends; and a certain sense of  duty, mingled with his natural love of adventure, decided him to follow  up the chance which had befallen him, and to endeavour to ascertain the  nature of the plot which was, he had little doubt, being hatched at San  Nicolo.    In a very few minutes the regular breathing of Giuseppi, who had curled  himself up in the bottom of the boat, showed that he had gone to sleep;  and he did not stir until, an hour and a half after the return of  Francis, the latter heard the fall of footsteps approaching the  gondola.    \"Wake up, Giuseppi, here comes our fare!\"    Francis stood up and stretched himself as the stranger came alongside,  as if he too had been fast asleep.    \"Take me back to the spot where I hailed you,\" the fare said briefly,  as he stepped into the boat and threw himself back on the cushions, and  without a word the lads dipped their oars in the water and the gondola  glided away towards Venice.    Just as they reached the mouth of the Grand Canal, and were about to  turn into it, a six-oared gondola shot out from under the point, and a  voice called out:    \"Stop, in the name of the republic, and give an account of yourselves!\"    \"Row on,\" the passenger exclaimed, starting up. \"Ten ducats if you can  set me safely on shore.\"    Had the lads been real gondoliers, it is probable that even this  tempting offer would not have induced them to disregard the order from  the galley, for they would have run no slight risk in so doing. But  Francis had no desire to be caught, and perhaps imprisoned for a  considerable time, until he was able to convince the council that his  share of the night's work had been merely the result of a boyish freak.  With two strokes of his oar, therefore, he swept the boat's head round,  thereby throwing their pursuers directly astern of them; then he and  Giuseppi threw their whole weight into the stroke, and the boat danced  over the water at a pace very different to that at which it had  hitherto proceeded.    But, fast as they went, the galley travelled somewhat faster, the  rowers doing their utmost in obedience to the angry orders of their  officer; and had the race been continued on a broad stretch of water,  it would sooner or later have overhauled the gondola. But Francis was  perfectly aware of this, and edged the boat away towards the end of the  Piazzetta, and then, shooting her head round, dashed at full speed  along the canal by the side of the ducal palace, the galley being at  the time some forty yards behind.    \"The first to the right,\" Francis said, and with scarce a pause in  their speed, they turned off at right angles up the first canal they  came to. Again and again they turned and twisted, regardless of the  direction in which the canals took them, their only object being to  gain on their pursuers, who lost considerably at each turn, being  obliged always to check their speed, before arriving at each angle, to  allow the boat to go round.    In ten minutes she was far behind, and they then abated their speed,  and turned the boat's head in the direction in which they wished to go.    \"By San Paolo,\" the stranger said, \"that was well done! You are masters  of your craft, and sent your boat along at a pace which must have  astonished those fellows in that lumbering galley. I had no reason to  fear them, but I do not care to be interfered with and questioned by  these jacks-in-office of the republic.\"    A few minutes later they reached the place where he embarked, and as he  got out he handed the money he had promised to Giuseppi.    \"Next Thursday night,\" he said, \"at half past ten.\"    \"It seems a dangerous sort of service, signor,\" Giuseppi said  hesitatingly. \"It is no joke to disobey the officers of the republic,  and next time we may not be so fortunate.\"    \"It's worth taking a little risk when you are well paid,\" the other  said, turning away, \"and it is not likely we shall run against one of  the state galleys another night.\"    \"Home, now, Giuseppi,\" Francis said, \"we can talk about it tomorrow.  It's the best night's work you ever did in your life, and as I have had  a grand excitement we are both contented.\"    During the next few days Francis debated seriously with himself whether  to follow up the adventure; but he finally decided on doing so, feeling  convinced that there could be no real danger, even were the boat seized  by one of the state galleys; as his story, that he had gone into the  matter simply to discover whether any plot was intended against the  republic, would finally be believed, as it would be beyond the bounds  of probability that a lad of his age could himself have been concerned  in such a conspiracy. As to Giuseppi, he offered no remonstrance when  Francis told him that he intended to go out to San Nicolo on the  following Thursday, for the ten ducats he had received were a sum  larger than he could have saved in a couple of years' steady work, and  were indeed quite a fortune in his eyes. Another such a sum, and he  would be able, when the time came, to buy a gondola of his own, to  marry, and set up housekeeping in grand style. As for the danger, if  Francis was willing to run it he could do the same; for after all, a  few months' imprisonment was the worst that could befall him for his  share in the business.    Before the day came Matteo Giustiniani told Francis a piece of news  which interested him.    \"You remember my cousin Maria Polani, whom we met the other evening on  the Grand Canal?\"    \"Of course I do, Matteo. What of her?\"    \"Well, what do you think? Ruggiero Mocenigo, whom I pointed out to you  on the Piazza--the man who had been banished for two years--has asked  for her hand in marriage.\"    \"He is not going to have it, I hope,\" Francis said indignantly. \"It  would be a shame, indeed, to give her to such a man as that.\"    \"That is just what her father thought, Francisco, and he refused  Ruggiero pretty curtly, and told him, I believe, he would rather see  her in her grave than married to him; and I hear there was a regular  scene, and Ruggiero went away swearing Polani should regret his  refusal.\"    \"I suppose your cousin does not care much about his threats,\" Francis  said.    \"I don't suppose he cares much about them,\" Matteo replied; \"but  Ruggiero is very powerfully connected, and may do him damage, not to  speak of the chance of his hiring a bravo to stab him on the first  opportunity. I know my father advised Polani to be very cautious where  he went at night for a time. This fellow, Ruggiero, is a dangerous  enemy. If he were to get Polani stabbed, it would be next to impossible  to prove that it was his doing, however strong the suspicion might be;  for mere suspicion goes for nothing against a man with his influence  and connections. He has two near relations on the council, and if he  were to burn down Polani's mansion, and to carry off Maria, the chances  are against his being punished, if he did but keep out of the way for a  few months.\"    As in England powerful barons were in the habit of waging private wars  with each other, and the carrying off a bride by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],[0,"The Way of the Wild (#5)"],[1," that had been hunting him.    And almost at the same moment, five miles away, his wife had just  succeeded in swimming a swift and ice-choked river.  She was standing  on the bank, watching another dot emerge into the lone landscape, and  that dot was the other one of the Brothers.    They had failed to avenge the reindeer, and the wolverines were safe.  Safe?  Bah!  Wild creatures are never safe.  Nature knows better than  that, since by safety comes degeneration.    There was a warning--an instant's rustling hissing in the air  above--less than an instant's.  But that was all, and for the first  time in his life--perhaps because he was tired, fagged--Gulo failed to  take it.  And you must never fail to take a warning if you are a wild  creature, you know!  There are no excuses in Nature.    Retribution was swift.  Gulo yelled aloud--and he was a dumb beast,  too, as a rule, but I guess the pain was excruciating--as a hooked  stiletto, it appeared, stabbed through fur, through skin, deep down  through flesh, right into his back, clutching, gripping vise-like.  Another stiletto, hooked, too, worse than the first one, beat at his  skull, tore at his scalp, madly tried to rip out his eyes.  Vast  overshadowing pinions--as if they were the wings of Azrael--hammered in  his face, smothering him, beating him down.    Ah, but I have seen some fights, yet never such a fight as that; and  never again do I want to see such a fight as the one between Gulo and  the golden eagle that made a mistake in his pride of power.    All the awful, cruel, diabolical, clever, devilish, and yet almost  human fury that was in that old brute of a Gulo flamed out in him at  that moment, and he fought as they fight who go down to hell.  It was  frightful.  It was terrifying.  Heaven alone knows what the eagle  thought he had got his claws into.  It was like taking hold of a flash  of forked lightning by the point.  It was--great!    Still, flight _is_ flight, and lifting-power is lifting-power.  Gulo,  even Gulo, could not get over that.  He could not stop those vast vans  from flapping; and as they flapped they rose, the eagle rose,  he--though it was like the skinning of his back alive--rose too,  wriggling ignominiously, raging, foaming, snapping, kicking, but--he  rose.    Slowly, very slowly, the great bird lifted his terrible prey up and  up--ten, twenty, thirty, forty feet, but no higher.  That was the limit  of his lift, the utmost of his strength; and at that height parallel  with the ridge, he began to carry the wolverine along, the wolverine  that was going mad with rage in his grasp.    It was a mistake, of course--a mistake for the wolverine to be out on  the open ridge in stark daylight; another mistake for the eagle,  presuming on his fine, lustful pride of strength, to attack him.    And then suddenly Gulo got his chance.  It hit him bang in the face,  nearly blinding him as it passed--the tree-top.  Like lightning Gulo's  jaws clashed shut upon it, his claws gripped, and--he thought his back  was going to come off whole.  But he stuck it.  He was not called Gulo  the Indomitable for nothing.  And the eagle stopped too.  He had to,  for he would not let go; nor would Gulo.    An awful struggle followed, in the middle of which the pine-top broke,  gave way, and, before either seemed to know quite what was happening,  down they both came, crashing from branch to branch, to earth.    The fall broke the king of the birds' hold, but not the fighting fury  of the most hated of all the beasts.  He rose up, half-blind, almost  senseless, but mad with rage beyond any conception of fury, did old  Gulo, and he hurled himself upon that eagle.    What happened then no man can say.  There was just one furious mix-up  of whirling, powdered snow, that hung in the air like a mist, out of  which a great pinion, a clawing paw, a snapping beak, a flash of fangs,  a skinny leg and clutching, talons, a circling bushy tail appeared and  vanished in flashes, to the accompaniment of stupendous flappings and  abominably wicked growls.          *      *      *      *      *      *    That night the lone wolf, scouting along the ridge-top, stopped to  sniff intelligently at the scattered, torn eagle's feathers lying about  in the trampled snow, at the blood, at the one skinny, mailed, mightily  taloned claw still clutching brown-black, rusty fur and red skin; at  the unmistakable flat-footed trail of Gulo, the wolverine, leading away  to the frowning, threatening blackness of the woods.  He could  understand it all, that wolf.  Indeed, it was written there quite  plainly for such as could read.  He read, and he passed on.  He did not  follow Gulo's bloody trail.  No--oh, dear, no!  Probably, quite  probably, he had met Gulo the Indomitable before, and--was not that  enough?          II    BLACKIE AND CO.    Blackie flung himself into the fight like a fiery fiend cut from coal.  He did not know what the riot was about--and cared less.  He only knew  that the neutrality of his kingdom was broken.  Some one was fighting  over his borders; and when fighting once begins, you never know where  it may end!  (This is an axiom.)  Therefore he set himself to stop it  at once, lest worse should befall.    He found two thrushes apparently in the worst stage of d.t.'s.  One was  on his back; the other was on the other's chest.  Both were in a  laurel-bush, half-way up, and apparently they kept there, and did not  fall, through a special dispensation of Providence.  Both fought like  ten devils, _and both sang_.  That was the stupefying part, the song.  It was choked, one owns; it was inarticulate, half-strangled with rage,  but still it _was_ song.    A cock-chaffinch and a hen-chaffinch were perched on two twigs higher  up, and were peering down at the grappling maniacs.  Also two blue  titmice had just arrived to see what was up, and a sparrow and one  great tit were hurrying to the spot--all on Blackie's \"beat,\" on  Blackie's very own hunting-ground.  Apparently a trouble of that kind  concerned everybody, or everybody thought it did.    Blackie arrived upon the back of the upper and, presumably, winning  thrush with a bang that removed that worthy to the ground quite  quickly, and in a heap.  The second thrush fetched up on a lower  branch, and by the time the first had ceased to see stars he had  apparently regained his sanity.  He beheld Blackie above him, and fled.  Perhaps he had met Blackie, professionally, before, I don't know.  He  fled, anyway, and Blackie helped him to flee faster than he bargained  for.    By the time Blackie had got back, the first thrush was sitting on a  branch in a dazed and silly condition, like a fowl that has been waked  up in the night.  Blackie presented him with a dig gratis from his  orange dagger, and he nearly fell in fluttering to another branch.  And  Blackie flew away, chuckling.  He knew that, so far as that thrush was  concerned, there would be no desire to see any more fighting for some  time.    But, all the same, Blackie was not pleased.  He was worked off his feet  providing rations for three ugly youngsters in a magnificently designed  and exquisitely worked and interwoven edifice, interlined with rigid  cement of mud, which we, in an off-hand manner, simply dismiss as \"A  nest.\"  The young were his children; they might have been  white-feathered angels with golden wings, by the value he put on them.  The thrush episode was only a portent, and not the first.  He had no  trouble with the other feathered people he tolerated on his beat.    Blackie went straight to the lawn.  (Jet and orange against deep green  was the picture.)    Now, if you and I had searched that dry lawn with magnifying-glasses,  in the heat of the sun, there and then, we should not have found a  single worm, not the hint or the ghost of one; yet that bird took three  long, low hops, made some quick motion with his beak--I swear it never  seemed to touch the ground, even, let alone dig---executed a kind of  jump in the air--some say he used his legs in the air--and there he was  with a great, big, writhing horror of a worm as big as a snake (some  snakes).    Thrushes bang their worms about to make them see sense and give in;  they do it many times.  Blackie banged his giant only a little once or  twice, and then not savagely, like a thrush.  Also, again, he may or  may not have used his feet.  Moreover, he gave up two intervals to  surveying the world against any likely or unlikely stalking death.  Yet  that worm shut up meekly in most unworm-like fashion, and Blackie cut  it up into pieces.  The whole operation took nicely under sixty seconds.    Blackie gave no immediate explanation why he had reduced his worm to  sections.  It did not seem usual.  Instead, he eyed the hedge, eyed the  sky, eyed the surroundings.  Nothing seemed immediately threatening,  and he hopped straight away about three yards, where instantly, he  conjured another and a smaller worm out of nowhere.  With this  unfortunate horror he hopped back to the unnice scene of the first  worm's decease, and carved that second worm up in like manner.  Then he  peeked up all the sections of both worms, packing them into his beak  somehow, and flew off.  And the robin who was watching him didn't even  trouble to fly down to the spot and see if he had left a joint behind.  He knew his blackbird, it seemed.    Blackie flew away to his nest, but not to a nest in a hedge.  To dwell  in a hedge was a rule of his clan, but the devil a rule did he obey.  Nests in hedges for other blackbirds, perhaps.  He, or his wife, had  different notions.  Wherefore flew he away out into the grass field  behind the garden.  Men had been making excavations there, for what mad  man-purpose troubled him not--digging a drain or something.  No matter.    Into the excavation he slipped---very, very secretly, so that nobody  could have seen him go there--and down to the far end, where, twelve  feet"]]]
