We will now translate another poem (carefully preserving all the  tautological phraseology), a hymn      To DAWN _(Rig Veda_ VI. 64).      Aloft the lights of Dawn, for beauty gleaming,    Have risen resplendent, like to waves of water;    She makes fair paths, (makes) all accessible;    And good is she, munificent and kindly.      Thou lovely lookest, through wide spaces shin'st thou,    Up fly thy fiery shining beams to heaven;    Thy bosom thou reveals't, thyself adorning,    Aurora, goddess gleaming bright in greatness.      The ruddy kine (the clouds) resplendent bear her,    The blessed One, who far and wide extendeth.    As routs his foes a hero armed with arrows,    As driver swift, so she compels the darkness.      Thy ways are fair; thy paths, upon the mountains;    In calm, self-shining one, thou cross'st the waters.    O thou whose paths are wide, to us, thou lofty    Daughter of Heaven, bring wealth for our subsistence.      Bring (wealth), thou Dawn, who, with the kine, untroubled    Dost bring us good commensurate with pleasure,    Daughter of Heaven, who, though thou art a goddess,    Didst aye at morning-call come bright and early.      Aloft the birds fly ever from their dwelling,    And men, who seek for food, at thy clear dawning.    E'en though a mortal stay at home and serve thee,    Much joy to him, Dawn, goddess (bright), thou bringest.    The \"morning call\" might, indeed, suggest the ritual, but it proves  only a morning prayer or offering. Is this poem of a \"singularly  refined character,\" or \"preeminently sacerdotal\" in appearance? One  other example (in still a different metre) may be examined, to see if  it bear on its face evidence of having been made with \"reference to  ritual application,\" or of being \"liturgical from the very start.\"      To INDRA _(Rig Veda_, I.11).      'Tis Indra all (our) songs extol,    Him huge as ocean in extent;    Of warriors chiefest warrior he,    Lord, truest lord for booty's gain.      In friendship, Indra, strong as thine    Naught will we fear, O lord of strength;    To thee we our laudations sing,    The conqueror unconquered.[25]      The gifts of Indra many are,    And inexhaustible his help    Whene'er to them that praise he gives    The gift of booty rich in kine.      A fortress-render, youthful, wise,    Immeasurably strong was born    Indra, the doer of every deed,    The lightning-holder, far renowned.      'Twas thou, Bolt-holder, rent'st the cave    Of Val, who held the (heavenly) kine;[26]    Thee helped the (shining) gods, when roused    (To courage) by the fearless one.[27]      Indra, who lords it by his strength,    Our praises now have loud proclaimed;    His generous gifts a thousand are,    Aye, even more than this are they.    This is poetry. Not great poetry perhaps, but certainly not ground out  to order, as some of the hymns appear to have been. Yet, it may be  said, why could not a poetic hymn have been written in a ritualistic  environment? But it is on the hymns themselves that one is forced to  depend for the belief in the existence of ritualism, and we claim that  such hymns as these, which we have translated as literally as  possible, show rather that they were composed without reference to  ritual application. It must not be forgotten that the ritual, as it is  known in the Br[=a]hmanas, without the slightest doubt, from the point  of view of language, social conditions, and theology, represents an  age that is very different to that illustrated by the mass of the  hymns. Such hymns, therefore, and only such as can be proved to have a  ritualistic setting can be referred to a ritualistic age. There is no  convincing reason why one should not take the fully justified view  that some of the hymns represent a freer and more natural (less  priest-bound) age, as they represent a spirit freer and less  mechanical than that of other hymns. As to the question which hymns,  early or late, be due to poetic feeling, and which to ritualistic  mechanism or servile imitation, this can indeed be decided by a  judgment based only on the literary quality, never on the accident of  subsequent rubrication.    We hold, therefore, in this regard, that the new school, valuable and  suggestive as its work has been, is gone already farther than is  judicious. The Rig Veda in part is synchronous with an advanced  ritualism, subjected to it, and in some cases derived from it; but in  part the hymns are \"made for their own sake and not for the sake of  any sacrificial performance,\" as said Muller of the whole; going in  this too far, but not into greater error than are gone they that  confuse the natural with the artificial, the poetical with the  mechanical, gold with dross. It may be true that the books of the Rig  Veda are chiefly family-books for the _soma_-cult, but even were it  true it would in no wise impugn the poetic character of some of the  hymns contained in these books. The drag-net has scooped up old and  new, good and bad, together. The Rig Veda is not of one period or of  one sort. It is a 'Collection,' as says its name. It is essentially  impossible that any sweeping statement in regard to its character  should be true if that character be regarded as uniform. To say that  the Rig Veda represents an age of childlike thought, a period before  the priestly ritual began its spiritual blight, is incorrect. But no  less incorrect is it to assert that the Rig Veda represents a period  when hymns are made only for rubrication by priests that sing only for  baksheesh. Scholars are too prone to-day to speak of the Rig Veda in  the same way as the Greeks spoke of Homer. It is to be hoped that the  time may soon come when critics will no longer talk about the  Collection as if it were all made in the same circumstances and at the  same time; above all is it desirable that the literary quality of the  hymns may receive due attention, and that there may be less of those  universal asseverations which treat the productions of generations of  poets as if they were the work of a single author.    In respect of the method of reading into the Rig Veda what is found in  parallel passages in the Atharva Veda and Br[=a]hmanas, a practice  much favored by Ludwig and others, the results of its application have  been singularly futile in passages of importance. Often a varied  reading will make clearer a doubtful verse, but it by no means follows  that the better reading is the truer. There always remains the lurking  suspicion that the reason the variant is more intelligible is that its  inventor did not understand the original. As to real elucidation of  other sort by the later texts, in the minutiae of the outer world, in  details of priestcraft, one may trust early tradition tentatively,  just as one does late commentators, but in respect of ideas tradition  is as apt to mislead as to lead well. The cleft between the theology  of the Rig Veda and that of the Br[=a]hmanas, even from the point of  view of the mass of hymns that comprise the former, is too great to  allow us with any content to explain the conceptions of the one by  those of the other. A tradition always is useful when nothing else  offers itself, but traditional beliefs are so apt to take the color of  new eras that they should be employed only in the last emergency, and  then with the understanding that they are of very hypothetical value.    In conclusion a practical question remains to be answered. In the few  cases where the physical basis of a Rig Vedic deity is matter of  doubt, it is advisable to present such a deity in the form in which he  stands in the text or to endeavor historically to elucidate the figure  by searching for his physical prototype? We have chosen the former  alternative, partly because we think the latter method unsuitable to a  handbook, since it involves many critical discussions of theories of  doubtful value. But this is not the chief reason. Granted that the  object of study is simply to know the Rig Veda, rightly to grasp the  views held by the poets, and so to place oneself upon their plane of  thought, it becomes obvious that the farther the student gets from  their point of view the less he understands them. Nay, more, every bit  of information, real as well as fancied, which in regard to the poets'  own divinities furnishes one with more than the poets themselves knew  or imagined, is prejudicial to a true knowledge of Vedic beliefs. Here  if anywhere is applicable that test of desirable knowledge formulated  as _das Erkennen des Erkannten_. To set oneself in the mental sphere  of the Vedic seers, as far as possible to think their thoughts, to  love, fear, and admire with them--this is the necessary beginning of  intimacy, which precedes the appreciation that gives understanding.      DIVISIONS OF THE SUBJECT.    After the next chapter, which deals with the people and land, we shall  begin the examination of Hindu religions with the study of the beliefs  and religious notions to be found in the Rig Veda. Next to the Rig  Veda in time stands the Atharva Veda, which represents a growing  demonology in contrast with _soma_-worship and theology; sufficiently  so at least to deserve a special chapter. These two Vedic Collections  naturally form the first period of Hindu religion.    The Vedic period is followed by what is usually termed Brahmanism, the  religion that is inculcated in the rituals called Br[=a]hmana and its  later development in the Upanishads. These two classes of works,  together with the Yajur Veda, will make the next divisions of the  whole subject. The formal religion of Brahmanism, as laid down for  popular use and instruction in the law-books, is a side of Brahmanic  religion that scarcely has been noticed, but it seems to deserve all  the space allotted to it in the chapter on 'The Popular Brahmanic  Faith.' We shall then review Jainism and Buddhism, the two chief  heresies. Brahmanism"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#5)"],[1,"predominate. With children of more nervous  temperament it is clear that sensations of taste are much more acute.  Even in earliest infancy, children have a way of proclaiming their  nervous inheritance by the repugnance which they show to even trifling  changes in the taste or composition of their food. We see the same  sensitiveness in their behaviour to medicines. The mixture which one  child will swallow without resentment, and almost eagerly, provokes  every expression of disgust from another, or is even vomited at once.  In piloting the child through this phase, during which he starts  nervously at all unaccustomed sensations and flavours, the attitude of  mother and nurse is of supreme importance. It is unwise to attempt  force; it is equally unwise, by excessive coaxing, cajoling, and  entreaty, to concentrate the child's attention on the matter. If  either is tried every meal is apt to become a signal for struggling  and tears. The phase, whether it is short or long continued, must be  accepted as in the natural order of things, and patience will see its  end. The management of this symptom,--refusal of food and an  apparently complete absence of desire for food,--which is almost the  commonest neurosis of childhood, will be dealt with later. Here it is  mentioned because I wish to emphasise that if too much is made of a  passing hesitation over any one article of food, if it becomes the  belief of the mother or nurse that a strong distaste is present, then  if she is not careful her attitude in offering it, because she is  apprehensive of refusal, will exert a powerful suggestion on the  child's mind. Still worse, it may cause words to be used in the  child's hearing referring to this peculiarity of his. By frequent  repetition it becomes fixed in his mind that this is part of his own  individuality. He sees himself--and takes great pleasure in the  thought--as a strange child, who by these peculiarities creates  considerable interest in the minds of the grown-up people around him.  When the suggestion takes root it becomes fixed, and as likely as not  it will persist for his lifetime. It may be habitually said of a child  that, unlike his brothers and sisters, he will never eat bananas, and  thereafter till the day of his death he may feel it almost a physical  impossibility to gulp down a morsel of the offending fruit. So, too,  there are people who can bolt their food with the best of us, who yet  declare themselves incapable of swallowing a pill.    Another example of the force of suggestion, whether unconscious or  openly exercised by speech, is given us in the matter of sleep. Among  adults the act of going to bed serves as a powerful suggestion to  induce sleep. Seldom do we seek rest so tired physically that we drop  off to sleep from the irresistible force of sheer exhaustion. Yet as  soon as the healthy man whose mind is at peace, whose nerves are not  on edge, finds himself in bed, his eyes close almost with the force of  a hypnotic suggestion, and he drops off to sleep. With some of us the  suggestion is only powerful in our own bed, that on which it has acted  on unnumbered nights. We cannot, as we say, sleep in a strange bed. It  is suggestion, not direct will power, that acts. No one can absolutely  will himself to sleep. In insomnia it is the attempt to replace the  unconscious auto-suggestion by a conscious voluntary effort of will  that causes the difficulty. A thousand times in the night we resolve  that now we _will_ sleep. If we could but cease to make these  fruitless efforts, sleep might come of itself and the suggestion or  habit be re-established.    In little children the suggestion of sleep, provoked by being placed  in bed, sometimes acts very irregularly. Often it may succeed for a  week or two, and then some untoward happening breaks the habit, and  night after night, for a long time, sleep is refused. The wakeful  child put to bed, resents the process, and cries and sobs miserably,  to the infinite distress of his mother. It then becomes just as likely  that the child will connect his bed in his mind, not with rest and  sleep, but with sobbing and crying on his part, and mingled entreaties  and scoldings from his nurse or mother. An important part in this  perversion of the suggestion is played by the attitude of the person  who puts the child to bed. Often the nurse is uniformly successful,  while the mother, who is perhaps more distressed by the sobbing of the  child, as consistently fails, because she has been unable to hide her  apprehension from him, and has conveyed to his mind a sense of his own  power.    Just in the same way, grown-up people, filled with anxiety because of  the helplessness of the young child, unable to divest their minds of  the fears of the hundred and one accidents that may befall, or that  within their own experience have befallen, a little child at one time  or another, unconsciously make unwise suggestions which fill his mind  with apprehension and terror. They do not like their children to show  fear of animals. Nor would they if it were not that their own  apprehension that the child may be hurt communicates itself to him.  The child is not of himself afraid to fall, it is they who suffer the  anxiety and show it by treating the fall as a disaster. The child is  not of himself afraid to be left alone in a room. It is they who sap  his confidence in himself, because they do not venture to leave him  out of their sight, from a nameless dread of what may happen. A little  girl cut her finger and ran to her nurse, pleased and interested:  \"See,\" she said, seeing it bleed, \"fingers all jammy.\" Only when the  nurse grasped her with unwise expressions of horror did she break into  cries of fear. A town-bred nurse, who is afraid of cows, will make  every country walk an ordeal of fear for the children.    Every mother must be made to realise the ease with which these  unconscious suggestions act upon the mind of the little child, and  should school herself to be strong to make her child strong, and to  see to it that all this suggestive force is utilised for good and not  for evil.    It is upon this susceptibility to suggestion that a great part of his  early education reposes. No one who is incapable of profiting by this  natural disposition of the child can be successful in her management  of him. Turn where you will in his daily life the influence of this  force of suggestion is clearly apparent. The child does without  questioning that which he is confidently expected to do. Thus he will  eat what is given him, and sleep soundly when he is put to bed if only  the appropriate suggestion and not the contrary is made to him. Again  we have seen that a perversion of suggestion of this sort is a common  source of constipation in early childhood. If the child's attention is  directed towards the difficulty, if he is urged or ordered or appealed  to to perform his part, if failure is looked upon as a serious  misfortune, the bowels may remain obstinately unmoved. In children as  in adults a too great concentration of attention inhibits the action  of the bowels, and constipation, in many persons, is due to the  attempt to substitute will power for the force of habitual suggestion.  No matter what other treatment we adopt, the mother must be careful to  hide from the child that his failure is distressing to her. A cheerful  optimism which teaches him to regard himself as one who is  conspicuously regular in his habits, and who has a reputation in this  respect to live up to is sure to succeed. To talk before him of his  habitual constipation, and to worry over the difficulty, is as surely  to fail. In the same way unwise suggestion can interfere with the  passing of water at regular and suitable intervals. There are children  who constantly desire to pass water on any occasion, which is  conspicuously inappropriate, because their attention has been  concentrated on the sensations in the bladder. Often enough when at  great inconvenience opportunity has been found, the desire has passed  away, and all the trouble has proved needless. It is not too much to  say that every occupation and every action of the day can be made  delightful or hateful to the child, according to the suggestion with  which it is presented and introduced. Dressing and undressing, eating  and drinking, bathing, washing, the putting away of toys, even going  to bed, can be made matters of enthralling interest or delight, or a  subject for tears and opposition, according to the bias which is given  to the child's mind by the words, attitude, and actions of nurses and  mothers.    Here we approach very near to the heart of the subject. Stripped of  all that is not essential we see the problem of the management of  children reduced to the interplay between the adult mind and the mind  of the receptive suggestible child. That which is thought of and  feared for the child, that he rapidly becomes. Placid, comfortable  people who do not worry about their children find their children  sensible and easy to manage. Parents who take a pride in the daring  and naughty pranks of their children unconsciously convey the  suggestion to their minds that such conduct is characteristic of them.  Nervous and apprehensive parents who are distressed when the child  refuses to eat or to sleep, and who worry all day long over possible  sources of danger to him, are forced to watch their child acquire a  reputation for nervousness, which, as always, is passively accepted  and consistently acted up to. Differences in type, determined by  hereditary factors, no doubt, exist and are often strongly marked. Yet  it is not untrue to say that variations in children, dependent upon  heredity, show chiefly in the relative susceptibility or  insusceptibility of the child to the influences of environment and  management. It is no easy task to distinguish between the nervous  child and the child of the"]]]
