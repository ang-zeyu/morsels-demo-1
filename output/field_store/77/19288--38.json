It substitutes for the pupil's snap judgment, given without much  thought and too frequently influenced by the inflection of the teacher's  voice, an opinion that has resulted from research and deliberation  unbiased by the teacher's personal views.    It is too much to expect high school pupils to solve historical problems  extemporaneously. If inferences and contrasts other than those given in  the text are to be drawn, if statements are to be defended or opposed,  the high school student should be given time to prepare his answer.  Aside from the injustice of any other procedure, it is a hopeless waste  of time to spend the precious minutes of the recitation in gathering  negative replies and worthless judgments.      _Methods of preparing questions assigned in advance_    It may be urged that such an assignment of a lesson as that proposed is  too ambitious and that it exacts too much of the teacher's time. In  answer it should be said that specialists in history ought surely to  have read widely enough and studied deeply enough to be _able_ to select  intelligent questions of the sort suggested. We have assumed that the  teacher has made adequate preparation for his work. Certainly, then, he  should be ready to explain the social, geographical, and economic  relation of the events mentioned in the lesson. He should know their  bearing on current history. He should always have ready a fund of  information, additional to that given in the text. In preparing advance  questions for distribution to the class the teacher is preparing his own  lesson. He may be doing it a day or two earlier than he would otherwise  do, but surely he is performing no labor additional to what may  reasonably be expected of him. As to the time required to prepare copies  of the questions for distribution when the class convenes, it may be  said that a neostyle or mimeograph, with which all large schools and  many small ones are equipped, makes short work of preparing as many  copies of the questions as desired. If there is a commercial department  in connection with the school, an available stenographer, or a willing  student helper, the teacher may easily relieve himself of the work of  supplying the copies. If none of these expedients are possible, it is no  Herculean task to write each day on the board the few questions for the  next lesson. It will entail no great loss of time if the class are asked  to copy them when they first come to recitation. If it is possible to  copy them after the recitation, so much the better. And beyond the  obvious advantages of a carefully assigned lesson it must be remembered  that in the assignment of special topics, in private conferences with  the student, in the correction of notes, in giving assistance in the  library, the teacher has an opportunity to cultivate a sympathetic  relation between himself and the class of inestimable service in  securing the best results.          IV    THE METHOD OF THE RECITATION      _Assumptions as to the recitation room_    Let us now assume that the recitation will be held in a quiet room free  from the distracting influence of poor light, poor ventilation, and  inadequate seating capacity. The blackboard space is ample for the whole  class, the erasers and chalk are at hand, the maps, charts, and globe  are where they can be used without stumbling over them. The teacher can  give his whole attention to the class. Discipline should take care of  itself. The pupil who is interested will not be seriously out of order.      _What the teacher should aim to accomplish_    The problem, then, is so to expend the forty-five minutes in which the  teacher and class are together that:--         1. So far as possible the atmosphere and setting of the period          being studied may be reproduced.         2. The great historical characters spoken of in the lesson may          become for the student real men and women with whom he will          afterwards feel a personal acquaintance.         3. The events described will be understood and properly interpreted          in their relation to geography, and the economic and social          progress of the world.         4. Causes and effects shall be properly analyzed.         5. And that there shall be left sufficient time for the occasional          review necessary to any good instruction.      _Work at the blackboard_    The first five minutes may profitably be spent at the board, each member  of the class being asked to write a complete answer to one of the  assigned questions. Whatever may happen later in the recitation each  student has had at least this much of an opportunity for  self-expression, and his work should be neat, workmanlike, complete, and  accurate. By this device the alert teacher will secure in the first five  minutes of the recitation hour a fairly accurate idea of each student's  preparation, the weak spots in his understanding of the lesson, and the  errors to be corrected. He may even be able to record a grade for the  work done.      _Special reports_    The class having taken their seats, the next order of business should be  the reports on special topics assigned for the purpose of making the  period of history under discussion more interesting and vital. As has  been said, these reports should not be read, but delivered by the pupil  facing the class. The class should be encouraged to ask questions on the  report when finished and the student responsible for the report should  be expected to answer any reasonable inquiry. If other students are able  to contribute to the topics reported on, they should be encouraged to do  so. Let the teacher be sure that he has sounded the depths of the  students' information and curiosity before he himself discusses the  report. If the device of reports delivered in class is to justify  itself, the matter contained in them must be so arranged and discussed  that the whole class receives real benefit. The ingenious teacher will  be able to establish a tradition in his course for a careful preparation  and critical discussion of these reports. The rivalry of students for  excellence in this work is not difficult to stimulate. A premium should  be put on criticism which finds mentioned in the characterization  qualities inconsistent with the facts recorded in the text, or omissions  which the facts of the text seem to justify.      _Fundamental principles of good questioning_    It is not likely that the teacher will find it advisable to require  reports at every recitation nor that the reports and their discussion  will consume, at the most, longer than ten or fifteen minutes of any  class period. There must always be time for direct oral questioning on  the facts of the lesson; questioning that will test the student's  memory, ability to analyze, and powers of expression. Certain principles  are fundamental to good questioning in any recitation.         1. The questions should be brief.         2. They should be prepared by the teacher before coming to          recitation. This will insure rapidity. A vast deal of time is          lost by the unfortunate habit possessed by many teachers of          never having the next question ready to use.         3. They should precede the name of the pupil required to answer it.         4. They should not be leading questions to which the pupil can          guess the answers.         5. They should be grammatically stated with but one possible          interpretation.         6. Except for purposes of rapid review they should not be          answerable with yes or no.         7. They should be asked in a voice loud enough to be heard by all          the class, and only once.         8. They should be asked in no regular order, but nevertheless in          such a way that every member of the class will have a chance to          recite.        _Some additional suggestions for teachers of history_    There are additional suggestions particularly applicable to the teacher  of history.         1. In all the questioning remember the purposes of the recitation.          Ask questions knowing exactly what you wish as an answer. There          is no time for aimless or idle questioning.         2. Inquire frequently as to the books used in preparation of the          lesson. Let no allusion or statement in the text go unexplained.          Let none of the author's conclusions or opinions go          unchallenged. Ask the student for inconsistencies, inaccuracies,          or contradictions in the text. Put a premium on their discovery.          Insist on the student's authority for statements other than          those given in the text.         3. Do not use the heavy-typed words frequently found at the head of          the paragraph or the topical heads furnished by the text, if it          can be avoided. The pupil should not be allowed to remember his          history by its location in the text.         4. Be sure that the class have an opportunity to recite on the          questions assigned for their advance preparation. Nothing is          more discouraging to a student than carefully to prepare the          work required and then fail of an opportunity either to recite          upon or to discuss it.         5. Discover the tastes, shortcomings, and abilities of your          individual students and direct your future questions          accordingly. There will usually be in the class the boy who is          glib without being accurate. He should be questioned on definite          facts. There will be the student whose analysis of events is          good, but whose powers of description are poor. Adapt your          questions to his special need. There will be the pupil with the          tendency to memorize the text _verbatim_. There will be the          student who knows the facts of the lesson, but who fails to          remember the sequence of events--the kind who never can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1458"],[0,"Dream Life and Real Life: A Little African Story (#5)"],[1," together. You don't know how beautiful all life is to  me. I know now that the old passion was only a girl's foolish dream.  My husband is the first man I have ever truly loved. He loves me and  understands me as no other man ever could. I am thankful that my dream  was broken; God had better things in store for me. I don't hate that  woman any more; I love every one! How are you, dear? We shall come and  see you as soon as we arrive in England. I always think of you so happy  in your great work and helping other people. I don't think now it is  terrible to be a woman; it is lovely.    \"I hope you are enjoying this beautiful spring weather.    \"Yours, always full of gratitude and love,    \"E--.\"    The woman read the letter: then she stood up and walked towards the  fire. She did not re-read it, but stood with it open in her hand,  looking down into the blaze. Her lips were drawn in at the corners.  Presently she tore the letter up slowly, and watched the bits floating  down one by one into the grate. Then she went back to her desk, and  began to write, with her mouth still drawn in at the corners. After a  while she laid her arm on the paper and her head on her arm, and seemed  to go to sleep there.    Presently the servant knocked; the boy was waiting. \"Tell him to wait  ten minutes more.\" She took up her pen--\"The Policy of the Australian  Colonies in favour of Protection is easily understood--\" she  waited--\"when one considers the fact--the fact--;\" then she finished the  article.
