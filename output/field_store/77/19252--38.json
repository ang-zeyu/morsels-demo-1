STOCK.    Six pounds of shin of beef, or six pounds of knuckle of veal; any  bones, trimmings of poultry, or fresh meat; one-quarter pound of lean  bacon or ham, two ounces of butter, two large onions, each stuck with  cloves; one turnip, three carrots, one head of celery, two ounces of  salt, one-half teaspoonful of whole pepper, one large blade of mace,  one bunch of savory herbs except sage, four quarts and one-half-pint  of cold water.    Cut up the meat and bacon, or ham, into pieces of about three inches  square; break the bones into small pieces, rub the butter on the  bottom of the stewpan; put in one-half a pint of water, the broken  bones, then meat and all other ingredients. Cover the stewpan, and  place it on a sharp fire, occasionally stirring its contents. When the  bottom of the pan becomes covered with a pale, jelly-like substance,  add the four quarts of cold water, and simmer very gently for five or  six hours. As we have said before, do not let it boil quickly. When  nearly cooked, throw in a tablespoonful of salt to assist the scum to  rise. Remove every particle of scum whilst it is doing, and strain it  through a fine hair sieve; when cool remove all grease. This stock  will keep for many days in cold weather.    Stock is the basis of many of the soups afterwards mentioned, and this  will be found quite strong enough for ordinary purposes. Keep it in  small jars, in a cool place. It makes a good gravy for hash meats;  one tablespoonful of it is sufficient to impart a fine flavor to a  dish of macaroni and various other dishes. Good soups of various kinds  are made from it at short notice; slice off a portion of the jelly,  add water, and whatever vegetables and thickening preferred. It is  best to partly cook the vegetables before adding to the stock, as much  boiling injures the flavoring of the soup. Season and boil a few  moments and serve hot.    [Illustration: FRANCES FOLSOM CLEVELAND.]      WHITE STOCK.    White stock is used in the preparation of white soups, and is made by  boiling six pounds of a knuckle of veal, cut up in small pieces,  poultry trimmings, and four slices of lean ham. Proceed according to  directions given in STOCK, on opposite page.      TO CLARIFY STOCK.    Place the stock in a clean saucepan, set it over a brisk fire. When  boiling, add the white of one egg to each quart of stock, proceeding  as follows: beat the whites of the eggs up well in a little water;  then add a little hot stock; beat to a froth and pour gradually into  the pot; then beat the whole hard and long; allow it to boil up once,  and immediately remove and strain through a thin flannel cloth.      BEEF SOUP.    Select a small shin of beef of moderate size, crack the bone in small  pieces, wash and place it in a kettle to boil, with five or six quarts  of _cold_ water. Let it boil about two hours, or until it begins to  get tender, then season it with a tablespoonful of salt, and a  teaspoonful of pepper; boil it one hour longer, then add to it one  carrot, two turnips, two tablespoonfuls of rice or pearl barley, one  head of celery, and a teaspoonful of summer savory powdered fine; the  vegetables to be minced up in small pieces like dice. After these  ingredients have boiled a quarter of an hour, put in two potatoes cut  up in small pieces, let it boil half an hour longer; take the meat  from the soup, and if intended to be served with it, take out the  bones and lay it closely and neatly on a dish, and garnish with sprigs  of parsley.    Serve made mustard and catsup with it. It is very nice pressed and  eaten cold with mustard and vinegar, or catsup. Four hours are  required for making this soup. Should any remain over the first day,  it may be heated, with the addition of a little boiling water, and  served again. Some fancy a glass of brown sherry added just before  being served. Serve very hot.      VEAL SOUP. (Excellent.)    Put a knuckle of veal into three quarts of cold water, with a small  quantity of salt, and one small tablespoonful of uncooked rice. Boil  slowly, hardly above simmering, four hours, when the liquor should be  reduced to half the usual quantity; remove from the fire. Into the  tureen put the yolk of one egg, and stir well into it a teacupful of  cream, or, in hot weather, new milk; add a piece of butter the size of  a hickory nut; on this strain the soup, boiling hot, stirring all the  time. Just at the last, beat it well for a minute.      SCOTCH MUTTON BROTH.    Six pounds neck of mutton, three quarts water, five carrots, five  turnips, two onions, four tablespoonfuls barley, a little salt. Soak  mutton in water for an hour, cut off scrag, and put it in stewpan with  three quarts of water. As soon as it boils, skim well, and then simmer  for one and one-half hours. Cut best end of mutton into cutlets,  dividing it with two bones in each; take off nearly all fat before you  put it into broth; skim the moment the meat boils, and every ten  minutes afterwards; add carrots, turnips and onions, all cut into two  or three pieces, then put them into soup soon enough to be thoroughly  done; stir in barley; add salt to taste; let all stew together for  three and one-half hours; about one-half hour before sending it to  table, put in little chopped parsley and serve.    Cut the meat off the scrag into small pieces, and send it to table in  the tureen with the soup. The other half of the mutton should be  served on a separate dish, with whole turnips boiled and laid round  it. Many persons are fond of mutton that has been boiled in soup.    You may thicken the soup with rice or barley that has first been  soaked in cold water, or with green peas, or with young corn, cut down  from the cob, or with tomatoes, scalded, peeled and cut into pieces.      GAME SOUP.    Two grouse or partridges, or, if you have neither, use a pair of  rabbits; half a pound of lean ham; two medium-sized onions; one pound  of lean beef; fried bread; butter for frying; pepper, salt and two  stalks of white celery cut into inch lengths; three quarts of water.    Joint your game neatly; cut the ham and onions into small pieces, fry  all in butter to a light brown. Put into a soup-pot with the beef, cut  into strips, add a little pepper. Pour on the water; heat slowly, and  stew gently two hours. Take out the pieces of bird, and cover in a  bowl; cook the soup an hour longer; strain; cool; drop in the celery  and simmer ten minutes. Pour upon fried bread in the tureen.    Venison soup made the same, with the addition of a tablespoonful of  brown flour wet into a paste with cold water, adding a tablespoonful  of catsup, Worcestershire, or other pungent sauce, and a glass of  Madeira or brown sherry.      CONSOMME SOUP.    Take good strong stock (see pages 27 and 30), remove all fat from the  surface, and for each quart of the stock allow the white and shell of  one egg and a tablespoonful of water, well whipped together. Pour this  mixture into a saucepan containing the stock; place it over the fire  and heat the contents gradually, stirring often to prevent the egg  from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. Allow it to boil gently  until the stock looks perfectly clear under the egg, which will rise  and float upon the surface in the form of a thick white scum. Now  remove it and pour it into a folded towel laid in a colander set over  an earthen bowl, allowing it to run through without moving or  squeezing it. Season with more salt if needed, and quickly serve very  hot. This should be a clear amber color.      JULIENNE SOUP.    Cut carrots and turnips into quarter-inch pieces the shape of dice;  also celery into thin slices. Cover them with boiling water; add a  teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful pepper, and cook until soft.  In another saucepan have two quarts of boiling stock (see pages 27 and  30), to which add the cooked vegetables, the water and more seasoning  if necessary. Serve hot.    In the spring and summer season use asparagus, peas and string  beans--all cut into small uniform thickness.      CREAM OF SPINACH.    Pick, wash and boil enough spinach to measure a pint, when cooked,  chopped and pounded into a soft paste. Put it into a stewpan with four  ounces of fresh butter, a little grated nutmeg, a teaspoonful of salt.  Cook and stir it about ten minutes. Add to this two quarts of strong  stock (see pages 27 and 30); let boil up, then rub it through a  strainer. Set it over the fire again, and, when on the point of  boiling, mix with it a tablespoonful of butter, and a teaspoonful of  granulated sugar.      CHICKEN CREAM SOUP.    An old chicken for soup is much the best. Cut it up into quarters, put  it into a soup kettle with half a pound of corned ham, and an onion;  add four quarts of cold water. Bring slowly to a gentle boil, and keep  this up until the liquid has diminished one-third, and the meat drops  from the bones; then add half a cup of rice. Season with salt, pepper  and a bunch of chopped parsley.    Cook slowly until the rice is tender, then the meat should be taken  out. Now stir in two cups of rich milk thickened with a little flour.  The chicken could be fried in a spoonful of butter and a gravy made,  reserving some of the white part of the meat, chopping it and adding  it to the soup.      PLAIN ECONOMICAL SOUP.    Take a cold roast-beef bone, pieces of beefsteak, the rack of a cold  turkey or chicken. Put them into a pot with three or four quarts of  water, two carrots, three turnips, one onion, a few cloves, pepper and  salt. Boil the whole gently four hours; then strain it through a  colander, mashing the vegetables so that they will all pass through.  Skim off the fat, and return the soup to the pot. Mix one  tablespoonful of flour with two of water, stir it into the soup and  boil the whole ten minutes.

His cowboys took advantage of him,  his neighbors imposed upon him, but none were there who did not make  good their debts of service or stock. Belllounds was one of the great  pioneers of the frontier days to whom the West owed its settlement; and  he was finer than most, because he proved that the Indians, if not  robbed or driven, would respond to friendliness.           *       *       *       *       *    Belllounds was not seen at his customary tasks on the day he expected  his son. He walked in the fields and around the corrals; he often paced  up and down the porch, scanning the horizon below, where the road from  Kremmling showed white down the valley; and part of the time he  stayed indoors.    It so happened that early in the afternoon he came out in time to see a  buckboard, drawn by dust-and-lather-stained horses, pull into the yard.  And then he saw his son. Some of the cowboys came running. There were  greetings to the driver, who appeared well known to them.    Jack Belllounds did not look at them. He threw a bag out of the  buckboard and then clambered down slowly, to go toward the porch.    \"Wal, Jack--my son--I'm sure glad you're back home,\" said the old  rancher, striding forward. His voice was deep and full, singularly rich.  But that was the only sign of feeling he showed.    \"Howdy--dad!\" replied the son, not heartily, as he put out his hand to  his father's.    Jack Belllounds's form was tall, with a promise of his father's bulk.  But he did not walk erect; he slouched a little. His face was pale,  showing he had not of late been used to sun and wind. Any stranger would  have seen the resemblance of boy to man would have granted the handsome  boldness, but denied the strength. The lower part of Jack Belllounds's  face was weak.    The constraint of this meeting was manifest mostly in the manner of the  son. He looked ashamed, almost sullen. But if he had been under the  influence of liquor at Kremmling, as reported the day before, he had  entirely recovered.    \"Come on in,\" said the rancher.    When they got into the big living-room, and Belllounds had closed the  doors, the son threw down his baggage and faced his father aggressively.    \"Do they all know where I've been?\" he asked, bitterly. Broken pride and  shame flamed in his face.    \"Nobody knows. The secret's been kept.\" replied Belllounds.    Amaze and relief transformed the young man. \"Aw, now, I'm--glad--\" he  exclaimed, and he sat down, half covering his face with shaking hands.    \"Jack, we'll start over,\" said Belllounds, earnestly, and his big eyes  shone with a warm and beautiful light. \"Right hyar. We'll never speak of  where you've been these three years. Never again!\"    Jack gazed up, then, with all the sullenness and shadow gone.    \"Father, you were wrong about--doing me good. It's done me harm. But  now, if nobody knows--why, I'll try to forget it.\"    \"Mebbe I blundered,\" replied Belllounds, pathetically. \"Yet, God knows I  meant well. You sure were--But thet's enough palaver.... You'll go to  work as foreman of White Slides. An' if you make a success of it I'll be  only too glad to have you boss the ranch. I'm gettin' along in years,  son. An' the last year has made me poorer. Hyar's a fine range, but I've  less stock this year than last. There's been some rustlin' of cattle,  an a big loss from wolves an' lions an' poison-weed.... What d'you  say, son?\"    \"I'll run White Slides,\" replied Jack, with a wave of his hand. \"I  hadn't hoped for such a chance. But it's due me. Who's in the outfit  I know?\"    \"Reckon no one, except Wils Moore.\"    \"Is that cowboy here yet? I don't want him.\"    \"Wal, I'll put him to chasin' varmints with the hounds. An' say, son,  this outfit is bad. You savvy--it's bad. You can't run that bunch. The  only way you can handle them is to get up early an' come back late.  Sayin' little, but sawin' wood. Hard work.\"    Jack Belllounds did not evince any sign of assimilating the seriousness  of his father's words.    \"I'll show them,\" he said. \"They'll find out who's boss. Oh, I'm aching  to get into boots and ride and tear around.\"    Belllounds stroked his grizzled beard and regarded his son with mingled  pride and doubt. Not at this moment, most assuredly, could he get away  from the wonderful fact that his only son was home.    \"Thet's all right, son. But you've been off the range fer three years.  You'll need advice. Now listen. Be gentle with hosses. You used to be  mean with a hoss. Some cowboys jam their hosses around an' make 'em  pitch an' bite. But it ain't the best way. A hoss has got sense. I've  some fine stock, an' don't want it spoiled. An' be easy an' quiet with  the boys. It's hard to get help these days. I'm short on hands now....  You'd do best, son, to stick to your dad's ways with hosses an' men.\"    \"Dad, I've seen you kick horses an' shoot at men\" replied Jack.    \"Right, you have. But them was particular bad cases. I'm not advisin'  thet way.... Son, it's close to my heart--this hope I have  thet you'll--\"    The full voice quavered and broke. It would indeed have been a hardened  youth who could not have felt something of the deep and unutterable  affection in the old man. Jack Belllounds put an arm around his  father's shoulder.    \"Dad, I'll make you proud of me yet. Give me a chance. And don't be sore  if I can't do wonders right at first.\"    \"Son, you shall have every chance. An' thet reminds me. Do you remember  Columbine?\"    \"I should say so,\" replied Jack, eagerly. \"They spoke of her in  Kremmling. Where is she?\"    \"I reckon somewheres about. Jack, you an' Columbine are to marry.\"    \"Marry! Columbine and me?\" he ejaculated.    \"Yes. You're my son an' she's my adopted daughter. I won't split my  property. An' it's right she had a share. A fine, strong, quiet, pretty  lass, Jack, an' she'll make a good wife. I've set my heart on the idee.\"    \"But Columbine always hated me.\"    \"Wal, she was a kid then an' you teased her. Now she's a woman, an'  willin' to please me. Jack, you'll not buck ag'in' this deal?\"    \"That depends,\" replied Jack. \"I'd marry `most any girl you wanted me  to. But if Columbine were to flout me as she used to--why, I'd buck sure  enough.... Dad, are you sure she knows nothing, suspects nothing of  where you--you sent me?\"    \"Son, I swear she doesn't.\"    \"Do you mean you'd want us to marry soon?\"    \"Wal, yes, as soon as Collie would think reasonable. Jack, she's shy an'  strange, an' deep, too. If you ever win her heart you'll be richer than  if you owned all the gold in the Rockies. I'd say go slow. But  contrariwise, it'd mebbe be surer to steady you, keep you home, if you  married right off.\"    \"Married right off!\" echoed Jack, with a laugh. \"It's like a story. But  wait till I see her.\"           *       *       *       *       *    At that very moment Columbine was sitting on the topmost log of a high  corral, deeply interested in the scene before her.    Two cowboys were in the corral with a saddled mustang. One of them  carried a canvas sack containing tools and horseshoes. As he dropped it  with a metallic clink the mustang snorted and jumped and rolled the  whites of his eyes. He knew what that clink meant.    \"Miss Collie, air you-all goin' to sit up thar?\" inquired the taller  cowboy, a lean, supple, and powerful fellow, with a rough, red-blue  face, hard as a rock, and steady, bright eyes.    \"I sure am, Jim,\" she replied, imperturbably.    \"But we've gotta hawg-tie him,\" protested the cowboy.    \"Yes, I know. And you're going to be gentle about it.\"    Jim scratched his sandy head and looked at his comrade, a little gnarled  fellow, like the bleached root of a tree. He seemed all legs.    \"You hear, you Wyomin' galoot,\" he said to Jim. \"Them shoes goes on  Whang right gentle.\"    Jim grinned, and turned to speak to his mustang. \"Whang, the law's laid  down an' we wanta see how much hoss sense you hev.\"    The shaggy mustang did not appear to be favorably impressed by this  speech. It was a mighty distrustful look he bent upon the speaker.    \"Jim, seein' as how this here job's aboot the last Miss Collie will ever  boss us on, we gotta do it without Whang turnin' a hair,\" drawled the  other cowboy.    \"Lem, why is this the last job I'll ever boss you boys?\" demanded  Columbine, quickly.    Jim gazed quizzically at her, and Lem assumed that blank, innocent face  Columbine always associated with cowboy deviltry.    \"Wal, Miss Collie, we reckon the new boss of White Slides rode in  to-day.\"    \"You mean Jack Belllounds came home,\" said Columbine. \"Well, I'll boss  you boys the same as always.\"    \"Thet'd be mighty fine for us, but I'm feared it ain't writ in the fatal  history of White Slides,\" replied Jim.    \"Buster Jack will run over the ole man an' marry you,\" added Lem.    \"Oh, so that's your idea,\" rejoined Columbine, lightly. \"Well, if such a  thing did come to pass I'd be your boss more than ever.\"    \"I reckon no, Miss Collie, for we'll not be ridin' fer White Sides,\"  said Jim, simply.    Columbine had sensed this very significance long before when the  possibility of Buster Jack's return had been rumored. She knew cowboys.  As well try to change the rocks of the hills!    \"Boys, the day you leave White Slides will be a sad one for me,\" sighed  Columbine.    \"Miss Collie, we 'ain't gone yet,\" put in Lem, with awkward softness.  \"Jim has long hankered fer Wyomin' an' he jest talks thet way.\"    Then the cowboys turned to the business in hand. Jim removed the saddle,  but left the bridle on. This move, of course, deceived Whang. He had  been broken to stand while his bridle hung, and, like a horse that would  have been good if given a chance, he obeyed as best he could, shaking  in every limb. Jim, apparently to hobble Whang, roped his forelegs  together, low down, but suddenly slipped the rope over the knees. Then  Whang knew he had been deceived. He snorted fire, let out a scream, and,"]]]
