These are attached to walls and supporting poles, and  in them offerings are made to the various spirits.    FIG. 11. COCOANUT SHELL SPOONS WITH WOODEN HANDLES.    FIG. 12. TAMBARA OR BASKET-LIKE RECEPTACLE IN WHICH OFFERINGS ARE MADE  TO THE SPIRITS.    This is our picture of a typical home. It is not a cheery place by day,  for the lack of windows, as well as a fog of smoke from the open stove,  makes it dark and gloomy. Nevertheless, since the house offers a cool  retreat from the blazing sun, and the smoke-laden air is free from flies  and mosquitoes, it is a popular resort for all members of the family  during the hottest part of the day. The little light, which filters in  through the many cracks in the floors and walls, is sufficient to allow  the women to spin, dye, weave, and decorate their clothing, or to engage  in other activities. After dark the resinous nuts of the _bitaog_ tree,  or leaf covered resin torches are burned, and by their uncertain light  the women and men carry on their labors until far into the night.  Entrance to the dwelling is gained by means of a notched log, bamboo  pole, or by a ladder of the same material. As a protection against  strong winds many props are placed against the sides of the house, and  when large trees are available the dwellings are further secured by  being anchored to them with rattan lines.    In each settlement or district will be found one large house built on  the same general plan as the smaller dwellings, but capable of housing  several hundred people (Plate XV). This is the home of the local _datu_  or ruler. All great ceremonies are held here, and it is the place to  which all hasten when danger threatens. It is the social center of the  community, and all who desire go there at any time and remain as long as  they wish, accepting meanwhile the food and hospitality of the ruler.    A brief description of the house of Datu Tongkaling will give a good  idea of this type of structure. Except for size--the dimensions being 44  x 20 ft.--the exterior does not differ greatly from the houses already  described. A long, partially covered porch leading to the doorway is  provided with benches which are always occupied by men and boys,  loitering or engaged in the absorbing task of lousing one another. At  the far end of the room is the elevated platform, but this one is much  wider than is customary, and is intended as the sleeping place for the  warriors, or illustrious guests. As the writer and his wife were  considered, by the _datu_, as belonging to the latter class, they were  favored with this vantage spot, from which they could view and be viewed  by the whole household. Along the sides of the room are elevated  box-like enclosures in which the _datu_ and some of his wives and  daughters sleep and keep their belongings. At night the balance of the  family, including men, women, children, and dogs, occupy the floor.  Midway between the side walls and near to the elevated platform are two  decorated bamboo poles, which are raised in honor of the patron spirits  of the warriors; while in other parts of the room are baskets, hanging  altars, and other devices in which are placed offerings intended for the  spirits. In addition to the customary furnishings are hundreds of  objects testifying to the wealth of the _datu_. Clothes, boxes, dozens  of huge copper gongs, drums, ancient Chinese jars and plates, spears and  shields, beaded clothing, baskets, and last but not least--in the  estimation of the _datu_--a huge enameled advertisement of an American  brewery.    In the western part of the Bagobo district is a village known as  Bansalan. Recently its people have been induced to leave the old  settlement and build in a new location, midway between the mountains and  the sea. Here the writer found a very different type of house (Plate  XVIa). Small trees formed the uprights to which cross-beams were tied to  make the roof supports, and on these rested a final covering of _nipa_  palm. A few feet above the ground other supports were lashed and on them  strips of _palma brava_ were laid as flooring. In the few cases where  the houses were fitted with sides, strips of _nipa_ palm fastened  together with rattan were used. There seemed to be no uniform type of  dwelling, each house differing from its neighbor in number of rooms,  floor levels, or in other respects. Only one feature, the elevated  sleeping platform at one end of the house, was always found. A few miles  further inland, in the old settlement, the houses are of the type  already described in detail. The people have been practically forced to  their new location by governmental action. The new careless type of  structures seen in Bansalan probably represents, to them, temporary  structures in which they expect to remain only until a change of  governors will furnish an excuse for returning to the old location.    OTHER BUILDINGS.    Near to each farm house or settlement will be seen one or more  granaries, in which rice is stored (Plate XIV). Four poles form the  support for a rectangular base from which the sides of the structure  slope out at an angle of about 25 degrees from the perpendicular until  they meet the roof. The sides and roof are of bamboo beaten flat, the  latter covered with a topping of straw.    In the hemp fields is an occasional shed where the fiber is sometimes  stripped, but more often these buildings, thus hidden from the public  gaze, house the forges on which the smiths fashion knives and spears, or  cast the bells and betel nut boxes so dear to the heart of each Bagobo.    Aside from the shrines or altars, which we shall describe later, the  Bagobo erects no other buildings. He sometimes encloses a rice or  cornfield with a fence, but this requires no special skill in building,  since it consists of two parallel lines of uprights, between which  bamboo tubes are laid to the desired height (Plate XVIb).    FOOD AND ITS PREPARATION.    It is impossible, without including about everything edible in a  vegetable line to be found in the district, to give a full list of  foods; hence no such attempt will be made. Chief of all is the rice,  many varieties of which are grown in the mountain-side clearings.[11]    [11] Back of the coast there are no irrigated fields to be found in the  Davao District.    Next in importance is the _camote_, or sweet potato, and then follow in  the order of their importance: corn, banana, sago and cocoanut.    Fish, eels, crabs, grasshoppers, monkeys,[12] deer, pigs, and chickens  form a part of the food supply; in fact, the people seem to draw the  line at nothing but crows, snakes, mice, rats, goats, horses, dogs, and  cats. Despite the assertion of a number of worthy informants that the  last three are on the prohibited list, it is the opinion of the writer  that it is the scarcity of the supply rather than any feeling of  prejudice which causes them to be included.    [12] Some people refuse to eat monkey meat.    Salt and pepper are used as condiments. The former is secured in trade  with the coast natives and Chinese, while the latter is produced by  mashing the fruit of a small wild pepper, locally known as _katombal_.    Rice, after being allowed to dry, is stored without being separated from  the straw. When a supply is needed a bundle is laid on a piece of hide  and is beaten with a wooden pestle, wielded by a woman or a slave. This  separates the grain, which is gathered up and placed in a wooden mortar,  where it is again beaten with the pestle until the outer husk has been  loosened. To remove the chaff the rice is taken from the mortar, placed  on a flat winnowing tray (Fig. 13), and tossed and caught, until the  wind has carried away the lighter husks, thus leaving the grain free.  This is placed in a pot, a small quantity of water is added, and the  vessel is placed over the fire. Here it is allowed to remain only until  it begins to boil, when it is placed on the ashes, near enough to the  fire to keep it hot. From time to time the woman turns the jar until the  contents is cooked through, wren each grain stands out free from its  fellows.[13]    [13] This is the usual way of preparing rice throughout the archipelago.    FIG. 13. RICE WINNOWER.    Other vegetable foods are eaten raw, or are cooked with water and salt,  with perhaps the addition of a little meat broth or a sour[sic].    [Transcriber's note: \"sour\" should read \"soup.\"]    Small birds and fish are cooked without other treatment than a hasty  cleaning; but the flesh of larger fowls, deer, and pig is generally cut  into small cubes and cooked with condiments in a jar or small Chinese  caldron. Birds are sometimes prepared by placing them on a spit,  covering them with green banana leaves, and suspending them above the  fire until roasted. This primitive paper bag cooking yields a most  excellent dish.    Grasshoppers are relished, and are secured in the following manner: A  clear grass spot is selected and several deep holes are dug in one end.  Back of them, and leading toward them, is a high tight fence made in a  V. By beating the grass with boughs as they walk toward the trap, the  people drive the grasshoppers before them until they are finally forced  into the pit, from which they are collected by the bushel.    I was told that meat was sometimes salted, dried, and stored away for  future use. The climate seems to be absolutely opposed to such  foresight, and the one time that I saw the process being used, the odors  were such that I beat a hasty retreat and chose to accept, without  proof, the verdict of the natives, that venison thus prepared was  excellent.    Of almost as much importance as food is the use of the betel or areca  nut,[14] which is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#5)"],[1," small troops to the open  ground, no sooner do they spy a man than they dart up the hillsides  and disappear in the darker valleys.    All observers testify to the prodigious volume of voice possessed by  these animals. According to the writer whom I have just cited, in one  of them, the Siamang, \"the voice is grave and penetrating, resembling  the sounds goek, goek, goek, goek, goek ha ha ha ha haaaaa, and may be  easily heard at a distance of half a league.\" While the cry is being  uttered, the great membranous bag under the throat which communicates  with the organ of voice, the so-called \"laryngeal sac,\" becomes  greatly distended, diminishing again when the creature relapses into  silence.    M. Duvaucel, likewise, affirms that the cry of the Siamang may be  heard for miles--making the woods ring again. So Mr. Martin describes  the cry of the agile Gibbon as \"overpowering and deafening\" in a room,  and \"from its strength, well calculated for resounding through the  vast forests.\" Mr. Waterhouse, an accomplished musician as well as  zooelogist, says, \"The Gibbon's voice is certainly much more powerful  than that of any singer I ever heard.\" And yet it is to be recollected  that this animal is not half the height of, and far less bulky in  proportion than, a man.    [Illustration: A GIBBON.]    There is good testimony that various species of Gibbon readily take to  the erect posture. Mr. George Bennett, a very excellent observer, in  describing the habits of a male _Hylobates syndactylus_ which remained  for some time in his possession, says: \"He invariably walks in the  erect posture when on a level surface; and then the arms either hang  down, enabling him to assist himself with his knuckles; or, what is  more usual, he keeps his arms uplifted in nearly an erect position,  with the hands pendent ready to seize a rope, and climb up on the  approach of danger or on the obtrusion of strangers. He walks rather  quick in the erect posture, but with a waddling gait, and is soon run  down if, while pursued, he has no opportunity of escaping by  climbing.... When he walks in the erect posture, he turns the leg and  foot outward, which occasions him to have a waddling gait and to seem  bow-legged.\"    Dr. Burrough states of another Gibbon, the Horlack or Hooluk:    \"They walk erect; and when placed on the floor, or in an open field,  balance themselves very prettily by raising their hands over their  head and slightly bending the arm at the wrist and elbow, and then run  tolerably fast, rocking from side to side; and, if urged to greater  speed, they let fall their hands to the ground, and assist themselves  forward, rather jumping than running, still keeping the body, however,  nearly erect.\"    Somewhat different evidence, however, is given by Dr. Winslow Lewis:    \"Their only manner of walking was on their posterior or inferior  extremities, the others being raised upward to preserve their  equilibrium, as rope-dancers are assisted by long poles at fairs.  Their progression was not by placing one foot before the other, but by  simultaneously using both, as in jumping.\" Dr. Salomon Mueller also  states that the Gibbons progress upon the ground by short series of  tottering jumps, effected only by the hind limbs, the body being held  altogether upright.    But Mr. Martin, who also speaks from direct observation, says of the  Gibbons generally:    \"Pre-eminently qualified for arboreal habits, and displaying among the  branches amazing activity, the Gibbons are not so awkward or  embarrassed on a level surface as might be imagined. They walk erect  with a waddling or unsteady gait, but at a quick pace, the equilibrium  of the body requiring to be kept up, either by touching the ground  with the knuckles, first on one side then on the other, or by  uplifting the arms so as to poise it. As with the Chimpanzee, the  whole of the narrow, long sole of the foot is placed upon the ground  at once, and raised at once, without any elasticity of step.\"    After this mass of concurrent and independent testimony, it cannot  reasonably be doubted that the Gibbons commonly and habitually assume  the erect attitude.    But level ground is not the place where these animals can display  their very remarkable and peculiar locomotive powers, and that  prodigious activity which almost tempts one to rank them among flying,  rather than among ordinary climbing mammals.    Mr. Martin has given so excellent and graphic an account of the  movements of a _Hylobates agilis_, living in the Zooelogical Gardens,  in 1840, that I will quote it in full:    \"It is almost impossible to convey in words an idea of the quickness  and graceful address of her movements: they may indeed be termed  aerial, as she seems merely to touch in her progress the branches  among which she exhibits her evolutions. In these feats her hands and  arms are the sole organs of locomotion, her body, hanging as if  suspended by a rope, sustained by one hand (the right, for example),  she launches herself, by an energetic movement, to a distant branch,  which she catches with the left hand; but her hold is less than  momentary; the impulse for the next launch is acquired; the branch  then aimed at is attained by the right hand again, and quitted  instantaneously, and so on, in alternate succession. In this manner  spaces of twelve and eighteen feet are cleared, with the greatest ease  and uninterruptedly, for hours together, without the slightest  appearance of fatigue being manifested; and it is evident that, if  more space could be allowed, distances very greatly exceeding eighteen  feet would be as easily cleared; so that Duvaucel's assertion that he  has seen these animals launch themselves from one branch to another,  forty feet asunder, startling as it is, may be well credited.  Sometimes, on seizing a branch in her progress, she will throw  herself, by the power of one arm only, completely round it, making a  revolution with such rapidity as almost to deceive the eye, and  continue her progress with undiminished velocity. It is singular to  observe how suddenly this Gibbon can stop, when the impetus giving by  the rapidity and distance of her swinging leaps would seem to require  a gradual abatement of her movements. In the very midst of her flight  a branch is seized, the body raised, and she is seen, as if by magic,  quietly seated on it, grasping it with her feet. As suddenly she again  throws herself into action.    \"The following facts will convey some notion of her dexterity and  quickness. A live bird was let loose in her apartment; she marked its  flight, made a long swing to a distant branch, caught the bird with  one hand in her passage, and attained the branch with her other hand,  her aim, both at the bird and at the branch, being as successful as if  one object only had engaged her attention. It may be added that she  instantly bit off the head of the bird, picked its feathers, and then  threw it down without attempting to eat it.    \"On another occasion this animal swung herself from a perch, across a  passage at least twelve feet wide, against a window which it was  thought would be immediately broken: but not so; to the surprise of  all, she caught the narrow framework between the panes with her hand,  in an instant attained the proper impetus, and sprang back again to  the cage she had left--a feat requiring not only great strength, but  the nicest precision.\"    The Gibbons appear to be naturally very gentle, but there is very good  evidence that they will bite severely when irritated, a female  _Hylobates agilis_ having so severely lacerated one man with her long  canines that he died; while she had injured others so much that, by  way of precaution, these formidable teeth had been filed down; but if  threatened she would still turn on her keeper. The Gibbons eat  insects, but appear generally to avoid animal food. A Siamang,  however, was seen by Mr. Bennett to seize and devour greedily a live  lizard. They commonly drink by dipping their fingers in the liquid and  then licking them. It is asserted that they sleep in a sitting  posture.    Duvaucel affirms that he has seen the females carry their young to the  water-side and there wash their faces, in spite of resistance and  cries. They are gentle and affectionate in captivity--full of tricks  and pettishness, like spoiled children, and yet not devoid of a  certain conscience, as an anecdote, told by Mr. Bennett will show. It  would appear that his Gibbon had a peculiar inclination for  disarranging things in the cabin. Among these articles a piece of soap  would especially attract his notice, and for the removal of this he  had been once or twice scolded. \"One morning,\" says Mr. Bennett, \"I  was writing, the Ape being present in the cabin, when, casting my eyes  toward him, I saw the little fellow taking the soap. I watched him  without him perceiving that I did so: and he occasionally would cast a  furtive glance toward the place where I sat. I pretended to write; he  seeing me busily occupied, took the soap, and moved away with it in  his paw. When he had walked half the length of the cabin, I spoke  quietly, without frightening him. The instant he found I saw him he  walked back again and deposited the soap nearly in the same place from  whence he had taken it. There was certainly something more than  instinct in that action: he evidently betrayed a consciousness of  having done wrong both by his first and last actions--and what is  reason if that is not an exercise of it?\"    The most elaborate account of the natural history of the Orang-Utan  extant is that given in the \"_Verhandelingen over de Natuurlijke  Geschiedenis der Nederlandsche overzeeche Bezittingen (1839-45)_,\" by  Dr. Salomon Mueller and Dr. Schlegel, and I shall base what I have to  say upon this subject almost entirely on their statements, adding here  and there particulars of interest from the writings of Brooke,  Wallace,"]]]
