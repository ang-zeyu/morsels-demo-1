He offered  no opposition to the deposition of King Richard II.: it was clearly  inevitable. Braybrooke was a vigorous reformer of abuses, and  denounced the profanation of the church by traffickers, shooting at  birds inside, and playing at ball.    Alongside the Lady Chapel, on the north side, was the chapel of St.  George. We will now pass from it back by the north aisle. By the  pillar north of the altar screen was the tomb of Sir Thomas Heneage.  He was Vice-Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth, and all his life was much  trusted by her in matters of foreign diplomacy, though he sometimes  got into trouble by taking too much on himself. His daughter Elizabeth  was ancestress of the Earls of Winchelsea. He died in 1595.    Opposite this, at the North Wall, was the tomb of Ralph Hengham (d.  1311). Like so many great lawyers of old time he was in Holy Orders,  Chancellor of the Diocese of Exeter, and also Chief Justice of the  King's Bench. He was sent to the Tower for falsifying a document,  which he is said to have done in order to reduce a fine imposed on  a poor man from 13_s._ 4_d._ to 6_s._ 8_d._, and was himself fined  heavily; the money being applied to building a clock tower in Palace  Yard, opposite the door of Westminster Hall. Two judges, on being  urged to tamper with records for beneficent purposes, are said to  have declared that they did not mean to build clock towers! He  was afterwards restored to office. He did good work in his day in  compiling a Digest of the law.    SIR SIMON BURLEY, K.G., tutor and adviser of Richard II., beheaded on  the charge of having corrupted the King's Court, 1388.

Hollar._]      St. Paul's, as we see, was rich in tombs of mediaeval bishops; as to  Royalty it could not be named as compared with Westminster Abbey, for  the City was not a royal residence except in very rare cases. But here  we come to two tombs of Kings. Sebba was buried in the North Aisle in  695. He had been King of the East Saxons, but being afflicted with  grievous sickness he became a monk. His tomb remained until the Great  Fire, as did that of Ethelred the Unready, next to it. On the arches  above were tablets containing the following inscriptions:--    \"Hic jacet Sebba Rex Orientalium Saxonum; qui conversus fuit ad fidem  per Erkenwaldum Londonensem Episcopum, anno Christi DCLXXVII. Vir  multum Deo devotus, actibus religiosis, crebris precibus & piis  elemosynarum fructibus plurimum intentus; vitam privatam & Monasticam  cunctis Regni divitiis & honoribus praeferens: Qui cum regnasset annos  XXX. habitum religiosum accepit per benedictionem Waltheri Londinensis  Antistitis, qui praefato Erkenwaldo successit. De quo Venerabilis Beda  in historia gentis Anglorum.\"[1]    \"Hic jacet Ethelredus Anglorum Rex, filius Edgari Regis; cui in die  consecrationis his, post impositam Coronam, fertur S. Dunstanus  Archiepiscopus dira praedixisse his verbis: Quoniam aspirasti ad regnum  per mortem fratris tui, in cujus sanguinem conspiraverunt Angli, cum  ignominiosa matre tua; non deficiet gladius de domo tua, saeviens in te  omnibus diebus vitae tuae; interficiens de semine tuo quousque Regnum  tuum transferatur in Regnum alienum, cujus ritum et linguam Gens cui  praesides non novit; nec expiabitur nisi longa vindicta peccatum tuum,  & peccatum matris tuae, & peccatum virorum qui interfuere consilio  illius nequam: Quae sicut a viro sancto praedicta evenerunt; nam  Ethelredus variis praeliis per Suanum Danorum Regem filiumque suum  Canutum fatigatus et fugatus, ac tandem Londoni arcta obsidione  conclusus, misere diem obiit Anno Dominicae Incarnationis MXVII.  postquam annis XXXVI. in magna tribulatione regnasset.\"[2]    Certainly in this latter terrible epitaph, it cannot be said that the  maxim _de mortuis_ was observed. But it speaks the truth.    Of a much later date is a royal monument, not indeed of a king, but of  the son and father of kings, namely, John of Gaunt. He died in 1399,  and his tomb in St. Paul's was as magnificent as those of his  father in the Confessor's Chapel at Westminster, and of his son at  Canterbury. It was indeed a Chantry founded by Henry IV. to the memory  of his father and mother, Gaunt and Blanche of Lancaster. She was  Gaunt's first wife (d. 1369), and bore him not only Henry IV., but  Philippa, who became wife of the King of Portugal, and Elizabeth, wife  of John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon. It was through Blanche that Gaunt  got his dukedom of Lancaster. She died of plague in 1369, during his  absence in the French Wars, and was buried here. Before his return  to England he had married (in 1371) Constance, daughter of Pedro  the Cruel, and hereby laid claim to the crown of Castile, as the  inscription on his monument recorded. Their daughter married Henry,  Prince of the Asturias, afterwards King of Castile. Constance died in  1394, and was also buried in St. Paul's, though her effigy was not on  the tomb. In January, 1396, he married Catharine Swynford, who had  already borne him children, afterwards legitimised. One of them was  the great Cardinal Beaufort; another, John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset,  was the grandfather of Margaret Tudor, mother of Henry VII. Gaunt's  third wife (d. 1403) is buried at Lincoln. The long inscription on the  monument closed with the words, \"Illustrissimus hic princeps Johannes  cognomento Plantagenet, Rex Castilliae et Legionis, Dux Lancastriae,  Comes Richmondiae, Leicestriae, Lincolniae et Derbiae, locum tenens  Aquitaniae, magnus Seneschallus Angliae, obiit anno XXII. regni regis  Ricardi secundi, annoque Domini MCCCXCIX.\"    Close by John of Gaunt, between the pillars of the 6th bay of the  Choir, was the tomb of WILLIAM HERBERT (1501-1569), first Earl of  Pembroke of the second creation, a harum-scarum youth, who settled  down into a clever politician, and was high in favour with Henry  VIII., who made him an executor of his will, and nominated him one of  the Council of twelve for Edward VI. He went through the reign of Mary  not without suspicion of disloyalty, but was allowed to hold his  place at Court, and in the reign of Queen Elizabeth he was accused  of favouring the Queen of Scots, though here also he overcame the  suspicions, and did not lose his place. He married Anne, the sister of  Queen Catherine Parr, and they were both buried in St. Paul's.    JOHN OF CHISHULL, who filled the see from 1274-1280, and was Edward  III.'s Chancellor, held a great number of valuable posts together.  This may have produced the mental incapacity into which he fell.  Archbishop Peckham had to appoint a commission to manage the diocese.  He was buried against the wall of the North Aisle, not far from John  of Gaunt.    ROGER NIGER, bishop from 1228 to 1241, was buried under the fifth  bay of the Choir, between it and the North Aisle. There were three  inscriptions on his tomb, the first on the aisle side:      \"Ecclesiae quondam Praesul praesentis, in anno    M bis C quater X jacet hic Rogerus humatus:    Hujus erat manibus Domino locus iste dicatus:    Christe, suis precibus veniam des; tolle reatus.\"    Then we have a short biography in laudatory terms, and below that a  record which one may translate as it stands: \"It came to pass while  this Bishop Roger stood mitred [infulatus] before the high altar,  ready to begin the Divine mysteries, there came on such a dense cloud  that men could scarcely discern one another; and presently a  fearful clap of thunder followed, and such a blaze of lightning and  intolerable smell, that all who stood by fled hastily, expecting  nothing less than death. The Bishop and one deacon only bravely  remained, and when the air was at length purified the Bishop completed  the service.\" We shall have more about this storm hereafter.    SIR JOHN MASON (1503-1566), the son of a cowherd at Abingdon, and  afterwards a great benefactor to that town. His mother was a sister to  the Abbot of Abingdon, and through this relationship he was educated  at Oxford, became a Fellow of All Souls', took orders, and, in  consequence of the skill which he displayed in diplomacy and  international law, received rich Church preferments, among them the  Deanery of Winchester. At the accession of Queen Mary he had to  relinquish this, but as he had been faithful to her, she showed him  much favour, and gave him some secular offices. On the accession of  Elizabeth, he returned to his Deanery, and was all his life one of  the most trusted of the Queen's councillors, especially in foreign  matters.    DR. WILLIAM AUBREY was appointed Vicar-General of Canterbury by  Archbishop Grindal, and was esteemed a great lawyer in his time. He  was the grandfather of the famous antiquary (d. 1595).    Crossing the Choir, and beginning from the west, we will now proceed  eastward along the South Aisle of the Choir. First, we come to two  famous Deans, Donne and Colet, the account of whom belongs to a  subsequent page. In fact, the greater number of monuments in this  aisle are of later date than the others, but it will be more  convenient to take them here, excepting those which are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16534"],[0,"A Young Folks' History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (#5)"],[1,"of Mormon) are true, so that you can say that you      heard me bear my testimony on my death-bed. God bless you all. My      trust is in Christ forever, worlds without end. Amen.\"    The world can not deny these three men's testimony. Though they left the  Church and in their darkness they opposed the prophet of the Lord, yet  never did they deny what the angel had shown them. On the same page that  the testimony of the three witnesses is recorded, you will also find the  names of eight others who testify to having seen the plates from which the  Book of Mormon was translated.    Topics.--1. The testimony of the three witnesses. 2. Martin Harris. 3.  Oliver Cowdery. 4. David Whitmer. 5. The eight witnesses.    Questions and Review.--1. Where is the testimony of the three witnesses  found? 2. What does that testimony say? 3. What other testimony is found in  the Book of Mormon? 4. How did the three get their testimony? 5. Tell of  Martin Harris. 6. Of Oliver Cowdery. 7. Of David Whitmer. 8. Name some  things that make their testimony strong. 9. Name the eight witnesses.          CHAPTER VII.    THE PRIESTHOOD RESTORED.      When Joseph and Oliver were engaged in translating the Book of Mormon they  came to a passage which told of baptism in water for the remission of sins.  This was not quite plain to them. They knew, of course, something of the  many kinds of baptism practiced by the various sects of the day, but if the  religions on the earth at that time were not accepted of the Lord as Joseph  had been told, none of the ministers would have a right to baptize;  besides, the passage in the Book of Mormon said that baptism was for the  remission of sins. The preachers did not teach it this way, though they  could read that it was taught in the same manner by the apostles in  Christ's time. (Acts 2:38.)    This right or authority to do things in the name of the Lord is called  Priesthood. The apostles and prophets of old had it, but where were they to  look for this power now?    So Joseph and Oliver on the 15th day of May, 1829, went into the woods to  ask the Lord about it. Their prayer was answered by an angel who told them  that his name was John, called John the Baptist, who had baptized Jesus in  the river Jordan. He said he had come to restore a portion of the holy  Priesthood, even that part which would give them power to baptize for the  remission of sins, but not to lay on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.  He promised them that if they were faithful this other power would be  given them later.    The angel then laid his hands on their heads and ordained them to the  Aaronic Priesthood. He told Joseph to baptize Oliver, after which Oliver  was to baptize Joseph. Then Joseph was to ordain Oliver and Oliver to do  the same to Joseph. All this they gladly did, and immediately they were  filled with great joy.    Thus was the power to baptize for the remission of sins again given to the  earth. Think what a great event it was! None in all the world had this  power, save two unknown young men in the woods of Pennsylvania. Great  things often have small beginnings. Now there are thousands who have this  blessed power, and no doubt the elder that baptized each of you can trace  his ordination which gave him the authority to do so back to Joseph or  Oliver and from them to John the baptist.    Sometime in June, 1829, the promise which John made to the young men was  fulfilled. The ancient apostles Peter, James, and John, who held the keys  of this higher power came to Joseph and Oliver and ordained them to the  Melchizedek Priesthood. This gave them the power to lay on hands for the  gift of the Holy Ghost, and also to go forth and administer in the  ordinances of the gospel.    Topics.--1. Priesthood. 2. Visit of John the Baptist. 3. Visit of Peter,  James, and John.    Questions and Review.--1. What led Joseph and Oliver to ask the Lord  about baptism? 2. What is baptism for? 3. How is it performed? 4. How did  Joseph and Oliver get the authority to baptize? 5. Who was John the  Baptist? 6. What is Priesthood? 7. Name the two grades of Priesthood. 8.  Who baptized you? 9. How did he get the authority to baptize? 10. Who were  Peter, James, and John? 11. What did they do? 12. Give the date of John's  visit.          CHAPTER VIII.    ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH.      By this time many people came to Joseph, some out of curiosity, some to be  taught of the wonderful truths which he had received, and some, I am sorry  to say, came to do him harm. As Joseph and Oliver now had power to baptize,  a number of those who believed were baptized by them.    The time had now come to organize the Church and the Lord revealed to  Joseph that it should be done on the 6th day of April, 1830. Accordingly on  that day six men who had been baptized met at the house of Peter Whitmer,  Sen., at Fayette, Seneca county, state of New York. Their names were Joseph  Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Hyrum Smith, Peter Whitmer, Jr., Samuel H. Smith,  and David Whitmer.    Joseph tells us what was done at this meeting as follows:    \"Having opened the meeting by solemn prayer to our Heavenly Father, we  proceeded to call on our brethren to know whether they accepted us as their  teachers in the things of the kingdom of God and whether they were  satisfied that we should proceed and be organized as a Church according to  the commandments we had received. To this they all consented. I then laid  my hands upon Oliver Cowdery and ordained him an elder of the Church of  Jesus Christ; after which he ordained me also to the office of an elder of  said Church. We then took bread, blessed it, and broke it with them; also  wine, blessed it, and drank it with them. We then laid our hands on each  member of the Church present, that they might receive the gift of the Holy  Ghost and be confirmed members of the Church of Christ. The Holy Ghost was  poured out upon us to a very great degree--some prophesied, whilst we all  praised the Lord and rejoiced exceedingly.\"    Thus was the true Church of Christ again on the earth. During the hundreds  of years when the world had lain in darkness, not a man could have been  found who had the authority to confirm a member of the church; but now  there was a beginning, a very small beginning it is true, but the promise  is that it will grow and increase until it shall fill the whole earth.    The first public meeting after the Church was organized was held five days  later at the same place. At this meeting Oliver Cowdery preached the first  public discourse. He explained the principles of the gospel, and quite a  number believed and were baptized.    Shortly after this time Joseph went to a town called Colesville, in Broome  county, N.Y., not far from Pennsylvania to visit his friend Joseph Knight  who had aided him when he was at work on the Book of Mormon. Joseph held a  number of meetings in this place and made some friends. Among those who  attended these meetings was Newel Knight, son of Joseph Knight. This young  man had many talks with Joseph about the gospel, but still he kept putting  off doing his duty in being baptized. Because of this the evil one got  power over him and treated him so badly that the prophet was sent for. When  Joseph arrived he found his friend Newel acting strangely. His face and  body twisted in an awful manner and at last he was actually caught up from  the floor and tossed about. Many of the neighbors now came in, but they  could do nothing to help the suffering man.    [Illustration: Map of Fayette and Kirtland]    When Joseph managed to get hold of Newel's hand, he became still and spoke  to Joseph, asking him to cast the devil from him.    \"If you know that I can, it shall be done,\" replied Joseph, whereupon he  commanded the evil one in the name of Jesus Christ to depart. Newel became  all right again at once, and was greatly blessed by the Spirit of God. The  people present wondered greatly at what they had seen, and many of them  afterwards joined the Church.    This was the first miracle performed in the Church. Jesus had said to his  apostles in his day: \"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. * *  * And these signs shall follow them that believe: in my name shall they  cast out devils,\" etc. Thus we see the same signs following the believer in  our day the same as in the days of the first apostles.    On the first of June, 1830, the first conference, of the Church was held in  Fayette. There were about thirty members present besides many others who  came to hear. The Spirit of God was greatly enjoyed at this meeting. Many  prophesied, while others had beautiful visions of the heavens opened to  their eyes.    Topics.--1. Organization of the Church. 2. First meeting, sermon and  conference. 3. First miracle.    Questions and Review.--1. When and where was the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints organized? 2. Name the first six members. 3. What was  done at that meeting? 4. How many members are there in the Church today? 5.  How did you become a member of the Church? 6. Describe the first miracle.  7. How was the evil one cast out in former days? (See Acts 16: 16, 18.) 8.  What proof was given that Joseph and his brethren were true believers. (See  Mark 16: 16, 17.) 9. When was the first conference of the Church held?          CHAPTER IX.    PERSECUTION OF JOSEPH.      By this time you will see that when the Lord set his hand to begin the  great latter-day work, the evil one was also present, trying to hinder its  progress. At the very beginning there were only Joseph and a few friends to  work against, but now the Church was fast becoming established in the land,  and if it were to be stopped some strong effort would have to be made. So  the evil one inspired men to gather in large crowds or mobs to annoy and do  harm to the members of the Church and their friends.    Shortly after the conference mentioned in the last chapter, Joseph and a  number of "]]]
