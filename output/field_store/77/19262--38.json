Writing from a large city the heading should contain the street and  number. Your correspondent, in directing his answer will rely on the  address given in the heading of your letter. Never be guilty of the  blunder committed by ignorant persons of placing a part of the heading  under the signature.    [Illustration:          765 Market Street,           Philadelphia, June 10, 1882.]    [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF THE STRUCTURE OF A LETTER.]    The second line of the heading should begin a little farther to the  right than the first line, as seen above.    If the writer has a box at the Post Office and wishes his mail  delivered there, he may head his letter, as on the following page:    [Illustration:          P.O. Box 3657,            New York, May 16, 1882.]      [Illustration:          Chas. A Roberts                Wm. J. Dennis                       Office of                     ROBERT & DENNIS              DEALERS IN FANCY AND STAPLE GROCERIES,                   320 Jefferson Street,               Burlington, Va.,______________ 18____]    Writing from the principal cities of the United States it is not  necessary to make the name of the state a part of the heading, as that  is supposed to be known and understood, but with smaller cities the  name of the state also, should be given. Thus, there is a Quincy  in Illinois, and also in Massachusetts, and unless the state were  mentioned a person answering a letter from Quincy, would not know  which state to direct his reply to. In writing from an obscure town or  village, not only the state should be given, but the county as well.    [Illustration:          Ottawa, La Salle County, Ill.,            December 20, 1882.]    The punctuation of the heading and other parts of the letter, is  of great importance in the estimation of cultivated persons, and  something which can be learned by a little attention on the part of  anyone, in examining the forms here given.      MARGIN.    A margin three-quarters of an inch in width should be left, on the  side of the letter, as shown in the diagram. This is convenient for  any mark or memorandum which your correspondent may desire to make  concerning anything contained in the letter, but its greater value  lies in the open, airy, and cheerful dress which it imparts to the  letter. A margin too narrow conveys the idea of stinginess, as if to  economize paper, while an irregular or zigzag margin conveys the idea  of carelessness or want of precision. On a sheet of note paper the  margin may be only one-half inch in width, thus making its width  proportionate to the size of the sheet.      ADDRESS.    On the next line below the heading, that is the third line from the  top of the sheet, and beginning at the left margin, should be placed  the _Address_, which consists of the name of the person to whom the  letter is written, together with his titles, if any, and his place of  residence or business. The letter is not complete without all this, in  the estimation of the business man. It does not fully explain itself,  if the place of residence is not down as well as the name, and in  preserving a letter press copy, this is quite essential for future  reference.    [Illustration:          Messrs. Samuel Bliss Co.            Reading, Pa.          Gentlemen:]    Or if the letter is written to a person living or doing business in a  large city, thus:    [Illustration:          Mr. James M. Cummings          645 Broadway, new York.            Sir:]    The names and residence should not be allowed to extend further to the  right than about the center of the sheet, thus leaving an open space  between this and the heading of your letter. In case the names or  place of residence should be so long as to require it, they may be  placed thus:    [Illustration:          Messrs. Richards, Shaw, Fitch            & Winslow, Chicago.          Gentlemen:]    The words _Dear Sir_ or _Gentlemen_ are sometimes placed farther to  the left, as in the above example, but most business men in their  correspondence place this complimentary address with reference to  the words above them, about three-quarters of an inch farther to the  right, as shown below.    [Illustration:          William D. Nelsen, Esq.,          177 Erie St., Boston,            Dear Sir:]    The custom of placing the address beneath the body instead of at the  beginning of the letter, is not much in vogue in business circles  in this country, most business men preferring to place the name and  address at the head of the sheet, and then write at it as if they were  talking to the person himself. When, however, the address is placed  below the letter it should occupy the same position as to the margin,  etc., as if placed at the beginning. The custom is borrowed from the  English, and its use is confined mostly to government officials and  professional men.      BODY OF THE LETTER.    This constitutes the written message. It should begin on the same line  with the words _Dear Sir_, or _Gentlemen_ leaving after these words a  small space. In case the place of residence or business is not written  in the address, then the complimentary address of _Dear Sir_ or  _Gentlemen_ will be placed on the next line under the name, or fourth  line from the top of the sheet, and the letter will begin on the fifth  line from the top, thus:    [Illustration:          Mr. Henry L. Dunham,          Dear Sir:              In answer to your esteemed favor]    Sometimes for the sake of convenience, and the saving of time and  labor, the letter head has printed in the left corner, above the  address, a blank form of memorandum as follows:    [Illustration:          Referring to        yours of...          OR,            In reply to        your favor of...,]    and after this introduction the writer is able speedily to get at the  marrow of his letter, without acknowledging the receipt of a former  communication.    The body of the letter should be divided into as many paragraphs as  there are distinct subjects in the letter, or a new paragraph should  be commenced at every change of the subject. The habit which some  persons have of tacking one subject to the end of another, and thus  making a letter one continuous paragraph of mixed up information,  instructions and requests, is extremely objectionable. It destroys the  force of what is said, instead of fixing each thought clearly on the  mind of the reader; it leaves him confused, and he reads a second time  and tries to get his ideas fixed and systematized, or he throws aside  the letter until he has more time in which to study it and get the  meaning clear.    If the letter is long and is really concerning only one subject, then  it may properly be divided into paragraphs by separating the different  divisions of the subject, and giving a paragraph to each. These should  be arranged in their logical order. Wherever the letter is to contain  numerous paragraphs to avoid omitting any of the items, it is best to  jot them down on a slip of paper, then embody them in the letter in  their natural order.    The first word of each paragraph should be indented, or moved in from  the margin, usually about the width of the margin. Thus if the margin  is three-fourths of an inch in width, the paragraph should begin  three-fourths of an inch from the margin. Some writers, however,  prefer to commence the first word of the paragraph an inch from the  margin, and it is really not so essential what the distance is, as  that it should be uniform, and all the paragraphs begin alike. A  little attention is necessary here. In ordering goods make each  article a separate paragraph.      COMPLIMENTARY CLOSING AND SIGNATURE.    The complimentary closing consists of such words as _Yours truly_,  _Respectfully_, etc., and should be placed on the next line beneath  the last one occupied by the body of the letter, commencing a little  to the right of the middle. The signature should be placed underneath  the words of respect, and begin still a little farther to the right.  Thus the conclusion of the letter will correspond in position and  arrangement with the heading.    [Illustration:          Yours truly,          John Maynard.]    The language of the complimentary closing should be governed by  the relation between the parties, and should correspond with the  complimentary address. The first letter between strangers should  commence with _Sir_ and end with the word _Respectfully_. After the  exchange of a few letters and a sort of business acquaintance may be  said to exist between the correspondents, then _Dear Sir_, and _Yours  truly_, may properly be introduced. A little more cordial would be  such a conclusion as the following:    [Illustration:          Yours very truly,          Rinold, Constable & Co.]    The man of business is apt, however, to have one stereotyped beginning  and ending to all his letters, and seldom stops to discriminate  between strangers and old customers in this respect. Often the  conclusion may be connected to the closing paragraph with perfect  grace and ease thus:    [Illustration:            Hoping to receive the goods without delay,        I remain,                      Respectfully,                        Henry P. Bowen.]    In the signature of a letter, especial care should be exercised.  Bear in mind that names of persons are not governed by the rules of  spelling, and words which precede or follow, proper names will not aid  us in deciphering them if they are poorly written.

They might consider it  more prudent to attempt to allay your distress by persuading you that  what you have seen has no objective reality, but is merely the phantasm  of an excited imagination; that if you had not been in love, had not sat  up all night, and had not thus overtaxed your physical powers, you would  have seen no vision. I shall not argue thus, for I am as certainly  convinced as of the fact that we sit here, that on all the nights when  we have played this suite called the 'Areopagita,' there has been some  one listening to us, and that you have at length been fortunate or  unfortunate enough to see him.\"    \"Do not say fortunate,\" said my brother; \"for I feel as though I shall  never recover from last night's shock.\"    \"That is likely enough,\" Mr. Gaskell answered, coolly; \"for as in the  history of the race or individual, increased culture and a finer mental  susceptibility necessarily impair the brute courage and powers of  endurance which we note in savages, so any supernatural vision such  as you have seen must be purchased at the cost of physical reaction.  From the first evening that we played this music, and heard the noises  mimicking so closely the sitting down and rising up of some person, I  have felt convinced that causes other than those which we usually call  natural were at work, and that we were very near the manifestation of  some extraordinary phenomenon.\"    \"I do not quite apprehend your meaning.\"    \"I mean this,\" he continued, \"that this man or spirit of a man has been  sitting here night after night, and that we have not been able to see  him, because our minds are dull and obtuse. Last night the elevating  force of a strong passion, such as that which you have confided to me,  combined with the power of fine music, so exalted your mind that you  became endowed, as it were, with a sixth sense, and suddenly were  enabled to see that which had previously been invisible. To this sixth  sense music gives, I believe, the key. We are at present only on the  threshold of such a knowledge of that art as will enable us to use it  eventually as the greatest of all humanising and educational agents.  Music will prove a ladder to the loftier regions of thought; indeed I  have long found for myself that I cannot attain to the highest range of  my intellectual power except when hearing good music. All poets, and  most writers of prose, will say that their thought is never so exalted,  their sense of beauty and proportion never so just, as when they are  listening either to the artificial music made by man, or to some of the  grander tones of nature, such as the roar of a western ocean, or the  sighing of wind in a clump of firs. Though I have often felt on such  occasions on the very verge of some high mental discovery, and though  a hand has been stretched forward as it were to rend the veil, yet it  has never been vouchsafed me to see behind it. This you no doubt were  allowed in a measure to do last night. You probably played the music  with a deeper intuition than usual, and this, combined with the  excitement under which you were already labouring, raised you for a  moment to the required pitch of mental exaltation.\"    \"It is true,\" John said, \"that I never felt the melody so deeply as when  I played it last night.\"    \"Just so,\" answered his friend; \"and there is probably some link between  this air and the history of the man whom you saw last night; some fatal  power in it which enables it to exert an attraction on him even after  death. For we must remember that the influence of music, though always  powerful, is not always for good. We can scarcely doubt that as certain  forms of music tend to raise us above the sensuality of the animal, or  the more degrading passion of material gain, and to transport us into  the ether of higher thought, so other forms are directly calculated to  awaken in us luxurious emotions, and to whet those sensual appetites  which it is the business of a philosopher not indeed to annihilate or to  be ashamed of, but to keep rigidly in check. This possibility of music  to effect evil as well as good I have seen recognised, and very aptly  expressed in some beautiful verses by Mr. Keble which I have just  read:--      \"'Cease, stranger, cease those witching notes,        The art of syren choirs;      Hush the seductive voice that floats        Across the trembling wires.      \"'Music's ethereal power was given        Not to dissolve our clay,      But draw Promethean beams from heaven        To purge the dross away.'\"      \"They are fine lines,\" said my brother, \"but I do not see how you apply  your argument to the present instance.\"    \"I mean,\" Mr. Gaskell answered, \"that I have little doubt that the  melody of this _Gagliarda_ has been connected in some manner with the  life of the man you saw last night. It is not unlikely, either, that it  was a favourite air of his whilst in the flesh, or even that it was  played by himself or others at the moment of some crisis in his history.  It is possible that such connection may be due merely to the innocent  pleasure the melody gave him in life; but the nature of the music  itself, and a peculiar effect it has upon my own thoughts, induce me to  believe that it was associated with some occasion when he either fell  into great sin or when some evil fate, perhaps even death itself,  overtook him. You will remember I have told you that this air calls up  to my mind a certain scene of Italian revelry in which an Englishman  takes part. It is true that I have never been able to fix his features  in my mind, nor even to say exactly how he was dressed. Yet now some  instinct tells me that it is this very man whom you saw last night. It  is not for us to attempt to pierce the mystery which veils from our eyes  the secrets of an after-death existence; but I can scarcely suppose that  a spirit entirely at rest would feel so deeply the power of a certain  melody as to be called back by it to his old haunts like a dog by his  master's whistle. It is more probable that there is some evil history  connected with the matter, and this, I think, we ought to consider if it  be possible to unravel.\"    My brother assenting, he continued, \"When this man left you, Johnnie,  did he walk to the door?\"    \"No; he made for the side wall, and when he reached the end of the  bookcase I lost sight of him.\"    Mr. Gaskell went to the bookcase and looked for a moment at the titles  of the books, as though expecting to see something in them to assist  his inquiries; but finding apparently no clue, he said--    \"This is the last time we shall meet for three months or more; let us  play the _Gagliarda_ and see if there be any response.\"    My brother at first would not hear of this, showing a lively dread of  challenging any reappearance of the figure he had seen: indeed he felt  that such an event would probably fling him into a state of serious  physical disorder. Mr. Gaskell, however, continued to press him,  assuring him that the fact of his now being no longer alone should  largely allay any fear on his part, and urging that this would be the  last opportunity they would have of playing together for some months.    At last, being overborne, my brother took his violin, and Mr. Gaskell  seated himself at the pianoforte. John was very agitated, and as he  commenced the _Gagliarda_ his hands trembled so that he could scarcely  play the air. Mr. Gaskell also exhibited some nervousness, not  performing with his customary correctness. But for the first time the  charm failed: no noise accompanied the music, nor did anything of an  unusual character occur. They repeated the whole suite, but with a  similar result.    Both were surprised, but neither, had any explanation to offer. My  brother, who at first dreaded intensely a repetition of the vision, was  now almost disappointed that nothing had occurred; so quickly does the  mood of man change.    After some further conversation the young men parted for the Long  Vacation--John returning to Worth Maltravers and Mr. Gaskell going to  London, where he was to pass a few days before he proceeded to his home  in Westmorland.          CHAPTER V      John spent nearly the whole of this summer vacation at Worth Maltravers.  He had been anxious to pay a visit to Royston; but the continued and  serious illness of Mrs. Temple's sister had called her and Constance to  Scotland, where they remained until the death of their relative allowed  them to return to Derbyshire in the late autumn. John and I had been  brought up together from childhood. When he was at Eton we had always  spent the holidays at Worth, and after my dear mother's death, when we  were left quite alone, the bonds of our love were naturally drawn still  closer. Even after my brother went to Oxford, at a time when most young  men are anxious to enjoy a new-found liberty, and to travel or to visit  friends in their vacation, John's ardent affection for me and for Worth  Maltravers kept him at home; and he was pleased on most occasions to  make me the partner of his thoughts and of his pleasures. This long  vacation of 1842 was, I think, the happiest of our lives. In my case I  know it was so, and I think it was happy also for him; for none could  guess that the small cloud seen in the distance like a man's hand was  afterwards to rise and darken all his later days. It was a summer of  brilliant and continued sunshine; many of the old people said that they  could never recollect so fine a season, and both fruit and crops were  alike abundant. John hired a small cutter-yacht, the _Palestine_, which  he kept in our little harbour of Encombe, and in which he and I made  many excursions, visiting Weymouth, Lyme Regis, and other places of  interest on the south coast.    In this summer my brother confided to me two secrets,--his love  for Constance Temple, which indeed was after all no secret, and the  history of "]]]
