I was told  that the brownish red represented the dog's animal instincts, the pearly  white his animal innocence, and the sapphire blue his devotional  instinct, in his case directed to me as his deity. Whether any of your  readers have had similar experiences and explain them similarly, I do  not know.    I had to go abroad one summer and my dog was ill with eczema, and as I  did not very much trust the maid I was leaving in charge, I sent him to  the vet's to be treated. As soon as I reached my destination I wrote to  a friend to go and inquire how he was. She replied that the dog was  perfectly miserable, and that he had an enormous wound on his back, that  he had eaten nothing for a week, that he was too weak to stand, and that  if he were hers, she would have him put out of his misery at once. I  wrote at once to the vet, telling him to telegraph \"Curable\" or  \"Hopeless,\" and to act accordingly. Meanwhile, I sat that afternoon in  the Buergerpark by myself and imagined the dog upon my lap, and myself  stroking and healing him. After this I found myself fully believing that  he would get better. The telegram I received was \"Curable,\" and my  friend wrote a second letter and said it was a miracle, for the dog was  quite convalescent. He recovered perfectly. Here, again, however, it may  have been that he was breaking his heart for a friend, and that my  friend's visit cheered him. Or may not both causes have had their  effect?                        \"AMBROSE ZAIL MARTYN.\"    Here is another case in the veracity of which I have every confidence. I  will call it      _The Headless Cat of No. ---- Lower Seedley Road, Seedley, Manchester_    It was related to me by Mr. Robert Dane, who was at one time a tenant of  No. ---- Lower Seedley Road, Seedley. I quote it as nearly as possible  in his words, thus:--    \"When we--my wife and I--took No. ---- Lower Seedley Road, no  possibility of the place being haunted crossed our minds. Indeed ghosts  were the very last things we reckoned on, as neither of us had the  slightest belief in them. Like the generality of solicitors, I am stodgy  and unimaginative, whilst my wife is the most practical and  matter-of-fact little woman you would meet in a day's march. Nor was  there anything about the house that in any way suggested the  superphysical. It was airy and light--no dark corners nor sinister  staircases--and equipped throughout with all modern conveniences. We  began our lease in June--the hottest June I remember--and nothing  occurred to disturb us till October.    \"It happened then in this wise. I will quote from my diary:--    \"_Monday, October 11th_.--Dick--that is my brother-in-law--and I, at 11  p.m., were sitting smoking and chatting together in the study. All the  rest of the household had gone to bed. We had no light in the room--as  Dick had a headache--save the fire, and that had burned so low that its  feeble glimmering scarcely enabled us to see each other's face. After a  space of sudden and thoughtful silence, Dick took the stump of a cigar  from his lips and threw it in the grate, where for a few moments it lay  glowing in the gloom.    \"'Jack,' he said, 'you will think me mad, but there is something deuced  queer about this room to-night--something in the atmosphere I cannot  define, but which I have never felt here--or indeed anywhere--before.  Look at that cigar-end--look!'    \"I did so, and received a shock. What I saw was certainly not the stump  Dick had had in his mouth, but an eye--a large, red and lurid eye--that  looked up at us with an expression of the utmost hate.    \"Dick raised the shovel and struck at it, but without effect--it still  glared at us. A great horror then seized us, and unable to remove our  gaze from the hellish thing, we sat glued to our chairs staring at it.  This state of affairs lasted till the clock in the hall outside struck  twelve, when the eye suddenly vanished, and we both felt as if some  intensely evil influence had been suddenly removed.    \"Dick did not like the idea of sleeping alone, and asked if he might  keep the electric light on in his room all night. Tremendous  extravagance, but under the circumstances excusable. I confess I  devoutly wished it was morning.    \"_Tuesday, October 12th._--I was awakened at 11.30 p.m. by Delia saying  to me, 'Oh, Edward, there have been such dreadful noises on the landing,  just as if a cat were being worried to death by dogs. Hark! there it is  again.' And as she spoke, from apparently just outside the door, came a  series of loud screeches, accompanied by savage growls and snarls.    \"Not knowing what to make of it, as we had no animals of our own in the  house, but concluding that a door or window having been left open, a dog  and cat had got in from outside, I lit a candle, and opened the bedroom  door. Instantly the sounds ceased and there was dead silence, and  although I searched everywhere, not a vestige of any animal was to be  seen. Moreover all the doors leading into the garden were shut and  locked, and the windows closed. Not wishing to frighten Delia, I  laughingly assured her the cat--a black Tom--was all right, that it was  sitting on the roof of the summer-house, looking none the worse for its  treatment, and that I had sent the dog--a terrier--flying out of the  gate with a well-deserved kick. I explained it was my fault about the  front door being left open--my brain had been a bit overstrained through  excessive work--and asked her on no account to blame the servants. I  grow alarmed at times when I realize how easy lawyering makes lying.    \"_Friday, October 21st._--On my way to bed last night I encountered a  rush of icy cold air at the first bend of the staircase. The candle  flared up, a bright blue flame, and went out. Something--an animal of  sorts--came tearing down the stairs past me, and on peering over the  banisters, I saw, looking up at me from the well of darkness beneath,  two big red eyes, the counterparts of the one Dick and I had seen on  October 11th. I threw a matchbox at them, but without effect. It was  only when I switched on the electric light that they disappeared. I  searched the house most carefully, but there were no signs of any  animal. Joined Delia, feeling nervous and henpecky.    \"_Monday, November 7th._--Tom and Mable came running into Delia's room  in a great state of excitement after tea to-day. 'Mother!' they cried,  'Mother! Do come! Some horrid dog has got a cat in the spare room and is  tearing it to pieces.' Delia, who was mending my socks at the time,  flung them anywhere, and springing to her feet, flew to the spare room.  The door was shut, but proceeding from within was the most appalling  pandemonium of screeches and snarls, just as if some dog had got hold of  a cat by the neck and was shaking it to death. Delia swung open the door  and rushed in. The room was empty--not a trace of a cat or dog  anywhere--and the sounds ceased! On my return home Delia met me in the  garden. 'Jack!' she said, 'I have probed the mystery at last. The house  is haunted! We must leave.'    \"_Saturday, November 12th._--Sublet house to James Barstow, retired oil  merchant, to-day. He comes in on the 30th. Hope he'll like it!    \"_Tuesday, November 15th._--Cook left to-day. 'I've no fault to find  with you, mum,' she condescendingly explained to Delia. 'It's not you,  nor the children, nor the food. It's the noises at night--screeches  outside my door, which sound like a cat, but which I know can't be a  cat, as there is no cat in the house. This morning, mum, shortly after  the clock struck two, things came to a climax. Hearing something in the  corner and wondering if it was a mouse--I ain't a bit afraid of mice,  mum--I sat up in bed and was getting ready to strike a light--the  matchbox was in my hand--when something heavy sprang right on the top of  me and gave a loud growl in my ear. That finished me, mum--I fainted.  When I came to myself, I was too frightened to stir, but lay with my  head under the blankets till it was time to get up. I then searched  everywhere, but there was no sign of any dog, and as the door was locked  there was no possibility of any dog having got in during the night. Mum,  I wouldn't go through what I suffered again for fifty pounds; I've got  palpitations even now; and I would rather go without my month's wages  than sleep in that room another night.' Delia paid her up to date, and  she went directly after tea.    \"_Friday, November 18th._--As I was coming out of the bathroom at 11  p.m. something fell into the bath with a loud splash. I turned to see  what it was--there was nothing there. I ran up the stairs to bed, three  steps at a time!    \"_Sunday, November 20th._--Went to church in the morning and heard the  usual Oxford drawl. On the way back I was pondering over the sermon and  wishing I could contort the Law as successfully as parsons contort the  Scriptures, when Dot--she is six to-day--came running up to me with a  very scared expression in her eyes. 'Father,' she cried, plucking me by  the sleeve, 'do hurry up. Mother is very ill.' Full of dreadful  anticipations, I tore home, and on arriving found Delia lying on the  sofa in a violent fit of hysterics. It was fully an hour before she  recovered sufficiently to tell me what had happened. Her account runs  thus:--    \"'After you went to church,' she began, 'I made the custard pudding,  jelly and blancmange for dinner, heard the children their collects, and  had just sat down with the intention of writing a letter to mother, when  I heard a very pathetic mew coming, so I thought, from under the sofa.  Thinking it was some stray cat that had got in through one of the  windows, I tried to entice it out, by calling \"Puss, puss,\" and making  the usual silly noise people do on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18236"],[0,"In de Amsterdamsche Jodenbuurt (#5)"],[1,"hoe smakelijk is niet de kuggel geweest;  glanzend en vet bolden zijn bruine wangen. Men zal smullen!    Zoo wordt de Sabbath in de strengste rust gevierd--en toch heeft men  zich aan kokend heete spijzen te goed kunnen doen. Groote uitvinder  van den Schalet! uw roem dure in eeuwigheid!        Een ander genot, dat de Sabbath-namiddag schenkt, is het Sabbathvieren  op straat. Niet alle bewoners van de Jodenbuurten blijven na afloop  van het middagmaal in het stille huisvertrek achter slot en grendel het  vallen van den nacht, daarmee het einde van den rustdag, afwachten. Het  meerendeel wandelt er uit.    En ziet ze wandelen, pronken in pracht van hun Sabbathkleeren! hoe de  Kalverstraat, de café-straten, de drukke pleinen door hen overbevolkt  worden!    Maar in de Jodenbuurten zelf is het niet minder druk van opgedirkte  Sabbathvierders. Alles leeft dan weer op de straat. Daar spelen de  kinderen \"begouretje\" met groote noten; daar zitten Koppel en Jachet  voor de deur en kijken naar de passage; daar wandelen de jongens en  meisjes en maken \"chijntjes\", slenteren joodsch-deftig de ouderen en  spreken over alles, behalve vandaag over \"massel\".    Het eind van de Sabbathviering wordt voorafgegaan door de \"Habdala\",  dus genoemd naar de slotwoorden der uit te spreken lofzegging,  waarin God wordt geprezen, die den Sabbath boven de werkdagen heeft  onderscheiden.    De plechtigheid geschiedt weer binnenskamers. Welk een contrast  echter biedt dit huisvertrek met dat, waarin de Vrijdagavond gevierd  werd! alles is nu in half-duister gehuld; slechts twee lichtjes, aan de  Sabbathlamp ontstoken, verspreiden een spaarzaam licht; het tafellaken  is reeds grootendeels weggeschoven, nog een klein deel van de tafel  is gedekt--beeld van den Sabbath, die zoo aanstonds verdwenen zal zijn.    De huisvader vult den beker tot over den rand met wijn--symbool van  overvloed en zegen; dit is de dronk ten afscheid. En daarbij neuriet  hij in het oud naïef Joodsch-Duitsch het Habdala-lied:    \"God van Abraham, Izak en Jacob! behoedt Uw volk Israël in Uwe  almacht; deze week moge komen tot geluk, tot zegen en alle heil; de  lieve heilige Sabbath gaat daarheen, de week moge komen tot geluk,  tot zegen en goed gewin, Amen, Sela!\"    En met de nieuw-aangebroken week eindigt hun Sabbath-bekoring, begint  weer in de Jodenbuurt de werkelijkheid....
