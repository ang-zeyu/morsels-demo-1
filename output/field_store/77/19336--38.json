Here and there appeared one of those beings, who like the owl hide  themselves by day, and are visible only in the dusk. Many of  them appeared to belong to the other world. Poor, puny, ragged,  sickly-looking creatures, that seemed as though they had been suckled  and reared with gin. \"How different,\" thought the Yorkshireman to  himself, \"to the fine, stout, active labourer one meets at an early hour  on a hunting morning in the country!\" His reverie was interrupted on  arriving opposite the _Morning Chronicle_ office, by the most discordant  yells that ever issued from human beings, and on examining the quarter  from whence they proceeded, a group of fifty or a hundred boys, or  rather little old men, were seen with newspapers in their hands and  under their arms, in all the activity of speculation and exchange. \"A  clean _Post_ for Tuesday's _Times_!\" bellowed one. \"I want the _Hurl_!  (Herald) for the _Satirist_!\" shouted another. \"Bell's _Life_ for the  _Bull_! _The Spectator_ for the _Sunday Times_!\"    The approach of our sportsmen was the signal for a change of the chorus,  and immediately Jorrocks was assailed with \"A hunter! a hunter! crikey,  a hunter! My eyes! there's a gamecock for you! Vot a beauty! Vere do you  turn out to-day? Vere's the stag? Don't tumble off, old boy! 'Ave you  got ever a rope in your pocket? Take Bell's _Life in London_, vot  contains all the sporting news of the country! Vot a vip the gemman's  got! Vot a precious basternadering he could give us--my eyes, vot a  swell!--vot a shocking bad hat!_[8]--vot shocking bad breeches!\"    [Footnote 8: \"Vot a shocking bad hat!\"--a slang cockney phrase of 1831.]    The fog, which became denser at every step, by the time they reached St.  Clement's Danes rendered their further progress almost impossible.--\"Oh,  dear! oh, dear! how unlucky,\" exclaimed Jorrocks, \"I would have given  twenty pounds of best Twankay for a fine day--and see what a thing we've  got! Hold my 'oss,\" said he to the Yorkshireman, \"while I run into the  'Angel,' and borrow an argand burner, or we shall be endorsed[9] to a  dead certainty.\" Off he got, and ran to the inn. Presently he emerged  from the yard--followed by horse-keepers, coach-washers, porters, cads,  waiters and others, amid loud cries of \"Flare up, flare up, old cock!  talliho fox-hunter!\"--with a bright mail-coach footboard lamp, strapped  to his middle, which, lighting up the whole of his broad back now cased  in scarlet, gave him the appearance of a gigantic red-and-gold insurance  office badge, or an elderly cherub without wings.    [Footnote 9: City--for having a pole run into one's rear.]    The hackney-coach-and cab-men, along whose lines they passed, could not  make him out at all. Some thought he was a mail-coach guard riding  post with the bags; but as the light was pretty strong he trotted  on regardless of observation. The fog, however, abated none of its  denseness even on the \"Surrey side,\" and before they reached the  \"Elephant and Castle,\" Jorrocks had run against two trucks, three  watercress women, one pies-all-ot!-all-ot! man, dispersed a whole covey  of Welsh milkmaids, and rode slap over one end of a buy 'at (hat) box!  bonnet-box! man's pole, damaging a dozen paste-boards, and finally  upsetting Balham Hill Joe's Barcelona \"come crack 'em and try 'em\" stall  at the door of the inn, for all whose benedictions, the Yorkshireman, as  this great fox-hunting knight-errant's \"Esquire,\" came in.    Here the Yorkshireman would fain have persuaded Mr. Jorrocks to  desist from his quixotic undertaking, but he turned a deaf ear to his  entreaties. \"We are getting fast into the country, and I hold it to  be utterly impossible for this fog to extend beyond Kennington  Common--'twill ewaporate, you'll see, as we approach the open. Indeed,  if I mistake not, I begin to sniff the morning air already, and hark!  there's a lark a-carrolling before us!\" \"Now, spooney! where are you  for?\" bellowed a carter, breaking off in the middle of his whistle, as  Jorrocks rode slap against his leader, the concussion at once dispelling  the pleasing pastoral delusion, and nearly knocking Jorrocks off his  horse.    As they approached Brixton Hill, a large red ball of lurid light  appeared in the firmament, and just at the moment up rode another member  of the Surrey Hunt in uniform, whom Jorrocks hailed as Mr. Crane. \"By  Jove, 'ow beautiful the moon is,\" said the latter, after the usual  salutations. \"Moon!\" said Mr. Jorrocks, \"that's not never no moon--I  reckon it's Mrs. Graham's balloon.\" \"Come, that's a good 'un,\" said  Crane, \"perhaps you'll lay me an 'at about it\". \"Done!\" said Mr.  Jorrocks, \"a guinea one--and we'll ax my friend here.--Now, what's  that?\" \"Why, judging from its position and the hour, I should say it is  the sun!\" was the reply.    We have omitted to mention that this memorable day was a Saturday,  one on which civic sportsmen exhibit. We may also premise, that the  particular hunt we are about to describe, took place when there were  very many packs of hounds within reach of the metropolis, all of which  boasted their respective admiring subscribers. As our party proceeded  they overtook a gentleman perusing a long bill of the meets for the  next week, of at least half a dozen packs, the top of the list being  decorated with a cut of a stag-hunt, and the bottom containing a  notification that hunters were \"carefully attended to by Charles  Morton,[10] at the 'Derby Arms,' Croydon,\" a snug rural _auberge_ near  the barrack. On the hunting bill-of-fare, were Mr. Jolliffe's foxhounds,  Mr. Meager's harriers, the Derby staghounds, the Sanderstead harriers,  the Union foxhounds, the Surrey foxhounds, rabbit beagles on Epsom  Downs, and dwarf foxhounds on Woolwich Common. What a list to bewilder a  stranger! The Yorkshireman left it all to Mr. Jorrocks.    [Footnote 10: Where the carrion is, there will be the crow, and on the  demise of the \"Surrey staggers,\" Charley brushed off to the west, to  valet the gentlemen's hunters that attend the Royal Stag Hunt.--_Vide_  Sir F. Grant's picture of the meet of the Royal Staghounds.]    \"You're for Jolliffe, I suppose,\" said the gentleman with the bill,  to another with a blue coat and buff lining. \"He's at Chipstead  Church--only six miles from Croydon, a sure find and good country.\"  \"What are you for, Mr. Jorrocks?\" inquired another in green, with black  velvet breeches, Hessian boots, and a red waistcoat, who just rode up.  \"My own, to be sure,\" said Jorrocks, taking hold of the green collar of  his coat, as much as to say, \"How can you ask such a question?\" \"Oh,  no,\" said the gentleman in green, \"Come to the stag--much better  sport--sure of a gallop--open country--get it over soon--back in town  before the post goes out.\" Before Mr. Jorrocks had time to make a reply  to this last interrogatory, they were overtaken by another horseman,  who came hopping along at a sort of a butcher's shuffle, on a worn-out,  three-legged, four-cornered hack, with one eye, a rat-tail, and a head  as large as a fiddle-case.--\"Who's for the blue mottles?\" said he,  casting a glance at their respective coats, and at length fixing it on  the Yorkshireman. \"Why, Dickens, you're not going thistle-whipping with  that nice 'orse of yours,\" said the gentleman in the velvets; \"come  and see the stag turned out--sure of a gallop--no hedges--soft  country--plenty of publics--far better sport, man, than pottering about  looking for your foxes and hares, and wasting your time; take my advice,  and come with me.\" \"But,\" says Dickens, \"my 'orse won't stand it; I had  him in the shay till eleven last night, and he came forty-three mile  with our traveller the day before, else he's a 'good 'un to go,' as you  know. Do you remember the owdacious leap he took over the tinker's tent,  at Epping 'Unt, last Easter? How he astonished the natives within!\"  \"Yes; but then, you know, you fell head-foremost through the canvas, and  no wonder your ugly mug frightened them,\" replied he of the velvets.  \"Ay; but that was in consequence of my riding by balance instead of  gripping with my legs,\" replied Dickens; \"you see, I had taken seven  lessons in riding at the school in Bidborough Street, Burton Crescent,  and they always told me to balance myself equally on the saddle, and  harden my heart, and ride at whatever came in the way; and the tinker's  tent coming first, why, naturally enough, I went at it. But I have had  some practice since then, and, of course, can stick on better. I have  'unted regularly ever since, and can 'do the trick' now.\" \"What, summer  and winter?\" said Jorrocks. \"No,\" replied he, \"but I have 'unted  regularly every fifth Saturday since the 'unting began.\"    After numerous discourses similar to the foregoing, they arrived at the  end of the first stage on the road to the hunt, namely, the small town  of Croydon, the rendezvous of London sportsmen. The whole place was  alive with red coats, green coats, blue coats, black coats, brown  coats, in short, coats of all the colours of the rainbow. Horsemen were  mounting, horsemen were dismounting, one-horse \"shays\" and two-horse  chaises were discharging their burdens, grooms were buckling on their  masters' spurs, and others were pulling off their overalls. Eschewing  the \"Greyhound,\" they turn short to the right, and make for the \"Derby  Arms\" hunting stables.    Charley Morton, a fine old boy of his age, was buckling on his armour  for the fight, for his soul, too, was \"on fire, and eager for the  chase.\" He was for the \"venison\"; and having mounted his \"deer-stalker,\"  was speedily joined by divers perfect \"swells,\" in beautiful leathers,  beautiful coats, beautiful tops, beautiful everything, except horses,  and off they rode to cut in for the first course--a stag-hunt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15399"],[0,"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The (#5)"],[1,"sons. They had likewise some extraordinary method of  discovering jealousy, theft, and poisoning; the success of which no  doubt they derived from their unbounded influence over the credulity  and superstition of the people. I do not remember what those methods  were, except that as to poisoning: I recollect an instance or two,  which I hope it will not be deemed impertinent here to insert, as it  may serve as a kind of specimen of the rest, and is still used by the  negroes in the West Indies. A virgin had been poisoned, but it was not  known by whom: the doctors ordered the corpse to be taken up by some  persons, and carried to the grave. As soon as the bearers had raised  it on their shoulders, they seemed seized with some[F] sudden  impulse, and ran to and fro unable to stop themselves. At last, after  having passed through a number of thorns and prickly bushes unhurt,  the corpse fell from them close to a house, and defaced it in the  fall; and, the owner being taken up, he immediately confessed the  poisoning[G].    The natives are extremely cautious about poison. When they buy any  eatable the seller kisses it all round before the buyer, to shew him  it is not poisoned; and the same is done when any meat or drink is  presented, particularly to a stranger. We have serpents of different  kinds, some of which are esteemed ominous when they appear in our  houses, and these we never molest. I remember two of those ominous  snakes, each of which was as thick as the calf of a man's leg, and in  colour resembling a dolphin in the water, crept at different times  into my mother's night-house, where I always lay with her, and coiled  themselves into folds, and each time they crowed like a cock. I was  desired by some of our wise men to touch these, that I might be  interested in the good omens, which I did, for they were quite  harmless, and would tamely suffer themselves to be handled; and then  they were put into a large open earthen pan, and set on one side of  the highway. Some of our snakes, however, were poisonous: one of them  crossed the road one day when I was standing on it, and passed between  my feet without offering to touch me, to the great surprise of many  who saw it; and these incidents were accounted by the wise men, and  therefore by my mother and the rest of the people, as remarkable omens  in my favour.    Such is the imperfect sketch my memory has furnished me with of the  manners and customs of a people among whom I first drew my breath. And  here I cannot forbear suggesting what has long struck me very  forcibly, namely, the strong analogy which even by this sketch,  imperfect as it is, appears to prevail in the manners and customs of  my countrymen and those of the Jews, before they reached the Land of  Promise, and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that  pastoral state which is described in Genesis--an analogy, which alone  would induce me to think that the one people had sprung from the  other. Indeed this is the opinion of Dr. Gill, who, in his commentary  on Genesis, very ably deduces the pedigree of the Africans from Afer  and Afra, the descendants of Abraham by Keturah his wife and concubine  (for both these titles are applied to her). It is also conformable to  the sentiments of Dr. John Clarke, formerly Dean of Sarum, in his  Truth of the Christian Religion: both these authors concur in  ascribing to us this original. The reasonings of these gentlemen are  still further confirmed by the scripture chronology; and if any  further corroboration were required, this resemblance in so many  respects is a strong evidence in support of the opinion. Like the  Israelites in their primitive state, our government was conducted by  our chiefs or judges, our wise men and elders; and the head of a  family with us enjoyed a similar authority over his household with  that which is ascribed to Abraham and the other patriarchs. The law of  retaliation obtained almost universally with us as with them: and even  their religion appeared to have shed upon us a ray of its glory,  though broken and spent in its passage, or eclipsed by the cloud with  which time, tradition, and ignorance might have enveloped it; for we  had our circumcision (a rule I believe peculiar to that people:) we  had also our sacrifices and burnt-offerings, our washings and  purifications, on the same occasions as they had.    As to the difference of colour between the Eboan Africans and the  modern Jews, I shall not presume to account for it. It is a subject  which has engaged the pens of men of both genius and learning, and is  far above my strength. The most able and Reverend Mr. T. Clarkson,  however, in his much admired Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the  Human Species, has ascertained the cause, in a manner that at once  solves every objection on that account, and, on my mind at least, has  produced the fullest conviction. I shall therefore refer to that  performance for the theory[H], contenting myself with extracting a  fact as related by Dr. Mitchel[I]. \"The Spaniards, who have inhabited  America, under the torrid zone, for any time, are become as dark  coloured as our native Indians of Virginia; of which _I myself have  been a witness_.\" There is also another instance[J] of a Portuguese  settlement at Mitomba, a river in Sierra Leona; where the inhabitants  are bred from a mixture of the first Portuguese discoverers with the  natives, and are now become in their complexion, and in the woolly  quality of their hair, _perfect negroes_, retaining however a  smattering of the Portuguese language.    These instances, and a great many more which might be adduced, while  they shew how the complexions of the same persons vary in different  climates, it is hoped may tend also to remove the prejudice that some  conceive against the natives of Africa on account of their colour.  Surely the minds of the Spaniards did not change with their  complexions! Are there not causes enough to which the apparent  inferiority of an African may be ascribed, without limiting the  goodness of God, and supposing he forbore to stamp understanding on  certainly his own image, because \"carved in ebony.\" Might it not  naturally be ascribed to their situation? When they come among  Europeans, they are ignorant of their language, religion, manners, and  customs. Are any pains taken to teach them these? Are they treated as  men? Does not slavery itself depress the mind, and extinguish all its  fire and every noble sentiment? But, above all, what advantages do not  a refined people possess over those who are rude and uncultivated. Let  the polished and haughty European recollect that his ancestors were  once, like the Africans, uncivilized, and even barbarous. Did Nature  make _them_ inferior to their sons? and should _they too_ have been  made slaves? Every rational mind answers, No. Let such reflections as  these melt the pride of their superiority into sympathy for the wants  and miseries of their sable brethren, and compel them to acknowledge,  that understanding is not confined to feature or colour. If, when they  look round the world, they feel exultation, let it be tempered with  benevolence to others, and gratitude to God, \"who hath made of one  blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth[K];  and whose wisdom is not our wisdom, neither are our ways his ways.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote A: See Benezet's \"Account of Guinea\" throughout.]    [Footnote B: When I was in Smyrna I have frequently seen the Greeks  dance after this manner.]    [Footnote C: The bowl is earthen, curiously figured, to which a long  reed is fixed as a tube.

Doran.--The chief mate, Mr. Mansfield, and some of the crew  being one day on shore, were present at the burying of a poisoned  negro girl. Though they had often heard of the circumstance of the  running in such cases, and had even seen it, they imagined it to be a  trick of the corpse-bearers. The mate therefore desired two of the  sailors to take up the coffin, and carry it to the grave. The sailors,  who were all of the same opinion, readily obeyed; but they had  scarcely raised it to their shoulders, before they began to run  furiously about, quite unable to direct themselves, till, at last,  without intention, they came to the hut of him who had poisoned the  girl. The coffin then immediately fell from their shoulders against  the hut, and damaged part of the wall. The owner of the hut was taken  into custody on this, and confessed the poisoning.--I give this story  as it was related by the mate and crew on their return to the ship.
