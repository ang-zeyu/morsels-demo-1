An image is an information which is received as it is, in the same way as it  would be generated by a TV-camera for instance. This kind of information,  without any meaning in fact, has to be integrated by the brain as an image-  model.    As we already know, M-models have to find some entities in that image. They  start by making a 3D-image. This is possible in a rather easy way because  almost all beings have two eyes. So there are two plane images and M-models  will make a 3D-image. Now, the basic problem is that from a 3D-image it is not  an easy task to identify the entities. M-models will use any supplementary  information associated with this 3D-model, as color, contrast, brightness, the  movement of some entities and so on. Anyways, M-models have to associate  entities to YM-models. This process could be affected by mistakes, but,  because M is a model, there will be a lot of crosschecks that will allow to  discover and correct some of the mistakes.    For instance, if something round is discovered, it could be an apple (YM-  apple) or a ball (YM-ball) or anything else.    Once a possible entity is associated with a YM, the M-model will predict how  this YM interacts with the other YMs of the model.    For instance, there is a YM-apple. It has a relation (it is very close to)  with a YM-table. So, from the predicted properties of the table, based on  simulation, it results that it can support an apple, and from the predicted  properties of the apple, it results that it can stay on that table. So, this  relation seems to be good and thus, maybe the YMs are OK.    Now another example: an apple is on a thin branch of a tree. From the  predicted properties of the branch, it results that it cannot support that  apple. So, the choosen YM-apple or YM-branch is not good. M-models have to  change something or to add something (maybe there is no gravity there...) to  be stable.    The exact procedures and methods can be different. Anyway, MDT is a basic  theory and it is not concerned with the technological implementation of the  functions of the brain. It is enough to say that there are basic methods to  solve the problems and also that the methods are not 100% safe, as everybody  knows from his/her direct interaction with the external reality.    What is obtained by this interaction is a preliminary M-model associated with  the external reality. This M-model is in interaction with, at least, one ZM-  model, which develops the M-model based on any other information available in  the brain.    These two processes happen almost simultaneously. As an M-model is made, a ZM-  model takes some information from the M-model and improves itself. Also, ZM  can change or add some information into the M-model, based on information  obtained from other M-models or ZM-models. These two processes are performed,  in fact, almost simultaneously due to this very close communication. They are  called M-(YM)-ZM processes. The aim is to make a better and better ZM-model  associated with a given external reality. As we know, such processes generate  the knowledge and the consciousness.    Faced with the same external reality, every brain makes and operates its own  structure of M-ZM models and so its own reality. For everyone, the reality is  generated by his/her own structure of harmonic/logic models. From this mode of  interaction, it does not result that faced with the same external reality,  everyone makes the same structure of models.    Example 1: If a painter and a forest ranger look at a tree, each will make  another M-ZM-model, and each will think and act based on one's own reality.    Example 2: When we drive a car in the city, M-models transmit the full  information on what is around, but ZM-models, which control the car, will use  only part of it. As the speed increases, ZM will process a smaller and smaller  part of the M-model, to drive the car. This phenomenon can be called the  narrowing of the consciousness field. It occurs every time when the brain is  overloaded.    Basically speaking, everything what was already presented up to now is about  the same for human and animal brains.    The exceptions are associated with symbolic models (which are based on logic).  The animals cannot make any symbolic models.    As we know, the basic function of any brain (human or animal) is to make and  operate image-models. Let's continue with the basic differences between the  human and animal brain.      THE HUMAN BRAIN (Introduction)    The basic difference between the animal brain and human brain is the capacity  of the human brain to make and operate symbolic models. The animals are not  able in any way or form to make and operate symbolic models.    We already analyzed how a human or animal brain interacts with an image to  make an image-model. For the symbolic models the interaction is different.    A symbolic model, as we know, uses as elements letters, words or numbers. When  a human brain interacts with such elements, the M-models will contain such  elements as specialized YM-models. Such YM-models contain all the shapes of  the letters, for instance. It is not necessary to discover the elements,  because they are there in an explicit way.    All the symbolic elements are contained in a symbolic model called General  Communication Language (GCL). There is a spoken language and a written  language, as directly interacting symbolic models. This is true only for  cultural zones which use alphabets. There is a specific application which  treats this problem.    For a given written text, we have all the elements and all the relations  between the elements, in an explicit way, as words. Usually, the elements are  the nouns and the relations between them are the verbs. Any sentence is a  symbolic model, for instance.    Example: the sentence: \"I go home\" has two elements \"I\" and \"home\" and a  relation between the elements as \"go\".    The stability of the symbolic models is based on logic. When a symbolic model  is stable we call it a logical model. A logical (stable) model can be  understood by anybody who can make and operate symbolic models.    Sometimes there is a correspondence between image-models and symbolic-models  as in the following example.    Example: Let's analyze the sentence \"An apple falls from an apple-tree\". We  have two elements and a relation between them. On the other hand, we can make  an image-model that describes the same situation: an apple falls from an  apple-tree.    So, the logic could have been born in the process of translation from an image  model to a symbolic model (when the translation is possible). As an image-  model is stable based on laws of harmony, a symbolic model is stable based on  the laws of logic.    Here we have in an implicit way the definitions of harmony and logic, as the  rules and methods to ensure the stability of an image-model (harmony) or a  symbolic-model (logic). An implicit definition means that we are able to  recognize the effect of harmony or logic in a structure of data.        THE HUMAN BRAIN VERSUS ANIMAL BRAIN    MDT is a theory that treats the human and animal brain in the same framework.    I present here a possible evolution of the brain, from animal brain to human  brain. It is very important to specify that the theory is like a tool: it does  not support and also does not reject the evolutionist theory. MDT just  describes the situation.    For any external reality, the brain (human or animal) will make an image-  model. This function is basically the same for human and animal brain.    In a given external reality many similar elements could exist. For any  element, the brain has to make a YM-model.    For instance, a dog has to make a YM for any dog which it meets. Such a big  number of models use a lot of the brain resources.    When there are many similar elements, a solution is to make a concept-YM. Such  a YM will fit a big number of similar elements. This reduces the quantity of  data to be processed by an animal brain, and so, the brain becomes faster and  more efficient.    Thus, the first level of evolution of the brain (level 1) is the extensive use  of the concept models. This level is, probably, reached by all animals.    Observation: the human and animal beings continue to use, for some special  situations, pure image models. A pure image model is a YM-model associated  with a single entity of the external reality. For instance, a cub has a pure  image model of its mother.    The first step of the evolution of the brain is based on concept models. A  concept model fits an entire class of entities of the external reality. During  the interaction, the brain will use a concept model and then, in M-ZM, new  properties will be added, or even new elements, if necessary, to understand  better and better the external reality.    The evolution of the brain continues with level 2. This new facility is based  on label-models. As we know, faced with a given external reality, the brain  makes an M-ZM model that is able to predict the evolution of the present  external reality. Such models are called local-M-ZM. On level 2, it is  possible to make a new type of models, which are called label-models. A label-  model is able to activate a ZM-model, from the available models of the brain,  regardless of the local-M-ZM.    Example: an animal senses a specific smell. This can be associated with food  or with danger, for instance. In such a situation, the animal can activate a  specific ZM-model, which has no direct connection with the local-M-ZM model.  This is level 2 of the evolution of the brain.    At this level, a special kind of communication between animals occurs. This  kind of communication based on label-models is used by human beings as well.  It is not precise enough and is also very limited, but useful in many  situations, and very fast too."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14591"],[0,"Faust [part 1]. Translated Into English in the Original Metres (#5)"],[1,"lus_)    I like, at times, to hear The Ancient's word,  And have a care to be most civil:  It's really kind of such a noble Lord  So humanly to gossip with the Devil!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]          FIRST PART OF THE TRAGEDY    I    NIGHT    (_A lofty-arched, narrow, Gothic chamber_. FAUST, _in a chair at his  desk, restless_.)      FAUST    I've studied now Philosophy  And Jurisprudence, Medicine,--  And even, alas! Theology,--  From end to end, with labor keen;  And here, poor fool! with all my lore  I stand, no wiser than before:  I'm Magister--yea, Doctor--hight,  And straight or cross-wise, wrong or right,  These ten years long, with many woes,  I've led my scholars by the nose,--  And see, that nothing can be known!  _That_ knowledge cuts me to the bone.  I'm cleverer, true, than those fops of teachers,  Doctors and Magisters, Scribes and Preachers;  Neither scruples nor doubts come now to smite me,  Nor Hell nor Devil can longer affright me.    For this, all pleasure am I foregoing;  I do not pretend to aught worth knowing,  I do not pretend I could be a teacher  To help or convert a fellow-creature.  Then, too, I've neither lands nor gold,  Nor the world's least pomp or honor hold--  No dog would endure such a curst existence!  Wherefore, from Magic I seek assistance,  That many a secret perchance I reach  Through spirit-power and spirit-speech,  And thus the bitter task forego  Of saying the things I do not know,--  That I may detect the inmost force  Which binds the world, and guides its course;  Its germs, productive powers explore,  And rummage in empty words no more!    O full and splendid Moon, whom I  Have, from this desk, seen climb the sky  So many a midnight,--would thy glow  For the last time beheld my woe!  Ever thine eye, most mournful friend,  O'er books and papers saw me bend;  But would that I, on mountains grand,  Amid thy blessed light could stand,  With spirits through mountain-caverns hover,  Float in thy twilight the meadows over,  And, freed from the fumes of lore that swathe me,  To health in thy dewy fountains bathe me!    Ah, me! this dungeon still I see.  This drear, accursed masonry,  Where even the welcome daylight strains  But duskly through the painted panes.  Hemmed in by many a toppling heap  Of books worm-eaten, gray with dust,  Which to the vaulted ceiling creep,  Against the smoky paper thrust,--  With glasses, boxes, round me stacked,  And instruments together hurled,  Ancestral lumber, stuffed and packed--  Such is my world: and what a world!    And do I ask, wherefore my heart  Falters, oppressed with unknown needs?  Why some inexplicable smart  All movement of my life impedes?  Alas! in living Nature's stead,  Where God His human creature set,  In smoke and mould the fleshless dead  And bones of beasts surround me yet!    Fly! Up, and seek the broad, free land!  And this one Book of Mystery  From Nostradamus' very hand,  Is't not sufficient company?  When I the starry courses know,  And Nature's wise instruction seek,  With light of power my soul shall glow,  As when to spirits spirits speak.  Tis vain, this empty brooding here,  Though guessed the holy symbols be:  Ye, Spirits, come--ye hover near--  Oh, if you hear me, answer me!    (_He opens the Book, and perceives the sign of the Macrocosm_.)    Ha! what a sudden rapture leaps from this  I view, through all my senses swiftly flowing!  I feel a youthful, holy, vital bliss  In every vein and fibre newly glowing.  Was it a God, who traced this sign,  With calm across my tumult stealing,  My troubled heart to joy unsealing,  With impulse, mystic and divine,  The powers of Nature here, around my path, revealing?  Am I a God?--so clear mine eyes!  In these pure features I behold  Creative Nature to my soul unfold.  What says the sage, now first I recognize:  \"The spirit-world no closures fasten;  Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead:  Disciple, up! untiring, hasten  To bathe thy breast in morning-red!\"    (_He contemplates the sign_.)    How each the Whole its substance gives,  Each in the other works and lives!  Like heavenly forces rising and descending,  Their golden urns reciprocally lending,  With wings that winnow blessing  From Heaven through Earth I see them pressing,  Filling the All with harmony unceasing!  How grand a show! but, ah! a show alone.  Thee, boundless Nature, how make thee my own?  Where you, ye beasts? Founts of all Being, shining,  Whereon hang Heaven's and Earth's desire,  Whereto our withered hearts aspire,--  Ye flow, ye feed: and am I vainly pining?    (_He turns the leaves impatiently, and perceives the sign of the  Earth-Spirit_.)    How otherwise upon me works this sign!  Thou, Spirit of the Earth, art nearer:  Even now my powers are loftier, clearer;  I glow, as drunk with new-made wine:  New strength and heart to meet the world incite me,  The woe of earth, the bliss of earth, invite me,  And though the shock of storms may smite me,  No crash of shipwreck shall have power to fright me!  Clouds gather over me--  The moon conceals her light--  The lamp's extinguished!--  Mists rise,--red, angry rays are darting  Around my head!--There falls  A horror from the vaulted roof,  And seizes me!  I feel thy presence, Spirit I invoke!  Reveal thyself!  Ha! in my heart what rending stroke!  With new impulsion  My senses heave in this convulsion!  I feel thee draw my heart, absorb, exhaust me:  Thou must! thou must! and though my life it cost me!    (_He seizes the book, and mysteriously pronounces the sign of  the Spirit. A ruddy flame flashes: the Spirit appears in  the flame_.)      SPIRIT    Who calls me?      FAUST (_with averted head_)    Terrible to see!      SPIRIT    Me hast thou long with might attracted,  Long from my sphere thy food exacted,  And now--    FAUST      Woe! I endure not thee!      SPIRIT    To view me is thine aspiration,  My voice to hear, my countenance to see;  Thy powerful yearning moveth me,  Here am I!--what mean perturbation  Thee, superhuman, shakes? Thy soul's high calling, where?  Where is the breast, which from itself a world did bear,  And shaped and cherished--which with joy expanded,  To be our peer, with us, the Spirits, banded?  Where art thou, Faust, whose voice has pierced to me,  Who towards me pressed with all thine energy?  _He_ art thou, who, my presence breathing, seeing,  Trembles through all the depths of being,  A writhing worm, a terror-stricken form?      FAUST    Thee, form of flame, shall I then fear?  Yes, I am Faust: I am thy peer!      SPIRIT      In the tides of Life, in Action's storm,    A fluctuant wave,    A shuttle free,    Birth and the Grave,    An eternal sea,    A weaving, flowing    Life, all-glowing,  Thus at Time's humming loom 'tis my hand prepares  The garment of Life which the Deity wears!      FAUST    Thou, who around the wide world wendest,  Thou busy Spirit, how near I feel to thee!      SPIRIT    Thou'rt like the Spirit which thou comprehendest,  Not me!    (_Disappears_.)      FAUST (_overwhelmed_)    Not thee!  Whom then?  I, image of the Godhead!  Not even like thee!    (_A knock_).    O Death!--I know it--'tis my Famulus!  My fairest luck finds no fruition:  In all the fullness of my vision  The soulless sneak disturbs me thus!    (_Enter_ WAGNER_, in dressing-gown and night-cap, a lamp in  his hand. _FAUST_ turns impatiently_.)      WAGNER    Pardon, I heard your declamation;  'Twas sure an old Greek tragedy you read?  In such an art I crave some preparation,  Since now it stands one in good stead.  I've often heard it said, a preacher  Might learn, with a comedian for a teacher.      FAUST    Yes, when the priest comedian is by nature,  As haply now and then the case may be.      WAGNER    Ah, when one studies thus, a prisoned creature,  That scarce the world on holidays can see,--  Scarce through a glass, by rare occasion,  How shall one lead it by persuasion?      FAUST    You'll ne'er attain it, save you know the feeling,  Save from the soul it rises clear,  Serene in primal strength, compelling  The hearts and minds of all who hear.  You sit forever gluing, patching;  You cook the scraps from others' fare;  And from your heap of ashes hatching  A starveling flame, ye blow it bare!  Take children's, monkeys' gaze admiring,  If such your taste, and be content;  But ne'er from heart to heart you'll speak inspiring,  Save your own heart is eloquent!      WAGNER    Yet through delivery orators succeed;  I feel that I am far behind, indeed.      FAUST    Seek thou the honest recompense!  Beware, a tinkling fool to be!  With little art, clear wit and sense  Suggest their own delivery;  And if thou'rt moved to speak in earnest,  What need, that after words thou yearnest?  Yes, your discourses, with their glittering show,  Where ye for men twist shredded thought like paper,  Are unrefreshing as the winds that blow  The rustling leaves through chill autumnal vapor!      WAGNER    Ah, God! but Art is long,  And Life, alas! is fleeting.  And oft, with zeal my critic-duties meeting,  In head and breast there's something wrong.    How hard it is to compass the assistance  Whereby one rises to the source!  And, haply, ere one travels half the course  Must the poor devil quit existence.      FAUST    Is parchment, then, the holy fount before thee,  A draught wherefrom thy thirst forever slakes?  No true refreshment can restore thee,  Save what from thine own soul spontaneous breaks.      WAGNER    Pardon! a great delight is granted  When, in the spirit of the ages planted,  We mark how, ere our times, a sage has thought,  And then, how far his work, and grandly, we have brought.

Listen, my friend: the ages that are past  Are now a book with seven seals protected:  What you the Spirit of the Ages call  Is nothing but the spirit of you all,  Wherein the Ages are reflected.
