He is in want of new fellowships and must strengthen  himself by joining various bodies and associations. With these he  incorporates himself more or less and his friendly attitude towards them  for his own good is a development of the primitive Family Affection. In  the case of a class, a social, or professional community the sentiment  is termed _Esprit de Corps_;[7] in view of recognized civil institutions  by which he perceives that he benefits, it is Loyalty; while with  respect to the Fatherland it is Patriotism, which denotes the adherence  of the helpless individual Ego to the Supreme Community. Patriotism,  like Family Affection, is a growth and culture of the idea of Self. It  is the expression of the Individual's thanks for the support,  countenance, protection, and other moral and material advantages claimed  by him from the Supreme Community, to which in return he readily attorns  with respect and admiration. He is, however, patriotic because with  unconscious egotism he regards his Country as part of himself rather  than himself as part of his Country. Even the act of a man who  sacrifices his life for the good of his country may not be wholly  unselfish, for some natures are so constituted that they can discount  the future and be gratified by the prospective award of posthumous  honour. There can, however, be no doubt that Patriotism, though possibly  of not very noble origin, is a sentiment beneficial both to the  community and the individual, and is therefore worthy of encouragement.  Happily, those cold heights of philosophy on which every man is loved as  a brother and every nationality held in equal honour and esteem are  unattainable by human nature; for without the stimulus of Patriotism  National Life would be impracticable.[8] It's chief defect is that like  most of the emotions it is sometimes hasty and unreasoning.    Such, it is believed, is briefly the history of Patriotism, and the  theory is supported by the fact that the British soldier is not  patriotic by nature. It is not his fault. The class from which he is  usually drawn has unhappily less reason for respecting and admiring the  Supreme Community than any other class, for it participates fully in the  distresses and meagerly in the successes and good fortune of the Nation,  from which, though not actually unpatriotic, it stands sullenly aloof.  It can hardly be denied that the power and prosperity of Great Britain  have favourably affected the position of the upper and middle classes to  a greater degree than they have ameliorated the condition of the lower  classes, and it is therefore not surprising that the latter seem to take  little or no pride in their nationality, and sometimes even act  perversely in opposition to its interests.    The private soldier has never been taught to think about his country.  The education which he may have received at the Board School is not  calculated to arouse in him a feeling of national pride which is  non-existent in his home life. The display of the National Flag, which  flutters over so many distant lands, is discouraged in the primary  schools of Great Britain as tending to \"flag-worship.\" In the United  States, on the other hand, the Stars and Stripes are hoisted in every  school yard. No systematic effort is made to interest the children of  the operative classes in Greater Britain. India and the Colonies are  facts in geography troublesome to learn and easy to forget. The history  of the British Empire is sterilized before it is imparted to them. They  are not taught to realize that the happiness and prosperity of a large  proportion of the inhabitants of the world are dependent upon the moods  of the population of a small group of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, and  that in the ballot-boxes of Great Britain are cast the fortunes of many  millions of their fellow-creatures.    Foreigners have remarked that the minstrelsy of Great Britain is  singularly devoid of patriotic songs. The British soldier has no  \"Star-Spangled Banner\" or \"Wacht am Rhein\" to sing on the line of march  or in the bivouac, but only the last comic or sentimental ditty which he  may have heard at the Garrison Music Hall before embarking on active  service. The National Anthem is not a patriotic song but a prayer for  Divine Protection for the Sovereign, to which have been appended some  inappropriate stanzas now rarely heard; while \"Rule, Britannia!\" might  have been composed for the gasconading swashbuckler of an extravaganza.    It would therefore be surprising if the recruit joined the Army with a  highly pitched conception of the work he has undertaken. Destitution; or  trouble about a woman, or with his own people, or with the police; or  the mysterious magnetism of an adventurous life rather than the desire  to serve his country, has induced him to enlist. An existing or  prospective War always keeps the recruiting sergeant busy, but the  object of a War is a matter of indifference to the recruit. Most of our  wars have been waged for political reasons which he cannot understand.  Apart from the difficulties of language and of unaccustomed  environments, he would as readily serve in any other Army in which the  pay was as liberal and the restraint of discipline not more irksome. How  is it, then, that lacking the stimulus of Patriotism through no fault of  his own and being, in fact, a mercenary, he becomes an excellent  soldier; perhaps, next to the Turk, the best in Europe?    The answer seems to be that he soon acquires a high sense of Duty. Duty  may be defined as the necessity to do something for one's own or for the  general good which is not naturally pleasurable or agreeable or  instinctively desired. In the trite proverb it is contrasted with and  takes precedence of Pleasure. As a motive for action it stands on a  higher plane than Patriotism.    The alchemic process by which the indifferent, unemotional, and  sometimes unintelligent recruit is transmuted into the precious metal of  the soldier who wins battles seems to be somewhat as follows: Of his own  volition he has taken on a certain job and his dogged pride or obstinacy  will not allow him to be beaten by it, however little enthusiasm it may  arouse in him and however distasteful it may be to him at first. He  offers no \"ca' canny\" service, but plods on and does his best in his own  way. The lack of the enthusiastic temperament does not seriously retard  the progress of his military education, and without much ado he becomes  a stolid dependable unit of the Army. He is not carried away by success  nor unduly depressed by failure. His instincts tell him that they are  the accidents of Duty.    It has been noticed that the word Glory and its derivatives[9] rarely  appear in the accounts of the action of the British Army on service,  except in a War Correspondent's letter or telegram. No reference is made  in reports, orders or despatches to the so-called \"glorious\" incidents  of a soldier's life in time of war. He is commended for his endurance,  his tenacity and his matter-of-fact acceptance of the vicissitudes of  war as \"part of the day's work.\" The truest Glory is the conscientious  performance of Duty.    If through the incompetence or neglect of his leaders he is called upon  to sacrifice himself, he sacrifices himself without a murmur. If he is  compelled to keep himself alive on scanty rations of horseflesh and to  wet his parched lips with the trickle of a dwindled and tainted spruit,  he believes that his officers have done their best for him. He is  ordered to fall in upon the deck of a burning troopship and to stand at  attention while Death inspects the ranks. He is besieged in a hill fort  on the Indian frontier by a horde of fanatics eager to kill or to  mutilate him. He lies wounded on the field of battle from which, after  an indecisive engagement, each combatant has retired; and there,  scorched by the mid-day sun and starved by the cold of the night, and  perhaps also in danger of being burnt alive by a veld fire, he waits  without water for the armistice which shall bring up the ambulances. He  returns to his own land where he soon finds that he is not of much  account. After a great war there may be a period of evanescent  patronage; or a deed of Dargai, Rorke's Drift, or Balaklava may have  temporarily thrilled the audience into Music Hall enthusiasm; but he is  not greatly impressed, and stoically reflects that like the battle, the  starvation, and the Field Hospital it is \"all in the day's work\" and  will soon pass away.    There has probably never been a struggle in which the private soldier  more fully earned the gratitude of his country than in the South African  War. The most unfriendly critics in the foreign staff offices have paid  tribute to the excellence of the British soldier: sometimes, however,  sneering at him as a mercenary, whom, by a curious perversion of the  probabilities, they profess to think unlikely to be as efficient as  their own conscripts who are forced into military service; but they  never hold him responsible for the ill-success of the war. Throughout  their criticisms there lurks a feeling of pained astonishment that the  British \"mercenary\" proves himself to be as good or even a better  soldier than the continental conscript, coupled with a comfortable  conviction that Discipline is not well maintained in the British Army.    The final cause of Discipline is the efficient use of arms on the field  of battle. Discipline is the result of an irksome educational process by  which a man is taught to submit his wishes, his instincts, and, to a  great extent, his personal liberty to the control of one who may be his  inferior morally, mentally, and physically.

So you see, Daddy, my education progresses!    Don't you really think that I ought to be an artist instead of an  author?    Vacation will be over in two days and I shall be glad to see the girls  again.  My tower is just a trifle lonely; when nine people occupy a  house that was built for four hundred, they do rattle around a bit.    Eleven pages--poor Daddy, you must be tired!  I meant this to be just a  short little thank-you note--but when I get started I seem to have a  ready pen.    Goodbye, and thank you for thinking of me--I should be perfectly happy  except for one little threatening cloud on the horizon.  Examinations  come in February.                                       Yours with love,                                                     Judy    PS.  Maybe it isn't proper to send love?  If it isn't, please excuse.  But I must love somebody and there's only you and Mrs. Lippett to  choose between, so you see--you'll HAVE to put up with it, Daddy dear,  because I can't love her.                                                         On the Eve    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    You should see the way this college is studying!  We've forgotten we  ever had a vacation.  Fifty-seven irregular verbs have I introduced to  my brain in the past four days--I'm only hoping they'll stay till after  examinations.    Some of the girls sell their text-books when they're through with them,  but I intend to keep mine.  Then after I've graduated I shall have my  whole education in a row in the bookcase, and when I need to use any  detail, I can turn to it without the slightest hesitation.  So much  easier and more accurate than trying to keep it in your head.    Julia Pendleton dropped in this evening to pay a social call, and  stayed a solid hour.  She got started on the subject of family, and I  COULDN'T switch her off.  She wanted to know what my mother's maiden  name was--did you ever hear such an impertinent question to ask of a  person from a foundling asylum?  I didn't have the courage to say I  didn't know, so I just miserably plumped on the first name I could  think of, and that was Montgomery.  Then she wanted to know whether I  belonged to the Massachusetts Montgomerys or the Virginia Montgomerys.    Her mother was a Rutherford.  The family came over in the ark, and were  connected by marriage with Henry the VIII.  On her father's side they  date back further than Adam.  On the topmost branches of her family  tree there's a superior breed of monkeys with very fine silky hair and  extra long tails.    I meant to write you a nice, cheerful, entertaining letter tonight, but  I'm too sleepy--and scared.  The Freshman's lot is not a happy one.               Yours, about to be examined,                                              Judy Abbott                                                         Sunday    Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,    I have some awful, awful, awful news to tell you, but I won't begin  with it; I'll try to get you in a good humour first.    Jerusha Abbott has commenced to be an author.  A poem entitled, 'From  my Tower', appears in the February Monthly--on the first page, which is  a very great honour for a Freshman.  My English instructor stopped me  on the way out from chapel last night, and said it was a charming piece  of work except for the sixth line, which had too many feet.  I will  send you a copy in case you care to read it.    Let me see if I can't think of something else pleasant--  Oh, yes!  I'm  learning to skate, and can glide about quite respectably all by myself.  Also I've learned how to slide down a rope from the roof of the  gymnasium, and I can vault a bar three feet and six inches high--I hope  shortly to pull up to four feet.    We had a very inspiring sermon this morning preached by the Bishop of  Alabama.  His text was:  'Judge not that ye be not judged.' It was  about the necessity of overlooking mistakes in others, and not  discouraging people by harsh judgments.  I wish you might have heard it.    This is the sunniest, most blinding winter afternoon, with icicles  dripping from the fir trees and all the world bending under a weight of  snow--except me, and I'm bending under a weight of sorrow.    Now for the news--courage, Judy!--you must tell.    Are you SURELY in a good humour?  I failed in mathematics and Latin  prose.  I am tutoring in them, and will take another examination next  month.  I'm sorry if you're disappointed, but otherwise I don't care a  bit because I've learned such a lot of things not mentioned in the  catalogue.  I've read seventeen novels and bushels of poetry--really  necessary novels like Vanity Fair and Richard Feverel and Alice in  Wonderland.  Also Emerson's Essays and Lockhart's Life of Scott and the  first volume of Gibbon's Roman Empire and half of Benvenuto Cellini's  Life--wasn't he entertaining?  He used to saunter out and casually kill  a man before breakfast.    So you see, Daddy, I'm much more intelligent than if I'd just stuck to  Latin.  Will you forgive me this once if I promise never to fail again?                               Yours in sackcloth,                                                     Judy          Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    This is an extra letter in the middle of the month because I'm rather  lonely tonight.  It's awfully stormy.  All the lights are out on the  campus, but I drank black coffee and I can't go to sleep.    I had a supper party this evening consisting of Sallie and Julia and  Leonora Fenton--and sardines and toasted muffins and salad and fudge  and coffee.  Julia said she'd had a good time, but Sallie stayed to  help wash the dishes.      I might, very usefully, put some time on Latin tonight but, there's no  doubt about it, I'm a very languid Latin scholar.  We've finished Livy  and De Senectute and are now engaged with De Amicitia (pronounced Damn  Icitia).    Should you mind, just for a little while, pretending you are my  grandmother?  Sallie has one and Julia and Leonora each two, and they  were all comparing them tonight.  I can't think of anything I'd rather  have; it's such a respectable relationship.  So, if you really don't  object--When I went into town yesterday, I saw the sweetest cap of  Cluny lace trimmed with lavender ribbon.  I am going to make you a  present of it on your eighty-third birthday.    ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !    That's the clock in the chapel tower striking twelve.  I believe I am  sleepy after all.                               Good night, Granny.                               I love you dearly.                                                 Judy                                               The Ides of March    Dear D.-L.-L.,    I am studying Latin prose composition.  I have been studying it.  I  shall be studying it.  I shall be about to have been studying it.  My  re-examination comes the 7th hour next Tuesday, and I am going to pass  or BUST.  So you may expect to hear from me next, whole and happy and  free from conditions, or in fragments.    I will write a respectable letter when it's over.  Tonight I have a  pressing engagement with the Ablative Absolute.                       Yours--in evident haste                                             J. A.                                                 26th  March    Mr. D.-L.-L. Smith,    SIR:  You never answer any questions; you never show the slightest  interest in anything I do.  You are probably the horridest one of all  those horrid Trustees, and the reason you are educating me is, not  because you care a bit about me, but from a sense of Duty.    I don't know a single thing about you.  I don't even know your name.  It is very uninspiring writing to a Thing.  I haven't a doubt but that  you throw my letters into the waste-basket without reading them.  Hereafter I shall write only about work.    My re-examinations in Latin and geometry came last week.  I passed them  both and am now free from conditions.                           Yours truly,                                     Jerusha Abbott                                                         2nd April    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I am a BEAST.    Please forget about that dreadful letter I sent you last week--I was  feeling terribly lonely and miserable and sore-throaty the night I  wrote.  I didn't know it, but I was just sickening for tonsillitis and  grippe and lots of things mixed.  I'm in the infirmary now, and have  been here for six days; this is the first time they would let me sit up  and have a pen and paper.  The head nurse is very bossy.  But I've been  thinking about it all the time and I shan't get well until you forgive  me.    Here is a picture of the way I look, with a bandage tied around my head  in rabbit's ears.    Doesn't that arouse your sympathy?  I am having sublingual gland  swelling.  And I've been studying physiology all the year without ever  hearing of sublingual glands.  How futile a thing is education!    I can't write any more; I get rather shaky when I sit up too long.  Please forgive me for being impertinent and ungrateful.  I was badly  brought up.                           Yours with love,                                           Judy Abbott                                                 THE INFIRMARY                                                     4th April    Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,    Yesterday evening just towards dark, when I was sitting up in bed  looking out at the rain and feeling awfully bored with life in a great  institution, the nurse appeared with a long white box addressed to me,  and filled with the LOVELIEST pink rosebuds.  And much nicer still, it  contained a card with a very polite message written in a funny little  uphill back hand (but one which shows a great deal of character). Thank  you, Daddy, a thousand times.  Your flowers make the first real, true  present I ever received in my life.  If you want to know what a baby I  am I lay down and cried"]]]
