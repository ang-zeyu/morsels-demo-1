The Comte de Chagny, who was one of those standing outside, laughed:    \"Oh, the rogue, the rogue!\"  And he added, under his breath: \"Those  youngsters with their school-girl airs!  So he's a Chagny after all!\"    He turned to go to Sorelli's dressing-room, but met her on the way,  with her little troop of trembling ballet-girls, as we have seen.    Meanwhile, Christine Daae uttered a deep sigh, which was answered by a  groan.  She turned her head, saw Raoul and started.  She looked at the  doctor, on whom she bestowed a smile, then at her maid, then at Raoul  again.    \"Monsieur,\" she said, in a voice not much above a whisper, \"who are  you?\"    \"Mademoiselle,\" replied the young man, kneeling on one knee and  pressing a fervent kiss on the diva's hand, \"I AM THE LITTLE BOY WHO  WENT INTO THE SEA TO RESCUE YOUR SCARF.\"    Christine again looked at the doctor and the maid; and all three began  to laugh.    Raoul turned very red and stood up.    \"Mademoiselle,\" he said, \"since you are pleased not to recognize me, I  should like to say something to you in private, something very  important.\"    \"When I am better, do you mind?\"  And her voice shook.  \"You have been  very good.\"    \"Yes, you must go,\" said the doctor, with his pleasantest smile.  \"Leave me to attend to mademoiselle.\"    \"I am not ill now,\" said Christine suddenly, with strange and  unexpected energy.    She rose and passed her hand over her eyelids.    \"Thank you, Doctor.  I should like to be alone.  Please go away, all of  you.  Leave me.  I feel very restless this evening.\"    The doctor tried to make a short protest, but, perceiving the girl's  evident agitation, he thought the best remedy was not to thwart her.  And he went away, saying to Raoul, outside:    \"She is not herself to-night. She is usually so gentle.\"    Then he said good night and Raoul was left alone.  The whole of this  part of the theater was now deserted.  The farewell ceremony was no  doubt taking place in the foyer of the ballet.  Raoul thought that Daae  might go to it and he waited in the silent solitude, even hiding in the  favoring shadow of a doorway.  He felt a terrible pain at his heart and  it was of this that he wanted to speak to Daae without delay.    Suddenly the dressing-room door opened and the maid came out by  herself, carrying bundles.  He stopped her and asked how her mistress  was.  The woman laughed and said that she was quite well, but that he  must not disturb her, for she wished to be left alone.  And she passed  on.  One idea alone filled Raoul's burning brain:  of course, Daae  wished to be left alone FOR HIM!  Had he not told her that he wanted to  speak to her privately?    Hardly breathing, he went up to the dressing-room and, with his ear to  the door to catch her reply, prepared to knock.  But his hand dropped.  He had heard A MAN'S VOICE in the dressing-room, saying, in a curiously  masterful tone:    \"Christine, you must love me!\"    And Christine's voice, infinitely sad and trembling, as though  accompanied by tears, replied:    \"How can you talk like that?  WHEN I SING ONLY FOR YOU!\"    Raoul leaned against the panel to ease his pain.  His heart, which had  seemed gone for ever, returned to his breast and was throbbing loudly.  The whole passage echoed with its beating and Raoul's ears were  deafened.  Surely, if his heart continued to make such a noise, they  would hear it inside, they would open the door and the young man would  be turned away in disgrace.  What a position for a Chagny!  To be  caught listening behind a door!  He took his heart in his two hands to  make it stop.    The man's voice spoke again:  \"Are you very tired?\"    \"Oh, to-night I gave you my soul and I am dead!\"  Christine replied.    \"Your soul is a beautiful thing, child,\" replied the grave man's voice,  \"and I thank you.  No emperor ever received so fair a gift.  THE ANGELS  WEPT TONIGHT.\"    Raoul heard nothing after that.  Nevertheless, he did not go away, but,  as though he feared lest he should be caught, he returned to his dark  corner, determined to wait for the man to leave the room.  At one and  the same time, he had learned what love meant, and hatred.  He knew  that he loved.  He wanted to know whom he hated.  To his great  astonishment, the door opened and Christine Daae appeared, wrapped in  furs, with her face hidden in a lace veil, alone.  She closed the door  behind her, but Raoul observed that she did not lock it.  She passed  him.  He did not even follow her with his eyes, for his eyes were fixed  on the door, which did not open again.    When the passage was once more deserted, he crossed it, opened the door  of the dressing-room, went in and shut the door.  He found himself in  absolute darkness.  The gas had been turned out.    \"There is some one here!\" said Raoul, with his back against the closed  door, in a quivering voice.  \"What are you hiding for?\"    All was darkness and silence.  Raoul heard only the sound of his own  breathing.  He quite failed to see that the indiscretion of his conduct  was exceeding all bounds.    \"You shan't leave this until I let you!\" he exclaimed.  \"If you don't  answer, you are a coward!  But I'll expose you!\"    And he struck a match.  The blaze lit up the room.  There was no one in  the room!  Raoul, first turning the key in the door, lit the gas-jets.  He went into the dressing-closet, opened the cupboards, hunted about,  felt the walls with his moist hands.  Nothing!    \"Look here!\" he said, aloud.  \"Am I going mad?\"    He stood for ten minutes listening to the gas flaring in the silence of  the empty room; lover though he was, he did not even think of stealing  a ribbon that would have given him the perfume of the woman he loved.  He went out, not knowing what he was doing nor where he was going.  At  a given moment in his wayward progress, an icy draft struck him in the  face.  He found himself at the bottom of a staircase, down which,  behind him, a procession of workmen were carrying a sort of stretcher,  covered with a white sheet.    \"Which is the way out, please?\" he asked of one of the men.    \"Straight in front of you, the door is open.  But let us pass.\"    Pointing to the stretcher, he asked mechanically:  \"What's that?\"    The workmen answered:    \"'That' is Joseph Buquet, who was found in the third cellar, hanging  between a farm-house and a scene from the ROI DE LAHORE.\"    He took off his hat, fell back to make room for the procession and went  out.        Chapter III The Mysterious Reason      During this time, the farewell ceremony was taking place.  I have  already said that this magnificent function was being given on the  occasion of the retirement of M. Debienne and M. Poligny, who had  determined to \"die game,\" as we say nowadays.  They had been assisted  in the realization of their ideal, though melancholy, program by all  that counted in the social and artistic world of Paris.  All these  people met, after the performance, in the foyer of the ballet, where  Sorelli waited for the arrival of the retiring managers with a glass of  champagne in her hand and a little prepared speech at the tip of her  tongue.  Behind her, the members of the Corps de Ballet, young and old,  discussed the events of the day in whispers or exchanged discreet  signals with their friends, a noisy crowd of whom surrounded the  supper-tables arranged along the slanting floor.    A few of the dancers had already changed into ordinary dress; but most  of them wore their skirts of gossamer gauze; and all had thought it the  right thing to put on a special face for the occasion:  all, that is,  except little Jammes, whose fifteen summers--happy age!--seemed already  to have forgotten the ghost and the death of Joseph Buquet.  She never  ceased to laugh and chatter, to hop about and play practical jokes,  until Mm. Debienne and Poligny appeared on the steps of the foyer, when  she was severely called to order by the impatient Sorelli.    Everybody remarked that the retiring managers looked cheerful, as is  the Paris way.  None will ever be a true Parisian who has not learned  to wear a mask of gaiety over his sorrows and one of sadness, boredom  or indifference over his inward joy.  You know that one of your friends  is in trouble; do not try to console him: he will tell you that he is  already comforted; but, should he have met with good fortune, be  careful how you congratulate him:  he thinks it so natural that he is  surprised that you should speak of it.  In Paris, our lives are one  masked ball; and the foyer of the ballet is the last place in which two  men so \"knowing\" as M. Debienne and M. Poligny would have made the  mistake of betraying their grief, however genuine it might be.  And  they were already smiling rather too broadly upon Sorelli, who had  begun to recite her speech, when an exclamation from that little madcap  of a Jammes broke the smile of the managers so brutally that the  expression of distress and dismay that lay beneath it became apparent  to all eyes:    \"The Opera ghost!\"    Jammes yelled these words in a tone of unspeakable terror; and her  finger pointed, among the crowd of dandies, to a face so pallid, so  lugubrious and so ugly, with two such deep black cavities under the  straddling eyebrows, that the death's head in question immediately  scored a huge success.    \"The Opera ghost!  The Opera ghost!\"  Everybody laughed and pushed his  neighbor and wanted to offer the Opera ghost a drink, but he was gone.  He had slipped through the crowd; and the others vainly hunted for him,  while two old gentlemen tried to calm little Jammes and while little  Giry stood screaming like a peacock.    Sorelli was furious; she had not been able to finish her speech; the  managers, had kissed her, thanked her and run away as fast as the ghost  himself.  No one was surprised at this, for it was known that they were  to go"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#5)"],[1,"cing.    Maida opened the door leading into the living-room. Then she  squealed her delight, not once, but continuously, like a very happy  little pig.    The room was as changed as if some good fairy had waved a magic wand  there. All the woodwork had turned a glistening white. The wall  paper blossomed with garlands of red roses, tied with snoods of red  ribbons. At each of the three windows waved sash curtains of a snowy  muslin. At each of the three sashes hung a golden cage with a pair  of golden canaries in it. Along each of the three sills marched pots  of brilliantly-blooming scarlet geraniums. A fire spluttered and  sparkled in the fireplace, and drawn up in front of it was a big  easy chair for Granny, and a small easy one for Maida. Familiar  things lay about, too. In one corner gleamed the cheerful face of  the tall old clock which marked the hours with so silvery a voice  and the moon-changes by such pretty pictures. In another corner  shone the polished surface of a spidery-legged little spinet. Maida  loved both these things almost as much as if they had been human  beings, for her mother and her grandmother and her great-grandmother  had loved them before her. Needed things caught her eyes everywhere.  Here was a little bookcase with all her favorite books. There was a  desk, stocked with business-like-looking blank-books. Even the  familiar table with Granny's \"Book of Saints\" stood near the easy  chair. Granny's spectacles lay on an open page, familiarly marking  the place.    In the center of the room stood a table set for three.    \"It's just the dearest place,\" Maida said. \"Billy, you've remembered  everything. I thought I heard a bird peep once, but I was too busy  to think about it.\"    \"Want to go upstairs?\" Billy asked.    \"I'd forgotten all about bedrooms.\" Maida flew up the stairs as if  she had never known a crutch.    The two bedrooms were very simple, all white--woodwork, furniture,  beds, even the fur rugs on the floor. But they were wonderfully gay  from the beautiful paper that Billy had selected. In Granny's room,  the walls imitated a flowered chintz. But in Maida's room every  panel was different. And they all helped to tell the same happy  story of a day's hunting in the time when men wore long feathered  hats on their curls, when ladies dressed like pictures and all  carried falcons on their wrists.    \"Granny, Granny,\" Maida called down to them, \"Did you ever see any  place in all your life that felt so _homey_?\"    \"I guess it will do,\" Billy said in an undertone.    That night, for the first time, Maida slept in the room over the  little shop.                                  CHAPTER III: THE FIRST DAY      If you had gone into the little shop the next day, you would have  seen a very pretty picture.    First of all, I think you would have noticed the little girl who sat  behind the counter--a little girl in a simple blue-serge dress and a  fresh white \"tire\"--a little girl with shining excited eyes and  masses of pale-gold hair, clinging in tendrilly rings about a thin,  heart-shaped face--a little girl who kept saying as she turned round  and round in her swivel-chair:    \"Oh, Granny, do you think _anybody's_ going to buy _anything_  to-day?\"    Next I think you would have noticed an old woman who kept coming to  the living-room door--an old woman in a black gown and a white apron  so stiffly starched that it rattled when it touched anything--an old  woman with twinkling blue eyes and hair, enclosing, as in a silver  frame, a little carved nut of a face--an old woman who kept soothing  the little girl with a cheery:    \"Now joost you be patient, my lamb, sure somebody'll be here soon.\"    The shop was unchanged since yesterday, except for a big bowl of  asters, red, white and blue.    \"Three cheers for the red, white and blue,\" Maida sang when she  arranged them. She had been singing at intervals ever since.  Suddenly the latch slipped. The bell rang.    Maida jumped. Then she sat so still in her high chair that you would  have thought she had turned to stone. But her eyes, glued to the  moving door, had a look as if she did not know what to expect.    The door swung wide. A young man entered. It was Billy Potter.    He walked over to the show case, his hat in his hand. And all the  time he looked Maida straight in the eye. But you would have thought  he had never seen her before.    \"Please, mum,\" he asked humbly, \"do you sell fairy-tales here?\"    Maida saw at once that it was one of Billy's games. She had to bite  her lips to keep from laughing. \"Yes,\" she said, when she had made  her mouth quite firm. \"How much do you want to pay for them?\"    \"Not more than a penny each, mum,\" he replied.    Maida took out of a drawer the pamphlet-tales that Billy had liked  so much.    \"Are these what you want?\" she asked. But before he could answer,  she added in a condescending tone, \"Do you know how to read, little  boy?\"    Billy's face twitched suddenly and his eyes \"skrinkled up.\" Maida  saw with a mischievous delight that he, in his turn, was trying to  keep the laughter back.    \"Yes, mum,\" he said, making his face quite serious again. \"My  teacher says I'm the best reader in the room.\"    He took up the little books and looked them over. \"'The Three  Boars'--no,'Bears,'\" he corrected himself. \"'Puss-in-Boats'--no,  'Boots'; 'Jack-and-the-Bean-Scalp'--no,'Stalk'; 'Jack the  Joint-Cooler'--no, 'Giant-Killer'; 'Cinderella,' 'Bluebird'--no,  'Bluebeard'; 'Little Toody-Goo-Shoes'--no, 'Little Goody-Two-Shoes';  'Tom Thumb,' 'The Sweeping Beauty,'--no, 'The Sleeping Beauty,' 'The  Babes in the Wood.' I guess I'll take these ten, mum.\"    He felt in all his pockets, one after another. After a long time, he  brought out some pennies, \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,  eight, nine, ten,\" he counted slowly.    He took the books, turned and left the shop. Maida watched him in  astonishment. Was he really going for good?    In a few minutes the little bell tinkled a second time and there  stood Billy again.    \"Good morning, Petronilla,\" he said pleasantly, as if he had not  seen her before that morning, \"How's business?\"    \"Fine!\" Maida responded promptly. \"I've just sold ten fairy books to  the funniest little boy you ever saw.\"    \"My stars and garters!\" Billy exclaimed. \"Business surely is brisk.  Keep that up and you can afford to have a cat. I've brought you  something.\"    He opened the bag he carried and took a box out from it. \"Hold out  your two hands,--it's heavy,\" he warned.    In spite of his preparation, the box nearly fell to the floor--it was  so much heavier than Maida expected. \"What can be in it?\" she cried  excitedly. She pulled the cover off--then murmured a little \"oh!\" of  delight.    The box was full--cram-jam full--of pennies; pennies so new that they  looked like gold--pennies so many that they looked like a fortune.    \"Gracious, what pretty money!\" Maida exclaimed. \"There must be a  million here.\"    \"Five hundred,\" Billy corrected her.    He put some tiny cylindrical rolls of paper on the counter. Maida  handled them curiously--they, too, were heavy.    \"Open them,\" Billy commanded.    Maida pulled the papers away from the tops. Bright new dimes fell  out of one, bright new nickels came from the other.    \"Oh, I'm so glad to have nice clean money,\" Maida said in a  satisfied tone. She emptied the money drawer and filled its pockets  with the shining coins. \"It was very kind of you to think of it,  Billy. I know it will please the children.\" The thought made her  eyes sparkle.    The bell rang again. Billy went out to talk with Granny, leaving  Maida alone to cope with her first strange customer.    Again her heart began to jump into her throat. Her mouth felt dry on  the inside. She watched the door, fascinated.    On the threshold two little girls were standing. They were exactly  of the same size, they were dressed in exactly the same way, their  faces were as alike as two peas in a pod. Maida saw at once that  they were twins. They had little round, chubby bodies, bulging out  of red sweaters; little round, chubby faces, emerging from tall,  peaky, red-worsted caps. They had big round eyes as expressionless  as glass beads and big round golden curls as stiff as candles. They  stared so hard at Maida that she began to wonder nervously if her  face were dirty.    \"Come in, little girls,\" she called.    The little girls pattered over to the show case and looked in. But  their big round eyes, instead of examining the candy, kept peering  up through the glass top at Maida. And Maida kept peering down  through it at them.    \"I want to buy some candy for a cent,\" one of them whispered in a  timid little voice.    \"I want to buy some candy for a cent, too,\" the other whispered in a  voice, even more timid.    \"All the cent candy is in this case,\" Maida explained, smiling.    \"What are you going to have, Dorothy?\" one of them asked.    \"I don't know. What are you going to have, Mabel?\" the other  answered. They discussed everything in the one-cent case. Always  they talked in whispers. And they continued to look more often at  Maida than at the candy.    \"Have you anything two-for-a-cent?\" Mabel whispered finally.    \"Oh, yes--all the candy in this corner.\"    The two little girls studied the corner Maida indicated. For two or  three moments they whispered together. At one point, it looked as if  they would each buy a long stick of peppermint, at another, a paper  of lozenges. But they changed their minds a great many times. And in  the end, Dorothy bought two large pickles and Mabel bought two large  chocolates. Maida saw them swapping their purchases as they went  out.    The two pennies which the twins handed her were still moist from the  hot little hands that had held them. Maida dropped them into an  empty pocket in the money drawer. She felt as if she wanted to keep  her first earnings forever. It seemed to her that she had never seen  such "]]]
