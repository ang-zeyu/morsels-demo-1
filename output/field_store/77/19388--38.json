For a few  weeks the chimera buoyed up the Boers, but when nothing more than an  occasional newspaper rumour was heard concerning it the rising in Ashanti  was then looked upon as being the hoped-for boon. The departure of the  three delegates to Europe and America was an encouraging sign to them, and  it was firmly believed that they would be able to induce France, Russia,  or America to offer mediation or intervention. The two Boer newspapers,  the Pretoria _Volksstem_ and the Johannesburg _Standard and Diggers'  News_, dwelt at length upon every favourable token of foreign assistance,  however trifling, and attempted to strengthen hopes which at hardly any  time seemed capable of realisation. It was not until after the war had  been in progress for more than six months that the Boers saw the futility  of placing faith in foreign aid, and afterwards they fought like stronger  men.    The consuls who represented the foreign Governments at Pretoria, and  through whom the Boers made representations for peace, were an  exceptionally able body of men, and their duties were as varied as they  were arduous. The French and German consuls were busied with the care of  the vast mining interests of their countrymen, besides the partial  guardianship of the hundreds of French and German volunteers in the Boer  army. They were called upon to entertain noblemen as well as bankrupts; to  bandage wounds and to bury the dead; to find lost relatives and to care  for widows and orphans. In times of peace the duties of a consul in  Pretoria were not light, but during hostilities they were tenfold heavier.  To the American consul, Adelbert S. Hay, and his associate, John G.  Coolidge, fell more work than to all the others combined. Besides caring  for the American interests in the country, Consul Hay was charged with the  guardianship of the six thousand British prisoners of war in the city as  well as with the care of the financial interests of British citizens.  Every one of the thousands of letters to and from the prisoners was  examined in the American Consulate so that they might carry with them no  breach of neutrality; almost twenty thousand pounds, as well as tons of  luxuries, were distributed by him to the prisoners; while the letters and  cablegrams concerning the health and whereabouts of soldiers which reached  him every week were far in excess of the number of communications which  arrived at the Consulate in a year of peaceful times. Consul Hay was in  good favour with the Boer Government notwithstanding his earnest efforts  to perform his duties with regard to the British prisoners and interests,  and of the many consuls who have represented the United States in South  Africa none performed his duties more intelligently or with more credit to  his country.    One of the most interesting and important events in Pretoria before the  British occupation of the city was the meeting of the Volksraads on May  7th. It was a gathering of the warriors who survived the war which they  themselves had brought about seven months before, and, although the enemy  to whom they had thrown down the gauntlet was at their gates, they were as  resolute and determined as on that October day when they voted to pit the  Boer farmer against the British lion. The seats of many of those who took  part in that memorable meeting were filled with palms and evergreens to  mark the patriots' deaths, but the vierkleur and the cause remained to  spur the living. Generals, commandants, and burghers, no longer in the  grimy costumes of the battlefield, but in the black garb of the  legislator, filled the circles of chairs; bandoliered burghers, consuls  and military attaches in spectacular uniform, business men, and women with  tear-stained cheeks filled the auditorium; while on the official benches  were the heads of departments and the Executive Council, State Secretary  Reitz and General Schalk Burger. The Chairman of the Raad, General Lucas  Meyer, fresh from the battlefield, attracted the attention of the throng  by announcing the arrival of the President. Spectators, Raad members,  officials, all rose to their feet, and Paul Kruger, the Lion of  Rustenberg, the Afrikander captain, entered the Chamber and occupied a  seat of honour.    [Illustration: GENERAL LUCAS J. MEYER]    Grave affairs occupied the attention of the country and there were many  pressing matters to be adjusted, was the burden of the meeting, but the  most important work was the defence of the country, and all the members  were as a unit that their proper places were to be found with the burghers  in the field. There was no talk of ending the war, or of surrender; the  President leading in the proposition to continue hostilities until a  conclusion successful to the Boer cause was attained. \"Shall we lose  courage?\" he demanded. \"Never! Never!! Never!!!\" and then added  reverently: \"May the people and the officers, animated and inspired by a  Higher Power, realising their duty, not only to those brave ones who have  already sacrificed their lives for their Fatherland, but also to posterity  that expects a free country, continue and persevere in this war to the  end.\" With these words of their aged chieftain engraved on their hearts to  strengthen their resolution the members of the Volksraads doffed the garb  of legislators and returned to their commandos to inspire them with new  zeal and determination.    After that memorable meeting of the Volksraads Pretoria again assumed the  appearance of a city of peace, but the rapid approach of the forces of the  enemy soon transformed it into a scene of desperation and panic. Men with  drawn faces dashed through the city to assist their hard-pressed  countrymen in the field; tearful women with children on their arms filled  the churches with their moans and prayers; deserters fleeing homeward  exaggerated fresh disasters and increased the tension of the  populace--tears and terror prevailed almost everywhere. Railway stations  were filled with throngs intent on escaping from the coming disaster,  commandos of breathless and blood-stained burghers entered the city, and  soon the voice of the conquerors' cannon reverberated among the hills and  valleys of the capital. Above the noise and din of the threatened city  rose the calm assurance of Paul Kruger: \"Have good cheer, God will be with  our people in the end.\"          CHAPTER II    FROM FARM TO BATTLEFIELD      In the olden days, before men with strange languages and customs entered  their country and disturbed the serenity of their life, the Boers were  accustomed to make annual trips to the north in search of game, and to  exterminate the lions which periodically attacked their flocks and herds.  It was customary for relatives to form parties, and these trekked with  their long ox-waggons far into the northern Transvaal, and oftentimes into  the wilderness beyond the Zambesi. Women and children accompanied the  expeditions and remained behind in the ox-waggons while the men rode away  into the bush to search for buck, giraffe, and lion. Hardy men and women  these were who braved the dangers of wild beasts and the terrors of the  fever country, yet these treks to the north were as certain annual  functions as the Nachtmaals in the churches. Men who went into the wild  bush to hunt for the lions, which had been their only unconquerable enemy  for years, learned to know no fear, and with their wives and children  formed as hardy a race as virgin soil ever produced. With these pioneers  it was not a matter of great pride to have shot a lion, but it was  considered a disgrace to have missed one. To husband their sparse supplies  of ammunition was their chief object, and to waste a shot by missing the  target was to become the subject of good-natured derision and ridicule.  Fathers, sons, and grandsons entered the bush together, and when there was  a lion or other wild beast to be stalked the amateur hunter was initiated  into the mysteries of backwoodsmanship by his experienced elders.  Consequently the Boers became a nation of proficient lion-hunters, and  efficiently ridded their country of the pest which continually threatened  their safety, the safety of their families and that of their possessions  of live-stock.    In later years, when the foreigner who bought his farms and searched for  the wealth hidden on them became so numerous that the Boer appeared to be  an unwelcome guest in his own house, the old-time lion-hunter had  foundation for believing that a new enemy had suddenly arisen. The Boer  attempted to placate the new enemy by means which failed. Afterward a bold  but unsuccessful inroad was made into the country for the purpose of  relieving him of the necessity of ruling it. Thereupon the old-time  lion-fighting spirit arose within the Boer, and he began to prepare for  future hunting expeditions. He stocked his arsenals with the best guns and  ammunition the world produced, and he secured instructors to teach him the  most modern and approved methods of fighting the new-style lion. He  erected forts and stockades in which he might take refuge in the event  that the lions should prove too strong and numerous, and he made laws and  regulations so that there might be no delay when the proper moment arrived  for attacking the enemy. While these matters were being perfected further  efforts were made to conciliate the enemy, but they proved futile, and it  became evident that the farmer and the lion of 1899 were as implacable  enemies as the farmer and lion of 1850. The lion of 1899 believed his  cause to be as just as did the lion of half a century before, while the  farmer felt that the lion, having been created by Nature, had a just claim  upon Nature and her works for support, but desired that sustenance should  be sought from other parts of Nature's stores. He insisted, moreover,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#5)"],[1,"content myself here with noting a fact, which I  shall deal with more fully in another essay at the end of this book: it  is the decline of musical taste in France--and, I rather think, in all  Europe--since 1835 or 1840. Berlioz says in his _Memoires_: \"Since the  first performance of _Romeo et Juliette_ the indifference of the French  public for all that concerns art and literature has grown incredibly\"  (_Memoires_, II, 263). Compare the shouts of excitement and the tears  that were drawn from the dilettanti of 1830 (_Memoires_, I, 81), at the  performances of Italian operas or Gluck's works, with the coldness of  the public between 1840 and 1870. A mantle of ice covered art then. How  much Berlioz must have suffered. In Germany the great romantic age was  dead. Only Wagner remained to give life to music; and he drained all  that was left in Europe of love and enthusiasm for music. Berlioz died  truly of asphyxia.]    [Footnote 32: Here is an official list of the towns where _Benvenuto_  has been played since 1879 (I am indebted for this information to M.  Victor Chapot, Berlioz's grandnephew). They are, in alphabetical order:  Berlin, Bremen, Brunswick, Dresden, Frankfort-On-Main,  Freiburg-im-Breisgau, Hamburg, Hanover, Karlsruhe, Leipzig, Mannheim,  Metz, Munich, Prague, Schwerin, Stettin, Strasburg, Stuttgart, Vienna,  and Weimar.]    He was the captain of a merchant vessel; a clever, good-hearted boy,  but restless and nervous, irresolute and unhappy, like his father. \"He  has the misfortune to resemble me in everything,\" said Berlioz; \"and we  love each other like a couple of twins.\"[33] \"Ah, my poor Louis,\" he  wrote to him, \"what should I do without you?\" A few months afterwards he  learnt that Louis had died in far-away seas.    He was now alone.[34] There were no more friendly voices; all that he  heard was a hideous duet between loneliness and weariness, sung in his  ear during the bustle of the day and in the silence of the night.[35] He  was wasted with disease. In 1856, at Weimar, following great fatigue, he  was seized with an internal malady. It began with great mental distress;  he used to sleep in the streets. He suffered constantly; he was like \"a  tree without leaves, streaming with rain.\" At the end of 1861, the  disease was in an acute stage. He had attacks of pain sometimes lasting  thirty hours, during which he would writhe in agony in his bed. \"I live  in the midst of my physical pain, overwhelmed with weariness. Death is  very slow.\"[36]    [Footnote 33: _Memoires_, II, 420.]    [Footnote 34: \"I do not know how Berlioz has managed to be cut off like  this. He has neither friends nor followers; neither the warm sun of  popularity nor the pleasant shade of friendship\" (Liszt to the Princess  of Wittgenstein, 16 May, 1861).]    [Footnote 35: In a letter to Bennet he says, \"I am weary, I am  weary....\" How often does this piteous cry sound in his letters towards  the end of his life. \"I feel I am going to die.... I am weary unto  death\" (21 August, 1868--six months before his death).]    [Footnote 36: Letter to Asger Hammerick, 1865.]    Worst of all, in the heart of his misery, there was nothing that  comforted him. He believed in nothing--neither in God nor immortality.         \"I have no faith.... I hate all philosophy and everything that       resembles it, whether religious or otherwise.... I am as incapable       of making a medicine of faith as of having faith in medicine.\"[37]         \"God is stupid and cruel in his complete indifference.\"[38]    He did not believe in beauty or honour, in mankind or himself.         \"Everything passes. Space and time consume beauty, youth, love,       glory, genius. Human life is nothing; death is no better. Worlds       are born and die like ourselves. All is nothing. Yes, yes, yes! All       is nothing.... To love or hate, enjoy or suffer, admire or sneer,       live or die--what does it matter? There is nothing in greatness or       littleness, beauty or ugliness. Eternity is indifferent;       indifference is eternal.\"[39]         \"I am weary of life; and I am forced to see that belief in       absurdities is necessary to human minds, and that it is born in       them as insects are born in swamps.\"[40]    [Footnote 37: Letters to the Princess of Wittgenstein, 22 July, 21  September, 1862; and August, 1864.]    [Footnote 38: _Memoires_, II, 335. He shocked Mendelssohn, and even  Wagner, by his irreligion. (See Berlioz's letter to Wagner, 10  September, 1855.)]    [Footnote 39: _Les Grotesques de la Musique_, pp. 295-6.]    [Footnote 40: Letter to the Abbe Girod. See Hippeau, _Berlioz intime_,  p. 434.]         \"You make me laugh with your old words about a mission to fulfil.       What a missionary! But there is in me an inexplicable mechanism       which works in spite of all arguments; and I let it work because I       cannot stop it. What disgusts me most is the certainty that beauty       does not exist for the majority of these human monkeys.\"[41]         \"The unsolvable enigma of the world, the existence of evil and       pain, the fierce madness of mankind, and the stupid cruelty that it       inflicts hourly and everywhere on the most inoffensive beings and       on itself--all this has reduced me to the state of unhappy and       forlorn resignation of a scorpion surrounded by live coals. The       most I can do is not to wound myself with my own dart.\"[42]         \"I am in my sixty-first year; and I have no more hopes or illusions       or aspirations. I am alone; and my contempt for the stupidity and       dishonesty of men, and my hatred for their wicked cruelty, are at       their height. Every hour I say to Death, 'When you like!' What is       he waiting for?\"[43]    [Footnote 41: Letter to Bennet. He did not believe in patriotism.  \"Patriotism? Fetichism! Cretinism!\" (_Memoires_, II, 261).]    [Footnote 42: Letter to the Princess of Wittgenstein, 22 July, 1862.]    [Footnote 43: _Memoires_, II, 391.]    And yet he fears the death he invites. It is the strongest, the  bitterest, the truest feeling he has. No musician since old Roland de  Lassus has feared it with that intensity. Do you remember Herod's  sleepless nights in _L'Enfance du Christ_, or Faust's soliloquy, or the  anguish of Cassandra, or the burial of Juliette?--through all this you  will find the whispered fear of annihilation. The wretched man was  haunted by this fear, as a letter published by M. Julien Tiersot  shows:--         \"My favourite walk, especially when it is raining, really raining       in torrents, is the cemetery of Montmartre, which is near my house.       I often go there; there is much that draws me to it. The day before       yesterday I passed two hours in the cemetery; I found a comfortable       seat on a costly tomb, and I went to sleep.... Paris is to me a       cemetery and her pavements are tomb-stones. Everywhere are memories       of friends or enemies that are dead.... I do nothing but suffer       unceasing pain and unspeakable weariness. I wonder night and day if       I shall die in great pain or with little of it--I am not foolish       enough to hope to die without any pain at all. Why are we not       dead?\"[44]    His music is like these mournful words; it is perhaps even more  terrible, more gloomy, for it breathes death.[45] What a contrast: a  soul greedy of life and preyed upon by death. It is this that makes his  life such an awful tragedy. When Wagner met Berlioz he heaved a sigh of  relief--he had at last found a man more unhappy than himself.[46]    [Footnote 44: Letters to the Princess of Wittgenstein, 22 January, 1859;  30 August, 1864; 13 July, 1866; and to A. Morel, 21 August, 1864.]    [Footnote 45: \" ... Qui viderit illas          De lacrymis factas sentiet esse meis,\"  wrote Berlioz, as an inscription for his _Tristes_ in 1854.]    [Footnote 46: \"One instantly recognises a companion in misfortune; and I  found I was a happier man than Berlioz\" (Wagner to Liszt, 5 July,  1855).]    On the threshold of death he turned in despair to the one ray of light  left him--_Stella montis_, the inspiration of his childish love;  Estelle, now old, a grandmother, withered by age and grief. He made a  pilgrimage to Meylan, near Grenoble, to see her. He was then sixty-one  years old and she was nearly seventy. \"The past! the past! O Time!  Nevermore! Nevermore!\"[47]    Nevertheless, he loved her, and loved her desperately. How pathetic it  is. One has little inclination to smile when one sees the depths of that  desolate heart. Do you think he did not see, as clearly as you or I  would see, the wrinkled old face, the indifference of age, the \"_triste  raison_,\" in her he idealised? Remember, he was the most ironical of  men. But he did not wish to see these things, he wished to cling to a  little love, which would help him to live in the wilderness of life.         \"There is nothing real in this world but that which lives in the       heart.... My life has been wrapped up in the obscure little village       where she lives.... Life is only endurable when I tell myself:       'This autumn I shall spend a month beside her.' I should die in       this hell of a Paris if she did not allow me to write to her, and       if from time to time I had not letters from her.\"    So he spoke to Legouve; and he sat down on a stone in a Paris street,  and wept. In the meantime, the old lady did not understand this  foolishness; she hardly tolerated it, and sought to undeceive him.    [Footnote 47: _Memoires_, II, 396.]         \"When one's hair is white one must leave dreams--even those of       friendship.... Of what use is it to form ties which, though they       hold to-day, may break to-morrow?\"    What were his dreams? To live with her? No; rather to die beside her; to  feel she was by his side when death should come.         \"To be at your feet, my head on your knees, your two hands in       mine--so to finish.\"[48]    He was a little "]]]
