Ants, for example, are a respectable race living  in well-ordered communities. They have attained to a most complex and  artificial civilization, and will frequently adventure far afield on  colonising or other expeditions from whence they return with a rich  booty of aphides and other stock, who thenceforward become the servants  and domestic creatures of the republic. As they neither kill nor eat  their captives, this practice will be termed kidnapping. The same may  be said of bees, a hardy and industrious race living in hexagonal cells  which are very difficult to make. Sometimes, on lacking a queen of  their own, they have been observed to abduct one from a less powerful  neighbour, and use her for their own purposes without shame, mercy, or  remorse.\"    \"Will you not understand?\" screamed the Thin Woman.    \"I will not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Semi-tropical apes have been  rumoured to kidnap children, and are reported to use them very tenderly  indeed, sharing their coconuts, yams, plantains, and other equatorial  provender with the largest generosity, and conveying their delicate  captives from tree to tree (often at great distances from each other and  from the ground) with the most guarded solicitude and benevolence.\"    \"I am going to bed,\" said the Thin Woman, \"your stirabout is on the  hob.\"    \"Are there lumps in it, my dear?\" said the Philosopher.    \"I hope there are,\" replied the Thin Woman, and she leaped into bed.    That night the Philosopher was afflicted with the most extraordinary  attack of rheumatism he had ever known, nor did he get any ease until  the grey morning wearied his lady into a reluctant slumber.        CHAPTER VI    THE Thin Woman of Inis Magrath slept very late that morning, but when  she did awaken her impatience was so urgent that she could scarcely  delay to eat her breakfast. Immediately after she had eaten she put on  her bonnet and shawl and went through the pine wood in the direction of  Gort na Cloca Mora. In a short time she reached the rocky field, and,  walking over to the tree in the southeast corner, she picked up a small  stone and hammered loudly against the trunk of the tree. She hammered  in a peculiar fashion, giving two knocks and then three knocks, and then  one knock. A voice came up from the hole.    \"Who is that, please?\" said the voice.    \"Ban na Droid of Inis Magrath, and well you know it,\" was her reply.    \"I am coming up, Noble Woman,\" said the voice, and in another moment the  Leprecaun leaped out of the hole.    \"Where are Seumas and Brigid Beg?\" said the Thin Woman sternly.    \"How would I know where they are?\" replied the Leprecaun. \"Wouldn't they  be at home now?\"    \"If they were at home I wouldn't have come here looking for them,\" was  her reply. \"It is my belief that you have them.\"    \"Search me,\" said the Leprecaun, opening his waistcoat.    \"They are down there in your little house,\" said the Thin Woman angrily,  \"and the sooner you let them up the better it will be for yourself and  your five brothers.\"    \"Noble Woman,\" said the Leprecaun, \"you can go down yourself into our  little house and look. I can't say fairer than that.\"    \"I wouldn't fit down there,\" said she. \"I'm too big.\"    \"You know the way for making yourself little,\" replied the Leprecaun.    \"But I mightn't be able to make myself big again,\" said the Thin Woman,  \"and then you and your dirty brothers would have it all your own way. If  you don't let the children up,\" she continued, \"I'll raise the Shee of  Croghan Conghaile against you. You know what happened to the Cluricauns  of Oilean na Glas when they stole the Queen's baby--It will be a worse  thing than that for you. If the children are not back in my house before  moonrise this night, I'll go round to my people. Just tell that to your  five ugly brothers. Health with you,\" she added, and strode away.    \"Health with yourself, Noble Woman,\" said the Leprecaun, and he stood on  one leg until she was out of sight and then he slid down into the hole  again.    When the Thin Woman was going back through the pine wood she saw Meehawl  MacMurrachu travelling in the same direction and his brows were in a  tangle of perplexity.    \"God be with you, Meehawl MacMurrachu,\" said she.    \"God and Mary be with you, ma'am,\" he replied, \"I am in great trouble  this day.\"    \"Why wouldn't you be?\" said the Thin Woman.    \"I came up to have a talk with your husband about a particular thing.\"    \"If it's talk you want you have come to a good house, Meehawl.\"    \"He's a powerful man right enough,\" said Meehawl.    After a few minutes the Thin Woman spoke again. \"I can get the reek of  his pipe from here. Let you go right in to him now and I'll stay outside  for a while, for the sound of your two voices would give me a pain in my  head.\"    \"Whatever will please you will please me, ma'am,\" said her companion,  and he went into the little house.    Meehawl MacMurrachu had good reason to be perplexed. He was the father  of one child only, and she was the most beautiful girl in the whole  world. The pity of it was that no one at all knew she was beautiful, and  she did not even know it herself. At times when she bathed in the eddy  of a mountain stream and saw her reflection looking up from the placid  water she thought that she looked very nice, and then a great sadness  would come upon her, for what is the use of looking nice if there is  nobody to see one's beauty? Beauty, also, is usefulness. The arts as  well as the crafts, the graces equally with the utilities must stand up  in the marketplace and be judged by the gombeen men.    The only house near to her father's was that occupied by Bessie  Hannigan. The other few houses were scattered widely with long, quiet  miles of hill and bog between them, so that she had hardly seen more  than a couple of men beside her father since she was born. She helped  her father and mother in all the small businesses of their house, and  every day also she drove their three cows and two goats to pasture on  the mountain slopes. Here through the sunny days the years had passed  in a slow, warm thoughtlessness wherein, without thinking, many thoughts  had entered into her mind and many pictures hung for a moment like  birds in the thin air. At first, and for a long time, she had been happy  enough; there were many things in which a child might be interested:  the spacious heavens which never wore the same beauty on any day; the  innumerable little creatures living among the grasses or in the heather;  the steep swing of a bird down from the mountain to the infinite plains  below; the little flowers which were so contented each in its peaceful  place; the bees gathering food for their houses, and the stout beetles  who are always losing their way in the dusk. These things, and many  others, interested her. The three cows after they had grazed for a long  time would come and lie by her side and look at her as they chewed their  cud, and the goats would prance from the bracken to push their heads  against her breast because they loved her.    Indeed, everything in her quiet world loved this girl: but very slowly  there was growing in her consciousness an unrest, a disquietude to  which she had hitherto been a stranger. Sometimes an infinite weariness  oppressed her to the earth. A thought was born in her mind and it had  no name. It was growing and could not be expressed. She had no words  wherewith to meet it, to exorcise or greet this stranger who, more and  more insistently and pleadingly, tapped upon her doors and begged to  be spoken to, admitted and caressed and nourished. A thought is a real  thing and words are only its raiment, but a thought is as shy as a  virgin; unless it is fittingly apparelled we may not look on its shadowy  nakedness: it will fly from us and only return again in the darkness  crying in a thin, childish voice which we may not comprehend until, with  aching minds, listening and divining, we at last fashion for it those  symbols which are its protection and its banner. So she could not  understand the touch that came to her from afar and yet how intimately,  the whisper so aloof and yet so thrillingly personal. The standard of  either language or experience was not hers; she could listen but not  think, she could feel but not know, her eyes looked forward and did not  see, her hands groped in the sunlight and felt nothing. It was like the  edge of a little wind which stirred her tresses but could not lift them,  or the first white peep of the dawn which is neither light nor darkness.  But she listened, not with her ears but with her blood. The fingers of  her soul stretched out to clasp a stranger's hand, and her disquietude  was quickened through with an eagerness which was neither physical nor  mental, for neither her body nor her mind was definitely interested.  Some dim region between these grew alarmed and watched and waited and  did not sleep or grow weary at all.    One morning she lay among the long, warm grasses. She watched a bird who  soared and sang for a little time, and then it sped swiftly away down  the steep air and out of sight in the blue distance. Even when it was  gone the song seemed to ring in her ears. It seemed to linger with her  as a faint, sweet echo, coming fitfully, with little pauses as though a  wind disturbed it, and careless, distant eddies. After a few moments she  knew it was not a bird. No bird's song had that consecutive melody, for  their themes are as careless as their wings. She sat up and looked about  her, but there was nothing in sight: the mountains sloped gently above  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16059"],[0,"Modern Spanish Lyrics (#5)"],[1," MORATIN (1737-1780) followed the  French rules in theory and wrote a few mediocre plays in  accordance with them; but he showed that at heart he was a  good poet and a good Spaniard by his ode _A Pedro  Romero, torero insigne_, some _romances_ and his famous  _quintillas_, the _Fiesta de toros en Madrid_. Other  followers of the French, in a genre not, strictly  speaking, lyric at all, were the two fabulists, Samaniego  and Iriarte. F. Maria de SAMANIEGO (1745-1801) gave to the  traditional stock of apologues, as developed by Phaedrus,  Lokman and La Fontaine, a permanent and popular Castilian  form. Tomas de IRIARTE (1750-1791), a more irritable  personage who spent much time in literary polemics, wrote  original fables (_Fabulas literarias_, 1781) directed not  against the foibles of mankind in general, but against the  world of writers and scholars.    The best work which was done under the classical French  influence, however, is to be found in the writers of the  so-called Salamancan school, which was properly not a  school at all. The poets who are thus classed together,  Cadalso, Diego Gonzalez, Jovellanos, Forner, Melendez  Valdes, Cienfuegos, Iglesias, were personal friends thrown  together in the university or town of Salamanca, but they  were not subjected to a uniform literary training and  possessed no similarity of style or aim as did the men of  the later Sevillan school.    Jose de CADALSO (1741-1782), a dashing soldier of great  personal charm killed at the siege of Gibraltar, is  sometimes credited with founding the school of Salamanca.  He was a friend of most of the important writers of his  time and composed interesting prose satires; his verse  (_Noches lugubres_, etc.) is not remarkable. FRAY DIEGO  GONZALEZ (1733-1794) is one of the masters of                  page xxx  idiomatic Castilian in the century. He admired Luis de  Leon and imitated him in paraphrases of the Psalms. The  volume of his verse is small but unsurpassed in surety of  taste and evenness of finish. The _Murcielago alevoso_ has  passed into many editions and become a favorite in Spain.  The pure and commanding figure of JOVELLANOS (1744-1811)  dominated the whole group which listened to his advice  with respect. It was not always sure, for he led Diego  Gonzalez and Melendez Valdes astray by persuading them to  attempt philosophical poetry instead of the lighter sort  for which they were fitted. He was in fact a greater man  than poet, but his satires and _Epistola al duque de  Veragua_ are strong and dignified.    Juan MELENDEZ VALDES (1754-1817) was on the contrary a  greater poet than man. Brilliant from the first, he was  petted by Cadalso and Jovellanos who strove to develop his  talent. In 1780 he won a prize offered by the Academy for  an eclogue. In 1784 his comedy _Las bodas de Camacho_, on  a subject suggested by Jovellanos (from an episode in _Don  Quijote_, II, 19-21), won a prize offered by the city of  Madrid, but failed on the stage. His first volume of poems  was published in 1785; later editions appeared in 1797 and  1820. He attached himself to the French party at the time  of the invasion in 1808, incurred great popular odium and  died in France. He is the most fluent, imaginative poet of  the eighteenth century and is especially successful in the  pastoral and anacreontic styles. Fresh descriptions of  nature, enchanting pictures of love, form an oasis in  an age of studied reasonableness. His language has been  criticized for its Gallicisms. Jose IGLESIAS DE LA CASA  (1748-1791), a native of Salamanca and a priest, wrote  much light satirical verse, epigrams, parodies                page xxxi  and _letrillas_ in racy Castilian; he was less successful  in the graver forms. Nicasio ALVAREZ DE CIENFUEGOS  (1764-1809) passes as a disciple of Melendez; he was a  passionate, uneven writer whose undisciplined thought and  habit of coining words lead to obscurity. Politically he  opposed the French with unyielding vigor, barely escaped  execution at their hands and died in exile. The verse of  Cienfuegos prepared the way for Quintana. Differing  from him in clarity and polish are Fr. Sanchez Barbero  (1764-1819) and Leandro F. de Moratin, the dramatist  (1760-1828).    One curious result of rationalistic doctrines was the  \"prosaism\" into which it led many minor versifiers. These  poetasters, afraid of overstepping the limits of  good sense, tabooed all imagination and described in  deliberately prosy lines the most commonplace events. The  movement reached its height at the beginning of the reign  of Charles IV (1788-1808) and produced such efforts as  a poem to the gout, a nature-poem depicting barn-yard  sounds, and even Iriarte's _La musica_ (1780), in which  one may read in carefully constructed _silvas_ the  definition of diatonic and chromatic scales.                                  II          SPANISH LYRIC POETRY OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY      Early in the nineteenth century the armies of Napoleon  invaded Spain. There ensued a fierce struggle for the  mastery of the Peninsula, in which the latent strength and  energy of the Spaniards became once more evident. The        page xxxii  French devastated parts of the country, but they  brought with them many new ideas which, together with the  sharpness of the conflict, served to awaken the Spanish  people from their torpor and to give them a new  realization of national consciousness. During this period  of stress and strife two poets, Quintana and Gallego,  urged on and encouraged their fellow countrymen with  patriotic songs.    Manuel Jose QUINTANA (1772-1857) had preeminently the  \"gift of martial music,\" and great was the influence  of his odes _Al armamento de las provincias contra los  franceses_ and _A Espana despues de la revolucion de  marzo_. He also strengthened the patriotism of his people  by his prose _Vidas de espanoles celebres_ (begun in  1806): the Cid, the Great Captain (Gonzalo de Cordoba),  Pizarro and others of their kind. In part a follower  of the French philosophers of the eighteenth century,  Quintana sang also of humanity and progress, as in his ode  on the invention of printing. In politics Quintana was a  liberal; in religious beliefs, a materialist. Campoamor  has said of Quintana that he sang not of faith or  pleasures, but of duties. His enemies have accused him  of stirring the colonies to revolt by his bitter sarcasm  directed at past and contemporaneous Spanish rulers, but  this is doubtless an exaggeration. It may be said that  except in his best patriotic poems his verses lack lyric  merit and his ideas are wanting in insight and depth; but  his sincerity of purpose was in the main beyond question  and he occasionally gave expression to striking boldness  of thought and exaltation of feeling. In technique  Quintana was a follower of the Salamancan school.    The cleric Juan Nicasio GALLEGO (1777-1853) rivaled  Quintana as a writer of patriotic verses. A liberal in  politics like Quintana, Gallego also took the               page xxxiii  side of his people against the French invaders and against  the servile Spanish rulers. He is best known by the ode  _El dos de mayo_, in which he exults over the rising of  the Spanish against the French on the second of May,  1808; the ode _A la defensa de Buenos Aires_ against the  English; and the elegy _A la muerte de la duquesa de  Frias_ in which he shows that he is capable of deep  feeling. Gallego was a close friend of Quintana, whose  salon in Madrid he frequented. Gallego wrote little, but  his works are more correct in language and style than  those of Quintana. It is interesting that although the  writings of these two poets evince a profound dislike and  distrust of the French, yet both were in their art largely  dominated by the influence of French neo-classicism. This  is but another illustration of the relative conservatism  of belles-lettres.    In the year 1793 there had been formed in Seville by a  group of young writers an Academia de Letras Humanas to  foster the cultivation of letters. The members of this  academy were admirers of Herrera, the Spanish Petrarchist  and patriotic poet of the sixteenth century, and they  strove for a continuation of the tradition of the earlier  Sevillan group. The more important writers of the later  Sevillan school were Arjona, Blanco, Lista and Reinoso.  Manuel Maria de ARJONA (1771-1820), a priest well read in  the Greek and Latin classics, was an imitator of Horace.  Jose Maria BLANCO (1775-1841), known in the history of  English literature as Blanco White, spent much time in  England and wrote in English as well as in Castilian.  Ordained a Catholic priest he later became an Unitarian.  The best-known and most influential writer of the group  was Alberto LISTA (1775-1848), an educator and               page xxxiv  later canon of Seville. Lista was a skilful artist and  like Arjona an admirer and imitator of Horace; but his  ideas lacked depth. His best-known poem is probably a  religious one, _A la muerte de Jesus,_ which abounds in  true poetic feeling. Lista exerted great influence as a  teacher and his _Lecciones de literatura espanola_ did  much to stimulate the study of Spanish letters. Felix Jose  REINOSO (1772-1814), also a priest, imitated Milton in  _octava rima_. As a whole the influence of the Sevillan  school was healthful. By insisting upon purity of diction  and regularity in versification, the members of the school  helped somewhat to restrain the license and improve the  bad taste prevailing in the Spanish literature of the  time. The Catalonian Manuel de CABANYES (1808-1833)  remained unaffected by the warring literary schools and  followed with passionate enthusiasm the precepts of the  ancients and particularly of Horace.    In the third decade of the nineteenth century romanticism,  with its revolt against the restrictions of classicism,  with its free play of imagination and emotion, and with"]]]
