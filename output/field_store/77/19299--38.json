He carried  it bodily into Cotton's room, and then returned with his friend's  mahogany, which was undoubtedly more ornamental than his own.    Acton was absolutely right when he sneeringly called Gus \"Cotton's  jackal.\" Todd was exactly of the material which makes a good jackal,  though he never became quite Jim Cotton's toady. He was a sharp, selfish  individual, good-looking in an aimless kind of way, with a slack, feeble  mouth, and a wandering, indecisive glance. He had a quick, shallow  cleverness, which could get up pretty easily enough of inexact knowledge  to pass muster in the schools. Old Corker knew his capabilities to a hair,  and would now and then, when Gus offered up some hazy, specious  guess-work, blister him with a little biting sarcasm. Todd feared the  Doctor as he feared no one else. Todd's chief private moan was that he  never had any money. His father was a rich man, but had some ideas which  were rather rough on his weak-kneed son. He tipped poor Gus as though he  were some thrifty hairdresser's son, and Todd had to try to ruffle it with  young Amorians on as many shillings as they had crowns. Not a lad who ever  had naturally any large amount of self-respect, the little he had soon  went, and he became, while still a fag, a hewer of wood and drawer of  water to his better-tipped cronies. His destiny finished when, on his  entry into the Fifth, Jim Cotton claimed him, and subsidized him as his  man.    At the beginning of the term his father had told him that if he could make  a good show in the Perry Exhibition there need not be any more grumbling  about his tip. Gus came back to St. Amory's hysterically anxious to cut  out all competitors for the Perry, but the shackles of his old serfdom  were still about him. When he showed signs of being restive to the old  claims, and recommended Cotton to do his own classics and mathematics,  Cotton coolly and calmly demanded repayment of sundry loans contracted of  old. Todd had not the pluck to face a term of plain living and high  thinking by paying his former patron all he owed him and exhausting all  his present tip by so doing, but flabbily, though discontentedly, caved  in, and became Cotton's jackal as before.    Cotton was by no means as bad as his endearing name might make you think.  He was a tall, heavy fellow, with a large, determined-looking face. He was  wonderfully stupid in the schools, but was quite clever enough to know it.  He had some good qualities. He was straight enough in all extra-school  affairs, did not lie, nor fear any one; kept his word, and expected you to  keep yours.    \"You can't beat Hodgson of the Sixth, Gus, so what is the good of sweating  all the term? Hodgson's got the deuce of a pull over you to start with.\"    \"I'm not frightened of Hodgson if you wouldn't bother, Jim.\"    \"Can't do without you, old cock. You're just the fellow to lift my Latin  and those filthy mathematics high enough out of the mud to keep the beaks  from worrying me to death. I tried Philips for a week, but he did such  weird screeds in the 'unseens' that Merishall smelt a rat, and was most  particular attentive to me, but your leverage is just about my fighting  weight.\"    Gus had sniffed discontentedly at this dubious compliment; but Cotton had  smiled stolidly, and continued to use Gus as his classical and  mathematical hack. Besides, there was something about Gus's easy-going  lackadaisical temperament which exactly suited Cotton, and he felt for his  grumbling jackal a friendliness apart from Gus's usefulness to him.    This afternoon had been a fair sample of Todd's usual half-holiday.  Feeling no heart for any serious work for the Perry, he had spent it in  reading half a worthless novel, and skimming through a magazine, and  feeling muddled and discontented in consequence. He had the uneasy feeling  that he was an arrant ass in thus fooling time away, but had not  sufficient self-denial to seize upon a quiet afternoon for a little  genuine work.    Cotton soon returned from his bath, and the two cronies spent about an  hour in getting up the least modicum of their classics which would satisfy  Merishall; and then they played chess, by which Gus was one florin richer.  A third game was in progress, but Todd managed to tip over the board when  he was \"going to mate in five moves.\" Cotton thereupon said he had had  enough, but Gus avariciously tried to reconstruct the positions. He failed  dismally, and Cotton laughed sweetly. Now Cotton's laugh would almost make  his chum's hair curl, so he retorted pretty sweetly himself, \"I say, Jim.  I can't get out of my head that awful hammering you fellows got this  afternoon. Think Biffen's lot likely to shape well in the House matches?\"    \"There's no telling, old man. But if they get moderate luck they'll be  waltzing about in the final.\"    \"That's absolute blazing idiocy!\" said Todd, knocking over more chessmen  in his astonishment.    \"All right, Gus. To talk absolute blazing idiocy is my usual habit, of  course. They may carry off the final even, but that, perhaps, is a tall  order.\"    Todd nursed his astonishment for a full five minutes, whistling  occasionally, as at some very fantastic idea. At last he said more  seriously: \"Aren't you now, Jim, really pulling my leg?\"    \"No, honour bright! Biffen's are really eye-openers.\"    Gus said with infinite slyness: \"Look here, I'll bet you evens Biffen's  _don't_ pull off the final.\"    \"Oh, that is rot, Gus, to talk about betting, for you can't pay if you  lose.\"    Gus had not too much sensitiveness in his character, but this unmeant  insult stung him.    \"You've no right to say that. I've paid all I've ever betted with you.\"    Cotton considered heavily in his own mind for a moment. \"That is almost  true, but--\"    \"Well, what do you mean--\" began Todd, in a paddy.    \"All right,\" said Cotton; \"shut up, confound you! I'll take you.\"    \"Three quid Biffen's are not cock-house at 'footer.'\"    \"Done,\" said Cotton, unwillingly pulling out his note-book; \"and straight,  Todd, I shall expect you to pay if you lose.\"    \"Oh, shut up, Cotton, you cad! I shall pay if I lose, man. What do you  want to keep on insulting me like that for?\"    \"Steady, Gus. You'll have Taylor up if you howl like that. I meant  nothing.\"    \"Nothing!\" said Gus in a fury, seeking for something particularly sweet to  say to his patron. \"I jolly well hope, then, that if our house should meet  'em in the rounds you will do your little best to put a stopper on their  career. Don't, for the sake of pulling off your bet, present 'em with a  few goals. You 'keep' for our house, you know.\"    \"Oh, dash it all, Todd,\" said Cotton, in a white rage, \"you are a bounder!  Think I'd sell my side?\" he demanded furiously.    \"Ah!\" said Gus, delighted at having got through Cotton's skin. \"You don't  stomach insults any more than I do. Then why do you ladle them out so  jolly freely to me?\"    \"That was a particularly low one,\" said Cotton angrily; \"and anyway, you  avaricious beggar, you've got thundering good terms, for it is hardly  likely that Biffen's can really be cock-house. There's Corker's house,  with Bourne and Hodgson and a few more good men. You're a sight more  likely to see my three sovs, that I am yours.\"    \"I hope so,\" said Gus, with some relief at the anticipation of this  pleasant prospect.    Then the anger of the two simmered down, each having given and received  some very choice compliments, and as these little breezes were usual  between the two, ten minutes afterwards they were amiably entertaining  each other. Cotton was putting up a pair of dumb-bells three hundred  times, and his crony was counting and criticising his form. The Perry  Exhibition did not enter Todd's head, but his bet--\"such a gilt-edged  one,\" he chuckled--was never once out of it. And Todd's bet had some  momentous consequences for him, too.          CHAPTER VI    THE LAST CAP      While Acton was thus making such strenuous exertions to lift Biffen's out  of the mire, Bourne was finding out the whole unpainted beauty of the  situation--as far as it concerned himself.    The experimental footer elevens were chosen in what, I believe, is the  usual manner. The old members of the school eleven formed a committee, and  chose fellows to play in the weekly matches, and if any one of them showed  special talent he was, of course, retained, and by-and-by the captain gave  him his school cap, and he was henceforth a full-blown member of the  eleven, with a seat on the committee like any of the old gang.    There were left of the last year's team five players--Bourne, Mivart,  Vercoe, Baines, and Roberts. The final promotion of fellows into the  eleven, however, rested with the captain alone, and when he considered any  fellow good enough he signified the same by presenting him with the blue  and silver cap of St. Amory.    The giving away of a cap had become quite a function. Whenever there was  the rumour that some one was to have a cap after a match, pretty well the  whole school swarmed round the pavilion, and when the new member came out  in all the glory of his new blue and silver he got the cheers which his  play or popularity deserved, and especially did the new member's house  distinguish themselves in the shouting.    Thus Bourne had six caps at his disposal, and since \"Socker\" had been  introduced, the last cap was always given so that when the school played  the last match--the Carthusians--the eleven would be complete.    Bourne saw at once the cloud which was rising on the horizon when, at the  first committee meeting to choose the eleven against \"The Cognoscenti\"  Mivart said, \"Well, Bourne, we've got your partner for to-morrow ready  made. I think we may put that new chap Acton down right"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14776"],[0,"The Arabian Art of Taming and Training Wild & Vicious Horses (#5)"],[1,"at your hand, not that he has any preference for  your hand, but because that it is projecting, and is the nearest portion  of your body to the horse. This all colts will do, and they will smell of  your naked hand just as quick as they will of any thing that you can put  in it, and with just as good an effect, however much some men have  preached the doctrine of taming horses by giving them the scent articles  from the hand. I have already proved that to be a mistake. As soon as he  touches his nose to your hand, caress him as before directed, always using  a very light, soft hand, merely touching the horse, all ways rubbing the  way the hair lays, so that your hand will pass along as smoothly as  possible. As you stand by his side you may find it more convenient to rub  his neck or the side of his head, which will answer the same purpose, as  rubbing his forehead. Favor every inclination of the horse to smell or  touch you with his nose. Always follow each touch or communication of this  kind with the most tender and affectionate caresses, accompanied with a  kind look, and pleasant word of some sort, such as: Ho! my little boy, ho!  my little boy, pretty boy, nice lady! or something of that kind,  constantly repeating the same words, with the same kind, steady tone of  voice; for the horse soon learns to read the expression of the face and  voice, and will know as well when fear, love or anger, prevails as you  know your own feelings; two of which, _fear and anger_, a good horseman  _should never feel_.      HOW TO PROCEED IF YOUR HORSE IS OF A STUBBORN DISPOSITION.    If your horse, instead of being wild, seems to be of a stubborn or  _mulish_ disposition; if he lays back his ears as you approach him, or  turns his heels to kick you, he has not that regard or fear of man that he  should have, to enable you to handle him quickly and easily; and it might  be well to give him a few sharp cuts with the whip, about the legs, pretty  close to the body. It will crack keen as it plies around his legs, and the  crack of the whip will affect him as much as the stroke; besides one sharp  cut about his legs will affect him more than two or three over his back,  the skin on the inner part of his legs or about his flank being thinner,  more tender than on his back. But do not whip him much, just enough to  scare him, it is not because we want to hurt the horse that we whip him,  we only do it to scare that bad disposition out of him. But whatever you  do, do quickly, sharply and with a good deal of fire, but always without  anger. If you are going to scare him at all you must do it at once. Never  go into a pitch battle with your horse, and whip him until he is mad and  will fight you; you had better not touch him at all, for you will  establish, instead of fear and regard, feelings of resentment, hatred and  ill-will. It will do him no good but an injury, to strike a blow, unless  you can scare him; but if you succeed in scaring him, you can whip him  without making him mad; for fear and anger never exist together in the  horse, and as soon as one is visible, you will find that the other has  disappeared. As soon as you have frightened him so that he will stand up  straight and pay some attention to you, approach him again and caress him  a good deal more than you whipped him, then you will excite the two  controlling passions of his nature, love and fear, and then he will fear  and love you too, and as soon as he learns what to do will quickly obey.      HOW TO HALTER AND LEAD THE COLT.    As soon as you have gentled the colt a little, take the halter in your  left hand and approach him as before, and on the same side that you have  gentled him. If he is very timid about your approaching closely to him,  you can get up to him quicker by making the whip a part of your arm, and  reaching out very gently with the but end of it, rubbing him lightly on  the neck, all the time getting a little closer, shortening the whip by  taking it up in your hand, until you finally get close enough to put your  hands on him. If he is inclined to hold his head from you, put the end of  the halter strap around his neck, drop your whip, and draw very gently; he  will let his neck give, and you can pull his head to you. Then take hold  of that part of the halter, which buckles over the top of his head, and  pass the long side, or that part which goes into the buckle, under his  neck, grasping it on the opposite side with your right hand, letting the  first strap loose--the latter will be sufficient to hold his head to you.  Lower the halter a little, just enough to get his nose into that part  which goes around it, then raise it somewhat, and fasten the top buckle,  and you will have it all right. The first time you halter a colt you  should stand on the left side, pretty well back to his shoulder only  taking hold of that part of the halter that goes around his neck, then  with your hands about his neck you can hold his head to you, and raise the  halter on it without making him dodge by putting your hands about his  nose. You should have a long rope or strap ready, and as soon as you have  the halter on, attach this to it, so that you can let him walk the length  of the stable without letting go of the strap, or without making him pull  on the halter, for if you only let him feel the weight of your hand on the  halter, and give him rope when he runs from you, he will never rear, pull,  or throw himself, yet you will be holding him all the time, and doing more  towards gentling him, than if you had the power to snub him right up, and  hold him to one spot; because, he does not know any thing about his  strength, and if you don't do any thing to make him pull, he will never  know that he can. In a few minutes you can begin to control him with the  halter, then shorten the distance between yourself and the horse, by  taking up the strap in your hand.    As soon as he will allow you to hold him by a tolerably short strap, and  step up to him without flying back, you can begin to give him some idea  about leading. But to do this, do not go before and attempt to pull him  after you, but commence by pulling him very quietly to one side. He has  nothing to brace either side of his neck, and will soon yield to a steady,  gradual pull of the halter; and as soon as you have pulled him a step or  two to one side, step up to him and caress him, and then pull him again,  repeating this operation until you can pull him around in every direction,  and walk about the stable with him, which you can do in a few minutes, for  he will soon think when you have made him step to the right or left a few  times, that he is compelled to follow the pull of the halter, not knowing  that he has the power to resist your pulling; besides, you have handled  him so gently, that he is not afraid of you, and you always caress him  when he comes up to you, and he likes that, and would just as leave follow  you as not. And after he has had a few lessons of that kind, if you turn  him out in a lot he will come up to you every opportunity he gets. You  should lead him about in the stable some time before you take him out,  opening the door, so that he can see out, leading him up to it and back  again, and past it. See that there is nothing on the outside to make him  jump, when you take him out, and as you go out with him, try to make him  go very slowly, catching hold of the halter close to the jaw, with your  left hand, while the right is resting on the top of the neck, holding to  his mane. After you are out with him a little while, you can lead him  about as you please. Don't let any second person come up to you when you  first take him out; a stranger taking hold of the halter would frighten  him, and make him run. There should not even be any one standing near him  to attract his attention, or scare him. If you are alone, and manage him  right, it will not require any more force to lead or hold him than it  would to manage a broke horse.      HOW TO LEAD A COLT BY THE SIDE OF A BROKEN HORSE.    If you should want to lead your colt by the side of another horse, as is  often the case, I would advise you to take your horse into the stable,  attach a second strap to the colt's halter, and lead your horse up  alongside of him. Then get on the broke horse and take one strap around  his breast, under his martingale, (if he has any on,) holding it in your  left hand. This will prevent the colt from getting back too far; besides,  you will have more power to hold him, with the strap pulling against the  horse's breast. The other strap take up in your right hand to prevent him  from running ahead; then turn him about a few times in the stable, and if  the door is wide enough, ride out with him in that position; if not, take  the broke horse out first, and stand his breast up against the door, then  lead the colt to the same spot, and take the straps as before directed,  one on each side of his neck, then let some one start the colt out, and as  he comes out, turn your horse to the left, and you will have them all  right. This is the best way to lead a colt; you can manage any kind of a  colt in this way, without any trouble; for, if he tries to run ahead, or  pull back, the two straps will bring the horses facing each other, so that  you can easily follow up his movements without doing much holding, and as  soon as he stops running backward you are right with him, and all ready to  go ahead. And if he gets stubborn and does not want to go, you can remove  all his stubbornness by riding your horse against his neck, thus  compelling him to turn to the right, and as soon as you have turned him  about a few times, he will be willing to go along. The next thing, after  you are through leading him, will be to take him into a stable, and hitch  him in such a way as not to have him pull on the halter, and as they are  often troublesome to get into a stable the first few times, I will "]]]
