I have suffered so much from  the lack of that which my father could easily have given me in youth,  and which he himself possessed, that I am all the more anxious you  shall escape my punishment in that respect; that you may not, like me,  dream of those advantages which others enjoy through any lack of  opportunity or neglect of mine.  Therefore, learn to love your Latin,  your French, and your English grammar; standing firmly and securely on  them, you have a solid foothold in the field of literature....    Think how interesting it will be hereafter to refer to your journal,  and see the rapid development, not only of your mind, but of your  moral growth; only do not fail to record all your shortcomings; they  will not stand as reproaches, but as mere snags in the tortuous river  of your life, to be avoided in succeeding trips farther down the  stream.  They beset us all along the route, from the cradle to the  grave, and if we can only see them we can avoid many rough bumps.    God bless my darling!    PAPA.        TO HIS DAUGHTER    CHICAGO, October 9, 1886    ...  I am glad to know that baby has begun to crawl; don't put her on  her feet too soon; consider her legs a _la bow_....  I closed my first  week here with two enormous houses.  A hard week's work has greatly  tired me....  Jefferson called and left with me the manuscript of his  reminiscences, which he has been writing.  So far as he has written  it, it is intensely interesting and amusing, and well written in a  free and chatty style; it will be the best autobiography of any actor  yet published if he continues it in its present form.  I sent you some  book notices from Lawrence Hutton's clippings for me....  In the  article I send to-day you will see that I am gently touched up on the  point of the \"old school\"; my reference was not to the old style of  acting, but the old stock theatre as a school--where a beginner had  the advantage of a great variety of experience in farces, as well as  tragedies and comedies, and a frequent change of programme.  There is  no \"school\" now; there is a more natural style of acting, perhaps, but  the novice can learn nothing from long runs of a single play ...        TO HIS DAUGHTER    NEW YORK, January 5, 1888,    ...  As for God's reward for what I have done, I can hardly appreciate  it; it is more like punishment for misdeeds (of which I've done many)  than grace for good ones (if I've done any).  Homelessness is the  actor's fate; physical incapacity to attain what is most required and  desired by such a spirit as I am a slave to.  If there be rewards, I  am certainly well paid, but hard schooling in life's thankless lessons  has made we somewhat of a philosopher, and I've learned to take the  buffets and rewards of fortune with equal thanks, and in suffering all  to suffer--I won't say nothing, but comparatively little.  Dick  Stoddard wrote a poem called \"The King's Bell,\" which fits my case  exactly (you may have read it) .  He dedicated it to Lorimer Graham,  who never knew an unhappy day in his brief life, instead of to me, who  never knew a really happy one.  You mustn't suppose from this that I'm  ill in mind or body: on the contrary, I am well enough in both; nor am  I a pessimist.  I merely wanted you to know that the sugar of my life  is bitter-sweet; perhaps not more so than every man's whose experience  has been above and below the surface....  Business has continued  large, and increases a little every night; the play will run two weeks  longer.  Sunday, at four o'clock, I start for Baltimore, arriving  there at ten o'clock....    To-morrow, a meeting of actors, managers, and artists at breakfast, to  discuss and organise, if possible, a theatrical club[1] like the  Garrick of London....        TO HIS DAUGHTER    DETROIT, April 04, 1890.    ...  Yes; it is indeed most gratifying to feel that age has not  rendered my work stale and tiresome, as is usually the case with  actors (especially tragedians) at my time.  Your dear mother's fear  was that I would culminate too early, as I seemed then to be advancing  so rapidly.  Somehow I can't rid myself of the belief that both she  and my father helped me.  But as for the compensation?  Nothing of  fame or fortune can compensate for the spiritual suffering that one  possessing such qualities has to endure.  To pass life in a sort of  dream, where \"nothing is but what is not\"--a loneliness in the very  midst of a constant crowd, as it were--is not a desirable condition of  existence, especially when the body also has to share the \"penalty of  greatness,\" as it is termed.  Bosh!  I'd sooner be an obscure farmer,  a hayseed from Wayback, or a cabinetmaker, as my father advised, than  the most distinguished man on earth.  But Nature cast me for the part  she found me best fitted for, and I have had to play it, and must play  it till the curtain falls.  But you must not think me sad about it.  No; I am used to it, and am contented.    I continue well, and act with a vigour which sometimes surprises  myself, and all the company notice it, and comment upon it.  I'm glad  the babes had a jolly birthday.  Bless 'em!  Love for all.    PAPA.        TO HIS DAUGHTER    THE PLAYERS, NEW YORK,  March 22, 1891.    DEAR DAUGHTER:    I'm in no mood for letter-writing to-day.  The shock (of Mr. Lawrence  Barrett's death) so sudden and so distressing, and the gloomy,  depressing weather, entirely unfit me for the least exertion--even to  think.  Hosts of friends, all eager to assist poor Mrs. Barrett, seem  helpless in confusion, and all the details of the sad business seem to  be huddled on her ...    General Sherman's son, \"Father Tom,\" as he is affectionately called by  all the family and the friends of the dear old General, will attend.  He was summoned from Europe recently to his father's deathbed, and he  happens to be in time to perform services for his father's friend,  poor Lawrence.  After the services to-morrow, the remains and a few  friends will go direct to Cohasset for the burial--Tuesday--where  Barrett had only two weeks ago placed his mother, removed from her New  York grave to a family lot which he had recently purchased at  Cohasset.  He had also enlarged his house there, where he intended to  pass his old age in privacy.  Doctor Smith was correct in his  assertion that the glandular disease was incurable, and the surgical  operation would prolong life only a year or so; the severe cold  produced pneumonia; which Barrett's physicians say might have been  overcome but for the glandular disease still in the blood.  Mrs.  Barrett knew from the first operation that he had at most a year or so  to live, and yet by the doctor's advice kept it secret, and did  everything to cheer and humour him.  She's a remarkable woman.  She  has been expecting to be suddenly called to him for more than a year  past, yet the blow came with terrible force.  Milly, Mr. Barrett's  youngest daughter, and her husband, came last night....  When I saw  Lawrence on Thursday he was in a burning fever and asked me to keep  away for fear his breath might affect me, and it pained him to talk.  He pulled through three acts of \"De Mauprat\" the night before, and  sent for his wife that night.  His death was very peaceful, with no  sign of pain.  A couple of weeks ago he and I were to meet General  Sherman at dinner: death came instead.  To-night Barrett had invited  about twenty distinguished men to meet me at Delmonico's, and again  the grim guest attends....    My room is like an office of some state official; letters, telegrams,  and callers come every moment, some on business, many in sympathy.  Three hours have elapsed since I finished the last sentence, and I  expect a call from Bromley before I retire.  A world of business  matters have been disturbed by this sudden break of contracts with  actors and managers, and everything pertaining to next season, as well  as much concerning the balance of the present one, must be rearranged  or cancelled.  I, of course, am free; but for the sake of the company  I shall fulfil my time, to pay their salaries, this week here; and  next week in Brooklyn, as they were engaged by Barrett for my  engagement.  After which they will be out of employment for the  balance of the season...    PAPA.        TO MISS EMMA F. CARY  SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY, 1864.    MY DEAR FRIEND:    A little lull in the whirl of excitement in which my brain has nearly  lost its balance affords me an opportunity to write to you.  It would  be difficult to explain the many little annoyances I have been  subjected to in the production of \"Richelieu,\" but when I tell you  that it far surpasses \"Hamlet,\" and exceeds all my expectations, you  may suppose that I have not been very idle all this while.  I wish you  could see it.    Professor Peirce[2] has been here, and he will tell you of it.  It  really seems that the dreams of my past life--so far as my profession  is concerned--are being realised.  What Mary and I used to plan for my  future, what Richard and I used laughingly to promise ourselves in  \"our model theatre,\" seems to be realised--in these two plays, at  least.  As history says of the great cardinal, I am \"too fortunate a  man not to be superstitious,\" and as I find my hopes being fulfilled,  I cannot help but believe that there is a sufficient importance in my  art to interest them still; that to a higher influence than the world  believes I am moved by I owe the success I have achieved.  Assured  that all I do in this advance carries, even beyond the range of my  little world (the theatre), an elevating and refining influence, while  in it the effect is good, I begin to feel really happy in my once  uneasy sphere of action.  I dare say I shall soon be contented with my  lot.  I will tell you this much: I have been offered the means to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17024"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#5)"],[1,"begins to flow gently south till arrested by the  flood of the great rains there, which takes place in February and March.  There is, it seems, a reflux for about three months in each year, flow  and reflow being the effect of the rains and evaporation on a lacustrine  river of some three hundred miles in length lying south of the equator.  The flow northwards I have myself observed, that again southwards rests  on native testimony, and it was elicited from the Arabs by pointing out  the northern current: they attributed the southern current to the effect  of the wind, which they say then blows south. Being cooled by the rains,  it comes south into the hot valley of this great Riverein Lake, or  lacustrine river.    In going to Moenekuss, the paramount chief of the Manyuema, forty days  are required. The headmen of trading parties remain with this chief (who  is said by all to be a very good man), and send their people out in all  directions to trade. Moenemogaia says that in going due north from  Moenekuss they come to a large river, the Robumba, which flows into and  is the Luama, and that this again joins the Lualaba, which retains its  name after flowing with the Lufira and Lofu into the still unvisited  Lake S.S.W. of this: it goes thence due north, probably into Mr. Baker's  part of the eastern branch of the Nile. When I have gone as far north  along Lualaba as I can this year, I shall be able to judge as to the  course I ought to take after receiving my goods and men from Zanzibar,  and may the Highest direct me, so that I may finish creditably the work  I have undertaken. I propose to start for Manyuema on the 3rd July.    The dagala or nsipe, a small fish caught in great numbers in every  flowing water, and very like whitebait, is said to emit its eggs by the  mouth, and these immediately burst and the young fish manages for  itself. The dagala never becomes larger than two or three inches in  length. Some, putrefied, are bitter, as if the bile were in them in a  good quantity. I have eaten them in Lunda of a pungent bitter taste,  probably arising from the food on which the fish feeds. Men say that  they have seen the eggs kept in the sides of the mouth till ready to go  off as independent fishes. The nghede-dege, a species of perch, and  another, the ndusi, are said to do the same. The Arabs imagine that fish  in general fall from the skies, but they except the shark, because they  can see the young when it is cut open.    _10th July, 1869._--After a great deal of delay and trouble about a  canoe, we got one from Habee for ten dotis or forty yards of calico, and  a doti or four yards to each of nine paddlers to bring the vessel back.  Thani and Zahor blamed me for not taking their canoes for nothing; but  they took good care not to give them, but made vague offers, which  meant, \"We want much higher pay for our dhows than Arabs generally  get:\" they showed such an intention to fleece me that I was glad to get  out of their power, and save the few goods I had. I went a few miles,  when two strangers I had allowed to embark (from being under obligations  to their masters), worked against each other: so I had to let one land,  and but for his master would have dismissed the other: I had to send an  apology to the landed man's master for politeness' sake.    [It is necessary to say a few words here, so unostentatiously does  Livingstone introduce this new series of explorations to the reader. The  Manyuema country, for which he set out on the 12th of July, 1869, was  hitherto unknown. As we follow him we shall see that in almost every  respect both the face of the country and the people differ from other  regions lying nearer to the East Coast. It appears that the Arabs had an  inkling of the vast quantities of ivory which might be procured there,  and Livingstone went into the new field with the foremost of those  hordes of Ujijian traders who, in all probability, will eventually  destroy tribe after tribe by slave-trading and pillage, as they have  done in so many other regions.]    Off at 6 A.M., and passed the mouth of the Luishe, in Kibwe Bay; 3-1/2  hours took us to Rombola or Lombola, where all the building wood of  Ujiji is cut.    _12th July, 1869._--Left at 1.30 A.M., and pulled 7-1/2 hours to the  left bank of the Malagarasi River. We cannot go by day, because about 11  A.M. a south-west wind commences to blow, which the heavy canoes cannot  face; it often begins earlier or later, according to the phases of the  moon. An east wind blows from sunrise till 10 or 11 A.M., and the  south-west begins. The Malagarasi is of considerable size at its  confluence, and has a large islet covered with eschinomena, or pith hat  material, growing in its way.    Were it not for the current Tanganyika would be covered with green scum  now rolling away in miles of length and breadth to the north; it would  also be salt like its shut-in bays. The water has now fallen two feet  perpendicularly. It took us twelve hours to ascend to the Malagarasi  River from Ujiji, and only seven to go down that distance. Prodigious  quantities of confervae pass us day and night in slow majestic flow. It  is called Shuare. But for the current Tanganyika would be covered with  \"Tikatika\" too, like Victoria Nyanza.    _13th July, 1869._--Off at 3.15 A.M., and in five hours reached Kabogo  Eiver; from this point the crossing is always accomplished: it is about  thirty miles broad. Tried to get off at 6 P.M., but after two miles the  south wind blew, and as it is a dangerous wind and the usual one in  storms, the men insisted on coming back, for the wind, having free  scope along the entire southern length of Tanganyika, raises waves  perilous to their heavy craft; after this the clouds cleared all away,  and the wind died off too; the full moon shone brightly, and this is  usually accompanied by calm weather here. Storms occur at new moon most  frequently.    _14th July, 1869._--Sounded in dark water opposite the high fountain  Kabogo, 326 fathoms, but my line broke in coming up, and we did not see  the armed end of the sounding lead with sand or mud on it: this is 1965  feet.    People awaking in fright utter most unearthly yells, and they are joined  in them by all who sleep near. The first imagines himself seized by a  wild beast, the rest roar because they hear him doing it: this indicates  the extreme of helpless terror.    _15th July, 1869._--After pulling all night we arrived at some islands  and cooked breakfast, then we went on to Kasenge islet on their south,  and came up to Mohamad Bogharib, who had come from Tongwe, and intended  to go to Manyuema. We cross over to the mainland, that is, to the  western shore of the Lake, about 300 yards off, to begin our journey on  the 21st. Lunars on 20th. Delay to prepare food for journey. Lunars  again 22nd.    A strong wind from the East to-day. A current sweeps round this islet  Kisenge from N.E. to S.E., and carries trees and duckweed at more than  a mile an hour in spite of the breeze blowing across it to the West. The  wind blowing along the Lake either way raises up water, and in a calm it  returns, off the shore. Sometimes it causes the current to go  southwards. Tanganyika narrows at Uvira or Vira, and goes out of sight  among the mountains there; then it appears as a waterfall into the Lake  of Quando seen by Banyamwezi.    _23rd July, 1869._--I gave a cloth to be kept for Kasanga, the chief of  Kasenge, who has gone to fight with the people of Goma.    _1st August, 1869._--Mohamad killed a kid as a sort of sacrifice, and  they pray to Hadrajee before eating it. The cookery is of their very  best, and I always get a share; I tell them that I like the cookery, but  not the prayers, and it is taken in good part.    _2nd August, 1869._--We embarked from the islet and got over to the  mainland, and slept in a hooked-thorn copse, with a species of black  pepper plant, which we found near the top of Mount Zomba, in the  Manganja country,[6] in our vicinity; it shows humidity of climate.    _3rd August, 1869._--Marched 3-1/4 hours south, along Tanganyika, in a  very undulating country; very fatiguing in my weakness. Passed many  screw-palms, and slept at Lobamba village.    _4th August, 1869._--A relative of Kasanga engaged to act as our guide,  so we remained waiting for him, and employed a Banyamwezi smith to make  copper balls with some bars of that metal presented by Syde bin Habib. A  lamb wasstolen, and all declared that the deed must have been done by  Banyamwezi. \"At Guha people never steal,\" and I believe this is true.    _7th August, 1869._--The guide having arrived, we marched 2-1/4 hours  west and crossed the River Logumba, about forty yards broad and knee  deep, with a rapid current between deep cut banks; it rises in the  western Kabogo range, and flows about S.W. into Tanganyika. Much dura or  _Holcus sorghum_ is cultivated on the rich alluvial soil on its banks by  the Guha people.    _8th August, 1869._--West through open forest; very undulating, and the  path full of angular fragments of quartz. We see mountains in the  distance.    _9th-10th August, 1869._--Westwards to Makhato's village, and met a  company of natives beating a drum as they came near; this is the peace  signal; if war is meant the attack is quiet and stealthy. There are  plenty of Masuko trees laden with fruit, but unripe. It is cold at  night, but dry, and the people sleep with only a fence at their heads,  but I have a shed built at every camp as a protection for the loads, and  sleep in it.    Any ascent, though gentle, makes me blow since the attack of pneumonia;  if it is inclined to an angle of 45 deg., 100 or 150 yards make me stop to  pant in distress.    _11th August, 1869._--Came to a village of Ba Rua, surrounded by hills  of some 200 feet above the plain; trees sparse.    _12th-13th August, 1869._--At villages of Mekheto. Guha people. Remain  to buy and prepare food, and"]]]
