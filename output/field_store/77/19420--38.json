The fire now filled the entire waist of the vessel, and the  noise of it was as the rumble and roar of a volcano. As for the light,  I declare that it put many a star clean out, and dimmed the radiance  of all the rest, as it flooded the sea for miles around, and a sea of  molten glass reflected it. My gorge rose at the long, low billows-sleek  as black satin--lifting and dipping in this ghastly glare. I preferred  to keep my eyes upon the little ship burning like a tar barrel as the  picture grew. But presently I thanked God aloud: there was the gig  swimming like a beetle over the bloodshot rollers in our wake.    In our unspeakable gladness at being quit of the ship, some minutes  passed before we discovered that the long-boat was slowly filling. The  water was at our ankles before a man of us cried out, so fast were our  eyes to the poor lost Lady Jermyn. Then all at once the ghastly fact  dawned upon us; and I think it was the mate himself who burst out crying  like a child. I never ascertained, however, for I had kicked off my  shoes and was busy baling with them. Others were hunting for the leak.  But the mischief was as subtle as it was mortal--as though a plank  had started from end to end. Within and without the waters rose  equally--then lay an instant level with our gunwales--then swamped us,  oh! so slowly, that I thought we were never going to sink. It was  like getting inch by inch into your tub; I can feel it now, creeping,  crawling up my back. \"It's coming! O Christ!\" muttered one as it came;  to me it was a downright relief to be carried under at last.    But then, thank God, I have always been a strong swimmer. The water was  warm and buoyant, and I came up like a cork, as I knew I should. I shook  the drops from my face, and there were the sweet stars once more; for  many an eye they had gone Out for ever; and there the burning wreck.    A man floundered near me, in a splutter of phosphorescence. I tried to  help him, and in an instant he had me wildly round the neck. In the end  I shook him off, poor devil, to his death. And he was the last I tried  to aid: have I not said already what I was become?    In a little an oar floated my way: I threw my arms across it and gripped  it with my chin as I swam. It relieved me greatly. Up and down I rode  among the oily black hillocks; I was down when there was a sudden flare  as though the sun had risen, and I saw still a few heads bobbing and a  few arms waving frantically around me. At the same instant a terrific  detonation split the ears; and when I rose on the next bald billow,  where the ship lay burning a few seconds before, there remained but a  red-hot spine that hissed and dwindled for another minute, and then left  a blackness through which every star shone with redoubled brilliance.    And now right and left splashed falling missiles; a new source of danger  or of temporary respite; to me, by a merciful Providence, it proved the  latter.    Some heavy thing fell with a mighty splash right in front of me. A few  more yards, and my brains had floated with the spume. As it was, the  oar was dashed from under my armpits; in another moment they had found a  more solid resting-place.    It was a hen-coop, and it floated bars upwards like a boat. In this  calm it might float for days. I climbed upon the bars-and the whole cage  rolled over on top of me.    Coming to the surface, I found to my joy that the hen-coop had righted  itself; so now I climbed up again, but this time very slowly and  gingerly; the balance was undisturbed, and I stretched myself cautiously  along the bars on my stomach. A good idea immediately occurred to me. I  had jumped as a matter of course into the flannels which one naturally  wears in the tropics. To their lightness I already owed my life, but the  common cricket-belt which was part of the costume was the thing to which  I owe it most of all. Loosening this belt a little, as I tucked my toes  tenaciously under the endmost bar, I undid and passed the two ends under  one of the middle bars, fastening the clasp upon the other side. If I  capsized now, well, we might go to the bottom together; otherwise the  hen-coop and I should not part company in a hurry; and I thought, I  felt, that she would float.    Worn out as I was, and comparatively secure for the moment, I will not  say that I slept; but my eyes closed, and every fibre rested, as I rose  and slid with the smooth, long swell. Whether I did indeed hear voices,  curses, cries, I cannot say positively to this day. I only know that I  raised my head and looked sharply all ways but the way I durst not look  for fear of an upset. And, again, I thought I saw first a tiny flame,  and then a tinier glow; and as my head drooped, and my eyes closed  again, I say I thought I smelt tobacco; but this, of course, was my  imagination supplying all the links from one.              CHAPTER IV. THE SILENT SEA      Remember (if indeed there be any need to remind you) that it is a  flagrant landsman who is telling you this tale. Nothing know I of  seamanship, save what one could not avoid picking up on the round voyage  of the Lady Jermyn, never to be completed on this globe. I may be told  that I have burned that devoted vessel as nothing ever burned on land or  sea. I answer that I write of what I saw, and that is not altered by a  miscalled spar or a misunderstood manouvre. But now I am aboard a craft  I handle for myself, and must make shift to handle a second time with  this frail pen.    The hen-coop was some six feet long, by eighteen or twenty inches in  breadth and depth. It was simply a long box with bars in lieu of a lid;  but it was very strongly built.    I recognized it as one of two which had stood lashed against either rail  of the Lady Jermyn's poop; there the bars had risen at right angles to  the deck; now they lay horizontal, a gridiron six feet long-and my bed.  And as each particular bar left its own stripe across my wearied body,  and yet its own comfort in my quivering heart, another day broke over  the face of the waters, and over me.    Discipline, what there was of it originally, had been the very first  thing to perish aboard our ill-starred ship; the officers, I am afraid,  were not much better than poor Ready made them out (thanks to Bendigo  and Ballarat), and little had been done in true ship-shape style all  night. All hands had taken their spell at everything as the fancy seized  them; not a bell had been struck from first to last; and I can only  conjecture that the fire raged four or five hours, from the fact that  it was midnight by my watch when I left it on my cabin drawers, and that  the final extinction of the smouldering keel was so soon followed by the  first deep hint of dawn. The rest took place with the trite rapidity of  the equatorial latitudes. It had been my foolish way to pooh-pooh the  old saying that there is no twilight in the tropics. I saw more truth in  it as I lay lonely on this heaving waste.    The stars were out; the sea was silver; the sun was up.    And oh! the awful glory of that sunrise! It was terrific; it was  sickening; my senses swam. Sunlit billows smooth and sinister, without a  crest, without a sound; miles and miles of them as I rose; an oily grave  among them as I fell. Hill after hill of horror, valley after valley of  despair! The face of the waters in petty but eternal unrest; and now  the sun must shine to set it smiling, to show me its cruel ceaseless  mouthings, to reveal all but the ghastlier horrors underneath.    How deep was it? I fell to wondering! Not that it makes any difference  whether you drown in one fathom or in ten thousand, whether you fall  from a balloon or from the attic window. But the greater depth or  distance is the worse to contemplate; and I was as a man hanging by his  hands so high above the world, that his dangling feet cover countries,  continents; a man who must fall very soon, and wonders how long he will  be falling, falling; and how far his soul will bear his body company.    In time I became more accustomed to the sun upon this heaving void; less  frightened, as a child is frightened, by the mere picture. And I have  still the impression that, as hour followed hour since the falling of  the wind, the nauseous swell in part subsided. I seemed less often on  an eminence or in a pit; my glassy azure dales had gentler slopes, or a  distemper was melting from my eyes.    At least I know that I had now less work to keep my frail ship trim,  though this also may have come by use and practice. In the beginning one  or other of my legs had been for ever trailing in the sea, to keep the  hen-coop from rolling over the other way; in fact, as I understand they  steer the toboggan in Canada, so I my little bark. Now the necessity for  this was gradually decreasing; whatever the cause, it was the greatest  mercy the day had brought me yet. With less strain on the attention,  however, there was more upon the mind. No longer forced to exert some  muscle twice or thrice a minute, I had time to feel very faint, and yet  time to think. My soul flew homing to its proper prison. I was no longer  any unit at unequal strife with the elements; instincts common to my  kind were no longer my only stimulus. I was my poor self again; it was  my own little life, and no other, that I wanted to go on living; and  yet I felt vaguely there was some special thing I wished to live for,  something that had not been very long in my ken; something that had  perhaps nerved and strengthened me all these hours. What, then, could it  be? I could not think.    For moments or for minutes I wondered stupidly, dazed as I was. Then  I remembered--and the tears gushed to my eyes. How could I ever have  forgotten? I deserved it all, all, all! To think that many a time we  must have sat together on this very coop! I kissed its blistering edge  at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#5)"],[1,"noise at the  bottom of the door. At first she thought it was a mouse. Then she  thought it must be something knocking.    So she upped and opened the door and what did she see? Why! a small,  little, black Thing with a long tail that whisked round and round ever  so fast.    \"What are you crying for?\" said that Thing, making a bow, and twirling  its tail so fast that she could scarcely see it.    \"What's that to you?\" said she, shrinking a bit, for that Thing was very  queer like.    \"Don't look at my tail if you're frightened,\" says That, smirking. \"Look  at my toes. Ain't they beautiful?\"    And sure enough That had on buckled shoes with high heels and big bows,  ever so smart.    [Illustration: A small, little, black Thing with a long tail]    So she kind of forgot about the tail, and wasn't so frightened, and  when That asked her again why she was crying, she upped and said, \"It  won't do no good if I do.\"    \"You don't know that,\" says That, twirling its tail faster and faster,  and sticking out its toes. \"Come, tell me, there's a good girl.\"    \"Well,\" says she, \"it can't do any harm if it doesn't do good.\" So she  dried her pretty eyes and told That all about the pies, and the skeins,  and everything from first to last.    And then that little, black Thing nearly burst with laughing. \"If that  is all, it's easy mended!\" it says. \"I'll come to your window every  morning, take the flax, and bring it back spun into five skeins at  night. Come! shall it be a bargain?\"    Now she, for all she was so gatless and thoughtless, said, cautious  like:    \"But what is your pay?\"    Then That twirled its tail so fast you couldn't see it, and stuck out  its beautiful toes, and smirked and looked out of the corners of its  eyes. \"I will give you three guesses every night to guess my name, and  if you haven't guessed it before the month is up, why\"--and That twirled  its tail faster and stuck out its toes further, and smirked and  sniggered more than ever--\"you shall be mine, my beauty.\"    Three guesses every night for a whole month! She felt sure she would be  able for so much; and there was no other way out of the business, so she  just said, \"Yes! I agree!\"    And lor! how That twirled its tail, and bowed, and smirked, and stuck  out its beautiful toes.    Well, the very next day her husband led her to the strange room again,  and there was the day's food, and a spinning-wheel and a great bundle of  flax.    \"There you are, my dear,\" says he as polite as polite. \"And remember! if  there are not five whole skeins to-night, I fear your head will come  off!\"    At that she began to tremble, and after he had gone away and locked the  door, she was just thinking of a good cry, when she heard a queer  knocking at the window. She upped at once and opened it, and sure enough  there was the small, little, black Thing sitting on the window-ledge,  dangling its beautiful toes and twirling its tail so that you could  scarcely see it.    \"Good-morning, my beauty,\" says That. \"Come! hand over the flax, sharp,  there's a good girl.\"    So she gave That the flax and shut the window and, you may be sure, ate  her victuals, for, as you know, she had a good appetite, and the King,  her husband, had promised to give her everything she liked to eat. So  she ate to her heart's content, and when evening came and she heard that  queer knocking at the window again, she upped and opened it, and there  was the small, little, black Thing with five spun skeins on his arm!    And it twirled its tail faster than ever, and stuck out its beautiful  toes, and bowed and smirked and gave her the five skeins.    Then That said, \"And now, my beauty, what is That's name?\"    And she answered quite easy like:    \"That is Bill.\"    \"No, it ain't,\" says That, and twirled its tail.    \"Then That is Ned,\" says she.    \"No, it ain't,\" says That, and twirled its tail faster.    \"Well,\" says she a bit more thoughtful, \"That is Mark.\"    \"No, it ain't,\" says That, and laughs and laughs and laughs, and twirls  its tail so as you couldn't see it, as away it flew.    Well, when the King, her husband, came in, he was fine and pleased to  see the five skeins all ready for him, for he was fond of his pretty  wife.    \"I shall not have to order your head off, my dear,\" says he. \"And I hope  all the other days will pass as happily.\" Then he said good-night and  locked the door and left her.    But next morning they brought her fresh flax and even more delicious  foods. And the small, little, black Thing came knocking at the window  and stuck out its beautiful toes and twirled its tail faster and faster,  and took away the bundle of flax and brought it back all spun into five  skeins by evening.    Then That made her guess three times what That's name was; but she could  not guess right, and That laughed and laughed and laughed as it flew  away.    Now every morning and evening the same thing happened, and every evening  she had her three guesses; but she never guessed right. And every day  the small, little, black Thing laughed louder and louder and smirked  more and more, and looked at her quite maliceful out of the corners of  its eyes until she began to get frightened, and instead of eating all  the fine foods left for her, spent the day in trying to think of names  to say. But she never hit upon the right one.    So it came to the last day of the month but one, and when the small,  little, black Thing arrived in the evening with the five skeins of flax  all ready spun, it could hardly say for smirking:    \"Ain't you got That's name yet?\"    So says she--for she had been reading her Bible:    \"Is That Nicodemus?\"    \"No, it ain't,\" says That, and twirled its tail faster than you could  see.    \"Is That Samuel?\" says she all of a flutter.    \"No, it ain't, my beauty,\" chuckles That, looking maliceful.    \"Well--is That Methuselah?\" says she, inclined to cry.    Then That just fixes her with eyes like a coal a-fire, and says, \"No, it  ain't that neither, so there is only to-morrow night and then you'll be  mine, my beauty.\"    And away the small, little, black Thing flew, its tail twirling and  whisking so fast that you couldn't see it.    Well, she felt so bad she couldn't even cry; but she heard the King, her  husband, coming to the door, so she made bold to be cheerful, and tried  to smile when he said, \"Well done, wife! Five skeins again! I shall not  have to order your head off after all, my dear, of that I'm quite sure,  so let us enjoy ourselves.\" Then he bade the servants bring supper, and  a stool for him to sit beside his Queen, and down they sat, lover-like,  side by side.    But the poor Queen could eat nothing; she could not forget the small,  little, black Thing. And the King hadn't eaten but a mouthful or two  when he began to laugh, and he laughed so long and so loud that at last  the poor Queen, all lackadaisical as she was, said:    \"Why do you laugh so?\"    \"At something I saw to-day, my love,\" says the King. \"I was out  a-hunting, and by chance I came to a place I'd never been in before. It  was in a wood, and there was an old chalk-pit there, and out of the  chalk-pit there came a queer kind of a sort of a humming, humming noise.  So I got off my hobby to see what made it, and went quite quiet to the  edge of the pit and looked down. And what do you think I saw? The  funniest, queerest, smallest, little, black Thing you ever set eyes  upon. And it had a little spinning-wheel and it was spinning away for  dear life, but the wheel didn't go so fast as its tail, and that span  round and round--_ho-ho-ha-ha!_--you never saw the like. And its little  feet had buckled shoes and bows on them, and they went up and down in a  desperate hurry. And all the time that small, little, black Thing kept  bumming and booming away at these words:      \"Name me, name me not,     Who'll guess it's Tom-Tit-Tot.\"    Well, when she heard these words the Queen nearly jumped out of her  skin for joy; but she managed to say nothing, but ate her supper quite  comfortably.    And she said no word when next morning the small, little, black Thing  came for the flax, though it looked so gleeful and maliceful that she  could hardly help laughing, knowing she had got the better of it. And  when night came and she heard that knocking against the window-panes,  she put on a wry face, and opened the window slowly as if she was  afraid. But that Thing was as bold as brass and came right inside,  grinning from ear to ear. And oh, my goodness! how That's tail was  twirling and whisking!    \"Well, my beauty,\" says That, giving her the five skeins all ready spun,  \"what's my name?\"    Then she put down her lip, and says, tearful like,  \"Is--is--That--Solomon?\"    \"No, it ain't,\" laughs That, smirking out of the corner of That's eye.  And the small, little, black Thing came further into the room.    So she tried again--and this time she seemed hardly able to speak for  fright.    \"Well--is That--Zebedee?\" she says.    \"No, it ain't,\" cried the impet, full of glee. And it came quite close  and stretched out its little black hands to her, and O-oh, ITS  TAIL...!!!    \"Take time, my beauty,\" says That, sort of jeering like, and its small,  little, black eyes seemed to eat her up. \"Take time! Remember! next  guess and you're mine!\" Well, she backed just a wee bit from it, for it  was just horrible to look at; but then she laughed out and pointed her  finger at it and said, says she:              \"Name me, name me not,            _Your_ name is                 _Tom_                  TIT                 _TOT_.\"    And you never heard such a shriek as that small, little, black Thing  gave out. Its tail dropped down straight, its feet all crumpled up, and  away That flew into the dark, and she never saw it no more.    And she lived happy ever after with her husband, the King.
