Yet that might and that greatness were reduced to a mere show  before his long reign terminated; and the Moghul Empire resembled   to use a familiar image  one of those Etruscan corpses which,  though crowned and armed, are destined to crumble at the breath  of heaven or at the touch of human hands. And still more did it  resemble some splendid palace, whose gilded cupolas and towering  minarets are built of materials collected from every quarter of  the world, only to collapse in undistinguishable ruin when the  Ficus religiosa has lodged its destructive roots in the  foundation on which they rest. Thus does this great ruler furnish  another instance of the familiar but everneeded lesson, that  countries may be over-governed. Had he been less anxious to stamp  his own image and superscription upon the palaces of princes and  the temples of priests; upon the moneys of every market, and upon  every human heart and conscience; he might have governed with as  much success as his free thinking and pleasure-seeking  predecessors. But he was the Louis Quatorze of the East; with  less of pomp than his European contemporary, but not less of the  lust of conquest, of centralization, and of religious conformity.  Though each monarch identified the State with himself, yet it may  be doubted if either, on his deathbed, knew that his monarchy was  dying also. But so it was that to each succeeded that gradual but  complete cataclysm which seems the inevitable consequence of the  system which each pursued.    One point peculiar to the Indian emperor is that the persecuting  spirit of his reign was entirely due to his own character. The  jovial and clement Chaghtai Turks, from whom he was descended,  were never bigoted Mohamadans. Indeed it may be fairly doubted  whether Akbar and his son Jahangir were, to any considerable  extent, believers in the system of the Arabian prophet. Far  different, however, was the creed of Aurangzeb, and ruthlessly  did he seek to force it upon his Hindu subjects. Thus there were  now added to the usual dangers of a large empire the two peculiar  perils of a jealous centralization of power, and a deep-seated  disaffection of the vast majority of the subjects. Nor was this  all. There had never been any fixed settlement of the succession;  and not even the sagacity of this politic emperor was superior to  the temptation of arbitrarily transferring the dignity of  heir-apparent from one son to another during his long reign.  True, this was no vice confined exclusively to Aurangzeb. His  predecessors had done the like; but then their systems had been  otherwise genial and fortunate. His successors, too, were  destined to pursue the same infatuated course; and it was a  defeated intrigue of this sort which probably first brought the  puppet emperor of our own time into that fatal contact with the  power of England which sent him to die in a remote and  dishonoured exile.    When, therefore, the sceptre had fallen from the dead man's  hands, there were numerous evil influences ready to attend its  assumption by any hands that were less experienced and strong.  The prize was no less than the possession of the whole peninsula,  estimated to have yielded a yearly revenue of the nominal value  of thirty-four millions of pounds sterling, and guarded by a  veteran army of five hundred thousand men.    The will of the late emperor had left the disposal of his  inheritance entirely unsettled. \"Whoever of my fortunate sons  shall chance to rule my empire,\" is the only reference to the  subject that occurs in this brief and extraordinary document.    His eldest surviving son consequently found two competitors in  the field, in the persons of his brothers. These, however, he  defeated in succession, and assumed the monarchy under the title  of BAHADUR SHAH. A wise and valiant prince, he did not reign long  enough to show how far he could have succeeded in controlling or  retarding the evils above referred to; but his brief occupation  of the monarchy is marked by the appearance of all those powers  and dynasties which afterwards participated, all in its  dismemberment, and most in its spoil. Various enemies, both Hindu  and Musalman, appeared, and the Empire of the Chaghtai Turks was  sapped and battered by attempts which, though mostly founded on  the most selfish motives, involved a more or less patriotic  feeling. Sikhs, Mahrattas, and Rajputs, all aimed at  independence; while the indigenous Mohamadans, instead of joining  the Turks in showing a common front to the common enemy, weakened  the defence irrecoverably by opposition and rivalry.    In the attempt to put down the Sikhs, Bahadur died at Lahor, just  five years after the death of his father. The usual struggle  ensued. Three of the princes were defeated and slain in detail;  and the partisans of the eldest son, Mirza Moizudin, conferred  upon him the succession (by the title of JAHANDAR SHAH), after a  wholesale slaughter of such of his kindred as fell within their  grasp. After a few months, the aid of the governors of Bihar and  Allahabad, Saiyids of the tribe of Barha, enabled the last  remaining claimant to overthrow and murder the incapable Emperor.  The conqueror succeeded his uncle under the title of FAROKHSIAR.    The next step of the Saiyids, men of remarkable courage and  ability was to attack the Rajputs; and to extort from their  chief, the Maharajah Ajit Sing, the usual tribute, and the hand  of his daughter for the Emperor, who, like some of his  predecessors, was anxious to marry a Hindu princess. But the  levity and irresolution of the Emperor soon led to his being, in  his turn, dethroned and slaughtered. The race was now quite worn  out.    A brief interregnum ensued, during which the all-powerful Saiyids  sought to administer the powers of sovereignty behind the screen  of any royal scion they could find of the requisite nonentity.  But there was a Nothing still more absolute than any they could  find; and after two of these shadow-kings had passed in about  seven months, one after the other, into the grave, the usurpers  were at length constrained to make a choice of a more efficient  puppet. This was the son of Bahadur Shah's youngest son, who had  perished in the wars which followed that emperor's demise. His  private name was Sultan Roshan Akhtar (\"Prince Fair Star\"), but  he assumed with the Imperial dignity the title of MOHAMMAD SHAH,  and is memorable as the last Indian emperor that ever sat upon  the peacock throne of Shah Jahan.    The events mentioned in the preceding brief summary, though they  do not comprehend the whole disintegration of the Empire, are  plainly indicative of what is to follow. In the final chapters of  the First Part we shall behold somewhat more in detail the  rapidly accelerating event. During the long reign of Mohammad  foreign violence will be seen accomplishing what native vice and  native weakness have commenced; and the successors to his  dismantled throne will be seen passing like other decorations in  a passive manner from one mayor of the palace to another, or  making fitful efforts to be free, which only rivet their chains  and hasten their destruction. One by one the provinces fall away  from this distempered centre. At length we shall find the throne  literally without an occupant, and the curtain will seem to  descend while preparations are being made for the last act of  this Imperial tragedy.    CHAPTER III.    A.D. 1719-48        Muhammad Shah  Chin Kulich Khan, his retirement from Dehli   Movements of the Mahrattas  Invasion of Nadir Shah  Ahmad Khan  repulsed by the Moghuls.        GUIDED by his mother, a person of sense and spirit, the young  Emperor began his reign by forming a party of Moghul friends, who  were hostile to the Saiyids on every conceivable account. The  former were Sunnis, the latter Shias; and perhaps the animosities  of sects are stronger than those of entirely different creeds.  Moreover, the courtiers were proud of a foreign descent; and,  while they despised the ministers as natives of India, they  possessed in their mother tongue  Turkish  a means of  communicating with the Emperor (a man of their own race) from  which the ministers were excluded. The Saiyids were soon  overthrown, their ruin being equally desired by Chin Kulich, the  head of the Turkish party, and Saadat Ali, the newly-arrived  adventurer from Persia. These noblemen now formed the rival  parties of Turan and Iran; and became distinguished, the one as  founder of the principality of Audh, abolished in 1856, the other  as that of the dynasty of Haidarabad, which still subsists. Both,  however, were for the time checked by the ambition and energy of  the Mahrattas. Chin Kulich was especially brought to his knees in  Bhopal, where the Mahrattas wrung from him the cession of Malwa,  and a promise of tribute to be paid by the Imperial Government to  these rebellious brigands.    This was a galling situation for an ancient nobleman, trained in  the traditions of the mighty Aurangzeb. The old man was now  between two fires. If he went on to his own capital, Haidarabad,  he would be exposed to wear out the remainder of his days in the  same beating of the air that had exhausted his master. If he  returned to the capital of the Empire, he saw an interminable  prospect of contempt and defeat at the hands of the  Captain-General Khan Dauran, the chief of the courtiers who had  been wont to break their jests upon the old-fashioned manners of  the veteran.    Thus straitened, the Nizam, for by that title Chin Kulich was now  beginning to be known, took counsel with Saadat, the Persian, who  was still at Dehli. Nadir Shah, the then ruler of Persia, had  been for some time urging on the Court of Dehli remonstrances  arising out of boundary quarrels and similar grievances.

In any  case that may arise, as, for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism,  one of two positions is necessarily true--that is, the thing is right  within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all  good citizens, or it is wrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by  legal enactments; and in neither case is the interposition of mob law  either necessary, justifiable, or excusable....    They (histories of the Revolution) were pillars of the temple of  liberty; and now that they have crumbled away, that temple must fall  unless we, their descendants, supply their places with other pillars,  hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason. Passion has helped us, but  can do so no more. It will in future be our enemy. Reason--cold,  calculating, unimpassioned reason--must furnish all the materials for  our future support and defence. Let those materials be moulded into  general intelligence, sound morality, and, in particular, a reverence  for the Constitution and laws; and that we improved to the last, that we  remained free to the last, that we revered his name to the last, that  during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or  desecrate his resting-place, shall be that which to learn the last trump  shall awaken our Washington.    Upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest, as the rock of its  basis; and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution,  \"the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\"    Many great and good men, sufficiently qualified for any task they should  undertake, may ever be found, whose ambition would aspire to nothing  beyond a seat in Congress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair. But  such belong not to the family of the lion or the brood of the eagle.  What? Think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a  Napoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks  regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to  story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others. It  denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to  tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It  thirsts and burns for distinction; and, if possible, it will have it,  whether at the expense of emancipating slaves, or enslaving free men. Is  it unreasonable, then, to expect that some men, possessed of the  loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its  utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us? And when such a  one does, it will require the people to be united with each other,  attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent, to  successfully frustrate his design.    Distinction will be his paramount object, and although he would as  willingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet that  opportunity being passed, and nothing left to be done in the way of  building up, he would sit down boldly to the task of pulling down. Here,  then, is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such a one as could not  well have existed heretofore.           *       *       *       *       *    All honour to our Revolutionary ancestors, to whom we are indebted for  these institutions. They will not be forgotten. In history we hope they  will be read of, and recounted, so long as the Bible shall be read. But  even granting that they will, their influence cannot be what it  heretofore has been. Even then, they cannot be so universally known, nor  so vividly felt, as they were by the generation just gone to rest. At  the close of that struggle, nearly every adult male had been a  participator in some of its scenes. The consequence was, that of those  scenes, in the form of a husband, a father, a son, or a brother, a  living history was to be found in every family,--a history bearing the  indubitable testimonies to its own authenticity in the limbs mangled, in  the scars of wounds received in the midst of the very scenes related; a  history, too, that could be read and understood alike by all, the wise  and the ignorant, the learned and the unlearned. But those histories are  gone. They can be read no more for ever. They were a fortress of  strength; but what the invading foemen could never do, the silent  artillery of time has done,--the levelling of its walls. They are gone.  They were a forest of giant oaks; but the resistless hurricane has swept  over them, and left only here and there a lonely trunk, despoiled of its  verdure, shorn of its foliage, unshading and unshaded, to murmur in a  few more gentle breezes, and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few  more ruder storms, and then to sink and be no more.          HUMOROUS ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH A LADY HE WAS REQUESTED TO  MARRY    _A Letter to Mrs. O.H. Browning. Springfield, Illinois. April 1, 1838_      Dear Madam, Without apologising for being egotistical, I shall make the  history of so much of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the subject  of this letter. And, by the way, I now discover that in order to give a  full and intelligible account of the things I have done and suffered  since I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened  before.    It was, then, in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my  acquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine, being about to pay a  visit to her father and other relatives residing in Kentucky, proposed  to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on  condition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all  convenient dispatch. I, of course, accepted the proposal, for you know I  could not have done otherwise had I really been averse to it; but  privately, between you and me, I was most confoundedly well pleased with  the project. I had seen the said sister some three years before, thought  her intelligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to plodding  life through hand-in-hand with her. Time passed on, the lady took her  journey, and in due time returned, sister in company, sure enough. This  astonished me a little, for it appeared to me that her coming so readily  showed that she was a trifle too willing, but on reflection it occurred  to me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to  come, without anything concerning me having been mentioned to her, and  so I concluded that if no other objection presented itself, I would  consent to waive this. All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival  in the neighbourhood--for, be it remembered, I had not yet seen her,  except about three years previous, as above mentioned. In a few days we  had an interview, and, although I had seen her before, she did not look  as my imagination had pictured her. I knew she was over-size, but she  now appeared a fair match for Falstaff. I knew she was called an \"old  maid,\" and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the  appellation, but now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid  thinking of my mother; and this, not from withered features,--for her  skin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into wrinkles--but  from her want of teeth, weather-beaten appearance in general, and from a  kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at  the size of infancy and reached her present bulk in less than  thirty-five or forty years; and, in short, I was not at all pleased with  her. But what could I do? I had told her sister that I would take her  for better or for worse, and I made a point of honour and conscience in  all things to stick to my word, especially if others had been induced to  act on it, which in this case I had no doubt they had, for I was now  fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have her, and hence  the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my bargain. \"Well,\"  thought I, \"I have said it, and, be the consequences what they may, it  shall not be my fault if I fail to do it.\" At once I determined to  consider her my wife, and this done, all my powers of discovery were put  to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set off  against her defects. I tried to imagine her handsome, which, but for her  unfortunate corpulency, was actually true. Exclusive of this, no woman  that I have ever seen has a finer face. I also tried to convince myself  that the mind was much more to be valued than the person, and in this  she was not inferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had been  acquainted.    Shortly after this, without attempting to come to any positive  understanding with her, I set out for Vandalia, when and where you first  saw me. During my stay there I had letters from her which did not change  my opinion of either her intellect or intention, but, on the contrary,  confirmed it in both.    All this while, although I was fixed \"firm as the surge-repelling rock\"  in my resolution, I found I was continually repenting the rashness which  had led me to make it. Through life I have been in no bondage, either  real or imaginary, from the thraldom of which I so much desired to be  free. After my return home I saw nothing to change my opinion of her in  any particular. She was the same, and so was I. I now spent my time in  planning how I might get along in life after my contemplated change of  circumstances should have taken place, and how I might procrastinate the  evil day for a time, which I really dreaded as much, perhaps more, than  an Irishman does the halter.    After all my sufferings upon this deeply interesting subject, here I  am, wholly, unexpectedly, completely out of the \"scrape,\" and I now want  to know if you can guess how I got out of it--out, clear, in every sense  of the term--no violation of word, honour, or conscience. I don't  believe you can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the  lawyer says, it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had  delayed the matter as long as I"]]]
