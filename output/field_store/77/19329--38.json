A good formula  for baking powder is, tartaric acid 8 ozs., sodium bicarbonate 9 ozs.,  rice flour 10 to 20 ozs. The last is added to baking powders to improve  the keeping quality and to add bulk. The ingredients must be first  carefully dried, the sodium bicarbonate at not too high a temperature or  it decomposes, and then thoroughly mixed; this must be preserved in well  closed and dry bottles. Another formula, which is slow rising and well  adapted for pastry, is sodium bicarbonate 4 ozs., cream of tartar 9 ozs.,  rice flour about 14 ozs. Custard powders consist of starch, colouring and  flavouring. Egg powders are similar to baking powders but contain yellow  colouring. Little objection can be taken to them if they are coloured with  saffron; turmeric would do if it were not that it gives a slightly  unpleasant taste. Artificial colouring matters or coal tar derivatives are  much used, several of these are distinctly poisonous.    Drinks.--It is better not to drink during eating, or insalivation may be  interfered with; a drink is better taken at the end of a meal. The  practice of washing down food with hot tea is bad. The refreshing nature  of a cup of hot tea, coffee, or cocoa is to a very great extent due to the  warmth of the water. The benefit is felt at once, before the alkaloid can  enter the blood stream and stimulate the nerve centres. Hot water, not too  hot to cause congestion of the mucous membrane, is one of the best drinks.  When the purity of the water supply is doubtful, there is advantage in  first bringing it to the boil, as pathogenic bacteria are destroyed. Some  find it beneficial to drink a cup of hot water the first thing in the  morning; this cleanses the stomach from any accumulation of mucus.    If fruit, succulent vegetables, or cooked food, containing much water be  freely used, and there be little perspiration, it is possible to do  without drinking; but there is danger of taking insufficient water to  hold freely in solution the waste products excreted by the body.    Aerated drinks, except a very few of the best, and non-alcoholic beers and  wines, are generally unwholesome, from their containing preservatives,  foaming powders, artificial flavourings, &c.    Stimulants.--Tea and coffee contain an alkaloid theine, besides volatile  oils, tannin, &c. Cocoa contains the milder alkaloid, theobromine. They  stimulate the heart and nervous systems; tea and coffee have also a  diuretic effect. Formerly they were erroneously thought to lessen tissue  waste. These alkaloids, being purins, are open to the general objections  named elsewhere. Stimulants do not impart energy or force of any kind, but  only call forth reserve strength by exciting the heart, nervous system,  &c., to increased activity. This is followed by a depression which is as  great, generally greater, than the previous stimulation. Except, perhaps,  as an occasional medicine, stimulants, should be avoided. Analysis of  cocoa shows a good proportion of proteids and a very large quantity of  fat. The claim that it is a valuable and nutritious food would only be  true if it could be eaten in such quantities as are other foods (bread,  fruits, &c.). Were this attempted, poisoning would result from the large  quantity of alkaloid. The food value of half a spoonful or thereabouts of  cocoa is insignificant. Certain much advertised cocoa mixtures are  ridiculous in their pretentions, unscientific in preparation, and often  injurious.    Cereals.--The most valuable is wheat, from its proteid being chiefly in  the form known as gluten. From its tenacity, gluten enables a much better  loaf to be produced from wheat than from any other cereal. The outer part  of the grain is the richest in mineral matter and proteid. Wheatmeal bread  shows a considerably higher proteid value than white. A large proportion  of the proteid in the outer coats of the wheat berry is, however, not  digested, and in some experiments the waste has been enough to quite  nullify its seeming advantage over white bread. Coarsely ground, sharp  branny particles in bread irritate the intestines, and cause excessive  waste of nutriment; but finely ground wheatmeal is free from this  objection, and is beneficial in preventing constipation. The comparative  value of white and brown bread has been much discussed; it depends both  on the quality of the bread and the condition of the digestive organs.  Experiments on the digestion of bread and other things, have often been  made on persons unaccustomed to such foods, or the foods have been given  in excessive quantity. To those accustomed to it good wheatmeal bread is  much pleasanter, more satisfying, and better flavoured than white; indeed,  the latter is described as insipid. Most bakers' bread is of  unsatisfactory quality. Flour and bread contain very little fat, the  absence of which is considered a defect. This is remedied by the addition  of butter, fat or oil, or by nuts, &c., which are rich in oil. These may  be mixed with the flour prior to cooking, or used afterwards.    Oats contain a substance called avenin, apparently an alkaloid, which has  an irritating action; the quantity is variable. It is to this that the  so-called heating effect of oatmeal on some persons is due.    Prepared Cereals or Breakfast Foods.--Analyses were made of 34 of these  cereal preparations by Weems and Ellis (Iowa State College Agricultural  Bulletin, 1904). They report that the foods possess no nutritive value in  excess of ordinary food materials; that the claim made for many  pre-digested foods are valueless, and no reliance can be placed on the  statement that they are remedies for any disease.    Oatmeal and other cereals are sold in packets as being partially cooked.  We do not doubt that they have been subjected to a dry heat, but this has  scarcely any effect on their starch and other constituents. The difference  is a mechanical one. In rolled oats the grains are so cracked and broken,  that on boiling with water, the water readily penetrates and more quickly  cooks them throughout. There are other prepared cereal foods, but we doubt  whether they are thoroughly cooked after the short boiling directed on the  labels. They are a great convenience where it is difficult to get the time  necessary for cooking the ordinary cereals. Coarsely ground wheat is too  irritating when made into porridge, but there are some granulated wheats  sold in packets, which are quite suitable. The Ralston breakfast food is  excellent. They are rich in the phosphates and salts, found in the outer  part of the grain. One cereal preparation called Grape Nuts, has had its  starch converted into maltose and dextrin (maltose being a sugar), by a  scientific application of the diastase of the grain. It is consequently  easier of digestion and requires no cooking. It is beneficial for some  forms of indigestion. There are several competing foods of less merit, the  starch being less perfectly changed; one at least of which is  objectionably salt. Properly cooked starch is readily digested by healthy  persons, and for them malted food is of no special value.    Pulse, or Legumes, includes haricots and other beans, peas and lentils.  The proteid contained is that variety known as legumin, which is either  the same, or is closely allied, to the casein of milk and cheese. Pulse is  very rich in proteid, the dried kinds in general use, contain 24 or 25 per  cent. The richest is the soy-bean, which is used in China and Japan, it  contains 35 per cent., besides 19 per cent. of fat. Pulse requires  thorough cooking, haricots taking the longest time. Split lentils are  cooked sooner, and are better digested; this is chiefly due to the removal  of the skins. The haricots, bought from small grocers who have a slow  sale, are often old, and will not cook tender. Pulse is best adapted to  the labouring classes; the sedentary should eat it sparingly, it is liable  to cause flatulence or accumulation of gas in the intestines, and  constipation. Haricots are easier to digest when mashed and mixed with  other food. Pulse was formerly stated to leave much undigested residue.  Recent experiments have shown that it is satisfactorily digested under  favourable conditions. Struempell found beans in their skins to leave a  large proportion of proteid matter unabsorbed. Lentil meal mixed with  other food was digested in a perfectly satisfactory manner. Another  experimenter (Rubner) found that when even the very large quantity of  1-1/8 pound of dried split peas per day were eaten, only 17 per cent. of  proteid matter was unabsorbed, which compares very well with the 11 per  cent. of proteid left from a macaroni diet, with which the same man was  fed at another time. Had a reasonable quantity of peas been eaten per day,  the quantity undigested would probably have differed little from that of  other foods.    Nuts are, as a rule, very rich in oil and contain a fair proportion of  proteid; when well masticated they are a very valuable food. Walnuts are  one of the best, and the kernels can be purchased shelled, thus avoiding  much trouble. They can be finely ground in a nut-mill and used for several  purposes, mixed in the proportion of about two ounces to the pound of  wheatmeal they produce a rich flavoured bread. They can also he used in  sweet cakes and in rich puddings to increase their food value, lightness  and taste. Pine kernels being very oily, can be used with flour in the  place of lard or butter.    Fruits are generally looked upon as luxuries, rather than as food  capable of supplying a meal or a substantial part of one. They are usually  eaten only when the appetite has been appeased by what is considered more  substantial fare. Fresh fruits contain a larger proportion of water than  nearly all other raw foods, and consequently the proportion of  nourishment is small; but we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#5)"],[1,"the tapes. There is  now only 15-1/2 feet on the bar, so it is necessary to lighten the  _Leopoldville_ still more before it will be possible to cross. Thus  early one of the chief difficulties in the Congo the transport of  goods--is demonstrated.    A fine crocodile lies asleep on the bank within easy range as we go back  to the ship in the launch, but no one has a rifle so his dreams are  undisturbed. As the _Leopoldville_ will not be able to reach Boma until  the morrow, we decide to go on in the _Heron_, a small ship which  calls for all the State passengers. After Fetish Rock, the river bends  sharply to the right and soon after Boma is in sight. At this distance  however, the town merely appears as groups of white houses amid trees  backed by green hills. Guarding the approach is a strong looking fort  which already has a history, for it was captured by rebels and held for  one or two days a few years ago.    As the sun was seeking his couch we arrive at the iron pier at Boma on  which we find Mr. Underwood, the Director of the well known English  trading house of Messrs. Hatton and Cookson. With him we walk down the  main business street of the town; a wide shady road lined with shops,  hotels, and restaurants and traversed by a steam tram. At the end of  this street the road continues to the right, up an incline and opposite  to the corner is one of the entrances to the Residency. Passing this we  leave a Catholic church, constructed of corrugated iron, on the right  and enter a shady avenue in which is the Secretariat. We are then  introduced to Mr. Vandamme, the Secretaire General, who at once takes us  to the Residency and presents us to Mr. Costermans, the Governor General  of the Congo Free State, who hopes we shall travel wherever we feel  inclined and see anything we desire.    The Residency is a large two storey house surrounded by a wide verandah  and is built of iron plates bolted together. It is raised about ten feet  from the ground on iron pillars and approached by a wide staircase with  wooden steps. It is surrounded by a well kept garden in which are some  statues and many tropical plants. The view from the verandah, looking up  and down the river is very pretty. Although the house is in good  condition and the dining room large enough to seat thirty people, it is  thought not to be worthy of its function, and another large building  will soon be erected on the same site.    After this visit we proceed to a house which is kept for the use of the  higher State Officials when they pass through Boma and which was now  placed at our disposal. It is constructed in a similar manner to the  Residency and although smaller, contains three lofty reception and two  bed rooms. Two _boys_. are told off to attend to our wants and after a  rest we take a stroll round the town with Mr. Vandamme. Most of the  official residencies are situated in one Avenue and are surrounded by  gardens in which palms, bulbous trees, and acacias give welcome shade to  the roses beneath. The Avenue du Plateau leads up a gentle incline to  the Law Courts in which once a week sits the Court of Premiere Instance.  Near by is the prison and the terminus of the tramway. From the summit  of the hill a grand view is obtained of the river winding between the  hills to the East, and at one's feet is a native village nestling in a  valley, for the natives dislike wind and cold almost as much as they do  rain. Separated from it is another native village in which the  Government has placed the educated people who can read and write and  many are now ambitions to qualify for admission.    It is now time to return to dinner with Mr. Vandamme where we meet Mr.  Gohr, the Director of Justice, and Mr. Underwood. Everyone here dines in  white, which is both cool and picturesque. Our host has an excellent  native cook who gives us some very good vegetable soup, one of the  numerous Congo fishes, all of which are nice, a very tender chicken, an  excellent salad and a well made omelette, all of which are products of  the country. Flour and butter have however, to be imported, as no wheat  will grow in this part of the country and the cows give scarcely enough  milk for their calves. Everyone retires and rises early, so at 9 p.m. we  seek our house guided by a boy with a lantern, for most of the streets  of Boma are not lighted artificially.    Next day we call on Mr. Nightingale who is at present acting as British  Consul. The consulate is about a mile from the town situated on the  banks of the river and is well constructed of wood. Mr. Nightingale  offers kindly to lend us any assistance on our voyage that we may  require. Afterwards we buy many things which will be necessary up  country, among which are bags of salt, a very popular form of money in  some parts, and tins of petrol for the lanterns.    Everyone in Boma works hard, from the Secretaire General who is at his  office from 7 a.m. to midday and from 2.30 to 5 p.m. to the hardy  healthy-looking native who wields his pick as he chats with his fellows.  Roads are being made and gardens laid out in various places. One very  noticeable feature of the natives here, is that they nearly all bear  wellmarked vaccination marks. Here and there a policeman patrols in an  effective costume of blue and red and armed with a short sword.  Everywhere is order, method, and cleanliness, and it is very difficult  to realise that a quarter of a century ago only three trading houses  stood on the site of this prosperous and well-regulated little town. In  the evening we dined with the Governor General who has both a good cook  and butler; the wines being excellent. Outside, the band of the Force  Publique played selections of music, rendered the more interesting by  the fact that not one of the players could read a note of music and each  learnt his part entirely by ear. Most of the guests were our fellow  travellers and well known to us. The conversation turned upon the  Sleeping Sickness, Beri Beri, the difficulty of growing wheat in the  Congo, and the climate. It is not very hot in Boma about this time, for  it is the winter or dry season and the nights are so cold that only the  very hardy mosquitoes are sufficiently wide awake to prevent people  sleeping. Still it is hotter, than we ever experience in England, and  with forethought for the comfort of his guests, Mr. Costermans usually  commands white costumes instead of European dress.    The native hospital is a newly-built stone and brick structure and is  under the charge of an Italian, Dr. Zerbini. The wards are well arranged  in separate wings, permitting good ventilation and isolation. The beds  are iron with bamboos stretched lengthwise, thus forming a kind of  spring mattress. There are many cases of Sleeping Sickness in the  hospital exhibiting various symptoms. In the early stages the patient  has many fits of emotional excitement and these alternate with periods  of physical and mental languor. Afterwards he lies for weeks or months  as if dead and can only be persuaded to eat with great difficulty.  Ultimately complete coma supervenes. A motile bacillus has been  discovered which is supposed to cause the disease and there is evidence  that this may be carried by a mosquito or fly, but until the discoveries  of the doctors, sent out by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,  are published, it is premature to give an opinion. Up to the present  many remedies have been prescribed without success. There is no small  pox and little phthisis, and it is interesting to learn that  appendicitis is unknown in Africa. Rupture is very common among the  natives and venereal diseases are frequent.    As I was destined to become well acquainted with the _Croix rouge_, the  hospital for Europeans, I will describe this institution later. On the  reverse slope of the central hill of Boma are the quarters of the army,  the Force Publique. The soldiers are fine looking fellows with a very  pretty uniform; blue wide cut breeches to the knee, the legs and feet  being bare, blue shirt with red facings and belt, and a red fez. They  are armed with Albini rifles, a very strong weapon which will stand any  amount of rough usage. Everything is scrupulously clean and the married  quarters especially look very comfortable. Each couple has a room fitted  with bed, table and chairs. They are recruited from all over the country  and the service is so popular that in many parts far more men volunteer  to serve than are required. The force does not exceed 13,600 in number  and is recruited for long or short service.    The prison is situated on the plateau in an open, airy place. The  building is constructed of iron plates and the separate cells and rooms  are lofty and clean. There are one or two Europeans here who have been  sentenced for theft or for cruelty to natives, for the State is  determined that all its subjects should be well treated. These are of  course kept entirely separate from the natives. Only the natives who  have been sentenced to more than one year are sent here and then after a  time they are forwarded to the penal settlements. Some are cannibals,  but most are thieves, and all wear light chains. It is somewhat warm  walking about Boma but there is no alternative, for there are no  carriages and only a horse or two for the Governor General. The State  regulates very strictly the importation of arms. Permission has to be  obtained from the Governor General before any fire arms can be landed;  then each one is stamped on the butt with the Star of the State and a  number which is registered. If anyone in the country wishes to purchase  a weapon from another, both buyer and seller have to obtain permission  from the Governor General. These laws are very excellent for they  effectually keep modern weapons out of the hands of the natives. Having  complied with the regulations and declared our ammunition, our rifles  and guns are"]]]
