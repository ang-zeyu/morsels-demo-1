Everywhere, when the inundation begins, the inhabitants are seen  hurrying their cattle to the shelter provided in the villages, and, if  the rise of the water is more rapid than usual, numbers rescue their  beasts with difficulty, causing them to wade or swim, or even saving  them by means of boats. An excessive inundation brings not only animal,  but human life into peril, endangering the villages themselves, which  may be submerged and swept away if the water rises above a certain  height. A deficient inundation, on the other hand, brings no immediate  danger, but by limiting production may create a dearth that causes  incalculable suffering.    Nature's operations are, however, so uniform that these calamities  rarely arise. Egypt rejoices, more than almost any other country, in an  equable climate, an equable temperature, and an equable productiveness.  The summers, no doubt, are hot, especially in the south, and an  occasional sirocco produces intense discomfort while it lasts. But the  cool Etesian wind, blowing from the north through nearly all the  summer-time, tempers the ardour of the sun's rays even in the hottest  season of the year; and during the remaining months, from October to  April, the climate is simply delightful. Egypt has been said to have but  two seasons, spring and summer. Spring reigns from October into  May--crops spring up, flowers bloom, soft zephyrs fan the cheek, when it  is mid-winter in Europe; by February the fruit-trees are in full  blossom; the crops begin to ripen in March, and are reaped by the end of  April; snow and frost are wholly unknown at any time; storm, fog, and  even rain are rare. A bright, lucid atmosphere rests upon the entire  scene. There is no moisture in the air, no cloud in the sky; no mist  veils the distance. One day follows another, each the counterpart of the  preceding; until at length spring retires to make room for summer, and a  fiercer light, a hotter sun, a longer day, show that the most enjoyable  part of the year is gone by.    The geology of Egypt is simple. The entire flat country is alluvial. The  hills on either side are, in the north, limestone, in the central region  sandstone, and in the south granite and syenite. The granitic formation  begins between the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth parallels, but  occasional masses of primitive rock are intruded into the secondary  regions, and these extend northward as far as lat. 27 deg.10'. Above the  rocks are, in many places, deposits of gravel and sand, the former hard,  the latter loose and shifting. A portion of the eastern desert is  metalliferous. Gold is found even at the present day in small  quantities, and seems anciently to have been more abundant. Copper,  iron, and lead have been also met with in modern times, and one iron  mine shows signs of having been anciently worked. Emeralds abound in the  region about Mount Zabara, and the eastern desert further yields  jaspers, carnelians, breccia verde, agates, chalcedonies, and  rock-crystal.    The flora of the country is not particularly interesting. Dom and date  palms are the principal trees, the latter having a single tapering stem,  the former dividing into branches. The sycamore (_Ficus sycamorus_) is  also tolerably common, as are several species of acacia. The acacia  seyal, which furnishes the gum arable of commerce, is \"a gnarled and  thorny tree, somewhat like a solitary hawthorn in its habit and manner  of growth, but much larger.\" Its height, when full grown, is from  fifteen to twenty feet. The _persea_, a sacred plant among the ancient  Egyptians, is a bushy tree or shrub, which attains the height of  eighteen or twenty feet under favourable circumstances, and bears a  fruit resembling a date, with a subacid flavour. The bark is whitish,  the branches gracefully curved, the foliage of an ashy grey, more  especially on its under surface. Specially characteristic of Egypt,  though not altogether peculiar to it, were the papyrus and the  lotus--the _Cyperus papyrus_ and _Nymphaea lotus_ of botanists. The  papyrus was a tall smooth reed, with a large triangular stalk containing  a delicate pith, out of which the Egyptians manufactured their paper.  The fabric was excellent, as is shown by its continuance to the present  day, and by the fact that the Greeks and Romans, after long trial,  preferred it to parchment. The lotus was a large white water-lily of  exquisite beauty. Kings offered it to the gods; guests wore it at  banquets; architectural forms were modelled upon it; it was employed in  the ornamentation of thrones. Whether its root had the effect on men  ascribed to it by Homer may be doubted; but no one ever saw it without  recognizing it instantly as \"a thing of beauty,\" and therefore as \"a joy  for ever.\"    [Illustration: DOM AND DATE PALMS.]    Nor can Egypt have afforded in ancient times any very exciting amusement  to sportsmen. At the present day gazelles are chased with hawk and hound  during the dry season on the broad expanse of the Delta; but anciently  the thick population scared off the whole antelope tribe, which was  only to be found in the desert region beyond the limits of the alluvium.  Nor can Egypt, in the proper sense of the word, have ever been the home  of red-deer, roes, or fallow-deer, of lions, bears, hyaenas, lynxes, or  rabbits. Animals of these classes may occasionally have appeared in the  alluvial plain, but they would only be rare visitants driven by hunger  from their true habitat in the Libyan or the Arabian uplands. The  crocodile, however, and the hippopotamus were actually hunted by the  ancient Egyptians; and they further indulged their love of sport in the  pursuits of fowling and fishing. All kinds of waterfowl are at all  seasons abundant in the Nile waters, and especially frequent the pools  left by the retiring river--pelicans, geese, ducks, ibises, cranes,  storks, herons, dotterels, kingfishers, and sea-swallows. Quails also  arrive in great numbers in the month of March, though there are no  pheasants, snipe, wood-cocks, nor partridges. Fish are very plentiful in  the Nile and the canals derived from it; but there are not many kinds  which afford much sport to the fisherman.    Altogether, Egypt is a land of tranquil monotony. The eye commonly  travels either over a waste of waters, or over a green plain unbroken by  elevations. The hills which inclose the Nile valley have level tops, and  sides that are bare of trees, or shrubs, or flowers, or even mosses. The  sky is generally cloudless. No fog or mist enwraps the distance in  mystery; no rainstorm sweeps across the scene; no rainbow spans the  empyrean; no shadows chase each other over the landscape. There is an  entire absence of picturesque scenery. A single broad river, unbroken  within the limits of Egypt even by a rapid, two flat strips of green  plain at its side, two low lines of straight-topped hills beyond them,  and a boundless open space where the river divides itself into half a  dozen sluggish branches before reaching the sea, constitute Egypt, which  is by nature a southern Holland---\"weary, stale, flat and unprofitable.\"  The monotony is relieved, however, in two ways, and by two causes.  Nature herself does something to relieve it Twice a day, in the morning  and in the evening, the sky and the landscape are lit up by hues so  bright yet so delicate, that the homely features of the prospect are at  once transformed as by magic, and wear an aspect of exquisite beauty. At  dawn long streaks of rosy light stretch themselves across the eastern  sky, the haze above the western horizon blushes a deep red; a ruddy  light diffuses itself around, and makes walls and towers and minarets  and cupolas to glow like fire; the long shadows thrown by each tree and  building are purple or violet. A glamour is over the scene, which seems  transfigured by an enchanter's wand; but the enchanter is Nature, and  the wand she wields is composed of sun-rays. Again, at eve, nearly the  same effects are produced as in the morning, only with a heightened  effect; \"the redness of flames\" passes into \"the redness of roses\"--the  wavy cloud that fled in the morning comes into sight once more--comes  blushing, yet still comes on--comes burning with blushes, and clings to  the Sun-god's side.[3]    Night brings a fresh transfiguration. The olive after-glow gives place  to a deep blue-grey. The yellow moon rises into the vast expanse. A  softened light diffuses itself over earth and sky. The orb of night  walks in brightness through a firmament of sapphire; or, if the moon is  below the horizon, then the purple vault is lit up with many-coloured  stars. Silence profound reigns around. A phase of beauty wholly  different from that of the day-time smites the sense; and the monotony  of feature is forgiven to the changefulness of expression, and to the  experience of a new delight.    Man has also done his part to overcome the dulness and sameness that  brood over the \"land of Mizraim.\" Where nature is most tame and  commonplace, man is tempted to his highest flights of audacity. As in  the level Babylonia he aspired to build a tower that should \"reach to  heaven\" (Gen. xi. 4), so in Egypt he strove to startle and surprise by  gigantic works, enormous undertakings, enterprises that might have  seemed wholly beyond his powers. And these have constituted in all ages,  except the very earliest, the great attractiveness of Egypt. Men are  drawn there, not by the mysteriousness of the Nile, or the mild beauties  of orchards and palm-groves, of well-cultivated fields and gardens--no,  nor by the loveliness of sunrises and sunsets, of moonlit skies and  stars shining with many hues, but by the huge masses of the pyramids, by  the colossal statues, the tall obelisks, the enormous temples, the  deeply-excavated tombs, the mosques, the castles, and the palaces.

Names of _Rivers_, _Winds_, and _Months_ are Masculine; as,--      Sequana, _Seine_; Eurus, _east wind_; Aprilis, _April_.    2. Names of _Trees_, and such names of _Towns_ and _Islands_ as end in -us,  are Feminine; as,--      quercus, _oak_; Corinthus, _Corinth_; Rhodus, _Rhodes_.    Other names of towns and islands follow the gender of their endings (see  _B_, below); as,--      Delphi, n.; Leuctra, n.; Tibur, n.; Carthago, f.    3. Indeclinable nouns, also infinitives and phrases, are Neuter; as,--      nihil, _nothing_; nefas, _wrong_; amare, _to love_.    NOTE.--Exceptions to the above principles sometimes occur; as, Allia (the  river), f.    _B. Gender determined by Ending of Nominative Singular._    The gender of other nouns is determined by the ending of the Nominative  Singular.[11]    NOTE 1.--_Common Gender._ Certain nouns are sometimes Masculine, sometimes  Feminine. Thus, sacerdos may mean either _priest_ or _priestess_, and is  Masculine or Feminine accordingly. So also civis, _citizen_; parens,  _parent_; etc. The gender of such nouns is said to be _common_.    NOTE 2.--Names of animals usually have grammatical gender, according to the  ending of the Nominative Singular, but the one form may designate either  the male or female; as, anser, m., _goose_ or _gander_. So vulpes, f.,  _fox_; aquila, f., _eagle_.    NUMBER.    16. The Latin has two Numbers,--the Singular and Plural. The Singular  denotes one object, the Plural, more than one.    CASES.    17. There are six Cases in Latin:--      Nominative,     Case of Subject;    Genitive,       Objective with _of_, or Possessive;    Dative,         Objective with _to_ or _for_;    Accusative,     Case of Direct Object;    Vocative,       Case of Address;    Ablative,       Objective with _by_, _from_, _in_,                    _with_.    1. LOCATIVE. Vestiges of another case, the Locative (denoting place where),  occur in names of towns and in a few other words.    2. OBLIQUE CASES. The Genitive, Dative, Accusative, and Ablative are called  Oblique Cases.    3. STEM AND CASE-ENDINGS. The different cases are formed by appending  certain case-endings to a fundamental part called the Stem.[12] Thus,  _portam_ (Accusative Singular) is formed by adding the case-ending -m to  the stem porta-. But in most cases the final vowel of the stem has  coalesced so closely with the actual case-ending that the latter has become  more or less obscured. The _apparent case-ending_ thus resulting is called  a termination.    THE FIVE DECLENSIONS.    18. There are five Declensions in Latin, distinguished from each other by  the final letter of the Stem, and also by the Termination of the Genitive  Singular, as follows:--      DECLENSION.     FINAL LETTER OF STEM.   GEN. TERMINATION.    First           a                       -ae    Second          o                       -i    Third           i / Some consonant      -is    Fourth          u                       -us    Fifth           e                       -ei / -ei    Cases alike in Form.    19. 1. The Vocative is regularly like the Nominative, except in the  singular of nouns in -us of the Second Declension.    2. The Dative and Ablative Plural are always alike.    3. In Neuters the Accusative and Nominative are always alike, and in the  Plural end in -a.    4. In the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Declensions, the Accusative Plural is  regularly like the Nominative.           *       *       *       *       *    FIRST DECLENSION.    a-Stems.    20. Pure Latin nouns of the First Declension regularly end, in the  Nominative Singular, in -a, weakened from -a, and are of the Feminine  Gender. They are declined as follows:--                       Porta, _gate_; stem, porta-.                                SINGULAR.         CASES.                 MEANINGS.

The Latin has no article, and porta may mean either _a gate_ or _the  gate_; and in the Plural, _gates_ or _the gates_.    Peculiarities of Nouns of the First Declension.    21. 1. EXCEPTIONS IN GENDER. Nouns denoting males are Masculine; as, nauta,  _sailor_; agricola, _farmer_; also, Hadria, _Adriatic Sea_.    2. Rare Case-Endings,--      a) An old form of the Genitive Singular in -as is preserved in the    combination pater familias, _father of a family_; also in mater familias,    filius familias, filia familias. But the regular form of the Genitive in    -ae is also admissible in these expressions; as, pater familiae.      b) In poetry a Genitive in -ai also occurs; as, aulai.      c) The Locative Singular ends in -ae; as, Romae, _at Rome_.      d) A Genitive Plural in -um instead of -arum sometimes occurs; as,    Dardanidum instead of Dardanidarum. This termination -um is not a    contraction of -arum, but represents an entirely different case-ending.      e) Instead of the regular ending -is, we usually find -abus in the Dative    and Ablative Plural of dea, _goddess_, and filia, _daughter_, especially    when it is important to distinguish these nouns from the corresponding    forms of deus, _god_, and filius, _son_. A few other words sometimes have    the same peculiarity; as, libertabus (from liberta, _freedwoman_),    equabus (_mares_), to avoid confusion with libertis (from libertus,    _freedman_) and equis (from equus, _horse_).    Greek Nouns.    22. These end in -e (Feminine); -as and -es (Masculine). In the Plural they  are declined like regular Latin nouns of the First Declension. In the  Singular they are declined as follows:--              Archias,           Epitome,           Cometes, _comet_.            _Archias_.         _epitome_.    _Nom._  Archias            epitome            cometes    _Gen._  Archiae            epitomes           cometae    _Dat._  Archiae            epitomae           cometae    _Acc._  Archiam (or -an)   epitomen           cometen    _Voc._  Archia             epitome            comete (or -a)    _Abl._  Archia             epitome            comete (or -a)    1. But most Greek nouns in -e become regular Latin nouns in -a, and are  declined like porta; as, grammatica, _grammar_; musica, _music_; rhetorica,  _rhetoric_.    2. Some other peculiarities occur, especially in poetry.           *       *       *       *       *    SECOND DECLENSION.    o-Stems.    23. Pure Latin nouns of the Second Declension end in -us, -er, -ir,  Masculine; -um, Neuter. Originally -us in the Nominative of the Masculine  was -os; and -um of the Neuters -om. So also in the Accusative.    Nouns in -us and -um are declined as follows:--              Hortus, _garden_;    Bellum, _war_;            stem, horto-.        stem, bello-.

Note that in words of the type of puer and vir the final vowel of the  stem has disappeared in the Nominative and Vocative Singular.    In the Nominative and Vocative Singular of ager, the stem is further  modified by the development of e before r.    2. The following nouns in -er are declined like puer: adulter, _adulterer_;  gener, _son-in-law_; Liber, _Bacchus_; socer, _father-in-law_; vesper,  _evening_; and compounds in -fer and -ger, as signifer, armiger.    Nouns in _-vus_, _-vum_, _-quus_.    24.
