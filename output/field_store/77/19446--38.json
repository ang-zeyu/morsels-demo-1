To detect the cause and degree of defects of the eyes it is  necessary to try out the eyes by using a trial spectacle frame and  inserting detached lenses before the right eye and the left eye  alternately. One of the most common forms of defective vision is  astigmatism. A chart has been designed with a series of circles and  straight lines radiating from the center. If the subject is astigmatic  he will see some of the straight lines distinctly while others will be  blurred. For instance, one or two of the vertical lines may appear  very black and strong while all others will look like a hazy network.  This defect, due to unevenness of the spherical surface of the  eyeball, is easily corrected with properly ground glasses.    Defects in hearing can be easily determined by means of an  \"acoumeter.\" This little instrument measures the acuteness of the  hearing very accurately by means of shot dropped from varying heights  upon strips of glass, copper and cardboard. Tests with this device  indicate whether the subject's hearing is above or below normal.    [Sidenote: _Mental Friction and Inner Whirlwinds_]    _Stop wasting your energy._    Heretofore you have used your powers in a more or less haphazard way,  with a vast amount of waste and no efficient direction. From now on  you are to exercise more intelligence in this respect and make all  your energies contribute to your business progress and your personal  success.    You are losing power in fruitless outward activities.    You are losing power in the thinking of useless thoughts. You cannot  stop the ceaseless activity of the mind. But you can conserve its  forces by directing them into channels that are worth while.    You are losing power in a turmoil of inward mental strains and  inharmonies. Catch yourself at some moment when you are forging ahead  in a crowded day's work. You will then see what an inner whirlwind of  excitement is in progress, what stresses and strains are at work, what  contrary impulses, what frictions and obstacles are being overcome.    Now, to the engineer every one of these words--friction, obstacle,  strain--spells loss of efficiency, and in this _Course_ we shall teach  you how you may do away with antagonistic impulses, may bring your  combined mental forces to bear upon the common enemy, and may hurl  yourself into the struggles of business and practical life with a  joyful and headlong impetuosity that no obstacle can withstand.    [Sidenote: _Prominent Traits of Great Achievers_]    Professor Walter Dill Scott, of Northwestern University, has said: \"In  studying the lives of contemporary business men, two facts stand out  pre-eminently. The first is that their labors have brought about  results that to most of us would have seemed impossible. Such men  appear as giants in comparison with whom ordinary men sink to the size  of pygmies. The second fact, which a study of successful business men  (or any class of successful men) reveals, is that they never seem  rushed for time.    \"Such men have time to devote to objects in no way connected with  their business. It cannot be regarded as accidental that this  characteristic of mind is found so commonly among successful men  during the years of their most fruitful labor. According to the  American ideal, the man who is sure to succeed is the one who is  continuously 'keyed up to concert pitch'--who is ever alert and is  always giving attention to his business or profession.\"    And again: \"It is not necessarily true that the greatest and most  constant display of energy accompanies the greatest presence of  energy. The tug-boat on the river is constantly blowing off steam and  making a tremendous display of energy, while the ocean liner proceeds  on its way without noise and without commotion. The man who frets and  fumes, who is nervous and excited, is strung up to such a pitch that  energy is being dissipated in all directions.\"    Many business men know they are going at a pace that kills, and at the  same time they feel that they are accomplishing too little. For such  the pertinent question is, How may I reduce the expenditure of energy  without reducing the efficiency of my labor?    One of the busiest and most efficient men in England is quoted as  having explained his own accomplishment of big results with the least  expenditure of effort: \"By organizing myself to run smoothly, as well  as my business; by schooling myself to keep cool, and to do what I  have to do without expending more nervous energy on the task than is  necessary; by avoiding all needless friction. In consequence, when I  finish my day's work, I feel nearly as fresh as when I started.\"    [Sidenote: _Why a Man Breaks Down_]    The late Professor James, of Harvard University, often referred to as  the founder of modern psychology, spoke thus disparagingly of  untrained effort: \"Your convulsive worker breaks down and has bad  moods so often that you never know where he may be when you most need  his help,--he may be having one of his 'bad days.' We say that so many  of our fellow-countrymen collapse and have to be sent abroad to rest  their nerves, because they work so hard. I suspect that this is an  immense mistake, I suspect that neither the nature nor the amount of  our work is accountable for the frequency and the severity of our  breakdowns, but that their cause lies rather in those absurd feelings  of hurry and having no time, in the breathlessness and tension, that  anxiety of feature and solicitude for results, that lack of inner  harmony and ease, in short, by which with us the work is apt to be  accompanied.\"    [Sidenote: _How to Economize Effort_]    The fact is that to be a truly busy man you must be never in a hurry.  You must work systematically. You must economize effort. You must  permit no distractions and do your work leisurely. You must take time  to think things over in a natural way. You must waste no thoughts in  business hours on social or pleasurable pursuits that would dissipate  your mental capital. You must work when you work, and you may play  when you play, but your business must be the most fascinating of games  and the only one you play during business hours.    [Sidenote: _How Your Mental Capital is Dissipated_]    Another thing you need is _poise_. One trouble with you now is that  you waste your priceless powers in useless anxiety.    The minute business falls off you begin to worry. You fritter your  mental energies in fretting until you are incapable of real thought,  and being unable to think your way out you get excited.    Remember it is all just a game, and you are in it only for the fun of  the thing. You will never win out if you persist in tearing your hair.    Before he crossed the Rubicon Julius Caesar was staggered at the  greatness of the undertaking before him. The more he reflected and  took counsel of his friends, the greater loomed the difficulties of  the attempt and the more appalling the calamities his passage of that  river would bring upon the Roman world. But when at last with the cry,  \"The die is cast!\" he plunged into the river, there was an end for him  to mental dissension, a freedom to plan and execute, an expansion of  courage and power.    [Sidenote: _Conquering Indecision_]    So it will be with you. With doubt and uncertainty the pressure may be  high in the gauge, but the engine does not move. Make up your mind,  and you release energies previously wasted in conflicts between  opposing thought complexes struggling for supremacy.    [Sidenote: _Why \"Christian Science\" Works_]    A fine illustration of this is shown in the religious experience known  as conversion. To the convert, conversion means the profound  acceptance of a mighty spiritual truth. It means positive knowledge  taking the place of doubt or indifference. Conflicting ideas are no  longer present in his consciousness. Pent-up energies are released. He  wants to do things. His soul is fired with overmastering impulses to  action. He wants to go forth and preach the gospel of his faith. He is  lifted to a high plane of exhilaration. He experiences the \"peace that  passeth understanding.\"    \"Christian Science,\" \"Truth,\" \"The New Thought,\" and similar movements  all achieve their really marvelous results in much the same way. All  proclaim doctrines of exuberant optimism, having a tendency to banish  fear-thoughts and self-consciousness and self-depreciation, and to set  up in their stead ideas of courage and of achievement and of  individual power. If these teachings are successful--that is to say,  if they inherently possess the right appeal for the particular  individual--they have the happy effect of begetting a stoical  indifference to petty physical disorders and social vexations and  bringing about a concentration upon the main business of life of the  mental energies thus previously wasted.    [Sidenote: _How to Release Pent-Up Power_]    Decide the matter that is troubling you. Make an end of hesitation and  uncertainty and fear. Your very act of decision will release large  stores of pent-up mental power and add immeasurably to your  effectiveness.    So long as you are in doubt and perplexity conflicting ideas and  impulses balance each other. You are not then a man of action; you are  a wavering coward. You are afflicted with paralysis of will and mental  stagnation.    _Decide_ the matter--that is to say, _let one mental picture assume a  greater vividness than the other until it possesses your soul--and  forthwith the banked fires of your mental energy will burst into  flame_.    Another thing: _Stop wasting your time_.    How much time do you spend in rest and relaxation? How much should  you spend? Can you answer these questions accurately?

He has conducted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17354"],[0,"Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills (#5)"],[1,"the  ancient excavation to receive it, and on careful inspection the  perpendicular lines, observed on the front, are found to be a set of  rather large organ pipes. A fresh fracture shows the Throne to be a most  beautiful white and gold onyx. The outer surface has now received a thin  coating of yellow clay which was, of course, regretted, but later  observations on onyx building reveals the pleasing fact that if the  crystal-bearing waters continue to drip, the yellow clay will supply the  coloring matter for a golden band of crystal.    The Throne is hollow and has a natural opening in one side by which it  may be entered, but the space within is too limited to invite a lengthy  stay. That portion of the outside which is nearest the wall is formed  with sufficient irregularity of outline to admit of an ascent to the  top, and the view obtained is well worth the difficult scramble up and  the apprehensive slide down. Being raised so high above all objects that  divide attention or in some degree obstruct the view, permits a freedom  of outlook that sensibly increases the appreciation of the vastness of  the enclosed chamber and its enclosing walls. Efforts to establish the  age of the deposit by observations on the yearly growth, would afford  little satisfaction, for the obvious reason that conditions governing  the growth are dependent, in a measure, on each season's vegetation.  Deposit began, of course, after the erosion of the chamber ceased, and  therefore represents only a fraction of the age of the cave itself.  About thirty feet west of the White Throne and against the wall, stands  the next onyx attraction in the form of a beautiful fluted column nearly  twenty feet high, tapering up from a base three feet in diameter, and  known as the Spring Room Sentinel, because the Spring of Youth is just  behind it although not directly connected with the Auditorium; it being  the first chamber on the left in Total Depravity Passage, a wet and  dangerous way of which next to nothing is known, but the entrance to  which is a fine arch a few feet west of the Sentinel. The Spring of  Youth is reached by climbing through a window-like opening, and is very  small, very wet, very cold, and very beautiful. It is not more than ten  feet high nor six in its greatest length and breadth, but every inch of  its irregular surface is composed of dripstone of a bright yellowish-red  and colorless crystal; and down the glittering walls trickles clear and  almost ice-cold water, to the onyx floor where it is caught and held in  a marvelous fluted bowl of its own manufacture. This is said to be the  gem of the whole cave and seems to have been placed where it is for the  consolation of those who are unable to enjoy the peculiar grandeur of  the Auditorium, and leave it as some actually are said to do, with a  sense of disappointment, because it is not the gleaming white hall of  marble which some writers for reputable journals have allowed their  imaginations to create.    In winter the Spring of Youth Room takes on a complete coating of ice,  with icicles of all sizes hanging from the ceiling and projections. The  effect is described as being wonderfully beautiful.    Further down Total Depravity Passage we were not urged to go, because at  that season of the year it is wet and difficult, without any sufficient  promise of a brilliant compensation for the achievement of such a  journey. But the Spring of Youth Room, or as it is generally called, the  Spring Room, is more than ample justification for the existence of the  passage, and would still be if that passage were several miles in length  and the attraction located at the most distant limit.    [Illustration: Wall in Spring Room. Page 32.]    The various passages in Marble Cave are by no means alike or even  similar; some having been opened by the action of water assisted only by  acid carried in solution; while others are the unmistakable crevices of  earthquake origin, afterwards enlarged, or perhaps only remodeled, as we  might say, by the water's untiring energy in changing the position of  rock masses without obliterating evidences of original design.    A glance at the map shows the sudden breaking off of the various  passages represented; the end, however, is not of the passages  themselves, but only of the exploration or the survey of them, and there  is a possibility that future developments will lead to the discovery of  more caves than are yet known. However that may be, the glimpses already  had into the beyond are said to be alluring.    To the north of the Auditorium, which was until recently called the  Grand Amphitheater, there opens out a kind of alcove extension known as  the Mother Hubbard Room, and spreading out from this is the corridor, a  room about one hundred and twenty-five feet long and seventy-five feet  in width, with a low, narrow passage, or crawl, leading from the  northeast into the Grotto, a dome-shaped room formerly called the  Battery, on account of the great number of bats that used to congregate  in it. It is about forty feet in diameter and fifty feet in height. On  one side of this room is a narrow \"squeeze\" opening into a passage  several feet lower than the floor level of the Grotto and leading to the  Spanish Room, which when discovered bore indications of having been  occupied by a human being who had tried to escape by tunneling, or by  reaching a hole in the roof; which is said to be impossible for him to  have done without outside assistance. As no bones have been found we may  hope the assistance arrived in time. When the discovery of the room was  made, a quantity of loose rock was piled before the entrance, so if he  ever escaped it was not by that way.    After crawling back to the Corridor, through the same small, but dry  passage of seventy feet length, we saw a narrow ledge of fine crystals,  a deposit of Epsom salts, and a few bats that in the dim light looked  white but are a light tan color with brown wings. A good specimen  hanging on a projecting ledge of the wall remained undisturbed by us and  our lights, giving an opportunity for careful inspection so that we  presently discovered it to be a mummy; which naturally suggests that  this portion of the cave, being dry and opening out of the great  temple-like Auditorium as an alcove, could be converted into an imposing  crypt.    Making our way across the room to its southwest extremity over a varied  assortment of bowlders and down a drop of eight or ten feet, we crawled  into another tight-fitting dry passage lined with beautiful glittering  onyx like clear ice banded with narrow lines of red, of which broken  fragments covered the narrow floor and made a dazzling, but  distressingly painful rug to crawl over. This is the West Passage and  leads to the Grand Crevice, of which only a small portion has been  surveyed; midway of the passage are the Epsom Rooms, two in number, and  well supplied with epsomite or native Epsom salts; this is sometimes  called the Windy Passage, on account of a rushing current of air met  suddenly at the first bend and, no doubt, due to the meeting here of  fresh air coming in from the outside with that chemically changed in the  Epsom Rooms.    The cave contains a great many dangerous places, as we correctly  surmised on the morning of our introduction; when Mr. Powell's blessing  on the breakfast was lost in so fervent a prayer for the safe and  successful accomplishment of our undertaking, it seemed inconsiderate  not to present the reassuring appearance of inexhaustible endurance.    In the Corridor can be seen one of the three old Spanish ladders found  in the cave when it was rediscovered; but when and for what purpose the  Spaniards used the cave there seems to be no means of finding out. It  should be remembered that this part of the United States was occupied  first by the Spaniards and then by the French, and is a portion of the  Louisiana Purchase, a tract of 897,931 square miles, or 70,000 square  miles more than the original thirteen states. The price asked and paid  was $12,000,000 and the assumption of claims which citizens of this  country had against the French Government for about $3,750,000 more. The  French offered to make the sale on account of being thoroughly  discouraged with constant troubles arising with the Indians, whom they  had decided it would be impossible to persuade or compel to recognize  any laws other than those established by each tribe for itself, or  accepted by friendly treaty with the council and disregarded by  individuals on both sides:--and the United States accepted the offer,  not for any expected value in the land, but for the unrestricted  navigation of the Mississippi River. Therefore Missouri was never under  British rule and never changed hands by force of arms.    But to return to the Spanish ladder, it is a tall pine tree notched on  the sides for steps, and the stump of a branch left or a peg inserted at  considerable intervals, for hand supports to assist in raising the  weight of the body.    Returning to the Auditorium, we entered a passage behind the Great White  Throne and started on what might well be called the Water Route, for no  dry spot is touched on the round trip; but if one goes prepared for  such a journey it is well worth the effort and the mud. If the visitor  is a man, the suit worn should be one he is ready to part with, or  overalls; ladies receive the same advice even to the overalls, as some  of the most beautiful portions of the cave, which we failed to see, can  be visited only in that objectionable costume. To visit any cave  comfortably a short dress is necessary and if any thing like a thorough  knowledge of the ramifications is desired, the unavoidable climbing will  soon prove the superior claims of a divided skirt; but if it is properly  made, only the wearer need be conscious of the divide. Rubber boots and  water-proof protection for the head "]]]
