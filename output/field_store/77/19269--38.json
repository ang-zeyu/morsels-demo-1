It comes from Switzerland in a hard,  truncated cone wrapped in a piece of paper that says:            To be used grated only          Genuine Swiss Green Cheese          Made of skimmed milk and herbs        To the housewives! Do you want a change in your meals? Try the      contents of this wrapper! Delicious as spreading mixed with butter,      excellent for flavoring eggs, macaroni, spaghetti, potatoes, soup,      etc. Can be used in place of any other cheese. _Do not take too      much, you might spoil the flavor_.    We put this wrapper among our papers, sealed it tight in an envelope,  and to this day, six months later, the scent of Sapsago clings 'round  it still.      Stilton         _Honor for Cheeses_         Literary and munching circles in London are putting quite a lot       of thought into a proposed memorial to Stilton cheese. There is a       Stilton Memorial Committee, with Sir John Squire at the head, and       already the boys are fighting.         One side, led by Sir John, is all for a monument.         This, presumably, would not be a replica of Stilton itself,       although Mr. Epstein could probably hack out a pretty effective       cheese-shaped figure and call it \"Dolorosa.\"         The monument-boosters plan a figure of Mrs. Paulet, who first       introduced Stilton to England. (Possibly a group showing Mrs.       Paulet holding a young Stilton by the hand and introducing it,       while the Stilton curtsies.)         T.S. Eliot does not think that anyone would look at a monument,       but wants to establish a Foundation for the Preservation of       Ancient Cheeses. The practicability of this plan would depend       largely on the site selected for the treasure house and the cost       of obtaining a curator who could, or would, give his whole time       to the work.         Mr. J.A. Symonds, who is secretary of the committee, agrees with       Mr. Eliot that a simple statue is not the best form.         \"I should like,\" he says, \"something irrelevant--gargoyles,       perhaps.\"         I think that Mr. Symonds has hit on something there.         I would suggest, if we Americans can pitch into this great       movement, some gargoyles designed by Mr. Rube Goldberg.         If the memorial could be devised so as to take on an       international scope, an exchange fellowship might be established       between England and America, although the exchange, in the case       of Stilton, would have to be all on England's side.         We might be allowed to furnish the money, however, while England       furnishes the cheese.         There is a very good precedent for such a bargain between the two       countries.         Robert Benchley, in _After 1903--What?_    When all seems lost in England there is still Stilton, an endless  after-dinner conversation piece to which England points with pride.  For a sound appreciation of this cheese see Clifton Fadiman's  introduction to this book.      Taleggio and Bel Paese    When the great Italian cheese-maker, Galbini, first exported Bel Paese  some years ago, it was an eloquent ambassador to America. But as the  years went on and imitations were made in many lands, Galbini deemed  it wise to set up his own factory in _our_ beautiful country. However,  the domestic Bel Paese and a minute one-pounder called Bel Paesino  just didn't have that old Alpine zest. They were no better than the  German copy called Schoenland, after the original, or the French Fleur  des Alpes.    Mel Fino was a blend of Bel Paese and Gorgonzola. It perked up the  market for a full, fruity cheese with snap. Then Galbini hit the  jackpot with his Taleggio that fills the need for the sharpest, most  sophisticated pungence of them all.      Trappist, Port-Salut, or Port du Salut, and Oka    In spite of its name Trappist is no rat-trap commoner. Always of the  elect, and better known as Port-Salut or Port du Salut from the  original home of the Trappist monks in their chief French abbey, it is  also set apart from the ordinary Canadians under the name of Oka, from  the Trappist monastery there. It is made by Trappist monks all over  the world, according to the original secret formula, and by Trappist  Cistercian monks at the Abbey of Gethsemani Trappist in Kentucky.    This is a soft cheese, creamy and of superb flavor. You can't go wrong  if you look for the monastery name stamped on, such as Harze in  Belgium, Mont-des-Cats in Flanders, Sainte Anne d'Auray in Brittany,  and so forth.    Last but not least, a commercial Port-Salut entirely without benefit  of clergy or monastery is made in Milwaukee under the Lion Brand. It  is one of the finest American cheeses in which we have ever sunk a  fang.          [Illustration]    _Chapter Four_    Native Americans      American Cheddars    The first American Cheddar was made soon after 1620 around Plymouth by  Pilgrim fathers who brought along not only cheese from the homeland  but a live cow to continue the supply. Proof of our ability to  manufacture Cheddar of our own lies in the fact that by 1790 we were  exporting it back to England.    It was called Cheddar after the English original named for the village  of Cheddar near Bristol. More than a century ago it made a new name  for itself, Herkimer County cheese, from the section of New York State  where it was first made best. Herkimer still equals its several  distinguished competitors, Coon, Colorado Blackie, California Jack,  Pineapple, Sage, Vermont Colby and Wisconsin Longhorn.    The English called our imitation Yankee, or American, Cheddar, while  here at home it was popularly known as yellow or store cheese from its  prominent position in every country store; also apple-pie cheese  because of its affinity for the all-American dessert.    The first Cheddar factory was founded by Jesse Williams in Rome, New  York, just over a century ago and, with Herkimer County Cheddar  already widely known, this established \"New York\" as the preferred  \"store-boughten\" cheese.    An account of New York's cheese business in the pioneer Wooden Nutmeg  Era is found in Ernest Elmo Calkins' interesting book, _They Broke the  Prairies_. A Yankee named Silvanus Ferris, \"the most successful  dairyman of Herkimer County,\" in the first decades of the 1800's  teamed up with Robert Nesbit, \"the old Quaker Cheese Buyer.\" They  bought from farmers in the region and sold in New York City. And  \"according to the business ethics of the times,\" Nesbit went ahead to  cheapen the cheese offered by deprecating its quality, hinting at a  bad market and departing without buying. Later when Ferris arrived in  a more optimistic mood, offering a slightly better price, the seller,  unaware they were partners, and ignorant of the market price, snapped  up the offer.    Similar sharp-trade tactics put too much green cheese on the market,  so those honestly aged from a minimum of eight months up to two years  fetched higher prices. They were called \"old,\" such as Old Herkimer,  Old Wisconsin Longhorn, and Old California Jack.    Although the established Cheddar ages are three, fresh, medium-cured,  and cured or aged, commercially they are divided into two and  described as mild and sharp. The most popular are named for their  states: Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Vermont and  Wisconsin. Two New York Staters are called and named separately, Coon  and Herkimer County. Tillamook goes by its own name with no mention of  Oregon. Pineapple, Monterey Jack and Sage are seldom listed as  Cheddars at all, although they are basically that.      Brick    Brick is the one and only cheese for which the whole world gives  America credit. Runners-up are Liederkranz, which rivals say is too  close to Limburger, and Pineapple, which is only a Cheddar under its  crisscrossed, painted and flavored rind. Yet Brick is no more  distinguished than either of the hundred percent Americans, and in our  opinion is less worth bragging about.    It is a medium-firm, mild-to-strong slicing cheese for sandwiches and  melting in hot dishes. Its texture is elastic but not rubbery, its  taste sweetish, and it is full of little round holes or eyes. All this  has inspired enthusiasts to liken it to Emmentaler. The most  appropriate name for it has long been \"married man's Limburger.\" To  make up for the mildness caraway seed is sometimes added.    About Civil War time, John Jossi, a dairyman of Dodge County,  Wisconsin, came up with this novelty, a rennet cheese made of whole  cow's milk. The curd is cut like Cheddar, heated, stirred and cooked  firm to put in a brick-shaped box without a bottom and with slits in  the sides to drain. When this is set on the draining table a couple of  bricks are also laid on the cooked curd for pressure. It is this  double use of bricks, for shaping and for pressing, that has led to  the confusion about which came first in originating the name.    The formed \"bricks\" of cheese are rubbed with salt for three days and  they ripen slowly, taking up to two months.    We eat several million pounds a year and 95 percent of that comes from  Wisconsin, with a trickle from New York.    Colorado Blackie Cheese    A subtly different American Cheddar is putting Colorado on our cheese  map. It is called Blackie from the black-waxed rind and it resembles  Vermont State cheese, although it is flatter. This is a proud new  American product, proving that although Papa Cheddar was born in  England his American kinfolk have developed independent and valuable  characters all on their own.      Coon Cheese    Coon cheese is full of flavor from being aged on shelves at a higher  temperature than cold storage. Its rind is darker from the growth of  mold and this shade is sometimes painted on more ordinary Cheddars to  make them look like Coon, which always brings a 10 percent premium  above the general run.

Stanley in this service.    That, in the early years, Leopold's interest in the Congo was  unselfish may or may not be granted, but, knowing him, as we now  know him, as one of the shrewdest and, of speculators, the most  unscrupulous, at the time of the Berlin Conference, his self-seeking  may safely be accepted. Quietly, unostentatiously, he presented  himself to its individual members as a candidate for the post of  administrator of this new territory.    On the face of it he seemed an admirable choice. He was a sovereign  of a kingdom too unimportant to be feared; of the newly created  State he undoubtedly possessed an intimate knowledge. He promised to  give to the Dutch, English, and Portuguese traders, already for many  years established on the Congo, his heartiest aid, and, for those  traders still to come, to maintain the \"open door.\" His professions  of a desire to help the natives were profuse. He became the  unanimous choice of the conference.    Later he announced to the Powers signing the act, that from Belgium  he had received the right to assume the title of King of the  Independent State of the Congo. The Powers recognized his new title.    The fact that Leopold, King of Belgium, was king also of the Etat  Independant du Congo confused many into thinking that the Free State  was a colony, or under the protection, of Belgium. As we have seen,  it is not. A Belgian may serve in the army of the Free State, or in  a civil capacity, as may a man of any nation, but, although with few  exceptions only Belgians are employed in the Free State, and  although to help the King in the Congo, the Belgian Government has  loaned him great sums of money, politically and constitutionally the  two governments are as independent of each other as France and  Spain.    And so, in 1885, Leopold, by the grace of fourteen governments, was  appointed their steward over a great estate in which each of the  governments still holds an equal right; a trustee and keeper over  twenty millions of \"black brothers\" whose \"moral and material  welfare\" each government had promised to protect.    There is only one thing more remarkable than the fact that Leopold  was able to turn this public market into a private park, and that  is, that he has been permitted to do so. It is true he is a man of  wonderful ability. For his own ends he is a magnificent organizer.  But in the fourteen governments that created him there have been,  and to-day there are, men, if less unscrupulous, of quite as great  ability; statesmen, jealous and quick to guard the rights of the  people they represent, people who since the twelfth century have  been traders, who since 1808 have declared slavery abolished.    And yet, for twenty-five years these statesmen have watched Leopold  disobey every provision in the act of the conference. Were they to  visit the Congo, they could see for themselves the jungle creeping  in and burying their trading posts, their great factories turned  into barracks. They know that the blacks they mutually agreed to  protect have been reduced to slavery worse than that they suffered  from the Arabs, that hundreds of thousands of them have fled from  the Congo, and that those that remain have been mutilated, maimed,  or, what was more merciful, murdered. And yet the fourteen  governments, including the United States, have done nothing.    Some tell you they do not interfere because they are jealous one of  the other; others say that it is because they believe the Congo will  soon be taken over by Belgium, and with Belgium in control, they  argue, they would be dealing with a responsible government, instead  of with a pirate. But so long as Leopold is King of Belgium one  doubts if Belgians in the Congo would rise above the level of their  King. The English, when asked why they do not assert their rights,  granted not only to them, but to thirteen other governments, reply  that if they did they would be accused of \"ulterior motives.\" What  ulterior motives? If you pursue a pickpocket and recover your watch  from him, are your motives in doing so open to suspicion?    Personally, although this is looking some way ahead, I would like to  see the English take over and administrate the Congo. Wherever I  visit a colony governed by Englishmen I find under their  administration, in spite of opium in China and gin on the West  Coast, that three people are benefited: the Englishman, the native,  and the foreign trader from any other part of the world. Of the  colonies of what other country can one say the same?    As a rule our present governments are not loath to protect their  rights. But toward asserting them in the Congo they have been moved  neither by the protests of traders, chambers of commerce,  missionaries, the public press, nor by the cry of the black man to  \"let my people go.\" By only those in high places can it be  explained. We will leave it as a curious fact, and return to the  \"Unjust Steward.\"    His first act was to wage wars upon the Arabs. From the Soudan and  from the East Coast they were raiding the Congo for slaves and  ivory, and he drove them from it. By these wars he accomplished two  things. As the defender of the slave, he gained much public credit,  and he kept the ivory. But war is expensive, and soon he pointed out  to the Powers that to ask him out of his own pocket to maintain  armies in the field and to administer a great estate was unfair. He  humbly sought their permission to levy a few taxes. It seemed a  reasonable request. To clear roads, to keep boats upon the great  rivers, to mark it with buoys, to maintain wood stations for the  steamers, to improve the \"moral and material welfare of the  natives,\" would cost money, and to allow Leopold to bring about  these improvements, which would be for the good of all, he was  permitted to levy the few taxes. That was twenty years ago; to-day I  saw none of these improvements, and the taxes have increased.    From the first they were so heavy that the great trade houses, which  for one hundred years in peace and mutual goodwill bartered with the  natives, found themselves ruined. It was not alone the export taxes,  lighterage dues, port dues, and personal taxes that drove them out  of the Congo; it was the King appearing against them as a rival  trader, the man appointed to maintain the \"open door.\" And a trader  with methods they could not or would not imitate. Leopold, or the  \"State,\" saw for the existence of the Congo only two reasons: Rubber  and Ivory. And the collecting of this rubber and ivory was, as he  saw it, the sole duty of the State and its officers. When he threw  over the part of trustee and became the Arab raider he could not  waste his time, which, he had good reason to fear, might be short,  upon products that, if fostered, would be of value only in later  years. Still less time had he to give to improvements that cost  money and that would be of benefit to his successors. He wanted only  rubber; he wanted it at once, and he cared not at all how he  obtained it. So he spun, and still spins, the greatest of all  \"get-rich-quick\" schemes; one of gigantic proportions, full of  tragic, monstrous, nauseous details.    The only possible way to obtain rubber is through the native; as  yet, in teeming forests, the white man can not work and live. Of  even Chinese coolies imported here to build a railroad ninety per  cent. died. So, with a stroke of the pen, Leopold declared all the  rubber in the country the property of the \"State,\" and then, to make  sure that the natives would work it, ordered that taxes be paid in  rubber. If, once a month (in order to keep the natives steadily at  work the taxes were ordered to be paid each month instead of once a  year), each village did not bring in so many baskets of rubber the  King's cannibal soldiers raided it, carried off the women as  hostages, and made prisoners of the men, or killed and ate them. For  every kilo of rubber brought in in excess of the quota the King's  agent, who received the collected rubber and forwarded it down the  river, was paid a commission. Or was \"paid by results.\" Another  bonus was given him based on the price at which he obtained the  rubber. If he paid the native only six cents for every two pounds,  he received a bonus of three cents, the cost to the State being but  nine cents per kilo, but, if he paid the natives twelve cents for  every two pounds, he received as a bonus less than one cent. In a  word, the more rubber the agent collected the more he personally  benefited, and if he obtained it \"cheaply\" or for nothing--that is,  by taking hostages, making prisoners, by the whip of hippopotamus  hide, by torture--so much greater his fortune, so much richer  Leopold.     [Illustration: A Village on the Kasai River.]    Few schemes devised have been more cynical, more devilish, more  cunningly designed to incite a man to cruelty and abuse. To  dishonesty it was an invitation and a reward. It was this system of  \"payment by results,\" evolved by Leopold sooner than allow his  agents a fixed and sufficient wage, that led to the atrocities.    One result of this system was that in seven years the natives  condemned to slavery in the rubber forests brought in rubber to the  amount of fifty-five millions of dollars. But its chief results were  the destruction of entire villages, the flight from their homes in  the Congo of hundreds of thousands of natives, and for those that  remained misery, death, the most brutal tortures and degradations,  unprintable, unthinkable.    I am not going to enter into the question of the atrocities. In the  Congo the tip has been given out from those higher up at Brussels to  \"close up\" the atrocities; and for the present the evil places in  the Tenderloin and along the"]]]
