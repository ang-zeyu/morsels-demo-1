Then they worshipped him, saying,  \"Truly Thou art the Son of God.\" And they came into the land of  Gennesaret, where the people knew Him and brought to Him all that were  sick, or blind, or lame, that they might touch His garment and be made  well.    [Illustration: CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.]          THE WOMAN OF CANAAN.      Jesus came unto the borders of Tyre and Sidon, where the people were  not Jews, but Gentiles. And there came to Him a woman of Canaan, who  cried out to Him, saying, \"Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou son of  David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.\" She besought Him  to cast out this evil spirit from her daughter. But He answered not a  word, and His disciples counselled Him to send her away. Then He told  her He was not sent unto the Gentiles, but unto the lost sheep of  Israel; meaning the Jews. This was said to try her faith. Then she  came and worshipped Him, saying, \"Lord, help me.\" But He said, \"It is  not meet to take the children's food and to cast it to dogs;\" meaning  that His help was due rather to the Jews than to the Gentiles. And she  said, \"Truth, Lord, yet the dogs sometimes eat of the crumbs which  fall from their masters' table;\" meaning that, though she was a  Gentile, she believed in Him as the Son of God.    Then Jesus answered, and said unto her, \"O woman, great is thy faith;  be it unto thee even as thou desirest. Go thy way; the devil has gone  out of thy daughter.\" And when she was come to her house she found her  daughter made whole and laid upon the bed.    Jesus, with His knowledge of our hearts, knew the faith this poor  woman had, and tried it so that it might shine the brighter. Then He  granted her the blessing she had asked Him for; and how she must have  rejoiced when she reached home and found her daughter quite well and  restored to her right mind.    [Illustration: THE WOMAN OF CANAAN.]          PETER AND THE TRIBUTE-MONEY.      It was a part of the Jewish law that all strangers passing among the  Jews should pay to the priests of the Temple an offering to the Lord,  or tribute-money as it was called.    Soon after our Lord's Transfiguration He came to Capernaum, together  with His disciples. When they had entered the city, there came to them  the priests who usually collected this tribute-money, and they said  unto Peter, \"Doth not thy Master pay tribute?\" And he answered, \"Yes.\"  But when they had come to the house, Jesus said to Peter, \"What  thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do they take tribute; of their own  people or of strangers?\" And Peter answered Him, \"Of strangers.\"    Jesus saith unto him, \"Then their own people are free; but lest we  should offend them by not paying, go thou down to the sea, and cast in  thy hook and line, and take up the first fish that taketh the hook  into his mouth. And when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a  piece of money there. Take it and give it unto the priests as tribute  for Me and for thee.\" And Peter went down to the sea and cast in his  line, and took a big fish. And when he had opened its mouth he found  the piece of silver, and took it to the men in payment of the tribute.    This tribute was collected to pay the expenses of the Temple worship.  Jesus sought to show that, as He himself was the Son of God, the King  for whose service the tribute was paid, He might justly be exempted  from paying it; yet to save giving offence He miraculously provided  the piece of money to pay tribute for Himself and Peter.    [Illustration: PETER AND THE TRIBUTE-MONEY.]          THE GOOD SAMARITAN.      As Jesus was talking to His disciples, a certain lawyer stood up and  asked, \"Who is my neighbour?\" And Jesus answered by telling them this  story:--    A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among  thieves, who robbed him, stripped him of his clothes, and, wounding  him, left him on the road half dead. By chance there came a priest  that way, and, as a teacher of religion to men, he should have stopped  to help the poor man. Instead of this, he pretended not to see, and  passed by on the other side of the road. Then there came by a Levite,  who also, as an official of the church, should have given help. But he  merely came and looked on the injured man, and passed on the other  side as the priest had done.    Afterwards there came by a Samaritan, and, when he caught sight of the  wounded Jew, he went over to him and was very sorry for him. Now the  Jews hated the Samaritans, and were their enemies, so that it would  not have been surprising if he, also, had done as the priest and the  Levite did. But, no! Though it was his enemy, he could not pass him by  and leave him on the road, perhaps to die. He examined his wounds and  bound them up; doing all that he could to soothe them. Then he lifted  him carefully on his own beast, and brought him to the nearest inn,  and took care of him through the night. The next day, when the  Samaritan departed, he paid the man who kept the inn, and said to him,  \"Take care of this poor man until he is well, and whatever it may cost  for his lodging and food, that I will pay thee when I come again.\"    \"Which of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell  among thieves?\" The lawyer answered, \"He that showed mercy unto him.\"  Then said Jesus, \"Go, and do thou likewise.\"    [Illustration: THE GOOD SAMARITAN.]          IMPORTUNITY REWARDED.      One day Jesus was asked by His disciples to teach them to pray. So  Jesus taught them the prayer we all know so well, beginning with \"Our  Father, which art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.\" But Jesus told  them it was not enough to pray: they must not get tired of praying,  even if they failed to receive quickly the things they asked for. They  must keep on asking, until God in His own time and manner should grant  them what He saw to be good. This great lesson Jesus taught them by  the following parable:--    \"Which of you shall have a friend,\" said Jesus, \"and shall go unto him  at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves, for a  friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set  before him? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not,  the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot  rise and give thee. I say unto you,\" said Jesus, \"though he will not  rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his  importunity (continued asking) he will rise and give him as many as he  needeth.\"    Then Jesus told His disciples, and He tells us too, \"Ask, and it shall  be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened  unto you.\" For, said He, \"every one that asketh receiveth; and he that  seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\" If we  ask for those things that God sees to be good for us, we may certainly  expect to receive them. Let us ask God to keep us every day; and to  give us such things as He knows will be for our good.    [Illustration: IMPORTUNITY REWARDED.]          THE UNMERCIFUL SERVANT.      A certain King took account of his servants and began to reckon what  they owed him. And there was brought to him one that owed him nearly  _ten million dollars_. But as he had not the money to pay, the King  commanded that he should be sold, together with his wife and children  and everything that he had, that payment might be made. Then the  servant fell down before the King and worshipped him, saying, \"Lord,  have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\" Then the King had  compassion on his servant, and loosed him, and forgave him his debt.    But when that servant had gone out from the presence of the King, he  found a fellow-servant who owed him a little over _fifteen dollars_,  and he laid hands on him and seized him by the throat, saying, \"Pay me  that which thou owest.\" And his fellow-servant fell down at his feet  and implored him, saying, \"Have patience with me, and I will pay thee  all.\" And he would not have patience, but cast his fellow-servant into  prison till he should pay the debt.    When his other fellow-servants saw what had been done they were very  sorry, and came to their King to tell him all about it. Then the King  called the unmerciful servant to him, and said, \"O thou wicked  servant; I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me.  Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant,  even as I had pity on thee?\"    And the King was wroth, and delivered him up to the tormentors, till  he should pay all that was due unto him.    So likewise, says Christ, shall our Heavenly Father do also unto us if  from our hearts we forgive not every one that trespasses against us.      \"Forgive us our trespasses, _as we forgive them that trespass    against us_.\"    [Illustration: THE UNMERCIFUL SERVANT.]          THE GOOD SHEPHERD.      In one of His beautiful parables, Jesus compares Himself to a  shepherd. \"I am the good shepherd,\" says He, \"the good shepherd giveth  his life for the sheep.\" And Jesus tells how the hired servant who  cares for nothing but his wages, runs away when the wolf comes; but  how the faithful shepherd, when robbers threaten his flock, or wild  beasts attack them, defends his sheep bravely, often laying down his  life for their sake. Jesus also speaks of how the shepherd knows his  sheep by name; and how, when he goes before them, they will follow  him, because they know his voice, but that they will not follow  strangers. And the Bible, speaking of Jesus Himself, says, \"He shall  carry the lambs in His bosom,\" or His arms, like the kind shepherd is  doing in our picture.    Now, why does Jesus call Himself the \"good shepherd,\" and the Bible  speak of Him as carrying the little lambs? Is it not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17164"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#5)"],[1,"  of the authorities of Malta with whom I have been in communication; they  have all done their best to forward the objects of the Mission.    A good deal of the delay that took place at Tripoli arose from causes  over which it was impossible to exert any control, and principally from  the bad weather, which cut off all communication with Malta. We used to  go about relating the anecdote of Charles V. illustrative of the  inhospitable seasons of this coast. \"Which are the best ports of  Barbary?\" inquired the Emperor of the famous Admiral Dorea. \"The months  of June, July, and August,\" was the reply.    Whilst waiting for the winds to waft us so many desirable things, we  actively engaged in hiring camels, procuring servants, and otherwise  making ready for a start. The details of all these preparations, which  cost me prodigious anxiety, as I was obliged to study at the same time  efficiency and economy, are described in a voluminous mass of  correspondence; but I should not think of presenting them to the general  public, which will be satisfied probably to know that at length  everything was found to be in due order, and our long-expected departure  was fixed for the 30th of March.    I had taken care, immediately on my arrival at Tripoli, to write to Mr.  Gagliuffi, the British Consul at Mourzuk, announcing my approach and  enclosing a despatch from the Foreign Office. Moreover I had requested  this gentleman at once to send to Ghat for an escort of Tuaricks, so  that we might not be unnecessarily detained in Fezzan; and to suggest  that the Sheikhs should be assembled by the time we arrived, that the  treaty I had to propose to them might be discussed. My former visit to  this place will in some respects pave the way. Throughout the Turkish  provinces of Tripoli and Fezzan a circular letter given to us by Izhet  Pasha, and the letters of the Bey of Tunis in other quarters, will no  doubt prove of some assistance, although such documents must lose much  of their influence in the very secluded districts through which we shall  be compelled to pass. After all, we must trust principally to our own  tact, to the good will of the natives, and to that vague respect of  English power which is beginning to spread in the Sahara.    The composition of our caravan will of course fluctuate throughout the  whole line of route; but I may as well mention the most important  personages who were to start with me from Tripoli. Setting aside my  colleagues, Barth and Overweg, there was, in the first place, the  interpreter, Yusuf Moknee, a man really of some importance among his  people, but considering himself with far too extravagant a degree of  respect. He is the son of the famous Moknee, who was Governor of the  province of Fezzan during the period of the Karamanly Bashaws. He has  squandered his father's estate in intemperate drinking. Nevertheless I  have been recommended to take him as a dragoman, and give him a fair  trial, as his only vice really seems to be attachment to the bottle. I  suspect he will not find many opportunities of indulging his propensity  in the Sahara; so that, as long as he is _en route_, he may prove to be  that phenomenon, a man without a fault! At any rate I must be content  with him, especially as he is willing to sign a contract promising to be  a pattern of sobriety! There is no one else in Tripoli so suitable for  my purpose. He is a handsome, dark-featured fellow, and when in his  bright-blue gown, white burnoose, and elegant fez, makes a really  respectable figure. I must dress him up well for state occasions. Even  in the desert one is often judged by the livery of one's servants.    The individuals next in importance to Moknee are, perhaps, the  Chaouches, as they are called here--Arab cavaliers, who are to act as  janissaries. There is one big fellow for me, and one little fellow for  the Germans. How they will behave remains to be seen; but I suspect they  will give us some trouble. Then there are a number of free blacks from  Tunis, some married, others not, who are to return to their homes in  Soudan, Bornou, and Mandara, under our protection. Some of these have  agreed to travel partly on their own account, or nearly so, whilst  others will be paid and act as servants. One of them, named Ali, is a  fine, dashing young fellow. They are very unimportant people here, but  as we advance on our route will no doubt prove of some service,  especially when we fairly enter upon the Black Countries. A marabout of  Fezzan also accompanies us, and our camel-drivers are from the same  country. They arrived with a caravan from Mourzuk, and we were some time  detained by the necessity of allowing them and their beasts to rest  before recommencing their march over the very arduous country that lies  between this and the confines of Fezzan.    Our progress will necessarily be slow, as all travelling is in the  desert. Camels can rarely exceed three miles an hour, and often make but  two. We may calculate their average progress at two miles and a half, so  that the reader will be pleased to bear in mind, that when I speak of a  laborious day of twelve hours, he must not imagine us to have advanced  more than thirty miles.    Before commencing the narrative of my journey, it may be as well to  introduce a few observations on the commerce at present carried on with  the interior by way of Tripoli. In addition to the mere acquisition of  geographical, statistical, and other information, I look upon the great  object of our mission to be the promotion, by all prudent means, of  legitimate trade. This will be the most effectual way of putting a stop  to that frightful system by which all the Central Provinces of Africa  are depopulated, and all the littoral regions demoralized. When the  negro races begin to make great profits by exporting the natural  products of their country, they will then, and perhaps then only, cease  to export their brethren as slaves. On this account, therefore, I take  great interest in whatever has reference to caravan trade.    There are now four general routes followed by the trading caravans from  the Barbary coast, leading to four different points of that great belt  of populous country that stretches across Central Africa,--viz. to  Wadai, Bornou, Soudan, and Timbuctoo.    Wadai sends to the coast at Bengazi a biennial caravan, accompanied by a  large number of slaves. The chief articles of legitimate traffic are  elephants' teeth and ostrich feathers. This route is a modern  ramification of interior trade, and was opened only during the last  century. It is calculated that the exports of Bengazi form one-third of  the whole of those of Tripoli.    Bornou sends to the coast by way of Fezzan, I am sorry to say, chiefly  slaves; but a quantity of ivory is now likewise forwarded by this route.    Soudan exports slaves, senna, ivory, wax, indigo, skins, &c. &c. Nearly  half of the commerce with this important country consists of legitimate  articles of trade and barter. This is very encouraging, and the brief  history of some of these objects of legal commerce is exceedingly  interesting. Wax, for example, began to be sent seventeen years ago;  elephants' teeth, fifteen; and indigo, only four years ago.    Timbuctoo now scarcely forwards anything but gold to the coast of  Tripoli, together with wax and ivory, but no slaves. The gold is brought  by the merchants in diminutive roughly-made rings, which they often  carry in dirty little bags, concealed in the breasts of their gowns.    I am exceedingly glad to learn that the Ghadamsee merchants, who  formerly embarked two-thirds of their capital in the slave-trade, have  now only one-fourth engaged in that manner. This is progress. It has  been partly brought about by the closing of the Tunisian slave-mart,  partly by the increase of objects of legitimate commerce in the markets  of Soudan. The merchants of Fezzan have still to learn that money may be  invested to more advantage in things than in persons; but their  education has been undertaken, and however slow the light may be in  forcing its way to their eyes, it will reach them at last, there can be  no doubt.    The trade in senna is always considerable. Last year a thousand cantars  were brought, from the country of the Tibboos and from Aheer. The latter  place supplies the best. New objects of exportation may no doubt be  discovered. Already gum-dragon and cassia have been added to the list of  articles brought from Soudan; and when once treaties of commerce have  been entered into, and merchants begin to find security in the desert  and protection from the native princes, there is no doubt that a very  large intercourse may be established with the interior countries of  Africa--an intercourse that will at once prove of immense benefit to us  as a manufacturing nation, and advance materially that great object of  all honest men, the abolition of the accursed traffic in human beings.  It is the latter object that chiefly occupies my mind, but I shall not  attempt to bring it before the native princes in too abrupt a manner. In  some cases, indeed, to allude to it at all would be disastrous. The  promotion of legitimate traffic must, after all, be our great lever.    I do not profess in this place to do more than give a few hints on the  present state of trade in Tripoli, and the vast tract of half-desert  country on which it leans. What I have said is perhaps sufficient to  impart some idea of the nature of the relations between the Barbary  coast and the interior, and to suggest the importance of the enterprise  on which I am engaged. Briefly, the exportation of slaves to Tripoli and  beyond, in spite of certain changes of route, is as rife as ever, and in  this respect everything remains to be done. But, on the other hand, the  trade which, I trust, is providentially intended to supersede this  inhuman traffic, is on the increase, though slightly. If we can pave"]]]
