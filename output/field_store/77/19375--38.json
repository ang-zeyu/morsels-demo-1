[6] The above brochure consists of two Letters; each to an anonymous      bibliographical \"Confrere:\" one is upon the subject of M. Crapelet's      version--the other, upon that of M. Licquet's version--of a portion of      the Tour. The notice of the Works of the Author of the Tour; a list of      the prices for which the Books mentioned in it have been sold; a      Notice of the \"Hours of Charlemagne\" (see vol. ii. 199) and some      account of the late Mr. Porson \"Librarian of the London      Institution\"--form the remaining portion of this little volume of      about 160 pages. For the \"Curiosites Bibliographiques,\" consult the      _Bibliomania_, pp. 90, 91, &c. &c.    [7] This letter accompanied another Work of M. Peignot, relating to      editions and translations of the Roman Classics:--and as the reader      will find, in the ensuing pages, that I have been sometime past      labouring under the frightful, but popular, mania of AUTOGRAPHS, I      subjoin with no small satisfaction a fac-simile of the Autograph of      this enthusiastic and most diligent Bibliographer.        [Autograph: Votre tres humble et obeissant serviteur, G. Peignot]    [8] See page xviii.--ante.    [9] M. Licquet goes on to afford an exemplification of this precipitancy of      conjecture, in my having construed the word _Allemagne_--a village      near to Caen--by that of _Germany_. I refer the reader to p. 168 post,      to shew with what perfect frankness I have admitted and corrected this      \"_hippopotamos_\" error.    [10] More especially at pages 82, 100, 367.    [11] \"Sharp\" as they may be, they are softened, in some measure, by the      admission of my bitterest annotator, M. Crapelet, that \"I speak and      understand the French language well.\" vol. ii. p. 253. It is painful      and unusual with me to have recourse to such apparently      self-complimentary language; but when an adversary drives one into a      corner, and will not allow of fair space and fair play, one must fight      with feet as well as with hands ... \"manibus pedibusque\" ...    [12] This _hiatus_ must not be filled by the Author: ... \"haud equidem      tali me dignor honore.\"    [13] See vol. ii. p. 210-11.    [14] See vol. i. p. 186, vol. ii. pp. 49, 296, 392.

But the Reader will      be pleased to examine the _List of Plates prefixed_--in a preceding      page.    [15] Among these distinguished Literati, I here enrol with peculiar      satisfaction the names of the MARQUIS DE CHATEAUGIRON and Mons. DURAND      DE LANCON. No opportunity having occurred in the subsequent pages to      incorporate fac-similes of the Autographs of these distinguished      _Bibliophiles_, they are annexed in the present place.        [Autographs: M. de Chateaugiron, D. de Lancon]    [16] It is more than a negative consolation to me, to have lived to see the      day, that, although comparatively impoverished, _others_ have      been enriched by my labours. When I noticed a complete set of my      lucubrations on LARGE PAPER, valued at 250_l_. in a bookseller's      catalogue, (Mr. Pickering's) and afterwards learnt that this set had      found a PURCHASER, I had reason to think that I had \"deserved well\" of      the Literature of my country: and I resolved to live \"mihi carior\" in      consequence.

[Illustration]          LETTER I.      PASSAGE TO DIEPPE.    _Dieppe, April 20, 1818_.      At length then, my dear Friend, the long projected \"_Bibliographical,  Antiquarian_,[17] and _Picturesque Tour\"_ is carried into execution; and  the Tourist is safely landed on the shores of Normandy. \"Vous voila donc,  Monsieur a Dieppe!\"--exclaimed the landlord of the Grand Hotel  d'Angleterre--as I made my way through a vociferating crowd of old and  young, of both sexes, with cards of addresses in their hands; entreating me  to take up my abode at their respective hotels.... But I know your love of  method, and that you will be angry with me if I do not \"begin at the  beginning.\"    It was surely on one of the finest of all fine days that I left my home, on  the 14th of this present month, for the land of castles, churches, and  ancient chivalry. The wind from the south-east was blowing pretty smartly  at the time; but the sky was without a cloud, and I could not but look upon  the brilliancy of every external object as a favourable omen of the  progress and termination of my tour. Adverse winds, or the indolence or  unwillingness of the Captain, detained us at Brighton two whole  days--instead of sailing, as we were led to expect, on the day following  our arrival. We were to form the first ship's company which had visited  France this season. On approaching our gallant little bark, the  _Nancy_,[18] commanded by Captain BLABER, the anchor was weighed, and  hoisting sail, we stood out to sea. The day began to improve upon us. The  gloomy appearances of the morning gradually brightened up. A host of black  clouds rolled heavily away. The sun at length shone in his full meridian  splendour, and the ocean sparkled as we cut through its emerald waves. As I  supposed us to near the French coast, I strained my eyes to obtain an early  glimpse of something in the shape of cliff or jettie. But the wind  continued determinedly in the south east: the waves rose in larger masses;  and our little vessel threw up a heavy shower of foam as we entered on the  various tacks.    It is a grand sight--that vast, and apparently interminable ocean--      .... maria undique et undique coelum!    We darted from Beechy Head upon a long tack for the French coast: and as  the sun declined, we found it most prudent to put the Captain's advice, of  going below, into execution. Then commenced all the miseries of the voyage.  The moon had begun to assert her ascendancy, when, racked with torture and  pain in our respective berths, a tremendous surge washed completely over  the deck, sky-light, and binnacle: and down came, in consequence, drenched  with the briny wave, the hardiest of our crew, who, till then, had ventured  to linger upon deck. That crew was various; and not without a few of the  natives of those shores which we were about to visit.    To cut short my ship-narrative, suffice it only farther to say, that,  towards midnight, we heard our Captain exclaim that he saw \"the lights of  Dieppe\"--a joyful sound to us miserable wretches below. I well remember, at  this moment, looking up towards the deck with a cheerless eye, and  perceiving the light of the moon still lingering upon the main-sail,--but I  shall never forget how much more powerfully my sensations were excited,  when, as the dawn of day made objects visible, I looked up, and saw an old  wrinkle-visaged sailor, with a red night cap on begirt with large blue,  puckered, short petticoats--in possession of the helm--about to steer the  vessel into harbour![19]    About seven we were all upon deck. The sea was yet swoln and agitated, and  of a dingy colour: while        .... heavily with clouds came on the day,    as we slowly approached the outward harbour of DIEPPE. A grey morning with  drizzling rain, is not the best accompaniment of a first visit to a foreign  shore. Nevertheless every thing was new, and strange, and striking; and the  huge crucifix, to the right, did not fail to make a very forcible  impression. As we approached the, inner harbour, the shipping and the  buildings more distinctly presented themselves. The harbour is large, and  the vessels are entirely mercantile, with a plentiful sprinkling of fishing  smacks: but the manner in which the latter harmonized with the tint and  structure of the houses--the bustle upon shore--the casks, deal planks,  ropes, and goods of every description upon the quays,--all formed a most  animated and interesting scene. The population seemed countless, and  chiefly females; whose high caps and enormous ear-rings, with the rest of  their paraphernalia, half persuaded me that instead of being some few  twenty-five leagues only from our own white cliffs, I had in fact dropt  upon the Antipodes! What a scene (said I to my companion) for our CALCOTT  to depict![20] It was a full hour before we landed--saluted, and even  assailed on all sides, with entreaties to come to certain hotels. We were  not long however in fixing our residence at the _Hotel d'Angleterre_, of  which the worthy Mons. De La Rue[21] is the landlord.      [17] [Mons. Licquet, my translator, thinks, that in using the word      \"_Antiquaire_\"--as appears in the previous edition of this work,      incorporated in the gallicised sentence of \"_Voyage Bibliographique      Antiquaire_, &c.\"--I have committed an error; as the word      \"_Archeologique_\" ought, in his opinion, to have been adopted--and he      supposes that he best expresses my meaning by its adoption. Such a      correction may be better French; but \"Archaeological\" is not exactly      what is usually meant--in our language--by \"Antiquarian.\"]    [18] This smart little vessel,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16250"],[0,"Tristan and Isolda: Opera in Three Acts (#5)"],[1,"tell thee, truly;  what thou dost ask  remains for aye unanswered.--    (_He turns to_ ISOLDA, _who looks tenderly up at him_.)    Where Tristan now is going,  wilt thou, Isolda, follow?  The land that Tristan means  of sunlight has no gleams;  it is the dark  abode of night,  from whence I first  came forth to light,  and she who bore me  thence in anguish,  gave up her life,  nor long did languish.  She but looked on my face,  then sought this resting-place.  This land where Night doth reign,  where Tristan once hath lain--  now thither offers he  thy faithful guide to be.  So let Isolda  straight declare  if she will meet him there.    ISOLDA. When to a foreign land  before thou didst invite,  to thee, traitor,  resting true,  did Isolda follow.  Thy kingdom now art showing,  where surely we are going!  why should I shun that land  by which the world is spann'd?  For Tristan's house and home  Isold' will make her own.  The road whereby  we have to go  I pray thee quickly show!--    (TRISTAN _bends slowly over her and kisses her softly on the  forehead_. MELOT _starts furiously forward_.)    MELOT (_drawing his sword_). Thou villain! Ha!  Avenge thee, monarch!  Say, wilt suffer such scorn?    TRISTAN (_drawing his sword and turning quickly  round_)  Who's he will set his life against mine?    (_casting a look at MELOT_).    This was my friend;  he told me he loved me truly:  my fame and honor  he upheld more than all men.  With arrogance  he filled my heart,  and led on those  who prompted me  fame and pow'r to augment me  by wedding thee to our monarch.--  Thy glance, Isolda,  glamoured him thus;  and, jealous, my friend  played me false  to King Mark, whom I betrayed.--    (_He sets on_ MELOT.)    Guard thee, Melot!    [_As_ MELOT _presents his sword_ TRISTAN _drops his  own guard and sinks wounded into the arms of_ KURVENAL. ISOLDA  _throws herself upon his breast_. MARK _holds_ MELOT  _back. The curtain falls quickly_.]          ACT III.    _A Castle-Garden_.    [_At one side high castellated buildings, on the other a low  breastwork interrupted by a watch tower; at back the castle-gate. The  situation is supposed to be on rocky cliffs; through openings the  view extends over a wide sea horizon. The whole gives an impression  of being deserted by the owner, badly kept, and here and there  dilapidated and overgrown_.]      SCENE I.    [_In the foreground, in the garden, lies_ TRISTAN _sleeping  on a couch under the shade of a great lime-tree, stretched out as if  lifeless. At his head sits_ KURVENAL, _bending over him in grief  and anxiously listening to his breathing. From without comes the  mournful sound of a shepherd's pipe_.    _Presently the shepherd comes and looks in with interest, showing  the upper half of his body over the wall_.]    SHEPHERD. Kurvenal, ho!--  Say, Kurvenal,--  tell me, friend!  Does he still sleep?    KURVENAL (_turning a little towards him and shaking his head  sadly_). If he awoke  it would be  but for evermore to leave us,  unless we find  the lady-leech;  alone can she give help.--  See'st thou nought?  No ship yet on the sea?    SHEPHERD. Quite another ditty  then would I play  as merry as ever I may.  But tell me truly,  trusty friend,  why languishes our lord?    KURVENAL. Do not ask me;--  for I can give no answer.  Watch the sea,  if sails come in sight  a sprightly melody play.    SHEPHERD (_turns round and scans the horizon, shading his eyes with  his hand_).  Blank appears the sea!    (_He puts the reed pipe to his mouth and withdraws, playing_.)    TRISTAN (_motionless--faintly_).  The tune so well known--  why wake to that?    (_opens his eyes and slightly turns his head_).    Where am I?    KURVENAL (_starting in joyous surprise_).  Ha!--who is speaking?  It is his voice!--  Tristan! lov'd one!  My lord! my Tristan!    TRISTAN (_with effort_). Who--calls me?    KURVENAL. Life--at last--  O thanks be to heaven!--  sweetest life  unto my Tristan newly given!    TRISTAN (_faintly_). Kurvenal!--thou?  Where--was I?--  Where--am I?    KURVENAL. Where art thou?  In safety, tranquil and sure!  Kareol 'tis;  dost thou not know  thy fathers' halls?    TRISTAN. This my fathers'?    KURVENAL. Look but around.    TRISTAN. What awoke me?    KURVENAL. The herdsman's ditty  hast thou heard, doubtless;  he heedeth thy herds  above on the hills there.    TRISTAN. Have I herds, then?    KURVENAL. Sir, I say it!  Thine are court,  castle--all.  To thee yet true,  thy trusty folk,  as best they might,  have held thy home in guard:  the gift which once  thy goodness gave  to thy serfs and vassals here,  when going far away,  in foreign lands to dwell.    TRISTAN. What foreign land?    KURVENAL. Why! in Cornwall;  where cool and able,  all that was brilliant,  brave and noble,  Tristan, my lord, lightly took.    TRISTAN. Am I in Cornwall?    KURVENAL. No, no; in Kareol.    TRISTAN. How came I here?    KURVENAL. Hey now! how you came?  No horse hither you rode:  a vessel bore you across.  But on my shoulders  down to the ship  you had to ride: they are broad,  they carried you to the shore.  Now you are at home once more;  your own the land,  your native land;  all loved things now are near you,  unchanged the sun doth cheer you.  The wounds from which you languish  here all shall end their anguish.    (_He presses himself to_ TRISTAN'S _breast_.)    TRISTAN. Think'st thou thus!  I know 'tis not so,  but this I cannot tell thee.  Where I awoke  ne'er I was,  but where I wandered  I can indeed not tell thee.  The sun I could not see,  nor country fair, nor people;  but what I saw  I can indeed not tell thee.  It was--  the land from which I once came  and whither I return:  the endless realm  of earthly night.  One thing only  there possessed me:  blank, unending,  all-oblivion.--  How faded all forebodings!  O wistful goadings!--  Thus I call  the thoughts that all  t'ward light of day have press'd me.  What only yet doth rest me,  the love-pains that possess'd me,  from blissful death's affright  now drive me toward the light,  which, deceitful, bright and golden,  round thee, Isolda, shines.  Accursed day  with cruel glow!  Must thou ever  wake my woe?  Must thy light  be burning ever,  e'en by night  our hearts to sever?  Ah, my fairest,  sweetest, rarest!  When wilt thou--  when, ah, when--  let the torchlight dwindle,  that so my bliss may kindle?  The light, how long it glows!  When will the house repose?    (_His voice has grown fainter and he sinks back gently,  exhausted_.)    KURVENAL (_who has been deeply distressed, now quickly rousts  himself from his dejection_).  I once defied,  through faith in thee,  the one for whom  now with thee I'm yearning.  Trust in my words,  thou soon shalt see her  face to face.  My tongue that comfort giveth,--  if on the earth still she liveth.    TRISTAN (_very feebly_). Yet burns the beacon's spark:  yet is the house not dark,  Isolda lives and wakes:  her voice through darkness breaks.    KURVENAL. Lives she still,  then let new hope delight thee.  If foolish and dull you hold me,  this day you must not scold me.  As dead lay'st thou  since the day  when that accursed Melot  so foully wounded thee.  Thy wound was heavy:  how to heal it?  Thy simple servant  there bethought  that she who once  closed Morold's wound  with ease the hurt could heal thee  that Melot's sword did deal thee.  I found the best  of leeches there,  to Cornwall have I  sent for her:  a trusty serf  sails o'er the sea,  bringing Isold' to thee.    TRISTAN (_transported_). Isolda comes!  Isolda nears! (_He struggles for words_.)  O friendship! high  and holy friendship!    (_Draws_ KURVENAL _to him and embraces him_.)    O Kurvenal,  thou trusty heart,  my truest friend I rank thee!  Howe'er can Tristan thank thee?  My shelter and shield  in fight and strife;  in weal or woe  thou'rt mine for life.  Those whom I hate  thou hatest too;  those whom I love  thou lovest too.  When good King Mark  I followed of old,  thou wert to him truer than gold.  When I was false  to my noble friend,  to betray too thou didst descend.  Thou art selfless,  solely mine;  thou feel'st for me  when I suffer.  But--what I suffer,  thou canst not feel for me!  this terrible yearning in my heart,  this feverish burning's  cruel smart,--  did I but show it,  couldst thou but know it,  no time here wouldst thou tarry,  to watch from tow'r thou wouldst hurry;  with all devotion  viewing the ocean,  with eyes impatiently spying,  there, where her ship's sails are flying.  Before the wind she  drives to find me;  on the wings of love she neareth,--  Isolda hither steereth!--  she nears, she nears,  so boldly and fast!  It waves, it waves,  the flag from the mast!  Hurra! Hurra!  she reaches the bar!  Dost thou not see?  Kurvenal, dost thou not see?    (_As_ KURNEVAL _hesitates to leave_ TRISTAN, _who is  gazing at him in mute expectation, the mournful tune of the shepherd  is heard, as before_.)    KURVENAL (_dejectedly_). Still is no ship in sight.    TRISTAN (_has listened with waning excitement and now  recommences with growing melancholy_).  Is this the meaning then,  thou old pathetic ditty,  of all thy sighing sound?--  On evening's breeze  it sadly rang  when, as a child,  my father's death-news chill'd me;  through morning's mist  it stole more sadly,  when the son  his mother's fate was taught,  when they who gave me breath  both felt the hand of death  to them came also  through their pain  the ancient ditty's  yearning strain,  which asked me once  and asks me now  which was the fate before me  to which my mother bore me?--  What was the fate?--  The strain so plaintive  now repeats it:--  for yearning--and dying!    (_He falls back senseless_.)    KURVENAL (_who has been vainly striving to calm_ TRISTAN, _cries  out in terror_).  My master! Tristan!--  Frightful enchantment!--  O love's deceit!  O passion's pow'r!  Most sweet dream 'neath the sun,  see the work thou hast done!--"]]]
