But this was not  the worst. My master's son was in the habit of stealing the rice and rum.  Ben had seen him do this, and thought he might do the same, and when  master found out that Ben had stolen the rice and swore to punish him, he  tried to excuse himself by saying that Master Dickey did the same thing  every night. The lad denied it to his father, and was so angry with Ben  for informing against him, that out of revenge he ran and got a bayonet,  and whilst the poor wretch was suspended by his hands and writhing under  his wounds, he run it quite through his foot. I was not by when he did it,  but I saw the wound when I came home, and heard Ben tell the manner in  which it was done.    I must say something more about this cruel son of a cruel father.--He had  no heart--no fear of God; he had been brought up by a bad father in a bad  path, and he delighted to follow in the same steps. There was a little old  woman among the slaves called Sarah, who was nearly past work; and, Master  Dickey being the overseer of the slaves just then, this poor creature, who  was subject to several bodily infirmities, and was not quite right in her  head, did not wheel the barrow fast enough to please him. He threw her  down on the ground, and after beating her severely, he took her up in his  arms and flung her among the prickly-pear bushes, which are all covered  over with sharp venomous prickles. By this her naked flesh was so  grievously wounded, that her body swelled and festered all over, and she  died a few days after. In telling my own sorrows, I cannot pass by those  of my fellow-slaves--for when I think of my own griefs, I remember theirs.    I think it was about ten years I had worked in the salt ponds at Turk's  Island, when my master left off business, and retired to a house he had in  Bermuda, leaving his son to succeed him in the island. He took me with him  to wait upon his daughters; and I was joyful, for I was sick, sick of  Turk's Island, and my heart yearned to see my native place again, my  mother, and my kindred.    I had seen my poor mother during the time I was a slave in Turk's Island.  One Sunday morning I was on the beach with some of the slaves, and we saw  a sloop come in loaded with slaves to work in the salt water. We got a  boat and went aboard. When I came upon the deck I asked the black people,  \"Is there any one here for me?\" \"Yes,\" they said, \"your mother.\" I thought  they said this in jest--I could scarcely believe them for joy; but when I  saw my poor mammy my joy was turned to sorrow, for she had gone from her  senses. \"Mammy,\" I said, \"is this you?\" She did not know me. \"Mammy,\" I  said, \"what's the matter?\" She began to talk foolishly, and said that she  had been under the vessel's bottom. They had been overtaken by a violent  storm at sea. My poor mother had never been on the sea before, and she was  so ill, that she lost her senses, and it was long before she came quite to  herself again. She had a sweet child with her--a little sister I had never  seen, about four years of age, called Rebecca. I took her on shore with  me, for I felt I should love her directly; and I kept her with me a week.  Poor little thing! her's has been a sad life, and continues so to this  day. My mother worked for some years on the island, but was taken back to  Bermuda some time before my master carried me again thither.[7]    [Footnote 7: Of the subsequent lot of her relatives she can tell but  little. She says, her father died while she and her mother were at Turk's  Island; and that he had been long dead and buried before any of his  children in Bermuda knew of it, they being slaves on other estates. Her  mother died after Mary went to Antigua. Of the fate of the rest of her  kindred, seven brothers and three sisters, she knows nothing further than  this--that the eldest sister, who had several children to her master, was  taken by him to Trinidad; and that the youngest, Rebecca, is still alive,  and in slavery in Bermuda. Mary herself is now about forty-three years of  age.--_Ed._]    After I left Turk's Island, I was told by some negroes that came over from  it, that the poor slaves had built up a place with boughs and leaves,  where they might meet for prayers, but the white people pulled it down  twice, and would not allow them even a shed for prayers. A flood came down  soon after and washed away many houses, filled the place with sand, and  overflowed the ponds: and I do think that this was for their wickedness;  for the Buckra men[8] there were very wicked. I saw and heard much that  was very very bad at that place.    [Footnote 8: Negro term for white people.]    I was several years the slave of Mr. D---- after I returned to my native  place. Here I worked in the grounds. My work was planting and hoeing  sweet-potatoes, Indian corn, plantains, bananas, cabbages, pumpkins,  onions, &c. I did all the household work, and attended upon a horse and  cow besides,--going also upon all errands. I had to curry the horse--to  clean and feed him--and sometimes to ride him a little. I had more than  enough to do--but still it was not so very bad as Turk's Island.    My old master often got drunk, and then he would get in a fury with his  daughter, and beat her till she was not fit to be seen. I remember on one  occasion, I had gone to fetch water, and when I Was coming up the hill I  heard a great screaming; I ran as fast as I could to the house, put down  the water, and went into the chamber, where I found my master beating Miss  D---- dreadfully. I strove with all my strength to get her away from him;  for she was all black and blue with bruises. He had beat her with his  fist, and almost killed her. The people gave me credit for getting her  away. He turned round and began to lick me. Then I said, \"Sir, this is not  Turk's Island.\" I can't repeat his answer, the words were too wicked--too  bad to say. He wanted to treat me the same in Bermuda as he had done in  Turk's Island.    He had an ugly fashion of stripping himself quite naked, and ordering me  then to wash him in a tub of water. This was worse to me than all the  licks. Sometimes when he called me to wash him I would not come, my eyes  were so full of shame. He would then come to beat me. One time I had  plates and knives in my hand, and I dropped both plates and knives, and  some of the plates were broken. He struck me so severely for this, that at  last I defended myself, for I thought it was high time to do so. I then  told him I would not live longer with him, for he was a very indecent  man--very spiteful, and too indecent; with no shame for his servants, no  shame for his own flesh. So I went away to a neighbouring house and sat  down and cried till the next morning, when I went home again, not knowing  what else to do.    After that I was hired to work at Cedar Hills, and every Saturday night I  paid the money to my master. I had plenty of work to do there--plenty of  washing; but yet I made myself pretty comfortable. I earned two dollars  and a quarter a week, which is twenty pence a day.    During the time I worked there, I heard that Mr. John Wood was going to  Antigua. I felt a great wish to go there, and I went to Mr. D----, and  asked him to let me go in Mr. Wood's service. Mr. Wood did not then want  to purchase me; it was my own fault that I came under him, I was so  anxious to go. It was ordained to be, I suppose; God led me there. The  truth is, I did not wish to be any longer the slave of my indecent master.    Mr. Wood took me with him to Antigua, to the town of St. John's, where he  lived. This was about fifteen years ago. He did not then know whether I  was to be sold; but Mrs. Wood found that I could work, and she wanted to  buy me. Her husband then wrote to my master to inquire whether I was to be  sold? Mr. D---- wrote in reply, \"that I should not be sold to any one that  would treat me ill.\" It was strange he should say this, when he had  treated me so ill himself. So I was purchased by Mr. Wood for 300 dollars,  (or L100 Bermuda currency.)[9]    [Footnote 9: About L67. 10s. sterling.]    My work there was to attend the chambers and nurse the child, and to go  down to the pond and wash clothes. But I soon fell ill of the rheumatism,  and grew so very lame that I was forced to walk with a stick. I got the  Saint Anthony's fire, also, in my left leg, and became quite a cripple. No  one cared much to come near me, and I was ill a long long time; for  several months I could not lift the limb. I had to lie in a little old  out-house, that was swarming with bugs and other vermin, which tormented  me greatly; but I had no other place to lie in. I got the rheumatism by  catching cold at the pond side, from washing in the fresh water; in the  salt water I never got cold. The person who lived in next yard, (a Mrs.  Greene,) could not bear to hear my cries and groans. She was kind, and  used to send an old slave woman to help me, who sometimes brought me a  little soup. When the doctor found I was so ill, he said I must be put  into a bath of hot water. The old slave got the bark of some bush that was  good for the pains, which she boiled in the hot water, and every night she  came and put me into the bath, and did what she could for me: I don't know  what I should have done, or what would have become of me, had it not been  for her.--My mistress, it is true, did send me a little food; but no one  from our family came near me but the cook, who used to shove my food in at  the door, and say, \"Molly, Molly, there's your dinner.\" My mistress did not  care to take any trouble about me; and if the Lord had not put it into the  hearts of the neighbours to be kind to me, I must, I really think, have  lain and died.    It was a long time before I got well enough to work in the house. Mrs.  Wood, in the meanwhile, hired a mulatto woman to nurse the child; but she  was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17855"],[0,"Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material (#5)"],[1,"qualities and  characteristics of the stock and to get the machinery equipment adjusted  properly. The yield of fiber was not determined in this preliminary  test, since the knowledge of it was not essential at this stage of the  work. The cooked stock which was emptied into the drainer to be washed  free from black liquor was composed largely of whole pieces of hurds,  but only slight pressure between the fingers was required to crush the  pieces. In the case of wood, this condition ordinarily would indicate  undercooking, but might not in the case of hurds. Further observation on  the action of the cooked stock during subsequent processes was necessary  in order to judge of its quality or the suitability of the cooking  conditions. The total cooked stock, about 500 pounds, was divided into  two portions of 200 and 300 pounds, respectively, and work was continued  on them separately. The 200-pound test, designated as run No. 135, was  put into a 350-pound washing engine, washed one hour, and given a total  light brush of 2-1/4 hours. The washing removed a great amount of dirt,  but the engine did not reduce the hurd stock as much as was desired.  After heating the stock in the beater to 40 deg. C., it was bleached with  bleaching-powder solution, 94 gallons at 0.418 pound bleach per gallon,  equivalent to 19.7 per cent of the fiber. This percentage of bleach is  regarded as too high for stock intended for book-paper manufacture, and  subsequent cooks therefore were given harder treatment in order to  reduce this figure. After draining and washing free from bleach  residues, the stock was furnished in the beater with 13 per cent of  clay, 1 per cent of resin size, and 2.5 per cent of alum, was tinted  blue, given one hour's light brush, and pumped to the stock chest. When  running it on the paper machine, the Jordan refiner seemed to have  little effect in reducing shives of undertreated wood, which indicated  further the necessity of harder cooking. The furnish acted well on the  paper machine at 70 feet per minute, but appeared somewhat too \"free\" on  the wire. The paper produced from this test is of very low quality, due  to the improper preparation of the stock, lack of sufficient bleach, the  use of too small an amount of blue tinting, and the presence of an  excessive amount of dirt, sand, and shives. The excessive amount of dirt  and sand suggested the sieving of the hurds before cooking, and this was  performed in all subsequent cooks.    The finish of the sheet is very poor, due to the fact that the calender  stack was composed of very light rolls which did not have a satisfactory  surface, yet the stack is known to be able to produce better finishes if  the proper stock is employed.    Run No. 136 was made on the 300-pound portion of stock from cooks Nos.  293, 294, 295, and 296, and in essentially the same manner as run No.  135. The stock was washed one hour, but given a brush of three hours,  and this brush was harder than in run No. 135. Bleach to the extent of  19.8 per cent of the fiber was used, assisted by 1 pint of oil of  vitriol, and the resulting color was an improvement over that of run No.  135. After adding 13.5 per cent of clay and sizing with 1.1 per cent of  resin size, the furnish was given one-half hour's light brush, tinted,  and run on the machine, which was set at 70 feet per minute. This stock  acted better on the wire and gave no trouble on the machine, but it  still seemed to be impossible to reduce the wood shives by manipulation  of the Jordan refiner. The resulting sheet is an improvement over that  produced by No. 135, but is far from satisfactory.    Run No. 138 was made from hurds which, as in all subsequent tests, were  sieved on a 11-1/2-mesh wire screen until practically all the loose dirt  and sand was removed, which operation caused a loss averaging 3 per cent  of the hurds. Stock from cooks Nos. 302 and 303 was used for this run  and the increased amount of caustic soda and the increase in the time of  cooking gave a stock of better appearance than those of preceding tests.    The stock, amounting to 231 pounds dry weight, was washed and at the  same time given a light brush for one hour only, after which it was  bleached with 17 per cent of bleach without the addition of acid. Since  the preceding paper appeared somewhat weak and had a low tearing  quality, it was decided to use a furnish of 15.7 per cent bleached  sulphite and 84.3 per cent bleached hemp-hurd stock. After loading with  13.1 per cent of clay and sizing with 1.1 per cent of resin size, the  furnish was given a medium brush for one hour, tinted, and run on to the  machine at 70 feet per minute. The stock gave no trouble on the machine,  but it was impossible to judge the effect of the Jordan refiner, because  through an oversight the machine chest had not been cleaned since  previous use on an unbleached yucca material. It is believed, however,  that sheet No. 138 shows improvement in the preparation of the hurd  pulp.    Run No. 139 was made from stock of cooks Nos. 304 and 305, in which  still more caustic soda was employed and the time and temperature of  cooking were increased, giving a yield of total fiber of 40.7 per cent  of the sieved or 39.4 per cent of the unsieved hurds. The cooked stock  still seemed to be undertreated, but it must be remembered that in  working with any new raw material it is impossible to know in advance  how the properly treated material should appear. A washing of one hour  was given while the roll was lowered from a light to a medium brush,  after which the stock was bleached with 17.1 per cent of bleach without  the aid of acid. Since sulphite stock improved the previous paper, this  bleached stock was used in a furnish of 16.6 per cent sulphite and 83.4  per cent hurds, loaded with 16.7 per cent clay, sized with 1.4 per cent  resin size, given a medium brush of two hours, tinted, and run on to the  machine at 70 feet per minute. The Jordan refiner seemed to have little  effect in reducing shives and was therefore left \"just off.\" No trouble  was experienced with the stock on the machine, and the sheet is an  improvement over previous samples.    Run No. 140 was made from cooks Nos. 306 and 307, in which more caustic  soda was employed than in any previous cooks and at a higher  concentration, the fiber yields of which averaged 37.3 per cent of the  unsieved hurds. Not much improvement was apparent in the cooked stock,  in spite of the increased severity of cooking. The stock was washed and  given a medium brush for one hour, bleached with 11.9 per cent of  bleach, assisted with one-half pint of oil of vitriol, and made into a  furnish of 14.9 per cent sulphite and 85.1 per cent of the hurd stock.  After loading with 14.7 per cent of clay and sizing with 1.28 per cent  of resin size, the furnish was given two hours' medium brush, tinted,  and run on to the paper machine at 70 feet per minute. Again the Jordan  refiner did not seem to reduce the wood shives sufficiently, and it was  left \"just off.\" No trouble which could be attributed to the stock was  experienced on the paper machine. The color of the resulting paper is  due to the use of too little blue in tinting and probably in some  measure to the use of too low a percentage of bleach.    Run No. 141 was made from the stock of cooks Nos. 308 and 309 in  practically the same manner as run No. 140. The stock was washed and  brushed one hour, bleached (the record of the amount of bleach was  lost), made into a furnish of 14.7 per cent of sulphite and 85.3 per  cent of hurd stock, loaded with 14.9 per cent of clay, sized with 1.26  per cent of resin size, given one hour at a medium brush, tinted, and  run on to the machine. The Jordan refiner was able to reduce the wood  shives to a somewhat greater degree than in previous runs and was held  at a medium brush. The stock acted well on the machine and produced a  sheet of better quality than any preceding, with the exception of the  color, which was due to using too small a quantity of blue.    Among the cooks made for run No. 142 are Nos. 312 and 313, in which the  concentration of the caustic soda was raised to 113 and 116 grams per  liter and the percentage employed was also increased. In spite of these  increases the stock from these two cooks did not show any appreciable  improvement when dumped from the rotary. Stock from cooks Nos. 310, 311,  and 312 was given a medium brush and washing of one hour, bleached with  10.95 per cent of bleach, made into a furnish consisting of 15.2 per  cent of sulphite and 84.8 per cent of hurd stock, loaded with 15.2 per  cent of clay, sized with 1.28 per cent of resin size, given a medium  brush for one hour, tinted, and pumped to the stock chest. Stock from  cooks Nos. 313 and 314 was treated in exactly the same manner, except  that 11.4 per cent of bleach was used. It was pumped to the stock chest  and mixed with the furnished stock from cooks Nos. 310, 311, and 312. A  medium Jordan brush was given the stock and it acted well on the paper  machine, which was speeded to 75 feet per minute. There seems to be a  tendency in the hurd stock to crush a little at the \"dandy roll,\" and  although the marks are not removed by the calender stack which was  employed in those tests it was found that one \"nip\" on the  supercalenders renders them practically imperceptible and it is believed  that the proper size and weight of calender stack would entirely remove  these marks. All of the papers produced up to this point are somewhat  lacking in the bulk desired in a book paper; therefore, in the two  following runs soda-poplar stock was included in the furnishes.    In run No. 143 stock from cooks Nos. 315 and 316 was given a medium  brush and washing for one hour and was medium brushed for one hour more,  bleached with 11.3 per cent of bleach assisted with one-half pint of oil  of vitriol, made into a furnish of 16.5 per cent of"]]]
