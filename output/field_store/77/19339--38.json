Great Britain and France replied with       the announcement that the operations of blockade would not be       conducted \"outside of European waters, including the       Mediterranean.\"         The definition of a \"radius of activity\" for the allied fleet       in European waters, including the Mediterranean, is the first       intimation of the geographical limits of the reprisal order.       Its limits were not given more exactly, the Allies contend,       because Germany was equally indefinite in proclaiming all the       waters surrounding Great Britain and Ireland a \"war zone.\" The       measures adopted are those of a blockade against all trade to       and from Germany--not the historical kind of blockade       recognized in international law, but a new and original form.         The several notes between the United States and the       belligerent Governments follow. The stars in the German note       mean that as it came to the State Department in cipher certain       words were omitted, probably through telegraphic error. In the       official text of the note the State Department calls       attention to the stars by an asterisk and a footnote saying       \"apparent omission.\" In the French note the same thing occurs,       and is indicated by the footnote \"undecipherable group,\"       meaning that the cipher symbols into which the French note was       put by our Embassy in Paris could not be translated back into       plain language by the State Department cipher experts. From       the context it is apparent that the omitted words in the       German note are \"insist upon,\" or words to that effect.    AMERICAN NOTE TO THE BELLIGERENTS.    _The following identic note was sent by the Secretary of State to the  American Ambassadors at London and Berlin:_    WASHINGTON, Feb. 20, 1915.    You will please deliver to Sir Edward Grey the following identic note,  which we are sending England and Germany:    In view of the correspondence which has passed between this Government  and Great Britain and Germany, respectively, relative to the declaration  of a war zone by the German Admiralty, and the use of neutral flags by  the British merchant vessels, this Government ventures to express the  hope that the two belligerent Governments may, through reciprocal  concessions, find a basis for agreement which will relieve neutral ships  engaged in peaceful commerce from the great dangers which they will  incur in the high seas adjacent to the coasts of the belligerents.    The Government of the United States respectfully suggests that an  agreement in terms like the following might be entered into. This  suggestion is not to be regarded as in any sense a proposal made by this  Government, for it of course fully recognizes that it is not its  privilege to propose terms of agreement between Great Britain and  Germany, even though the matter be one in which it and the people of the  United States are directly and deeply interested. It is merely venturing  to take the liberty, which it hopes may be accorded a sincere friend  desirous of embarrassing neither nation involved, and of serving, if it  may, the common interests of humanity. The course outlined is offered in  the hope that it may draw forth the views and elicit the suggestions of  the British and German Governments on a matter of capital interest to  the whole world.    Germany and Great Britain to agree:    First--That neither will sow any floating mines, whether upon the high  seas or in territorial waters; that neither will plant on the high seas  anchored mines, except within cannon range of harbors for defensive  purposes only; and that all mines shall bear the stamp of the Government  planting them, and be so constructed as to become harmless if separated  from their moorings.    Second--That neither will use submarines to attack merchant vessels of  any nationality, except to enforce the right of visit and search.    Third---That each will require their respective merchant vessels not to  use neutral flags for the purpose of disguise or ruse de guerre.    Germany to agree: That all importations of food or foodstuffs from the  United States (and from such other neutral countries as may ask it) into  Germany shall be consigned to agencies to be designated by the United  States Government; that these American agencies shall have entire charge  and control without interference on the part of German Government of the  receipt and distribution of such importations, and shall distribute them  solely to retail dealers bearing licenses from the German Government  entitling them to receive and furnish such food and foodstuffs to  non-combatants only; that any violation of the terms of the retailers'  licenses shall work a forfeiture of their rights to receive such food  and foodstuffs for this purpose, and that such food and foodstuffs will  not be requisitioned by the German Government for any purpose  whatsoever, or be diverted to the use of the armed forces of Germany.    Great Britain to agree: That food and foodstuffs will not be placed  upon the absolute contraband list, and that shipments of such  commodities will not be interfered with or detained by British  authorities, if consigned to agencies designated by the United States  Government in Germany for the receipt and distribution of such cargoes  to licensed German retailers for distribution solely to the  non-combatant population.    In submitting this proposed basis of agreement this Government does not  wish to be understood as admitting or denying any belligerent or neutral  right established by the principles of international law, but would  consider the agreement, if acceptable to the interested powers, a modus  vivendi based upon expediency rather than legal right, and as not  binding upon the United States either in its present form or in a  modified form until accepted by this Government.    BRYAN.      II.    GERMANY'S REPLY.    _The German reply, handed to the American Ambassador at Berlin,  follows:_    BERLIN, March 1, 1915.    The undersigned has the honor to inform his Excellency, Mr. James W.  Gerard, Ambassador of the United States of America, in reply to the note  of the 22d inst., that the Imperial German Government have taken note  with great interest of the suggestion of the American Government that  certain principles for the conduct of maritime war on the part of  Germany and England be agreed upon for the protection of neutral  shipping. They see therein new evidence of the friendly feelings of the  American Government toward the German Government, which are fully  reciprocated by Germany.    It is in accordance with Germany's wishes also to have maritime war  conducted according to rules, which, without discriminatingly  restricting one or the other of the belligerent powers in the use of  their means of warfare, are equally considerate of the interests of  neutrals and the dictates of humanity. Consequently it was intimated in  the German note of the 16th inst. that observation of the Declaration  of London on the part of Germany's adversaries would create a new  situation from which the German Government would gladly draw the proper  conclusions.    Proceeding from this view, the German Government have carefully examined  the suggestion of the American Government and believe that they can  actually see in it a suitable basis for the practical solution of the  questions which have arisen.    With regard to the various points of the American note, they beg to make  the following remarks:    First--With regard to the sowing of mines, the German Government would  be willing to agree, as suggested, not to use floating mines and to have  anchored mines constructed as indicated. Moreover, they agree to put the  stamp of the Government on all mines to be planted. On the other hand,  it does not appear to them to be feasible for the belligerents wholly to  for ego the use of anchored mines for offensive purposes.    Second--The German Government would undertake not to use their  submarines to attack mercantile of any flag except when necessary to  enforce the right of visit and search. Should the enemy nationality of  the vessel or the presence of contraband be ascertained, submarines  would proceed in accordance with the general rules of international law.    Third--As provided in the American note, this restriction of the use of  the submarines is contingent on the fact that enemy mercantile abstain  from the use of the neutral flag and other neutral distinctive marks. It  would appear to be a matter of course that such mercantile vessels also  abstain from arming themselves and from all resistance by force, since  such procedure contrary to international law would render impossible any  action of the submarines in accordance with international law.    Fourth--The regulation of legitimate importations of food into Germany  suggested by the American Government appears to be in general  acceptable. Such regulation would, of course, be confined to  importations by sea, but that would, on the other hand, include  indirect importations by way of neutral ports. The German Government  would, therefore, be willing to make the declarations of the nature  provided in the American note so that the use of the imported food and  foodstuffs solely by the non-combatant population would be guaranteed.  The Imperial Government must, however, in addition (* * * * *)[1] having  the importation of other raw material used by the economic system of  non-combatants, including forage, permitted. To that end the enemy  Governments would have to permit the free entry into Germany of the raw  material mentioned in the free list of the Declaration of London, and to  treat materials included in the list of conditional contraband according  to the same principles as food and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15479"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 2, May, 1915 (#5)"],[1,"begin to see  that the case is hopeless.\" But we must not deceive ourselves, for even  when her allies are defeated Prussia will still be hard to beat.  Przemysl must not cause us to slacken our effort in any direction or in  the slightest degree.      WHAT THE RUSSIANS FOUND    Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.    _LONDON, April 3.--The London Times under date Przemysl, March 30,  publishes a dispatch from Stanley Washburn, its special correspondent  with the Russian armies, who, by courtesy of the Russian high command,  is the first foreigner to visit the great Galician fortress since its  fall. He says:_    Przemysl is a story of an impregnable fortress two or three times  over-garrisoned with patient, haggard soldiers starving in trenches, and  sleek, faultlessly dressed officers living off the fat of the land in  fashionable hotels and restaurants.    The siege started with a total population within the lines of investment  of approximately 200,000. Experts estimate that the fortress could have  been held with 50,000 or 60,000 men against any forces the Russians  could bring against it. It is probable that such supplies as there were  were uneconomically expended, with the result that when the push came  the situation was at once acute, and the suffering of all classes save  the officers became general. First the cavalry and transport horses were  consumed. Then everything available. Cats were sold at 8 shillings, and  fair-sized dogs at a sovereign.    While the garrison became thin and half starved, the mode of life of the  officers in the town remained unchanged. The Cafe Sieber was constantly  well filled with dilettante officers who gossipped and played cards and  billiards and led the life to which they were accustomed in Vienna.  Apparently very few shared any of the hardships of their men or made any  effort to relieve their condition. At the Hotel Royal until the last,  the officers had their three meals a day, with fresh meat, cigars,  cigarettes, wines, and every luxury, while, as a witness has informed  me, their own orderlies and servants begged for a slice of bread.    There can be no question that ultimate surrender was due to the fact  that the garrison was on the verge of starvation, while the officers'  diet was merely threatened with curtailment. Witnesses state that  private soldiers were seen actually to fall in the streets from lack of  nourishment. The officers are reported to have retained their private  thoroughbred riding horses until the day before the surrender, when  2,000 of them were killed to prevent them from falling into the hands of  the Russians. A Russian officer of high rank informed me that when he  entered the town hundreds of these bodies of beautiful thoroughbred  horses were to be seen with half-crazed Austrian and Hungarian soldiers  tearing into the bodies with their faces and hands smeared with red  blood as they devoured the raw flesh.    [Illustration: Map showing the scene of action between Przemysl and  Cracow and the Carpathian Passes.]    The Russians were utterly amazed at the casual reception which they  received. The Austrian officers showed not the slightest sign of being  disconcerted or humiliated at the collapse of their fortress.    The first Russian effort was at once to relieve the condition of the  garrison and civilians. Owing to the destruction of the bridge this was  delayed, but soon with remarkable efficiency distribution depots were  opened everywhere and the most pressing needs were somewhat relieved.    The entire conduct of the siege on the part of the garrison seems wholly  without explanation. The Austrians had throughout plenty of ammunition,  and they certainly grossly outnumbered the Russians; yet they made but  one recent effort to break out, which occurred three days before the  surrender.    Civilians inform me that they gladly welcome the Russians and that the  first troops who entered were greeted with cheers, while the garrison  was frankly pleased that the siege was over and their troubles at an  end.    As an example of overofficering it may be stated that General Kusmanek  had seventy-five officers on his staff, while General Artamonov, the  acting Russian Governor, had but four on his immediate staff.    The removal of the prisoners is proceeding with great efficiency. They  are going out at the rate of about 10,000 a day. The docility of the  captives is indicated by the fact that the Russian guards attached to  the prisoners' columns number about one for every hundred prisoners.  They are all strung out for miles between the fortress and Lemberg. The  prisoners are so eager to get out and to see the last of the war that  they follow the instructions of their captors like children.    All the civilians as well as prisoners I have talked with are unanimous  in their praise of the Russian officers and soldiers, who have shown  nothing but kindness and delicacy of feeling since their entrance into  the fortress. This consideration strikes me as being utterly wasted on  the captured officers, who treat the situation superciliously and are  quite complacent in their relations with the Russians.          THE JESTERS.    By MARION COUTHOUY SMITH.          Ev'n he, the master of the songs of life,        May speak at times with less than certain sound--        \"He jests at scars who never felt a wound.\"      So runs his word! Yet on the verge of strife,      They jest not who have never known the knife;        They tremble who in the waiting ranks are found,        While those scarred deep on many a battle-ground      Sing to the throbbing of the drum and fife.      They laugh who know the open, fearless breast,        The thrust, the steel-point, and the spreading stain;      Whose flesh is hardened to the searing test,        Whose souls are tempered to a high disdain.      Theirs is the lifted brow, the gallant jest,        The long last breath, that holds a victor-strain.

London is in the exact center of the  map._    If the German Army were in Manchester.    If the German Army were in Manchester, every fit man in the country  would enlist without a moment's delay.    Do you realise that the German Army is now at Ostend, only 125 miles  away--or 40 miles nearer to London than is Manchester?    How much nearer must the Germans come before _you_ do something to stop  them?    The German Army must be beaten in Belgium. The time to do it is _now_.    Will you help? Yes? Then enlist _TODAY_.    _God Save the King._    (Facsimile of an advertisement that appeared in The London Times, March  17, 1915.)]          Battle of the Dardanelles    The Disaster That Befell the Allies' Fleet      AS THE TURKS SAW IT.    _BERLIN, March 22, (via London, 11:33 A.M.)--The correspondent at  Constantinople of the Wolff Bureau telegraphed today a description of  the fighting at the Dardanelles on Thursday, March 18, in which the  French battleship Bouvet and two British battleships were sent to the  bottom. An abridgment of the correspondent's story follows:_    The efforts of the Allies to force the Strait of the Dardanelles reached  their climax in an artillery duel on Thursday, March 18, which lasted  seven hours. The entire atmosphere around the Turkish forts was darkened  by clouds of smoke from exploding shells and quantities of earth thrown  into the air by the projectiles of the French and British warships. The  earth trembled for miles around.    The Allies entered the strait at 11:30 in the morning, and shelled the  town of Chank Kale. Four French and five British warships took part in  the beginning. This engagement reached its climax at 1:30, when the fire  of the Allies was concentrated upon Fort Hamidieh and the adjacent  fortified positions.    The attack of modern marine artillery upon strong land forts presented  an interesting as well as a terrifying spectacle. At times the forts  were completely enveloped in smoke. At 2 o'clock the Allies changed  their tactics and concentrated their fire upon individual batteries, but  it was evident that they found difficulty in getting the range. Many of  the shells fell short, casting up pillars of water, or went over the  forts to explode in the town.    At 3:15, when the bombardment was at its hottest, the French battleship  Bouvet was seen to be sinking at the stern. A moment later her bows  swung clear of the water, and she was seen going down. Cheers from the  Turkish garrisons and forts greeted this sight. Torpedo boats and other  craft of the Allies hurried to the rescue, but they were successful in  saving only a few men. Besides having been struck by a mine, the Bouvet  was severely damaged above the water line by shell fire. One projectile  struck her forward deck. A mast also was shot away and hung overboard.  It could be seen that the Bouvet when she sank was endeavoring to gain  the mouth of the strait. This, however, was difficult, owing,  apparently, to the fact that her machinery had been damaged.    Shortly after the sinking of the Bouvet a British ship was struck on the  deck squarely amidship and compelled to withdraw from the fight. Then  another British vessel was badly damaged, and at 3:45 was seen to retire  under a terrific fire from the Turkish battery. This vessel ran in  toward the shore. For a full hour the Allies tried to protect her with  their guns, but it was apparent that she was destined for destruction.  Eight effective hits showed the hopelessness of the situation for this  vessel. She then withdrew toward the mouth of the Dardanelles, which she  reached in a few minutes under a hail of shells. The forts continued  firing until the Allies were out of range.    This was the first day when the warships attacking the Dardanelles kept  within range of the Turkish guns for any considerable"]]]
