All of his ten legs were broken, and of course he couldn't get  away, so we went down, got a long cross-cut saw, and sawed off his  head. Now, if you don't believe that story, you come to our house  sometime and I'll show you the cross-cut saw.\"    Hans stared in breathless amazement. His solemn face was too much for  the others, and a peal of laughter rang through the car. At this Hans  grew suspicious, and at length a sickly grin overspread his features.    \"I know you, Tom Rofer,\" he said. \"Dot vos von of dem fish stories,  ain't it alretty?\"    \"No, it's a jibberjacker story, Hans.\"    \"It vos a jibjacker fish story den annahow. You can't fool me some  more. I vos too schmart for dot alretty. Ven I go py der academy I git  mine ear teeths cut, hey?\"    \"All right, Hans, if you have cut your ear-teeth we'll call it off,\"  said Dick, and here the conversation took a more rational turn.    \"So far as I know only a few of the fellows have left the Hall on  account of the scarlet fever scare,\" said Larry. \"And they were boys  that nobody seemed to care much about.\"    \"I was told that the fellows expected to elect an entirely new lot of  officers,\" said Sam. \"We have been away so much I've rather lost track  of our military affairs.\"    \"Captain Putnam said we would have to ballot for officers as soon as  all the boys were back,\" said Larry. \"Some of the old officers have  graduated, you must remember.\"    \"I've not forgotten that I was once second lieutenant of Company A,\"  put in Dick. \"Reckon I'll have to try my luck once more--if the boys  want me to run.\"    \"Well, I want you to run for one, Dick,\" said Larry. \"Hans, you'll vote  for Dick, won't you?\"    \"Yah, und I vonts him to vote for me, too,\" said the German youth.    \"Why, Hans, do you want to be water-carrier this year?\" asked Sam.    \"_Nein_, I vonts to be high brivate py der rear rank alretty. Von of der  fellows tole me dot would chust suit me.\"    \"All right, Hans, we'll all elect you high private of the rear rank,\"  answered Larry with a laugh.          CHAPTER VI    FUN ON THE BOAT      At the city of Ithaca the boys stopped long enough to get dinner, and  were here joined by Fred Garrison and George Granbury, two more of  their old school chums.    \"Hurrah for the gathering of the clans!\" cried George Granbury, with a  beaming face. \"This is like a touch of old times. How are all of you,  anyway?\"    \"First rate, with the exception of Hans here,\" said Tom. \"He's got the  buckwheat measles.\"    \"Yah, und Tom he's got der jipperjocker fefer,\" declared the German  boy, bound to do his best to get square.    \"Good for Hans!\" cried Sam. \"Tom, after this, you have got to take  care, or Hansie will roast you.\"    \"Oh, Hans is just all right,\" observed Tom, and when the German boy's  face was turned away he took the latter's coffee and put into it about  a teaspoonful of salt. \"Tell you what, fellows, this coffee just  touches the spot,\" he added loudly.    \"Right you are,\" said Fred Garrison. \"Never tasted better in my life.\"    So far Hans had not touched the coffee, but hearing the words he took  up his cup and downed a deep draught. It may be added that he was a  German who loved coffee a good deal, and frequently drank several cups  at a meal.    For an instant the German youth said nothing. Then his face turned  pale.    \"Dat coffee was no goot!\" he gasped.    \"Why, Hans,\" cried several.    \"See how pale he is getting,\" came from George Granbury. \"Hans, are you  going to die?    \"Don't say the coffee is going to poison him,\" burst out Tom. \"I was  reading about poison getting into the coffee at this hotel last week.  But, of course--\"    \"Did da got poison py der coffee in here?\" demanded Hans.    \"To be sure, put--\"    \"How vos dot poisoned coffee taste annahow?\"    \"I'm sure I don't know.\"    \"I think it was a little salty,\" came from Fred Garrison.    \"Mine cracious me! Of dot's so I vos poisoned, sure. Run for der toctor  kvick!\"    \"Here, eat some jam, Hans. That will counteract the effect of  the poison,\" said Tom, and handed over a small dish with jam in it,  over which he had just sprinkled the pepper with an exceedingly liberal  hand.    Anxious to do anything that would stop him from being poisoned, the  German boy clutched the dish and took a large spoonful of the jam. But  as he gulped it, he gave a gasp, and the tears started down his cheeks.    \"_Du meine zeit!_\" he bawled. \"I vos purnt up alife by mine mouth  alretty! Dake it avay kvick!\" And jumping up from the table he began to  dance around madly.    \"It's a serious case,\" said Tom. \"If he's burning up we had better call  out the fire department.\"    This remark made Hans grow suddenly suspicious. He caught up Tom's cup  of coffee and tasted it.    \"I know you, Tom Rofer,\" he said. \"Dot vos more dricks of yours, ain't  it?\" He held the cup of coffee on high. \"How you like dot, hey!\" And  splash! down came the coffee on Tom's head, and trickled down his back.    \"Hi, you! let up!\" roared Tom, and knocked the half-empty cup to one  side. \"Let up, I say, or I'll have the landlord put you out.\"    \"I told you to take care, Tom,\" came from Sam, when the other boys had  restored quietness. \"When Hans gets his dander up he is dangerous.\"    \"Dot is drue,\" came from Hans. \"I vonts no more of them chokes  alretty.\" And then, as the waiter came hurrying up, he forced Tom to  order him another cup of coffee, and took good care to keep it out of  the fun-loving youth's reach. Poor Tom sopped away the spilt coffee as  best he could, but it must be admitted that for the balance of that day  his backbone felt none too comfortable. Yet he bore no grudge towards  Hans, for he knew that he had deserved the punishment meted out to him.    Down at the dock the boys found the _Golden Star_, a trim little  side-wheeler, ready to take them up the lake. There were about half a  hundred passengers, bound for various landings, and among them six  Putnam Hall scholars, including our old-time acquaintances, Jack  Powell, generally called Songbird Powell, because of his habit of  composing poems and songs, and that aristocratic young gentleman who  rejoiced in the name of William Philander Tubbs.    \"The family is surely getting together,\" remarked Dick, after another  handshaking had been indulged in. \"Songbird, do you warble as much as  ever?\"    \"You can wager a sweet potato he does,\" said George Granbury. \"Nothing  short of a cyclone will ever stop Songbird's warbling, eh, Songbird?\"    For reply the youth addressed turned a pair of dreamy eyes on the  speaker, and then said slowly:       \"With hopeful hearts     And brightest faces,     To school we go     To fill our places.     We'll study hard,     And do our best--\"       \"If Songbird Powell     Will give us a rest!\"    finished Tom. \"Oh, Songbird, have mercy on us, and don't begin so early.\"    \"You're a good one to preach, Tom,\" came from Larry. \"Started to joke  the moment we met him, didn't he, Hans?\"    \"Did I?\" questioned Tom innocently. \"I had forgotten.\" He turned to  Tubbs. \"And how is our friend Philliam Willander to-day?\"    \"William Philander, if you please, Rover,\" was the dignified reply. \"I  must insist on your getting my name correctly this term.\"    \"All right, Tubby, old boy, it shall be just as you say. I wouldn't  hurt your feelings for a big red apple.\"    \"Then, please don't call me Tubby. You know my real name is William  Philander Tubbs.\"    \"Don't you want Esquire tacked to it, too?\"    \"That is hardly necessary as yet. But you may write it after my name,  if you have occasion to send me any written communication,\" continued  Tubbs, with greater dignity than ever.    \"Phew! but Tubby is worse than he was before,\" whispered Sam to Dick.  \"They must have been tuning him up at home.\"    \"Tubbs is going to try for a captaincy this term,\" said Powell, who had  not minded Tom's interruption of his versification in the least.    \"Hurrah for Captain Tubbs!\" cried Tom. \"Captain, allow me to salute  you,\" and he made a sweeping bow to the deck. Tom spoke so earnestly  that Tubbs was pleased, and instantly forgot their little differences.    \"I shall be pleased to become a captain,\" said the young gentleman. \"I  feel I can fill the position with credit to myself and dignity to the  academy. There is military blood in my veins, for a second cousin on my  mother's side was a lieutenant in the Civil War. Besides that, I have  studied military movements at West Point, where I went to see the  cadets drill.\"    \"Do you know how to swab out a cannon?\" asked Sam, with a wink at the  others.    \"I shouldn't--ah--care for such dirty work,\" replied William Philander  Tubbs with dignity.    \"Or police a camp?\"    \"Surely you don't think I was ever a policeman?\"    \"Don't you remember what policing a camp is?\" asked George Granbury.    \"Upon my honor, I do not.\"    \"It means to clean up the streets, burn up the rubbish, and all that.\"    \"Thank you, but I do not--ah--care to become a street cleaner,\" returned  Tubbs, with great dignity.    \"Sorry, but I'm afraid you are not cut out for a corporalship,\" came  from Tom.    \"I didn't say a corporalship, Tom, I said--\"    \"Excuse me, I meant a sergeantship.\"    \"No, I said--\"    \"Make it a second lieutenantship, then, Tubby. Anything to be friends,  you know.\"    \"I said--\"    \"Oh, bother, if you want to be a major-general, go ahead. Nobody will  stop you.\"    \"Hurrah, Major-General Tubbs!\" cried Sam. \"That sounds well, doesn't  it, fellows?\"    \"We'll have to present him with a tin-plated sword,\" came from one of  the crowd.    \"And a pair of yellow worsted epaulets,\" added another.    And then Songbird Powell began to sing softly:       \"Rub a dub, dub!      Here comes General Tubb!         He'll make you bow to the ground!      You must stop ev'ry lark,      And toe the chalk "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#5)"],[1,"them under the three-fold division  which has just been mentioned. Before proceeding to do so, it may be as  well to remark that in each case the several factors operate with  different degrees of intensity. It is often extremely difficult to  disentangle them; and the more complex the society is in which a crime  takes place, the greater is the combination and intricacy of the causes  leading up to it.        [10] Cf. E. Ferri. I _Nuovi Orizzonti del Diritto e della Procedura      Penale_.          CHAPTER II.    CLIMATE AND CRIME.      Man's existence depends upon physical surroundings; these surroundings  have exercised an immense influence in modifying his organism, in  shaping his social development, in moulding his character. To enumerate  all the external factors operating upon individual and social life is  outside our present purpose, but they may be briefly summed up as  climate, moisture, soil, the configuration of the earth's surface, and  the nature of its products. These natural phenomena, either singly or  in varying degrees of combination, have unquestionably played a most  prominent part in making the different races of mankind what they at  present are. We have only to look at the low type of life exhibited by  the primitive inhabitants of certain inhospitable regions of the globe  to see how profoundly the physical structure of man is affected by his  natural surroundings. Even a comparatively slight difference of  environment is not without effect upon the population subjected to its  influence. According to M. de Quatrefages, the bodily structure of the  English race has been distinctly modified by residence in the United  States of America. It is not more than two and a half centuries since  Englishmen began to emigrate in any considerable numbers to the  American Continent, but in that comparatively short period the  Anglo-American has ceased to resemble his ancestors in physical  appearance. Alterations have taken place in the skin, the hair, the  neck, and the head; the lower jaw has become bigger; the bones of the  arms and legs have lengthened, and the American of to-day requires a  different kind of glove from the Englishman. Structural changes of a  similar character have taken place in the negroes transplanted to  America. M. Elisee Reclus considers that in a century and a half they  have traversed a good quarter of the distance which separates them from  the whites. Another important point, as showing the influence of  habitat upon race, is the fact that the modifications of human  structure resulting from residence in America are in the direction of  assimilating the European type to that of the red man.[11] In short, it  may be taken as a well-established principle that external nature  destroys all organisms that cannot adapt themselves to its action, and  physiologically modifies all organisms that can.        [11] The various types of Jews also afford a striking instance of      the effect of natural surroundings on bodily structure.    The social condition of mankind is also profoundly affected by climatic  and other external circumstances. The intense cold of the Arctic and  Antarctic regions is fatal to anything approaching a developed form of  civilisation. Intense heat, on the other hand, although not  incompatible with a certain degree of progress, is unfavourable to its  permanence;[12] the extinct societies of the tropics, such as Cambodia,  Mexico and Peru, affording instances of the operation of this law. It  is impossible for man to get beyond the nomad state in the vast deserts  of Northern Africa; and the extreme moisture of the atmosphere in other  portions of the same continent puts an effectual check on anything like  social advance. In some parts of the world social development has been  hindered by external circumstances of another character, such as the  want of wood, the scarcity of animals, the absence of edible fruits. In  fact, it is only within a comparatively temperate zone that human  society has been able permanently to assume highly complex forms and to  build itself up on an extensive scale. In this zone, climate, while  favouring man up to a certain point, has at the same time compelled him  to eat bread in the sweat of his brow. It has compelled him to enter  into conflict with natural obstacles, the result of which has been to  call forth his powers of industry, of energy, of self-reliance, and to  sharpen his intellectual faculties generally. In addition to exercising  and strengthening these personal attributes, the climatic influences of  what has been called the zone of civilisation have brought man's social  characteristics more fully and elaborately into play. The nature of  these influences has forced him to cooperate more or less closely with  his fellows; while each step in the path of cooperation has involved  him in another of a more complex kind. The growth of social cooperation  is not necessarily accompanied by a corresponding development of the  moral sentiments; increased cooperation in some cases involving a  distinct ethical loss. In many directions, however, highly organised  societies tend to evolve loftier types of morality; and it is in  harmony with the facts to say that the highest moral types are not to  be found where nature does most or where it does least in the way of  providing food and shelter for man.        [12] Ratzel. _Voelkerkunde_, i. 20.    It is also interesting to observe the effect which climate, through the  agency of religion, has had upon human conduct. One of the main factors  in the origin of religion is the feeling of dependence upon nature so  strongly manifested in all primitive forms of faith. The outcome of  this feeling of dependence was to exalt the forces of nature into  divinities, and man's conception of these divinities, shaped as it was  by the attitude of nature around him, had an incalculable influence on  his life and actions. The remains of this influence are still visible  in the aesthetic effects which the forces and operations of nature  produce on civilised man; in all other respects it has to a large  extent passed away.[13]        [13] Darwin says that in elaborating his theory of Natural      Selection he attributed too little to external surroundings.      _Life and Letters_.    We have now touched upon most of the ways in which external  surroundings have had a hand in shaping the course of human life in the  past; it will be our next business to inquire whether these  surroundings have any effect upon human conduct at the present day, and  especially upon those manifestations of conduct which are known as  crimes. That they still have an effect is an opinion which has long  been entertained.    Going back to the ancient Greeks, we find Hippocrates holding that all  regions liable to violent changes of climate produced men of fierce,  impetuous and stubborn disposition. \"In approaching southern  countries,\" says Montesquieu, \"one would believe that morality was  being left behind; more ardent passions multiply crimes; each tries to  gain from others all the advantages which can minister to these  passions.\" Buckle believes that the interruption of work caused by  instability of climate leads to instability of character. In analysing  the contents of French statistics, Quetelet,[14] while admitting that  other causes may neutralise the action of climate, proceeds to say that  the \"number of crimes against property relatively to the number of  crimes against the person increases considerably as we advance towards  the north.\" Another eminent student of French criminal statistics, M.  Tarde, comes to very much the same conclusions as Quetelet; he admits  that a high temperature does exercise an indirect influence on the  criminal passions. But the most exhaustive investigations in this  problem have been undertaken in Italy, by Signor Enrico Ferri. After a  thorough examination of French judicial statistics for a series of  years, Ferri arrives at the conclusion that a maximum of crimes against  the person is reached in the hot months, while, on the other hand,  crimes against property come to a climax in the winter.[15]        [14] _Physique Sociale_, ii. 282.        [15] _Zeitschrift fuer Strafrechtswissenschaft_, ii., 486.    In testing these opinions respecting the influence of climate upon  crime, we are obliged, to some extent, to have recourse to  international statistics. But these statistics, as has already been  pointed out, owing to the diversity of customs, laws, criminal  procedure, and so on, do not easily admit of comparison. So much is  this the case that we shall not make the attempt as far as these  statistics have reference to crimes against property. In this field no  satisfactory result can, at present be obtained. The same remark holds  good in relation to all offences against the person, with the exception  of homicide. This, undoubtedly, in an important exception; and it  arises from the fact that there is a greater consensus of opinion among  civilised communities respecting the gravity of homicide than exists  with regard to any other form of crime. Murder in all its degrees is a  crime which immediately causes a profound commotion; it is easy to  recognise; it is more likely than any other offence to come to the ears  of the authorities. For these reasons this crime lends itself most  readily to international comparison; nevertheless, differences of  judicial procedure, legal nomenclature, and different methods of  classification stand in the way of making the comparison absolutely  accurate. These differences, however, are not so great as to render  comparison impossible or worthless; on the contrary, the results of  such a comparison are of exceptional value, and go a long way to  determine the question of the effect of climate upon crimes of blood.    Assuming, then, with these reservations, that such a comparison can be  instituted, let"]]]
