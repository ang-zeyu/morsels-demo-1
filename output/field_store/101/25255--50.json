But no one stirred.    \"Do you hear me?\" cried the proprietor, his highly pitched voice growing  quite shrill.  \"Here, I shall have no end of damages to pay for what  he's doing.  They'll be putting it in the lawyers' hands, and they'll be  charging me a shilling for every apple he eats.--Eh! what's that?  Not  safe?\"    \"No; he's got one of his nasty fits o' temper on,\" said the driver of  the great van which had come to grief.    \"Tchah!  Nonsense!  You are a coward, Jem.\"    \"Mebbe I am,\" grumbled the man; \"but, coward or no, he knocked me flat  over on my back, and once is quite enough for one day.\"    \"Yah!\" shouted his master.  \"You are ready enough to come on Saturday  night for your pay; but if I want anything a little extra done, where am  I?--Here, give me the whip.\"  And he snatched it from the man's hand and  walked towards the great beast, half-hidden among the trees.    \"Say, you boys,\" growled the driver, \"if I was you I'd just be ready to  run.  You've only just got to dodge him.  Stop and make sure which way  he's going, and then get in among the trees.\"    \"Yes, quick: in amongst the trees,\" cried Morris, and he set the  example.    \"Nay,\" growled the man.  \"Not yet.  Wait and see first which way he  means to go.\"    Morris set the example of running in another direction, followed by his  boys and by the voice of the driver.    \"Why, that's worse,\" he cried.  \"That's about the way he'd go.\"    \"Then which--what--why--Here, what are you two laughing at?\"  This to  Glyn, who was stamping about with delight.    \"Oh, I couldn't help it, sir,\" cried the boy, and before he could say  more there was another loud crack of the whip as Ramball made his way  round behind his rebellious beast and shouted at him to \"Come out of  that.\"    He had hardly uttered the words when there was a crashing and breaking  of wood as if the elephant were making its way quickly through the trees  in obedience to the command; and as the sounds ceased, the menagerie  proprietor came staggering out without his handkerchief or whip, to  stand in the middle of his men looking half-stunned and confused.    \"Did he ketch you, sir?\" said the driver, with a laugh of satisfaction  in his twinkling eyes.    \"Brought down his trunk across my back,\" panted the proprietor.  \"My  word, he can hit hard!\"    \"Yes, sir; I know.  Knocked me flat on my back, he did.\"    \"Knocked me on my face,\" cried the proprietor angrily.  \"Look here,\" he  said, \"is there any skin off my nose?  I fell against a tree.\"    \"Took a little bit of the bark off,\" grumbled the man, who did not seem  at all sympathetic.  \"Hadn't you better let him fill hisself full, sir,  and have a rest?  He'll come easy, perhaps, then.\"    \"Do you want me to stand still here and see a devouring elephant go on  eating till he ruins me?  We must all join together and drive him out.\"    \"But he'll drive us out, sir,\" said the man in a tone full of  remonstrance.    \"Then we must try again.  I am not going to be beaten by a beast like  that.\"    \"Look here, my man,\" said Morris, \"hadn't you better tie him up to one  of the trees and leave him till to-morrow?  They do this sort of thing  abroad, I hear, by tying the elephant's legs or ankles to the trunks of  trees.\"    \"What!\" shouted Ramball.  \"Why, he'd take them all up by the roots and  go cantering through the town, doing no end of mischief, with them  hanging to his legs.  Think I want to have to pay for the trees as well  as the apples?\"    \"Then--er--lasso him and lead him home.\"    \"Lass which, sir?\"    \"Lasso him, my man, with ropes.\"    \"Why, he ain't a wild ostrich of the desert, sir.  Look at him!--Here,  one on yer run off and fetch the longest cart-rope.  This 'ere gentleman  would like to have a try.\"    The boys were roaring with laughter by this time, the mathematical  master's parasites joining in as heartily as Glyn and Singh.    \"Don't be rude, fellow,\" said Morris.    \"Don't be rude?\" cried Ramball, who was fuming with disappointment and  rage.  \"Rude yourself.  If you give me much more of your sarce I'll set  the animile at you.\"    As this was proceeding, the elephant, whose taste for apples had been  satiated, came slowly out into the open, to stand bending and bowing his  massive head, which he swayed slowly from side to side and blinked and  flapped his ears, as he watched the assembly with his little reddish  eyes in a way which made the mathematical master grip Slegge by the arm.    \"I am getting uneasy,\" he whispered, \"about you boys.  Don't run, but  follow me slowly back to the fence.  Tell the other boys, and we will go  at once.\"    \"Can't you coax him out, sir?\" said Glyn, as he approached the  proprietor.    \"No, I can't coax him out,\" cried Ramball snappishly; \"but you mind your  own business, I know mine.  I have had enough of you putting your spoons  in my porridge.\"    \"Here, Mr Severn!  Mr Singh!\" shouted the mathematical master.  \"This  way!  We are going back to the college.\"  But he did not go far.    \"But I want to see the elephant brought out, sir,\" replied Singh.  \"He  oughtn't to be left like this.  He may do mischief.\"    \"Oh, now you've begun, have you?\" yelped the proprietor, whose voice in  his anger had gradually reached the soprano.  \"I suppose you would like  to have a try?\"    \"Oh, I don't want to interfere,\" replied Singh coolly.  \"Where do you  want the elephant to go?\"    \"Where do I want him to go?  Why, home of course, before he does any  more mischief.  I wish he was dead; that I do!  And he shall be too.  Here, Jem, run back to Number One--here's the key--and bring my rifle  and the powder-flask and bullet-bag.  I'm sick of him.  He'll be killing  somebody before he's done--a beast!--Tigers is angels to him, sir,\" he  continued appealingly to Morris.  \"He's the wickedest elephant I ever  see, and I've spent more on him in damages than I paid for him at first;  but he's played his last prank, and if I can't drive him I can  shoot.--'Member that lion, my lads, as killed the gentleman's hoss?\"    \"Ay, ay, ay!\" came in a low murmured growl.    \"Got out, sir,\" continued the proprietor, waving one hand about  oratorically, and dabbing his bald head with his hand.  \"Here, some of  you, where's my yellow handkerchy?  Oh, I know; I left it in that there  apple-wood, and I'd lay sixpence, he's picked it up and swallowed it  because it's yellow and he thinks it's the skin of a big orange.  Got  out of his cage, he did, sir, that there lion--been fiddling all night,  I suppose, at the bolts and bars--and we followed him up to where he got  in the loose-box of a gentleman's stable; and there was the poor horse  down--a beauty he was--and that there lion--Arena his name was--lying on  him with his face flattened out and teeth buried in the poor hoss's  throat, so that when I got to the stable door there he was, all eyes and  whiskers, and growling at you like thunder.  I knowed what my work was,  sir,\" continued the proprietor, addressing his conversation entirely to  Morris, \"and you can ask my men, sir; they was there.\"    \"Ay, ay, ay!\" was growled.    \"It warn't the time for showing no white feathers when a lion's got his  monkey up like that.  I brought my gun with me--fine old flint-lock  rifle it is, and I got it now--and the next minute that there dead horse  had got a dead lion lying beside him.  But I sold his skin to a gent for  a ten-pun note, to have it stuffed, and it's in his front hall now, near  Lungpuddle, in Lancashire.--Well, you, are you going to fetch that there  rifle, or am I to fetch it myself?\" he yelled at his man.    \"Oh, I wouldn't shoot him, guv'nor,\" growled the man.    \"What's it got to do with you?\" almost shrieked his master.    \"Oh, I aren't going to lose nothing, guv'nor, only a bit of a chum.  He's knocked me about a bit, and tried to squeeze all the wind out of me  two or three times; but that was only his fun.  I shouldn't like to see  him hurt.\"    \"Then perhaps you'd like to go and fetch him out of that there urcherd?\"  cried his master.    \"He aren't in,\" said the man sturdily; \"and if he were, no, thank you,  to-day.  To-morrow morning perhaps I shouldn't mind; but I do say that  it'd be a burning shame to shoot the finest elephant there is in  England.  The one at the Slogical Gardens in London is nothing to him,  and you know, master, that that's the truth.\"    \"You fetch my rifle.\"    \"I wouldn't talk quite so loud, guv'nor, if I was you,\" replied the man.  \"Elephants is what they call 'telligent beasts, and you don't know but  what that there annymile is a-hearing every word you say and only  waiting till I'm gone to make a roosh, knock you down, and do his  war-dance all over you.\"    \"Hah!  The same as they trample the life out of the tigers at home.\"    Every one turned sharply upon the speaker, whose voice sounded clear and  ringing, as he stood there frowning angrily at the elephant's master.    \"Bah!  Stuff!\" cried the man in his high-pitched voice.  \"I have read  anecdotes about animals, and I know all them stories by heart.  They  look as if they could; but them beasts can't think, and the stories are  all lies.--You be off and fetch that rifle before I send somebody else;  and look here, Jem, if you don't obey my orders you take a fortnight's  notice to quit from next Saturday, when you are paid.\"    \"Then you are going to shoot the elephant,\" cried Glyn, \"because you  don't know how to manage him?\"    \"What!\" half-shrieked the man.  \"Here, I say, where do you go to school?  Things are coming to a pretty pass when boys like you begin teaching  me, who've been nigh forty year in the wild-beast trade!  What next?\"    \"Glyn Severn's right,\" said Singh sternly.    \"Here's another of them!\" cried the man, looking round from face to  face.    \"Quite right,\" continued Singh.  \"Why, the poorest coolie in my father's  dominions would manage one of the noble beasts far better.\"    \"Ho!\" said Ramball sarcastically.  \"T"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],[0,"The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#9)"],[1,"open and his uncle meet him with the blue bundle under  his arm, when the dining-room door did open, and he dashed back to the  landing and stood in the doorway of his mother's room, listening as a  step was heard upon the stairs.    \"Kitty!\" he said to himself, as he thrust against the door, which  yielded to his pressure, and he backed in softly till he could push the  door to, and stand inside, watching through the crack.    There was the light, soft step coming up and up, and his heart began to  beat, he knew not why, till something seemed to rise in his throat, and  made his breath come short and painfully.    His mother!    She was coming to her room, and in another moment she would be there,  and would find him with the bundle under his arm, about to run away.    Quick as thought he looked sharply round, bundle in hand, when, obeying  the first impulse, he was about to push it beneath the bedclothes, but  cast aside the plan because he felt that it would be noticed, and quick  as thought he tossed the light bundle up on the top of the great canopy  of the old-fashioned bedstead, to lie among the gathering of flue and  dust.    By that time the footsteps were at the door.    \"What shall I say?\"  Don asked himself; \"she will want to know why I am  here.\"    He felt confused, and rack his brains as he would, no excuse would come.    But it was not wanted, for the light footstep with the rustle of silk  passed on upstairs, and Don opened the door slightly to listen.  His  breath came thickly with emotion as he realised where his mother had  gone.  It was to his bedroom door, and as he listened he heard her tap  lightly.    \"Don!  Don, my boy!\" came in low, gentle tones.    For one moment the boy's heart prompted him to rush up and fling himself  in her arms, but again his worse half suggested that he was to be  scolded and disbelieved, and mentally thrusting his fingers into his  ears, he stepped out, glided down the staircase in the old boyish  fashion of sliding down the banister, snatched his hat from the stand,  and softly stole out to hurry down the street as hard as he could go.    He had been walking swiftly some five minutes, moved by only one  desire--that of getting away from the house--when he awoke to the fact  that he was going straight towards the constable's quarters and the  old-fashioned lock-up where Mike must be lying, getting rid of the  consequences of his holiday-making that morning.    Don turned sharply round in another direction, one which led him towards  the wharves where the shipping lay.    While this was taking place, Jem Wimble had been banging the doors and  rattling his keys as he locked up the various stores, feeling  particularly proud and self-satisfied with the confidence placed in him.    After this was done he had a wash at the pump, fetching a piece of soap  from a ledge inside the workshop where the cooper's tools were kept, and  when he had duly rubbed and scrubbed and dried his face and hands, he  went indoors to stare with astonishment, for his little wife was making  the most of her size by sitting very upright as she finished her tea.    Jem plumped himself indignantly down, and began his.  This was a new  annoyance.  Sally had scolded times out of number, and found fault with  him for being so late, but this was the first time that she had ever  begun a meal without his being present, and he felt bitterly hurt.    \"As if I could help it,\" he said, half aloud.  \"A man has his work to  do, and he must do it.\"    \"Five o'clock's tea-time, and you ought to have been here.\"    \"And if I wasn't here, it was your dooty to wait for me, marm.\"    \"Was it?\" cried Sally; \"then I wasn't going to.  I'm not going to be  ordered about and ill-treated, Jem; you always said you liked your tea  ready at five o'clock.  I had it ready at five o'clock, and I waited  till half-past, and it's now five-and-twenty to six.\"    \"I don't care if it's five-and-twenty to nineteen!\" cried Jem angrily.  \"It's your dooty to wait, same as it's mine to shut up.\"    \"You might have shut up after tea.\"    \"Then I wasn't going to, marm.\"    \"Then you may have your tea by yourself, for I've done, and I'm not  going to be trampled upon by you.\"    Sally had risen in the loudness of her voice, in her temper, and in her  person, for she had got up from her chair; but neither elevation was  great; in fact, the personal height was very small, and there was  something very kittenish and comic in her appearance, as she crossed the  bright little kitchen to the door at the flight of stairs, and passing  through, banged it behind her, and went up to her room.    \"Very well,\" said Jem, as he sat staring at the door; \"very well, marm.  So this is being married.  My father used to say that if two people as  is married can't agree, they ought to divide the house between 'em, but  one ought to take the outside and t'other the in.  That's what I'm  a-going to do, only, seeing what a bit of a doll of a thing you are, and  being above it, I'm going to take the outside myself.  There's coffee  bags enough to make a man a good bed up in the ware'us, and it won't be  the first time I've shifted for myself, so I shall stop away till you  fetches me back.  Do you hear?\"    \"Oh, yes, I can hear,\" replied Sally from the top of the stairs, Jem  having shouted his last speech.    \"All right, then,\" said Jem: \"so now we understands each other and can  go ahead.\"    Tightening up his lips, Jem rinsed out the slop-basin, shovelled in a  good heap of sugar, and then proceeded to empty the teapot, holding the  lid in its place with one fat finger the while.    This done, he emptied the little milk jug also, stirred all well up  together, and left it for a few minutes to cool, what time he took the  cottage loaf from the white, well-scrubbed trencher, pulled it in two,  took a handful of bread out of one half, and raising the lump of fresh  Somersetshire butter on the point of a knife, he dabbed it into the hole  he had made in the centre, shut it up by replacing the other half of the  bread, and then taking out his handkerchief spread it upon his knee and  tied the loaf tightly therein.  Then for a moment or two he hesitated  about taking the knife, but finally concluding that the clasp knife in  his pocket would do, he laid the blade on the table, gave his tea a  final stir, gulped down the basinful, tucked the loaf in the  handkerchief under his left arm, his hat very much on one side, and then  walked out and through the gate, which he closed with a loud bang.    \"Oh!\" ejaculated Sally, who had run to the bedroom window, \"he has  gone!\"    Sally was quite right, Jem, her husband, was gone away to his favourite  place for smoking a pipe, down on the West Main wharf, where he seated  himself on a stone mooring post, placed the bundle containing the loaf  beside him, and then began to eat heartily?  Nothing of the kind.  Jem  was thinking very hard about home and his little petulant, girlish wife.    Then he started and stared.    \"Hullo, Jem, you here?\"    \"Why, Mas' Don, I thought you was at home having your tea.\"    \"I thought you were having yours, Jem.\"    \"No, Mas' Don,\" said Jem sadly; \"there's my tea\"--and he pointed to the  bundle handkerchief; \"there's my tea; leastwise I will tell the truth,  o' course--there's part on it; t'other part's inside, for I couldn't tie  that up, or I'd ha' brought it same ways to have down here and look at  the ships.\"    \"Then why don't you eat it, man?\"    \"'Cause I can't, sir.  I've had so much o' my Sally that I don't want no  wittals.\"    Don said nothing, but sat down by Jem Wimble to look at the ships.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    KITTY CHRISTMAS SITS UP.    \"My dear Laura,\" said Uncle Josiah that same evening, \"you misjudge me;  Lindon's welfare is as dear to me as that of my little Kitty.\"    \"But you seemed to be so hard and stern with him.\"    \"That is your weak womanly way of looking at it, my dear I may have been  stern, but no more so than the matter warranted.  No, my dear sister,  can you not see that I mean all this as a lesson for Lindon?  You know  how discontented he has been with his lot, like many more boys at his  time of life, when they do not judge very well as to whether they are  well off.\"    \"Yes, he has been unsettled lately.\"    \"Exactly, and this is due to his connection with that ne'er-do-weel  scoundrel, for whom the boy has displayed an unconquerable liking.  Lindon has begged the man on again four times after he had been  discharged from the yard for drunkenness and neglect.\"    \"I did not know this,\" said Mrs Lavington.  \"No, I do not bring all my  business troubles home.  I consented because I wished Lindon to realise  for himself the kind of man whose cause he advocated; but I never  expected that it would be brought home to him so severely as this.\"    \"Then indeed, Josiah, you do not think Lindon guilty?\"    \"Bah!  Of course not, you foolish little woman.  The boy is too frank  and manly, too much of a gentleman to degrade himself in such a way.  Guilty?  Nonsense!  Guilty of being proud and obstinate and stubborn.  Guilty of neglecting his work to listen to that idle scoundrel's  romancing about places he has never seen.\"    \"He is so young.\"    \"Young?  Old enough to know better.\"    \"But if you could bring it home to him more gently.\"    \"I think the present way is an admirable one for showing the boy his  folly.  The bird who kept company with the jackdaws had his neck wrung,  innocent as he was.  I want Lindon to see how very near he has been to  having his neck wrung through keeping company with a jackdaw.  Now, my  dear Laura, leave it to me.  The magistrates will grasp the case at  once, and Master Lindon will receive a severe admonition from some one  else, which will bring him to his senses, and then we shall go on quite  smoothly again.\"    \"You cannot tell how happy you have made me feel,\" said Mrs Lavington,  as she wept silently.    \"We"]]]
