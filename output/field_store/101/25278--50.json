Traders who carry on business jointly, for profit, shall share  the profits and losses, either in proportion to the capital [brought  in by each], or according to the contract between them.[346]    260. [A joint trader] who occasions loss [to the partnership] by  [engaging in] something which his partner has either prohibited or not  sanctioned, or by any negligence, shall make it good: if [on the other  hand by his personal exertion] he preserve anything [of the  partnership property] from loss, he shall have the tenth of it.[347]    261. The monarch, for fixing the prices, should receive a duty of a  twentieth.[348]    If an article of which the sale is prohibited, or one fitting for the  monarch[349] [to possess], be sold [without the royal license], it  shall be forfeited to the Crown.[350]    262. Whoever declares false weight, or avoids the place where custom  is levied, shall be made to pay eight-fold; so he who fraudulently  buys or sells.[351]    263. A ferryman levying [toll as though for] land-duties, shall be  made to pay a fine of ten _panas_.[352]    The same fine is ordained for omission to send invitations to  brahmans of the neighbourhood.[353]    264. On the death of one departed to a foreign country, his male  offspring, his maternal kindred, or those more remotely related, shall  take the property: in their default, the monarch [succeeds].    265. Let the partners of a man who acts dishonestly exclude him from  any share of the profits. Let him who is disabled [to act personally  in the partnership business] act by the agency of another. Thus too it  is enjoined for [associations of] priests[354] farmers, and craftsmen.    266. Capture of a thief by the officer is warranted by [his possession  of] the property stolen, or by traces of him, also by his having been  an offender previously, or his being an inmate of a house of ill  repute.    267. And others there are who may be arrested on suspicion, _viz._,  such as conceal their caste, name, &c., also those addicted to  gambling, to women, and to drinking, and such as have [betrayed  themselves by] a parched mouth in speaking, or a stammering voice;    268. those, moreover, who are inquisitive about others' goods and  houses, or who put on a disguise, or who expend [lavishly] although  they have no [ostensible] income, or who sell things that have been in  use.    269. If one arrested on suspicion of theft do not clear himself, he is  to be punished as a thief, being first compelled to make good the  property stolen.    270. [The monarch] should compel the thief to make restitution of the  stolen articles, and subject him to [such of] the different corporeal  inflictions [as may be proper]: a brahman [who is a thief] he shall  brand and banish the realm.    271. When a murder or theft has occurred, and [the criminal] is not  traced beyond the village, blame falls on the village governor; if [he  be traced] to the public road, blame falls on the governor of the  district; if traced out of the district, the officer charged with  pursuit of criminals shall be to blame.    272. The village within whose boundary [the crime is perpetrated]  shall pay; or [that village shall pay] to which track [of the  criminal] leads; so, if the track lead to a place within a  _krosh_[355] skirting five villages [all shall pay]; so of ten  villages.    273. House-breakers,[356] they who steal horses or elephants,  murderers by open violence--such shall be impaled.    274. He who purloins [apparel, &c.[357]] shall have a hand cut off;  cut-purses,[358] shall have the thumb and fore-finger cut off; for a  second offence, a hand and a foot shall be cut off.    275. For theft of goods of trifling, of medium, and of the highest  value,[359] the penalty to be inflicted is proportioned to the value  of what is stolen. In its determination, place, time, age, and  ability, are to be considered.[360]    276. One who knowingly supplies a thief or a murderer with food,  shelter, fire, water, counsel, implements, or money, incurs the  highest fine.[361]    277. For wounding with weapons, and for causing abortion, the highest  fine is ordained; the highest or the lowest for killing a man or a  woman.    278. A woman incorrigibly wicked, one who has slain a man, one who has  destroyed dams,[362] shall, unless she be in a state of pregnancy, be  thrown into [deep] water with a [heavy] stone tied to her.    279. A woman who is a poisoner, or an incendiary, one who has slain  her husband, her _guru_, or her child, shall be put to death by bulls,  her ears, hands, nose, and lips being cut off.[363]    280. If a man be slain, and it be not known who did the deed, his  sons, kindred, wives, also women who are in habits of illicit  intercourse, are to be separately and without delay questioned,--as  to, whether any quarrel has occurred,    281. whether the deceased was addicted to women, or fond of what is  costly, or seeking gain,[364] also with whom he had gone--or, the  people in the neighbourhood of the place where the murder occurred  shall be examined, by gentle means.    282. Incendiaries of fields, houses, forests, villages,  pasture-grounds or granaries, also one who has intercourse with the  wife of the king, are to be burned in a straw-fire.    283. A man is to be apprehended for adultery, if [found] with another  man's wife in mutual grasping of hair or with recent love-marks, or  when both admit [their fault],    284. or [if the man be found] toying with her girdle, with her  breasts, her upper garment, her thigh, or her hair, or conversing with  her at an unfitting place or hour, or on the same spot with her.[365]    285. The wife, if [so acting] after express prohibition, shall pay one  hundred _panas_ fine; the man, two hundred _panas_: if both have  been expressly prohibited [so demeaning themselves], their punishment  shall be the same as for adultery.[366]    286. For adultery with a woman of equal cast, a man incurs the highest  fine; with a woman of lower cast, the middle fine; with a woman of  higher cast, [the penalty is] death,[367] and the woman is to have her  ears, &c.[368] cut off.    287. If one make off with a virgin decked out [for the bridal], he  shall pay the highest fine; if she be not so circumstanced, then the  lowest fine. Thus it is, if the virgin be of equal cast: if she be of  higher cast, [the penalty of] death is ordained.    288. In the case of a virgin consenting and of inferior cast, no  offence [is committed]; otherwise, there is a fine.[369] For ravishing  her, the man's hand shall be cut off: if the virgin be of the highest  cast, [the penalty is] death.    289. Whoso speaks disparagingly of a woman shall forfeit one hundred  _panas_; but, two hundred, one who brings a false charge against [a  woman]. Whoso has carnal knowledge of a brute animal shall forfeit one  hundred _panas_; if of a lowest cast woman[370] or of a cow, the  middle fine.    290. If a man[371] have carnal intercourse with female slaves or  servants, or even with common women, [such slaves, &c.] being kept [by  those to whom they belong] secluded,[372] he shall pay a fine of fifty  _panas._    291. For forcing a female slave,[373] it is written, there shall be a  fine of ten _panas_; if many [men so] attack one slave, each one  shall pay twenty-four _panas._    292. A public woman who refuses after taking her hire, shall forfeit  twice the amount; so, if the man [decline after contracting, yet] he  shall pay.    293. Whoso knows a woman unnaturally, or voids his water upon a man,  also one who has carnal knowledge of a female mendicant, shall be  fined twenty-four _panas._    294. [The monarch] shall banish him who goes to a woman of the lowest  grade, having branded him with dishonoring emblems: if a Sudra so  act, he shall be [classed among] the lowest. Death shall be to the man  of lowest grade who goes to a respectable woman.    295. Whoso fabricates a royal grant,[374] be it for much or little, or  sets free one who has kidnapped a woman, shall pay the highest fine.    296. One who brings dishonor to a brahman by giving as food what is  unfit to be eaten, is amenable to the highest fine; if to a  kshattriya, the medium fine; if to a vaisya, the lowest fine; if to  Sudra, half the lowest.    297. If one trade with counterfeit gold, or sell tainted meat; three  of his members[375] shall be amputated, and he shall pay the highest  fine.    298. Damage caused by four-footed animals shall not be borne by their  owner, if he have given warning to clear the way: so, with regard to  wood, earth, arrows, stones, a man's arm, or any yoked animals.    299. If death be caused by a vehicle through the breaking of the  [animal's] nose-bridle, or through breaking of the yoke, or the like,  or from its running backwards, the owner is [to be held]  blameless.[376]    300. If the owner of biting or horned animals do not, although able,  rescue [a person attacked], he shall pay the lowest fine: but, if  there was a cry for help, then, double that fine.    301. He who calls an adulterer, 'thief,' shall be made to pay a fine  of five hundred _panas_: whoever releases such an one, being bribed  thereto,[377] shall be made to pay eight-fold the amount [of the  bribe].[378]    302. Whoso speaks what is offensive to the monarch, or reproaches the  monarch, or divulges the monarch's counsel, shall have his tongue  excised and be banished.    303. Whoso makes sale of garments [used to wrap] the dead, or strikes  his _guru_, or seats himself on the vehicle or on the seat of the  monarch, shall pay the highest fine.    304. Whoso beats out both [a person's] eyes, a bearer of odious  tidings to the monarch, also a Sudra holding himself out as a  brahman,--[each of these] shall be fined eight hundred _panas_.    305. Such law suits as have been decided unrighteously shall be  re-investigated by the monarch: [in case of reversal of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21948"],[0,"Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, Beetles, and Other (#9)"],[1,"it does  not have to walk home; it just walks in and goes to sleep under a nice,  smooth stone. Some roam about and some stay at home. These creatures are  pretty much like human beings in their ways.    \"One of the young caddis-worms prefers fishing to walking, like some  other young fellows I know. On a stone near its house it spins a fine  web, turned up-stream, so that any tender little insects floating  down-stream get lodged in it. An easy way to get your dinner--just to go  to a net and eat.\"    The guide paused for a long time, clouds of smoke circling about his  white beard and white hair. The children thought he would never go on.  \"I've had something on my mind for days,\" he said, \"and I'll speak of it  now. The boy or girl who learns most about the ants before September  15th shall win a prize. This prize is to be a magnifying-glass, a book  of colored plates of the insects, very beautiful and very big, and a  five-dollar gold piece.\"    \"A prize, a prize!\" shouted the children, jumping madly about, while  Mrs. Reece and the guide smiled at each other.    \"Now we've had our dinner, our rest, our pipe of peace, a plan for a  prize, and we must push on for the camping-ground. Get the canoes  ready.\"    And, with laughter and talking, the canoes were off up the river again.          X    A NAGGING FAMILY      \"Do you know of a family around here whom no one likes?\" asked Ben Gile.    The lanterns were burning brightly out on the lawn of Turtle Lodge, and  Mrs. Reece had just stopped playing so that the children might rest from  dancing. All the lanterns moved gently to and fro on the piazza; the  children were running about, and everybody seemed to be having a  beautiful and breathless time. \"Do you know of a family around here,\"  called the guide, \"whom nobody likes?\"    \"I do,\" replied Mrs. Reece, laughing and slapping the side of her face.  \"They are just like some people, nagging, annoying, and numerous.\"    \"Do any children here,\" called Ben Gile, for the third time, \"know of a  family nobody likes? For the child who guesses I have a pocket-knife.\"    \"The Smiths!\" shouted Peter. \"My father says Mrs. Smith is always  quarrelling with the choir.\"    \"Hush!\" said Mrs. Reece, seeing danger ahead. \"Ben means a family right  here on the piazza.\"    The children looked at one another, and then Jack turned shrewdly to the  guide. \"I guess, sir, it is mosquitoes and flies.\"    \"Good boy, and here's the knife.\"    Jack thought he had never seen such a wonderful knife. It had three  blades, a corkscrew, a file, and a pair of scissors, and to this day  Jack has that knife.    \"Come,\" said Mrs. Reece, \"let us all sit down for a few minutes while  Lizzie is getting supper ready inside.\"    \"How many wings,\" asked Mrs. Reece, \"has a fly?\"    \"Four,\" answered Jimmie.    \"No,\" corrected the guide; \"a real fly has only two wings. In the place  of the second pair they have queer little knobbed rods which are called  balancers--something like the out-riggers on your scull, Jim. These  steer and steady the fly's body.\"    \"What makes a fly bite?\" asked Hope.    \"They do not bite, child. A beetle or a grasshopper can really bite,  because beetles and grasshoppers have heavy, horny jaws, toothed on the  edge, with which to do it. But a fly has fine, sharp-pointed jaws. With  these needlelike jaws they pierce a hole in the skin, then with a tiny  sucking-beak, made by the rolled lower lip, they draw up the blood  through this opening.\"    \"I wonder whether any little girl here knows why flies should not be  allowed in the house?\" asked Mrs. Reece. No little girl did know  anything except that their mothers were always driving flies out, and  that these creatures buzzed and were a nuisance. \"Do tell them,\" said  Mrs. Reece.    [Illustration:  _A._ House-fly.  _B._ A grown-up mosquito, two larvae, and a pupa.]    \"Well,\" said the guide, \"the fly is such a little acrobat it can crawl  up the steepest and most slippery wall and walk upside down or right  side up with the greatest ease. Perhaps some day you can make a fly keep  still long enough so that you can look at its foot. At the end of the  foot are two little round pads thickly covered with downy hair. On each  side are two sharp claws and many stiff, clinging hairs. With this  flattened foot it can go wherever it wishes.    \"But this same little foot is the chief reason why a fly should never be  allowed in the house, for flies crawl into all sorts of dirty places,  and the fine hairs catch and hold the dirt. When the fly lights on us  or on the table, some of the pieces of dirt are shaken off.\"    \"But they are so hard to catch,\" said Betty; \"it takes Lizzie forever  and forever to get them out of the dining-room in the morning.\"    \"I know why they are hard to catch,\" added Jack, \"for I've looked at a  dead fly. They have such big eyes, like lighthouses, they can see all  around.\"    \"Yes,\" said Ben Gile; \"there is no such thing as creeping up on a fly  unawares. Flies are dirty creatures,\" continued the old man, \"and the  time is not very far distant when people will make war on them just as  they do on mosquitoes. Mrs. Fly lays her eggs in unclean places, and as  many as a hundred eggs at a time. These eggs hatch out quickly. It takes  only twenty-one days to make a chicken out of an egg, but to make a baby  fly it takes only a few hours, and ugly babies they are--little white  maggots, or worms, that live and feed and grow rapidly in dirty places.  Within six days the maggot becomes a tiny, dark-brown pupa, and after  five days the pupa hatches out into a grown-up fly.\"    A dozen little girls at the party made up their minds promptly that  after this evening they, at least, would make war on flies.    \"And aren't flies of any use?\" asked Betty.    \"There is one little fly, Mrs. Tachina-Fly, who is of some use. She is a  cousin of the house-fly. She is of use because she chooses a queer place  to lay her eggs--on the back of a young caterpillar. After these  caterpillars grow and shut themselves up into a cocoon to change into a  butterfly the little fly eggs hatch out into maggots. Of course they are  hungry--all babies are; and finding the nice, fat caterpillar in the  round house, like dutiful babies they eat what is set before them until  the fat, tender caterpillar is eaten up. After they are satisfied they  lie still in their brown skins and change into grown-up tachina-flies,  and at last out come a lot of busy, _buzzing_, bothersome flies. It is  rather hard on the caterpillar. But when we think what harmful, greedy  things most caterpillars are, perhaps it is good that there are  tachina-flies to eat them. Is it time for supper yet?\"    \"No, not yet,\" replied Mrs. Reece. \"Do tell the children something about  mosquitoes.\"    \"If I had to choose between Mr. and Mrs. Mosquito, I should take Mr.  Mosquito, for he neither bites nor buzzes, but attends strictly to his  own business. Perhaps he thinks Mrs. Mosquito's voice pretty. Perhaps he  likes to hear about her adventures. But most people do not, for they  think Mrs. Mosquito a busybody, always going where she is not wished,  always breaking up conversations, and always coming back after she has  been plainly told that she is not wanted. Yet her singing is music in  the ears of her husband. Perhaps if we had long, slender antennae, all  covered with hairs, like his, we, too, might like her song. When she  sings these hairs begin to tremble, to vibrate, and a little nerve in  the antennae changes this trembling to sound.    \"In every way Mr. Mosquito seems a more pleasant body. He eats very  little, and contents himself with nectar. But she, knowing that  excitement makes the blood flow faster, and being a hearty eater, begins  her song gently at first, then louder and louder, nearer and nearer.  Finally, with her long, slender, sharp stylets, she makes a hole in your  cheek or your arm, pushes in her sucking-beak, and pumps up the blood.  And there she sucks and sucks until her stomach is full or she is  brushed off or killed.\"    \"Where do mosquitoes lay eggs?\" asked Jack, who was certain that  everything in the insect world did lay eggs, as indeed everything does.    \"In the water; any puddle will do. When the eggs hatch out they are  funny-looking fellows, long, tapering bodies with a big head end. At the  other end are two little prongs. This baby, like some other babies, is  never quiet, but squirms and wriggles so that it is called a wriggler.  Upon its thick head are two little tufts of hair. These it waves every  moment, so that all the food which comes its way will go into its hungry  little mouth. One of the prongs at the other end of the body is an  air-tube, so that the baby mosquito has to stand on its head to breathe.  It hangs head downward, and holds its air-tube above the surface of the  water.    \"When people pour kerosene upon the water the wriggler cannot get any  air to breathe, and therefore dies. Within a few days the wriggler  changes its skin three times; after the third change it looks very  different, and is called a pupa. Now, instead of having an air-tube at  the end, it has two on the back of the thorax. At the tail end are two  flaps to help it swim. Even the pupa is never still a minute, but holds  its air-tubes above the water's surface.    \"When anything comes to disturb it, it uses its flaps and swims safely  to the bottom of the pool. At the end of two days out of the pupa skin  comes a grown-up mosquito. If it is a Mrs. Mosquito, she promptly begins  to bite people and to carry about fevers or malaria from person to  person. The bite of a mosquito may sometimes be as dangerous as the bite  of a rattlesnake.\"    The children had been slapping the mosquitoes buzzing about on the  _piazza_. \"And now,\" said the guide, \"before we go into supper, I will  tell you a real and a true story. Mosquitoes sometimes carry sickness  from one person to another until it spreads"]]]
