Man looks grand in his armour and feathers.\"    \"But I'm only a boy,\" said Roy, sadly.    \"Who's to know that when you're in armour and your visor down, sir?  A  suit of armour like that, and you on a grand horse, would make a man of  you.  It's fine, and no mistake.\"    \"But you were sneering at armour a little while ago, Ben,\" said Roy.    \"For fighting in, sir, but not for show.  You see, there's something  about armour and feathers and flags that gets hold of people, and a  soldier's a man who likes to look well.  I'm an old un now, but I  wouldn't say no to a good new uniform, with a bit o' colour in it; but  if you want me to fight, I don't want to be all plates and things like a  lobster, and not able to move.  I want to be free to use my arms.  Right  enough for show, sir, and make a regiment look handsome; but fighting's  like gardening,--want to take your coat off when you go to work.\"    \"But you will get that armour ready, Ben?\"    \"Course I will, sir.  On'y too glad to see you take a liking to a bit o'  armour and a sword.  Now, then, what do you say to beginning again?\"    \"I'm ready,\" said Roy, but with a longing look at the armour.    \"Then you shall just put that helmet on, and have the visor down.  You  won't be able to see so well, but it will save your face from an  accidental cut.\"    He placed the helmet on the boy's head, adjusted the cheek straps, and  drew back.    \"Find it heavy, sir?\"    \"Rather!  Feels as if it would topple off as soon as I begin to move.\"    \"But it won't, sir.  The leather cap inside will stop that.  Now, then,  if you please, we'll begin.  I'm going to cut at you slowly and softly,  and you've got to guard yourself, and then turn off.  I shall be very  slow, but after a bit I shall cut like lightning, and before I've done I  shan't be no more able to hit you than you're able now to hit me.\"    Roy said nothing, and the man began cutting at him to right and to left,  upward from the same direction and downward, as if bent upon cleaving  his shoulders; and for every cut Ben showed him how to make the proper  guard, holding his weapon so that the stroke should glance off, and  laying especial weight upon the necessity for catching the blow aimed  upon the _forte_ of the blade toward the hilt, and not upon the _faible_  near the point.    Then came the turn of the head, and the horizontal and down right cuts  were, after further instruction, received so that they, too, glanced  off.  Roy gaining more and more confidence at every stroke.  But that  helmet was an utter nuisance, and half buried the wearer.    \"I'm beginning to think you're right, Ben, about the armour,\" said the  lad, at last.    \"Yes, 'tis a bit awkward, sir; but you'll get used to it.  If you can  defend yourself well with that on, why, of course, you can without.  Now, then, suppose, for a change, you have a cut at me.\"    \"Why, what tomfoolery is this?\" said a highly-pitched voice; and Roy  tried to snatch off his helmet as he caught sight of the secretary  standing in the door-way looking on.    But the helmet would not come off easily, and, after a tug or two, Roy  was fain to turn to the old soldier.    \"Here,\" he said, hastily, \"unfasten this, Ben, quick!\"    \"Yes, sir; but I don't see as you've any call to be in such a hurry.  You've a right to learn to use a sword if you like.  Only the strap  fastened over this stud, and there you are.\"    Red-faced and annoyed, Roy faced the secretary, who had walked slowly  into the armoury, to stand looking about him with a sneer of contempt  upon his lip.    \"Only practising a little sword-play, sir,\" said the boy, as soon as his  head was relieved.    \"Sword-play!  Is there no other kind of play a boy like you can take to?  What do you want with sword-play?\"    \"My father's a soldier,\" said Roy.    \"Yes; but you are not going to be a fighting man, sir; and, behindhand  as you are with your studies, I think you might try a little more to do  your instructor credit, and not waste time with one of the servants in  such a barbaric pursuit as this.  Lady Royland is waiting breakfast.  You had better come at once.\"    Feeling humbled and abashed before the old soldier, Roy followed the  secretary without a word, and they entered the breakfast-room together,  Lady Royland looking up pale and disturbed, and, upon seeing her son's  face, exclaiming--    \"Why, Roy, how hot and tired you look!  Have you been running?\"    The secretary laughed contemptuously.    \"No, mother; practising fencing with Ben.\"    \"Oh, Roy!\" cried his mother, reproachfully; \"what can you want with  fencing?  My dear boy, pray think more of your books.\"    Master Pawson gave the lad a peculiar look, and Roy felt as if he should  like to kick out under the table so viciously that the sneering smile  might give place to a contraction expressing pain.    But Roy did not speak, and the breakfast went on.        CHAPTER SIX.    BEN MARTLET FEELS RUSTY.    \"Come to me in half an hour, Roy,\" said Master Pawson, as they rose from  the table, the boy hurrying away to the armoury to find Ben busy as  ever, and engaged now in seeing to the straps and fittings of the  Italian suit of bronzed steel.    \"Thought I'd do it, sir,\" he said, \"in case you ever asked for it; but I  s'pose it's all over with your learning to be a man now.\"    \"Indeed it is not,\" said Roy, sharply.  \"I'm sure my father would not  object to my learning fencing.\"    \"Sword-play, sir.\"    \"Very well--sword-play,\" said Roy, pettishly; \"so long as I do not  neglect any studies I have to go through with Master Pawson.\"    \"And I s'pose you've been a-neglecting of 'em, sir, eh?\" said the old  man, drily.    \"That I've not.  Perhaps I have not got on so well as I ought, but  that's because I'm stupid, I suppose.\"    \"Nay, nay, nay!  That won't do, Master Roy.  There's lots o' things I  can do as you can't; but that's because you've never learnt.\"    \"Master Pawson's cross because I don't do what he wants.\"    \"Why, what does he want you to do, sir?\"    \"Learn to play the big fiddle.\"    \"What!\" cried the man, indignantly.  \"Then don't you do it, my lad.\"    \"I don't mean to,\" said Roy; \"and I don't want to hurt my mother's  feelings; and so I won't make a lot of show over learning sword-play  with you, but I shall go on with it, Ben, and you shall take the swords  or sticks down in the hollow in the wood, and I'll meet you there every  morning at six.\"    \"Mean it, sir?\"    \"Yes, of course; and now I must be off.  I was to be with Master Pawson  in half an hour.\"    \"Off you go, then, my lad.  Always keep to your time.\"    Roy ran off, and was going straight to Master Pawson's room in the  corner tower, but on the way he met Lady Royland, who took his arm and  walked with him out into the square garden.    \"Why, mother, you've been crying,\" said the boy, tenderly.    \"Can you see that, my dear?\"    \"Yes; what is the matter?  I know, though.  You're fretting about not  hearing from father.\"    \"Well, is it not enough to make me fret, my boy?\" she said,  reproachfully.    \"Of course!  And I'm so thoughtless.\"    \"Yes, Roy,\" said Lady Royland, with a sad smile; \"I am afraid you are.\"    \"I try not to be, mother; I do indeed,\" cried Roy; \"but tell me--is  there anything fresh?  Yes; you've had some bad news!  Then you've heard  from father.\"    \"No, my boy, no; the bad news comes through Master Pawson.  He has heard  again from his friends in London.\"    \"Look here, mother,\" cried the boy, hotly, \"I want to know why he should  get letters easily, and we get none.\"    Lady Royland sighed.    \"Father must be too busy to write.\"    \"I am afraid so, my dear.\"    \"But what is the bad news he has told you this morning?\"    They were close up to the foot of the corner tower as Roy asked this  question; and, as Lady Royland replied, a few notes of some air being  played upon the violoncello high up came floating down to their ears.    \"He tells me that there is no doubt about a terrible revolution having  broken out, my boy; that the Parliament is raising an army to fight  against the king, and that his friends feel sure that his majesty's  cause is lost.\"    \"Then he doesn't know anything about it, mother,\" cried the boy,  indignantly.  \"The king has too many brave officers like father who will  fight for him, and take care that his cause is not lost.  Oh, I say,  hark to that!\"    \"That\" was another strain floating down to them.    \"Yes,\" said Lady Royland, sadly; \"it is Master Pawson playing.  He is  waiting for you, Roy.\"    \"Yes, playing,\" said the boy, hotly.  \"It makes me think of what I read  with him one day about that Roman emperor--what was his name?--playing  while Rome was burning.  But don't you fret, mother; London won't be  burnt while father's there.\"    \"You do not realise what it may mean, my boy.\"    \"Oh, yes, I think I do, mother; but you don't think fairly.  You are too  anxious.  But there!  I must go up to him now.\"    \"Yes, go, my boy; and you will not cause me any more anxiety than you  can help?\"    \"Why, of course I won't, mother.  But if it is going to be a war, don't  you think I ought to learn all I can about being a soldier?\"    \"Roy!  No, no!\" cried Lady Royland, wildly.  \"Do I not suffer enough on  your father's account?\"    \"There, I won't say any more, mother dear,\" said Roy, clinging to her  arm; \"and now I'll confess something.\"    \"You have something to confess?\" said Lady Royland, excitedly, as she  stopped where they were, just beneath the corner tower, and quite  unconscious of the fact that a head was cautiously thrust out of one of  the upper windows and then drawn back, so that only the tip of an ear  and a few curls were left visible.  \"Then, tell me quickly, Roy; you  have been keeping back some news.\"    \"No, no, mother, not a bit; just as if I would when I know how anxious  you are!  It was only this.  Old Ben is always grumbling about the place  going to ruin, as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25452"],[0,"The Kangaroo Marines (#9)"],[1," now faced the outposts of the enemy.  This was the second stage  of the attack.  The \"screen\" now came up and thickened the Australian  line.  Many officers came with it, so Bill, without protest, vacated  the post of \"general.\"    \"Bang, bang, bang!\" went the rifles.  \"Z-r-r-p-rip-rip!\" went the  machine-guns, while the sullen boom of the field artillery in rear  indicated that matters were becoming interesting.    \"Advance by rushes,\" ordered the senior Australian officer in the front  line.    \"Why don't you let us give 'em the bayonet?\" muttered Bill, disagreeing  with the tactics of his superior.    \"Shut up,\" ordered an old sergeant.    \"All right, funny-face.\"    \"Consider yourself a prisoner,\" was the final word of the N.C.O. as  they went forward on the rush.  Bill wished for more than a round of  blank.    Section after section took up a new line.  Then the rushes started  again.  All the time the rifles were spitting out their fire.  They  reached within fifty yards of the outpost line.  As this was simply a  protective screen, and not the line of resistance, the enemy's outpost  companies commenced to fade away systematically in the direction of  their main body.    \"Prepare to charge,\" ordered the officer.    \"With bayonets?\" queried Bill.    \"No,\" he snapped.    \"Wot's a bloomin' bayonet for?\" asked Bill when the officer was out of  hearing.    \"For openin' jam tins, ye fathead,\" said Paddy.    \"Charge!\"  The long line rose like one man.  With a great cheer they  swept away the remnants of the outpost companies and occupied the  ridge.  This gave the Australians a complete view of the main position.  Both flanks rested on impassable obstacles.  The front was secured by  imaginary entanglements, backed up by a series of trenches and an array  of Maxims and guns.  This was the information required by the  Australian G.O.C.  The reconnaissance had served its purpose.  The  \"Assembly\" was sounded, and the field day seemed done.    But war is full of surprises, and it is the surprises which make or mar  a general's name.  While General Fearless and his force were rallying  for lunch all were suddenly surprised by a fearful roll of musketry on  the right.    \"By gad, sir--we're trapped!\" said the Chief of Staff, jumping up.  \"Shall I order the brigades to form to the right, and meet this attack?\"    \"No,\" said Fearless, coolly eating his sandwich.  \"Get me some  information.\"    \"But they may decimate us in the meantime, sir.\"    \"Get me information, please,\" was the quiet and more firm command.    Two aides-de-camp were sent at the gallop towards the mysterious force  which had suddenly appeared and was furiously firing blank.  They found  the New Zealanders pressing on in three separate lines towards them.    \"It's a proper trap,\" said one of the gallopers.  \"And look to our  rear.  There's more there.  This flank business is a feint.  They're  trying to smash us behind, and they're 'cute enough not to fire a shot  from that direction.  Say, Brown, gallop back and tell the general, and  I'll try and bluff this front line here.\"  Away went the messenger  while the other young staff officer galloped into the front line of New  Zealanders.    \"The New Zealanders will cease fire,\" said the daring galloper.  His  staff cap commanded the respect of an innocent subaltern.  He blew his  whistle.  More whistles were heard.  In two minutes all was  comparatively still.    \"You will commence firing again in fifteen minutes.  Pass it along.\"  Down the line went the false order.  Smiling inwardly, the shrewd  aide-de-camp galloped away.  Meantime the Australian G.O.C. had acted  vigorously.  Throwing out two regiments to hold the feinting force on  his right, he then turned the other brigades about.  These were  deployed at the double, sent forward with a rush, and, in three  minutes, dug shelter trenches in the sand.  They were ordered to keep  low until the main body of the New Zealanders pressed the attack well  home.  It was an exciting moment.  And the Maorilanders expected an  easy win.  On they came in their long skirmishing lines.  At last they  were within fifty yards of the hidden Australians.    \"Rapid fire!\"    Bang!  Zrrrp--Boom!  Boom!  Boom! crashed rifles, Maxims, and guns.  The New Zealanders were startled.  Before they had recovered from their  surprise, Fearless ordered the \"Charge!\"  Like deerhounds, his men rose  up and dashed pell-mell into the panic-stricken host.  There was a  shock, a wavering, and then a pell-mell rush to the rear.  The  Australians had won.  They had _not_ been surprised.    \"Cease fire!  Sound the 'Officers' Call,'\" ordered the chief umpire,  galloping up.  From far and near came the leaders to the pow-wow.          *      *      *      *      *    \"Well, gentlemen,\" said the umpire (the Commander-in-Chief), \"I've seen  much to-day.  There has been little to deplore and a great deal to  commend.  Throughout the whole show there has been shown skill,  enthusiasm, and dash.  Leadership was good, communication fair, and  nothing very rash was done.  Your eight months' training has improved  you beyond recognition.    \"To-day I tested our Australian friends.  I planned to trick them, to  throw them into confusion, and to cause a general panic by a sudden  onslaught while they were resting and apparently finished for the day.  The trap failed because General Fearless was cool and appreciated the  situation.  That, to me, is an important point.  The surprises of war  are the things which make us or break us.  Surprises in South Africa  smashed more reputations than anything else.  It is perfectly easy at  manoeuvres to carry out a scheme laid down.  It is not easy suddenly to  meet a dramatic development or side issue.    \"Now for another point.  Our colonial friends still suffer from an  abundance of vitality and the too daring use of the initiative.  That  is a good fault, and yet a bad one.  In guerilla warfare it would be a  tremendous asset.  In a concerted scheme it might prove disastrous.  No  matter how daring and clever the individual soldier or officer, if he  forgets that there are men, sections, regiments, and brigades to his  right or left--if he fails to appreciate the full value of  co-ordination and co-operation, he is a danger to himself and his  force.  Of course, gentlemen, I fully appreciate that this charming  recklessness of our overseas cousins is due to temperament, not to  intent or a desire to be big at the expense of their fellows.  That is  why we have trained you so hard.  Without any desire to give offence, I  say boldly that the Australians and New Zealanders are an infinitely  better trained, better disciplined, and, therefore, a more useful body  of men than was sent by these Dominions to South Africa.    \"It has been a very long, weary road, gentlemen.  Your men, I am sure,  have cursed me often.  But grousing is the privilege of the soldier.  Indeed, I always suspect the man who doesn't grouse.  He is either too  meek, or else he is like a Quaker--far too respectable.  And this great  camp of ours would, indeed, be dull without the original adjectives of  our Australasians.    \"That is all, gentlemen, except this--and it is important--in a few  weeks you will be in active service.  We expect great things of the  Australasians, the Twenty-ninth Division, and our Lancashire men; and I  know that we shall receive of your best.  Good-day, gentlemen.\"  And  off rode the handsome courtier and soldier with a rousing cheer ringing  in his ears.  There's nothing like brains; and there's a great deal in  tact.  Ask a colonial.          CHAPTER VII    THE LANDING    A great convoy of transports, guarded by destroyers, ploughed silently  through the waters which lap the European side of the Gallipoli  Peninsula.  The ships had the Australian force on board, and the  destroyers were there to assist them in one of the most daring missions  in modern war.    All lights were out and strict silence was observed.  Each man had,  therefore, time to commune with the spirits of those nine thousand  miles away.  It was not a time for the buffoon; they were faced with  all the dread perils of war.    Nearer and nearer the ships drew to their objective.  At last they  reached the point assigned them by the Staff.  A quiet signal was  given.  Destroyers, pinnaces, and row boats were placed at the sides of  the transports, rough gangways thrown out, and the command to move  quietly was passed along.  Noiselessly they stepped from the  transports; but all the while there was an electric-like feeling around  the heart--that peculiar something which only the soldier knows.  However, there wasn't time to romance or moralise.  War rules out  sentiment and fears.  There was a job to be done.    When each boat was packed with its human freight, the gangways were  slipped, cables thrown off, and all were quietly towed to the shore.  It was still dark--one hour, in fact, before the dawn.  When close  inshore, the hand of Providence proved kind.  This took the form of a  strong current--so strong, in fact, that it pressed the boats away from  the point previously assigned for the landing and washed them into a  safer part for the historic encounter.    That current saved thousands of Australian lives; indeed, it may have  ensured the success of the mission.  Had the Australians landed at the  point decided on, it is doubtful whether the landing would have been so  thoroughly effective as it proved on the other beach.    \"Not much doing--eh?\" said Colonel Killem to his adjutant as he peered  through the darkness to the shore.  Indeed, it seemed that the enemy  had left this shore unguarded.  But the Turks are wily soldiers.  They  allowed the boats to near the shore, then opened up a murderous rifle  and machine-gun fire.    \"Gad!  Boys, I'm hit!\" said a subaltern, falling, his blood spurting in  a stream all over his clothes.    \"So'm I!\" said another youngster with a ping "]]]
