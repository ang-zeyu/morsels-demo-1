Alexander III.  was Pope at that time, and according to this traveller, he included  some Jews among his ministers. Among the monuments of special  interest in the eternal city, he mentions St. Peter's and St. John  Lateran, but his descriptions are not interesting. From Rome by  Capua, and Pozzuoli, then partly inundated, he went to Naples, where  he seems to have seen nothing but the five hundred Jews living  there; then by Salerno, Amalfi, Benevento, Ascoli, Trani, St.  Nicholas of Bari, and Brindisi, he arrived at Otranto, having  crossed Italy and yet found nothing interesting to relate of this  splendid country.    The list of the places Benjamin of Tudela visited, is not  interesting, but we must not omit to mention one of them, for his  narrative is most precise, and it is useful to follow his route by  the maps specially prepared for this purpose by Lelewel. From  Otranto to Zeitun, his halting-places were Corfu, the Gulf of Arta,  Achelous, an ancient town in AEtolia, Anatolia in Greece, on the  Gulf of Patras, Patras, Lepanto, Crissa, at the foot of Mount  Parnassus, Corinth, Thebes, whose two thousand Jewish inhabitants  were the best makers of silk and purple in Greece, Negropont and  Zeitoun. Here, according to the Spanish traveller, is the  boundary-line of Wallachia; he says the Wallachians are as nimble  as goats, and come down from the mountains to pillage the  neighbouring Greek towns.    Benjamin of Tudela went on to Constantinople by way of Gardiki, a  small township on the Gulf of Volo, Armyros, a port much frequented  by the Venetians and Genoese, Bissina, a town of which no traces are  left, Salonica, the ancient Thessalonica, and Abydos. He gives us  some details of Constantinople; the Emperor Emmanuel Comnenus was  reigning at that time and lived in a palace that he had built upon  the sea-shore, containing columns of pure gold and silver, and \"the  golden throne studded with precious stones, above which a golden  crown is suspended by a chain of the same precious metal, which  rests upon the monarch's head as he sits upon the throne.\" In this  crown are many precious stones, and one of priceless worth: \"so  brilliant are they,\" says this traveller, \"that at night, there is  no occasion for any further light than that thrown back by these  jewels.\" He adds that there is a large population in the city, and  for the number of merchants from all countries who assemble there,  it can only be compared to Baghdad. The inhabitants are principally  dressed in embroidered silk robes enriched with golden fringes, and  to see them thus attired and mounted upon their horses, one would  take them for princes, but they are not brave warriors, and they  keep mercenaries from all nations to fight for them. One regret he  expresses, and that is, that there are no Jews left in the City, and  that they have all been transported to Galata, near the entrance of  the port, where are nearly two thousand five hundred of the sects  (Rabbinites and Caraites), and among them many rich merchants and  silk manufacturers, but the Turks have a bitter hatred for them, and  treat them with great severity. Only one of these rich Jews was  allowed to ride on horseback, he was the Emperor's physician,  Solomon, the Egyptian. As to the remarkable buildings of  Constantinople, he mentions the Mosque of St. Sophia, in which the  number of altars answers to the number of days in a year, and the  columns and gold and silver candlesticks, are too numerous to be  counted; also the Hippodrome, which at the present day is used as a  horse-market, but was then the scene of combats between \"lions,  bears, tigers, other wild beasts, and even birds.\"    [Illustration: The approach to Constantinople.]    When Benjamin of Tudela left Constantinople, he visited Gallipoli  and Kilia, a port on the Eastern coast, and went to the islands in  the Archipelago, Mitylene, Chios, whence there was much trade in the  juice of the pistachio-tree, Samos, Rhodes, and Cyprus. As he sailed  towards the land of Aram, he passed by Messis, by Antioch, where he  admired the arrangements for supplying the city with water, and by  Latakia on his way to Tripoli, which he found had been recently  shaken by an earthquake, that had been felt for miles round. We next  hear of him at Beyrout, at Sidon, and Tyre, celebrated for its glass  manufactory, at Acre, at Jaffa near Mount Carmel, at Capernaum, at  the beautiful town of Caesarea, at Samaria, which is built in the  midst of a fertile tract, where are vineyards, gardens, orchards,  and olive-yards, at Nablous, at Gibeon, and then at Jerusalem.    In the holy city, it was but natural that the Jew could see nothing  that would have interested a Christian visitor. For him, Jerusalem  appeared only a small town, defended by three walls and peopled with  Jews, Syrians, Greeks, Georgians, and Franks of all languages and  nations. He found four hundred horse-soldiers in the city ready for  war at any moment, a great temple in which is the tomb of \"that  man,\" as the Talmud styles our Saviour, and a house in which the  Jews had the privilege of carrying on the work of dyeing; but they  were few in number, scarcely two hundred, and they lived under the  tower of David at one corner of the city. Outside Jerusalem, the  traveller mentions the tomb of Absalom, the sepulchre of Osias, the  pool of Siloam, near the brook Cedron, the valley of Jehoshaphat,  and the Mount of Olives, from whose summit one can see the Dead Sea.  Two leagues from it stands the pillar of Lot's wife, and the  traveller adds, \"that though the flocks and herds which pass this  pillar of salt are continually licking it, yet it never diminishes  in size.\" From Jerusalem, Benjamin of Tudela went to Bethlehem, and  inscribed his name on Rachel's tomb, as it was customary for all  Jews to do who passed by it; and from Bethlehem, after counting  twelve Jewish dyeing establishments, he went on to Hebron, which is  now deserted and in ruins.    After visiting, in the plain of Machpelah, the tombs of Abraham,  Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah, and passing by Beth-Jairim,  Scilo, Mount Moriah, Beth-Nubi, Ramah, Joppa, Jabneh, Azotus,  Ascalon, built by Esdras, Lud, Tiberias, where are some hot springs,  Gish and Merom, which is still a spot visited by Jewish pilgrims,  Kedesh and Laish, near the cavern, where the Jordan takes its rise,  the traveller left the land of Israel, and entered Damascus.    The following is his description of this city, where the Turkish  rule begins. \"It is a very large and beautiful city, walled round,  and outside the walls for fifteen miles are gardens and orchards,  and of all the surrounding country, this is the most fertile spot.  The town stands at the foot of Mount Hermon, whence rise the two  rivers, Abana and Pharpar; the first passes through the city, and  its waters are taken into the larger houses by means of aqueducts,  as well as through the streets and markets. This town trades with  all the world. The river Pharpar fertilizes the orchards and gardens  outside the town. There is an Ishmaelitish mosque, called  Goman-Dammesec, meaning the synagogue of Damascus, and this building  has not its equal; it is said to have been Benhadad's palace, and it  contains a glass wall, built apparently by magic. This wall has 365  holes in it, answering to the days of the year; as the sun rises and  sets it shines through one or other of these holes, so that the hour  of the day may thus always be known. Inside the palace or mosque are  gold and silver houses, large enough to hold two or three persons at  a time, if they wish to wash or bathe in them.\"    After going to Galad and Salkah, which are two days' journey from  Damascus, Benjamin reached Baalbec, the Heliopolis of the Greeks and  Romans, built by Solomon, in the valley of the Libanus, then to  Tadmor, which is Palmyra, also built entirely of great stones. Then  passing by Cariatin, he stopped at Hamah, which was partially  destroyed by an earthquake in 1157, which overthrew many of the  Syrian towns.    Now comes in the narrative a list of names, which are of no great  interest: we may mention among them, Nineveh, whence the traveller  returned towards the Euphrates; and finally that he reached Baghdad,  the residence of the Caliph.    Baghdad was of great interest to the Jewish traveller; he says it is  a large town three miles in circumference, containing a hospital  both for Jews and sick people of any nation. It is the centre for  learned men, philosophers, and magicians from all parts of the world.  It is the residence of the Caliph, who at this time was probably  Mostaidjed, whose dominion included western Persia and the banks of  the Tigris. He had a vast palace, standing in a park watered by a  tributary of the Tigris and filled with wild beasts, he may be taken  as a model sovereign on some points; he was a good and very truthful  man, kind and considerate to all with whom he came in contact. He  lived on the produce of his own toil, and made blankets, which,  marked with his own seal, were sold in the market by the princes of  his court, to defray the expense of his living. He only left his  palace once a year, at the feast of Ramadan, when he went to the  mosque near the Bassorah gate, and there acting as Iman, he  explained the law to his people. He returned to his palace by a  different route which was carefully guarded all the rest of the year,  so that no other passer by might profane the marks of his footsteps.  All the brothers of the Caliph inhabit the same palace as he does;  they are all treated with much respect, and have the government of  provinces and towns in their hands, the revenues from them enabling  them to pass a pleasant life; only, as they once rebelled against  their sovereign, they are now all fettered with chains of iron, and  have guards mounted before their houses.

[Pageheading: EDUCATION IN INDIA]    [Pageheading: SIR HENRY HARDINGE]      _Sir Henry Hardinge to Queen Victoria._    _23rd November 1844._    Sir Henry Hardinge[34] with his most humble duty to your Majesty,  humbly submits for your Majesty's consideration the following  observations on the state of affairs in this large portion of your  Majesty's dominions.    The return of peace has also increased the desire of the native  population to receive the advantages of English education. The  literature of the West is the most favourite study amongst the Hindoos  in their schools and colleges. They will discuss with accuracy the  most important events in British History. Boys of fifteen years of  age, black in colour, will recite the most favourite passages  from Shakespeare, ably quoting the notes of the English and German  commentators. They excel in mathematics, and in legal subtleties their  acuteness is most extraordinary.    In order to reward native talent and render it practically useful to  the State, Sir Henry Hardinge, after due deliberation, has issued a  resolution, by which the most meritorious students will be appointed  to fill the public offices which fall vacant throughout Bengal.    This encouragement has been received by the Hindoo population with the  greatest gratitude. The studies in the Mohammedan schools and colleges  have hitherto been confined to Arabic, the Koran, and abstruse studies  relating to their religion, having always shown a marked aversion to  English literature. Since the publication of the Resolution they have  at once determined to change their system in order to participate in  the benefits held out to native merit of every sect.    It is impossible throughout your Majesty's immense Empire to employ  the number of highly paid European civil servants which the public  service requires. This deficiency is the great evil of British  Administration. By dispersing annually a proportion of well-educated  natives throughout the provinces, under British superintendence,  well-founded hopes are entertained that prejudices may gradually  disappear, the public service be improved, and attachment to British  institutions increased....    Sir Henry Hardinge, in closing these observations, most humbly  ventures to assure your Majesty that he anticipates no occurrence as  probable, by which the tranquillity of this portion of your Majesty's  dominions is likely to be disturbed.    H. HARDINGE.        [Footnote 34: Governor-General of India, in succession to Lord      Ellenborough.]          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    TO CHAPTER XIV      The new year (1845) opened auspiciously, trade improving owing to the  great impetus given to it by the many lines of railway then in  course of promotion. Over two hundred schemes were prepared at  the commencement of the session to seek legislative sanction, and  speculation outran all reasonable limits. The Income Tax (which in the  ordinary course would have expired) was renewed, and the Anti-Corn  Law Leaguers were more persistent than ever in their assaults on  Protection, while the attacks on the Ministry from a section of their  own party were redoubled. The most remarkable measure of the year was  the Government Bill for increasing the grant to the Roman Catholic  College of Maynooth, which was strongly opposed from the Conservative  and the Protestant points of view; Mr Gladstone, though he approved of  the measure, retired from the Ministry, as he had a few years before  written in the opposite sense. Towards the close of the year the  condition of Ireland, owing to the failure of the potato crop, became  very alarming, and the Ministry greatly embarrassed. Lord John Russell  wrote from Edinburgh to the electors of the City of London, announcing  his conversion to the Repeal of the Corn Laws, and the _Times_  announced that such a Bill would be brought in by the Ministry. Peel,  reluctant to accept the task, resigned office in December, and a Whig  Ministry was attempted. Owing to dissensions, the attempt had to be  abandoned, and Peel returned to office, without Lord Stanley, but  with Mr Gladstone, who however did not seek re-election for the seat  vacated by his acceptance of office.    A dispute of great importance arose during the year with the United  States, relating to the boundary line between English and American  territory west of the Rocky Mountains. Twenty-five years earlier the  same question had arisen, and had been settled on the footing of joint  occupancy. The increased importance of the Pacific slope made the  matter more vital, involving as it did the ownership of Vancouver  Island and the mouth of the Columbia River; President Polk  unequivocally claimed the whole, and said he would not shrink from  upholding America's interests; the British Government was equally  firm, and the matter was not adjusted till 1846.    In India, which during nearly the whole year enjoyed peace, the Sikhs  in December assumed the aggressive, and crossed the Sutlej, invading  British India. They were signally defeated by Sir Hugh Gough at  Moodkee and Ferozeshah. In Scinde Sir Charles Napier prosecuted  operations against the mountain desert tribes.    In New Zealand some disastrous collisions took place between the  natives and the settlers; the former on two occasions either defeating  or repulsing the British arms.    In France the most important events were the Bill for fortifying  Paris, the campaign waged against Abd-el-Kader in Algeria, and  a horrible act of cruelty perpetrated there. In Spain Don Carlos  abdicated his claims to the throne in favour of his son; the Queen's  engagement to Count Trapani was rumoured. In other parts of Europe  little that was eventful occurred.          CHAPTER XIV    1845      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _14th January 1845._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--What you say about Aquila[1] and Montpensier  interests me. What madness is it then to force Trapani on Spain! Pray  explain to me the cause of the King's obstinacy about that Spanish  marriage, for _no_ country has a right to dictate in that way to  another. If Tatane[2] was _to think_ of the Infanta, England would be  extremely indignant, and would (and with right) consider it tantamount  to a marriage with the Queen herself. Ever your devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 1: Louis Charles, Comte d'Aquila, a son of Francis      I., King of the Two Sicilies, and brother of the Comte de      Trapani and of Queen Christina; he and his brother were      therefore uncles of Queen Isabella.]        [Footnote 2: The Duc de Montpensier.]          _The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._    LAEKEN, _18th January 1845._    MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--... The Spanish marriage question is really very  curious; in fact, all the other Bourbon branches are hostile to the  Orleans family, but the idea that makes the King so constant in his  views about it, is that he imagines it would create in France a bad  impression if _now_ any other than a Bourbon was to marry the Queen of  Spain. That feeling they have _themselves created_, as in France  they did not at all care about it; having, however, declared _quasi_  officially in the French Chambers that they _will not have any but  a Bourbon_, if circumstances should after all decide it otherwise it  would now be a defeat, but certainly one of their own making.... Your  devoted Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.          _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _28th January 1845._    ...The feeling of loyalty in this country is happily _very_ strong,  and wherever we show ourselves we are most heartily and warmly  received, and the civilities and respect shown to us by those we visit  is _most_ satisfactory. I mention merely a trifling instance to show  _how_ respectful they are--the Duke of Buckingham, who is immensely  proud, bringing the cup of coffee after dinner on a waiter to Albert  himself. And everywhere my dearest Angel receives the respect and  honours I receive.    Many thanks for returning the list;[3] it was not Albert but _Tatane_  who made the black crosses. Are not \"Les 3 Mousquetaires,\" by Dumas,  and \"Arthur,\" by Eugene Sue, _readable_ for _me_?    Now adieu, dearest, best Uncle. Ever your truly devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.
