This development has been reached by the time the young man  is twenty-one to twenty-three years of age, when, in the average case,  he would be able, so far as concerns his physique and temperament, to  establish and maintain a home. The fact that his adolescent  development is complete by the age of twenty-five, and that he has, by  the time he arrives at that age, grown into the full stature of all  his physical and mental powers, may certainly be interpreted as  nature's indication that his home-building should be begun not later  than the twenty-fifth year. This means, then, that young men ought, if  possible, to marry as young as twenty-five.    But the conditions of society at the present time are such that a  large proportion of the young men, particularly those who are  preparing for any of the learned professions (theology, medicine, law,  pedagogy, etc.) are hardly through their professional courses by the  time they reach that age, and most of them feel that they must make a  start in their profession before they assume the responsibilities of  supporting a home. This means that a large proportion of them marry as  late as thirty years of age.    If we consider now those commercial, financial and industrial  vocations which involve considerable preparation in technical  institutions or a long apprenticeship (engineering, pharmacy,  manufacturing chemists, banking, journalism, etc., etc.) we find that  the young man is hardly able to establish such a home as most such  young men feel that they must maintain on any salary that they receive  before they are twenty-eight to thirty years old. This consideration  applies particularly to college and university men, as, almost without  exception, these men are preparing for some of the above mentioned  professions or vocations.    Now the conditions of college life, the field sports and athletics,  together with the social conditions, tend to develop in college  circles a body of most virile young men. The problem which now  confronts us is: How may these young men live a hygienic life under  these unnatural circumstances?    If a man becomes able to procreate his kind at seventeen but is hardly  able to marry before he is thirty he must solve the problem as to what  his attitude shall be regarding matters of sex. The earlier this  problem is solved the better it is for the young man. Unfortunately, a  large proportion of young men do not realize that they have any  problem in this field to solve until circumstances, more or less  accidental, have already established in them a mental attitude and,  perhaps, a habit of life that may not be either wholesome or wise.    From what has preceded, it must be evident that from the early months  of the period of puberty, through the adolescent and adult period,  even until some progress is made in the senile period, every normal  male will experience sexual desires. It has been shown that these  particular experiences are linked, more or less intimately, with the  condition of the sexual apparatus; but whatever the cause, we are  confronted with the question, What shall be done about it?    When a man experiences a sexual desire does it necessarily follow that  the desire must be satisfied? Some have reasoned that the muscles of  the arm, if not exercised, wither and become weak, therefore the  sexual desires, if not exercised will become weak, and the sexual  apparatus, if it does not exercise its function, must become withered  and atrophied. While this course of reasoning may seem rational and  the conclusion may seem tenable, it is well known to physiologists and  sociologists that the reasoning is fallacious; the fallacy rests in  the premises. It was assumed above that the activity of the sexual  glands was comparable with that of muscles.    We must not lose sight of the fact that the male sexual glands are  continuously active, and in this continuous activity get their  exercise. This activity develops them and keeps them physically  perfect after the onset of the period of puberty. Their activity  consists very largely in the formation of an internal secretion, the  office of which is to develop in the male the highest possible state  of virility. Nor must we lose sight of the fact that every procreative  act is performed at a sacrifice of some of this vital fluid on the  part of the male. A wanton sacrifice of vital fluid either in the act  of self abuse or in excessive venery is not justifiable under any  consideration; nor may these acts, under any circumstances, be looked  upon as sustaining to the gland a relation similar to that which  muscular exercise sustains to muscle tissue.    In the light of these facts every normal man would admit that  frequent masturbation or excessive sexual intercourse, in wedlock or  out, should certainly not be recommended as a method of developing the  sexual apparatus.    Most men, however, raise the question: \"Is any indulgence or any  artificial means for satisfying the sexual inclination to be  discouraged?\" This inclination comes to us in the course of nature.  Man in the primitive state would seek a mate as soon as he felt this  inclination; would fight for the possession of her as soon as he had  reached a sufficient stage of muscular development, and once in  possession of his mate, would take her to his perch in the trees or to  his cave. In his primitive home he would follow his sexual  inclination, impregnate his wife and protect her against all dangers.    Under our present social conditions the young man experiences all  these desires the same as his primitive ancestor, but he may not be  able to choose a mate and begin with her the building of a home for a  whole decade after he experiences the desire to do so. What is the  solution?    It must be evident that the solution lies in the acceptance of one or  another of three alternatives--either the young man may seek illicit  intercourse with women to satisfy his sexual desire, or he may adopt  some artificial measure, such as masturbation (self abuse) or,  finally, he may lead what is known as a continent life. By continence  we mean to adopt neither one of the first two alternatives mentioned,  but to leave the care of the sexual apparatus wholly with Nature.    We may now consider these three alternatives in turn.      1. ILLICIT INTERCOURSE WITH WOMEN.    By illicit intercourse with women we mean, sexual intercourse out of  wedlock. The term applies either to intercourse between any man and a  prostitute, between an unmarried man and a married woman, between an  unmarried man and an unmarried woman or between a married man and a  married woman not his wife. The term, illicit intercourse, applies to  all sexual intercourse that is illegal.    In our discussion of the young man's problem, we may confine our  consideration particularly to intercourse with professional  prostitutes and with clandestines, or women who are willing to accept  the sexual embrace for their own gratification or for money.    In this phase of sexual gratification, it is assumed that the woman  has these relations with various men. We purposely eliminate from this  discussion the deliberate seduction of pure girls for the purpose of  sexual gratification, as such seduction is a heinous offense against  the victim and against society, for which offense the man is legally  responsible. We are here discussing not the crimes of men, but their  vices.    The question that the young man naturally asks is--\"Why should society  hold these relations as a vice when the woman, who is party to the  act, gives her free consent, perhaps even soliciting the relation, and  has given herself up to this sort of a life, either as a sole  occupation (prostitute) or as an auxiliary occupation (clandestine) to  supplement a wage on which she may not be able to live in luxury?\"    The answer to this question is not far to seek. Women so occupied  have, as a rule, made themselves incapable of maternity. They are  outcasts from society, unfortunately exerting a most harmful influence  on all those who come into relation with them. Furthermore, they are  centers for the dissemination of venereal diseases which wreck the  health of all those who become infected. But for the uncontrolled  passions of men, there would be no such women. So while we,  individually, as men, may not be responsible for the ruin of any one  woman, we must confess that men as a class are responsible for this  condition of prostitution and clandestine intercourse. An overwhelming  majority of women would, if following their inclinations, seek these  relations in wedlock only and for procreation only. But many a young  woman, under promise of marriage, sometimes even under a bogus  marriage, is brought into a condition of hypnotism or into a mental  state that puts her in the power of the man whom she loves and  respects. If he deceives her and betrays her, continuing such betrayal  until the victim becomes pregnant, he will, in the average case, leave  her to bear her child in shame, while he slips away to other scenes of  activity. We cannot wonder then, that the girl--deserted, humiliated,  crushed by the one in whom she reposed absolute confidence; cast out  of society, perhaps thrust from the protection of her own father's  roof--gives up the struggle and says--\"_What's the use?_\"    A vast majority of such poor girls make their way to houses of ill  fame and give themselves over to a life of prostitution. Hardly one of  these women, if married by the man who brought her to this condition,  would have failed to make a true and loving wife and mother. So  society, while it casts these women out, has come to recognize that  men are the real sinners in such cases.

She  had once been the mother of three beautiful daughters, the very  loveliest maidens in all the country round. They were so handsome that  they attracted the attention of the wicked fairy who lived in an  enchanted castle nearby, and this fairy had been very jealous of them.  By the aid of magic she tied them up in sacks which could be opened  only by burning the sacks over a fire built from magic wood. The  little old woman and her little black son searched long and diligently  for magic wood, but they were never able to find any.    It was a terrible thing to have one's daughters shut up in magic  sacks. The little old woman had grown bent and weak and cross in her  search to find the magic wood. If it had not been for the little  black boy she would have given up entirely. The little black boy was  always gay and cheerful and always sure that some day they would  succeed in finding the magic wood.    One day the little old woman took her big water jar upon her head and  carried it down to the stream to fill. It was so very heavy when she  had filled it with water that she could not lift it to her head even  with the help of the little black boy. Three fine looking  _cavalheiros_ happened to be passing on horseback. She sent the little  black boy to ask them if they would help her. They said they couldn't  possibly stop. The little old woman was very angry. She did not know  that they were on their way to the magic castle and _couldn't_ stop.  The same wicked fairy who had shut the little old woman's beautiful  daughters up in the sacks, was leading them on.    If the little old woman had known all about the three _cavalheiros_  she would not have been angry. She would have wanted to help them  instead. The three _cavalheiros_ were very good and very wise, so they  managed to get along very well. As soon as they reached the enchanted  castle the fairy showed them to their beds. She had marked each bed  with a candle. No one before had ever been wise enough to blow out  these candles. These _cavalheiros_ blew out the candles and that took  away the fairy's power over them. They were able to escape from the  palace. When the wicked fairy came to put them in her magic sacks she  found the beds empty.    The three _cavalheiros_ took their horses and rode back by the same  road by which they had come. They stopped at a little shop on a corner  which was kept by a good fairy and bought one _vintem's_ worth of  ashes, one _vintem's_ worth of salt and one _vintem's_ worth of pins.    After a while the three _cavalheiros_ approached the house of the  little old woman and the little black boy. The little old woman was  still angry because they had refused to stop and help her lift her  water jar to her head. When she saw them coming she threw stones at  them. Of course that was a very stupid thing to do.    When the three _cavalheiros_ saw what was happening they were greatly  surprised. They had forgotten all about the little black boy and the  little old woman whom he had asked them to help. When they saw her  coming with the stones they thought that she must be a wicked fairy in  the form of a little old woman.    The _cavalheiro_ who had one _vintem's_ worth of ashes in his pocket  threw the ashes at her. It became night. The little old woman came on  with her stones just the same.    The _cavalheiro_ who had one _vintem's_ worth of salt in his pocket  threw the salt at her. Immediately a sea of salt water appeared  between the three _cavalheiros_ and the little old woman. The little  old woman came on with her stones just the same.    The _cavalheiro_ who had one _vintem's_ worth of pins in his pocket  threw the pins at her. Immediately a high, thorny hedge sprang out of  the ground between the little old woman and the three _cavalheiros_.    The little old woman was too angry to think clearly. If she had not  been so angry she would have known at once that this must be magic  wood. The little black boy, however, had his wits about him. He  hastened to gather the branches even though the thorns tore his hands.  Soon he had brought together a great pile of wood like the piles which  they make in the streets to burn on a _festa_ night.    The little old woman saw what he was doing and ran to get the magic  sacks in which her daughters were imprisoned. They laid the sacks on  top of the pile of magic wood and lighted the fire. There was a great  noise like thunder. Out of the three magic sacks there sprang three  beautiful maidens who had been preserved alive in the sacks by a  miracle of _Nossa Senhora_.    The little old woman and her three beautiful daughters turned to thank  the little black boy for what he had done. The little black boy was no  longer black. He had been turned white.    The three _cavalheiros_ married the three beautiful maidens and the  little boy who was now white, grew up to be the greatest _cavalheiro_  of them all.          XVI    How the Pigeon Became a    Tame Bird      Once upon a time there was a father with three sons who had reached  the age when they must go out into the world to earn their own living.  When the time for parting came he gave to each of them a large melon  with the advice that they open the melons only at a place where there  was water nearby.    The three brothers set out from their father's house, each taking a  different path. As soon as the eldest son was out of sight of the  house he opened his melon. A beautiful maiden sprang out of the melon  saying, \"Give me water or give me milk.\" There was no water nearby and  neither did the young man have any milk to give her. She fell down  dead.    The second son left his father's house by a path which led over a  steep hill. The large melon was heavy to carry and in a little while  he became very tired and thirsty. He saw no water nearby and feared  that there was no possibility of finding any soon, so he thought he  would open the melon and use it to quench his thirst. Accordingly he  opened his melon. To his great surprise, a beautiful maiden sprang  forth saying, \"Give me water or give me milk.\" Of course he had  neither to give her and she fell down dead.    The third son also travelled by a path which led over a steep hill.  He, too, became very tired and thirsty and he often thought how much  he would like to open his melon. However, he remembered his father's  advice to open it only where there was water nearby. So he travelled  on and on hoping to find a spring of water on the hillside. He did not  have the good fortune to pass near a spring either going up the hill  or coming down on the opposite side. At the foot of the hill there was  a town and in the centre of the town there was a fountain. The young  man hurried straight to the fountain and took a long refreshing drink.  Then he opened his melon. A beautiful maiden sprang forth saying,  \"Give me water or give me milk.\" The young man gave her a drink of  water. Then he helped her to a hiding place among the thick branches  of the tree which grew beside the fountain and went away in search of  food.    Soon a little black servant girl came to the fountain to fill a big  water jar which she carried on her head. The maiden in the tree above  the fountain peeped out through the branches. When the little black  servant girl bent over the water to fill her jar she saw the  reflection of a charming face in the water. \"How beautiful I have  become,\" she said to herself. \"How ridiculous that any one as  beautiful as I am should carry water on her head.\" She threw her water  jar upon the ground in disdain and it broke into a thousand pieces.    When the little maid reached home with neither water nor water jar her  mistress punished her severely and sent her again to the fountain  with a new water jar to fill. This time the maiden in the tree gave a  little silvery laugh when the black servant girl bent over the water.  The little maid looked up and spied her in the tree. \"O, it is you, is  it, who are responsible for my beating?\" she said. She pulled a pin  out of her camisa and, reaching up, she stuck it savagely into the  beautiful maiden in the tree. Then a strange thing happened. There was  no longer any beautiful maiden in the tree. There was just a pigeon  there.    At that moment the young man came back to the tree with the food he  had procured. When the little black maid heard his footsteps she was  frightened nearly to death. She hid herself quickly among the thick  branches of the tree. The young man was very much surprised to find a  little black maid in the tree in the place of the beautiful maiden he  had left there. \"What has happened to you during my absence\" he asked  in horror as soon as he saw her. \"The sun has burned my complexion.  That is all. It is nothing. I shall be myself again when I get away  from this hot place,\" the little maid replied.    The young man married the little black maid and took her away out of  sunny places hoping that she would soon be again the beautiful maiden  she was when he left her by the fountain in search of food. But she  always remained black.    Years passed and the young man became very rich. He lived in a  beautiful mansion. All around the house there was a wonderful garden  full of lovely flowers and splendid trees where birds loved to sing  sweet songs and build their nests. In spite of his beautiful home the  young man was not very happy. It was a great trial to have a wife who  was so black. He often walked up and down the paths in his garden at  the close of the day and thought about how beautiful his wife had been  the first time he ever saw her. As he walked in the garden there was  always a pigeon which followed him about. It flew about his head in a  way that annoyed him, so one day when his wife was sick and asked for  a pigeon to be roasted for her dinner he commanded that this  particular pigeon should be killed.
