Connect it to a gas supply by light flexible tubing, and turn down the  gas till the flame from the end of the jet is not more than one-tenth  of an inch long.  Then apply the jet, beginning from the end of the  crack, and gradually draw it (the crack) round the tube.  The  operation will be assisted if a rubber ring is slipped on the tube to  begin with, so that the eye has some guide as to whether the flame is  being drawn round properly or not.  The ring must, of course, be far  enough away to escape the effect of the flame.  The crack will be  found to follow the flame in the most docile manner, unless the tube  is thick or badly annealed.  Some operators recommend a pencil of  glowing charcoal, but the flame is undoubtedly better.    Sec. 30.  To cut very thick Tubes.    A large number of methods have been proposed, and nearly everybody has  his favourite.  The following has always succeeded with me.  First  mark on the tube, by means of a little dead black spirit paint,  exactly where the cut is to be.  Then sharpen the glass knife and  scratch a quite deep cut all round:  there is no difficulty in making  the cut one-twentieth of an inch deep.  It will be proper to lubricate  the knife with kerosene after the first mark is made.  [Footnote: The  edge of the knife may be advantageously saved by using an old file  moistened with kerosene for the purpose.  I find kerosene is not  worse, but, if anything, better than the solution of camphor in  turpentine recommended by Mr. Shenstone.]    If the glass is about one-eighth of an inch thick, the scratch maybe  conveniently about one-twentieth of an inch deep, but if the glass is  anything like one-quarter of an inch thick, the scratch must be much  deeper, in fact, the glass may be half cut through.  To make a very  deep scratch, a wheel armed with diamond dust, which will be described  later on, may be used.  However, it is not essential to use a diamond  wheel, though it saves time.    When the cut is made to a sufficient depth proceed thus:  Obtain two  strips of bibulous paper or bits of tape and twist them round the tube  on each side of the scratch, allowing not more than one-eighth of an  inch between them. Then add a few drops of water to each, till it is  thoroughly soaked, but not allowing water to run away.  Dry out the  scratch by a shred of blotting paper.    Turn down the oxygas flame to the smallest dimensions, and then boldly  apply it with its hottest part playing right into the nick and at a  single point.  Probably in about two seconds, or less, the tube will  break.  If it does not, rotate the tube, but still so that the flame  plays in the nick.  After making the tube very hot all round--if it  has not broken--apply the flame again steadily at one point for a few  seconds and then apply a bit of cold iron.  If the tube does not break  at once during these processes, let it cool, and cut the groove  deeper;  then try again. [Footnote: This method is continually being  reinvented and published in the various journals.  It is of unknown  antiquity.]    Fig. 22.    If the tube breaks after great heating and long efforts, it will  probably leave incipient cracks running away from the break, or may  even break irregularly.  A good break is nearly always one that was  easily made.  If a number of rings have to be cut, or a number of cuts  made on glass tubes of about the same size, it will be found  economical in the end to mount a glazier's diamond for the purpose.  A  simple but suitable apparatus is figured (Fig.  23).    Fig.  23.    The only difficulty is to regulate the position of the diamond so that  it cuts.  In order to do this, carefully note its cutting angle by  preliminary trials on sheet glass, and then adjust the diamond by  clamps, or by wriggling it in a fork, as shown.  Weight the board very  slightly, so as to give the small necessary pressure, and produce the  cut by rotating the tube by hand.  When a cut is nearly completed take  great care that the two ends join, or irregularity will result.  This  is not always easy to do unless the tube happens to be straight.  Having got a cut, start a crack by means of a fine light watchmaker's  hammer, or even a bit of fused glass, and entice the crack round the  cut by tapping with the hammer or by means of the flame pencil.    If the cut is a true \"cut\" the tube will break at once.  As a supply  of electrical current for lighting will, in the near future, be as  much a matter of course for laboratory purposes as a gas supply, I add  the following note.  To heat a tube round a scratch, nothing--not  even the oxygas blow-pipe--is so good as a bit of platinum or iron  wire electrically heated.  If the crack does not start by considerable  heating of the glass, stop the current, unwind the wire, and touch the  glass on the crack either with a bit of cold copper wire or a wet  match stem. I prefer the copper wire, for in my experience the water  will occasionally produce an explosion of cracks.  On the other hand,  the cold wire frequently fails to start a crack.    Judging from the appearance of thick tubes as supplied by the dealers,  the factory method of cutting off appears to be to grind a nick almost  through the tube, and right round;  and for really thick glass this is  the safest but slowest way;  a thin emery wheel kept wet will do this  perfectly.  Suitable wheels may be purchased from the \"Norton\" Emery  Wheel Co.  of Bedford, Mass, U.S.A.--in England through Messrs.  Churchill and Co.  of London, importers.    Sec. 31.  To blow a Bulb at the End of a Tube.    I must admit at once that this is a difficult operation--at all  events, if a large bulb is required.  However, all there is to be said  can be said in few words.  In general, when a bulb is required at the  end of a tube it will be necessary to thicken up the glass.  A  professional glass-worker will generally accomplish this by \"jumping  up\" the tube, i.e.  by heating it where the bulb is required, and  compressing it little by little until a sufficient amount of glass is  collected.  The amateur will probably find that he gets a very  irregular mass in this way, and will be tempted to begin by welding on  a short bit of wide and thick tubing preparatory to blowing out the  bulb.    However, supposing that enough glass is assembled by-either of these  methods, and that it is quite uniform in thickness, let the thickened  part be heated along a circle till it becomes moderately soft, and let  it then be expanded about one-fifth, say by gently blowing.  It is  perhaps more important to keep turning the glass during bulb-blowing  than in any other operation, and this both when the glass is in the  flame and while the bulb is being blown.  It is also very important to  avoid draughts.  In general, a bulb is best blown with the tube in a  nearly horizontal position, but sloping slightly upwards from the  mouth.  If it be noticed that a bulb tends to blow out more at one  side than another, let the side of greatest protuberance be turned  down, so that it is at the lowest point, reduce the pressure for an  instant, and then blow again.  It will be observed that the bulb will  now expand at the top.    The reason of this is chiefly that the under side cools most rapidly  (according to Faraday, Chemical Manipulation, Sec. 1194), and  consequently can expand no further;  but also it is not unlikely that  the glass tends to flow somewhat from the upper side, which remains  hot, and consequently the bulb, when the next puff reaches it, will  tend to yield at this point.  By heating several zones the tube will  become gradually expanded.    Fig. 24.    Fig.  25.    Fig. 26.    When the length of the thickened part of the tube only slightly  exceeds its diameter (Fig.  25), let the whole be brought to a  temperature which, with flint glass, should be just short of that of  perfect fluidity;  and then, holding the tube horizontally and  constantly turning it, let the bulb be blown out to its full size,  noting the appearances and correcting too great protuberance on any  side by the means above mentioned.  If the bulb appears pear-shaped  turn the tube so that the melted mass is directed upwards;  if the  bulb have the contrary fault, correct in the corresponding manner.    The bulb when finished may be lightly tapped on the table, when, if  there is any weak place owing to inequality of thickness, the bulb  will break, and the operation may be started afresh.  \"A good bulb is  round, set truly on the tube, and free from lumps of thick glass or  places of excessive thinness.\"  When the amateur has succeeded in  blowing a bulb two inches in diameter on the end of a strong bit of  thermometer tube--say for an air thermometer--he may well seek the  congratulations of his friends.    In case the bulb is not satisfactory on a first attempt, it may be  melted down again, if the following precautions are taken.  Directly  creases begin to appear in the bulb let it be withdrawn from the  flame, and gently blown till the creases come out.  By alternate  heating and blowing the glass can be got back to its original form, or  nearly so, but unless the operator shows great skill and judgment, the  probability is that the glass will be uneven.  By heating and keeping  the thicker parts in the higher position, and blowing a little now and  again, the glass may be got even, and a new attempt may be made.  It  must not be supposed that this process can be carried on indefinitely,  for the glass tends to lose its viscous properties after a time, or,  at all events, it \"perishes\" in some way, especially if it has been  allowed to get very thin;  consequently too frequent attempts on the  same glass are unprofitable.  Two or three trials are as many as it  generally pays to make.  As a rule the largest possible flame may be  used with advantage in this operation.    Sec. 32.
