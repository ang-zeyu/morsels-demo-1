[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],[0,"Anarchism and Other Essays (#9)"],[1,"as religion,  \"Sacrifice! Abnegate! Submit!\"  The spirit of Anarchism has lifted  man from his prostrate position.  He now stands erect, with his face  toward the light.  He has learned to see the insatiable, devouring,  devastating nature of property, and he is preparing to strike the  monster dead.    \"Property is robbery,\" said the great French Anarchist, Proudhon.  Yes, but without risk and danger to the robber.  Monopolizing the  accumulated efforts of man, property has robbed him of his  birthright, and has turned him loose a pauper and an outcast.  Property has not even the time-worn excuse that man does not create  enough to satisfy all needs.  The A B C student of economics knows  that the productivity of labor within the last few decades far  exceeds normal demand a hundredfold.  But what are normal demands to  an abnormal institution?  The only demand that property recognizes is  its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means  power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to  enslave, to outrage, to degrade.  America is particularly boastful of  her great power, her enormous national wealth.  Poor America, of what  avail is all her wealth, if the individuals comprising the nation are  wretchedly poor?  If they live in squalor, in filth, in crime, with  hope and joy gone, a homeless, soilless army of human prey.    It is generally conceded that unless the returns of any business  venture exceed the cost, bankruptcy is inevitable.  But those engaged  in the business of producing wealth have not yet learned even this  simple lesson.  Every year the cost of production in human life is  growing larger (50,000 killed, 100,000 wounded in America last year);  the returns to the masses, who help to create wealth, are ever  getting smaller.  Yet America continues to be blind to the inevitable  bankruptcy of our business of production.  Nor is this the only crime  of the latter.  Still more fatal is the crime of turning the producer  into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than  his master of steel and iron.  Man is being robbed not merely of the  products of his labor, but of the power of free initiative, of  originality, and the interest in, or desire for, the things he is  making.    Real wealth consists in things of utility and beauty, in things that  help to create strong, beautiful bodies and surroundings inspiring to  live in.  But if man is doomed to wind cotton around a spool, or dig  coal, or build roads for thirty years of his life, there can be no  talk of wealth.  What he gives to the world is only gray and hideous  things, reflecting a dull and hideous existence,--too weak to live,  too cowardly to die.  Strange to say, there are people who extol this  deadening method of centralized production as the proudest  achievement of our age.  They fail utterly to realize that if we are  to continue in machine subserviency, our slavery is more complete  than was our bondage to the King.  They do not want to know that  centralization is not only the death-knell of liberty, but also of  health and beauty, of art and science, all these being impossible in  a clock-like, mechanical atmosphere.    Anarchism cannot but repudiate such a method of production: its goal  is the freest possible expression of all the latent powers of the  individual.  Oscar Wilde defines a perfect personality as \"one who  develops under perfect conditions, who is not wounded, maimed, or in  danger.\"  A perfect personality, then, is only possible in a state of  society where man is free to choose the mode of work, the conditions  of work, and the freedom to work.  One to whom the making of a table,  the building of a house, or the tilling of the soil, is what the  painting is to the artist and the discovery to the scientist,--the  result of inspiration, of intense longing, and deep interest in work  as a creative force.  That being the ideal of Anarchism, its economic  arrangements must consist of voluntary productive and distributive  associations, gradually developing into free communism, as the best  means of producing with the least waste of human energy.  Anarchism,  however, also recognizes the right of the individual, or numbers of  individuals, to arrange at all times for other forms of work, in  harmony with their tastes and desires.    Such free display of human energy being possible only under complete  individual and social freedom, Anarchism directs its forces against  the third and greatest foe of all social equality; namely, the State,  organized authority, or statutory law,--the dominion of human  conduct.    Just as religion has fettered the human mind, and as property, or the  monopoly of things, has subdued and stifled man's needs, so has the  State enslaved his spirit, dictating every phase of conduct.  \"All  government in essence,\" says Emerson, \"is tyranny.\"  It matters not  whether it is government by divine right or majority rule.  In every  instance its aim is the absolute subordination of the individual.    Referring to the American government, the greatest American  Anarchist, David Thoreau, said: \"Government, what is it but a  tradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself  unimpaired to posterity, but each instance losing its integrity; it  has not the vitality and force of a single living man.  Law never  made man a whit more just; and by means of their respect for it, even  the well disposed are daily made agents of injustice.\"    Indeed, the keynote of government is injustice.  With the arrogance  and self-sufficiency of the King who could do no wrong, governments  ordain, judge, condemn, and punish the most insignificant offenses,  while maintaining themselves by the greatest of all offenses, the  annihilation of individual liberty.  Thus Ouida is right when she  maintains that \"the State only aims at instilling those qualities in  its public by which its demands are obeyed, and its exchequer is  filled.  Its highest attainment is the reduction of mankind to  clockwork.  In its atmosphere all those finer and more delicate  liberties, which require treatment and spacious expansion, inevitably  dry up and perish.  The State requires a taxpaying machine in which  there is no hitch, an exchequer in which there is never a deficit,  and a public, monotonous, obedient, colorless, spiritless, moving  humbly like a flock of sheep along a straight high road between two  walls.\"    Yet even a flock of sheep would resist the chicanery of the State, if  it were not for the corruptive, tyrannical, and oppressive methods it  employs to serve its purposes.  Therefore Bakunin repudiates the  State as synonymous with the surrender of the liberty of the  individual or small minorities,--the destruction of social  relationship, the curtailment, or complete denial even, of life  itself, for its own aggrandizement.  The State is the altar of  political freedom and, like the religious altar, it is maintained for  the purpose of human sacrifice.    In fact, there is hardly a modern thinker who does not agree that  government, organized authority, or the State, is necessary ONLY to  maintain or protect property and monopoly.  It has proven efficient  in that function only.    Even George Bernard Shaw, who hopes for the miraculous from the State  under Fabianism, nevertheless admits that \"it is at present a huge  machine for robbing and slave-driving of the poor by brute force.\"  This being the case, it is hard to see why the clever prefacer wishes  to uphold the State after poverty shall have ceased to exist.    Unfortunately there are still a number of people who continue in the  fatal belief that government rests on natural laws, that it maintains  social order and harmony, that it diminishes crime, and that it  prevents the lazy man from fleecing his fellows.  I shall therefore  examine these contentions.    A natural law is that factor in man which asserts itself freely and  spontaneously without any external force, in harmony with the  requirements of nature.  For instance, the demand for nutrition, for  sex gratification, for light, air, and exercise, is a natural law.  But its expression needs not the machinery of government, needs not  the club, the gun, the handcuff, or the prison.  To obey such laws,  if we may call it obedience, requires only spontaneity and free  opportunity.  That governments do not maintain themselves through  such harmonious factors is proven by the terrible array of violence,  force, and coercion all governments use in order to live.  Thus  Blackstone is right when he says, \"Human laws are invalid, because  they are contrary to the laws of nature.\"    Unless it be the order of Warsaw after the slaughter of thousands of  people, it is difficult to ascribe to governments any capacity for  order or social harmony.  Order derived through submission and  maintained by terror is not much of a safe guaranty; yet that is the  only \"order\" that governments have ever maintained.  True social  harmony grows naturally out of solidarity of interests.  In a society  where those who always work never have anything, while those who  never work enjoy everything, solidarity of interests is non-existent;  hence social harmony is but a myth.  The only way organized authority  meets this grave situation is by extending still greater privileges  to those who have already monopolized the earth, and by still further  enslaving the disinherited masses.  Thus the entire arsenal of  government--laws, police, soldiers, the courts, legislatures,  prisons,--is strenuously engaged in \"harmonizing\" the most  antagonistic elements in society.    The most absurd apology for authority and law is that they serve to  diminish crime.  Aside from the fact that the State is itself the  greatest criminal, breaking every written and natural law, stealing  in the form of taxes, killing in the form of war and capital  punishment, it has come to an absolute"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],[0,"Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#9)"],[1,"  is necessary here to speak of the secular copyists, who were an important  class during the middle ages, and supplied the functions of the  bibliopole of the ancients. But the transcribing trade numbered three or  four distinct branches. There were the Librarii Antiquarii, Notarii, and  the Illuminators--occasionally these professions were all united in  one--where perseverance or talent had acquired a knowledge of these  various arts. There appears to have been considerable competition between  these contending bodies. The notarii were jealous of the librarii, and  the librarii in their turn were envious of the antiquarii, who devoted  their ingenuity to the transcription and repairing of old books  especially, rewriting such parts as were defective or erased, and  restoring the dilapidations of the binding. Being learned in old writings  they corrected and revised the copies of ancient codices; of this class  we find mention as far back as the time of Cassiodorus and Isidore.[57]  \"They deprived,\" says Astle, \"the poor librarii, or common scriptores, of  great part of their business, so that they found it difficult to gain a  subsistence for themselves and their families. This put them about  finding out more expeditious methods of transcribing books. They formed  the letters smaller, and made use of more conjugations and abbreviations  than had been usual. They proceeded in this manner till the letters  became exceedingly small and extremely difficult to be read.\"[58] The  fact of there existing a class of men, whose fixed employment or  profession was solely confined to the transcription of ancient writings  and to the repairing of tattered copies, in contradistinction to the  common scribes, and depending entirely upon the exercise of their art as  a means of obtaining a subsistence, leads us to the conclusion that  ancient manuscripts were by no means so very scarce in those days; for  how absurd and useless it would have been for men to qualify themselves  for transcribing these antiquated and venerable codices, if there had  been no probability of obtaining them to transcribe. The fact too of its  becoming the subject of so much competition proves how great was the  demand for their labor.[59]    We are unable, with any positive result, to discover the exact origin of  the secular scribes, though their existence may probably be referred to a  very remote period. The monks seem to have monopolized for some ages the  \"_Commercium Librorum_,\"[60] and sold and bartered copies to a  considerable extent among each other. We may with some reasonable  grounds, however, conjecture that the profession was flourishing in Saxon  times; for we find several eminent names in the seventh and eighth  centuries who, in their epistolary correspondence, beg their friends to  procure transcripts for them. Benedict, Bishop of Wearmouth, purchased  most of his book treasures at Rome, which was even at that early period  probably a famous mart for such luxuries, as he appears to have journeyed  there for that express purpose. Some of the books which he collected were  presents from his foreign friends; but most of them, as Bede tells us,  were _bought_ by himself, or in accordance with his instructions, by his  friends.[61] Boniface, the Saxon missionary, continually writes for books  to his associates in all parts of Europe. At a subsequent period the  extent and importance of the profession grew amazingly; and in Italy its  followers were particularly numerous in the tenth century, as we learn  from the letters of Gerbert, afterwards Silvester II., who constantly  writes, with the cravings of a bibliomaniac, to his friends for books,  and begs them to get the scribes, who, he adds, in one of his letters,  may be found in all parts of Italy,[62] both in town and in the country,  to make transcripts of certain books for him, and he promises to  reimburse his correspondent all that he expends for the same.    These public scribes derived their principal employment from the monks  and the lawyers; from the former in transcribing their manuscripts, and  by the latter in drawing up their legal instruments. They carried on  their avocation at their own homes like other artisans; but sometimes  when employed by the monks executed their transcripts within the  cloister, where they were boarded, lodged, and received their wages till  their work was done. This was especially the case when some great book  was to be copied, of rarity and price; thus we read of Paulinus, of St.  Albans, sending into distant parts to obtain proficient workmen, who were  paid so much per diem for their labor; their wages were generously  supplied by the Lord of Redburn.[63]    The increase of knowledge and the foundation of the universities gave  birth to the booksellers. Their occupation as a distinct trade originated  at a period coeval with the foundation of these public seminaries,  although the first mention that I am aware of is made by Peter of Blois,  about the year 1170. I shall have occasion to speak more hereafter of  this celebrated scholar, but I may be excused for giving the anecdote  here, as it is so applicable to my subject. It appears, then, that whilst  remaining in Paris to transact some important matter for the King of  England, he entered the shop of \"a public dealer in books\"--for be it  known that the archdeacon was always on the search, and seldom missed an  opportunity of adding to his library--the bookseller, Peter tells us,  offered him a tempting collection on Jurisprudence; but although his  knowledge of such matters was so great that he did not require them for  his own use, he thought they might be serviceable to his nephew, and  after bargaining a little about the price he counted down the money  agreed upon and left the stall; but no sooner was his back turned than  the Provost of Sexeburgh came in to look over the literary stores of the  stationer, and his eye meeting the recently sold volume, he became  inspired with a wish to possess it; nor could he, on hearing it was  bought and paid for by another, suppress his anxiety to obtain the  treasure; but, offering more money, actually took the volume away by  force. As may be supposed, Archdeacon Peter was sorely annoyed at this  behavior; and \"To his dearest companion and friend Master Arnold of  Blois, Peter of Blois Archdeacon of Bath sent greeting,\" a long and  learned letter, displaying his great knowledge of civil law, and  maintaining the illegality of the provost's conduct.[64] The casual way  in which this is mentioned make it evident that the \"_publico mangone  Librorum_\" was no unusual personage in those days, but belonged to a  common and recognized profession.    The vast number of students who, by the foundation of universities, were  congregated together, generated of course a proportionate demand for  books, which necessity or luxury prompted them eagerly to purchase: but  there were poor as well as rich students educated in these great  seminaries of learning, whose pecuniary means debarred them from the  acquisition of such costly luxuries; and for this and other cogent  reasons the universities deemed it advantageous, and perhaps expedient,  to frame a code of laws and regulations to provide alike for the literary  wants of all classes and degrees. To effect this they obtained royal  sanction to take the trade entirely under their protection, and  eventually monopolized a sole legislative power over the _Librarii_.    In the college of Navarre a great quantity of ancient documents are  preserved, many of which relate to this curious subject. They were  deposited there by M. Jean Aubert in 1623, accompanied by an inventory of  them, divided into four parts by the first four letters of the alphabet.  In the fourth, under D. 18, there is a chapter entitled \"Des Libraires  Appretiateurs, Jurez et Enlumineurs,\" which contains much interesting  matter relating to the early history of bookselling.[65] These ancient  statutes, collected and printed by the University in the year 1652,[66]  made at various times, and ranging between the years 1275 and 1403, give  us a clear insight into the matter.    The nature of a bookseller's business in those days required no ordinary  capacity, and no shallow store of critical acumen; the purchasing of  manuscripts, the work of transcription, the careful revisal, the  preparation of materials, the tasteful illuminations, and the process of  binding, were each employments requiring some talent and discrimination,  and we are not surprised, therefore, that the avocation of a dealer and  fabricator of these treasures should be highly regarded, and dignified  into a profession, whose followers were invested with all the privileges,  freedoms and exemptions, which the masters and students of the university  enjoyed.[67] But it required these conciliations to render the  restrictive and somewhat severe measures, which she imposed on the  bookselling trade, to be received with any degree of favor or submission.  For whilst the University of Paris, by whom these statutes were framed,  encouraged and elevated the profession of the librarii, she required, on  the other hand, a guarantee of their wealth and mental capacity, to  maintain and to appreciate these important concessions; the bookseller  was expected indeed to be well versed in all branches of science, and to  be thoroughly imbued with a knowledge of those subjects and works of  which he undertook to produce transcripts.[68] She moreover required of  him testimonials to his good character, and efficient security, ratified  by a solemn oath of allegiance,[69] and a promise to observe and submit  to all the present and future laws and regulations of the university. In  some cases, it appears that she restricted the number of librarii, though  this fell into disuse as the wants of the students increased. Twenty-four  seems to have been the original number,[70] which is"]]]
