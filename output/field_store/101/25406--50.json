And various workmen send and call,  Who frame the door and build the wall:  With men of every art and trade,  Who read the stars and ply the spade,  And mimes and minstrels hither bring,  And damsels trained to dance and sing.\"    Then to the learned men he said,  In many a page of Scripture read:  \"Be yours each rite performed to see  According to the king's decree.  And stranger Brahmans quickly call  To this great rite that welcomes all.  Pavilions for the princes, decked  With art and ornament, erect,  And handsome booths by thousands made  The Brahman visitors to shade,  Arranged in order side by side,  With meat and drink and all supplied.  And ample stables we shall need  For many an elephant and steed:  And chambers where the men may lie,  And vast apartments, broad and high,  Fit to receive the countless bands  Of warriors come from distant lands.  For our own people too provide  Sufficient tents, extended wide,  And stores of meat and drink prepare,  And all that can be needed there.  And food in plenty must be found  For guests from all the country round.  Of various viands presents make,  For honour, not for pity's sake,  That fit regard and worship be  Paid to each caste in due degree.  And let not wish or wrath excite  Your hearts the meanest guest to slight;  But still observe with special grace  Those who obtain the foremost place,  Whether for happier skill in art  Or bearing in the rite their part.  Do you, I pray, with friendly mind  Perform the task to you assigned,  And work the rite, as bids the law,  Without omission, slip, or flaw\"    They answered: \"As thou seest fit  So will we do and naught omit.\"  The sage Vasistha then addressed  Sumantra called at his behest:  \"The princes of the earth invite,  And famous lords who guard the rite,  Priest, Warrior, Merchant, lowly thrall,  In countless thousands summon all.  Where'er their home be, far or near,  Gather the good with honour here,  And Janak, whose imperial sway  The men of Mithila(87) obey.  The firm of vow, the dread of foes,  Who all the lore of Scripture knows,  Invite him here with honour high,  King Dasaratha's old ally.  And Kasi's(88) lord of gentle speech,  Who finds a pleasant word for each,  In length of days our monarch's peer,  Illustrious king, invite him here.  The father of our ruler's bride,  Known for his virtues far and wide,  The king whom Kekaya's(89) realms obey,  Him with his son invite, I pray.  And Lomapad the Angas' king,  True to his vows and godlike, bring.  For be thine invitations sent  To west and south and orient.  Call those who rule Surashtra's(90) land,  Suvira's(91) realm and Sindhu's strand,  And all the kings of earth beside  In friendship's bonds with us allied:  Invite them all to hasten in  With retinue and kith and kin.\"    Vasishtha's speech without delay  Sumantra bent him to obey.  And sent his trusty envoys forth  Eastward and westward, south and north.  Obedient to the saint's request  Himself he hurried forth, and pressed  Each nobler chief and lord and king  To hasten to the gathering.  Before the saint Vasishtha stood  All those who wrought with stone and wood,  And showed the work which every one  In furtherance of the rite had done,  Rejoiced their ready zeal to see,  Thus to the craftsmen all said he:  \"I charge ye, masters, see to this,  That there be nothing done amiss,  And this, I pray, in mind be borne,  That not one gift ye give in scorn:  Whenever scorn a gift attends  Great sin is his who thus offends.\"    And now some days and nights had past,  And kings began to gather fast,  And precious gems in liberal store  As gifts to Dasaratha bore.  Then joy thrilled through Vasishtha's breast  As thus the monarch he addressed:  \"Obedient to thy high decree  The kings, my lord, are come to thee.  And it has been my care to greet  And honour all with reverence meet.  Thy servants' task is ended quite,  And all is ready for the rite.  Come forth then to the sacred ground  Where all in order will be found.\"  Then Rishyasring confirmed the tale:  Nor did their words to move him fail.  The stars propitious influence lent  When forth the world's great ruler went.    Then by the sage Vasishtha led      The priest begun to speed    Those glorious rites wherein is shed      The lifeblood of the steed.          Canto XIII. The Sacrifice Finished.      The circling year had filled its course,  And back was brought the wandering horse:  Then upon Sarju's northern strand  Began the rite the king had planned.  With Rishyasring the forms to guide,  The Brahmans to their task applied,  At that great offering of the steed  Their lofty-minded king decreed.  The priests, who all the Scripture knew,  Performed their part in order due,  And circled round in solemn train  As precepts of the law ordain.  Pravargya rites(92) were duly sped:  For Upasads(93) the flames were fed.  Then from the plant(94) the juice was squeezed,  And those high saints with minds well pleased  Performed the mystic rites begun  With bathing ere the rise of sun  They gave the portion Indra's claim,  And hymned the King whom none can blame.  The mid-day bathing followed next,  Observed as bids the holy text.  Then the good priests with utmost care,  In form that Scripture's rules declare,  For the third time pure water shed  On high souled Dasaratha's head.  Then Rishyasring and all the rest  To Indra and the Gods addressed  Their sweet-toned hymn of praise and prayer,  And called them in the rite to share.  With sweetest song and hymn entoned  They gave the Gods in heaven enthroned,  As duty bids, the gifts they claim,  The holy oil that feeds the flame.  And many an offering there was paid,  And not one slip in all was made.  For with most careful heed they saw  That all was done by Veda law.  None, all those days, was seen oppressed  By hunger or by toil distressed.  Why speak of human kind? No beast  Was there that lacked an ample feast.  For there was store for all who came,  For orphan child and lonely dame;  The old and young were well supplied,  The poor and hungry satisfied.  Throughout the day ascetics fed,  And those who roam to beg their bread:  While all around the cry was still,  \"Give forth, give forth,\" and \"Eat your fill.\"  \"Give forth with liberal hand the meal,  And various robes in largess deal.\"  Urged by these cries on every side  Unweariedly their task they plied:  And heaps of food like hills in size  In boundless plenty met the eyes:  And lakes of sauce, each day renewed,  Refreshed the weary multitude.  And strangers there from distant lands,  And women folk in crowded bands  The best of food and drink obtained  At the great rite the king ordained.  Apart from all, the Brahmans there,  Thousands on thousands, took their share  Of various dainties sweet to taste,  On plates of gold and silver placed,  All ready set, as, when they willed,  The twice-born men their places filled.  And servants in fair garments dressed  Waited upon each Brahman guest.  Of cheerful mind and mien were they,  With gold and jewelled earrings gay.  The best of Brahmans praised the fare  Of countless sorts, of flavour rare:  And thus to Raghu's son they cried:  \"We bless thee, and are satisfied.\"  Between the rites some Brahmans spent  The time in learned argument,  With ready flow of speech, sedate,  And keen to vanquish in debate.(95)    There day by day the holy train  Performed all rites as rules ordain.  No priest in all that host was found  But kept the vows that held him bound:  None, but the holy Vedas knew,  And all their six-fold science(96) too.  No Brahman there was found unfit  To speak with eloquence and wit.    And now the appointed time came near  The sacrificial posts to rear.  They brought them, and prepared to fix  Of Bel(97) and Khadir(98) six and six;  Six, made of the Palasa(99) tree,  Of Fig-wood one, apart to be:  Of Sleshmat(100) and of Devadar(101)  One column each, the mightiest far:  So thick the two, the arms of man  Their ample girth would fail to span.  All these with utmost care were wrought  By hand of priests in Scripture taught,  And all with gold were gilded bright  To add new splendour to the rite:  Twenty-and-one those stakes in all,  Each one-and-twenty cubits tall:  And one-and-twenty ribbons there  Hung on the pillars, bright and fair.  Firm in the earth they stood at last,  Where cunning craftsmen fixed them fast;  And there unshaken each remained,  Octagonal and smoothly planed.  Then ribbons over all were hung,  And flowers and scent around them flung.  Thus decked they cast a glory forth  Like the great saints who star the north.(102)  The sacrificial altar then  Was raised by skilful twice-born men,  In shape and figure to behold  An eagle with his wings of gold,  With twice nine pits and formed three-fold  Each for some special God, beside  The pillars were the victims tied;  The birds that roam the wood, the air,  The water, and the land were there,  And snakes and things of reptile birth,  And healing herbs that spring from earth:  As texts prescribe, in Scripture found,  Three hundred victims there were bound.  The steed devoted to the host  Of Gods, the gem they honour most,  Was duly sprinkled. Then the Queen  Kausalya, with delighted mien,  With reverent steps around him paced,  And with sweet wreaths the victim graced;  Then with three swords in order due  She smote the steed with joy, and slew.  That night the queen, a son to gain,  With calm and steady heart was fain  By the dead charger's side to stay  From evening till the break of day.  Then came three priests, their care to lead  The other queens to touch the steed,  Upon Kausalya to attend,  Their company and aid to lend.  As by the horse she still reclined,  With happy mien and cheerful mind,  With Rishyasring the twice-born came  And praised and blessed the royal dame.  The priest who well his duty knew,  And every sense could well subdue,  From out the bony"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24873"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 (#9)"],[1," of pain,  but the misty, mournful eyes did not swerve from his. The man stepped  forward and caught her in his arms.    \"Magdalen, good-bye, my darling. Kiss me once--only once--before I  go.\"    She loosened his arms and stepped back proudly.    \"No! No man kisses my lips unless he is to be my husband. Good-bye,  dear.\"    He bowed his head silently and went away, looking back not once, else  he might have seen her kneeling on the damp sand weeping noiselessly  and passionately.           *       *       *       *       *    Marian Lesley looked at his pale, determined face the next evening and  read it like an open book.    She had grown paler herself; there were purple shadows under the sweet  violet eyes that might have hinted of her own sleepless nights.    She greeted him calmly, holding out a steady, white hand of welcome.  She saw the traces of the struggle through which he had passed and  knew that he had come off victor.    The knowledge made her task a little harder. It would have been easier  to let slip the straining cable than to cast it from her when it lay  unresistingly in her hand.    For an instant her heart thrilled with an unutterably sweet hope.  Might he not forget in time? Need she snap in twain the weakened bond  between them after all? Perhaps she might win back her lost sceptre,  yet if--    Womanly pride throttled the struggling hope. No divided allegiance, no  hollow semblance of queenship for her!    Her opportunity came when Esterbrook asked with grave earnestness if  their marriage might not be hastened a little--could he not have his  bride in August? For a fleeting second Marian closed her eyes and the  slender hands, lying among the laces in her lap, clasped each other  convulsively.    Then she said quietly, \"Sometimes I have thought, Esterbrook, that it  might be better--if we were never married at all.\"    Esterbrook turned a startled face upon her.    \"Not married at all! Marian, what do you mean?\"    \"Just what I say. I do not think we are as well suited to each other  after all as we have fancied. We have loved each other as brother and  sister might--that is all. I think it will be best to be brother and  sister forever--nothing more.\"    Esterbrook sprang to his feet.    \"Marian, do you know what you are saying? You surely cannot have  heard--no one could have told you--\"    \"I have heard nothing,\" she interrupted hurriedly. \"No one has told me  anything. I have only said what I have been thinking of late. I am  sure we have made a mistake. It is not too late to remedy it. You will  not refuse my request, Esterbrook? You will set me free?\"    \"Good heavens, Marian!\" he said hoarsely. \"I cannot realize that you  are in earnest. Have you ceased to care for me?\" The rigidly locked  hands were clasped a little tighter.    \"No--I shall always care for you as my friend if you will let me. But  I know we could not make each other happy--the time for that has gone  by. I would never be satisfied, nor would you. Esterbrook, will you  release me from a promise which has become an irksome fetter?\"    He looked down on her upturned face mistily. A great joy was surging  up in his heart--yet it was mingled with great regret.    He knew--none better--what was passing out of his life, what he was  losing when he lost that pure, womanly nature.    \"If you really mean this, Marian,\" he said slowly, \"if you really have  come to feel that your truest love is not and never can be mine--that  I cannot make you happy--then there is nothing for me to do but to  grant your request. You are free.\"    \"Thank you, dear,\" she said gently, as she stood up.    She slipped his ring from her finger and held it out to him. He took  it mechanically. He still felt dazed and unreal.    Marian held out her hand.    \"Good-night, Esterbrook,\" she said, a little wearily. \"I feel tired. I  am glad you see it all in the same light as I do.\"    \"Marian,\" he said earnestly, clasping the outstretched hand, \"are you  sure that you will be happy--are you sure that you are doing a wise  thing?\"    \"Quite sure,\" she answered, with a faint smile. \"I am not acting  rashly. I have thought it all over carefully. Things are much better  so, dear. We will always be friends. Your joys and sorrows will be to  me as my own. When another love comes to bless your life, Esterbrook,  I will be glad. And now, good-night. I want to be alone now.\"    At the doorway he turned to look back at her, standing in all her  sweet stateliness in the twilight duskness, and the keen realization  of all he had lost made him bow his head with a quick pang of regret.    Then he went out into the darkness of the summer night.    An hour later he stood alone on the little point where he had parted  with Magdalen the night before. A restless night wind was moaning  through the pines that fringed the bank behind him; the moon shone  down radiantly, turning the calm expanse of the bay into a milk-white  sheen.    He took Marian's ring from his pocket and kissed it reverently. Then  he threw it from him far out over the water. For a second the diamond  flashed in the moonlight; then, with a tiny splash, it fell among the  ripples.    Esterbrook turned his face to the Cove, lying dark and silent in the  curve between the crescent headlands. A solitary light glimmered from  the low eaves of the Barrett cottage.    Tomorrow, was his unspoken thought, I will be free; to go back to  Magdalen.          An Invitation Given on Impulse      It was a gloomy Saturday morning. The trees in the Oaklawn grounds  were tossing wildly in the gusts of wind, and sodden brown leaves were  blown up against the windows of the library, where a score of girls  were waiting for the principal to bring the mail in.    The big room echoed with the pleasant sound of girlish voices and low  laughter, for in a fortnight school would close for the holidays, and  they were all talking about their plans and anticipations.    Only Ruth Mannering was, as usual, sitting by herself near one of the  windows, looking out on the misty lawn. She was a pale, slender girl,  with a sad face, and was dressed in rather shabby black. She had no  special friend at Oaklawn, and the other girls did not know much about  her. If they had thought about it at all, they would probably have  decided that they did not like her; but for the most part they simply  overlooked her.    This was not altogether their fault. Ruth was poor and apparently  friendless, but it was not her poverty that was against her. Lou  Scott, who was \"as poor as a church mouse,\" to quote her own frank  admission, was the most popular girl in the seminary, the boon  companion of the richest girls, and in demand with everybody. But Lou  was jolly and frank and offhanded, while Ruth was painfully shy and  reserved, and that was the secret of the whole matter.    There was \"no fun in her,\" the girls said, and so it came about that  she was left out of their social life, and was almost as solitary at  Oaklawn as if she had been the only girl there. She was there for the  special purpose of studying music, and expected to earn her own living  by teaching it when she left. She believed that the girls looked down  on her on this account; this was unjust, of course, but Ruth had no  idea how much her own coldness and reserve had worked against her.    Across the room Carol Golden was, as usual, the centre of an animated  group; Golden Carol as her particular friends sometimes called her,  partly because of her beautiful voice, and partly because of her  wonderful fleece of golden hair. Carol was one of the seminary pets,  and seemed to Ruth Mannering to have everything that she had not.    Presently the mail was brought in, and there was a rush to the table,  followed by exclamations of satisfaction or disappointment. In a few  minutes the room was almost deserted. Only two girls remained: Carol  Golden, who had dropped into a big chair to read her many letters; and  Ruth Mannering, who had not received any and had gone silently back to  her part of the window.    Presently Carol gave a little cry of delight. Her mother had written  that she might invite any friend she wished home with her to spend the  holidays. Carol had asked for this permission, and now that it had  come was ready to dance for joy. As to whom she would ask, there could  be only one answer to that. Of course it must be her particular  friend, Maud Russell, who was the cleverest and prettiest girl at  Oaklawn, at least so her admirers said. She was undoubtedly the  richest, and was the acknowledged \"leader.\" The girls affectionately  called her \"Princess,\" and Carol adored her with that romantic  affection that is found only among school girls. She knew, too, that  Maud would surely accept her invitation because she did not intend to  go home. Her parents were travelling in Europe, and she expected to  spend her holidays with some cousins, who were almost strangers to  her.    Carol was so much pleased that she felt as if she must talk to  somebody, so she turned to Ruth.    \"Isn't it delightful to think that we'll all be going home in a  fortnight?\"    \"Yes, very--for those that have homes to go to,\" said Ruth drearily.    Carol felt a quick pang of pity and self-reproach. \"Haven't you?\" she  asked.    Ruth shook her head. In spite of herself, the kindness of Carol's tone  brought the tears to her eyes.    \"My mother died a year ago,\" she said in a trembling voice, \"and since  then I have had no real home. We were quite alone in the world, Mother  and I, and now I have nobody.\"    \"Oh, I'm so sorry for you,\" cried Carol impulsively. She leaned  forward and took Ruth's hand in a gentle way. \"And do you mean to say  that you'll have to stay here all through the holidays? Why, it will  be horrid.\"    \"Oh, I shall not mind it much,\" said Ruth quickly, \"with study and  practice most of the time. Only now, when everyone is talking about  it, it makes me wish that I had some"]]]
