He has discovered the school-boy's  secret: that for the expression of unadulterated derision there is  nothing like the short sound of _a_, prolonged into a drawl. _Yah_,  _yah_, he cries; and sometimes, as you enter the woods, you may hear  him shouting so as to be heard for half a mile, \"Here comes a fool with  a gun; look out for him!\"    It is natural to think of the shrike in connection with the jay, but the  two have points of unlikeness no less than of resemblance. The shrike  is a taciturn bird. If he were a politician, he would rely chiefly on  what is known as the \"still hunt,\" although he too can scream loudly  enough on occasion. His most salient trait is his impudence, but even  that is of a negative type. \"Who are you,\" he says, \"that I should be at  the trouble to insult you?\" He has made a study of the value of silence  as an indication of contempt, and is almost human in his ability to  stare straight by a person whose presence it suits him to ignore. His  imperturbability is wonderful. Watch him as closely as you please, you  will never discover what he is thinking about. Undertake, for instance,  now that the fellow is singing from the top of a small tree only a few  rods from where you are standing,--undertake to settle the long dispute  whether his notes are designed to decoy small birds within his reach.  Those whistles and twitters,--hear them! So miscellaneous! so different  from anything which would be expected from a bird of his size and  general disposition! so very like the notes of sparrows! They must be  imitative. You begin to feel quite sure of it. But just at this point  the sounds cease, and you look up to discover that Collurio has fallen  to preening his feathers in the most listless manner imaginable. \"Look  at me,\" he says; \"do I act like one on the watch for his prey? Indeed,  sir, I wish the innocent sparrows no harm; and besides, if you must know  it, I ate an excellent game-breakfast two hours ago, while laggards like  you were still abed.\" In the winter, which is the only season when I  have been able to observe him, the shrike is to the last degree  unsocial, and I have known him to stay for a month in one spot all by  himself, spending a good part of every day perched upon a telegraph  wire. He ought not to be very happy, with such a disposition, one would  think; but he seems to be well contented, and sometimes his spirits are  fairly exuberant. Perhaps, as the phrase is, he enjoys _himself_; in  which case he certainly has the advantage of most of us,--unless,  indeed, we are easily pleased. At any rate, he is philosopher enough to  appreciate the value of having few wants; and I am not sure but that he  anticipated the vaunted discovery of Teufelsdrockh, that the fraction of  life may be increased by lessening the denominator. But even the stoical  shrike is not without his epicurean weakness. When he has killed a  sparrow, he eats the brains first; after that, if he is still hungry, he  devours the coarser and less savory parts. In this, however, he only  shares the well-nigh universal inconsistency. There are never many  thorough-going stoics in the world. Epictetus declared with an oath  that he should be glad to see _one_.[7] To take everything as equally  good, to know no difference between bitter and sweet, penury and plenty,  slander and praise,--this is a great attainment, a Nirvana to which few  can hope to arrive. Some wise man has said (and the remark has more  meaning than may at once appear) that dying is usually one of the last  things which men do in this world.    Against the foil of the butcher-bird's stolidity we may set the  inquisitive, garrulous temperament of the white-eyed vireo and the  yellow-breasted chat. The vireo is hardly larger than the goldfinch, but  let him be in one of his conversational moods, and he will fill a smilax  thicket with noise enough for two or three cat-birds. Meanwhile he keeps  his eye upon you, and seems to be inviting your attention to his  loquacious abilities. The chat is perhaps even more voluble. _Staccato_  whistles and snarls follow each other at most extraordinary intervals of  pitch, and the attempt at showing off is sometimes unmistakable.  Occasionally he takes to the air, and flies from one tree to another;  teetering his body and jerking his tail, in an indescribable fashion,  and chattering all the while. His \"inner consciousness\" at such a moment  would be worth perusing. Possibly he has some feeling for the grotesque.  But I suspect not; probably what we laugh at as the antics of a clown is  all sober earnest to him.    At best, it is very little we can know about what is passing in a bird's  mind. We label him with two or three _sesquipedalia verba_, give his  territorial range, describe his notes and his habits of nidification,  and fancy we have rendered an account of the bird. But how should we  like to be inventoried in such a style? \"His name was John Smith; he  lived in Boston, in a three-story brick house; he had a baritone voice,  but was not a good singer.\" All true enough; but do you call that a  man's biography?    The four birds last spoken of are all wanting in refinement. The jay and  the shrike are wild and rough, not to say barbarous, while the  white-eyed vireo and the chat have the character which commonly goes by  the name of oddity. All four are interesting for their strong  individuality and their picturesqueness, but it is a pleasure to turn  from them to creatures like our four common New England _Hylocichlae_, or  small thrushes. These are the real patricians. With their modest but  rich dress, and their dignified, quiet demeanor, they stand for the  true aristocratic spirit. Like all genuine aristocrats, they carry an  air of distinction, of which no one who approaches them can long remain  unconscious. When you go into their haunts they do not appear so much  frightened as offended. \"Why do you intrude?\" they seem to say; \"these  are our woods;\" and they bow you out with all ceremony. Their songs are  in keeping with this character; leisurely, unambitious, and brief, but  in beauty of voice and in high musical quality excelling all other music  of the woods. However, I would not exaggerate, and I have not found even  these thrushes perfect. The hermit, who is my favorite of the four, has  a habit of slowly raising and depressing his tail when his mind is  disturbed--a trick of which it is likely he is unconscious, but which,  to say the least, is not a mark of good breeding; and the Wilson, while  every note of his song breathes of spirituality, has nevertheless a most  vulgar alarm call, a petulant, nasal, one-syllabled _yeork_. I do not  know anything so grave against the wood thrush or the Swainson; although  when I have fooled the former with decoy whistles, I have found him more  inquisitive than seemed altogether becoming to a bird of his quality.  But character without flaw is hardly to be insisted on by sons of Adam,  and, after all deductions are made, the claim of the _Hylocichlae_ to  noble blood can never be seriously disputed. I have spoken of the four  together, but each is clearly distinguished from all the others; and  this I believe to be as true of mental traits as it is of details of  plumage and song. No doubt, in general, they are much alike; we may say  that they have the same qualities; but a close acquaintance will reveal  that the qualities have been mixed in different proportions, so that the  total result in each case is a personality strictly unique.    And what is true of the _Hylocichlae_ is true of every bird that flies.  Anatomy and dress and even voice aside, who does not feel the  dissimilarity between the cat-bird and the robin, and still more the  difference, amounting to contrast, between the cat-bird and the  bluebird? Distinctions of color and form are what first strike the eye,  but on better acquaintance these are felt to be superficial and  comparatively unimportant; _the_ difference is not one of outside  appearance. It is his gentle, high-bred manner and not his azure  coat, which makes the bluebird; and the cat-bird would be a cat-bird  in no matter what garb, so long as he retained his obtrusive  self-consciousness and his prying, busy-body spirit; all of which, being  interpreted, comes, it may be, to no more than this, \"Fine feathers  don't make fine birds.\"    Even in families containing many closely allied species, I believe that  every species has its own proper character, which sufficient intercourse  would enable us to make a due report of. Nobody ever saw a song-sparrow  manifesting the spirit of a chipper, and I trust it will not be in my  day that any of our American sparrows are found emulating the virtues of  their obstreperous immigrant cousin. Of course it is true of birds, as  of men, that some have much more individuality than others. But know any  bird or any man well enough, and he will prove to be himself, and nobody  else. To know the ten thousand birds of the world well enough to see  how, in bodily structure, habit of life, and mental characteristics,  every one is different from every other is the long and delightful task  which is set before the ornithologist.    But this is not all. The ornithology of the future must be ready to give  an answer to the further question how these divergences of anatomy and  temperament originated. How came the chickadee by his endless fund of  happy spirits? Whence did the towhee derive his equanimity, and the  brown thrush his saturnine temper? The waxwing and the vireo have the  same vocal organs; why should the first do nothing but whisper, while  the second is so loud and voluble? Why is one bird belligerent and  another peaceable; one barbarous and another civilized; one grave and  another gay? Who can tell? We can make here and there a plausible  conjecture. We know that the behavior of the blue jay varies greatly in  different"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28020"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume I (#9)"],[1,"ols, a measure since adopted in many States. She also  projected the system of normal schools for the higher education of  teachers. A scientific explorer as well as student, she wrote a work  on the \"Motive Power in the Circulation of the Blood,\" in  contradiction to Harvey's theory, which at once attracted the  attention of medical men. This work was one of the then accumulating  evidences of woman's adaptation to medical study.    In Ancient Egypt the medical profession was in the hands of women, to  which we may attribute that country's almost entire exemption from  infantile diseases, a fact which recent discoveries fully  authenticate. The enormous death-rate of young children in modern  civilized countries may be traced to woman's general enforced  ignorance of the laws of life, and to the fact that the profession of  medicine has been too exclusively in the hands of men. Though through  the dim past we find women still making discoveries, and in the feudal  ages possessing knowledge of both medicine and surgery, it is but  recently that they have been welcomed as practitioners into the  medical profession. Looking back scarcely a hundred years, we find  science much indebted to woman for some of its most brilliant  discoveries. In 1736, the first medical botany was given to the world  by Elizabeth Blackwell, a woman physician, whom the persecutions of  her male compeers had cast into jail for debt. As Bunyan prepared his  \"Pilgrim's Progress\" between prison walls, so did Elizabeth Blackwell,  no-wise disheartened, prepare her valuable aid to medical science  under the same conditions. Lady Montague's discovery of a check to the  small-pox, Madam Boivin's discovery of the hidden cause of certain  hemorrhages, Madam de Condray's invention of the manikin, are among  the notable steps which opened the way to the modern Elizabeth  Blackwell, Harriot K. Hunt, Clemence S. Lozier, Ann Preston, Hannah  Longshore, Marie Jackson, Laura Ross Wolcott, Marie Zakrzewska, and  Mary Putnam Jacobi, who are some of the earlier distinguished American  examples of woman's skill in the healing art.    Mary Gove Nichols gave public lectures upon anatomy in the United  States in 1838. Paulina Wright (Davis) followed her upon physiology in  1844, using a manikin in her illustrations.[1] Mariana Johnson  followed Mrs. Davis, but it was 1848 before Elizabeth Blackwell--the  first woman to pass through the regular course of medical  study--received her diploma at Geneva.[2] In 1845-6, preceding Miss  Blackwell's course of study, Dr. Samuel Gregory and his brother George  issued pamphlets advocating the education and employment of  women-physicians, and, in 1847, Dr. Gregory delivered a series of  lectures in Boston upon that subject, followed in 1848 by a school  numbering twelve ladies, and an association entitled the \"American  Female Medical Education Society.\" In 1832, Lydia Maria Child  published her \"History of Woman,\" which was the first American  storehouse of information upon the whole question, and undoubtedly  increased the agitation. In 1836, Ernestine L. Rose, a Polish  lady--banished from her native country by the Austrian tyrant, Francis  Joseph, for her love of liberty--came to America, lecturing in the  large cities North and South upon the \"Science of Government.\" She  advocated the enfranchisement of woman. Her beauty, wit, and eloquence  drew crowded houses. About this period Judge Hurlbut, of New York, a  leading member of the Bar, wrote a vigorous work on \"Human Rights,\"[3]  in which he advocated political equality for women. This work  attracted the attention of many legal minds throughout that State. In  the winter of 1836, a bill was introduced into the New York  Legislature by Judge Hertell, to secure to married women their rights  of property. This bill was drawn up under the direction of Hon. John  Savage, Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court, and Hon. John C. Spencer,  one of the revisers of the statutes of New York. It was in furtherance  of this bill that Ernestine L. Rose and Paulina Wright at that early  day circulated petitions. The very few names they secured show the  hopeless apathy and ignorance of the women as to their own rights. As  similar bills[4] were pending in New York until finally passed in  1848, a great educational work was accomplished in the constant  discussion of the topics involved. During the winters of 1844-5-6,  Elizabeth Cady Stanton, living in Albany, made the acquaintance of  Judge Hurlbut and a large circle of lawyers and legislators, and,  while exerting herself to strengthen their convictions in favor of the  pending bill, she resolved at no distant day to call a convention for  a full and free discussion of woman's rights and wrongs.    In 1828, Sarah and Angelina Grimke, daughters of a wealthy planter of  Charleston, South Carolina, emancipated their slaves and came North to  lecture on the evils of slavery, leaving their home and native place  forever because of their hatred of this wrong. Angelina was a natural  orator. Fresh from the land of bondage, there was a fervor in her  speech that electrified her hearers and drew crowds wherever she went.  Sarah published a book reviewing the Bible arguments the clergy were  then making in their pulpits to prove that the degradation of the  slave and woman were alike in harmony with the expressed will of God.  Thus women from the beginning took an active part in the Anti-Slavery  struggle. They circulated petitions, raised large sums of money by  fairs, held prayer-meetings and conventions. In 1835, Angelina wrote  an able letter to William Lloyd Garrison, immediately after the Boston  mob. These letters and appeals were considered very effective  abolition documents.    In May, 1837, a National Woman's Anti-Slavery Convention was held in  New York, in which eight States were represented by seventy-one  delegates. The meetings were ably sustained through two days. The  different sessions were opened by prayer and reading of the Scriptures  by the women themselves. A devout, earnest spirit prevailed. The  debates, resolutions, speeches, and appeals were fully equal to those  in any Convention held by men of that period. Angelina Grimke was  appointed by this Convention to prepare an appeal for the slaves to  the people of the free States, and a letter to John Quincy Adams  thanking him for his services in defending the right of petition for  women and slaves, qualified with the regret that by expressing himself  \"adverse to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,\" he  did not sustain the cause of freedom and of God. She wrote a stirring  appeal to the Christian women of the South, urging them to use their  influence against slavery. Sarah also wrote an appeal to the clergy of  the South, conjuring them to use their power for freedom.    Among those who took part in these conventions we find the names of  Lydia Maria Child, Mary Grove, Henrietta Sargent, Sarah Pugh, Abby  Kelley, Mary S. Parker, of Boston, who was president of the  Convention; Anne Webster, Deborah Shaw, Martha Storrs, Mrs. A. L.  Cox, Rebecca B. Spring, and Abigail Hopper Gibbons, a daughter of that  noble Quaker philanthropist, Isaac T. Hopper.    Abby Kelley was the most untiring and the most persecuted of all the  women who labored throughout the Anti-Slavery struggle. She traveled  up and down, alike in winter's cold and summer's heat, with scorn,  ridicule, violence, and mobs accompanying her, suffering all kinds of  persecutions, still speaking whenever and wherever she gained an  audience; in the open air, in school-house, barn, depot, church, or  public hall; on week-day or Sunday, as she found opportunity. For  listening to her, on Sunday, many men and women were expelled from  their churches. Thus through continued persecution was woman's  self-assertion and self-respect sufficiently developed to prompt her  at last to demand justice, liberty, and equality for herself.    In 1840, Margaret Fuller published an essay in the _Dial_, entitled  \"The Great Lawsuit, or Man _vs._ Woman: Woman _vs._ Man.\" In this  essay she demanded perfect equality for woman, in education, industry,  and politics. It attracted great attention and was afterward expanded  into a work entitled \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century.\" This, with her  parlor conversations, on art, science, religion, politics, philosophy,  and social life, gave a new impulse to woman's education as a  thinker.[5]    \"Woman and her Era,\" by Eliza Woodson Farnham, was another work that  called out a general discussion on the status of the sexes, Mrs.  Farnham taking the ground of woman's superiority. The great social and  educational work done by her in California, when society there was  chiefly male, and rapidly tending to savagism, and her humane  experiment in the Sing Sing (N. Y.), State Prison, assisted by  Georgiana Bruce Kirby and Mariana Johnson, are worthy of mention.    In the State of New York, in 1845, Rev. Samuel J. May preached a  sermon at Syracuse, upon \"The Eights and Conditions of Women,\" in  which he sustained their right to take part in political life, saying  women need not expect \"to have their wrongs fully redressed, until  they themselves have a voice and a hand in the enactment and  administration of the laws.\"    In 1847, Clarina Howard Nichols, in her husband's paper, addressed to  the voters of the State of Vermont a series of editorials, setting  forth the injustice of the property disabilities of married women.    In 1849, Lucretia Mott published a discourse on woman, delivered in  the Assembly Building, Philadelphia, in answer to a Lyceum lecture  which Richard H. Dana, of Boston, was giving in many of the chief  cities, ridiculing the idea of political equality for woman. Elizabeth  Wilson, of Ohio, published a scriptural view of woman's rights and  duties far in advance of the generally received opinions. At even an  earlier day, Martha Bradstreet, of"]]]
