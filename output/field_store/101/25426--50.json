With another frightened squeak, Danny  dived into the opening just in time. And what do you think he was  in? Why, an old tomato can Farmer Brown's boy had once used to  carry bait in when he went fishing at the Smiling Pool. He had  dropped it there on his way home.    Redtail screamed with rage and disappointment as he struck the  old can with his great claws. He had been sure, very sure, of  Danny Meadow Mouse this time! He tried to pick the can up, but he  couldn't get hold of it. It just rolled away from him every time,  try as he would. Finally, in disgust, he gave up and flew back to  the tree from which he had first seen Danny.    Of course Danny had been terribly frightened when the can  rolled, and by the noise the claws of Redtail made when they  struck his queer hiding place. But he wisely decided that the  best thing he could do was to stay there for a while. And it was  very fortunate that he did so, as he was very soon to find out.    [Illustration]                                      XXIII                       Reddy Fox Grows Curious      Danny Meadow Mouse had sat perfectly still for a long time inside  the old tomato can in which he had found a refuge from Redtail  the Hawk. He didn't dare so much as put his head out for a look  around, lest Redtail should be circling overhead ready to pounce  on him.    \"If I stay here long enough, he'll get tired and go away, if he  hasn't already,\" thought Danny. \"This has been a pretty exciting  morning so far, and I find that I am a little tired. I may as  well take a nap while I am waiting to make sure that the way is  clear.\"    With that Danny curled up in the old tomato can. But it wasn't  meant that Danny should have that nap. He had closed his eyes,  but his ears were still open, and presently he heard soft  footsteps drawing near. His eyes flew open, and he forgot all  about sleep, you may be sure, for those footsteps sounded  familiar. They sounded to Danny very, very much like the  footsteps of--whom do you think? Why, Reddy Fox! Danny's heart  began to beat faster as he listened. Could it be? He didn't dare  peep out. Presently a little whiff of scent blew into the old  tomato can. Then Danny knew--it was Reddy Fox.    \"Oh dear! I hope he doesn't find that I am in here!\" thought  Danny. \"I wonder what under the sun has brought him up here just  now.\"    If the truth were to be known, it was curiosity that had brought  Reddy up there. Reddy had been hunting for his breakfast some  distance away on the Green Meadows when Redtail the Hawk had  tried so hard to catch Danny Meadow Mouse. Reddy's sharp eyes had  seen Redtail the minute he left the tree in pursuit of Danny, and  he had known by the way Redtail flew that he saw something he  wanted to catch. He had watched Redtail swoop down and had heard  his scream of rage when he missed Danny because Danny had dodged  into the old tomato can. He had seen Redtail strike and strike  again at something on the ground, and finally fly off in disgust  with empty claws.    \"Now I wonder what it was Redtail was after and why he didn't  get it,\" thought Reddy. \"He acts terribly put out and disappointed.  I believe I'll go over there and find out.\"    Off he started at a smart trot toward the patch of short grass  where he had seen Redtail the Hawk striking at something on the  ground. As he drew near, he crept very softly until he reached  the very edge of the open patch. There he stopped and looked  sharply all over it. There was nothing to be seen but an old  tomato can. Reddy had seen it many times before.    \"Now what under the sun could Redtail have been after here?\"  thought Reddy. \"The grass isn't long enough for a grasshopper to  hide in, and yet Redtail didn't get what he was after. It's very  queer. It certainly is very queer.\"    He trotted out and began to run back and forth with his nose to  the ground, hoping that his nose would tell him what his eyes  couldn't. Back and forth, back and forth he ran, and then  suddenly he stopped.    \"Ha!\" exclaimed Reddy. He had found the scent left by Danny  Meadow Mouse when he ran across toward the old tomato can. Right  up to the old can Reddy's nose led him. He hopped over the old  can, but on the other side he could find no scent of Danny Meadow  Mouse. In a flash he understood, and a gleam of satisfaction  shone in his yellow eyes as he turned back to the old can. He  knew that Danny must be hiding in there.    \"I've got you this time!\" he snarled, as he sniffed at the  opening in the end of the can.    [Illustration]                                      XXIV                     Reddy Fox Loses His Temper      Reddy Fox had caught Danny Meadow Mouse, and yet he hadn't caught  him. He had found Danny hiding in the old tomato can, and it  didn't enter Reddy's head that he couldn't get Danny out when he  wanted to. He was in no hurry. He had had a pretty good breakfast  of grasshoppers, and so he thought he would torment Danny awhile  before gobbling him up. He lay down so that he could peep in at  the open end of the old can and see Danny trying to make himself  as small as possible at the other end. Reddy grinned until he  showed all his long teeth. Reddy always is a bully, especially  when his victim is a great deal smaller and weaker than himself.    \"I've got you this time, Mr. Smarty, haven't I?\" taunted Reddy.    Danny didn't say anything.    \"You think you've been very clever because you have fooled me two  or three times, don't you? Well, this time I've got you where  your tricks won't work,\" continued Reddy, \"so what are you going  to do about it?\"    Danny didn't answer. The fact is, he was too frightened to  answer. Besides, he didn't know what he could do. So he just kept  still, but his bright eyes never once left Reddy's cruel face.  For all his fright, Danny was doing some hard thinking. He had  been in tight places before and had learned never to give up  hope. Something might happen to frighten Reddy away. Anyway,  Reddy had to get him out of that old can before he would admit  that he was really caught.    For a long time Reddy lay there licking his chops and saying all  the things he could think of to frighten poor Danny Meadow Mouse.  At last he grew tired of this and made up his mind that that it  was time to end it and Danny Meadow Mouse at the same time. He  thrust his sharp nose in at the opening in the end of the old  can, but the opening was too small for him to get more than his  nose in, and he only scratched it on the sharp edges without so  much as touching Danny.    \"I'll pull you out,\" said Reddy and thrust in one black paw.    Danny promptly bit it so hard that Reddy yelped with pain and  pulled it out in a hurry. Presently he tried again with the other  paw. Danny bit this one harder still, and Reddy danced with pain  and anger. Then he lost his temper completely, a very foolish  thing to do, as it always is. He hit the old can, and away it  rolled with Danny Meadow Mouse inside. This seemed to make Reddy  angrier than ever. He sprang after it and hit it again. Then he  batted it first this way and then that way, growing angrier and  angrier. And all the time Danny Meadow Mouse managed to keep  inside, although he got a terrible shaking up.    Back and forth across the patch of short grass Reddy knocked the  old can, and he was in such a rage that he didn't notice where he  was knocking it to. Finally he sent it spinning into the long  grass on the far side of the open patch, close to one of Danny's  private little paths. Like a flash Danny was out and scurrying  along the little path. He dodged into another and presently into  a third, which brought him to a tangle of barbed wire left  there by Farmer Brown when he had built a new fence. Under this  he was safe.    [Illustration: _Like a flash, Danny dodged into a tangle of  barbed wire_]    \"Phew!\" exclaimed Danny, breathing very hard. \"That was the  narrowest escape yet! But I guess I'll get that special grass  seed I started out for, after all.\"    And he did, while to this day Reddy Fox wonders how Danny got out  of the old tomato can without his knowing it.        _And so you see what temper does        For those who give it rein;      It cheats them of the very thing        They seek so hard to gain._    Danny has had many more adventures, but there isn't room to tell  about them here. Besides, Grandfather Frog is anxious that you  should hear about the queer things that have happened to him.  They are told in the next book.
