I had nothing at heart but  your unspeakable profit, and great and endless good.\"    \"So, then, you indeed knew that I was here?\"    \"I was told so by a friend, but I did not believe him; a--a--at least I  did not know that it was true till I saw you.\"    \"Tell me this one thing, then, Robert, and all shall be forgotten and  forgiven. Who was that friend?\"    \"You do not know him.\"    \"How then does he know me?\"    \"I cannot tell.\"    \"Was he here present with you to-day?\"    \"Yes; he was not far distant. He came to this hill with me.\"    \"Where then is he now?\"    \"I cannot tell.\"    \"Then, wretch, confess that the devil was that friend who told you I  was here, and who came here with you. None else could possibly know of  my being here.\"    \"Ah! how little you know of him! Would you argue that there is neither  man nor spirit endowed with so much foresight as to deduce natural  conclusions from previous actions and incidents but the devil? Alas,  brother! But why should I wonder at such abandoned notions and  principles? It was fore-ordained that you should cherish them, and that  they should be the ruin of your soul and body, before the world was  framed. Be assured of this, however, that I had no aim of seeking you  but your good!\"    \"Well, Robert, I will believe it. I am disposed to be hasty and  passionate: it is a fault in my nature; but I never meant, or wished  you evil; and God is my witness that I would as soon stretch out my  hand to my own life, or my father's, as to yours.\" At these words,  Wringhim uttered a hollow exulting laugh, put his hands in his pockets,  and withdrew a space to his accustomed distance. George continued: \"And  now, once for all, I request that we may exchange forgiveness, and that  we may part and remain friends.\"    \"Would such a thing be expedient, think you? Or consistent with the  glory of God? I doubt it.\"    \"I can think of nothing that would be more so. Is it not consistent  with every precept of the Gospel? Come, brother, say that our  reconciliation is complete.\"    \"Oh yes, certainly! I tell you, brother, according to the flesh: it is  just as complete as the lark's is with the adder, no more so, nor ever  can. Reconciled, forsooth! To what would I be reconciled?\"    As he said this, he strode indignantly away. From the moment that he  heard his life was safe, he assumed his former insolence and revengeful  looks--and never were they more dreadful than on parting with his  brother that morning on the top of the hill. \"Well, go thy way,\" said  George; \"some would despise, but I pity thee. If thou art not a limb of  Satan, I never saw one.\"    The sun had now dispelled the vapours; and, the morning being lovely  beyond description, George sat himself down on the top of the hill, and  pondered deeply on the unaccountable incident that had befallen to him  that morning. He could in no-wise comprehend it; but, taking it with  other previous circumstances, he could not get quit of a conviction  that he was haunted by some evil genius in the shape of his brother, as  well as by that dark and mysterious wretch himself. In no other way  could he account for the apparition he saw that morning on the face of  the rock, nor for several sudden appearances of the same being, in  places where there was no possibility of any foreknowledge that he  himself was to be there, and as little that the same being, if he were  flesh and blood like other men, could always start up in the same  position with regard to him. He determined, therefore, on reaching  home, to relate all that had happened, from beginning to end, to his  father, asking his counsel and his assistance, although he knew full  well that his father was not the fittest man in the world to solve such  a problem. He was now involved in party politics, over head and ears;  and, moreover, he could never hear the names of either of the Wringhims  mentioned without getting into a quandary of disgust and anger; and all  that he would deign to say of them was, to call them by all the  opprobrious names he could invent.    It turned out as the young man from the first suggested: old Dalcastle  would listen to nothing concerning them with any patience. George  complained that his brother harassed him with his presence at all  times, and in all places. Old Dal asked why he did not kick the dog out  of his presence whenever he felt him disagreeable? George said he  seemed to have some demon for a familiar. Dal answered that he did not  wonder a bit at that, for the young spark was the third in a direct  line who had all been children of adultery; and it was well known that  all such were born half-deils themselves, and nothing was more likely  than that they should hold intercourse with their fellows. In the same  style did he sympathize with all his son's late sufferings and  perplexities.    In Mr. Adam Gordon, however, George found a friend who entered into all  his feelings, and had seen and known everything about the matter. He  tried to convince him that at all events there could be nothing  supernatural in the circumstances; and that the vision he had seen on  the rock, among the thick mist, was the shadow of his brother  approaching behind him. George could not swallow this, for he had seen  his own shadow on the cloud, and, instead of approaching to aught like  his own figure, he perceived nothing but a halo of glory round a point  of the cloud that was whither and purer than the rest. Gordon said, if  he would go with him to a mountain of his father's, which he named, in  Aberdeenshire, he would show him a giant spirit of the same dimensions,  any morning at the rising of the sun, provided he shone on that spot.  This statement excited George's curiosity exceedingly; and, being  disgusted with some things about Edinburgh, and glad to get out of the  way, he consented to go with Gordon to the Highlands for a space. The  day was accordingly set for their departure, the old laird's assent  obtained, and the two young sparks parted in a state of great  impatience for their excursion.    One of them found out another engagement, however, the instant after  this last was determined on. Young Wringhim went off the hill that  morning, and home to his upright guardian again without washing the  blood from his face and neck; and there he told a most woeful story  indeed: how he had gone out to take a morning's walk on the hill, where  he had encountered with his reprobate brother among the mist, who had  knocked him down and very near murdered him; threatening dreadfully,  and with horrid oaths, to throw him from the top of the cliff.    The wrath of the great divine was kindled beyond measure. He cursed the  aggressor in the name of the Most High; and bound himself, by an oath,  to cause that wicked one's transgressions return upon his own head  sevenfold. But, before he engaged further in the business of vengeance,  he kneeled with his adopted son, and committed the whole cause unto the  Lord, whom he addressed as one coming breathing burning coals of  juniper, and casting his lightnings before him, to destroy and root out  all who had moved hand or tongue against the children of the promise.  Thus did he arise confirmed, and go forth to certain conquest.    We cannot enter into the detail of the events that now occurred without  forestalling a part of the narrative of one who knew all the  circumstances--was deeply interested in them, and whose relation is of  higher value than anything that can be retailed out of the stores of  tradition and old registers; but, his narrative being different from  these, it was judged expedient to give the account as thus publicly  handed down to us. Suffice it that, before evening, George was  apprehended, and lodged in jail, on a criminal charge of an assault and  battery, to the shedding of blood, with the intent of committing  fratricide. Then was the old laird in great consternation, and blamed  himself for treating the thing so lightly, which seemed to have been  gone about, from the beginning, so systematically, and with an intent  which the villains were now going to realize, namely, to get the young  laird disposed of; and then his brother, in spite of the old  gentleman's teeth, would be laird himself.    Old Dal now set his whole interest to work among the noblemen and  lawyers of his party. His son's case looked exceedingly ill, owing to  the former assault before witnesses, and the unbecoming expressions  made use of by him on that occasion, as well as from the present  assault, which George did not deny, and for which no moving cause or  motive could be made to appear.    On his first declaration before the sheriff, matters looked no better:  but then the sheriff was a Whig. It is well known how differently the  people of the present day, in Scotland, view the cases of their own  party-men and those of opposite political principles. But this day is  nothing to that in such matters, although, God knows, they are still  sometimes barefaced enough. It appeared, from all the witnesses in the  first case, that the complainant was the first aggressor--that he  refused to stand out of the way, though apprised of his danger; and,  when his brother came against him inadvertently, he had aimed a blow at  him with his foot, which, if it had taken effect, would have killed  him. But as to the story of the apparition in fair day-light--the  flying from the face of it--the running foul of his brother pursuing  him, and knocking him down, why the judge smiled at the relation, and  saying: \"It was a very extraordinary story,\" he remanded George to  prison, leaving the matter to the High Court of Justiciary.    When the case came before that court, matters took a different turn.  The constant and sullen attendance of the one brother upon the other  excited suspicions; and these were in some manner confirmed when the  guards at Queensberry House deported"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#9)"],[1,"SWITCH.--A reversing switch is shown in Fig. 47. The base has  two plates (A, B) at one end, to which the parallel switch bars (C, D)  are hinged. The other end of the base has three contact plates (E, F, G)  to engage the swinging switch bars, these latter being at such distance  apart that they will engage with the middle and one of the outer plates.  The inlet wires, positive and negative, are attached to the plates (A,  B, respectively), and one of the outlet wires (H) is attached to the  middle contact plate (F), while the other wire is connected up with both  of the outside plates. When the switch bars (C, D) are thrown to the  left so as to be in contact with E, F, the outside plate (E) and the  middle plate (F) will be positive and negative, respectively; but when  the switch is thrown to the right, as shown in the figure, plate F  becomes positive and plate E negative, as shown.    [Illustration: _Fig. 46._ RHEOSTAT FORM OF SWITCH]    PUSH BUTTONS.--A push button is but a modified structure of a switch,  and they are serviceable because they are operating, or the circuit is  formed only while the finger is on the button.    [Illustration: _Fig. 47._ REVERSING SWITCH]    In its simplest form (Fig. 48) the push button has merely a circular  base (A) of insulating material, and near one margin, on the flat side,  is a rectangular plate (B), intended to serve as a contact plate as well  as a means for attaching one of the wires thereto. In line with this  plate is a spring finger (C), bent upwardly so that it is normally out  of contact with the plate (B), its end being held by a binding screw  (D). To effect contact, the spring end of the finger (C) is pressed  against the bar (B), as at E. This is enclosed in a suitable casing,  such as will readily suggest itself to the novice.    ELECTRIC BELL.--One of the first things the boy wants to make, and one  which is also an interesting piece of work, is an electric bell.    To make this he will be brought, experimentally, in touch with several  important features in electrical work. He must make a battery for the  production of current, a pair of electro-magnets to be acted upon by the  current, a switch to control it, and, finally, he must learn how to  connect it up so that it may be operated not only from one, but from two  or more push buttons.    [Illustration: _Fig. 48._ PUSH BUTTON]    HOW MADE.--In Fig. 49 is shown an electric bell, as usually constructed,  so modified as to show the structure at a glance, with its connections.  A is the base, B, B' the binding posts for the wires, C, C the  electro-magnets, C' the bracket for holding the magnets, D the armature,  E the thin spring which connects the armature with the post F, G the  clapper arm, H the bell, I the adjusting screw on the post J, K the wire  lead from the binding post B to the first magnet, L the wire which  connects the two magnets, M the wire which runs from the second magnet  to the post J, and N a wire leading from the armature post to the  binding post B'.    [Illustration: _Fig. 49._ ELECTRIC BELL]    The principle of the electric bell is this: In looking at Fig. 49, you  will note that the armature bar D is held against the end of the  adjusting screw by the small spring E. When a current is turned on, it  passes through the connections and conduits as follows: Wire K to the  magnets, wire M to the binding post J, and set screw I, then through the  armature to the post F, and from post F to the binding post B'.    [Illustration: _Fig. 50._ ARMATURE OF ELECTRIC BELL]    ELECTRIC BELL--HOW OPERATED.--The moment a current passes through the  magnets (C, C), the core is magnetized, and the result is that the  armature (D) is attracted to the magnets, as shown by the dotted lines  (O), when the clapper strikes the bell. But when the armature moves over  to the magnet, the connection is broken between the screw (I) and  armature (D), so that the cores of the magnets are demagnetized and lose  their pull, and the spring (E) succeeds in drawing back the armature.  This operation of vibrating the armature is repeated with great  rapidity, alternately breaking and re-establishing the circuit, by the  action of the current.    In making the bell, you must observe one thing, the binding posts (B,  B') must be insulated from each other, and the post J, or the post F,  should also be insulated from the base. For convenience we show the post  F insulated, so as to necessitate the use of wire (N) from post (F) to  binding post (B').    The foregoing assumes that you have used a cast metal base, as most  bells are now made; but if you use a wooden base, the binding posts (B,  B') and the posts (F, J) are insulated from each other, and the  construction is much simplified.    It is better, in practice, to have a small spring (P, Fig. 50) between  the armature (D) and the end of the adjusting screw (I), so as to give a  return impetus to the clapper. The object of the adjusting screw is to  push and hold the armature close up to the ends of the magnets, if it  seems necessary.    If two bells are placed on the base with the clapper mounted between  them, both bells will be struck by the swinging motion of the armature.    An easily removable cap or cover is usually placed over the coils and  armature, to keep out dust.    A very simple annunciator may be attached to the bell, as shown in the  following figures:    [Illustration: _Figs. 51-54._ ANNUNCIATOR]    ANNUNCIATORS.--Make a box of wood, with a base (A) 4\" x 5\" and 1/2 inch  thick. On this you can permanently mount the two side pieces (B) and two  top and bottom pieces (C), respectively, so they project outwardly  4-1/2 inches from the base. On the open front place a wood or metal  plate (D), provided with a square opening (D), as in Fig. 54, near its  lower end. This plate is held to the box by screws (E).    Within is a magnet (F), screwed into the base (A), as shown in Fig. 51;  and pivoted to the bottom of the box is a vertical armature (G), which  extends upwardly and contacts with the core of the magnet. The upper end  of the armature has a shoulder (H), which is in such position that it  serves as a rest for a V-shaped stirrup (I), which is hinged at J to the  base (C). This stirrup carries the number plate (K), and when it is  raised to its highest point it is held on the shoulder (H), unless the  electro-magnet draws the armature out of range of the stirrup. A spring  (L) bearing against the inner side of the armature keeps its upper end  normally away from the magnet core. When the magnet draws the armature  inwardly, the number plate drops and exposes the numeral through the  opening in the front of the box. In order to return the number plate to  its original position, as shown in Fig. 51, a vertical trigger (M)  passes up through the bottom, its upper end being within range of one of  the limbs of the stirrup.    This is easily made by the ingenious boy, and will be quite an  acquisition to his stock of instruments. In practice, the annunciator  may be located in any convenient place and wires run to that point.    [Illustration: _Fig. 55._ ALARM SWITCH ON WINDOW]    [Illustration: _Fig. 56._ BURGLAR ALARM ATTACHMENT TO WINDOW]    BURGLAR ALARM.--In order to make a burglar alarm connection with a bell,  push buttons or switches may be put in circuit to connect with the  windows and doors, and by means of the annunciators you may locate the  door or window which has been opened. The simplest form of switch for a  window is shown in the following figures:    The base piece (A), which may be of hard rubber or fiber, is 1/4 inch  thick and 1\" x 1-1/2\" in size.    [Illustration: _Fig. 57._ BURGLAR ALARM CONTACT]    At one end is a brass plate (B), with a hole for a wood screw (C), this  screw being designed to pass through the plate and also into the  window-frame, so as to serve as a means of attaching one of the wires  thereto. The inner end of the plate has a hole for a round-headed screw  (C') that also goes through the base and into the window-frame. It also  passes through the lower end of the heart-shaped metal switch-piece  (D).    The upper end of the base has a brass plate (E), also secured to the  base and window by a screw (F) at its upper end. The heart-shaped switch  is of such length and width at its upper end that when it is swung to  the right with one of the lobes projecting past the edge of the  window-frame, the other lobe will be out of contact with the plate (E).    [Illustration: _Fig. 58._ NEUTRAL POSITION OF CONTACT]    The window sash (G) has a removable pin (H), which, when the sash moves  upwardly, is in the path of the lobe of the heart-shaped switch, as  shown in Fig. 56, and in this manner the pin (H) moves the upper end of  the switch (D) inwardly, so that the other lobe contacts with the plate  (E), and establishes an electric circuit, as shown in Fig. 57. During  the daytime the pin (H) may be removed, and in order to protect the  switch the heart-shaped piece (D) is swung inwardly, as shown in Fig.  58, so that neither of the lobes is in contact with the plate (E).    WIRE CIRCUITING.--For the purpose of understanding fully the circuiting,  diagrams will be shown of the simple electric bell with two push  buttons; next in order, the circuiting with an annunciator and then the  circuiting necessary for a series of windows and doors, with annunciator  attachments.    [Illustration: _Fig. 59._ CIRCUITING FOR ELECTRIC BELL]    CIRCUITING SYSTEM WITH A BELL AND TWO PUSH BUTTONS.--Fig. 59 shows a  simple circuiting system which has two push buttons, although any number  may be used, so that the bell will ring when the circuit is closed by  either button.    THE PUSH BUTTONS AND THE ANNUNCIATOR BELLS.--Fig. 60 shows three push  buttons and an annunciator for each button. These three circuits are  indicated by A, B and C, so that when either button makes contact, a  complete circuit is formed"]]]
