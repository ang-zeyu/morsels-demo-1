Blacktail mother with her twins  _Photo by E. T. Seton_]      THE BLACKTAIL'S SAFETY IS IN THE HILLS    That day I learned the reason for the bounding flight, so beautiful, but  not the best or swiftest on the plain, yet the one that gives them  dominion and safety on the hills, that makes of them a hill folk that  the dangers of the plain can never reach.    So now, O traveller in the Park, if you approach too near the Blacktail  feeding near the great hotel, and so alarm them--for they are truly  wild--they make not for the open run as do the Antelope and the Hares,  not for the thickest bottomland as do the Whitetail and the Lynxes, but  for the steeper hillsides. They know right well where their safety lies,  and on that near and bushy bank, laying aside all alarm, they group and  pose in artless grace that tempts one to a lavish use of films and gives  the chance for that crowning triumph of the art, a wild animal group,  none of which is looking at the camera.    One more characteristic incident: In 1897 I was riding, with my wife,  from Yancey's over to Baronett's Bridge, when we came on a young buck  Blacktail. Now, said I, \"I am going to show you the most wonderful and  beautiful thing to be seen in the way of wild life speeding. You shall  now see the famous bounding of the Blacktail.\" Then I spurred out after  the young buck, knowing that all he needed was a little alarm to make  him perform. Did he take alarm and run? Not at all. He was in the  Yellowstone Sanctuary. He knew nothing of guns or dogs; he had lived all  his life in safety. He would trot a few steps out of my way, then turn  and gaze at me, but run, bound, and make for the high land, not a bit of  it. And to this day my fair companion has not seen the Blacktail  bounding up the hills.      THE ELK OR WAPITI--THE NOBLEST OF ALL DEER    The Rocky Mountain Elk, or Wapiti, is the finest of all true Deer. The  cows weigh 400 to 500 pounds, the bulls 600 or 800, but occasionally  1000. At several of the hotels a small herd is kept in a corral for the  pleasure and photography of visitors.    The latest official census puts the summer population of Elk in the  Yellowstone Park at 35,000, but the species is migratory, at least to  the extent of seeking a winter feeding ground with as little snow as  possible, so that most of them move out as snow time sets in. Small  herds linger in the rich and sheltered valleys along the Yellowstone,  Snake and nearby rivers, but the total of those wintering in the Park  is probably less than 5,000.      STALKING A BAND OF ELK    [Illustration]    In the summer months the best places in which to look for these Deer are  all the higher forests, especially along the timber-line. I had an  interesting stalk after a large band of them among the woods of Tower  Falls in the June of 1897. I had found the trail of a considerable herd  and followed it up the mountain till the \"sign\" was fresh. Then I tied  up my horse and went forward on foot. For these animals are sufficiently  acquainted with man as a mischief-maker to be vigilant in avoiding him,  even in the Park. I was cautiously crawling from tree to tree, when out  across an open space I descried a cow Elk and her calf lying down. A  little more crawling and I sighted a herd all lying down and chewing the  cud. About twenty yards away was a stump whose shelter offered chances  to use the camera, but my present position promised nothing, so I set  out carefully to cross the intervening space in plain view of scores of  Elk; and all would have been well but for a pair of mischievous little  Chipmunks. They started a most noisy demonstration against my approach,  running back and forth across my path, twittering and flashing their  tails about. In vain I prayed for a paralytic stroke to fall on my  small tormentors. Their aggravating plan, if plan it was, they succeeded  in fully carrying out. The Elk turned all their megaphone ears, their  funnel noses and their blazing telescopic eyes my way. I lay like a log  and waited; so did they. Then the mountain breeze veered suddenly and  bore the taint of man to those watchful mothers. They sprang to their  feet, some fifty head at least, half of them with calves by their sides,  and away they dashed with a roaring sound, and a rattling and crashing  of branches that is wonderfully impressive to hear, and nothing at all  to tell about.    I had made one or two rough sketches as I lay on the ground, but the  photographs were failures.    [Illustration: XII. A young investigator among the Deer at Fort  Yellowstone  _Photo by E. T. Seton_]    [Illustration: XIII. Elk in Wyoming: (a) \"Dawn\" _Photo by E. T. Seton_  (b) \"Nightfall\" _Photo by G. G. Seton_]    This band contained only cows engaged in growing their calves. According  to Elk etiquette, the bulls are off by themselves at a much higher  elevation, engaged in the equally engrossing occupation of growing their  antlers. Most persons are surprised greatly when first they learn that  the huge antlers of the Elk, as with most deer, are grown and shed each  year. It takes only five months to grow them. They are perfect in late  September for the fighting season, and are shed in March. The bull Elk  now shapes his conduct to his weaponless condition. He becomes as meek  as he was warlike. And so far from battling with all of their own sex  that come near, these big \"moollys\" gather in friendly stag-parties on a  basis of equal loss, and haunt the upper woods whose pasture is rich  enough to furnish the high power nutriment needed to offset the  exhausting drain of growing such mighty horns in such minimum time.    They are more free from flies too in these high places, which is  important, for even the antlers are sensitive while growing. They are  even more sensitive than the rest of the body, besides being less  protected and more temptingly filled with blood. A mosquito would surely  think he had struck it rich if he landed on the hot, palpitating end of  a Wapiti's thin-skinned, blood-gorged antlers. It is quite probable that  some of the queer bumps we see on the finished weapons are due to  mosquito or fly stings suffered in the early period of formation.      THE BUGLING ELK    During the summer the bulls attend strictly to their self-development,  but late August sees them ready to seek once more the mixed society of  their kind. Their horns are fully grown, but are not quite hardened and  are still covered with velvet. By the end of September these weapons are  hard and cleaned and ready for use, just as a thrilling change sets in  in the body and mind of the bull. He is full of strength and vigour, his  coat is sleek, his neck is swollen, his muscles are tense, his horns are  clean, sharp, and strong, and at their heaviest. A burning ambition to  distinguish himself in war, and win favours from the shy ladies of his  kind, grows in him to a perfect insanity; goaded by desire, boiling with  animal force, and raging with war-lust, he mounts some ridge in the  valley and pours forth his very soul in a wild far-reaching battle-cry.  Beginning low and rising in pitch to a veritable scream of piercing  intensity, it falls to a rumbled growl, which broken into shorter growls  dies slowly away. This is the famed bugling of the Elk, and however  grotesque it may seem when heard in a zoo, is admitted by all who know  it in its homeland to be the most inspiring music in nature--because of  what it means. Here is this magnificent creature, big as a horse, strong  as a bull, and fierce as a lion, standing in all the pride and glory of  his primest prime, announcing to all the world: \"I am out for a fight!  Do any of you want a F-I-G-H-T----!-!-!?\" Nor does he usually have long  to wait. From some far mountainside the answer comes:    \"Yes, yes, yes! _Yes, I Do_, Do, Do, Do!\"    A few more bugle blasts and the two great giants meet; and when they do,  all the world knows it for a mile around, without it being seen. The  crashing of the antlers as they close, the roars of hate, the squeals of  combat, the cracking of breaking branches as they charge and charge, and  push and strive, and--_sometimes_ the thud of a heavy body going down.    Many a time have I heard them in the distant woods, but mostly at night.  Often have I gone forth warily hoping to see something of the fight, for  we all love to see a fight when not personally in danger; but luck has  been against me. I have been on the battlefield next morning to see  where the combatants had torn up an acre of ground, and trampled  unnumbered saplings, or tossed huge boulders about like pebbles, but the  fight I missed.    One day as I came into camp in the Shoshonees, east of the Park, an old  hunter said: \"Say, you! you want to see a real old-time Elk fight? You  go up on that ridge back of the corral and you'll sure see a hull bunch  of 'em at it; not one pair of bulls, but _six_ of 'em.\"    I hurried away, but again I was too late; I saw nothing but the trampled  ground, the broken saplings, and the traces of the turmoil; the battling  giants were gone.    [Illustration]    Back I went and from the hunter's description made the sketch which I  give below. The old man said: \"Well, you sure got it this time. That's  exactly like it was. One pair was jest foolin', one was fencing and was  still perlite; but that third pair was a playin' the game for keeps. An'  for givin' the facts, that's away ahead of any photograph I ever seen.\"    Once I did come on the fatal battle-ground, but it was some time after  the decision; and there I found the body of the one who did not win. The  antlers are a fair index of the size and vigour of the stag, and if the  fallen one was so big and strong, what like was he who downed him,  pierced him through and left him on the plain.      SNAPPING A CHARGING BULL    At one time in a Californian Park I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27901"],[0,"Jewish Literature and Other Essays (#9)"],[1,"the discussions and method  that evolved the Halacha. It is easier to give an approximately true  presentation of the rabbinical system of practical morality as gleaned  from the Haggada. It must, of course, be borne in mind that Halacha and  Haggada are not separate works; they are two fibres of the same thread.  \"The whole of the Haggadistic literature--the hitherto unappreciated  archives of language, history, archaeology, religion, poetry, and  science--with but slight reservations may be called a national  literature, containing as it does the aggregate of the views and  opinions of thousands of thinkers belonging to widely separated  generations. Largely, of course, these views and opinions are peculiar  to the individuals holding them or to their time\"; still, every  Haggadistic expression, in a general way, illustrates some fundamental,  national law, based upon the national religion and the national  history.[15] Through the Haggada we are vouchsafed a glance into a  mysterious world, which mayhap has hitherto repelled us as strange and  grewsome. Its poesy reveals vistas of gleaming beauty and light,  luxuriant growth and exuberant life, while familiar melodies caress our  ears.    The Haggada conveys its poetic message in the garb of allegory song, and  chiefly epigrammatic saying. Form is disregarded; the spirit is  all-important, and suffices to cover up every fault of form. The Talmud,  of course, does not yield a complete system of ethics, but its practical  philosophy consists of doctrines that underlie a moral life. The  injustice of the abuse heaped upon it would become apparent to its  harshest critics from a few of its maxims and rules of conduct, such as  the following: Be of them that are persecuted, not of the  persecutors.--Be the cursed, not he that curses.--They that are  persecuted, and do not persecute, that are vilified and do not retort,  that act in love, and are cheerful even in suffering, they are the  lovers of God.--Bless God for the good as well as the evil. When thou  hearest of a death, say, \"Blessed be the righteous Judge.\"--Life is like  unto a fleeting shadow. Is it the shadow of a tower or of a bird? It is  the shadow of a bird in its flight. Away flies the bird, and neither  bird nor shadow remains behind.--Repentance and good works are the aim  of all earthly wisdom.--Even the just will not have so high a place in  heaven as the truly repentant.--He whose learning surpasses his good  works is like a tree with many branches and few roots, which a  wind-storm uproots and casts to the ground. But he whose good works  surpass his learning is like a tree with few branches and many roots;  all the winds of heaven cannot move it from its place.--There are three  crowns: the crown of the Law, the crown of the priesthood, the crown of  kingship. But greater than all is the crown of a good name.--Four there  are that cannot enter Paradise: the scoffer, the liar, the hypocrite,  and the backbiter.--Beat the gods, and the priests will  tremble.--Contrition is better than many flagellations.--When the  pitcher falls upon the stone, woe unto the pitcher; when the stone falls  upon the pitcher, woe unto the pitcher; whatever betides, woe unto the  pitcher.--The place does not honor the man, the man honors the  place.--He who humbles himself will be exalted; he who exalts himself  will be humbled,--Whosoever pursues greatness, from him will greatness  flee; whosoever flees from greatness, him will greatness  pursue.--Charity is as important as all other virtues combined.--Be  tender and yielding like a reed, not hard and proud like a cedar.--The  hypocrite will not see God.--It is not sufficient to be innocent before  God; we must show our innocence to the world.--The works encouraged by a  good man are better than those he executes.--Woe unto him that practices  usury, he shall not live; whithersoever he goes, he carries injustice  and death.    The same Talmud that fills chapter after chapter with minute legal  details and hairsplitting debates outlines with a few strokes the most  ideal conception of life, worth more than theories and systems of  religious philosophy. A Haggada passage says: Six hundred and thirteen  injunctions were given by Moses to the people of Israel. David reduced  them to eleven; the prophet Isaiah classified these under six heads;  Micah enumerated only three: \"What doth the Lord require of thee, but to  do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.\" Another  prophet limited them to two: \"Keep ye judgment, and do righteousness.\"  Amos put all the commandments under one: \"Seek ye me, and ye shall  live\"; and Habakkuk said: \"The just shall live by his faith.\"--This is  the ethics of the Talmud.    Another characteristic manifestation of the idealism of the Talmud is  its delicate feeling for women and children. Almost extravagant  affection is displayed for the little ones. All the verses of Scripture  that speak of flowers and gardens are applied in the Talmud to children  and schools. Their breath sustains the moral order of the universe: \"Out  of the mouth of babes and sucklings has God founded His might.\" They are  called flowers, stars, the anointed of God. When God was about to give  the Law, He demanded of the Israelites pledges to assure Him that they  would keep His commandments holy. They offered the patriarchs, but each  one of them had committed some sin. They named Moses as their surety;  not even he was guiltless. Then they said: \"Let our children be our  hostages.\" The Lord accepted them.    Similarly, there are many expressions to show that woman was held in  high esteem by the rabbis of the Talmud: Love thy wife as thyself; honor  her more than thyself.--In choosing a wife, descend a step.--If thy wife  is small, bend and whisper into her ear.--God's altar weeps for him that  forsakes the love of his youth.--He who sees his wife die before him  has, as it were, been present at the destruction of the sanctuary  itself; around him the world grows dark.--It is woman alone through whom  God's blessings are vouchsafed to a house.--The children of him that  marries for money shall be a curse unto him,--a warning singularly  applicable to the circumstances of our own times.    The peculiar charm of the Haggada is best revealed in its legends and  tales, its fables and myths, its apologues and allegories, its riddles  and songs. The starting-point of the Haggada usually is some memory of  the great past. It entwines and enmeshes in a magic network the lives of  the patriarchs, prophets, and martyrs, and clothes with fresh, luxuriant  green the old ideals and figures, giving them new life for a remote  generation. The teachers of the Haggada allow no opportunity, sad or  merry, to pass without utilizing it in the guise of an apologue or  parable. Alike for wedding-feasts and funerals, for banquets and days of  fasting, the garden of the Haggada is rifled of its fragrant blossoms  and luscious fruits. Simplicity, grace, and childlike merriment pervade  its fables, yet they are profound, even sublime, in their truth. \"Their  chief and enduring charm is their fathomless depth, their unassuming  loveliness.\" Poems constructed with great artistic skill do not occur.  Here and there a modest bud of lyric poesy shyly raises its head, like  the following couplet, describing a celebrated but ill-favored rabbi:        \"Without charm of form and face.      But a mind of rarest grace.\"    Over the grave of the same teacher the Talmud wails:        \"The Holy Land did beautify what womb of Shinar gave;      And now Tiberias' tear-filled eye weeps o'er her treasure's grave.\"    On seeing the dead body of the Patriarch Yehuda, a rabbi laments:        \"Angels strove to win the testimony's ark.      Men they overcame; lo! vanished is the ark!\"    Another threnody over some prince in the realm of the intellect:        \"The cedar hath by flames been seized;      Can hyssop then be saved?      Leviathan with hook was caught;      Alas! ye little fish!      The deep and mighty stream ran dry,      Ah woe! ye shallow brooks!\"    Nor is humor lacking. \"Ah, hamper great, with books well-filled, thou'rt  gone!\" is a bookworm's eulogy.    Poets naturally have not been slow to avail themselves of the material  stored in the Haggada. Many of its treasures, tricked out in modern  verse, have been given to the world. The following are samples:[16]        BIRTH AND DEATH        \"His hands fast clenched, his fingers firmly clasped,      So man this life begins.      He claims earth's wealth, and constitutes himself      The heir of all her gifts.      He thinks his hand may snatch and hold      Whatever life doth yield.        But when at last the end has come,      His hands are open wide,      No longer closed. He knoweth now full well,      That vain were all his hopes.      He humbly says, 'I go, and nothing take      Of all my hands have wrought.'\"    The next, \"Interest and Usury,\" may serve to give the pertinacious  opponent of the Talmud a better opinion of its position on financial  subjects:        \"Behold! created things of every kind        Lend each to each. The day from night doth take,        And night from day; nor do they quarrel make      Like men, who doubting one another's mind,      E'en while they utter friendly words, think ill.        The moon delighted helps the starry host,        And each returns her gift without a boast.      'Tis only when the Lord supreme doth will      That earth in gloom shall be enwrapped,        He tells the moon: 'Refrain, keep back thy light!'        And quenches, too, the myriad lamps of night.      From wisdom's fount hath knowledge ofttimes lapped,      While wisdom humbly doth from knowledge learn.        The skies drop blessings on the grateful earth,        And she--of precious store there is no dearth--      Exhales and sends aloft a fair return.      Stern law with mercy tempers its decree,        And "]]]
