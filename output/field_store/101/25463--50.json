She felt rather the more inclined to take this view of the  question inasmuch as Jean had grumbled, just a little--he would not do  more--at his wife's vanity in buying a gay dress of French fabric,  like a city dame, while all the women of the parish were wearing  homespun,--grogram, or linsey-woolsey,--whether at church or market.    Jean had not the heart to say another word to Babet about the French  gown. In truth, he thought she looked very pretty in it, better than  in grogram or in linsey-woolsey, although at double the cost. He only  winked knowingly at Babet, and went on to speaking of the Bourgeois.    \"They say the King has long hands, but this Intendant has claws longer  than Satan. There will be trouble by and by at the Golden Dog--mark  that, Babet! It was only the other day the Intendant was conversing with  the Sieur Cadet as they crossed the ferry. They forgot me, or thought  I did not hear them; but I had my ears open, as I always have. I heard  something said, and I hope no harm, will come to the good Bourgeois,  that is all!\"    \"I don't know where Christian folk would deal if anything happened him,\"  said Babet, reflectively. \"We always get civility and good pennyworths  at the Golden Dog. Some of the lying cheats of the Friponne talked in my  hearing one day about his being a Huguenot. But how can that be, Jean,  when he gives the best weight and the longest measure of any merchant in  Quebec? Religion is a just yard wand, that is my belief, Jean!\"    Jean rubbed his head with a perplexed air. \"I do not know whether he  be a Huguenot, nor what a Huguenot is. The Cure one day said he was a  Jansenist on all fours, which I suppose is the same thing, Babet--and it  does not concern either you or me. But a merchant who is a gentleman  and kind to poor folk, and gives just measure and honest weight, speaks  truth and harms nobody, is Christian enough for me. A bishop could not  trade more honestly; and the word of the Bourgeois is as reliable as a  king's.\"    \"The Cure may call the Bourgeois what he likes,\" replied Babet, \"but  there is not another Christian in the city if the good Bourgeois be not  one; and next the Church there is not a house in Quebec better known or  better liked by all the habitans, than the Golden Dog; and such bargains  too, as one gets there!\"    \"Ay, Babet! a good bargain settles many a knotty point with a woman.\"    \"And with a man too, if he is wise enough to let his wife do his  marketing, as you do, Jean! But whom have we here?\" Babet set her arms  akimbo and gazed.    A number of hardy fellows came down towards the ferry to seek a passage.    \"They are honest habitans of St. Anne,\" replied Jean. \"I know them; they  too are on the King's corvee, and travel free, every man of them! So  I must cry Vive le Roi! and pass them over to the city. It is like a  holiday when one works for nothing!\"    Jean stepped nimbly into his boat, followed by the rough country  fellows, who amused themselves by joking at Jean Le Nocher's increasing  trade and the need of putting on an extra boat these stirring times.  Jean put a good face upon it, laughed, and retorted their quips, and  plying his oars, stoutly performed his part in the King's corvee by  safely landing them on the other shore.    Meantime the officer who had lately crossed the ferry rode rapidly up  the long, straight highway that led up on the side of the mountain to  a cluster of white cottages and an old church, surmounted by a belfry  whose sweet bells were ringing melodiously in the fresh air of the  morning.    The sun was pouring a flood of golden light over the landscape. The  still glittering dewdrops hung upon the trees, shrubs, and long points  of grass by the wayside. All were dressed with jewels to greet the  rising king of day.    The wide, open fields of meadow, and corn-fields, ripening for harvest,  stretched far away, unbroken by hedge or fence. Slight ditches or banks  of turf, covered with nests of violets, ferns, and wild flowers of every  hue, separated contiguous fields. No other division seemed necessary in  the mutual good neighborhood that prevailed among the colonists, whose  fashion of agriculture had been brought, with many hardy virtues, from  the old plains of Normandy.    White-walled, red-roofed cottages, or more substantial farmhouses, stood  conspicuously in the green fields, or peered out of embowering orchards.  Their casements were open to catch the balmy air, while in not a few the  sound of clattering hoofs on the hard road drew fair faces to the window  or door, to look inquisitively after the officer wearing the white plume  in his military chapeau, as he dashed by on the gallant gray.    Those who caught sight of him saw a man worth seeing--tall,  deep-chested, and erect. His Norman features, without being perfect,  were handsome and manly. Steel-blue eyes, solidly set under a broad  forehead, looked out searchingly yet kindly, while his well-formed chin  and firm lips gave an air of resolution to his whole look that accorded  perfectly with the brave, loyal character of Colonel Philibert. He wore  the royal uniform. His auburn hair he wore tied with a black ribbon. His  good taste discarded perukes and powder, although very much in fashion  in those days.    It was long since he had travelled on the highway of Charlebourg, and he  thoroughly enjoyed the beauty of the road he traversed. But behind  him, as he knew, lay a magnificent spectacle, the sight of the great  promontory of Quebec, crowned with its glorious fortifications and  replete with the proudest memories of North America. More than once the  young soldier turned his steed, and halted a moment or two to survey  the scene with enthusiastic admiration. It was his native city, and the  thought that it was threatened by the national enemy roused, like an  insult offered to the mother that bore him. He rode onward, more than  ever impatient of delay, and not till he passed a cluster of elm trees  which reminded him of an adventure of his youth, did the sudden heat  pass away, caused by the thought of the threatened invasion.    Under these trees he remembered that he and his school companion, Le  Gardeur de Repentigny, had once taken refuge during a violent storm.  The tree they stood under was shattered by a thunderbolt. They were both  stunned for a few minutes, and knew they had had a narrow escape from  death. Neither of them ever forgot it.    A train of thoughts never long absent from the mind of Philibert started  up vividly at the sight of these trees. His memory flew back to Le  Gardeur and the Manor House of Tilly, and the fair young girl who  captivated his boyish fancy and filled his youth with dreams of glorious  achievements to win her smiles and do her honor. Among a thousand  pictures of her hung up in his mind and secretly worshipped he loved  that which presented her likeness on that day when he saved her  brother's life and she kissed him in a passion of joy and gratitude,  vowing she would pray for him to the end of her life.    The imagination of Pierre Philibert had revelled in the romantic visions  that haunt every boy destined to prominence, visions kindled by the eye  of woman and the hope of love.    The world is ruled by such dreams, dreams of impassioned hearts, and  improvisations of warm lips, not by cold words linked in chains of iron  sequence,--by love, not by logic. The heart with its passions, not the  understanding with its reasoning, sways, in the long run, the actions of  mankind.    Pierre Philibert possessed that rich gift of nature, a creative  imagination, in addition to the solid judgment of a man of  sense, schooled by experience and used to the considerations and  responsibilities of weighty affairs.    His love for Amelie de Repentigny had grown in secret. Its roots  reached down to the very depths of his being. It mingled, consciously or  unconsciously, with all his motives and plans of life, and yet his hopes  were not sanguine. Years of absence, he remembered, work forgetfulness.  New ties and associations might have wiped out the memory of him in the  mind of a young girl fresh to society and its delights. He experienced a  disappointment in not finding her in the city upon his return a few days  ago, and the state of the Colony and the stress of military duty had  so far prevented his renewing his acquaintance with the Manor House of  Tilly.    The old-fashioned hostelry of the Couronne de France, with its  high-pitched roof, pointed gables, and broad gallery, stood directly  opposite the rustic church and tall belfry of Charlebourg, not as a  rival, but as a sort of adjunct to the sacred edifice. The sign of the  crown, bright with gilding, swung from the low, projecting arm of a  maple-tree, thick with shade and rustling with the beautiful leaves  of the emblem of Canada. A few rustic seats under the cool maple were  usually occupied, toward the close of the day, or about the ringing of  the Angelus, by a little gathering of parishioners from the village,  talking over the news of the day, the progress of the war, the  ordinances of the Intendant, or the exactions of the Friponne.    On Sundays, after Mass and Vespers, the habitans of all parts of  the extended parish naturally met and talked over the affairs of the  Fabrique--the value of tithes for the year, the abundance of Easter  eggs, and the weight of the first salmon of the season, which was always  presented to the Cure with the first-fruits of the field, to ensure the  blessing of plenty for the rest of the year.    The Reverend Cure frequently mingled in these discussions. Seated in  his accustomed armchair, under the shade of the maple in summer, and in  winter by the warm fireside, he defended, ex cathedra, the rights of  the Church, and good-humoredly decided all controversies. He found his  parishioners more amenable to good advice over a mug "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#9)"],[1,"fled before him up the sky.    She tried to see Brother Fire, who guarded the squatting-place from  beasts, but he was not in sight. And far away she heard the mammoths  trumpeting as they went down to the drinking-place, and once some huge  bulk with heavy paces hurried along, making a noise like a calf, but  what it was she could not see. But she thought from the voice it was  Yaaa the rhinoceros, who stabs with his nose, goes always alone, and  rages without cause.    At last the little stars began to hide, and then the larger ones. It was  like all the animals vanishing before the Terror. The Sun was coming,  lord of the sky, as the grizzly was lord of the forest. Eudena wondered  what would happen if one star stayed behind. And then the sky paled to  the dawn.    When the daylight came the fear of lurking things passed, and she could  descend. She was stiff, but not so stiff as you would have been, dear  young lady (by virtue of your upbringing), and as she had not been  trained to eat at least once in three hours, but instead had often  fasted three days, she did not feel uncomfortably hungry. She crept down  the tree very cautiously, and went her way stealthily through the wood,  and not a squirrel sprang or deer started but the terror of the grizzly  bear froze her marrow.    Her desire was now to find her people again. Her dread of Uya the  Cunning was consumed by a greater dread of loneliness. But she had lost  her direction. She had run heedlessly overnight, and she could not tell  whether the squatting-place was sunward or where it lay. Ever and again  she stopped and listened, and at last, very far away, she heard a  measured chinking. It was so faint even in the morning stillness that  she could tell it must be far away. But she knew the sound was that of a  man sharpening a flint.    Presently the trees began to thin out, and then came a regiment of  nettles barring the way. She turned aside, and then she came to a fallen  tree that she knew, with a noise of bees about it. And so presently she  was in sight of the knoll, very far off, and the river under it, and the  children and the hippopotami just as they had been yesterday, and the  thin spire of smoke swaying in the morning breeze. Far away by the  river was the cluster of alders where she had hidden. And at the sight  of that the fear of Uya returned, and she crept into a thicket of  bracken, out of which a rabbit scuttled, and lay awhile to watch the  squatting-place.    The men were mostly out of sight, saving Wau, the flint-chopper; and at  that she felt safer. They were away hunting food, no doubt. Some of the  women, too, were down in the stream, stooping intent, seeking mussels,  crayfish, and water-snails, and at the sight of their occupation Eudena  felt hungry. She rose, and ran through the fern, designing to join them.  As she went she heard a voice among the bracken calling softly. She  stopped. Then suddenly she heard a rustle behind her, and turning, saw  Ugh-lomi rising out of the fern. There were streaks of brown blood and  dirt on his face, and his eyes were fierce, and the white stone of Uya,  the white Fire Stone, that none but Uya dared to touch, was in his hand.  In a stride he was beside her, and gripped her arm. He swung her about,  and thrust her before him towards the woods. \"Uya,\" he said, and waved  his arms about. She heard a cry, looked back, and saw all the women  standing up, and two wading out of the stream. Then came a nearer  howling, and the old woman with the beard, who watched the fire on the  knoll, was waving her arms, and Wau, the man who had been chipping the  flint, was getting to his feet. The little children too were hurrying  and shouting.    \"Come!\" said Ugh-lomi, and dragged her by the arm.    She still did not understand.    \"Uya has called the death word,\" said Ugh-lomi, and she glanced back at  the screaming curve of figures, and understood.    Wau and all the women and children were coming towards them, a scattered  array of buff shock-headed figures, howling, leaping, and crying. Over  the knoll two youths hurried. Down among the ferns to the right came a  man, heading them off from the wood. Ugh-lomi left her arm, and the two  began running side by side, leaping the bracken and stepping clear and  wide. Eudena, knowing her fleetness and the fleetness of Ugh-lomi,  laughed aloud at the unequal chase. They were an exceptionally  straight-limbed couple for those days.    They soon cleared the open, and drew near the wood of chestnut-trees  again--neither afraid now because neither was alone. They slackened  their pace, already not excessive. And suddenly Eudena cried and swerved  aside, pointing, and looking up through the tree-stems. Ugh-lomi saw  the feet and legs of men running towards him. Eudena was already running  off at a tangent. And as he too turned to follow her they heard the  voice of Uya coming through the trees, and roaring out his rage at them.    Then terror came in their hearts, not the terror that numbs, but the  terror that makes one silent and swift. They were cut off now on two  sides. They were in a sort of corner of pursuit. On the right hand, and  near by them, came the men swift and heavy, with bearded Uya, antler in  hand, leading them; and on the left, scattered as one scatters corn,  yellow dashes among the fern and grass, ran Wau and the women; and even  the little children from the shallow had joined the chase. The two  parties converged upon them. Off they went, with Eudena ahead.    They knew there was no mercy for them. There was no hunting so sweet to  these ancient men as the hunting of men. Once the fierce passion of the  chase was lit, the feeble beginnings of humanity in them were thrown to  the winds. And Uya in the night had marked Ugh-lomi with the death word.  Ugh-lomi was the day's quarry, the appointed feast.    They ran straight--it was their only chance--taking whatever ground came  in the way--a spread of stinging nettles, an open glade, a clump of  grass out of which a hyaena fled snarling. Then woods again, long  stretches of shady leaf-mould and moss under the green trunks. Then a  stiff slope, tree-clad, and long vistas of trees, a glade, a succulent  green area of black mud, a wide open space again, and then a clump of  lacerating brambles, with beast tracks through it. Behind them the chase  trailed out and scattered, with Uya ever at their heels. Eudena kept the  first place, running light and with her breath easy, for Ugh-lomi  carried the Fire Stone in his hand.    It told on his pace--not at first, but after a time. His footsteps  behind her suddenly grew remote. Glancing over her shoulder as they  crossed another open space, Eudena saw that Ugh-lomi was many yards  behind her, and Uya close upon him, with antler already raised in the  air to strike him down. Wau and the others were but just emerging from  the shadow of the woods.    Seeing Ugh-lomi in peril, Eudena ran sideways, looking back, threw up  her arms and cried aloud, just as the antler flew. And young Ugh-lomi,  expecting this and understanding her cry, ducked his head, so that the  missile merely struck his scalp lightly, making but a trivial wound, and  flew over him. He turned forthwith, the quartzite Fire Stone in both  hands, and hurled it straight at Uya's body as he ran loose from the  throw. Uya shouted, but could not dodge it. It took him under the ribs,  heavy and flat, and he reeled and went down without a cry. Ugh-lomi  caught up the antler--one tine of it was tipped with his own blood--and  came running on again with a red trickle just coming out of his hair.    Uya rolled over twice, and lay a moment before he got up, and then he  did not run fast. The colour of his face was changed. Wau overtook him,  and then others, and he coughed and laboured in his breath. But he kept  on.    At last the two fugitives gained the bank of the river, where the stream  ran deep and narrow, and they still had fifty yards in hand of Wau, the  foremost pursuer, the man who made the smiting-stones. He carried one, a  large flint, the shape of an oyster and double the size, chipped to a  chisel edge, in either hand.    They sprang down the steep bank into the stream, rushed through the  water, swam the deep current in two or three strokes, and came out  wading again, dripping and refreshed, to clamber up the farther bank.  It was undermined, and with willows growing thickly therefrom, so that  it needed clambering. And while Eudena was still among the silvery  branches and Ugh-lomi still in the water--for the antler had encumbered  him--Wau came up against the sky on the opposite bank, and the  smiting-stone, thrown cunningly, took the side of Eudena's knee. She  struggled to the top and fell.    They heard the pursuers shout to one another, and Ugh-lomi climbing to  her and moving jerkily to mar Wau's aim, felt the second smiting-stone  graze his ear, and heard the water splash below him.    Then it was Ugh-lomi, the stripling, proved himself to have come to  man's estate. For running on, he found Eudena fell behind, limping, and  at that he turned, and crying savagely and with a face terrible with  sudden wrath and trickling blood, ran swiftly past her back to the bank,  whirling the antler round his head. And Eudena kept on, running stoutly  still, though she must needs limp at every step, and the pain was  already sharp.    So that Wau, rising over the edge and clutching the straight willow  branches, saw Ugh-lomi towering over him, gigantic against the blue;  saw his whole body swing round, and the grip of his hands upon the  antler. The edge of the antler came sweeping through the air, and he saw  no more. The water under the osiers whirled and eddied and went crimson  six feet down the stream. Uya following stopped knee-high across the  stream, and the man who was swimming turned about.    The other men who trailed after--they were none of them very mighty men  (for"]]]
