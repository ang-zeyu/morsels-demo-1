Telephones - mobile cellular  This entry gives the total number of mobile cellular telephones in use.    Television - broadcast stations  This entry gives the total number of separate broadcast stations plus  any repeater stations.    Terminology  Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some  collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word Country  in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies,  areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities  in addition to the traditional countries or independent states.  Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense,  security, and defense activities in many entries. The Independence  entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and former ruling  states as well as other significant nationhood dates such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, or state succession that are not strictly  independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency  status noted in this same entry.    Terrain  This entry contains a brief description of the topography.    Total fertility rate  This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would  be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing  years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each  age. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of the level of  fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per  woman. This indicator shows the potential for population growth in the  country. High rates will also place some limits on the labor force  participation rates for women. Large numbers of children born to women  indicate large family sizes that might limit the ability of the  families to feed and educate their children.    Transnational Issues  This category includes only two entries at the present time - Disputes  - international and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going  beyond national boundaries.    Transportation  This category includes the entries dealing with the means for movement  of people and goods.    Transportation - note  This entry includes miscellaneous transportation information of  significance not included elsewhere. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27559"],[0,"The 2004 CIA World Factbook (#9)"],[1,"in barrels per day (bbl/day).  The  discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of stock  changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - exports  This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - imports  This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - proved reserves  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of crude oil in barrels  (bbl).  Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by  analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with a  high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a given  date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.    People  This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics of  the people and their society.    People - note  This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Personal Names - Capitalization  The Factbook capitalizes the surname or family name of individuals for  the convenience of our users who are faced with a world of different  cultures and naming conventions. The need for capitalization, bold  type, underlining, italics, or some other indicator of the individual's  surname is apparent in the following examples:  MAO Zedong, Fidel  CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni  Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah.  By knowing the surname, a  short form without all capital letters can be used with confidence as  in President Castro, Chairman Mao, President Bush, or Sultan Tunku  Salahuddin.  The same system of capitalization is extended to the names  of leaders with surnames that are not commonly used such as Queen  ELIZABETH II.    Personal Names - Spelling  The romanization of personal names in the Factbook normally follows the  same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic Names  for spelling place names.  At times, however, a foreign leader  expressly indicates a preference for, or the media or official  documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the  transliteration derived from the US Government standard.  In such  cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.    Personal Names - Titles  The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it)  immediately preceding a person's name.  A title standing alone is not  capitalized.  Examples: President PUTIN and President BUSH are chiefs  of state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier is  the head of the government, while in the US, the president is both  chief of state and head of government.    Petroleum  See entry for \"oil.\"    Petroleum products  See entry for \"oil.\"    Pipelines  This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting  products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.    Political parties and leaders  This entry includes a listing of significant political organizations  and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders  This entry includes a listing of organizations with leaders involved in  politics, but not standing for legislative election.    Population  This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based on  statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration  systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on  assumptions about future trends. The total population presents one  overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and  within its region. Note:  starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic  estimates for some countries (mostly African) have explicitly taken  into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin, Botswana,  Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central  African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the  Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras,  Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South  Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and  Zimbabwe.    Population below poverty line  National estimates of the percentage of the population falling below  the poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results  weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions of poverty  vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally  employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations.    Population growth rate  The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a  surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants  entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.  The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be  imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for  infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources  (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can  be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.    Ports and harbors  This entry lists the major ports and harbors selected on the basis of  overall importance to each country.  This is determined by evaluating a  number of factors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage,  facilities, military significance).    Public debt  This entry records the cumulative total of all government borrowings  less repayments that are denominated in a country's home currency.  Public debt should not be confused with external debt, which reflects  the foreign currency liablities of both the private and public sector  and must be financed out of foreign exchange earnings.    Radio broadcast stations  This entry includes the total number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast  stations.    Railways  This entry states the total route length of the railway network and of  its component parts by gauge: broad, standard, narrow, and dual. Other  gauges are listed under note.    Reference maps  This section includes world and regional maps.    Refugees and internally displaced persons  This entry includes those persons residing in a country as refugees or  internally displaced persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee  according to a United Nations Convention is \"a person who is outside  his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-  founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion,  nationality, membership in a particular social group or political  opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the  protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of  persecution.\" The UN established the Office of the UN High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to handle refugee matters worldwide. The  UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East  (UNRWA) has a different, operational definition for a Palestinian  refugee: \"a person whose normal place of residence was Palestine during  the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost both home and means  of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.\" However, UNHCR also  assists some 400,000 Palestinian refugees not covered under the UNRWA  definition. The term \"internally displaced person\" is not specifically  covered in the UN Convention; it is used to describe people who have  fled their homes for reasons similar to refugees, but who remain within  their own national territory and are subject to the laws of that state.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated  that in December 2003 there was a global population of 9.7 million  refugees and as many as 25 million IDPs.    Religions  This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents starting  with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total  population.    Reserves of foreign exchange and gold  This entry gives the dollar value for the stock of all financial assets  that are available to the central monetary authority for use in meeting  a country's balance of payments needs as of the end-date of the period  specified. This category includes not only foreign currency and gold,  but also a country's holdings of Special Drawing Rights in the  International Monetary Fund, and its reserve position in the Fund.    Sex ratio  This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age  groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and  for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an  indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For  instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now  attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong  preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and  fertility patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest among young adult  males who are unable to find partners.    Suffrage  This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to  vote is universal or restricted.    Telephone numbers  All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of the country code in  brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, and  the local number. The one component that is not presented is the  international access code, which varies from country to country. For  example, an international direct dial telephone call placed from the US  to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:         011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx, where       011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls;  01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls,       [34] is the country code for Spain,       (1) is the city code for Madrid,       577 is the local exchange, and       xxxx is the local telephone number.
