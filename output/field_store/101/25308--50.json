The papa could not help laughing, because that was just the very thing  he was going to say. \"Well, all right! What about that story? Do you  want to hear it, and take your chances of its being a Prince to the  end?\"    \"I suppose we'll have to; won't we, sister?\"    \"Yes, we'll leave it all to you, uncle,\" said the niece; and she thought  she would coax him up a little, and so she went on: \"I know you won't be  mean about it. Will he, brother?\"    \"No,\" said the nephew. \"I'll bet the Prince will keep a Prince all the  way through. What'll _you_ bet, sister?\"    \"I won't bet anything,\" said the niece, and she put her arm round the  papa's neck, and pressed her cheek up against his. \"I'll just leave it  to uncle, and if it _does_ turn into a little-pig story, it'll be for  the moral.\"    The nephew was not quite sure what a moral was; but at the bottom of his  heart he would just as soon have it a little-pig story as not. He had  got to thinking how funny a little pig would look in a Prince's clothes,  and he said, \"Yes, it'll be for the moral.\"    The papa was very contrary that morning. \"Well,\" said he, \"I don't know  about that. I'm not sure there's going to be any moral.\"    \"Oh, goody!\" said the niece, and she clapped her hands in great delight.  \"Then it's going to be a Prince story all through!\"    \"If you interrupt me in that way, it's not going to be any story at  all.\"    \"I didn't know you had begun it, uncle,\" pleaded the niece.    \"Well, I hadn't. But I was just going to.\" The papa lay quiet a while.  The fact is, he had not thought up any story at all; and he was so tired  of all the stories he used to tell his own children that he could not  bear to tell one of them, though he knew very well that the niece and  nephew would be just as glad of it as if it were new, and maybe gladder;  for they had heard a great deal about these stories, how perfectly  splendid they were--like the Pumpkin-Glory, and the Little Pig that took  the Poison Pills, and the Proud Little Horse-car that fell in Love with  the Pullman Sleeper, and Jap Doll Hopsing's Adventures in Crossing the  Continent, and the Enchantment of the Greedy Travellers, and the Little  Boy whose Legs turned into Bicycle Wheels. At last the papa said, \"This  is a very peculiar kind of a story. It's about a Prince and a Princess.\"    \"Oh!\" went both of the children; and then they stopped themselves, and  stuffed the covering into their mouths.    The papa lifted himself on his elbow and stared severely at them, first  at one, and then at the other. \"Have you finished?\" he asked, as if  they had interrupted him; but he really wanted to gain time, so as to  think up a story of some kind. The children were afraid to say anything,  and the papa went on with freezing politeness: \"Because if you have, I  might like to say something myself. This story is about a Prince and a  Princess, but the thing of it is that they had names almost exactly  alike. They were twins; the Prince was a boy and the Princess was a  girl; that was a point that their fairy godmother carried against the  wicked enchantress who tried to have it just the other way; but it made  the wicked enchantress so mad that the fairy godmother had to give in to  her a little, and let them be named almost exactly alike.\"    Here the papa stopped, and after waiting for him to go on, the nephew  ventured to ask, very respectfully indeed, \"Would you mind telling us  what their names were, uncle?\"    The papa rubbed his forehead. \"I have such a bad memory for names. Hold  on! Wait a minute! I remember now! Their names were Butterflyflutterby  and Flutterbybutterfly.\" Of course he had just thought up the names.    \"And which was which, uncle dear?\" asked the niece, not only very  respectfully, but very affectionately, too; she was so afraid he would  get mad again, and stop altogether.    \"Why, I should think you would know a girl's name when you heard it.  Butterflyflutterby was the Prince and Flutterbybutterfly was the  Princess.\"    \"I don't see how we're ever going to keep them apart,\" sighed the niece.    \"You've _got_ to keep them apart,\" said the papa. \"Because it's the  great thing about the story that if you can't remember which is the  Prince and which is the Princess whenever I ask you, the story has to  stop. It can't help it, and _I_ can't help it.\"    They knew he was just setting a trap for them, and the same thought  struck them both at once. They rose up and leaned over the papa, with  their arms across and their fluffy heads together in the form of a  capital letter A, and whispered in each other's ears, \"You say it's one,  and I'll say it's the other, and then we'll have it right between us.\"    They dropped back and pulled the covering up to their chins, and  shouted, \"Don't you tell! don't you tell!\" and just perfectly wriggled  with triumph.    The papa had heard every word; they were laughing so that they whispered  almost as loud as talking; but he pretended that he had not understood,  and he made up his mind that he would have them yet. \"A little and a  more,\" he said, \"and I should never have gone on again.\"    \"Go on! Go on!\" they called out, and then they wriggled and giggled  till anybody would have thought they were both crazy.    \"Well, where was I?\" This was another of the papa's tricks to gain time.  Whenever he could not think of anything more, he always asked, \"Well,  where was I?\" He now added: \"Oh yes! I remember! Well, once there were a  Prince and a Princess, and their names were Butterflyflutterby and  Flutterbybutterfly; and they were both twins, and both orphans; but they  made their home with their fairy godmother as long as they were little,  and they used to help her about the house for part board, and she helped  them about their kingdom, and kept it in good order for them, and left  them plenty of time to play and enjoy themselves. She was the greatest  person for order there ever was; and if she found a speck of dust or  dirt on the kingdom anywhere, she would have out the whole army and make  them wash it up, and then sand-paper the place, and polish it with a  coarse towel till it perfectly glistened. The father of the Prince and  Princess had taken the precaution, before he died, to subdue all his  enemies; and the consequence was that the longest kind of peace had set  in, and the army had nothing to do but keep the kingdom clean. That was  the reason why the fairy godmother had made the General-in-Chief take  their guns away, and arm them with long feather-dusters. They marched  with the poles on their shoulders, and carried the dusters in their  belts, like bayonets; and whenever they came to a place that the fairy  godmother said needed dusting--she always went along with them in a  diamond chariot--she made the General halloo out: 'Fix dusters! Make  ready! Aim! Dust!' And then the place would be cleaned up. But the  General-in-Chief used to go out behind the church and cry, it mortified  him so to have to give such orders, and it reminded him so painfully of  the good old times when he would order his men to charge the enemy, and  cover the field with gore and blood, instead of having it so awfully  spick-and-span as it was now. Still he did what the fairy godmother told  him, because he said it was his duty; and he kept his troops supplied  with sudsine and dustene, to clean up with, and brushes and towels. The  fairy godmother--\"    [Illustration: \"'FIX DUSTERS! MAKE READY! AIM! DUST!'\"]    \"Excuse me, uncle,\" said the nephew, with extreme deference, \"but I  should just like to ask you one question. Will you let me?\"    \"What is it?\" said the papa, in the grimmest kind of manner he could put  on.    \"Ah, brother!\" murmured the niece; for she knew that he was rather  sarcastic, and she was afraid that something ironical was coming.    [Illustration: \"THE GENERAL-IN-CHIEF USED TO GO BEHIND THE CHURCH AND  CRY.\"]    \"Well, I just wanted to ask whether this story was about the fairy  godmother, or about the Prince and Princess.\"    \"Very well, now,\" said the papa. \"You've asked your question. I didn't  promise to answer it, and I'm happy to say it stops the story. I'll  guess _I'll_ go to sleep again. I don't like being waked up this way in  the middle of the night, anyhow.\"    \"Now, brother, I hope you're satisfied!\" said the niece.    The nephew evaded the point. He said: \"Well, sister, if the story really  isn't going on, I should like to ask uncle another question. How big was  the fairy godmother's diamond chariot?\"    \"It was the usual sized chariot,\" answered the papa.    \"Whew! It must have been a pretty big diamond, then!\"    \"It was a _very_ big diamond,\" said the papa; and he seemed to forget  all about being mad, or else he had thought up some more of the story  to tell, for he went on just as if nothing had happened. \"The fairy  godmother was so severe with the dirt she found because it was a royal  prerogative--that is, nobody but the King, or the King's family, had a  right to make a mess, and if other people did it, they were infringing  on the royal prerogative.    \"You know,\" the papa explained, \"that in old times and countries the  royal family have been allowed to do things that no other family would  have been associated with if they had done them. That is about the only  use there is in having a royal family. But the fairy godmother of  Prince--\"    \"Butterflyflutterby,\" said the niece.    \"And Princess--\"    \"Flutterbybutterfly,\" said the nephew.    \"Correct,\" said the papa.    The children rose up into a capital A again, and whispered, \"He didn't  catch us _that_ time,\" and fell back, laughing, and the papa had to go  on.    \"The fairy godmother thought she would try to bring up the Prince and  Princess rather better than most Princes and Princesses were brought up,  and so she said that the only thing they should be allowed to do  different from other people was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],[0,"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#9)"],[1," Morris,\" he said. \"I haven't anything to do  with you, but I sha'n't let you sass me.\"    \"What have I said that's out of the way?\" asked William.    \"Oh, you're mighty innocent, you are! You're aidin' and abettin' Kit  Watson to escape from me, his lawful master.\"    \"I have no master, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, proudly.    \"Well, that's what they used to call 'em when I was a boy. Boys weren't  so pert and impudent in them days.\"    Meanwhile the blacksmith was recrossing the fence.    Kit and William took the opportunity to run, and by the time Mr.  Bickford was again on the roadside they were several rods away.    This naturally exasperated the blacksmith, who felt mortified at his  failure to overtake the youngsters. A new idea occurred to him.    \"You, Bill, do you want to earn a dime?\" he asked.    \"How?\" inquired William.    \"Just help me catch that boy Kit, and I'll give you ten cents.\"    \"I don't care to earn money that way, Mr. Bickford,\" responded William,  scornfully.    \"Good for you, William!\" exclaimed Kit.    \"You won't earn ten cents any easier,\" persisted Bickford.    \"I wouldn't do such a mean thing for a dollar, nor five dollars,\"  replied William. \"Kit's a friend of mine, and I'm going to stand by  him.\"    The blacksmith was made angry by this persistent refusal. Then again he  was faint and uncomfortable from having missed his breakfast, which  seemed likely to be indefinitely postponed.    \"I'll lick you, Bill Morris, as well as Kit, when I catch you,\" he said.    \"Probably you will--when you catch me!\" retorted William, in an  aggravating tone. \"Run faster, Kit.\"    The boys ran, but again they were impeded by the heavy valise, and  slowly but surely the blacksmith was gaining upon them.    Kit, who was again carrying the burden, began to show signs of distress,  and dropped behind his companion.    \"I can't hold out much longer, Bill,\" he said, puffing laboriously.    Aaron Bickford heard these words, and they impelled him to extra  exertion. At last he caught up and grasped Kit by the collar.    \"I've got ye at last!\" he cried, triumphantly.          CHAPTER XII.    MR. BICKFORD'S DEFEAT.      Aaron Bickford was a strong man. By his work at the forge he had  strengthened his muscles till they were like iron. So was Kit a strong  boy, but it would be absurd to represent him as a match for the sturdy  blacksmith.    \"I've got ye at last!\" repeated Bickford tightening his grasp of Kit's  coat collar.    \"Let go my collar!\" cried Kit, not struggling, for he knew that it would  be useless.    \"I'll let go your collar when I've got ye in the wagon,\" answered the  blacksmith, \"and not till then. You, Bill, bring along his valise. I'll  take ye home in the wagon, though it would be only right if I let ye  walk.\"    \"Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, \"you have no right to touch me. You have no  authority over me.\"    \"I ain't, hey? Well, we'll argy that matter when we get home.\"    And he commenced dragging Kit in the direction of the wagon.    It certainly seemed as if Kit's plans were destined, if not for defeat,  to postponement. Unconditional surrender was his only choice against the  superior strength of Aaron Bickford. It was certainly very vexatious.    But help was nearer than he anticipated.    They were now within sight of the circus tents, and Kit, to his joy,  descried the giant, Achilles Henderson, taking a morning walk, and  already within hearing distance.    \"Mr. Henderson!\" he called out, eagerly.    \"Who is that you're calling?\" asked the blacksmith sharply.    Achilles heard, and instantly recognized the boy who had talked with him  at Smyrna.    It took but a few strides to bring him to the spot where Kit was held in  captivity.    \"What does this mean?\" he asked.    \"This man is dragging me away without authority,\" answered Kit.    \"Who is he?\" asked the giant.    \"He is a blacksmith, and claims me as an apprentice, but I never agreed  to work for him.\"    \"That's a lie,\" said the blacksmith, \"he's my runaway apprentice.\"    \"I would believe the boy sooner than you,\" said Achilles, not favorably  impressed by the blacksmith's bull dog look.    \"It doesn't make any difference what you believe,\" said Bickford,  rudely; and he began to pull Kit in the direction of the wagon.    \"Let go that boy's collar,\" cried Achilles, sternly.    \"I won't!\" retorted the blacksmith. \"I advise you to mind your own  business.\"    Achilles Henderson, like most big men, was good natured, but he was  roused by the other's insolence. He carried war into the enemy's camp by  seizing the blacksmith and shaking him till he was compelled to release  his grasp.    \"What do you mean by this outrage?\" demanded Bickford, furiously.    \"It's only a gentle hint,\" said Achilles, smiling. \"Now, my friend, I've  got a piece of advice to give you. If that is your wagon back there  you'd better get into it as soon as convenient--the sooner the  better--and get out of my way or I'll give you a stronger hint.\"    The blacksmith was too indignant to be prudent. What! Confess himself  vanquished, and go home without the boy! The idea was intolerable to  him.    \"I'm goin' to take the boy,\" he said, angrily, and darting forward he  essayed to seize Kit by the collar again.    \"Oho! You need a stronger hint,\" said Achilles. With this he grasped the  blacksmith about the middle, and tossed him over the fence into the  adjoining field as easily as if he were a cat.    Aaron Bickford did not know what had happened to him. He lay motionless  for a few seconds, and then picked himself up with some difficulty, and  confronted the giant with mingled fear and anger.    \"I'll have the law of ye for this,\" he shouted.    Achilles laughed.    \"It's as you like,\" he said. \"I've got my witnesses here,\" pointing to  the two boys.    Mr. Bickford got over the fence, and sullenly turned in the direction of  his deserted wagon.    \"You'll hear from me again, all of you!\" he shouted, shaking his fist.    \"Don't trouble yourself to write,\" said the giant, jocosely. \"We can  worry along without a letter.\"    The blacksmith was too full of wrath for utterance. He kept on his way,  muttering to himself, and shaking his fist at intervals.    \"Now what's all this about?\" asked Achilles. \"What's the matter with our  amiable friend?\"    Kit explained.    \"So you don't want to be a blacksmith? Where are you going, if I may  inquire?\"    \"I'm going to join the circus,\" answered Kit.    \"In what capacity--as a lion tamer?\"    \"No; I shouldn't fancy that business. I am to be an acrobat.\"    \"An acrobat! But are you qualified?\" asked Achilles, somewhat surprised.    He had not heard of Kit's practice with the Vincenti brothers on the day  of his first visit to the circus.    \"I am pretty well qualified already,\" answered Kit, \"I saw Mr. Barlow  yesterday morning, and he promised me an engagement at ten dollars a  week.\"    \"Good!\" said Achilles, heartily. \"I am pleased to hear it. I took a  liking to you the other day, and I'm glad you're going to join us. But  do you think it wise to choose such a life?\"    \"You have chosen it,\" said Kit.    \"Yes; but what could I do--a man of my size? I must earn more than a  common man. My board and clothes both cost more. What do you think I  paid for this suit I have on?\"    \"I couldn't tell, sir.\"    \"Sixty dollars. The tailor only charges thirty dollars to a man of  ordinary size, but I am so absurdly large that I have to pay double  price.\"    \"Why don't you buy your suits ready made?\" asked Kit, smiling.    Achilles laughed heartily at the idea.    \"Show me a place where I can get ready made clothes to fit me,\" he  answered, \"and I will gladly accept your suggestion.\"    \"That may be a little difficult, I admit.\"    \"Why, you have no idea how inconvenient I find it to be so large. I  can't find a bed to suit me in any hotel. If I go to the theater I can't  crowd myself into an ordinary seat. I have to have all kinds of  clothing, inside and outside, made to order. My hats and shoes must also  be made expressly for me.\"    \"I suppose you get very well paid,\" suggested Kit.    \"Seventy-five dollars a week sounds pretty large, and would be if my  expenses were not so great. You wouldn't be a giant for that money,  would you?\"    \"I am not so ambitious,\" replied Kit, smiling. \"But there was a moment  when I wished myself of your size.\"    \"When was that?\"    \"When the blacksmith grasped me by the collar.\"    \"You don't have to work very hard,\" said William Morris.    \"My boy, it is pretty hard work to be stared at by a crowd of people. I  get tired of it often, but I see no other way of making a living.\"    \"You would make a pretty good blacksmith.\"    \"I couldn't earn more than a man of average strength, and that wouldn't  be enough, as I have explained.\"    \"Were your parents very tall?\" asked Kit.    \"My father was six feet in height, but my mother was a small woman. I  don't know what put it into me to grow so big. But here we are at the  lot. Will you come in?\"    \"When can I see Mr. Barlow?\" asked Kit, anxiously.    \"He is at the hotel. He won't be round till half-past nine. Have you two  boys had breakfast?\"    \"No,\" answered Kit; \"I'm nearly famished.\"    \"Come round to the circus tent. You are to be one of us, and will board  there. I guess we can provide for your friend, too.\"    Never was invitation more gladly accepted. Both Kit and William felt as  if they had not broken their fast for a week.          CHAPTER XIII.    BREAKFAST IN THE CIRCUS TENT.      Achilles entered the circus inclosure--the \"lot,\" as it is generally  called,--and made his way to a small tent situated not far from the one  devoted to the performances. An attendant was carrying in a plate of hot  steak and potatoes from the cook tent near by.    \"Is breakfast ready?\" asked Achilles.    \"Yes; any time you want it.\"    \"Is anybody inside?\"    \"Only Mademoiselle Louise.\"    \"Well, I want three breakfasts--for myself and my two young"]]]
