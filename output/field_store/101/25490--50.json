But though Nature also declares by so many indications what her wish  and object and desire is, we yet in a manner turn a deaf ear and will  not hear her warnings. The intercourse between friends is varied and  complex, and it must often happen that causes of suspicion and offence  arise, which a wise man will sometimes avoid, at other times remove,  at others treat with indulgence. The one possible cause of offence  that must be faced is when the interests of your friend and your own  sincerity are at stake. For instance, it often happens that friends need  remonstrance and even reproof. When these are administered in a kindly  spirit they ought to be taken in good part. But somehow or other there  is truth in what my friend Terence says in his _Andria_:    Compliance gets us friends, plain speaking hate.    Plain speaking is a cause of trouble, if the result of it is resentment,  which is poison of friendship; but compliance is really the cause of  much more trouble, because by indulging his faults it lets a friend  plunge into headlong ruin. But the man who is most to blame is he who  resents plain speaking and allows flattery to egg him on to his ruin. On  this point, then, from first to last there is need of deliberation and  care. If we remonstrate, it should be without bitterness; if we reprove,  there should be no word of insult. In the matter of compliance (for I  am glad to adopt Terence's word), though there should be every courtesy,  yet that base kind which assists a man in vice should be far from us,  for it is unworthy of a free-born man, to say nothing of a friend. It is  one thing to live with a tyrant, another with a friend. But if a man's  ears are so closed to plain speaking that he cannot bear to hear the  truth from a friend, we may give him up in despair. This remark of  Cato's, as so many of his did, shews great acuteness: \"There are people  who owe more to bitter enemies than to apparently pleasant friends:  the former often speak the truth, the latter never.\" Besides, it is a  strange paradox that the recipients of advice should feel no annoyance  where they ought to feel it, and yet feel so much where they ought not.  They are not at all vexed at having committed a fault, but very angry at  being reproved for it. On the contrary, they ought to be grieved at the  crime and glad of the correction.    25. Well, then, if it is true that to give and receive advice--the  former with freedom and yet without bitterness, the latter with patience  and without irritation--is peculiarly appropriate to genuine friendship,  it is no less true that there can be nothing more utterly subversive of  friendship than flattery, adulation, and base compliance. I use as many  terms as possible to brand this vice of light-minded, untrustworthy men,  whose sole object in speaking is to please without any regard to truth.  In everything false pretence is bad, for it suspends and vitiates our  power of discerning the truth. But to nothing it is so hostile as to  friendship; for it destroys that frankness without which friendship is  an empty name. For the essence of friendship being that two minds become  as one, how can that ever take place if the mind of each of the separate  parties to it is not single and uniform, but variable, changeable, and  complex? Can anything be so pliable, so wavering, as the mind of a man  whose attitude depends not only on another's feeling and wish, but on  his very looks and nods?         If one says \"No,\" I answer \"No\";       If \"Yes,\" I answer \"Yes.\"       In fine, I've laid this task upon myself       To echo all that's said--    to quote my old friend Terence again. But he puts these words into the mouth of  a Gnatho. To admit such a man into one's intimacy at all is a sign of  folly. But there are many people like Gnatho, and it is when they  are superior either in position or fortune or reputation that their  flatteries become mischievous, the weight of their position making up  for the lightness of their character. But if we only take reasonable  care, it is as easy to separate and distinguish a genuine from a  specious friend as anything else that is coloured and artificial from  what is sincere and genuine. A public assembly, though composed of men  of the smallest possible culture, nevertheless will see clearly  the difference between a mere demagogue (that is, a flatterer and  untrustworthy citizen) and a man of principle, standing, and solidity.  It was by this kind of flattering language that Gaius Papirius the  other day endeavoured to tickle the ears of the assembled people, when  proposing his law to make the tribunes re-eligible. I spoke against it.  But I will leave the personal question. I prefer speaking of Scipio.  Good heavens! how impressive his speech was, what a majesty there was  in it! You would have pronounced him, without hesitation, to be no mere  henchman of the Roman people, but their leader. However, you were there,  and moreover have the speech in your hands. The result was that a law  meant to please the people was by the people's votes rejected. Once  more to refer to myself, you remember how apparently popular was the law  proposed by Gaius Licinius Crassus \"about the election to the College  of Priests\" in the consulship of Quintus Maximus, Scipio's brother, and  Lucius Mancinus. For the power of filling up their own vacancies on  the part of the colleges was by this proposal to be transferred to the  people. It was this man, by the way, who began the practice of turning  towards the forum when addressing the people. In spite of this, however,  upon my speaking on the conservative side, religion gained an easy  victory over his plausible speech. This took place in my praetorship,  five years before I was elected consul, which shows that the cause  was successfully maintained more by the merits of the case than by the  prestige of the highest office.    26. Now, if on a stage, such as a public assembly essentially is,  where there is the amplest room for fiction and half-truths, truth  nevertheless prevails if it be but fairly laid open and brought into  the light of day, what ought to happen in the case of friendship, which  rests entirely on truthfulness? Friendship, in which, unless you both  see and show an open breast, to use a common expression, you can neither  trust nor be certain of anything--no, not even of mutual affection,  since you cannot be sure of its sincerity. However, this flattery,  injurious as it is, can hurt no one but the man who takes it in and  likes it. And it follows that the man to open his ears widest to  flatterers is he who first flatters himself and is fondest of himself. I  grant you that Virtue naturally loves herself; for she knows herself  and perceives how worthy of love she is. But I am not now speaking of  absolute virtue, but of the belief men have that they possess virtue.  The fact is that fewer people are endowed with virtue than wish to be  thought to be so. It is such people that take delight in flattery.  When they are addressed in language expressly adapted to flatter their  vanity, they look upon such empty persiflage as a testimony to the truth  of their own praises. It is not then properly friendship at all when the  one will not listen to the truth, and the other is prepared to lie. Nor  would the servility of parasites in comedy have seemed humorous to us  had there been no such things as braggart captains. \"Is Thais really  much obliged to me?\" It would have been quite enough to answer \"Much,\"  but he must needs say \"Immensely.\" Your servile flatterer always  exaggerates what his victim wishes to be put strongly. Wherefore,  though it is with those who catch at and invite it that this flattering  falsehood is especially powerful, yet men even of soldier and steadier  character must be warned to be on the watch against being taken in by  cunningly disguised flattery. An open flatterer any one can detect,  unless he is an absolute fool the covert insinuation of the cunning  and the sly is what we have to be studiously on our guard against. His  detection is not by any means the easiest thing in the world, for  he often covers his servility under the guise of contradiction, and  flatters by pretending to dispute, and then at last giving in and  allowing himself to be beaten, that the person hoodwinked may think  himself to have been the clearer-sighted. Now what can be more degrading  than to be thus hoodwinked? You must be on your guard against this  happening to you, like the man in the _Heiress_:         How have I been befooled! no drivelling dotards       On any stage were e'er so p1ayed upon.    For even on the stage we have no grosser representation of folly than  that of short-sighted and credulous old men. But somehow or other I have  strayed away from the friendship of the perfect, that is of the \"wise\"  (meaning, of course, such \"wisdom\" as human nature is capable of), to  the subject of vulgar, unsubstantial friendships. Let us then return to  our original theme, and at length bring that, too, to a conclusion.    27. Well, then, Fannius and Mucius, I repeat what I said before. It  is virtue, virtue, which both creates and preserves friendship. On  it depends harmony of interest, permanence, fidelity. When Virtue has  reared her head and shewn the light of her countenance, and seen and  recognised the same light in another, she gravitates towards it, and in  her turn welcomes that which the other has to shew; and from it springs  up a flame which you may call love or friendship as you please. Both  words are from the same root in Latin; and love is just the cleaving  to him whom you love without the prompting of need or any view to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28126"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, April, 1880 (#9)"],[1,"influence of the preachers of the Gospel of  Christ, and thereby ridding our country of that terrible pest called the  Bible, have given up their name. Their \"priests\" have adopted the  following arraignment of their old organization, a legitimate child of  their own:    \"Voted that, in the judgment of this Board, the name 'National Liberal  League' has become so widely and injuriously associated in the public mind  with attempts to repeal the postal laws prohibiting the circulation of  obscene literature by mail, with the active propagandism of demoralizing  and licentious social theories, and with the support of officials and  other public representatives who are on good grounds believed to have been  guilty of gross immoralities, that it has been thereby unfitted for use by  any organization which desires the support of the friends of 'natural  morality.' \"    Thus the child went into a far country and fed among swine, and, failing  to come to itself and return to its father's house, the old gentleman  disinherited it, _once_ and forever. A younger son, however, is christened  \"Liberal Union,\" and whether it will remain at home to take care of the  old man in his dotage remains to be seen.            HUXLEY'S PARADOX.      \"The whole analogy of natural operations furnish so complete and crushing  an argument against the intervention of any but what are called secondary  causes, in the production of all the phenomena of the universe, that, in  view of the intimate relations of man and the rest of the living world,  and between the forces exerted by the latter and all other forces, I can  see no reason for doubting that all are co-ordinate terms of nature's  great progression, from formless to formed, from the inorganic to the  organic, from blind force to conscious intellect and will.\" _Huxley's  Evidence of Man's Place in Nature_, London, 1864, p. 107.    A writer in the _Spectator_ charged Professor Huxley with Atheism. The  professor replies, in the number of that paper for February 10, 1866,  thus: \"I do not know that I care very much about popular odium, so there  is no great merit in saying that if I really saw fit to deny the existence  of a God I should certainly do so for the sake of my own intellectual  freedom, and be the honest Atheist you are pleased to say I am. As it  happens, however, I can not take this position with honesty, inasmuch as  it is, and always has been, a favorite tenet that Atheism is as absurd,  logically speaking, as Polytheism.\" In the same sheet, he says: \"The  denying the possibility of miracles seems to me quite as unjustifiable as  Atheism.\" Is Huxley in conflict with Huxley?            THE TRIUMPHING REIGN OF LIGHT.      The next psychic cycle, it seems to me, will witness a synthesis of  thought and faith, a recognition of the fact that it is impossible for  reason to find solid ground that is not consecrated ground; that all  philosophy and all science belong to religion; that all truth is a  revelation of God; that the truths of written revelation, if not  intelligible to reason, are nevertheless consonant with reason; and that  divine agency, instead of standing removed from man by infinite intervals  of time and space, is, indeed, the true name of those energies which work  their myriad phenomena in the natural world around us. This  consummation--at once the inspiration of a fervent religion and the  prophecy of the loftiest science--is to be the noontide reign of wedded  intellect and faith, whose morning rays already stream far above our  horizon.--_Winchell._ Re. and Sci. p. 84.                      -------------------------------------    \"Experience proves to us that the matter which we regard as inert and  dead, assumes action, intelligence, and life, when it is combined in a  certain way.\"--_Atheist._    \"But how does a germ come to live?\"--_Deist._    \"Life is organization with feeling.\"--_Atheist._    \"But that you have these two properties from the motion of\" dead atoms, or  matter alone, it is impossible to give any proof; and if it can not be  proved, why affirm it?
