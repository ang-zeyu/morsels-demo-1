Ovulation, which in  the sexually mature woman recurs at four-weekly intervals, also gives  rise to certain permanent changes in the ovaries. The site of each  ruptured Graafian follicle becomes cicatrised, and in consequence of the  formation of these little scars, the ovary no longer retains the  smoothness of surface which was characteristic of the organ in  childhood. From birth onwards the ovaries gradually increase in size,  but the growth is disproportionate in different diameters. Thus, for  instance, during the eighth year of life, growth is chiefly in  thickness, so that the ratio between the length and the thickness  becomes less than before. The structure of the ovaries also varies at  different ages. In a girl of three years, the primitive ovarian  follicles number about 400,000; at the age of eight it is estimated that  their number has been reduced to about 36,000. Certainly the majority of  the primitive follicles come to nothing. True Graafian follicles, of  which an account has already been given, are not usually formed prior  to the beginning of the puberal development; occasionally, however, they  are formed in the ovaries of immature girls.      Let us now pass to the consideration of the sexual impulse. We learn  from personal observation that two entirely distinct processes  participate in this impulse. In the first place, we have the physical  processes that take place in the genital organs; these are in part  unperceived, but in part they affect consciousness in the form of common  sensations, or as ordinary tactile and other similar sensations. In the  second place, we have those higher psychical processes by means of which  man is attracted to woman, and woman to man. In our actual experience of  the normal sexual life, both these groups of processes do, as a matter  of fact, work in unison; but not only is it possible for us to  distinguish them analytically; it is, in addition, possible in many  instances to observe them in action clinically isolated each from the  other. A long while ago I utilised this distinction for the analysis of  the sexual impulse, describing the impulse in so far as it was confined  to the peripheral organs as the _detumescence-impulse_ (from  _detumescere_, to decrease in size), and in so far as it takes the form  of processes tending towards bodily and mental approximation to another  individual, as the _contrectation-impulse_ (from _contrectare_ to touch,  or to think about). The distinction will become clearer to our minds if  we familiarise ourselves first with cases in which either process occurs  independently of the other. The detumescence-impulse is sometimes the  sole manifestation of the sexual impulse. Certain idiots practise  masturbation as a physical act, because sensations proceeding from the  genital organs impel them to do so, precisely as itching of an area of  the skin impels us to scratch. They masturbate without thinking of  another person, and they feel no impulsion whatever towards sexual  contact with another person. Analogous phenomena may be witnessed in the  animal world also, in connexion with the masturbatory acts of monkeys,  bulls, and stallions. When a stallion kicks its genital organs again and  again with its hind-foot, and repeats the action until ejaculation  ensues, we are hardly justified in assuming that the animal has the  idea of a mare before its mind. We must rather suppose that we have to  do with a local physical stimulus, to which the stallion reacts in the  manner above described. The other component, also, of the sexual  impulse, the contrectation-impulse, manifests itself, occasionally, at  any rate, in isolation. Certain boys, long before the appearance of any  signs of the puberal development, are impelled towards physical contact  with members of the other sex, to kiss them, to think of them, although  these boys may exhibit no tendency whatever to masturbate, or to  manipulate their genital organs. It often happens, indeed, that such a  boy is himself greatly astonished to find, some day, that these ideas  are reflected to the genital organs, giving rise to erection; or, when  he is embracing a girl, to experience erection and ejaculation. In the  sexually mature normal man, the detumescence-impulse and the  contrectation-impulse act in unison, and hence he is impelled towards  intimate contact with the woman, and is ultimately driven to effect  detumescence by the practice of coitus. Nevertheless, we must hold fast  to the idea that in the normal adult man the sexual processes may also  be theoretically analysed into these two components.    This is true also of woman, in whom the processes in the genital organs  are equally separable from those which impel to contact with a member of  the other sex. But in woman, the processes in the genital organs do not  culminate in the ejection of the reproductive cells, that is, of the  ovum, but, as we have seen, in the ejaculation of indifferent  secretions. In the woman, also, the detumescence impulse is occasionally  met with in isolation--for example, in many female idiots. In the animal  world, too, we encounter it as an isolated phenomenon. Certain mares,  when rutting, rub their hind quarters against some object in their  stalls. The contrectation-impulse may also manifest itself in isolation  in woman. It is then directed towards the male, but is not in any way  associated with the wish for a definite sexual act. Most commonly,  however, in woman also the two components of the sexual impulse are  united, and from this union results the impulsion towards coitus. But to  this extent the conditions in woman are apt to differ from those in  man, inasmuch as, in the former, voluptuous sensations are more often in  abeyance; or in woman voluptuous pleasure may not arise during coitus,  but may be produced in some other way, as, for instance, by a  masturbatory act.    The sexual impulse, and indeed either of its components, may be excited  either by bodily or by mental stimuli; but we must always bear in mind  the fact that in normal adults, both male and female, the two components  are so intimately associated that they can as a rule be separated only  by artificial analysis. The nature and mode of operation of the stimuli  need not be further discussed, since enough has been said about the  matter in our description of erection. Nor is it necessary in this place  to deal with such differences as may exist between the psychosexual life  of the child and that of the adult, since this matter will be fully  considered in the fourth chapter. In this chapter my aim has merely been  to give a general description of the sexual impulse.    Here I need allude to one more point only, a knowledge of which is  indispensable for the understanding of the sexual life of the child,  namely, the connexion between the central processes and the peripheral  voluptuous sensation. Let us ask, in the first place, by what means the  voluptuous sensation, the voluptuous acme, and the sense of  satisfaction, are produced. Various factors are here operative. A  homosexual man, in heterosexual coitus, by keeping present to his  imagination the idea of coitus with a man, may succeed in obtaining  erection and ejaculation; but he does not experience the voluptuous  acme, nor does he feel the sense of satisfaction. Notwithstanding the  fact that the peripheral processes occur in normal fashion, the sense of  satisfaction remains in abeyance; because the act is in his case  inadequate, the sexual act in which he is engaged lacks harmonious  relationship to his sexual impulse. But the same homosexual man,  embracing a man with whom he is in full sympathy, will experience alike  the voluptuous acme and the sense of satisfaction. _Mutatis mutandis_,  the like is true of woman. Many cases which have been regarded as  instances of sexual anaesthesia would appear in quite another light if  the woman concerned were to have intercourse with a sexually  sympathetic man. I have myself known cases in which women were able to  experience the voluptuous acme in intercourse with men whom they  earnestly loved, whilst in intercourse with men to whom they were  indifferent, the voluptuous sensation and the sense of satisfaction were  wanting, even though in some of these cases the peripheral processes  culminated in ejaculation. Such a physically complete sexual act,  without voluptuous acme or sense of satisfaction, may occur when the  woman, having intercourse with a man whom she does not love, pictures in  imagination that she is having intercourse with her lover.  Unquestionably, the psychical processes are of the greatest importance  in contributing to the occurrence of the voluptuous sensation and the  sense of satisfaction. On the other hand, of course, certain peripheral  conditions must also be fulfilled if the voluptuous acme is to ensue.  Among these conditions may be mentioned a certain anatomical state of  the skin and the nerves concerned. Experience also shows that in the  adult the voluptuous acme coincides with the act of ejaculation.  Ejaculation is effected by the rhythmical contraction of certain  definite muscles, and Otto Adler believes that it is these contractions  which are principally effective in producing the voluptuous acme, and  that actual ejaculation is not indispensable. He believes, that is, that  the voluptuous acme may occur in the absence of any discharge of actual  secretion.    In any case, let us hold fast to the fact that in the adult, for the  occurrence of the voluptuous acme and of the sense of full satisfaction,  certain central processes are, in general, indispensable.          CHAPTER III    SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION IN CHILDHOOD      In the previous chapter, I have described the differences between the  reproductive organs of men and women, and between those of adults and  children, respectively.

He attempted  to ascertain the apparent diameter of Sirius, and made observations with  regard to the visibility of the stars. The Cassini family produced  several generations of eminent astronomers, whose discoveries and  investigations were of much value in advancing the science of astronomy.    OLAUS ROEMER, an eminent Danish astronomer, was born at Copenhagen  September 25, 1644. When Picard, a French astronomer, visited Denmark in  1671, for the purpose of ascertaining the exact position of  'Uranienburg,' the site of Tycho Brahe's observatory, he made the  acquaintance of Roemer, who was engaged in studying mathematics and  astronomy under Erasmus Bartolinus. Having perceived that the young man  was gifted with no ordinary degree of talent, he secured his services to  assist him in his observations, and, on the conclusion of his labours,  Picard was so much impressed with the ability displayed by Roemer, that  he invited him to accompany him to France. This invitation he accepted,  and took up his residence in the French capital, where he continued to  prosecute his astronomical studies.    In 1675 Roemer communicated to the Academy of Sciences a paper, in which  he announced his discovery of the progressive transmission of light. It  was believed that light travelled instantaneously, but Roemer was able  to demonstrate the inaccuracy of this conclusion, and determined that  light travels through space with a measurable velocity.    By diligently observing the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, Roemer  perceived that sometimes they occurred before, and sometimes after their  predicted times. This irregularity, he discovered, depended upon the  position of the Earth with regard to Jupiter. When the Earth, in  traversing her orbit, moved round to the opposite side of the Sun,  thereby bringing Jupiter into conjunction, an eclipse occurred sixteen  minutes twenty-six seconds later than it did when Jupiter was in  opposition or nearest to the Earth. As there existed an impression that  light travelled instantaneously, it was believed that an eclipse  occurred at the moment it was perceived in the telescope. This, however,  was not so. Roemer, after a long series of observations, concluded that  the discrepancies were due to the fact that light travels with a  measurable velocity, and that it requires a greater length of time,  upwards of sixteen minutes, to traverse the additional distance--the  diameter of the Earth's orbit--which intervenes between the Earth and  Jupiter, when the planet is in conjunction, as compared with the  distance between the Earth and Jupiter, when the latter is in  opposition. This discovery of Roemer's was the means of enabling the  velocity of light to be ascertained, which, according to recent  calculations, is about 187,000 miles a second. As an acknowledgment of  the importance of his communication, Roemer was awarded a seat in the  Academy, and apartments were assigned to him at the Royal Observatory,  where he carried on his astronomical studies.    In 1681 Roemer returned to Denmark, and was appointed Professor of  Mathematics in the University of Copenhagen; he was also entrusted with  the care of the city observatory--a duty which his reputation as an  astronomer eminently qualified him to undertake. The transit  instrument--a mechanism of much importance to astronomers--was invented  by Roemer in 1690; it consists of a telescope fixed to a horizontal  axis, and adjusted so as to revolve in the plane of the meridian. It is  employed in observing the passage of the heavenly bodies across the  observer's meridian. To note accurately by means of the astronomical  clock the exact instant of time at which a celestial body crosses the  centre of the field of view is the essential part of a transit  observation. Small transit instruments are employed for taking the time  and for regulating the observatory clock, but large instruments are  used for delicate and exact observations of Right Ascensions and  Declinations of stars of different magnitudes. Meridian, and altitude  and azimuth circles, are important astronomical appliances, which owe  their existence to the inventive skill of this distinguished astronomer.    Roemer resided for many years at the observatory in the city of  Copenhagen, where he pursued his astronomical studies until the time of  his death, which occurred in 1710. He meritoriously attempted to  determine the parallax of the fixed stars; and it is said that the  astronomical calculations and observations which he left behind him were  so voluminous as to equal in number those made by Tycho Brahe, nearly  all of which perished in a great conflagration that destroyed the  observatory and a large portion of the city of Copenhagen in 1728.    Among other astronomers of this century whose names deserve recording  were Descartes and Gassendi, whose mathematical researches in their  application to astronomy were of much value; Fabricius, Torricelli, and  Maraldi, who by their observations and investigations added many facts  to the general knowledge of the science; and Bayer, to whom belongs the  distinction of having constructed the first star-atlas.    In our own country during this period astronomy was cultivated by a few  enthusiastic men, who devoted their time and talents to promoting the  advancement of the science. It, however, received no recognition as a  subject of study at any of the Universities, and no public observatory  existed in Great Britain.    Though it was not until towards the close of the century that the  attention of all Europe was directed to England in admiration of the  discoveries of the illustrious Newton, yet astronomy had its humble  votaries, and chief among those was a young clergyman of the name of  Horrox.    JEREMIAH HORROX was born at Toxteth, near Liverpool, in 1619--close on  three centuries ago. Little is known of his family. His parents have  been described as persons who occupied a humble position in life, but,  as they were able to give their son a classical education which fitted  him for one of the learned professions, it is probable they were not so  obscure as they have been represented to be.    Having received his early education at Toxteth, Horrox afterwards  proceeded to Cambridge, and was entered as a student at Emmanuel College  on May 18, 1632, when in his fourteenth year.    At the University he devoted himself to the study of classics,  especially Latin, which in those days was the language adopted by men of  learning, when engaged in writing works of a philosophical and  scientific character.    After having remained at Cambridge for three years, Horrox returned to  his native county, and was appointed curate of Hoole, a place about  eight miles distant from Preston. Hoole is described as a narrow  low-lying strip of land consisting largely of moss, and almost converted  into an island by the waters of Martin Mere on the south, and the Ribble  on the north; and, though doubtless an open and favourable situation for  astronomical observation, it could not have been attractive as a place  of residence. Yet it was here on November 24, 1639, that Horrox made his  famous observation of the first recorded transit of Venus, an occurrence  with which his name will be for ever associated.    It was while at Cambridge that Horrox first turned his attention to the  study of astronomy. His love of the sublime, and the captivating  influence exerted on his mind by the contemplation of the heavenly  bodies, induced him to adopt astronomy as a pursuit congenial to his  tastes, and capable of exercising his highest mental powers. Having this  object in view, he applied himself with much earnestness to the study of  mathematics; he had, however, to rely mainly upon his own exertions, for  at that time no branch of physical or mathematical science was taught at  Cambridge, and consequently he obtained no professional instruction.    It was so also with astronomy, which, as a science, was scarcely known  in this country; no regular record of astronomical observations was kept  by any individual observer, and no public observatory existed in England  or in France.    The disadvantages and obstacles which Horrox had to encounter may be  best described by quoting his own words. He writes: 'There were many  hindrances. The abstruse nature of the study, my inexperience and want  of means dispirited me. I was much pained not to have any one to whom I  could look for guidance, or indeed for the sympathy of companionship in  my endeavours, and I was assailed by the languor and weariness which are  inseparable from every great undertaking. What then was to be done? I  could not make the pursuit an easy one, much less increase my fortune,  and least of all imbue others with a love for astronomy; and yet to  complain of philosophy on account of its difficulties would be foolish  and unworthy. I determined, therefore, that the tediousness of study  should be overcome by industry; my poverty--failing a better method--by  patience; and that instead of a master I would use astronomical books.  Armed with these weapons I would contend successfully; and, having heard  of others acquiring knowledge without greater help, I would blush that  any one should be able to do more than I, always remembering that word  of Virgil's--        Totidem nobis animaeque manusque.    Having heard much praise bestowed upon the works of Lansberg, a Flemish  astronomer, Horrox thought it would be to his advantage to procure a  copy of his writings. This he succeeded in obtaining after some  difficulty, and devoted a considerable time to calculating Ephemerides,  based upon the Lansberg Tables, but after making a number of  computations he discovered that they were unreliable and inaccurate.    In the year 1636 Horrox made the acquaintance of William Crabtree, a  devoted astronomer, who lived at Broughton, a suburb of"]]]
