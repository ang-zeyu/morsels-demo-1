Now is the time of transformation to a nymph. As any farther care is  unnecessary, the bees close the cell with a peculiar substance  appropriated for it, and there the worm undergoes both its  metamorphoses.    Though M. Schirach supposes that none but worms three days old are  selected for the royal treatment, I am certain of the contrary; and that  the operation succeeds equally well on those of two days only. I must  be permitted to relate at length the evidence I have of the fact, which  will both demonstrate the reality of common worms being converted into  queens, and the little influence which their age has on the effect of  the operation.    I put some pieces of comb, with some workers eggs, in the cells, and of  the same kind as those already hatched, into a hive deprived of the  queen. The same day several cells were enlarged by the bees, and  converted into royal cells, and the worms supplied with a thick bed of  jelly. Five were then removed from those cells, and five common worms,  which, forty-eight hours before we had seen come from the egg  substituted for them. The bees did not seem aware of the change; they  watched over the new worms the same as over those chosen by themselves;  they continued enlarging the cells, and closed them at the usual time.  When they had hatched on them seven days{H}, we removed the cells to  see the queens that were to be produced. Two were excluded, almost at  the same moment, of the largest size, and well formed in every respect.  The term of the other cells having elapsed, and no queen appearing, we  opened them. In one, was a dead queen, but still a nymph; the other two  were empty. The worms had spun their silk coccoons, but died before  passing into their nymphine state, and presented only a dry skin. I can  conceive nothing more conclusive than this experiment. It demonstrates  that bees have the power of converting the worms of workers into queens;  since they succeeded in procuring queens, by operating on the worms  which we ourselves had selected. It is equally demonstrated, that the  success of the operation does not depend on the worms being three days  old, as those entrusted to the bees were only two. Nor is this all; bees  can convert worms still younger into queens. The following experiment  showed, that when the queen is lost, they destine worms only a few  hours old to replace her.    I was in possession of a hive, which being long deprived of the female,  had neither egg nor worm. I provided a queen of the greatest fertility;  and she immediately began laying in the cells of workers. I removed this  female before being quite three days in the hive, and before any of her  eggs were hatched. The following morning, that is, the fourth day, we  counted fifty minute worms, the oldest scarcely hatched twenty-four  hours. However, several were already destined for queens, which was  proved by the bees depositing around them a much more abundant provision  of food than is supplied to common worms. Next day, the worms were near  forty hours old: the bees had enlarged and converted their hexagonal  cells into cylindrical ones of the greatest capacity. During the  subsequent days, they still laboured at them, and closed them on the  fifth from the origin of the worms. Seven days after sealing of the  first of these royal cells, a queen of the largest size proceeded from  it. She immediately rushed towards the other royal cells, and  endeavoured to destroy their nymphs and worms. In another letter, I  shall recount the effects of her fury.    From these details, you will observe, Sir, that M. Schirach's  experiments had not been sufficiently diversified when he affirmed that  it was essential for the conversion of common worms into queens, they  should be three days old. It is undoubted, that equal success attends  the experiment not only with worms two days old, but also when they have  been only a few hours in existence.    After my researches to corroborate M. Schirach's discovery, I was  desirous of learning whether, as this observer conceives, the only means  which the bees have of procuring a queen, is giving the common worms a  certain kind of aliment, and rearing them in the largest cells. You  will remember, that M. de Reaumur's sentiments are very different: \"The  mother should lay, and she does lay, eggs from which flies fit for being  mothers must in their turn proceed. She does so; and it is evident the  workers know what she is to do. Bees, to which the mother is so  precious, seem to take a peculiar interest in the eggs that one is to  proceed from, and to consider them of the greatest value. They construct  particular cells where they are to be deposited.--The figure of a royal  cell only begun, very much resembles a cup, or, more correctly speaking,  the cup that has lost its acorn.\"    M. de Reaumur, though he did not suspect the possibility of a common  worm being converted into a queen, conceived that the queen bee laid a  particular species of eggs in the royal cells, from which worms should  come that would be queens. According to M. Schirach, on the other hand,  bees always having the power of procuring a queen by bringing up worms  three days old in a particular manner, it would be needless for nature  to grant females the faculty of laying royal eggs. Such prodigality is,  in his eyes, inconsistent with the ordinary laws of nature. Therefore he  maintains, in direct terms, that she does not lay royal eggs in cells  purposely prepared to receive them. He considers the royal cells only as  common ones, enlarged by the bees at the moment when the included worm  is destined for a queen; and adds, that the royal cell would always be  too long for the belly of the mother to reach the bottom.    I admit that M. de Reaumur no where says he has seen the queen lay in  the royal cell. However he did not doubt the fact; and, after all my  observations, I must esteem his opinion just. It is quite certain that,  at particular periods of the year, the bees prepare royal cells; that  the females deposit their eggs in them; and that worms, which shall  became queens, proceed from these eggs.    M. Schirach's objection, concerning the length of the cells, proves  nothing; for the queen does not delay depositing her egg till they are  finished. While only sketched and shaped like the cup of an acorn, she  lays it. This naturalist, dazzled by the brilliancy of his discovery,  saw only part of the truth. He was the first to find out the resource  granted to bees by nature, for repairing the loss of their queen; and  too soon persuaded himself that she had provided no other resource for  the production of females. This error arose from not observing bees in  very flat hives: had he used such as mine, he would have found, on  opening them in spring, a confirmation of M. de Reaumur's opinion. Then,  which is the season of swarming, hives in good condition are governed by  a very fruitful queen: there are royal cells of a figure widely  different from those constructed around the worms destined by the bees  for queens. They are large, attached to the comb by a stalk, and  hanging vertically like stalactites, such, in short, as M. de Reaumur  has described them. The females lay in them before completion. We have  surprised a queen depositing the egg when the cell was only as the cup  of an acorn. The workers never lengthen them until the egg has been  laid. In proportion as the worm grows, they are enlarged, and closed by  the bees when the first transformation approaches. Thus it is true,  that, in spring, the queen deposits in royal cells, previously prepared,  eggs from which flies of her own species are to come. Nature has,  therefore, provided a double means for the multiplication and  conservation of their race.      _PREGNY, 24. August 1791._      FOOTNOTES:    {H} The author's meaning here is obscure.--T.          LETTER V.    _EXPERIMENTS PROVING THAT THERE ARE SOMETIMES COMMON BEES WHICH LAY  FERTILE EGGS._      The singular discovery of M. Riems, concerning the existence of fertile  workers, has appeared very doubtful to you, Sir. You have suspected that  the eggs ascribed to workers by this naturalist had actually been  produced by small queens, which, on account of their size, were  confounded with common bees. But you do not positively insist that M.  Riems is deceived; and, in the letter which you did me the honour to  address to me, you requested me to investigate, by new experiments,  whether there are actually working bees capable of laying fertile eggs.  I have made these experiments with great care: and it is for you to  judge of the confidence they merit.    On the fifth of August 1788, we found the eggs and worms of large drones  in two hives, which had both been some time deprived of queens. We also  observed the rudiments of some royal cells appended like stalactites to  the edges of the combs. The eggs of males were in them. Being perfectly  secure that there was no queen of large size among the bees of these two  hives, the eggs, which daily became more numerous, were evidently laid  either by queens of small size or by fertile workers. I had reason to  believe it was actually by common bees, for we had frequently observed  them inserting the posterior part into the cells; and assuming the same  attitude as the queen when laying. But, not withstanding every exertion,  we had never been able to seize one in this situation, to examine it  more narrowly. And we were unwilling to assert any thing positively,  without having the bees in our hands that had actually laid. Therefore  our observations were continued with equal assiduity, in hopes that, by  some fortunate chance, or in a moment of address, we could secure one of  them. More than a month all our endeavours were abortive.    My assistant then offered to perform an operation that required both  courage and patience, and which I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26477"],[0,"Observations on the Florid Song; Or, Sentiments on the Ancient and Modern (#9)"],[1,"this last pleases the Connoisseurs but for once,  whereas the other, if he does not surprise by the Rareness of his  Productions, will at least gratify your Attention with Variety.[59]    Sec. 6. The most celebrated among the _Ancients_ piqued themselves in  varying every Night their Songs in the Opera's, not only the  _Pathetick_, but also the _Allegro_. The Student, who is not well  grounded, cannot undertake this important Task.    Sec. 7. Without varying the _Airs_, the Knowledge of the Singers could  never be discovered; but from the Nature and Quality of the Variations,  it will be easily discerned in two of the greatest Singers which is the  best.    Sec. 8. Returning from this Digression to the abovementioned, repeating the  first Part of the _Air_ with Variation, the Scholar will therein find  out the Rules for Gracing, and introducing Beauties of his own  Invention: These will teach him, that Time, Taste, and Skill, are  sometimes of but small Advantage to one who is not ready at _extempore_  Embellishments; but they should not allow, that a Superfluity of them  should prejudice the Composition, and confound the Ear.[60]    Sec. 9. Let a Scholar provide himself with a Variety of Graces and  Embellishments, and then let him make use of them with Judgment; for if  he observes, he will find that the most celebrated Singers never make a  Parade of their Talent in a few Songs; well knowing, that if Singers  expose to the Publick all they have in their Shops, they are near  becoming Bankrupts.    Sec. 10. In the Study of _Airs_, as I have before said, one cannot take  Pains enough; for, though certain Things of small Effect may be omitted,  yet how can the Art be called perfect if the Finishing is wanted.    Sec. 11. In _Airs_ accompanied only a Bass, the Application of him who  studies Graces is only subject to Time, and to the Bass; but in those,  that are accompanied with more Instruments, the Singer must be also  attentive to their Movement, in order to avoid the Errors committed by  those who are ignorant of the Contrivance of such Accompaniments.    Sec. 12. To prevent several false Steps in singing the _Airs_, I would  strongly inculcate to a Student, first, never to give over practising in  private, till he is secure of committing no Error in Publick; and next,  that at the first Rehearsal the _Airs_ be sung without any other  Ornaments than those which are very natural; but with a strict  Attention, to examine at the same time in his Mind, where the artificial  ones may be brought in with Propriety in the second; and so from one  Rehearsal to another, always varying for the better, he will by Degrees  become a great Singer.    Sec. 13. The most necessary Study for singing _Airs_ in Perfection, and  what is more difficult than any other, is to seek for what is easy and  natural, as well as of beautiful Inventions. One who has the good  Fortune to unite such two rare Talents, with an agreeable _putting  forth_ of the Voice, is a very happy Singer.    Sec. 14. Let him, who studies under the Disadvantage of an ungrateful  Genius, remember for his Comfort, that singing in Tune, Expression,  _Messa di Voce_, the _Appoggiatura's_, _Shakes_, _Divisions_, and  accompanying himself, are the principal Qualifications; and no such  insuperable Difficulties, but what may be overcome. I know, they are not  sufficient to enable one to sing in Perfection; and that it would be  Weakness to content one's self with only singing tolerably well; but  Embellishments must be called in to their aid, which seldom refuse the  Call, and sometimes come unsought. Study will do the business.    Sec. 15. Let him avoid all those Abuses which have overspread and  established themselves in the _Airs_, if he will preserve Musick in its  Chastity.    Sec. 16. Not only a Scholar, but every Singer ought to forbear  _Caricatura's_, or mimicking others, from the very bad Consequences that  attend them. To make others laugh, hardly gains any one Esteem, but  certainly gives Offence; for no-body likes to appear ridiculous or  ignorant. This Mimicking arises for the most part from a concealed  Ambition to shew their own Merit, at another's Expence; not without a  Mixture of Envy and Spight. Examples shew us but too plainly the great  Injury they are apt to do, and that it well deserves Reproof; for  Mimickry has ruin'd more than one Singer.    Sec. 17. I cannot sufficiently recommend to a Student the exact keeping of  Time; and if I repeat the same in more than one place, there is more  than one Occasion that moves me to it; because, even among the  Professors of the first Rank there are few, but what are almost  insensibly deceived into an Irregularity, or hastening of Time, and  often of both; which though in the Beginning is hardly perceptible, yet  in the Progress of the _Air_ becomes more and more so, and at the last  the Variation, and the Error is discovered.    Sec. 18. If I do not advise a Student to imitate several of the _Moderns_  in their Manner of singing _Airs_, it is from their Neglect of keeping  Time, which ought to be inviolable, and not sacrificed to their beloved  Passages and Divisions.    Sec. 19. The Presumption of some Singers is not to be borne with, who  expect that an whole _Orchestre_ should stop in the midst of a  well-regulated Movement, to wait for their ill-grounded Caprices,  learned by Heart, carried from one Theatre to another, and perhaps  stolen from some applauded female Singer, who had better Luck than  Skill, and whose Errors were excused in regard to her Sex.----Softly,  softly with your Criticism, says one; this, if you do not know it, is  called Singing after the _Mode_----Singing after the _Mode_?----I say,  you are mistaken. The stopping in the _Airs_ at every second and fourth,  and on all the sevenths and sixths of the Bass, was a bad Practice of  the ancient Masters, disapproved fifty Years ago by _Rivani_, called  _Ciecolino_,[61] who with invincible Reasons shewed the proper Places  for Embellishments, without begging Pauses. This Percept was approved by  several eminent Persons, among whom was Signer _Pistochi_,[62] the most  famous of our, and all preceding Times, who has made himself immortal,  by shewing the way of introducing Graces without transgressing against  Time. This Example alone, which is worth a Thousand (O my rever'd  _Moderns_!) should be sufficient to undeceive you. But if this does not  satisfy you, I will add, that _Sifacio_[63] with his mellifluous Voice  embrac'd this Rule; that _Buzzolini_[64] of incomparable Judgment highly  esteemed it: After them _Luigino_[65] with his soft and amorous Stile  followed their Steps; likewise _Signora Boschi_[66] who, to the Glory of  her Sex, has made it appear, that Women, who study, may instruct even  Men of some Note. That _Signora Lotti_,[67] strictly keeping to the  same Rules, with a penetrating Sweetness of Voice, gained the Hearts of  all her Hearers. If Persons of this Rank, and others at present  celebrated all over _Europe_, whom I forbear to name; if all these have  not Authority enough to convince you, that you have no Right to alter  the Time by making Pauses, consider at least, that by this Error in  respect of Time, you often fall into a greater, which is, that the Voice  remains unaccompanied, and deprived of Harmony; and thereby becomes flat  and tiresome to the best Judges. You will perhaps say in Excuse, that  few Auditors have this Discernment, and that there are Numbers of the  others, who blindly applaud every thing that has an Appearance of  Novelty. But whose fault is this? An Audience that applauds what is  blameable, cannot justify your Faults by their Ignorance; it is your  Part to set them right, and, laying aside your ill-grounded Practice,  you should own, that the Liberties you take are against Reason, and an  insult upon all those instrumental Performers that are waiting for you,  who are upon a Level with you, and ought to be subservient only to the  Time. In short, I would have you reflect, that the abovementioned  Precept will always be of Advantage to you; for though under the  neglecting of it, you have a Chance to gain Applause of the Ignorant  only; by observing it, you will justly merit that of the Judicious, and  the Applause will become universal.    Sec. 20. Besides the Errors in keeping Time, there are other Reasons, why a  Student should not imitate the _modern_ Gentlemen in singing _Airs_,  since it plainly appears that all their Application now is to divide  and subdivide in such a Manner, that it is impossible to understand  either Words, Thoughts, or Modulation, or to distinguish one _Air_ from  another, they singing them all so much alike, that, in hearing of one,  you hear a Thousand.----And must the _Mode_ triumph? It was thought, not  many Years since, that in an Opera, one rumbling _Air_, full of  Divisions was sufficient for the most gurgling Singer to spend his  Fire[68]; but the Singers of the present Time are not of that Mind, but  rather, as if they were not satisfied with transforming them all with a  horrible Metamorphosis into so many Divisions, they, like Racers, run  full Speed, with redoubled Violence to their final Cadences, to make  Reparation for the Time they think they have lost during the Course of  the _Air_. In the following Chapter, on the tormented and tortured  Cadences, we shall shortly see the good Taste of the _Mode_; in the mean  while I return to the Abuses and Defects in _Airs_.    Sec. 21. I cannot positively tell, who that _Modern_ Composer, or that  ungrateful Singer was, that had the Heart to banish the delightful,  soothing, _Pathetick_ from _Airs_, as if no longer worthy of their  Commands, after having done them so long and pleasing Service. Whoever  he was, it is certain, he has deprived the Profession of its most  valuable Excellence. Ask all the Musicians in general, what their  Thoughts are of the _Pathetick_, they all agree in the same"]]]
