With this cordial understanding they set about preparing the camp fire,  and the heartiest expressions of friendship were indulged in while the  Puddin' was being passed round. As Bunyip aptly remarked--      'All Fortune's buffets he can surely pardon her,    Who claims as guest our courteous Market Gardener.'    To which Benjimen handsomely replied--      'Still happier he, who meets three Puddin'-owners,    Whose Puddin' is the equal of its donors.'    And, indeed, a very pleasant evening they had round the camp fire.          Fourth Slice      'This is what I call satisfactory,' said Bill, as they sat at breakfast  next morning. 'It's a great relief to the mind to know that them  puddin'-thieves is sufferin' the agonies of remorse, and that our  Puddin' is safe from bein' stolen every ten minutes.'    'You're a bun-headed old optimist,' said the Puddin' rudely.  'Puddin'-thieves never suffer from remorse. They only suffer from  blighted hopes and suppressed activity.'    'Have you no trust in human nature, Albert?' asked Bill, sternly. 'Don't  you know that nothin' gives a man greater remorse than havin' his face  punched, his toes trod on, and eggs rubbed in his hair?'    'I have grave doubts myself,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'as to the sincerity  of their repentance'; and Ben Brandysnap said that, speaking as a market  gardener, his experience of carrot catchers, onion snatchers, pumpkin  pouncers, and cabbage grabbers induced him to hold the opinion that  shooting them with pea-rifles was the only sure way to make them feel  remorse.    In fact, as Sam said--      'The howls and groans of pain and grief,      The accents of remorse,    Extracted from a puddin'-thief      Are all put on, of course.'    'Then, all I can say is,' cried Bill, enraged, 'if there's any more of  this business of puddin'-thieves, disguised as firemen, stealing our  Puddin', and puddin'-thieves, not disguised at all, shovin' bags over  our heads, blow me if I don't give up Puddin'-owning in despair and take  to keepin' carrots for a livin'.'    The Puddin' was so furious at this remark that they were forced to eat  an extra slice all round to pacify him, in spite of which he called Bill  a turnip-headed old carrot-cruncher, and other insulting names. However,  at length they set out on the road, Bill continuing to air some very  despondent remarks.    'For what is the good of havin' a noble trustin' nature,' said he, 'for  every low puddin'-thief in the land to take advantage of? As far as I  can see, the only thing to do is to punch every snout we meet, and  chance the odds it belongs to a puddin'-thief.'    'Come,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'I see you are not your wonted,  good-humoured self this morning. As a means of promoting the general  gaiety, I call on you to sing the _Salt Junk Sarah_ without delay.'    This was immediately effective, and Bill with the greatest heartiness  roared out--      'Ho, aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_      Rollin' round the ocean wide,    The bo'sun's mate, I grieve to state,      He kissed the bo'sun's bride.    [Illustration]      'Rollin' home, rollin' home,    Home across the foam;    The bo'sun rose and punched his nose    And banged him on the dome.'    At about the fifteenth verse they came to the town of Tooraloo, and that  put a stop to the singing, because you can't sing in the public streets  unless you are a musician or a nuisance. The town of Tooraloo is one of  those dozing, snoozing, sausage-shaped places where all the people who  aren't asleep are only half awake, and where dogs pass away their lives  on the footpaths, and you fall over cows when taking your evening  stroll.    [Illustration]    There was a surprise awaiting them at Tooraloo, for the moment they  arrived two persons in bell-toppers and long-tailed coats ran out from  behind a fence and fell flat on their backs in the middle of the road,  yelling 'Help, help! thieves and ruffians are at work!'    The travellers naturally stared with amazement at this peculiar  conduct. The moment the persons in bell-toppers caught sight of them  they sprang up, and striking an attitude expressive of horror, shouted:    'Behold the puddin'-thieves!'    [Illustration]    'Behold the what?' exclaimed Bill.    'Puddin'-thieves,' said one of the bell-topperers. 'For well you know  that that dear Puddin' in your hand has been stolen from its parents and  guardians, which is ourselves.' And the other bell-topperer added, 'Deny  it not, for with that dear Puddin' in your hand your guilt is manifest.'    'Well, if this ain't enough to dumbfound a codfish,' exclaimed Bill.  'Here's two total strangers, disguised as undertakers, actually accusin'  us of stealin' our own Puddin'. Why, it's outside the bounds of  comprehension!'    'It's enough to stagger the senses,' said Sam.    'It's enough to daze the mind with horror,' said Bill.    'Come, come,' said the bell-topperers, 'cease these expressions of  amazement and hand over the stolen Puddin'.'    'What d'yer mean,' exclaimed Bill, 'by calling this a stolen Puddin'?  It's a respectable steak-and-kidney, apple-dumplin', grand digestive  Puddin', and any fellers in pot-hats sayin' it's a stolen Puddin' is  scoundrels of the deepest dye.'    'Never use such words to people wearing bell-toppers,' said one of the  bell-topperers, and the other added, 'With that dear Puddin' gazing up  to heaven, how can you use such words?'    'All very fine, no doubt,' sneered Bill, 'but if you ain't scoundrels of  the deepest dye, remove them hats and prove you ain't afraid to look us  in the eye.'    'No, no,' said the first bell-topperer. 'No removing hats at present on  account of sunstroke, and colds in the head, and doctor's orders. My  doctor said to me only this morning, \"Never remove your hat.\" Those were  his words. \"Let it be your rule through life,\" he said, \"to keep the  head warm, whatever happens.\"'    'No singing \"God save the King\", neither,' said the other bell-topperer.  'Let your conduct be noble, and never sing the National Anthem to people  wearing bell-toppers.'    'In fact,' said the first bell-topperer, 'all we say is, hand over the  Puddin' with a few well-chosen words, and all ill-feeling will be  dropped.'    Bill was so enraged at this suggestion that he dashed his hat on the  ground and kicked it to relieve his feelings. 'Law or no law,' he  shouted, 'I call on all hands to knock them bell-toppers off.'    All hands made a rush for the bell-topperers, who shouted, 'An  Englishman's hat is his castle,' and Top-hats are sacred things'; but  they were overpowered by numbers, and their hats were snatched off. 'THE  PUDDIN'-THIEVES!' shouted the company.    Those bell-toppers had disguised that snooting, snouting scoundrel, the  Possum, and his snoozing, boozing friend the Wombat! There was an  immense uproar over this discovery, Bill and Sam flapping and  snout-bending away at the puddin'-thieves, the puddin'-thieves roaring  for mercy. Ben denounced them as bag snatchers, and Bunyip Bluegum  expressed his indignation in a fine burst of oratory, beginning:    'Base, indeed, must be those scoundrels, who, lost to all sense of  decency and honour, boldly assume the outward semblance of worthy  citizens, and, by the pretentious nature of their appearance, not only  seek the better to impose upon the noble credulity of Puddin'-owners,  but, with dastardly cunning, strike a blow at Society's most sacred  emblem--the pot-hat.'    The uproar brought the Mayor of Tooraloo hastening to the scene,  followed by the local constable. The Mayor was a little, fat,  breathless, beetle-shaped man, who hastened with difficulty owing to his  robe of office being trodden on by the Constable, who ran close behind  him in order to finish eating a banana in secret. He had some more  bananas in a paper bag, and his face was one of those feeble faces that  make one think of eggs and carrots and feathers, if you take my meaning.    'How now, how now!' shouted the Mayor. 'A riot going on here, a  disturbance in the town of Tooraloo. Constable, arrest these rioters and  disturbers.'    'Before going to extremes,' said the Constable, in a tremulous voice,  'my advice to you is, read the Riot Act, and so have all the honour and  glory of stopping the riot yourself.'    [Illustration]    'Unfortunately,' said the Mayor, 'in the haste of departure, I forgot to  bring the Riot Act, so there's nothing else for it; you must have all  the honour and glory of quelling it.'    'The trouble is,' said the Constable, 'that there are far too many  rioters. One would have been quite sufficient. If there had been only  one small undersized rioter, I should have quelled him with the utmost  severity.'    'Constable,' said the Mayor, sternly, 'in the name of His Majesty the  King, I call on you to arrest these rioters without delay.'    'Look here,' said Bill, 'you're labourin' under an error. This ain't a  riot at all. This is merely two puddin'-thieves gettin' a hidin' for  tryin' to steal our Puddin'.'    'Puddin'-thieves!' exclaimed the Mayor. 'Don't tell me that  puddin'-thieves have come to Tooraloo.'      'It staggers me with pain and grief,      I can't believe it's true,    That we should have a puddin'-thief      Or two in Tooraloo.      'It is enough to make one dumb      And very pale in hue    To know that puddin'-thieves should come      To sacred Tooraloo.      'The Law's just anger must appear.      Ho! seize these scoundrels who    Pollute the moral atmosphere      Of rural Tooraloo.'    'We protest against these cruel words,' said the Possum. 'We have been  assaulted and battered and snout-bended by ruffians of the worst  description.'    'How can Your Worship say such things,' said the Wombat, 'and us  a-wearin' bell-toppers before your very eyes.'

Further, they are so much subject to chemical action, and are so  susceptible to their surroundings, that their purity and stability  cannot be maintained for long even if kept airtight; consequently these  ultra-perfect \"imitations\" are of no commercial value whatever as  jewels, even though they may successfully withstand two or three tests.          CHAPTER IX.    PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.      G--HEAT.    Another method of isolating certain stones is by the action of  heat-rays. Remembering our lessons in physics we recall that just as  light-rays may be refracted, absorbed, or reflected, according to the  media through which they are caused to pass, so do heat-rays possess  similar properties. Therefore, if heat-rays are projected through  precious stones, or brought to bear on them in some other manner than by  simple projection, they will be refracted, absorbed, or reflected by the  stones in the same manner as if they were light-rays, and just as  certain stones allow light to pass through their substance, whilst  others are opaque, so do some stones offer no resistance to the passage  of heat-rays, but allow them free movement through the substance,  whilst, in other cases, no passage of heat is possible, the stones being  as opaque to heat as to light. Indeed, the properties of light and heat  are in many ways identical, though the test by heat must in all cases  give place to that by light, which latter is by far of the greater  importance in the judging and isolation of precious stones. It will  readily be understood that in the spectrum the outer or extreme  light-rays at each side are more or less bent or diverted, but those  nearest the centre are comparatively straight, so that, as before  remarked, these central rays are taken as being the standard of  light-value. This divergence or refraction is greater in some stones  than in others, and to it the diamond, as an example, owes its chief  charm. In just such manner do certain stones refract, absorb, or reflect  heat; thus amber, gypsum, and the like, are practically opaque to  heat-rays, in contrast with those of the nature of fluorspar, rock-salt,  &c., which are receptive. Heat passes through these as easily as does  light through a diamond, such stones being classed as diathermal (to  heat through). So that all diathermal stones are easily permeable by  radiant heat, which passes through them exactly as does light through  transparent bodies.    Others, again, are both single and double refracting to heat-rays, and  it is interesting to note the heat-penetrating value as compared with  the refractive indexes of the stone. In the following table will be  found the refractive indexes of a selection of single and double  refractive stones, the figures for \"Light\" being taken from a standard  list. The second column shows the refractive power of heat, applied to  the actual stones, and consisting of a fine pencil blowpipe-flame, one  line (the one twelfth part of an inch) in length in each case. This list  must be taken as approximate, since in many instances the test has been  made on one stone only, without possibility of obtaining an average; and  as stones vary considerably, the figures may be raised or lowered  slightly, or perhaps even changed in class, because in some stones the  least stain or impurity may cause the heat effects to be altered greatly  in their character, and even to become singly or doubly refracting,  opaque or transparent, to heat-rays, according to the nature of the  impurity or to some slight change in the crystalline structure, and so  on.    _Selection of Singly refracting stones._   _Indexes of Rays of_                   LIGHT.

The refractive index of gypsum is 1.54, but heat none, being opaque.    The refractive index of amber is 1.51, but heat none, being opaque.    In some of the specimens the gypsum showed a heat-penetration index of  0.001, and amber of 0.056, but mostly not within the third point. In all  cases the heat-penetration and refraction were shown by electric  recorders. These figures are the average of those obtained from tests  made in some cases on several stones of the same kind, and also on  isolated specimens. Not only does the power of the stone to conduct  heat vary in different stones of the same kind or variety, as already  explained, but there is seen a remarkable difference in value, according  to the spot on which the heat is applied, so that on one stone there is  often seen a conductivity varying between 0.15 to 4.70.    This is owing to the differences of expansion due to the temporary  disturbance of its crystalline structure, brought about by the applied  heat. This will be evident when heat is applied on the axes of the  crystal, on their faces, angles, lines of symmetry, etc., etc., each one  of which gives different results, not only as to value in conductivity,  but a result which varies in a curious degree, out of all proportion to  the heat applied. In many cases a slight diminution in applied heat  gives a greater conductivity, whilst in others a slight rise in the  temperature of the heat destroys its conductivity altogether, and  renders the stone quite opaque to heat-rays.    This anomaly is due entirely to the alteration of crystalline structure,  which, in the one case, is so changed by the diminution in heat as to  cause the crystals to be so placed that they become diathermal, or  transparent to heat-rays; whilst, in the other instance, the crystals  which so arrange themselves as to be diathermal are, by a slightly  increased temperature, somewhat displaced, and reflect, or otherwise  oppose the direct passage of heat-rays, which, at the lower temperature,  obtained free passage.    Thus certain stones become both opaque and diathermal, and as the heat  is caused to vary, so do they show the complete gamut between the two  extremes of total opacity and complete transparency to heat-rays.    For the purpose under consideration, the temperature of the pencil of  heat applied to the stones in their several portions was kept constant.  It will be seen, therefore, that no great reliance can be placed on the  heat test as applied to precious stones.          CHAPTER X.    PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.      H--MAGNETIC AND ELECTRIC INFLUENCES.    The word \"electricity\" is derived from the Greek \"elektron,\" which was  the name for amber, a mineralised resin of extinct pine-trees. It was  well-known to the people of pre-historic times; later to the early  Egyptians, and, at a still later date, we have recorded how Thales--the  Greek philosopher, who lived about the close of the 7th Century B.C.,  and was one of the \"seven wise men\"--discovered the peculiar property  which we call \"electricity\" by rubbing dry silk on amber.    Many stones are capable of exhibiting the same phenomenon, not only by  friction, as in Thales's experiment, but also under the influence of  light, heat, magnetism, chemical action, pressure, etc., and of holding  or retaining this induced or added power for a long or short period,  according to conditions and environment.    If a small pith ball is suspended from a non-conducting support, it  forms a simple and ready means of testing the electricity in a stone.  According to whether the ball is repelled or attracted, so is the  electricity in the stone made evident, though the electroscope gives the  better results. By either of these methods it will be found that some of  the stones are more capable of giving and receiving charges of  electricity than are others; also that some are charged throughout with  one kind only, either positive or negative, whilst others have both,  becoming polarised electrically, having one portion of their substance  negative, the other positive. For instance, amber, as is well known,  produces negative electricity under the influence of friction, but in  almost all cut stones, other than amber, the electricity produced by the  same means is positive, whereas in the _uncut_ stones the electricity is  negative, with the exception of the diamond, in which the electricity is  positive.    When heated, some stones lose their electricity; others develop it,  others have it reversed, the positive becoming negative and vice versa;  others again, when heated, become powerfully magnetic and assume strong  polarity. When electricity develops under the influence of heat, or is  in any way connected with a rising or falling of temperature in a body,  it is called \"pyro-electricity,\" from the Greek word \"pyros,\" fire. The  phenomenon was first discovered in the tourmaline, and it is observed,  speaking broadly, only in those minerals which are hemimorphic, that is,  where the crystals have different planes or faces at their two ends,  examples of which are seen in such crystals as those of axinite,  boracite, smithsonite, topaz, etc., all of which are hemimorphic.
