With these points in our mind as to  the making up of the solution, we can come to the process proper.    The prints require to be well washed and free from hypo before being  placed in the bromide-ferricyanide bleacher, because any hypo in  conjunction with the ferricyanide will form the well-known Farmer's  reducer, and cause patchiness of the prints. It is immaterial whether the  prints are taken direct through the toning process or dried in the  meantime. Some workers contend that the toning process is more regular if  the prints are dried before bleaching. In either case, immersion in the  bleacher will cause the fully developed bromide to disappear, leaving only  a faint brown image behind. In some cases the image is fainter than in  others, the difference appearing to depend chiefly on the developer  employed. Developers with a liability to stain will give prints which do  not bleach out so completely as those made with cleaner working  developers. But, in all cases, two to three minutes' action of the  bleaching solution will be ample; if all pure black is not gone in this  time, it is a sign that the bleach is becoming exhausted. The prints  should be kept constantly on the move whilst in the solution, and turned  over and over to ensure equal action. They are then given quite a brief  rinse in running water--half a minute to a minute--and then transferred to  the sulphide solution, where they should darken to the full brown or sepia  tone in a few seconds. It is well always to leave them here for twice to  three times the period required to give the full tone. A wash of half an  hour will remove the salts left in the film.    Granted that bleacher and sulphide are in proper working order, there is  one further factor in the making of sepia prints which is of vital  importance, and that is the proper preparation of the print itself. A good  sulphide tone presupposes a good black and white bromide. Not only that,  defects in the bromide which may lie latent while the print is untoned  come to light in the sulphide bath. This applies to uneven fixation (due  to omission to keep prints moving in the hypo bath) and fingering of the  surface; while, as regards the original development of the print, making  the best of a wrong exposure will not do when sulphide toning is in view.  A print that is forced by long development will suffer in tone, the result  being colder and less satisfactory as regards vigor. Full exposure, and  development which is complete in the normal time for a perfect black  print, are the conditions for a good sepia tone, and, when a batch of  prints is being put through, it is well to take steps to preserve a  uniform time of development in order to secure an identical tone  throughout.    There are many different formulas for the uranium toning of bromide  prints, and I suppose that most of them have given good results with the  workers who published their methods. Of those which I have tried, however,  none has yielded the results which I have been enabled to obtain from my  own formula--my own in that I arrived at it by patient experimenting. It  may be that this formula is not wholly original with myself. At any rate,  I do not claim anything for it except that it works, with me, better than  others I have tried.    The requirements for toning bromide prints with uranium are: 1 ounce of  uranium nitrate; 1 ounce of potassium ferricyanide (the red crystals); 1/2  pound bottle of acetic acid--c. p. glacial preferred; water; a supply of  blotting paper, to be kept exclusively for this purpose, and a few  absolutely and chemically clean trays.    The expense attached to these toning processes is slight. Uranium nitrate  costs from forty to sixty cents per ounce, and an ounce will last a long  time. Potassium ferricyanide costs about twenty cents per pound, and a  pound is ample for a lifetime. Glacial acetic acid is a little more  costly, but a half-pound bottle will prove a good investment. It is used  also, as the reader will recall, in making acid hypo for acid fixing.    To prepare the toning baths, dissolve the ounce of uranium nitrate in 10  ounces of water. The water should be distilled if this is easily  obtainable, and the solution should be kept in an orange-glass bottle or  an ordinary bottle protected from light by a non-actinic paper wrapping.  Dissolve the ounce of potassium ferricyanide in 10 ounces of water. Keep  this also in an orange-glass bottle, well corked. There are many cautions  about this particular salt, and it has been said that it will not keep in  solution. In my practice I find no difficulty whatever in the use of a  solution six months old, despite the difficulties mentioned in the  text-books.    To tone the bromide prints, first note that the prints should have been  developed and fixed and washed just as usual. It is necessary that prints  to be toned shall contain no trace of hypo. To secure this, the prints  should be specially prepared for toning by being again thoroughly washed,  as any hypo remaining in the print will cause spots and streakiness. With  care at this stage the toning will give clean and bright prints, which  should be as permanent as the original bromide print.    I cannot give the reason why, but, as a general rule, bromide prints tone  better if the print has been dried after washing and rewet just before  toning. There may be a chemical reason for this, but I am inclined to  think that it is a physical one, viz., that the emulsion is softer after  its first washing than after having been dried and wet, so that it allows  toning solution to get into the film more quickly. This naturally results  in more rapid toning, and quick toning does not yield as good prints as a  slower and more gradual building up of the color image.    Having the print ready for toning as here outlined, take 1 dram of the  uranium solution, add 1/2 dram of acetic acid and then 5 ounces of water.  In a separate graduate put 1 dram of ferricyanide solution and 5 ounces of  water. Just before toning, pour these two solutions together into the  third graduate and use immediately. To proceed, lay the rewetted print  face up in a clean tray and flow the freshly made toning bath (the two  solutions combined) over the print. The print and tray must be kept in  motion by gentle rocking during the toning operation. The toning solution  tends to throw a red precipitate as it works. This precipitate should not  be permitted to settle on the face of the print. Some workers tone their  prints face down, but I do not advocate this, as it is important to take  the print from the toning bath at just the right moment, and, as the  toning process is short (six or seven minutes is usually sufficient even  for the deepest red) you need to watch the print all the time. In the  toning operation note that a constant quiet motion of the tray, to keep  the solution moving over the print, is essential to success.    I have already given, in an earlier paragraph, the order in which the  colors come. But that order was for a normal print. Some prints behave  differently, and it is in the control of these unavoidable variations with  different prints that skill and success come. A print of a half-tone  subject against a jet-black background, a portrait, for instance, will  hardly follow the normal order in the appearance of colors. This because  the half-tones will be brown and even red-brown before the toning solution  has changed the dense black deposit of the background at all. If the  toning was stopped at this stage, some very pretty effects in double  toning might result.    From this explanation of the toning process, the discerning reader will  perceive the need for caution in selecting the best kind of a print for  uranium toning. Thus a print which has a bald-headed sky will tone only in  the body of the print, but if there is any tint at all to the sky, it also  will tone, giving an effect not much to be desired except for sunset or  sunrise pictures. If white high-lights are desired in the toned print,  they must be white originally and not the least bit fogged. As  double-toned effects in a print are not usually desirable, those prints  having deep black shadows or dark masses will be avoided. The best kind of  print for this method of toning is one fully exposed and slightly  under-developed, since, when the uranium does take hold of the shadows, it  makes for an increase of contrast.    Experience is the best teacher, and I could not begin to describe in  detail what the reader can himself ascertain from a few experiments. Some  prints needing contrast should be carried far in the toning solution;  others, not needing contrast, will give better results if they are toned  only through the browns, and so on. The reader who can spend a Saturday  afternoon with a few bromide prints, varying in character, will learn more  from his experimenting than I could tell him in many pages. For these  experiments waste or imperfect black prints can be used with practical  economy, the chief object being to watch the progress of toning and  chemical changes.    When the desired tone is reached, remove the print from the toning  solution and wash quickly and well in running water for fifteen minutes.  If washed too long, the color of the print will fade and a dead and  lifeless print will result. If not washed long enough, the yellow of the  ferricyanide will remain in the print, robbing its gradations of  brightness and purity of color and impairing the permanency of the print.    A big advantage in this method of toning is its wonderful adaptability.  There is no hard and fast rule as to the proportion of the chemicals to  the bulk of water used. Try two drams of each of the two solutions; then  three drams of each, but watch that the print does not get beyond you in  toning.

Micaela seeks him out, bringing to him the portrait and the benediction  of his mother, ay, even her kiss, which she gives him with blushes.  His tenderness is gone, however, so far as Micaela is concerned, as  soon as he casts one look into the {37} lustrous eyes of Carmen.  This  passionate creature has involved herself in a quarrel and wounded one  of her companions, a laborer in a cigarette manufactory.  She is to be  taken to prison, but Don Jose lets her off, promising to meet her in  the evening at an inn kept by a man named Lillas Pastia, where they are  to dance the Seguedilla.    In the second act we find them there together, with the whole band of  gipsies.  Don Jose, more and more infatuated by Carmen's charms, is  willing to join the vagabonds, who are at the same time smugglers.  He  accompanies them in a dangerous enterprise of this kind, but no sooner  has he submitted to sacrifice love and honor for the gipsy, than she  begins to tire of his attentions.  Jose has pangs of conscience, he  belongs to another sphere of society and his feelings are of a softer  kind than those of nature's unruly child.  She transfers her affections  to a bull-fighter named Escamillo, another of her suitors, who returns  her love more passionately.  A quarrel ensues between the two rivals.  Escamillo's knife breaks and he is about to be killed by Don Jose, when  Carmen intervenes, holding back his arm.  Don Jose, seeing that she has  duped him, now becomes her deadly foe, filled with undying hatred and  longing for revenge.    Micaela, the tender-hearted maiden, who follows him everywhere like a  guardian-angel, reminds him of his lonely mother, everybody advises him  to let the fickle Carmen alone,--Carmen who never loved the same man  for more than six weeks.  But {38} in vain, till Micaela tells him of  the dying mother, asking incessantly for her son; then at last he  consents to go with her, but not without wild imprecations on his rival  and his faithless love.    In the fourth act we find ourselves in Madrid.  There is to be a  bull-fight; Escamillo, its hero, has invited the whole company to be  present in the circus.    Don Jose appears there too, trying for the last time to regain his  bride.  Carmen, though warned by a fellow gipsy, Frasquita, knows no  fear.  She meets her old lover outside the arena, where he tries hard  to touch her heart.  He kneels at her feet, vowing never to forsake her  and to be one of her own people, but Carmen, though wayward, is neither  a coward nor a liar, and boldly declares that her affections are given  to the bull-fighter, whose triumphs are borne to their ears on the  shouts of the multitude.  Almost beside himself with love and rage Jose  seizes her hand and attempts to drag her away, but she escapes from  him, and throwing the ring, Jose's gift, at his feet, rushes to the  door of the arena.--He overtakes her however and just as the trumpets  announce Escamillo's victory, in a perfect fury of despair he stabs her  through the heart, and the victorious bull-fighter finds his beautiful  bride a corpse.          {39}    CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA.    (SICILIAN RUSTIC CHIVALRY).    Opera in one act by PIETRO MASCAGNI.    Text after Verga's drama of the same name by TARGIONI-TOZZETTI and  MENASCI.      The composer of this very brief opera is a young man, who has had a  most adventurous life notwithstanding his youth.  Son of a baker in  Livorno, he was destined for the bar.  But his love for music made him  enter clandestinely into the Institute Luigi Cherubini, founded by  Alfreddo Soffredini.  When his father heard of this, he confined him in  his chamber, until Pietro's uncle, Steffano, promised to care for him  in future.  Pietro now was enabled to study diligently.  He composed at  the age of 13 years a small Opera \"In filanda\", which was put on the  stage by Soffredini.  Another composition, on Schiller's poem \"An die  Freude\" (To Joy), brought him money and Count Larderell's favor, who  allowed him to study at his expense at the Conservatory at Milan.  But  Mascagni's ambition suffered no restraint, so he suddenly disappeared  from Milan and turned up as musical Director of a wandering troupe.  In  Naples he grew ill, a young lady nursed him, both fell in love and she  became his wife.--Hearing that Sonzogno offered a prize for the best  opera, he procured himself a libretto, and composed the Cavalleria  Rusticana in little more than a week, and--gained the prize.    Henceforward all of course were anxious to {40} hear the music of the  unknown artist, and lo--the opera was an immense success.    It cannot be called a masterpiece, yet it is certainly the offspring of  genius, as fresh and as absolutely original, as it is highly dramatic.    The text, though retaining little of the exquisite beauty of the  original drama, which ought to be read before hearing its fragments in  the opera, assists the music a good deal.  The wave of human passion  sweeps over it, passion as it occurs in daily life, for the composition  belongs to the realistic style, as far as it is based on truth and  reality alone.    The true local color makes it doubly attractive.    The following are the very simple facts of the story, which takes place  in a Sicilian village.    Turridu, a young peasant has loved and wooed Lola before entering  military service.  At his return he finds the flighty damsel married to  the wealthy carrier Alfio, who glories in his pretty wife and treats  her very well.--Turridu tries to console himself with another young  peasant-girl, Santuzza, who loves him ardently, and to whom he has  promised marriage.    The opera only begins at this point.    Lola, the coquette however cannot bear to know, that her former  sweet-heart should love another woman.  She flirts with him, and before  the curtain has been raised after the overture, Turridu's love-song is  heard for Lola, who grants him a rendez-vous in her own house.    This excites Santuzza's wildest jealousy.  She {41} complains to  Turridu's mother, who vainly tries to soothe her.  Then she has a last  interview with Turridu, who is just entering the church.  She  reproaches him first with his treachery, then implores him, not to  forsake her and leave her dishonored.    But Turridu remains deaf to all entreaty, and flings her from him.  At  last, half mad through her lover's stubbornness Santuzza betrays him  and Lola to Alfio, warning the latter, that his wife has proved  false.--After church Alfio and Turridu meet in mother Lucia's  tavern.--Alfio refusing to drink of Turridu's wine, the latter divines  that the husband knows all.  The men and women leave while the two  adversaries after Sicilian custom embrace each-other, Alfio biting  Turridu in the ear, which indicates mortal challenge.--Turridu, deeply  repenting his folly, as well as his falsehood towards poor Santuzza,  recommends her to his mother.--He hurries into the garden, where Alfio  expects him;--a few minutes later his death is announced by the  peasants, and Santuzza falls back in a dead swoon; with which the  curtain closes over the tragedy.--          COSI FAN TUTTE.    Comic Opera in two acts by MOZART.    Text by DA PONTE, newly arranged by L. SCHNEIDER and ED. DEVRIENT.      This opera, though lovely in its way, has never had the success, which  the preceding Figaro and Don Juan attained, and this is due for the  most {42} part to the libretto.  In the original text it really shows  female fickleness, and justifies its title.  But the more Mozart's  music was admired, the less could one be satisfied with such a  libretto.  Schneider and Devrient therefore altered it and in their  version the two female lovers are put to the test, but midway in the  plot it is revealed to them that they are being tried--, with the  result that they feign faithlessness, play the part out and at the  close declare their knowledge, turning the sting against the authors of  the unworthy comedy.  The contents may be told shortly.    Don Fernando and Don Alvar are betrothed to two Andalusian ladies,  Rosaura and Isabella.    They loudly praise their ladies' fidelity, when an old bachelor, named  Onofrio, pretends that their sweet-hearts are not better than other  women and accessible to temptation.  The lovers agree to make the trial  and promise to do everything which Onofrio dictates.  Thereupon they  announce to the ladies, that they are ordered to Havannah with their  regiment, and after a tender leavetaking, they depart to appear again  in another guise, as officers of a strange regiment.  Onofrio has won  the ladies-maid, Dolores, to aid in the furtherance of his schemes and  the officers enter, beginning at once to make love to Isabella and  Rosaura, but each, as was before agreed, to the other's affianced.    Of course the ladies reject them, and the lovers begin to triumph, when  Onofrio prompts them to try another temptation.  The strangers, mad  with {43} love, pretend to drink poison in the young ladies' presence.  Of course these tenderhearted maidens are much aggrieved; they call  Dolores, who bids her mistresses hold the patients in their arms; then  coming disguised as a physician, she gives them an antidote.  By this  clumsy subterfuge they excite the ladies' pity and are nearly  successful in their foolish endeavours, when Dolores, pitying the  cruelly tested women, reveals the whole plot to them.    Isabella and Rosaura now resolve to enter into the play.  They accept  the disguised suitors, and even consent to a marriage.  Dolores appears  in the shape of a notary, without being recognized by the men.  The  marriage-contract is signed, and the lovers disappear to return in  their true characters, full of righteous contempt.  Isabella and  Rosaura make believe to be conscience-stricken, and for a long while  torment and deceive their angry bridegrooms.  But at last they grow  tired of teasing, they present the disguised Dolores,"]]]
