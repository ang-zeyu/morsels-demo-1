The loud cries and clamours of the friends of the afflicted people,      with the advice of the Deputy-governor and many others, prevailed      with me to give a Commission of Oyer and Terminer for discovering      what Witchcraft might be at the bottom, or whether it were not a      possession. The chief Judge in this Commission was the      Deputy-governor, and the rest were persons of the best prudence and      figure that could then be pitched upon. When the Court came to sit      at Salem, in the County of Essex, they convicted more than twenty      persons being guilty of witchcraft, some of the convicted confessed      their guilt; the Court, as I understand, began their proceedings      with the accusations of afflicted persons; and then went upon other      humane evidences to strengthen that. I was, almost the whole time of      the proceeding, abroad in the service of their Majesties, in the      Eastern part of the country, and depended upon the judgment of the      Court, as to a method of proceeding in cases of witchcraft; but when      I came home I found many persons in a strange ferment of      dissatisfaction, which was increased by some hot spirits that blew      up the flame; but on inquiring into the matter I found that the      Devil had taken upon him the name and shape of several persons who      were doubtless innocent, and, to my certain knowledge, of good      reputation; for which cause I have now forbidden the committing of      any more that shall be accused, without unavoidable necessity, and      those that have been committed I would shelter from any proceedings      against them wherein there may be the least suspicion of any wrong      to be done unto the innocent. I would also wait for any particular      directions or commands, if their Majesties please to give me any,      for the fuller ordering this perplexed affair.        \"I have also put a stop to the printing of any discourses one way or      other, that may increase the needless disputes of people upon this      occasion, because I saw a likelihood of kindling an inextinguishable      flame if I should admit any public and open contests; and I have      grieved to see that some, who should have done their Majesties, and      this Province, better service, have so far taken council of passion      as to desire the precipitancy of these matters; these things have      been improved by some to give me many interruptions in their      Majesties service [_which_] has been hereby unhappily clogged, and      the persons, who have made so ill improvement of these matters here,      are seeking to turn it upon me, but I hereby declare, that as soon      as I came from fighting against their Majesties enemies, and      understood what danger some of their innocent subjects might be      exposed to, if the evidence of the afflicted persons only did      prevail, either to the committing, or trying any of them, I did,      before any application was made unto me about it, put a stop to the      proceedings of the Court and they are now stopped till their      Majesties pleasure be known. Sir, I beg pardon for giving you all      this trouble; the reason is because I know my enemies are seeking      to turn it all upon me. Sir,                                            \"I am                                             Your most humble Serv^t                                                          WILLIAM PHIPS.        \"Dated at BOSTON IN NEW ENGLAND, the 14th of Oct^r 1692.        \"MEM^DM        \"That my Lord President be pleased to acquaint his Majesty in      Council with the account received from New England, from Sir W^m      Phips, the Governor there, touching proceedings against several      persons for Witchcraft, as appears by the Governor's letter      concerning those matters.\"    The foregoing document, I repeat, indicates the kind of talk with which  Phips was accosted, when stepping ashore. Exaggerated representations of  the astonishing occurrences at Salem Village burst upon him from all,  whom he would have been likely to meet. The manner in which the Mathers,  through him, had got exclusive possession of the Government of the  Province, probably kept him from mingling freely among, or having much  opportunity to meet, any leading men, outside of his Council and the  party represented therein. Writing in the ensuing October, at the moment  when he had made up his mind to break loose from those who had led him  to the hasty appointment of the Special Court, there is significance in  his language. \"I have grieved to see that some, who should have done  their Majesties, and the Province, better service, have so far taken  counsel of passion, as to desire the precipitancy of these matters.\"  This refers to, and amounts to a condemnation of, the advisers who had  influenced him to the rash measures adopted on his arrival. How rash and  precipitate those measures were I now proceed to show.          V.    THE SPECIAL COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER. HOW IT WAS ESTABLISHED. WHO  RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE CONCENTRATED IN ITS  CHIEF-JUSTICE.      So great was the pressure made upon Sir William Phips, by the wild panic  to which the community had been wrought, that he ordered the persons who  had been committed to prison by the Salem Magistrates, to be put in  irons; but his natural kindness of heart and common sense led him to  relax the unjustifiable severity. Professor Bowen, in his _Life of  Phips_, embraced in Sparks's _American Biography_, [_vii., 81._] says:  \"Sir William seems not to have been in earnest in the proceeding; for  the officers were permitted to evade the order, by putting on the irons  indeed, but taking them off again, immediately.\"    On Tuesday, the twenty-fourth of May, the Council met to consider the  matter specially assigned to that day, namely, the nomination and  appointment of Judicial officers.    The Governor gave notice that he had issued Writs for the election of  Representatives to convene in a General Court, to be held on the eighth  of June.    He also laid before the Council, the assigned business, which was  \"accordingly attended, and divers persons, in the respective Counties  were named, and left for further consideration.\"    On the twenty-fifth of May, the Council being again in session, the  record says: \"a further discourse was had about persons, in the several  Counties, for Justices and other officers, and it was judged advisable  to defer the consideration of fit persons for Judges, until there be an  establishment of Courts of Justice.\"    At the next meeting, on the twenty-seventh of May, it was ordered that  the members of the Council, severally, and their Secretary, should be  Justices of the Peace and Quorum, in the respective Counties where they  reside: a long list, besides, was adopted, appointing the persons named  in it Justices, as also Sheriffs and Coroners; and a SPECIAL COURT OF  OYER AND TERMINER was established for the Counties of Suffolk, Essex,  and Middlesex, consisting of William Stoughton, Chief-justice, John  Richards, Nathaniel Saltonstall, Wait Winthrop, Bartholomew Gedney,  Samuel Sewall, John Hathorne, Jonathan Corwin, and Peter Sargent, any  five of them to be a quorum (Stoughton, Richards, or Gedney to be one of  the five).    When we consider that the subject had been specially assigned on the  seventeenth, and discussed for two days, on the twenty-fourth and  twenty-fifth, to the conclusion that the appointment of Judges ought to  be deferred, \"_until there be an establishment of Courts of  Justice_,\"--which by the Charter, could only be done by the General  Court which was to meet, as the Governor had notified them, in less than  a fortnight--the establishment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, on the  twenty-seventh, must be regarded as very extraordinary. It was  acknowledged to be an unauthorized procedure; the deliberate judgment of  the Council had been expressed against it; and there was no occasion for  such hurry, as the Legislature was so soon to assemble. There must have  been a strong outside pressure, from some quarter, to produce such a  change of front. From Wednesday to Friday, some persons of great  influence must have been hard at work. The reasons assigned, in the  record, for this sudden reversal, by the Council, of its deliberate  decision, are the great number of criminals waiting trial, the thronged  condition of the jails, and \"this hot season of the year,\" on the  twenty-seventh of May! It is further stated, \"there being no  judicatures or Courts of Justice yet established,\" that, therefore, such  an extraordinary step was necessary. It is, indeed, remarkable, that, in  the face of their own recorded convictions of expediency and propriety,  and in disregard of the provisions of the Charter which, a few days  before, they had been sworn to obey, the Council could have been led to  so far \"take counsel of passion,\" as to rush over every barrier to this  precipitate measure.    No specific reference is anywhere made, in the Journals, to Witchcraft;  but the Court was to act upon all cases of felony and other crimes.

The first thing to ensure was that the crew, and especially the  passengers, among whom were a good many women and children, did not  suffer from privation. This had already been ably seen to by the ship's  officers--I merely went round the fleet to sift any genuine complaints  from the discontent natural to the situation in which their own  slackness had placed them. I insisted on hearing only one complaint at a  time, otherwise it would have been pandemonium afloat, for they were  anchored close enough together to converse with each other; vociferous  excuses for their unpunctuality were brushed aside, legitimate requests  for more water or food or condensed milk for the children or more  adequate shelter for the women from the sun were attended to at once,  and our floating village quieted down.    The craft were all much the same type of small dhow or _sanbuk_ which  frequents the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, having little in common with  the big-bellied buggalows which ply with rice and dates between the  Persian Gulf and Indian ports but do not come into the Red Sea. These  were much smaller and saucier-looking craft, some fifty to eighty feet  long, with a turn of speed and raking masts. All were lugger-rigged  with lateen sails, and only the poop and bows were decked, the bulwarks  being heightened with strips of matting to prevent seas from breaking  in-board. Sanitary arrangements were provided for by a box-like  cubby-hole over-hanging the boat's side; inexperienced officers often  take it for a vantage-point to heave the lead from, and only find out  too late after attempting to board there, that things are not always  what they seem.    These little vessels are practically the corsair type of Saracenic  sailing-galley which used to infest the Barbary coast in days gone by.  They do everything different from our occidental methods. For example,  they reef and furl their tall lateens from the peak, and have to send a  man up the long tapering gaff to do it. Their masts rake forward and not  aft, which enables them to swing gaff, sail, and sheet round in front of  the mast when they come about, instead of keeping the sheet aft and  dipping the butt of the gaff with the sail to the other side of the  mast, which would be an impossibility for that rig, as the butt of their  enormous mainyard or gaff is bowsed permanently down in the bows, while  the soaring peak may be nearly a hundred feet above the water. Cooking  was done over charcoal in a kerosene tin half full of sand, and the  \"first-class\" passengers lived under an improvised awning on the poop,  the women's quarters being under that gim-crack structure. All the same,  they are good sea-boats and remarkably fast, especially _on_ a wind,  quite unlike the big-decked buggalows which are built for cargo capacity  and have real cabins aft but sail like a haystack on a barge.    It was inhuman (as well as an infernal nuisance) to keep all those  people sweltering indefinitely at sea; on the other hand, our orders as  to the strict maintenance of the blockade were explicit. The \"owner\" and  I conferred and decided that the situation could be met by transferring  their cargo to the ship and letting the dhows beach. This was referred  and approved by wireless. The job took us some days, as the weather was  rather unfavourable and all the cargoes had to be checked by manifest  with a view to restitution later. Each dhow as she was cleared had to  make for the shore and dismast or beach so that she could not steal out  at night and add to the difficulties of the blockade. None attempted to  evade this order, most carried out both alternatives; perhaps a casual  reminder that they would be within observation and gun-fire of the ship  had some influence on their action.    Hitherto the Turco-Teutonic brand of Holy War had been fairly  successful. The Allied thrust at the Dardanelles and Gallipoli had  failed, the Aden Protectorate was in Turkish hands, we had spent a most  unpleasant Easter in Sinai, and Kut had fallen. Still, the Turks were  soon to realise that a wrongly-invoked _jihad_, like a mishandled  musket, can recoil heavily, and, before the end of May, signs were not  wanting that trouble was brewing for them in the Hejaz.    We were in close touch with the shore through fishing-canoes by day and  secret emissaries by night, who brought us news that some German  \"officers\" had been done to death by Hejazi tribesmen some eight hours'  journey north of Jeddah. They had evidently been first over-powered and  bound, then stabbed in the stomach with the huge two-handed dagger which  the Hejazis use, and finally decapitated, as a Turkish rescue party  which hurried to the spot found their headless and practically  disembowelled corpses with their hands tied behind them. Their effects  came through our hands in due course, and we ascertained that the party  consisted of Lieut.-Commander von Moeller (late of a German gunboat  interned at Tsing-Tao) and five reservists whom he had picked up in  Java. They had landed on the South Arabian coast in March, had visited  Sanaa, the capital of Yamen, and had come up the Arabian coast of the  Red Sea by dhow, keeping well inside the Farsan bank, which is three  hundred miles long and a serious obstacle to patrol work. They had landed  at Konfida, north of the bank, and reached Jeddah by camel on May 5.  Against the advice of the Turks they continued their journey by land,  as they had no chance of eluding our northern patrol at sea. They were  more than a year too late to emulate the gallant (and lucky) \"Odyssey\"  of the Emden's landing-party from Cocos Islands up the Red Sea coast in  the days when our blockade was more lenient and did not interfere with  coasting craft. They hoped to reach Maan and so get on the rail for  Stamboul and back to Germany, as the Sharif would not sanction their  coming to the sacred city of Medina, which is the rail-head for the  Damascus-Hejaz railway. After so staunch a journey they deserved a  better fate. Among their kit was a tattered and blood-stained copy of my  book on the Aden hinterland.[A]    Meanwhile affairs ashore were simmering to boiling-point, and on the  night of June 9 we commenced a bombardment of carefully located Turkish  positions, firing by \"director\" to co-operate with an Arab attack which  was due then but did not materialise till early next morning, and was  then but feebly delivered. We found out later that the rifles and  ammunition we had delivered on the beach some distance south of Jeddah  to the Sharif's agents in support of this attack had been partly  diverted to Mecca and partly hung up by a squabble with their own  camel-men for more cash.    We continued the bombardment on the night of the 11th and were in action  most of the day on the 12th, shelling the Turkish positions north of  Jeddah, which we had located by glass and the co-operation of friendly  fishing-craft who gave us the direction by signal. During the morning  the Hejazis made an abortive and aimless attack along the beach north of  Jeddah, and so masked our own supporting fire, while the Turks gave them  more than they wanted.    By this time the senior ship and others had joined us, and the S.N.O.  approved of my landing with a party of Indian signallers to maintain  closer touch with their operations, provided that Arab headquarters  would guarantee our safety as regards their own people. This they were  unable to do.    The bombardment grew more and more strenuous and searching as other  ships joined in and our knowledge of the Turkish positions became more  accurate. On the 15th it culminated with the arrival of a seaplane  carrier and heavy bombing of the Ottoman trenches which our  flat-trajectory naval guns could hardly reach. The white flag went up  before sunset, and next day there were _pourparlers_ which led to an  unconditional surrender on June 17, 1916.    Mecca had fallen just before, and Taif surrendered soon after, leaving  Medina as the only important town still held by the Turks in the Hejaz.    We began pouring food and munitions into Jeddah as soon as it changed  hands; for the rest of this cruise my ship was a sort of  parcels-delivery van, and when the parcel happens to be an Egyptian  mountain battery its delivery is an undertaking.    My personal contact with the Turks and their ill-omened _jihad_ ended  soon after, as I was invalided from service afloat, but I kept in touch  as an Intelligence-wallah on the beach and followed the rest of it with  interest.    They got Holy War with a vengeance. The Sharif's sons (more especially  the Emirs Feisal and Abdullah, who had been trained at the Stamboul  Military Academy), ably assisted by zealous and skilled British officers  as mine-planters and aerial bombers, harried outlying posts and the  Hejaz railway line north of Medina incessantly.    The Turkish positions at Wejh fell to the Red Sea flotilla, reinforced  by the flagship. I should like to have been there, if only to have seen  the Admiral sail in to the proceedings with a revolver in his fist and  the _elan_ of a sub-lieutenant. The Hejazis failed to synchronise, as  usual, so the Navy dispensed with their support.    On February 24, 1917, Kut was wrested from the Turks again; on March 11  they lost Baghdad; on November 7 their Beersheba-Gaza front was  shattered, and Jerusalem fell on December 9.    Early next year Jericho was captured (February 21), a British column  from Baghdad reached the Caspian in August, and after a final,  victorious British offensive in Palestine the unholy alliance of Turkish  pan-Islamism and German _Kultur_ got its death-blow when Emir Feisal  galloped into Damascus.    The Turks had drawn the blade of _jihad_ from its pan-Islamic scabbard  in vain; its German"]]]
