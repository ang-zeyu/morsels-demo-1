The words are clearer. If in this sense, also, I put anything romantic  before you, pray pay no attention to me.    31. But in the third and last place. The real and proper use of the word  romantic is simply to characterize an improbable or unaccustomed degree  of beauty, sublimity, or virtue. For instance, in matters of history, is  not the Retreat of the Ten Thousand romantic? Is not the death of  Leonidas? of the Horatii? On the other hand, you find nothing romantic,  though much that is monstrous, in the excesses of Tiberius or Commodus.  So again, the battle of Agincourt is romantic, and of Bannockburn,  simply because there was an extraordinary display of human virtue in  both these battles. But there is no romance in the battles of the last  Italian campaign, in which mere feebleness and distrust were on one  side, mere physical force on the other. And even in fiction, the  opponents of virtue, in order to be romantic, must have sublimity  mingled with their vice. It is not the knave, not the ruffian, that are  romantic, but the giant and the dragon; and these, not because they are  false, but because they are majestic. So again as to beauty. You feel  that armor is romantic, because it is a beautiful dress, and you are not  used to it. You do not feel there is anything romantic in the paint and  shells of a Sandwich Islander, for these are not beautiful.    32. So, then, observe, this feeling which you are accustomed to  despise--this secret and poetical enthusiasm in all your hearts, which,  as practical men, you try to restrain--is indeed one of the holiest  parts of your being. It is the instinctive delight in, and admiration  for, sublimity, beauty, and virtue, unusually manifested. And so far  from being a dangerous guide, it is the truest part of your being. It is  even truer than your consciences. A man's conscience may be utterly  perverted and led astray; but so long as the feelings of romance endure  within us, they are unerring,--they are as true to what is right and  lovely as the needle to the north; and all that you have to do is to add  to the enthusiastic sentiment, the majestic judgment--to mingle prudence  and foresight with imagination and admiration, and you have the perfect  human soul. But the great evil of these days is that we try to destroy  the romantic feeling, instead of bridling and directing it. Mark what  Young says of the men of the world:--        \"They, who think nought so strong of the romance,      So rank knight-errant, as a real friend.\"    And they are right. True friendship is romantic, to the men of the  world--true affection is romantic--true religion is romantic; and if you  were to ask me who of all powerful and popular writers in the cause of  error had wrought most harm to their race, I should hesitate in reply  whether to name Voltaire, or Byron, or the last most ingenious and most  venomous of the degraded philosophers of Germany, or rather Cervantes,  for he cast scorn upon the holiest principles of humanity--he, of all  men, most helped forward the terrible change in the soldiers of Europe,  from the spirit of Bayard to the spirit of Bonaparte,[15] helped to  change loyalty into license, protection into plunder, truth into  treachery, chivalry into selfishness; and, since his time, the purest  impulses and the noblest purposes have perhaps been oftener stayed by  the devil, under the name of Quixotism, than under any other base name  or false allegation.    [Footnote 15: I mean no scandal against the _present_ Emperor of the  French, whose truth has, I believe, been as conspicuous in the late  political negotiations, as his decision and prudence have been  throughout the whole course of his government.]    33. Quixotism, or Utopianism; that is another of the devil's pet words.  I believe the quiet admission which we are all of us so ready to make,  that, because things have long been wrong, it is impossible they should  ever be right, is one of the most fatal sources of misery and crime from  which this world suffers. Whenever you hear a man dissuading you from  attempting to do well, on the ground that perfection is \"Utopian;\"  beware of that man. Cast the word out of your dictionary altogether.  There is no need for it. Things are either possible or impossible--you  can easily determine which, in any given state of human science. If the  thing is impossible, you need not trouble yourselves about it; if  possible, try for it. It is very Utopian to hope for the entire doing  away with drunkenness and misery out of the Canongate; but the  Utopianism is not our business--the _work_ is. It is Utopian to hope to  give every child in this kingdom the knowledge of God from its youth;  but the Utopianism is not our business--the _work_ is.    34. I have delayed you by the consideration of these two words, only in  the fear that they might be inaccurately applied to the plans I am going  to lay before you; for, though they were Utopian, and though they were  romantic, they might be none the worse for that. But they are neither.  Utopian they are not; for they are merely a proposal to do again what  has been done for hundreds of years by people whose wealth and power  were as nothing compared to ours;--and romantic they are not, in the  sense of self-sacrificing or eminently virtuous, for they are merely the  proposal to each of you that he should live in a handsomer house than he  does at present, by substituting a cheap mode of ornamentation for a  costly one. You perhaps fancied that architectural beauty was a very  costly thing. Far from it. It is architectural ugliness that is costly.  In the modern system of architecture, decoration is immoderately  expensive, because it is both wrongly placed and wrongly finished. I say  first, wrongly placed. Modern architects decorate the tops of their  buildings. Mediaeval ones decorated the bottom.[16] That makes all the  difference between seeing the ornament and not seeing it. If you bought  some pictures to decorate such a room as this, where would you put them?  On a level with the eye, I suppose, or nearly so? Not on a level with  the chandelier? If you were determined to put them up there, round the  cornice, it would be better for you not to buy them at all. You would  merely throw your money away. And the fact is, that your money _is_  being thrown away continually, by wholesale; and while you are  dissuaded, on the ground of expense, from building beautiful windows and  beautiful doors, you are continually made to pay for ornaments at the  tops of your houses, which, for all the use they are of, might as well  be in the moon. For instance, there is not, on the whole, a more studied  piece of domestic architecture in Edinburgh than the street in which so  many of your excellent physicians live--Rutland Street. I do not know if  you have observed its architecture; but if you will look at it  to-morrow, you will see that a heavy and close balustrade is put all  along the eaves of the houses. Your physicians are not, I suppose, in  the habit of taking academic and meditative walks on the roofs of their  houses; and, if not, this balustrade is altogether useless,--nor merely  useless, for you will find it runs directly in front of all the garret  windows, thus interfering with their light, and blocking out their view  of the street. All that the parapet is meant to do, is to give some  finish to the facades, and the inhabitants have thus been made to pay a  large sum for a piece of mere decoration. Whether it _does_ finish the  facades satisfactorily, or whether the physicians resident in the  street, or their patients, are in anywise edified by the succession of  pear-shaped knobs of stone on their house-tops, I leave them to tell  you; only do not fancy that the design, whatever its success, is an  economical one.    [Footnote 16: For farther confirmation of this statement see the Addenda  at the end of this Lecture.]    35. But this is a very slight waste of money, compared to the constant  habit of putting careful sculpture at the tops of houses. A temple of  luxury has just been built in London for the Army and Navy Club. It cost  L40,000, exclusive of purchase of ground. It has upon it an enormous  quantity of sculpture, representing the gentlemen of the navy as little  boys riding upon dolphins, and the gentlemen of the army--I couldn't see  as what--nor can anybody; for all this sculpture is put up at the top of  the house, where the gutter should be, under the cornice. I know that  this was a Greek way of doing things. I can't help it; that does not  make it a wise one. Greeks might be willing to pay for what they  couldn't see, but Scotchmen and Englishmen shouldn't.    36. Not that the Greeks threw their work away as we do. As far as I know  Greek buildings, their ornamentation, though often bad, is always bold  enough and large enough to be visible in its place. It is not putting  ornament _high_ that is wrong; but it is cutting it too fine to be seen,  wherever it is. This is the great modern mistake: you are actually at  twice the cost which would produce an impressive ornament, to produce  a contemptible one; you increase the price of your buildings by  one-half, in order to mince their decoration into invisibility. Walk  through your streets, and try to make out the ornaments on the upper  parts of your fine buildings--(there are none at the bottoms of them).  Don't do it long, or you will all come home with inflamed eyes, but you  will soon discover that you can see nothing but confusion in ornaments  that have cost you ten or twelve shillings a foot.    [Illustration: PLATE VIII. (Fig. 13., Fig. 14.)]    37. Now, the Gothic builders placed their decoration on a precisely  contrary principle, and on the only rational principle. All their best  and most delicate work they put on the foundation of the building, close  to the spectator, and on the upper parts "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#9)"],[1," their  comrades in the Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the  day birds for miles round. Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious  to kill. The fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of  his head backed by all the strength and weight of his body. If you can  imagine a lance, or a battering ram, or a hammer weighing nearly half  a ton driven by a cool, quiet mind living in the handle of it, you can  roughly imagine what Kaa was like when he fought. A python four or five  feet long can knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest, and  Kaa was thirty feet long, as you know. His first stroke was delivered  into the heart of the crowd round Baloo. It was sent home with shut  mouth in silence, and there was no need of a second. The monkeys  scattered with cries of--\"Kaa! It is Kaa! Run! Run!\"    Generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories  their elders told them of Kaa, the night thief, who could slip along the  branches as quietly as moss grows, and steal away the strongest monkey  that ever lived; of old Kaa, who could make himself look so like a dead  branch or a rotten stump that the wisest were deceived, till the branch  caught them. Kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle,  for none of them knew the limits of his power, none of them could look  him in the face, and none had ever come alive out of his hug. And so  they ran, stammering with terror, to the walls and the roofs of the  houses, and Baloo drew a deep breath of relief. His fur was much thicker  than Bagheera's, but he had suffered sorely in the fight. Then Kaa  opened his mouth for the first time and spoke one long hissing word, and  the far-away monkeys, hurrying to the defense of the Cold Lairs, stayed  where they were, cowering, till the loaded branches bent and crackled  under them. The monkeys on the walls and the empty houses stopped  their cries, and in the stillness that fell upon the city Mowgli heard  Bagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up from the tank. Then the  clamor broke out again. The monkeys leaped higher up the walls. They  clung around the necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they  skipped along the battlements, while Mowgli, dancing in the summerhouse,  put his eye to the screenwork and hooted owl-fashion between his front  teeth, to show his derision and contempt.    \"Get the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no more,\" Bagheera gasped.  \"Let us take the man-cub and go. They may attack again.\"    \"They will not move till I order them. Stay you sssso!\" Kaa hissed, and  the city was silent once more. \"I could not come before, Brother, but I  think I heard thee call\"--this was to Bagheera.    \"I--I may have cried out in the battle,\" Bagheera answered. \"Baloo, art  thou hurt?    \"I am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little  bearlings,\" said Baloo, gravely shaking one leg after the other. \"Wow! I  am sore. Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives--Bagheera and I.\"    \"No matter. Where is the manling?\"    \"Here, in a trap. I cannot climb out,\" cried Mowgli. The curve of the  broken dome was above his head.    \"Take him away. He dances like Mao the Peacock. He will crush our  young,\" said the cobras inside.    \"Hah!\" said Kaa with a chuckle, \"he has friends everywhere, this  manling. Stand back, manling. And hide you, O Poison People. I break  down the wall.\"    Kaa looked carefully till he found a discolored crack in the marble  tracery showing a weak spot, made two or three light taps with his head  to get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his body clear  of the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power smashing blows,  nose-first. The screen-work broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and  rubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between  Baloo and Bagheera--an arm around each big neck.    \"Art thou hurt?\" said Baloo, hugging him softly.    \"I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised. But, oh, they have handled  ye grievously, my Brothers! Ye bleed.\"    \"Others also,\" said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at the  monkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.    \"It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride of all  little frogs!\" whimpered Baloo.    \"Of that we shall judge later,\" said Bagheera, in a dry voice that  Mowgli did not at all like. \"But here is Kaa to whom we owe the battle  and thou owest thy life. Thank him according to our customs, Mowgli.\"    Mowgli turned and saw the great Python's head swaying a foot above his  own.    \"So this is the manling,\" said Kaa. \"Very soft is his skin, and he is  not unlike the Bandar-log. Have a care, manling, that I do not mistake  thee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly changed my coat.\"    \"We be one blood, thou and I,\" Mowgli answered. \"I take my life from  thee tonight. My kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry, O Kaa.\"    \"All thanks, Little Brother,\" said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled. \"And  what may so bold a hunter kill? I ask that I may follow when next he  goes abroad.\"    \"I kill nothing,--I am too little,--but I drive goats toward such as can  use them. When thou art empty come to me and see if I speak the truth.  I have some skill in these [he held out his hands], and if ever thou art  in a trap, I may pay the debt which I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to  Baloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters.\"    \"Well said,\" growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks very  prettily. The Python dropped his head lightly for a minute on Mowgli's  shoulder. \"A brave heart and a courteous tongue,\" said he. \"They shall  carry thee far through the jungle, manling. But now go hence quickly  with thy friends. Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what follows it  is not well that thou shouldst see.\"    The moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys  huddled together on the walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky  fringes of things. Baloo went down to the tank for a drink and Bagheera  began to put his fur in order, as Kaa glided out into the center of the  terrace and brought his jaws together with a ringing snap that drew all  the monkeys' eyes upon him.    \"The moon sets,\" he said. \"Is there yet light enough to see?\"    From the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops--\"We see, O  Kaa.\"    \"Good. Begins now the dance--the Dance of the Hunger of Kaa. Sit still  and watch.\"    He turned twice or thrice in a big circle, weaving his head from right  to left. Then he began making loops and figures of eight with his  body, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided  figures, and coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying, and never  stopping his low humming song. It grew darker and darker, till at last  the dragging, shifting coils disappeared, but they could hear the rustle  of the scales.    Baloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling in their throats,  their neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched and wondered.    \"Bandar-log,\" said the voice of Kaa at last, \"can ye stir foot or hand  without my order? Speak!\"    \"Without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O Kaa!\"    \"Good! Come all one pace nearer to me.\"    The lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo and  Bagheera took one stiff step forward with them.    \"Nearer!\" hissed Kaa, and they all moved again.    Mowgli laid his hands on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away, and the  two great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream.    \"Keep thy hand on my shoulder,\" Bagheera whispered. \"Keep it there, or I  must go back--must go back to Kaa. Aah!\"    \"It is only old Kaa making circles on the dust,\" said Mowgli. \"Let us  go.\" And the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle.    \"Whoof!\" said Baloo, when he stood under the still trees again. \"Never  more will I make an ally of Kaa,\" and he shook himself all over.    \"He knows more than we,\" said Bagheera, trembling. \"In a little time,  had I stayed, I should have walked down his throat.\"    \"Many will walk by that road before the moon rises again,\" said Baloo.  \"He will have good hunting--after his own fashion.\"    \"But what was the meaning of it all?\" said Mowgli, who did not know  anything of a python's powers of fascination. \"I saw no more than a big  snake making foolish circles till the dark came. And his nose was all  sore. Ho! Ho!\"    \"Mowgli,\" said Bagheera angrily, \"his nose was sore on thy account, as  my ears and sides and paws, and Baloo's neck and shoulders are bitten  on thy account. Neither Baloo nor Bagheera will be able to hunt with  pleasure for many days.\"    \"It is nothing,\" said Baloo; \"we have the man-cub again.\"    \"True, but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in  good hunting, in wounds, in hair--I am half plucked along my back--and  last of all, in honor. For, remember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black  Panther, was forced to call upon Kaa for protection, and Baloo and I  were both made stupid as little birds by the Hunger Dance. All this,  man-cub, came of thy playing with the Bandar-log.\"    \"True, it is true,\" said Mowgli sorrowfully. \"I am an evil man-cub, and  my stomach is sad in me.\"    \"Mf! What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?\"    Baloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but he could  not tamper with the Law, so he mumbled: \"Sorrow never stays punishment.  But remember, Bagheera, he is very little.\"    \"I will remember. But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now.  Mowgli, hast thou anything to say?\"    \"Nothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou are wounded. It is just.\"    Bagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther's point of  view (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for a  seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could  wish to avoid. When it was all over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself  up without a word.    \"Now,\" said Bagheera, \"jump on"]]]
