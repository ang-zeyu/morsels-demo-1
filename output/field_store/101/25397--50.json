Most engineers realize this  and accept it as their every-day working creed. Life to them, like the  medium through which they give expression to their ideas, is a matter of  mathematics. Two steps taken in a wrong direction mean an equal number  of steps forcibly retraced--or the whole problem goes wrong. Engineers  rarely take the two steps in the wrong direction. When they do take  wrong steps they are quick to right them. For the code is always before  their eyes.          X    FUTURE OF THE ENGINEER      Just at present the future of the engineer is more richly promising than  it might otherwise have been but for the war. Due to the period of  reconstruction now confronting the world, a work almost wholly that of  the engineering professions, engineers for a period of a decade at least  are destined to be overburdened with projects. Nor will any one branch  be occupied to the exclusion of any other branch or branches. Civil and  structural engineers will, as a matter of course, have the first call;  but with the work of these men well under way--consisting of the  reconstruction of towns and cities--mechanical and electrical men will  necessarily be called upon, with, no doubt, liberal demand for mining  engineers. Each branch will have its place and serve its usefulness in  the order as the reconstruction work itself will fall, with the result  that all branches of the profession will be busily occupied.    Manufacturers have been ready or are getting ready for this  unprecedented promised activity for some little time. Representatives  are flocking abroad on every boat sailing from these shores with schemes  and plans for the rapid upbuilding of devastated Europe. These men, for  the most part, are engineers embracing all branches of the profession,  and each is a man especially well qualified to serve in his branch. In a  way he is a specialist. He may represent a giant structural  organization, or a machine-tool manufacturer, or an electric-lighting  and power concern--any one of the many fields of industrial enterprises  whose product is needed to place demoralized France and Belgium back  upon a productive basis. For when the construction period is over with  there will be need for machine-tools and equipment for operating these  tools, such as engines and boilers and motors, all of which come  properly under the head of engineering productive enterprises.    Engineers--especially American engineers--will be in great demand, as  they are already. Nor will the close of the reconstruction period  witness an abatement of this demand. Having once entered the foreign  field on a large scale, they will of necessity continue to be in demand  not only for the furtherance of industrial projects, but for purposes of  maintaining that which has been installed at their hands. Machinery has  a way of needing periodical overhauling--even the best of machinery--and  this will entail the services of many engineers for long after the  machinery itself has been set up. The services of erecting engines,  operating engineers, supervising engineers--known more properly as  industrial engineers--following, as the need will, close upon the heels  of the constructing and selling men--will keep the many branches alive  and in foreign trade for much more than a decade--or so it seems to the  writer. Other nations may, of course, whip into the field and in time  crowd out the more distant--meaning American--engineers and engineering  products. But I don't think so, because of the acknowledged supremacy of  American engineers in many directions. The war itself taught the world  that we possessed such a supremacy, and the world will be slow to  forget--especially the purchasing side of nations themselves so crippled  of man-power as to be for a generation well-nigh helpless.    So the immediate future of the engineer is richly promising. It is so  rich with promise that a young man could hardly do better than to enter  upon engineering as a life-work, provided he has no particular choice of  careers, and would enter upon an attractive and scopeful one. His work  is already laid out for him. Taking up a course of study leading to the  degree of M.E., or C.E., or E.E., in four years, upon graduating, he can  retrace his way, or the way of his brother, over the battle-fields of  Europe, a constructive rather than a destructive agent now, a  torch-bearer, a pilgrim, a son of democracy once again advancing the  standard in the interests of humanity. He may do this as a mechanical  engineer, as a civil engineer, as an electrical engineer, as a mining  engineer; it matters not. What does matter is that he will be carrying  Old Glory, in spirit if not in the letter, to the distant outposts--the  especial province of the Anglo-Saxon race, anyway, from the beginnings  of this race--and so serving to maintain the respect and affection  already established in these countries by our soldiery. To the writer  the thing looks mighty attractive.    Yet the young engineer's future need not lie in distant places  necessarily. He may stay at home and still have his work cut out for  him. The promised unparalleled activity in the field of engineering on  the other side cannot but enlarge and accentuate the activity on this  side of the water. Plants will be operating full blast to catch up with  the demand imposed by this abnormal activity, and thus the engineer will  perforce bear the burdens of production. He will bear them in all  directions, since industrial activity means engineering activity, and  the work of production cannot go on without him. In the mines, the  mills, the quarries, the foundry, the machine-shop, the pattern-shop,  the drafting-room, the engineering offices, the consulting  divisions--all these, necessitating as they do the employment of one or  more engineers in at least a supervising capacity, will have urgent need  for his services. Constructive work always, he will grow as his work  grows, and because the growth of his work under these abnormal  conditions will be of itself abnormal, his own growth under these  conditions will be abnormal. He will find himself a full engineer before  his rightful time.    Right here it would be well to point out to the young graduate the  importance of getting under a capable engineer. For, much as the writer  dislikes to admit it, there are engineers who are not capable and who  yet occupy positions of great responsibility. The young engineer, fresh  from college and a bit puzzled as to the game as a whole, if he accept a  connection under an engineer, for instance, whose inventive ideas are  impractical, will unwittingly absorb such a man's viewpoint on  construction, and so spoil himself as an engineer for all time to come.  Cases like this are not rare. The writer personally knows of more than  one young man who enlisted under an engineer whose ideas on  administration probably accounted, being as they were good ideas, for  his position of authority over matters not strictly of an administrative  nature. The man wanted to exercise his authority over all things within  his department--not the least of which was machine design--with the  result that the young graduate's normally practical viewpoint on matters  of construction became warped into that of the man over him, and  continued warped for so long as he remained under this man, and  frequently longer, indeed, to the end of his engineering career. The  young engineer must pick his boss as our young men are facetiously  advised to pick their parents. The wrong selection will prove disastrous  to him in after-life.    Which is but an aside--though a very important one. To emulate a  weakling in whatever walk of life, be it painting or writing or  engineering, means to begin wrong. Everybody knows the importance of a  right beginning. It is no less true of the young engineer than of  others.    And what with the example set by Herbert Hoover and other dollar-a-year  men, mostly engineers, in the nation's administrative affairs during the  war, the future of the engineer looks bright in these quarters as well  as in quarters embracing engineering constructive work wholly. The  engineer of the future undoubtedly will take active part in municipal  and national affairs, more likely than not in time entering upon a  political career as a side interest, as the lawyer enters upon it  to-day, within time--so it seems to the writer--members of the  engineering professions occupying positions of great trust, such as  state governorships and--who knows?--the Presidency itself. Certainly  the hand points this way. More and more engineers are coming into  prominence in the public eye, and with every member of the profession so  coming, the respect for men of his profession multiplies among laymen.  It is not too much to say, therefore, that engineers are destined to  fill places of great political power. It is to be hoped that they are.  Whether they do or not, the future at this writing amply promises it,  and so forcibly that it may well be included as existing for the  engineer, as being a part of the future of the engineer.          XI    WHAT CONSTITUTES ENGINEERING SUCCESS      A graduate of Cornell, in the class of '05, after placing away his  diploma where it could not trouble him through suggestiveness, accepted  a position with a large manufacturing concern in western Pennsylvania.  He was twenty-three years old. He went into the shop to get the  practical side of certain theories imposed upon his receptive nature  through four long years of study in a mechanical-engineering course. The  concern manufactured among other things steam-turbines, and this young  man, having demonstrated in school his particular aptitude for  thermodynamics--the study of heat and its units in its application to  engines, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#9)"],[1,"inspired  by genius, and they contented themselves with the task of translators,  undertaken chiefly with a didactic purpose. If they failed to  comprehend the spirit of antiquity, none the less they did something  towards quickening the mind of their own time and rendering the French  language less inadequate to the intellectual needs of a later age.  All that was then known of Livy's history was rendered into French  in 1356 by the friend of Petrarch, Pierre Bercuire. On the suggestion  of Charles V., Nicole Oresme translated from the Latin the Ethics,  Politics, and Economics of Aristotle. It was to please the king that  the aged Raoul de Presles prepared his version of St. Augustine's  _De Civitate Dei_, and Denis Foulechat, with very scanty scholarship,  set himself to render the _Polycraticus_ of John of Salisbury. The  dukes of Bourbon, of Berry, of Burgundy, were also patrons of letters  and encouraged their translators. We cannot say how far this movement  of scholarship might have progressed, if external conditions had  favoured its development. In Jean de Montreuil, secretary of Charles  VI., the devoted student of Cicero, Virgil, and Terence, we have an  example of the true humanist before the Renaissance. But the seeming  dawn was a deceptive aurora; the early humanism of France was clouded  and lost in the tempests of the Hundred Years' War.      III  HISTORY    While the mediaeval historians, compilers, and abbreviators from  records of the past laboured under all the disadvantages of an age  deficient in the critical spirit, and produced works of little value  either for their substance or their literary style, the chroniclers,  who told the story of their own times, Villehardouin, Joinville,  Froissart, Commines, and others, have bequeathed to us, in living  pictures or sagacious studies of events and their causes, some of  the chief treasures of the past. History at first, as composed for  readers who knew no Latin, was comprised in those _chansons de geste_  which happened to deal with matter that was not wholly--or almost  wholly--the creation of fancy. Narrative poems treating of  contemporary events came into existence with the Crusades, but of  these the earliest have not survived, and we possess only rehandlings  of their matter in the style of romance. What happened in France might  be supposed to be known to persons of intelligence; what happened  in the East was new and strange. But England, like the East, was  foreign soil, and the Anglo-Norman trouveres of the eleventh and  twelfth centuries busied themselves with copious narratives in rhyme,  such as Gaimar's _Estorie des Engles_ (1151), Wace's _Brut_ (1155)  and his _Roman de Rou_, which, if of small literary importance, remain  as monuments in the history of the language. The murder of Becket  called forth the admirable life of the saint by Garnier de  Pont-Sainte-Maxence, founded upon original investigations; Henry  II.'s conquest of Ireland was related by an anonymous writer; his  victories over the Scotch (1173-1174) were strikingly described by  Jordan Fantosme. But by far the most remarkable piece of versified  history of this period, remarkable alike for its historical interest  and its literary merit, is the _Vie de Guillaume le Marechal_--William,  Earl of Pembroke, guardian of Henry III.--a poem of nearly twenty  thousand octosyllabic lines by an unknown writer, discovered by M.  Paul Meyer in the library of Sir Thomas Phillipps. \"The masterpiece  of Anglo-Norman historiography,\" writes M. Langlois, \"is assuredly  this anonymous poem, so long forgotten, and henceforth classic.\"    Prose, however, in due time proved itself to be the fitting medium  for historical narrative, and verse was given over to the  extravagances of fantasy. Compilations from the Latin, translations  from the pseudo-Turpin, from Geoffrey of Monmouth, from Sallust,  Suetonius, and Caesar were succeeded by original record and testimony.  GEOFFROY DE VILLEHARDOUIN, born between 1150 and 1164, Marshal of  Champagne in 1191, was appointed eight years later to negotiate with  the Venetians for the transport of the Crusaders to the East. He was  probably a chief agent in the intrigue which diverted the fourth  Crusade from its original destination--the Holy Land--to the assault  upon Constantinople. In the events which followed he had a prominent  part; before the close of 1213 Villehardouin was dead. During his  last years he dictated the unfinished Memoirs known as the _Conquete  de Constantinople_, which relate the story of his life from 1198 to  1207. Villehardouin is the first chronicler who impresses his own  personality on what he wrote: a brave leader, skilful in resource,  he was by no means an enthusiast possessed by the more extravagant  ideas of chivalry; much more was he a politician and diplomatist,  with material interests well in view; not, indeed, devoid of a certain  imaginative wonder at the marvels of the East; not without his moments  of ardour and excitement; deeply impressed with the feeling of feudal  loyalty, the sense of the bond between the suzerain and his vassal;  deeply conscious of the need of discipline in great adventures;  keeping in general a cool head, which could calculate the sum of profit  and loss.    It is probable that Villehardouin knew too much of affairs, and was  too experienced a man of the world to be quite frank as a historian:  we can hardly believe, as he would have us, that the diversion of  the crusading host from its professed objects was unpremeditated;  we can perceive that he composes his narrative so as to form an  apology; his recital has been justly described as, in part at least,  \"un memoire justificatif.\" Nevertheless, there are passages, such  as that which describes the first view of Constantinople, where  Villehardouin's feelings seize upon his imagination, and, as it were,  overpower him. In general he writes with a grave simplicity, sometimes  with baldness, disdaining ornament, little sensible to colour or  grace of style; but by virtue of his clear intelligence and his real  grasp of facts his chronicle acquires a certain literary dignity,  and when his words become vivid we know that it is because he had  seen with inquisitive eyes and felt with genuine ardour. Happily for  students of history, while Villehardouin presents the views of an  aristocrat and a diplomatist, the incidents of the same extraordinary  adventure can be seen, as they struck a simple soldier, in the record  of Robert de Clari, which may serve as a complement and a counterpoise  to the chronicle of his more illustrious contemporary. The unfinished  _Histoire de l'Empereur Henri_, which carries on the narrative of  events for some years subsequent to those related by Villehardouin,  the work of Henri de Valenciennes, is a prose redaction of what had  originally formed a _chanson de geste_.    The versified chronicle or history in the thirteenth century declined  among Anglo-Norman writers, but was continued in Flanders and in  France. Prose translations and adaptations of Latin chronicles,  ancient and modern, were numerous, but the literary value of many  of these is slight. In the Abbey of Saint-Denis a corpus of national  history in Latin had for a long while been in process of formation.  Utilising this corpus and the works from which it was constructed,  one of the monks of the Abbey--perhaps a certain Primat--compiled,  in the second half of the century, a History of France in the  vernacular--the _Grandes Chroniques de Saint-Denis_--with which  later additions were from time to time incorporated, until under  Charles V. the _Grandes Chroniques de France_ attained their  definitive form.[2] Far more interesting as a literary composition  is the little work known as _Recits d'un Menestrel de Reims_ (1260),  a lively, graceful, and often dramatic collection of traditions,  anecdotes, dialogues, made rather for the purposes of popular  entertainment than of formal instruction, and expressing the ideas  of the middle classes on men and things. Forgotten during several  centuries, it remains to us as one of the happiest records of the  mediaeval spirit.    [Footnote 2: The _Chroniques_ were continued by lay writers to the  accession of Louis XI.]    But among the prose narratives to which the thirteenth century gave  birth, the _Histoire de Saint Louis_, by JEAN DE JOINVILLE, stands  pre-eminent. Joinville, born about 1224, possessed of such literary  culture as could be gained at the Court of Thibaut IV. of Champagne,  became a favoured companion of the chivalric and saintly Louis during  his six years' Crusade from 1248 to 1254. The memory of the King  remained the most precious possession of his follower's elder years.  It is probable that soon after 1272 Joinville prepared an  autobiographic fragment, dealing with that period of his youth which  had been his age of adventure. When he was nearly eighty, Jeanne of  Navarre, wife of Philippe le Bel, invited the old seneschal to put  on record the holy words and good deeds of Saint Louis. Joinville  willingly acceded to the request, and incorporating the fragment of  autobiography, in which the writer appeared in close connection with  his King, he had probably almost completed his work at the date of  Queen Jeanne's death (April 2, 1305); to her son, afterwards Louis  X., it was dedicated. His purpose was to recite the pious words and  set forth the Christian virtues of the royal Saint in one book of  the History, and to relate his chivalric actions in the other; but  Joinville had not the art of construction, he suffered from the  feebleness of old age, and he could not perfectly accomplish his  design; in 1317 Joinville died. Deriving some of his materials from  other memoirs of the King, especially those by Geoffroy de Beaulieu  and Guillaume de Nangis, he drew mainly upon his own recollections.
