So the work of faith is a  noble work, a life of labor.          MISCELLANEOUS.      The oft-repeated story that man had his beginning in a low state of  barbarous cannibalism is a groundless assumption.           *       *       *       *       *    What is the difference between getting more out of a thing than there is  in it and creating something out of nothing?           *       *       *       *       *    \"If the religious foundations and sanctions of morality are to be given  up, what is to be substituted for them?\"--_Lord Selborne._           *       *       *       *       *    The Orang and Pongo monkeys, which are classed with those which make the  nearest approach to man, have three vertebra fewer than man.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Live while we may;\" \"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die,\" are  natural corollaries from the teachings of modern as well as ancient  infidels.           *       *       *       *       *    Finding human skeletons with the skeletons of extinct animals  necessitates the bringing of those animals forward, for specimens have  been found in modern times with the flesh upon their bones and food in  their stomachs.           *       *       *       *       *    If all organized animal life was evolved from the moneron, a creature of  one substance, homogeneous, how were creatures of more than one  substance evolved without more being _evolved_ than was _involved_? Let  some of our scientific \"wise-acres\" solve this problem.           *       *       *       *       *    Paul says, \"Things which are seen were not made of things which do  appear.\" Every negative has its affirmative. The affirmative of the  above is this, \"Things which are seen were made of unseen things.\" The  Bible does not teach that anything was made of nothing.           *       *       *       *       *    The Chimpanzee has thirteen pair of movable thoracic ribs. Man has two.  If man lived up in the bushes, like the Chimpanzee and other apes, he  would need more movable ribs so that he might not be ruined by broken  ribs every time he might happen to fall. Is there no evidence of design  here?           *       *       *       *       *    All unbelievers who advocate the idea of spontaneous generation try to  get more out of matter than there was in it, viz: life, sensation,  intelligence and moral nature. Can you get more out of a thing than  there is in it? Is there life without antecedent life, etc.? Unbeliever,  are you mocking the Bible because somebody said the Lord created  something of nothing, and at the same time advocating spontaneous  generation, and thereby professing to get more _evolved_ than was  _involved_?           *       *       *       *       *    The idea that stone implements are an index to man in the beginning of  his existence is an unwarranted conceit; they may point to a degeneracy.  The lost arts are indicative of that which might have been repeated many  times. Stone implements might have been used, as we know they have been,  in times of great civilization. They are an uncertain index of  civilization among the tribes who used them, and no index of the  civilization of other tribes who lived at the same time in other parts  of the earth.           *       *       *       *       *    Professor Huxley says, \"I understand and I respect the meaning of the  word soul, as used by Pagan and Christian philosophers, for what they  believe to be the imperishable seat of human personality, bearing  throughout eternity its burden of woe, or its capacity for adoration and  love.

[Illustration]      Macaroni a la Italienne              2 lbs. ground meat            2 onions            1 large tablespoon butter            1 1/2 tablespoons sugar            salt and pepper to taste            1 large can tomatoes            2 lbs. macaroni            Parmesan cheese            2, 3 or 4 cups water    Put butter in a pan and allow it to melt, add onions and cook until  light brown, not dark. Now add meat and cook slowly, now add sugar, and  seasoning and tomatoes, and as it cooks down add 1 cup of water. Allow  it to cook three hours or longer, adding more water as it needs it. It  will turn dark, almost a mahogany, as it nears the finishing point. When  almost done put macaroni on in plenty of boiling salt water and cook  almost twenty minutes. Do not allow it to cook entirely. When done drain  off water. Now take baking dish, and put a layer of macaroni on bottom,  now a layer of parmesan cheese, now a layer of the tomato and meat  sauce, now a layer of cheese and repeat with macaroni, cheese, sauce,  etc., until the top is reached. Put on a generous layer of sauce and  cheese and allow it to bake about a half hour in a medium oven, being  careful that it is not too hot.    Regarding how much water to add must be determined by cook. Some times  it boils more rapidly. The sauce must not be too thin.    To serve with Macaroni Italienne the following is very fine.    Have the butcher cut a 2 pound round steak as thin as possible and  prepare the following way:              1 generous cup grated bread crumbs            2 anchovies, cut fine            1/2 tablespoon parsley, cut fine            3 eggs boiled hard            1/2 tablespoon parmesan cheese            seasoning to taste    Grate the bread, cut anchovies and parsley fine. Mix all with seasoning  and cheese and spread on steak. Now place the eggs which have been  boiled hard, peel, and allow to remain whole on top of bread crumbs,  etc. Place at equal distance from each other, and roll up and bind with  skewers or cord. Put this into the pot with the tomato and meat sauce  and allow it to cook until the sauce is done, at which time the meat  roll will also be ready to serve. Place the roll on a dish and cut in  slices.    This, with a light salad, is sufficient for a dinner.      Rice With Cheese    Cook a cup of rice in rapidly boiling, salted water until almost ready  for the table. Drain, mix with a pint of white sauce, pour into a baking  dish, cover with slices of cheese, and bake in a moderate oven twenty  minutes.    The white sauce may also be flavored with cheese.      Rice With Nuts    Prepare rice as above, and mingle with white sauce; add half a cup of  chopped nuts--pecans or hickory nuts preferred; sprinkle a few chopped  nuts over surface, and brown in quick oven.

Carrot Croquettes    Boil four large carrots until tender; drain and rub through a sieve, add  one cupful of thick white sauce, mix well and season to taste. When  cold, shape into croquettes, and fry same as other croquettes.      Potato Balls    Two soup plates of grated potatoes which have been boiled in the skins  the day before. Add four tablespoons flour or bread crumbs, a little  nutmeg and salt, one-half cup of melted butter and the yolks of four  eggs and one cupful croutons (fried bread--in butter--cut into small  cubes).    Mix together, then add the beaten whites of the eggs. Mix well and form  into balls, then boil in boiling salt water about fifteen or twenty  minutes. Serve with bacon cut into small squares on top.    To be eaten with stewed dried fruits cooked together--prunes, apricots,  apples.                                                  MRS. RAYMOND ROBINS.      Vegetable Medley, Baked    To take the place of the roast on a meatless menu, try the following:    Soak and boil one-half pint of dried beans to make a pint of pulp,  putting it through a colander to remove the skins. Take small can of  tomato soup and to this allow a pint of nuts ground, two raw eggs, half  a cup of flour browned, one small onion minced and a tablespoon of  parsley, also minced. Season to taste with sage, sweet marjoram, celery  salt, pepper and paprika and mix the whole well, stirring in half a cup  of sweet milk. Put into a well-greased baking tin and brown for 20  minutes in a quick oven. Serve hot on a flat dish as you would a roast  with brown gravy or tomato sauce.                Women cannot make a worse mess of voting than men            have. They will make mistakes at first. That is to            be expected. It will not be their fault, but the            fault of the men who have withheld from them what            they should have had before this. But eventually            they will get their bearings, and will use the            ballot to better effect than men have used it.              Whatever the outcome, it will be better to have            intelligent women voting than the illiterates and            incompetents who have now the right to the vote            because they are men. We need to tighten up at one            end of the voting question and broaden out at the            other. We should take from the ignorant, worthless            and unfit men who possess it, that right of            suffrage which they do not know how to use. We            should give to the thousands of intelligent women            of the country the right of suffrage which should            be theirs.

[Illustration]                The waste of good materials, the vexation that            frequently attends such mismanagement and the            curses not unfrequently bestowed on cooks with the            usual reflection, that whereas God sends good            meat, the devil sends cooks.           E. Smith.          SAVORIES      Hot savory and cold salad are always to be recommended--some suggestions  that are worth remembering.    A hot savory and a cold salad make a good combination for the summer  luncheon, and the savory is a useful dish for the disposition of  left-over scraps of meat, fish, etc.    The foundation of a savory is usually a triangle or a finger of buttered  brown bread toast, or fried bread, pastry or biscuit. The filling may be  varied indefinitely, and its arrangement depends upon available  materials.    Here are a few suggestions for the use of materials common to all  households.                He that eats well and drinks well, should do his            duty well.      Tomato Toast    Half an ounce of butter, two ounces of grated cheese, one tablespoon of  tomato; paprika. Melt the butter and add the tomato (either canned or  fresh stewed), then the grated cheese; sprinkle with paprika and heat on  the stove. Cut bread into rounds or small squares, fry and pour over  each slice the hot tomato mixture.      Ham Toast    Mince a little left-over boiled ham very finely. Warm it in a pan with a  piece of butter. Add a little pepper and paprika. When very hot pile on  hot buttered toast. Any left-over scraps of fish or meat may be used up  in a similar way, and make an excellent savory to serve with a green  salad.      Cheese Savories    Butter slices of bread and sprinkle over them a mixture of grated cheese  and paprika. Set them in a pan and place the pan in the oven, leaving it  there until the bread is colored, and the cheese set. Serve very hot.      Sardine Savories    Sardines, one hard boiled egg, brown bread, parsley. Cut the brown bread  into strips and butter them. Remove the skin and the bones from the  sardines and lay one fish on each finger of the bread. Chop the white of  the egg into fine pieces and rub the yolk through a strainer. Chop the  parsley very fine and decorate each sardine with layers of the white,  the yolk and the chopped parsley. Season with pepper and salt.      Oyster Savories    These make a more substantial dish, and are delicious when served with a  celery salad: Six oysters, six slices of bacon, fried bread, seasoning.  Cut very thin strips of bacon that can be purchased already shaved is  best for the purpose. Season the oysters with pepper and salt, and wrap  each in a slice of the bacon, pinning it together with a wooden splint  (a toothpick). Place each oyster on a round of toast or of fried bread,  and cook in the oven for about five minutes. Serve very hot, and  sprinkle with pepper.      Savory Rice and Tomato    Fry until crisp a quarter pound of salt pork. Put into the pan with it a  medium-sized onion, minced fine and brown. All this to three cupfuls of  boiled rice; mix in two green peppers seeded and chopped, and a cupful  of tomato sauce. Season all to taste with salt and pepper, turn into a  buttered baking dish, sprinkle with fine breadcrumbs and small pieces of  butter. Brown.      Stuffed Celery    A most delicious relish is made with Roquefort cheese, the size of a  walnut, rubbed in with equal quantity of butter, moistened with sherry  (lemon juice will serve if sherry be not available), and seasoned with  salt, pepper, celery salt, and paprika; then squeezed into the troughs  of a dozen slender, succulent sticks of celery. This is a very  appropriate prelude to a dinner of roast duck.                                                  JACK LONDON.
