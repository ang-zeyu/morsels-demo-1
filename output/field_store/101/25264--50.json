This he did, and retired to his own kingdom.    \"The upper class, and all those who possessed wisdom enough to know  how great was the power of Rome, still strove for peace. But the  people were beyond control. They seized the fortress of Masada--a  very strong place near the Dead Sea--and put the Roman garrison to  the sword. But what was even worse, Eleazar--son of Ananias, the  chief priest--persuaded the priests to reject the offerings  regularly made, in the name of the emperor, to the God of the  Hebrews; and to make a regulation that, from that time, no  foreigner should be allowed to sacrifice in the Temple.    \"The chief priests, with the heads of the Pharisees, addressed the  people in the quadrangle of the Temple, before the eastern gate. I,  myself, was one of those who spoke. We told them that the Temple  had long benefited by the splendid gifts of strangers; and that it  was not only inhospitable, but impious, to preclude them from  offering victims, and worshiping God, there. We, who were learned  in the law, showed them that it was an ancient and immemorial usage  to receive the offerings of strangers; and that this refusal to  accept the Roman gifts was nothing short of a declaration of war.    \"But all we could do, or say, availed nothing. The influence of  Eleazar was too great. A madness had seized the people, and they  rejected all our words; but the party of peace made one more  effort. They sent a deputation--headed by Simon, son of Ananias--to  Florus, and another to Agrippa, praying them to march upon  Jerusalem, and reassert their authority, before it was too late.  Florus made no reply, for things were going just as he wished; but  Agrippa, anxious to preserve the city, sent three thousand  horsemen, commanded by Darius and Philip. When these troops  arrived, the party of peace took possession of the upper city;  while Eleazar and the war party held the Temple.    \"For a week, fighting went on between the two parties. Then, at the  festival of the Wood Carrying, great numbers of the poorer people  were allowed by the party of the chief priest to pass through their  lines; and go, as usual, to the Temple. When there, these joined  the party of Eleazar, and a great attack was made on the upper  city. The troops of Darius and Philip gave way. The house of  Ananias--the high priest--and the palaces of Agrippa and Bernice  were burned, and also the public archives. Here all the bonds of  the debtors were registered and, thus, at one blow the power of the  rich over the poor was destroyed. Ananias himself, and a few  others, escaped into the upper towers of the palace, which they  held.    \"The next day, Eleazar's party attacked the fortress of Antonia,  which was feebly garrisoned and, after two days' fighting, captured  it, and slew the garrison. Manahem, the son of Judas the Zealot,  arrived two days later, while the people were besieging the palace.  He was accepted as general, by them; and took charge of the siege.  Having mined under one of the towers, they brought it to the  ground, and the garrison asked for terms. Free passage was granted  to the troops of Agrippa, and the Jews; but none was granted to the  Roman soldiers, who were few in number and retreated to the three  great towers, Hippicus, Phasaelus, and Mariamne.    \"The palace was entered, and Ananias and Hezekiah--his  brother--were found in hiding, and put to death. Manahem now  assumed the state of a king; but Eleazar, unwilling that, after  having led the enterprise, the fruits should be gathered by  another, stirred up the people against him, and he was slain. The  three towers were now besieged; and Metilius--the Roman  commander--finding he could no longer hold out, agreed to  surrender, on the condition that his men should deliver up their  arms, and be allowed to march away, unharmed.    \"The terms were accepted and ratified but, as soon as the Roman  soldiers marched out, and laid down their arms, Eleazar and his  followers fell upon them and slew them; Metilius himself being,  alone, spared. After this terrible massacre, a sadness fell on the  city. All felt that there was no longer any hope of making  conditions with Rome. We had placed ourselves beyond the pale of  forgiveness. It was war, to the death, with Rome.    \"Up to this time, as I have told you, I was one of those who had  labored to maintain peace. I had fought in the palace, by the side  of Ananias; and had left it only when the troops, and we of their  party, were permitted to march out when it surrendered. But, from  this time, I took another part. All hope of peace, of concessions,  or of conditions was at an end. There remained nothing now but to  fight and, as the vengeance of Rome would fall on the whole Jewish  people, it was for the whole Jewish people to unite in the struggle  for existence.    \"On the very day and hour in which the Romans were put to death,  retribution began to fall upon the nation; for the Greeks of  Caesarea rose suddenly, and massacred the Jews. Twenty thousand  were slain, in a single day. The news of these two massacres drove  the whole people to madness. They rose throughout the land, laid  waste the country all round the cities of Syria--Philadelphia,  Sebonitis, Gerasa, Pella, and Scythopolis--and burned and destroyed  many places.    \"The Syrians, in turn, fell upon the Jewish inhabitants of all  their towns; and a frightful carnage, everywhere, took place. Then,  our people made an inroad into the domains of Scythopolis but,  though the Jewish inhabitants there joined the Syrians in defending  their territory, the Syrians doubted their fidelity and, falling  upon them in the night, slew them all, and seized their property.  Thirteen thousand perished here. In many other cities, the same  things were done; in Ascalon, two thousand five hundred were put to  the sword; in Ptolemais, two thousand were killed. The land was  deluged with blood, and despair fell upon all.    \"Even in Alexandria, our countrymen suffered. Breaking out into a  quarrel with the Greeks, a tumult arose; and Tiberias Alexander,  the governor--by faith a Jew--tried to pacify matters; but the  madness which had seized the people, here, had fallen also upon the  Jews of Alexandria. They heaped abuse upon Alexander, who was  forced to send the troops against them. The Jews fought, but  vainly; and fifty thousand men, women, and children fell.    \"While blood was flowing over the land, Cestius Gallus--the  prefect--was preparing for invasion. He had with him the Twelfth  Legion, forty-two hundred strong; two thousand picked men, taken  from the other legions; six cohorts of foot, about twenty-five  hundred; and four troops of horse, twelve hundred. Of allies he  had, from Antiochus, two thousand horse and three thousand foot;  from Agrippa, one thousand horse and three thousand foot; Sohemus  joined him with four thousand men--a third of whom were horse, the  rest archers. Thus he had ten thousand Roman troops, and thirteen  thousand allies; besides many volunteers, who joined him from the  Syrian cities.    \"After burning and pillaging Zebulon, and wasting the district,  Cestius returned to Ptolemais, and then advanced to Caesarea. He  sent forward a part of his army to Joppa. The city was open, and no  resistance was offered; nevertheless, the Romans slew all, to the  number of eight thousand five hundred. The cities of Galilee opened  their gates, without resistance, and Cestius advanced against  Jerusalem.    \"When he arrived within six miles of the town, the Jews poured out;  and fell upon them with such fury that, if the horse and light  troops had not made a circuit, and fallen upon us in the rear, I  believe we should have destroyed the whole army. But we were forced  to fall back, having killed over five hundred. As the Romans moved  forward, Simon--son of Gioras--with a band, pressed them closely in  rear; and slew many, and carried off numbers of their beasts of  burden.    \"Agrippa now tried, once more, to make peace, and sent a deputation  to persuade us to surrender--offering, in the name of Cestius,  pardon for all that had passed--but Eleazar's party, fearing the  people might listen to him, fell upon the deputation, slew some,  and drove the others back.    \"Cestius advanced within a mile of Jerusalem and--after waiting  three days, in hopes that the Jews would surrender, and knowing  that many of the chief persons were friendly to him--he advanced to  the attack, took the suburb of Bezetha, and encamped opposite the  palace in the upper city. The people discovered that Ananias and  his friends had agreed to open the gates; and so slew them, and  threw the bodies over the wall. The Romans for five days attacked  and, on the sixth, Cestius, with the flower of his army made an  assault; but the people fought bravely and, disregarding the  flights of arrows which the archers shot against them, held the  walls, and poured missiles of all kinds upon the enemy; until at  last, just as it seemed to all that the Romans would succeed in  mining the walls, and firing the gates, Cestius called off his  troops.    \"Had he not done so, he would speedily have taken the city; for the  peace party were on the point of seizing one of the gates, and  opening it. I no longer belonged to this party; for it seemed to me  that it was altogether too late, now, to make terms; nor could we  expect that the Romans would keep to their conditions, after we had  set them the example of breaking faith.    \"Cestius fell back to his camp, a mile distant, but he had no rest  there. Exultant at seeing a retreat from their walls, all the  people poured out, and fell upon the Romans with fury.    \"The next morning Cestius began to retreat; but we swarmed around  him, pressing upon his rear, and dashing down from the hills upon  his flanks, giving him no rest.

LIBRARIES.      The passion for forming vast collections of books has necessarily  existed in all periods of human curiosity; but long it required regal  munificence to found a national library. It is only since the art of  multiplying the productions of the mind has been discovered, that men of  letters themselves have been enabled to rival this imperial and  patriotic honour. The taste for books, so rare before the fifteenth  century, has gradually become general only within these four hundred  years: in that small space of time the public mind of Europe has been  created.    Of LIBRARIES, the following anecdotes seem most interesting, as they  mark either the affection, or the veneration, which civilised men have  ever felt for these perennial repositories of their minds. The first  national library founded in Egypt seemed to have been placed under the  protection of the divinities, for their statues magnificently adorned  this temple, dedicated at once to religion and to literature. It was  still further embellished by a well-known inscription, for ever grateful  to the votary of literature; on the front was engraven,--\"The  nourishment of the soul;\" or, according to Diodorus, \"The medicine of  the mind.\"    The Egyptian Ptolemies founded the vast library of Alexandria, which was  afterwards the emulative labour of rival monarchs; the founder infused a  soul into the vast body he was creating, by his choice of the librarian,  Demetrius Phalereus, whose skilful industry amassed from all nations  their choicest productions. Without such a librarian, a national library  would be little more than a literary chaos; his well exercised memory  and critical judgment are its best catalogue. One of the Ptolemies  refused supplying the famished Athenians with wheat, until they  presented him with the original manuscripts of AEschylus, Sophocles, and  Euripides; and in returning copies of these autographs, he allowed them  to retain the fifteen talents which he had pledged with them as a  princely security.    When tyrants, or usurpers, have possessed sense as well as courage, they  have proved the most ardent patrons of literature; they know it is their  interest to turn aside the public mind from political speculations, and  to afford their subjects the inexhaustible occupations of curiosity, and  the consoling pleasures of the imagination. Thus Pisistratus is said to  have been among the earliest of the Greeks, who projected an immense  collection of the works of the learned, and is supposed to have been the  collector of the scattered works, which passed under the name of Homer.    The Romans, after six centuries of gradual dominion, must have possessed  the vast and diversified collections of the writings of the nations they  conquered: among the most valued spoils of their victories, we know that  manuscripts were considered as more precious than vases of gold. Paulus  Emilius, after the defeat of Perseus, king of Macedon, brought to Rome a  great number which he had amassed in Greece, and which he now  distributed among his sons, or presented to the Roman people. Sylla  followed his example. Alter the siege of Athens, he discovered an entire  library in the temple of Apollo, which having carried to Rome, he  appears to have been the founder of the first Roman public library.  After the taking of Carthage, the Roman senate rewarded the family of  Regulus with the books found in that city. A library was a national  gift, and the most honourable they could bestow. From the intercourse of  the Romans with the Greeks, the passion for forming libraries rapidly  increased, and individuals began to pride themselves on their private  collections.    Of many illustrious Romans, their magnificent taste in their _libraries_  has been recorded. Asinius Pollio, Crassus, Caesar, and Cicero, have,  among others, been celebrated for their literary splendor. Lucullus,  whose incredible opulence exhausted itself on more than imperial  luxuries, more honourably distinguished himself by his vast collections  of books, and the happy use he made of them by the liberal access he  allowed the learned. \"It was a library,\" says Plutarch, \"whose walks,  galleries, and cabinets, were open to all visitors; and the ingenious  Greeks, when at leisure, resorted to this abode of the Muses to hold  literary conversations, in which Lucullus himself loved to join.\" This  library enlarged by others, Julius Caesar once proposed to open for the  public, having chosen the erudite Varro for its librarian; but the  daggers of Brutus and his party prevented the meditated projects of  Caesar. In this museum, Cicero frequently pursued his studies, during the  time his friend Faustus had the charge of it; which he describes to  Atticus in his 4th Book, Epist. 9. Amidst his public occupations and his  private studies, either of them sufficient to have immortalised one man,  we are astonished at the minute attention Cicero paid to the formation  of his libraries and his cabinets of antiquities.    The emperors were ambitious, at length, to give _their names_ to the  _libraries_ they founded; they did not consider the purple as their  chief ornament. Augustus was himself an author; and to one of those  sumptuous buildings, called _Thermae_, ornamented with porticos,  galleries, and statues, with shady walks, and refreshing baths,  testified his love of literature by adding a magnificent library. One of  these libraries he fondly called by the name of his sister Octavia; and  the other, the temple of Apollo, became the haunt of the poets, as  Horace, Juvenal, and Persius have commemorated. The successors of  Augustus imitated his example, and even Tiberius had an imperial  library, chiefly consisting of works concerning the empire and the acts  of its sovereigns. These Trajan augmented by the Ulpian library,  denominated from his family name. In a word, we have accounts of the  rich ornaments the ancients bestowed on their libraries; of their floors  paved with marble, their walls covered with glass and ivory, and their  shelves and desks of ebony and cedar.    The first _public library_ in Italy was founded by a person of no  considerable fortune: his credit, his frugality, and fortitude, were  indeed equal to a treasury. Nicholas Niccoli, the son of a merchant,  after the death of his father relinquished the beaten roads of gain, and  devoted his soul to study, and his fortune to assist students. At his  death, he left his library to the public, but his debts exceeding his  effects, the princely generosity of Cosmo de' Medici realised the  intention of its former possessor, and afterwards enriched it by the  addition of an apartment, in which he placed the Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,  Chaldaic, and Indian MSS. The intrepid spirit of Nicholas V. laid the  foundations of the Vatican; the affection of Cardinal Bessarion for his  country first gave Venice the rudiments of a public library; and to Sir  T. Bodley we owe the invaluable one of Oxford. Sir Robert Cotton, Sir  Hans Sloane, Dr. Birch, Mr. Cracherode, Mr. Douce, and others of this  race of lovers of books, have all contributed to form these literary  treasures, which our nation owe to the enthusiasm of individuals, who  have consecrated their fortunes and their days to this great public  object; or, which in the result produces the same public good, the  collections of such men have been frequently purchased on their deaths,  by government, and thus have been preserved entire in our national  collections.[5]    LITERATURE, like virtue, is often its own reward, and the enthusiasm  some experience in the permanent enjoyments of a vast library has far  outweighed the neglect or the calumny of the world, which some of its  votaries have received. From the time that Cicero poured forth his  feelings in his oration for the poet Archias, innumerable are the  testimonies of men of letters of the pleasurable delirium of their  researches. Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, and Chancellor of England  so early as 1341, perhaps raised the first private library in our  country. He purchased thirty or forty volumes of the Abbot of St. Albans  for fifty pounds' weight of silver. He was so enamoured of his large  collection, that he expressly composed a treatise on his love of books,  under the title of _Philobiblion_; and which has been recently  translated.[6]    He who passes much of his time amid such vast resources, and does not  aspire to make some small addition to his library, were it only by a  critical catalogue, must indeed be not more animated than a leaden  Mercury. He must be as indolent as that animal called the Sloth, who  perishes on the tree he climbs,"]]]
