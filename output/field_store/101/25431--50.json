You were but  a nymph when last my eyes had beheld you, and now you are matured into a  goddess.\"    The duke then made some slight allusion to the family of madame Lagarde,  but guessing with his admirable tact, that such reminiscences could not  be particularly agreeable to me, he dexterously turned the conversation,  by requesting permission to present to me his nephew, the duc  d'Aiguillon, that he might leave a worthy substitute and champion near  the king when state affairs called him into Gascony; he craved my kind  offices to obtain the intimate acquaintance of comte Jean. They  were subsequently at daggers drawn with each other, but this haughty  overbearing lord conducted himself at first with the most abject  servility. The third favor he had to solicit was that I would name him  to the king as frequently as opportunities occurred to form one of our  supper parties. All this I engaged to do, nor indeed could I refuse  after the violent protestations of friendship he made me.    \"You will, ere long,\" said he, \"see the whole court at your feet, but  beware of considering them all as your friends; have a care, above all,  of the duchesse de Grammont. She has been long endeavoring to obtain the  king's affections, and she will see with hatred and fury another more  worthy engrossing the place she has so vainly contended for; she and  her impertinent brother will call in the aid of the devil himself to  dispossess you of your elevated seat; you are lost if you do not twist  both their necks.\"    \"How, monsieur le marechal, shall I mark my career by a murder?\"    \"You take me too literally; I only mean that in your place I would not  be at the trouble of keeping any terms with them.\"    \"Ah, monsieur le duc, I understand you now; yet it seems a bad augury to  have to begin my reign by cabals and intrigues.\"    \"Alas! my fair comtesse, you are too good, too guileless for a court  life; between ourselves we are all hypocrites more or less; mistrust  every one, even those make the finest protestations.\"    \"In that case the first object of my suspicion would be my old and  esteemed friend the marechal de Richelieu.\"    \"Ah, madame! this is not fair usage, thus to turn my weapons against  myself, and to fight me with my own arms.\"    Upon this the duke quitted me, and scarcely had he left the room, when  the duc la Vauguyon entered. This gentleman offered me no advice; he  contented himself by styling the Jesuits his \"very good friends,\" and  continually turning the conversation upon their merits. I allowed him  to express his attachment, without interruption, for these disagreeable  men, whom I determined in my own mind to have nothing to do with,  recollecting all I had heard of their dislike to our sex. After an hour  passed in amusing talk, the duc de la Vauguyon retired, well pleased  with his visit, and his place was immediately supplied by comte Jean,  to whom I communicated all that had passed between my late visitors and  myself.    \"For heaven's sake,\" said he, \"let us not be the dupes of these great  lords; before we range ourselves under the banners of either of them let  us secure our own footing; let us wait till you are presented.\"    \"But, my good friend, I must be a married lady to obtain that honor.\"    \"And so you will be shortly, do not be uneasy about that. I have written  to my brother William to set out without delay for Paris. Your swain  will be easily induced to marry you. What do you think of that?\"    I gave comte Jean to comprehend, by signs, that I left my destiny in his  hands, and he kissed my hands and withdrew. The king managed to steal a  few minutes to converse with me.    \"You did not intrust me, my sweet friend,\" said he, \"with the  circumstance of your having formerly known the duc de Richelieu; less  reserved on the subject than you were, he told me he had seen you at the  house of madame Lagarde, who considered you one of her dearest friends.\"    \"Sire,\" replied I, \"I was too much occupied with your majesty, to think  of any other person in the world.\"    My answer delighted him, he looked at me in the most gracious manner.    \"You would almost persuade me that you love me,\" said he, smiling.    \"Indeed, your majesty,\" said I, \"I only pray that you desire the  continuance of my affection.\"    \"In that case,\" replied he, kissing my hand with fervor, \"you do but  partake of my tenderness for you.\"    These words flattered my vanity, and here I must declare that if I never  felt for the king that violent attachment which is termed love, I ever  entertained for him the warmest esteem. He was so attentive, so kind to  me, that I must have been a monster of ingratitude could I have looked  upon him with indifference.    Our supper on this night was again lively as the first had been. The  duc de Richelieu entertained us with several amusing anecdotes; not that  they contained any thing very piquant, but the duke related them well,  and we were all in the humor to be pleased, and laughed heartily at  what he said. Comte Jean, whose eye constantly followed me, appeared  perfectly satisfied with all I said or did. As for the king, he seemed  enchanted with me, and seemed wholly occupied in watching my looks, that  he might anticipate my wants. After supper, in the _tete-a-tete_  which followed, he explained himself in terms which left me no doubt how  securely my empire over him was established. Had he been less explicit  on the subject, the flattering marks of favor, and the adulatory  compliments I received from all on the following day, would well have  assured me of it. I was no longer an obscure and friendless individual,  but the beloved mistress of the king; I was, to use the expression of  Lebel, a new sun which had arisen to illumine horizon of Versailles.  I could no longer doubt my power when I saw noble personages present  themselves to solicit the most servile employments about my person.  Amongst others, I might instance a certain lady de St. Benoit, who  continued first lady of my chamber, during the whole time of my  regency;--my justly-valued Henriette being contented to take the second  place of honor.

He was not young, but handsome and  well made, with much amiability and great courage. A sincere friend, no  consideration could weaken his regard; an adversary to be dreaded, no  obstacle could repress his boldness. His enemies--and amongst them  he included the whole magistracy--his enemies, I say, have used him  shamefully, but he treated them too ill for them to be believed in  any thing they say of him. If he were ambitious, he had the excuse of  superior merit, and if he showed himself too severe in one particular,  it proceeded from an energy of mind which did not allow him to have more  pity for others than they had for him. Do not, my friend, think that the  attachment I had for him can transport me beyond just limits. Since he  is in his grave, my illusions, if I had any, have dissipated. I only  give to my deceased friends the tribute due to them--truth and tears.  But really, without thinking of it, I am attributing to myself these  virtues without necessity, forgetting that you are not one of those who  would fain render me as black as possible in the eyes of posterity.    In proportion as the first sight of the uncle had prejudiced me against  him, so much more did it propitiate me towards the nephew. I saw in him  a generous heart, and a genius capable of lofty actions which you would  vainly have sought for in the marechal de Richelieu. No doubt at the  beginning of our _liaison_ the duc d'Aiguillon only saw in me a woman  who could be useful to his projects and plans; but soon his heart joined  the alliance, and a devotion of calculation was succeeded by a vehement  passion, of which I was justly proud, as it subdued to my chains the  most accomplished of courtiers.    Our first interview was lively. The marechal and he supported the  conversation with much gaiety. M. de Richelieu, as I have already told  you, had neither wit nor information, but possessed that ease of the  first circles, those manners of high breeding, those courtly graces,  which often surpass wit and information.    \"My nephew,\" said he to the duke, \"madame can do much for us, but we  must first do something for her. Without support, without friends, she  will be lost at Versailles; let us be her partisans if she will allow  it, and let her youth have the benefit of our experience.\"    The tone in which the duc d'Aiguillon replied delighted me. He said he  was but too happy to serve me, and begged me to rely on him as I would  on myself.    \"But,\" he continued, \"but we have to struggle with a powerful party. The  duchesse de Grammont and her brother are not the persons to give up the  field without striking a blow. But, madame, by the assistance of your  happy and lovely star, I will enter the lists with pleasure, and if a  glance of your eyes will recompense a conqueror, I shall be he.\"    \"Oh,\" exclaimed the duke, \"my nephew's a second Amadis in gallantry, and  of undaunted courage. You will be satisfied with him, madame, much more  than with my son, who only resembles the family in his defects.\"    The duc"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],[0,"Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#9)"],[1,"the blood, and the blood could not do its work for the body.    Impure air-will poison you. You should not breathe it. If your head  aches, and you feel dull and sleepy from being in a close room, a run in  the fresh air will make you feel better.    The good, pure air makes your blood pure; and the blood then flows  quickly through your whole body and refreshes every part.    We must be careful not to stay in close rooms in the day-time, nor sleep  in close rooms at night. We must not keep out the fresh air that our  bodies so much need.    It is better to breathe through the nose than through the mouth. You can  soon learn to do so, if you try to keep your mouth shut when walking or  running.    If you keep the mouth shut and breathe through the nose, the little  hairs on the inside of the nose will catch the dust or other impurities  that are floating in the air, and so save their going to the lungs. You  will get out of breath less quickly when running if you keep your mouth  shut.      DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE LUNGS?    The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku  lar) walls. Every time we breathe, these walls have to move. The muscles  of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you  breathe.    All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is  directed by the nerves.    You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so  you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs. Is  alcohol a help to them?      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. Besides carrying food all over the body, what            other work does the blood do?              2. Why does the blood in the veins look blue?              3. Where is the blood made pure and red again?              4. Where is it sent, from the lungs?              5. What must the lungs have in order to do this            work?              6. When do the lungs rest?              7. Why should we not wear tight clothes?              8. How does the air in a room become spoiled?              9. How can we keep it fresh and pure?              10. How should we breathe?              11. Why is it better to breathe through the nose            than through the mouth?              12. Why is alcohol not good for the lungs?          CHAPTER XVI.    THE SKIN.      [Illustration: T]HERE is another part of your body carrying away waste  matter all the time--it is the skin.    The body is covered with skin. It is also lined with a more delicate  kind of skin. You can see where the outside skin and the lining skin  meet at your lips.    There is a thin outside layer of skin which we can pull off without  hurting ourselves; but I advise you not to do so. Because under the  outside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it  will feel the least touch as pain. When the outer skin, which protects  it, is torn away, we must cover the true skin to keep it from harm.    In hot weather, or when any one has been working or playing hard, the  face, and sometimes the whole body, is covered with little drops of  water. We call these drops perspiration (p[~e]r sp[)i] r[=a]'sh[)u]n).    [Illustration: _Perspiratory tube._]    Where does it come from? It comes through many tiny holes in the skin,  called pores (p[=o]rz). Every pore is the mouth of a tiny tube which is  carrying off waste matter and water from your body. If you could piece  together all these little perspiration tubes that are in the skin of one  person, they would make a line more than three miles long.    Sometimes, you can not see the perspiration, because there is not enough  of it to form drops. But it is always coming out through your skin, both  in winter and summer. Your body is kept healthy by having its worn-out  matter carried off in this way, as well as in other ways.      THE NAILS.    The nails grow from the skin.    The finger nails are little shields to protect the ends of your fingers  from getting hurt. These finger ends are full of tiny nerves, and would  be badly off without such shields. No one likes to see nails that have  been bitten.      CARE OF THE SKIN.    Waste matter is all the time passing out through the perspiration tubes  in the skin. This waste matter must not be left to clog up the little  openings of the tubes. It should be washed off with soap and water.    When children have been playing out-of-doors, they often have very dirty  hands and faces. Any one can see, then, that they need to be washed. But  even if they had been in the cleanest place all day and had not touched  any thing dirty, they would still need the washing; for the waste matter  that comes from the inside of the body is just as hurtful as the mud or  dust of the street. You do not see it so plainly, because it comes out  very little at a time. Wash it off well, and your skin will be fresh and  healthy, and able to do its work. If the skin could not do its work, you  would die.    Do not keep on your rubber boots or shoes all through school-time.  Rubber will not let the perspiration pass off, so the little pores get  clogged and your feet begin to feel uncomfortable, or your head may  ache. No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the  rest of the body. But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors when  the ground is wet. Certainly, they are very useful then.    When you are out in the fresh air, you are giving the other parts of  your body such a good chance to perspire, that your feet can bear a  little shutting up. But as soon as you come into the house, take the  rubbers off.    Now that you know what the skin is doing all the time, you will  understand that the clothes worn next to your skin are full of little  worn-out particles, brought out by the perspiration. When these clothes  are taken off at night, they should be so spread out, that they will  air well before morning. Never wear any of the clothes through the  night, that you have worn during the day.    Do not roll up your night-dress in the morning and put it under your  pillow. Give it first a good airing at the window and then hang it where  the air can reach it all day. By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep  at night.    You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes off from the bed, before  leaving your rooms in the morning. In this way, the bed and bed-clothes  may have a good airing. Be sure to give them time enough for this.      WORK OF THE BODY.    You have now learned about four important kinds of work:--    1st. The stomach prepares the food for the blood to take.    2d. The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of  the body, and to take away worn-out matter.    3d. The lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and  pure again.    4th. The skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration  tubes.    All this work goes on, day and night, without our needing to think about  it at all; for messages are sent to the muscles by the nerves which keep  them faithfully at work, whether we know it or not.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. What covers the body?              2. What lines the body?              3. Where are the nerves of the skin?              4. What is perspiration? What is the common name            for it?              5. What are the pores of the skin?              6. How does the perspiration help to keep you            well?              7. Of what use are the nails?              8. How should they be kept?              9. What care should be taken of the skin?              10. Why should you not wear rubber boots or            overshoes in the house?              11. Why should you change under-clothing night and            morning?              12.

Name the four kinds of work about which you            have learned.              15. How are the organs of the body kept at work?          CHAPTER XVII.    THE SENSES.      [Illustration: W]E have five ways of learning about all things around  us. We can see them, touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear them.  Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing, are called the five senses.    You already know something about them, for you are using them all the  time.    In this lesson, you will learn a little more about seeing and hearing.      THE EYES.    In the middle of your eye is a round, black spot, called the pupil. This  pupil is only a hole with a muscle around it. When you are in the light,  the muscle draws up, and makes the pupil small, because you can get all  the light you need through a small opening. When you are in the dark,  the muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to let in more light.    The pupils of the cat's eyes are very large in the dark. They want all  the light they can get, to see if there are any mice about.    [Illustration: _The eyelashes and the tear-glands._]    The pupil of the eye opens into a little, round room where the nerve of  sight is. This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not  bear too much light. It carries to the brain an account of every thing  we see.    We might say the eye is taking pictures for us all day long, and that  the nerve of sight is describing these pictures to the brain.      CARE OF THE EYES.    The nerves of sight need great care, for they are very delicate.    Do not face a bright light when you are reading or studying. While  writing, you should sit so that the light will come from the left side;  then the shadow of your hand will not fall upon your work.    One or two true stories may help you to remember that you must take good  care of your eyes.    The nerve of sight can not bear too bright a light. It asks to have the  pupil made small, and even the eyelid curtains put down, when the light  is too strong.    Once, there was a boy who said"]]]
