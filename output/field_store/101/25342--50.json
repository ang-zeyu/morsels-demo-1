On the 1st of December, 1848, 150 deck passengers of the steamer  Londonderry were ordered below by the captain and the hatches closed  upon them: seventy were found dead the next morning.    The streams which intersect our great prairies have but a very sparse  growth of wood or vegetation upon their banks, so that one of the  fundamental causes for the generation of noxious malaria does not, to  any great extent, exist here, and I believe that persons may encamp  with impunity directly upon their banks.      PICKET GUARDS.    When a party is sufficiently strong, a picket guard should be stationed  during the night some two or three hundred yards in advance of the  point which is most open to assault, and on low ground, so that an  enemy approaching over the surrounding higher country can be seen  against the sky, while the sentinel himself is screened from  observation. These sentinels should not be allowed to keep fires,  unless they are so placed that they can not be seen from a distance.    During the day the pickets should be posted on the summits of the  highest eminences in the vicinity of camp, with instructions to keep a  vigilant lookout in all directions; and, if not within hailing  distance, they should be instructed to give some well-understood  telegraphic signals to inform those in camp when there is danger. For  example, should Indians be discovered approaching at a great distance,  they may raise their caps upon the muzzles of their pieces, and at the  same time walk around in a circle; while, if the Indians are near and  moving rapidly, the sentinel may swing his cap and run around rapidly  in a circle. To indicate the direction from which the Indians are  approaching, he may direct his piece toward them, and walk in the same  line of direction.    Should the pickets suddenly discover a party of Indians very near, and  with the apparent intention of making an attack, they should fire their  pieces to give the alarm to the camp.    These telegraphic signals, when well understood and enforced, will tend  greatly to facilitate the communication of intelligence throughout the  camp, and conduce much to its security.    The picket guards should receive minute and strict orders regarding  their duties under all circumstances, and these orders should be  distinctly understood by every one in the camp, so that no false alarms  will be created. All persons, with the exception of the guards and  herders, should after dark be confined to the limits of the chain of  sentinels, so that, if any one is seen approaching from without these  limits, it will be known that they are strangers.    As there will not often be occasion for any one to pass the chain of  pickets during the night, it is a good rule (especially if the party is  small), when a picket sentinel discovers any one lurking about his post  from without, if he has not himself been seen, to quietly withdraw and  report the fact to the commander, who can wake his men and make his  arrangements to repel an attack and protect his animals. If, however,  the man upon the picket has been seen, he should distinctly challenge  the approaching party, and if he receives no answer, fire, and retreat  to camp to report the fact.    It is of the utmost importance that picket guards should be wide awake,  and allow nothing to escape their observation, as the safety of the  whole camp is involved. During a dark night a man can see better  himself, and is less exposed to the view of others, when in a sitting  posture than when standing up or moving about. I would therefore  recommend this practice for night pickets.    Horses and mules (especially the latter), whose senses of hearing and  smelling are probably more acute than those of almost any other  animals, will discover any thing strange or unusual about camp much  sooner than a man. They indicate this by turning in the direction from  whence the object is approaching, holding their heads erect, projecting  their ears forward, and standing in a fixed and attentive attitude.  They exhibit the same signs of alarm when a wolf or other wild animal  approaches the camp; but it is always wise, when they show fear in this  manner, to be on the alert till the cause is ascertained.    Mules are very keenly sensitive to danger, and, in passing along over  the prairies, they will often detect the proximity of strangers long  before they are discovered by their riders. Nothing seems to escape  their observation; and I have heard of several instances where they  have given timely notice of the approach of hostile Indians, and thus  prevented stampedes.    Dogs are sometimes good sentinels, but they often sleep sound, and are  not easily awakened on the approach of an enemy.    In marching with large force, unless there is a guide who knows the  country, a small party should always be sent in advance to search for  good camping-places, and these parties should be dispatched early  enough to return and meet the main command in the event of not finding  a camping-place within the limits of the day's march. A regiment should  average upon the prairies, where the roads are good, about eighteen  miles a day, but, if necessary, it can make 25 or even 30 miles. The  advance party should therefore go as far as the command can march,  provided the requisites for camping are not found within that distance.  The article of first importance in campaigning is grass, the next  water, and the last fuel.    It is the practice of most persons traveling with large ox trains to  select their camps upon the summit of a hill, where the surrounding  country in all directions can be seen. Their cattle are then  continually within view from the camp, and can be guarded easily.    When a halt is made the wagons are \"corraled,\" as it is called, by  bringing the two front ones near and parallel to each other. The two  next are then driven up on the outside of these, with the front wheels  of the former touching the rear wheels of the latter, the rear of the  wagons turned out upon the circumference of the circle that is being  formed, and so on until one half the circle is made, when the rear of  the wagons are turned in to complete the circle. An opening of about  twenty yards should be left between the last two wagons for animals to  pass in and out of the corral, and this may be closed with two ropes  stretched between the wagons. Such a corral forms an excellent and  secure barricade against Indian attacks, and a good inclosure for  cattle while they are being yoked; indeed, it is indispensable.      STAMPEDES.    Inclosures are made in the same manner for horses and mules, and, in  case of an attempt to stampede them, they should be driven with all  possible dispatch into the corral, where they will be perfectly secure.  A \"stampede\" is more to be dreaded upon the plains than almost any  disaster that can happen. It not unfrequently occurs that very many  animals are irretrievably lost in this way, and the objects of an  expedition thus defeated.    The Indians are perfectly familiar with the habits and disposition of  horses and mules, and with the most effectual methods of terrifying  them. Previous to attempting a stampede, they provide themselves with  rattles and other means for making frightful noises; thus prepared,  they approach as near the herds as possible without being seen, and  suddenly, with their horses at full speed, rush in among them, making  the most hideous and unearthly screams and noises to terrify them, and  drive them off before their astonished owners are able to rally and  secure them.    As soon as the animals are started the Indians divide their party,  leaving a portion to hurry them off rapidly, while the rest linger some  distance in the rear, to resist those who may pursue them.    Horses and mules will sometimes, especially in the night, become  frightened and stampeded from very slight causes. A wolf or a deer  passing through a herd will often alarm them, and cause them to break  away in the most frantic manner. Upon one occasion in the Choctaw  country, my entire herd of about two hundred horses and mules all  stampeded in the night, and scattered over the country for many miles,  and it was several days before I succeeded in collecting them together.  The alarm occurred while the herders were walking among the animals,  and without any perceptible cause. The foregoing facts go to show how  important it is at all times to keep a vigilant guard over animals. In  the vicinity of hostile Indians, where an attack may be anticipated,  several good horses should be secured in such positions that they will  continually be in readiness for an emergency of this kind. The herdsmen  should have their horses in hand, saddled and bridled, and ready at an  instant's notice to spring upon their backs and drive the herds into  camp. As soon as it is discovered that the animals have taken fright,  the herdsmen should use their utmost endeavors to turn them in the  direction of the camp, and this can generally be accomplished by riding  the bell mare in front of the herd, and gradually turning her toward  it, and slackening her speed as the familiar objects about the camp  come in sight. This usually tends to quiet their alarm.          CHAPTER III.    Repairing broken Wagons. Fording Rivers. Quicksand. Wagon Boats. Bull  Boats. Crossing Packs. Swimming Animals.

For its complete ultimate success, the present revival of true English  Heraldry must mainly depend upon the manner in which we apply the  lessons that may be learned by us, no less from the warnings of the  recent evil days of the science, than from the example of the brilliant  ones that preceded them long ago. Nor should we deal faithfully with our  revived Heraldry, were we not to form a just estimate of whatever was  imperfect in the best era of its early history, in order to apply to  present improvement the lessons that thus also may be learned. It must  be admitted that the Heralds and Heraldic writers of the 17th century,  following the footsteps of some of their immediate predecessors, led the  way towards the thorough debasement of their own science. Their example  was not without effect upon those who followed them--men quite equal to  the perpetration of whatever had not been already done to bring Heraldry  into contempt. This was accomplished first, by gravely discoursing, in  early heraldic language, upon the imaginary Heraldry of the patriarchal  and antediluvian worthies: making a true coat of arms of Joseph's \"coat  of many colours,\" giving armorial ensigns to David and Gideon, to Samson  and Joshua, to \"that worthy gentilman Japheth,\" to Jubal and Tubal-Cain,  and crowning the whole by declaring that our common progenitor, Adam,  bore on his own red shield Eve's shield of silver, after the mediæval  fashion that would denote his wife to have been an heiress!    Then there set in a flood of allegorical and fantastic absurdities, by  which the fair domain of Heraldry was absolutely overwhelmed. Wild and  strange speculations, in a truly vain philosophy, interwoven with  distorted images of both the myths and the veritable records of classic  antiquity, were either deduced from armorial blazonry, or set forth as  the sources from whence it was developed. Fables and anecdotes, having  reference to less remote eras, were produced in great variety and in  copious abundance. The presence in blazon of animated beings of  whatsoever kinds, whether real or fabulous, led to rambling  disquisitions in the most ludicrously _un_natural of imaginary Natural  History. From every variety also of inanimate figure and device, the  simplest no less than the more elaborate, after the same fashion some  \"moral\" was sought to be extracted. The technical language, too, of the  early Heralds, had its expressive simplicity travestied by a complicated  jargon, replete with marvellous assertions, absurd doctrines, covert  allusions devoid of consistent significance, quaint and yet trivial  conceits, and bombastic rhapsodies. Even the nomenclature of the  Tinctures was not exempt from a characteristic course of \"treatment,\"  two distinctive additional sets of titles for gold, silver, blue, red,  &c., having been devised and substituted for those in general use (see  Chapter V.); of these the one set was derived from the names of the  _Planets_, and employed to emblazon the insignia of Sovereign Princes;  and the other set, derived from the names of _Jewels_, was applied to  the arms of Nobles. In the midst of all the rubbish, however, which they  thus delighted to accumulate, there may generally be discovered in the  works of writers of this class, here and there, references to earlier  usages and illustrations of original principles which, in the extreme  dearth of genuine early heraldic literature, are both interesting and of  real value. Nor are these writings without their value, estimated from  another point of view, as contemporaneous and unconscious commentaries  upon the history of their own times. It must be added that, in more than  a few instances, beneath the surface there lurks a vein of both  political and personal allusion, of which the point and bearing now are  altogether lost, or at the most are only open to conjecture and surmise.  And, again, even in their most extravagant and frivolous lucubrations,  the heraldic writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are not  without touches of humour; as when Gerard Legh (A.D. 1562), discoursing  of \"beastes,\" remarks of the \"Ramme\" that in \"aucthoritye he is a Duke,  for hee hath the leadyng of multitudes and flockes of his own kynde;\"  and of the ass, \"I could write much of this beaste, but that it might be  thought it were to mine own glorie.\"    The adoption of additional quarterings for the purpose of display, and  the introduction of more complicated compositions in the time of  HENRY VIII., were speedily followed by the substitution of pictorial  representations, often of a most frivolous and inconsistent character,  and many of them altogether unintelligible without written explanations,  instead of the simple, dignified, and expressive insignia of true  Heraldry. For example, in the year 1760, a grant of arms was made to a  Lincolnshire family named Tetlow, which, with thirteen other figures,  includes the representation of a book duly clasped and ornamented,  having on it a silver penny; while above the book rests a dove, holding  in its beak a crow-quill! This was to commemorate one of the family  having, with a crow-quill, actually achieved the exploit of writing the  Lord's Prayer within the compass of a silver penny. Amongst the most  objectionable of the arms of this class are those which were granted to  distinguished naval and military officers--arms, that certainly ought to  have conferred fresh honour on illustrious names, instead of inflicting  dishonour upon Heraldry itself. Battles by sea and land, landscapes and  sea views and fortified cities, flags of all kinds, with medals and  ribbons, all of them intermixed with devices not quite so unheraldic,  abound in these extravagant compositions. The arms of Lord Nelson, and  still more recently those of General Lord Gough, may be specified as  flagrant examples of this degenerate pictorial Heraldry. The Duke of  Wellington happily escaped a similar infliction. It would be but too  easy to enumerate other equally inconsistent and unheraldic  compositions: but, I must be content to refer only to the armorial  shield granted to the great astronomer, Sir John Herschel, on which is  displayed his forty-foot reflecting telescope, with all its apparatus!  These, and all such violations of heraldic truth and consistency, though  in some instances they are of very recent date, are now to be assigned  to a closed chapter in the history of English Heraldry. But in  considering them it must not be forgotten that this kind of grant was  not confined to this country, but flourished to a still greater extent  abroad.    In our present revival of English Heraldry, it is essential that we  impress upon our minds a correct conception of the twofold character of  all Heraldry--that it is a _Science_, and also that it is an _Art_. We  have to vindicate the reputation of our Heraldry, as well in the one  capacity as in the other. Of very noble heraldic Art we happily possess  original examples in great numbers, which have been bequeathed to us, as  a precious inheritance, from \"the brave days of old.\" The style of Art  that we see exemplified in these early authorities we may accept almost  unreservedly as our own style; and we must aspire to sympathise heartily  with their genuine heraldic feeling. In our representation, also, of  almost all inanimate and natural objects in our own armorial  compositions, as a general rule, we may trust confidently to the same  good guidance. The early method of representation, indeed, must form the  basis of our system of treatment; and, we may faithfully adhere to this  rule, and yet occasionally we may find it to be desirable that the form  and the accessories of some devices should be adapted to modern  associations. In truth, it is not by merely copying the works of even  the greatest of the early heraldic artists, that we are to become  masters in heraldic Art. When the copies are good, copying is always  valuable, as a branch of study; but, if it be our highest and only aim  to reproduce the expressions of other men's thoughts, then copying is  worse than worthless. What we have to do is to express our heraldic Art  in the spirit of the early Heralds, to keep it in harmony with what, in  the best of the early days, they would have accepted as the highest  heraldic Art, and at the same time to show that our heraldic Art in very  truth is our own.      [Illustration: No. 24.--Prince JOHN OF ELTHAM, A.D. 1336.]      [Illustration: Nos. 25, 26.--Badge of RICHARD II., Westminster Hall.]    The treatment of animate creatures in Heraldry requires a certain kind,  and also a certain degree, of conventionalism. Here, as before, in the  early Heralds we have excellent masters; but, here we must follow their  teaching with more of reserve, and with cautious steps. We recognise the  happy consistency of the conventionalism which they displayed in their  representation of animate creatures, without any purpose to adopt it in  the same degree with them. Had the early Heralds been more familiar with  the living presence of the various creatures that they summoned to enter  into their service, without a doubt they would have represented them  with a much closer conformity to Nature. We must apply our better  knowledge, as we may feel confident the early Heralds would have applied  a similar knowledge had they been able to have acquired it. Heraldic  animals of every kind--lions, eagles, dolphins, and all others--must be  so far subjected to a conventional treatment, that they will not exhibit  a _strictly_ natural appearance: and, on the other hand, being carefully  preserved from all exaggerated conventionalisms, they must approach as  near to Nature as a definite conventional rendering of natural truth  will admit.
