First, prepare the fruit, and put it in mixed layers of  plums, pears, berries, apples, alternating each other, in stone jars.  Next, put the six pounds of sugar in a clean saucepan, with the quart of  water, and stir it with a spoon on the fire till it comes to a gentle  boil; remove the dirty scum from the surface of the sugar; and, after  allowing it to boil for ten minutes, pour it in equal proportions into  the jar or jars containing the fruits, and place them in a moderate heat  to bake slowly for three hours at least. When boiling the sugar for this  purpose, remember that it is most prudent to use a saucepan capable of  containing double the quantity, as sugar is very liable to boil over and  waste. When the fruit is nearly dissolved, the raisinet will be done; it  must then be removed to a cool place until it has become thoroughly cold  and partially set firm; the jars should then be tied down with thick  paper, or bladder, and kept in the cellar for winter use, either for  making puddings or tarts, or for spreading on bread for the children.      No. 107. CURRANT JAM.    Ingredients, twelve pounds of picked currants, either red, black, or  white, or, if agreeable, mixed; eight pounds of raw sugar, three pints  of water. If you could borrow what is called a preserving-pan from a  neighbour, it would suit the purpose better than a pot; but, failing the  preserving-pan, put the eight pounds of sugar in a four-gallon iron pot,  with the three pints of water; stir these on the fire till the sugar  boils; remove the scum from the surface, and, when it has boiled for  about ten minutes, add the currants, and keep stirring the jam, while it  boils for half an hour; and then, if it presents the appearance of being  rather thick, and the currants partly dissolved, it will be ready to  pour into stone jars, which, after being allowed to cool all night, are  to be tied down with paper, and kept in a cold place for winter's use.  All kinds of seed fruit can be prepared in the same manner, as well as  all kinds of plums.      No. 108. HOW TO PRESERVE RHUBARB.    Free the rhubarb from leaves, cut it up in inch lengths, wash and drain  it in a sieve or colander. Next, put the rhubarb into a sufficiently  large pot, or preserving-pan, with a little water--say a pint of water  to ten pounds of rhubarb, and put this on the fire, with the lid on, to  boil until dissolved to a pulp, stirring it occasionally; as soon as all  the rhubarb is dissolved, add six pounds of moist sugar, and stir the  whole continuously on the fire while boiling fast, until reduced to a  rather stiff paste or marmalade--this will require about half an hour's  boiling; the preserve or jam must then be immediately put into jars, or  gallipots, and, when cold, is to be covered with stiff paper, and tied  round with string. Keep the jam in a cold place, for use.      No. 109. HOW TO MAKE GOOSEBERRY JAM.    Pick ten pounds of ripe gooseberries, put them in a covered pot, with a  pint of water, and set them on the fire to boil to a pulp, stirring them  frequently, and, when they are thoroughly dissolved, add six pounds of  sugar, and stir the whole continuously while boiling on the fire, until  the jam is reduced to a rather stiff paste; it must then be poured into  gallipots, and, when cold, is to be covered with paper, and tied round  with string.      No. 110. BAKED PEARS.    Put the pears, standing up side by side in rows, with their stalks  uppermost, in an earthenware baking dish; add a sprinkle of moist  sugar, a few cloves, and a pint of cider or water, and bake them until  they are done. The time for cooking them depends upon their size and  kind.      No. 111. BAKED APPLES.    Put the apples on a baking-dish, with a sprinkle of sugar, and a drop of  cider or water, and set them in the oven to bake. Baked apples or pears,  with bread, form a cheap, wholesome, and proper kind of supper for  children.      No. 112. TO MAKE ELDER WINE.    Ingredients, two gallons of elderberries, two quarts of damsons, eight  pounds of raw sugar, at 4-1/2_d._ per pound, two gallons of water, two  ounces of ginger, one ounce of cloves, and half a pint of fresh yeast.  To make this quantity of elder wine, you must have a copper, a tub, a  large canvas or loose flannel bag, and a five-gallon barrel. First,  crush the elderberries and damsons thoroughly in the pot or copper in  which they are to be boiled; then add the water, and keep stirring all  together as it boils, until the fruit is well dissolved; then use a  wooden bowl or a basin to pour the whole into a loose flannel bag,  steadily fixed across two stout sticks, resting safely on two chairs,  or, if you have one, a large coarse sieve instead. When all the liquor  has passed through into the tub, put the dregs back into the copper, to  be boiled up with a couple of quarts of water, and then to be strained  to the other liquor. The next part of the process is to put the whole of  the elderberry juice back into the clean pot or copper, with the sugar,  and the spice, well bruised with a hammer; stir all together, on the  fire, and allow the wine to boil gently for half an hour, then pour it  into the clean tub to cool; the half-pint of yeast must then be added,  and thoroughly mixed by stirring. At the end of two days, skim off the  yeast which, by that time, will have risen to the surface. The elder  wine must now be put into the barrel, and kept in the cellar with the  bung-hole left open for a fortnight; at the end of this time, a stiff  brown paper should be pasted over the bung-hole, and after standing for  a month or six weeks, the wine will be ready for use. To be obliged to  buy all the ingredients for making elder wine, would render it a matter  of great difficulty--perhaps, in some cases, an impossibility; but,  remember, that when living in the country, where in some parts  elderberries grow in the hedge-rows, you may have them for the trouble  of gathering them, in which case the elder wine would be cheaper, and  more easily within your means.      No. 113. VEGETABLE PORRIDGE.    Scrape and peel the following vegetables:--six carrots, six turnips, six  onions, three heads of celery, and three parsnips; slice up all these  very thinly, and put them into a two-gallon pot, with four ounces of  butter, a handful of parsley, ditto of chervil, and a good sprig of  thyme, and fill up with water or pot liquor, if you happen to have any;  season with pepper and salt, and put the whole to boil very gently on  the fire for two hours; at the end of this time the vegetables will be  done to a pulp, and the whole must be rubbed through a colander with a  wooden spoon, and afterwards put back into the pot and stirred over the  fire, to make it hot for dinner.      No. 114. PUMPKIN PORRIDGE.    I am aware that pumpkins are not generally grown in this country as an  article of food for the poorer classes, and more is the pity, for they  require but little trouble to rear, and yield an abundance of nutritious  and cooling food, at a small cost; the chief reason for the short  supply is, I imagine, the want of knowledge for turning the pumpkin to  good account as an article of food. I am now about to supply easy  instruction to convey that knowledge to whomsoever may stand in need of  it. Peel and slice up as much pumpkin as will produce about eight ounces  for each person, and put this into a boiling pot, with two ounces of  butter, and a quart of water; set the whole to boil very gently on the  fire, until the pumpkin is reduced to a pulp, and then add half-a-pint  of buttermilk, or skim milk, to every person who is to partake of the  porridge. You then stir the porridge over the fire for about fifteen  minutes longer, taking care that it does not boil over; season with salt  and a little nutmeg, and eat it with toasted bread for breakfast, or any  other meal.      No. 115. RICE-MILK FOR SIX PERSONS.    Put one pound of Patna rice into a boiling pot with two ounces of  butter, two quarts of water, a small bit of cinnamon or lemon-peel, and  a little salt; put the lid on, and set the rice to boil very gently  indeed close to the hob, until the rice is done quite soft; this will  take about one hour and a quarter; then add three pints of skim milk,  and after having stirred the rice-milk over the fire for ten minutes  longer, it may be sweetened with a little honey or sugar, and will  produce an excellent breakfast for at least six persons.      No. 116. KNUCKLE OF VEAL AND RICE.    A small knuckle, or scrag-end of neck of veal, is sometimes to be  purchased very cheap; I will therefore suppose that you may, once in a  way, provide such a thing, and this is the way you should cook it to the  best advantage. Put the knuckle of veal into a boiling pot, with a pound  of bacon, two pounds of rice, six onions, three carrots cut in pieces,  some peppercorns, and salt in moderation on account of the bacon; add  three or four quarts of water, and set the whole to stew very gently  over a moderate fire for about three hours. This will produce a good  substantial dinner for at least ten persons.      No. 117. IRISH STEW.    Inferior parts of any kind of meat make a good Irish stew. Let the meat  be cut in pieces the size of an egg, well rubbed all over with pepper  and salt, and placed in a good-sized pot or saucepan; add peeled onions  in the proportion of six to the pound of meat, and enough water just to  cover in the whole. Next, set the stew on the fire to boil very gently  for an hour and a-half, then add such quantity of peeled and split  potatoes as you may think will suffice for the number of persons about  to dine off the stew, and put the whole back on the fire to boil briskly  until the potatoes are thoroughly done soft; the Irish stew will then be  ready to eat.      No. 118. FISH SOUP.    Cod-fish cuttings, Dutch plaice, skate, dabs, haddocks, cod's-heads,  cod's-tails, or any fresh-water"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22117"],[0,"Across Coveted Lands; or, a Journey from Flushing (Holland) to Calcutta Overland (#9)"],[1," have a chance of being  conveyed by this route, owing to the prohibitive Customs duties exacted  in Russia on foreign goods in transit for Persia. Russia is already  indirectly reaping great profits through this law, especially on  machinery and heavy goods that have no option and must be transported by  this road. There is no other way by which they can reach Teheran on  wheels. But the chief and more direct profit of the enterprise itself is  derived from the high tolls which the Russian Company, with the  authorisation of the Persian Government, has established on the road  traffic, in order to reimburse the capital paid out and interest to  shareholders.    The road tolls are paid at Resht (and at intermediate stations if  travellers do not start from Resht), and amount to 4 krans == 1_s._ 8_d._  for each pack animal, whether it be a camel, a horse, a mule, or a  donkey.    A post-carriage with four horses (the usual conveyance hired between  Resht and Teheran) pays a toll of no less than 17_s._ 2_d._                                       _s._  _d._      A carriage with 3 horses       12     6            \"     \"   2   \"           8     4            \"     \"   1 horse         4     2  A _fourgon_, or luggage van, 4 horses, L1 0_s._ 10_d._    Passengers are charged extra and above these tolls, so that a landau or a  victoria, for instance, actually pays L1 8_s._ for the right of using the  road, and a _fourgon_ with one's servants, as much as L1 13_s._ 2_d._    The fares for the hire of the conveyance are very high:--                              L   _s._  _d._  Landau                   11   16     7  Victoria                 10   16     7  Coupe                    11    4    10  Fourgon                  10    0    10    As only 72 lbs. of personal luggage are allowed in the landau or 65 lbs.  in other carriages, and this weight must be in small packages, one is  compelled to hire a second conveyance, a _fourgon_, which can carry 650  lbs. Every pound exceeding these weights is charged for at the rate of  two shillings for every 131/2 lbs. of luggage. The luggage is weighed with  great accuracy before starting from Resht, and on arrival in Teheran.  Care is taken to exact every half-penny to which the company is entitled  on luggage fares, and much inconvenience and delay is caused by the  Persian officials at the scales. It is advisable for the traveller to be  present when the luggage is weighed, to prevent fraud.    It may be noticed that to travel the 200 miles, the distance from Resht  to Teheran, the cost, without counting incidental expenses, tips  (amounting to some L3 or more), etc.,              L  _s._  _d._            L  _s._  _d._     L  _s._ _d._  Landau,  11  16     7 plus toll,   1   8     0      13   4    7  Fourgon, 10   0    10 plus toll,   1  13     2      11  14    0                                                      ------------                                         Total       L24  18    7    which is somewhat high for a journey of only 72 to 80 hours.    This strikes one all the more when one compares it with the journey of  several thousand miles in the greatest of luxury from London across  Holland, Germany, Russia, and the Caspian to Enzeli, which can be covered  easily by three five-pound notes.    As every one knows, the road from Piri-Bazaar to Kasvin and Teheran was  opened for wheel traffic in January 1899.    I am told that in 1899--before the road was completed--a Persian  speculator offered the sum of L200 a day to be paid in cash every  evening, for the contract of the tolls. The offer was most emphatically  refused, as the daily tolls even at that time amounted to between L270  and L300.    In these last three years the road has developed in a most astounding  manner, and the receipts, besides being now considerably greater, are  constantly increasing. The Russian shareholders and Government can indeed  fairly congratulate themselves on the happy success which their  well-thought-out investment has fairly won them.          CHAPTER VI         A journey by landau and four--Picturesque       coachman--Tolls--Intense moisture--Luxuriant       vegetation--Deschambe Bazaar--The silk industry of Ghilan--The       cultivation and export of rice--The Governor's       energy--Agriculture and Allah--The water question--The coachman's       backshish--The White River--Olive groves--Halting places on the       road--The effects of hallucination--Princes abundant.      We have seen how the road was made. Now let us travel on it in the hired  landau and four horses driven by a wild-looking coachman, whose locks of  jet-black hair protrude on either side of his clean-shaven neck, and  match in colour his black astrakan, spherical, brimless headgear. Like  all good Persians, he has a much pleated frockcoat that once was black  and is now of various shades of green. Over it at the waist he displays a  most elaborate silver belt, and yet another belt of leather with a  profusion of cartridges stuck in it and a revolver.    Why he did not run over half-a-dozen people or more as we galloped  through the narrow streets of Resht town is incomprehensible to me, for  the outside horses almost shaved the walls on both sides, and the  splash-boards of the old landau ditto.    That he did not speaks volumes for the flexibility and suppleness of  Persian men, women and children, of whom, stuck tight against the walls  in order to escape being trampled upon or crushed to death, one got mere  glimpses, at the speed one went.    The corners of the streets, too, bore ample testimony to the inaccuracy  of drivers in gauging distances, and so did the hubs and splash-boards of  the post-carriages, all twisted and staved in by repeated collisions.    It is with great gusto on the part of the drivers, but with a certain  amount of alarm on the part of the passenger, that one's carriage chips  off corner after corner of the road as one turns them, and one gets to  thank Providence for making houses in Persia of easily-powdered mud  instead of solid stone or bricks.    One's heart gets lighter when we emerge into the more sparsely inhabited  districts where fields and heavy vegetation line the road, now very wide  and more or less straight. Here the speed is greatly increased, the  coachman making ample use of a long stock whip. In Persia one always  travels full gallop.    After not very long we pull up to disburse the road toll at a wayside  collecting house. There are a great many caravans waiting, camels, mules,  donkeys, horsemen, _fourgons_, whose owners are busy counting hard silver  krans in little piles of 10 krans each--a _toman_, equivalent to a  dollar,--without which payment they cannot proceed. Post carriages have  precedence over everybody, and we are served at once. A receipt is duly  given for the money paid, and we are off again. The coachman is the cause  of a good deal of anxiety, for on the chance of a handsome backshish he  has indulged in copious advance libations of rum or votka, or both, the  vapours of which are blown by the wind into my face each time that he  turns round and breathes or speaks. That this was a case of the horses  leading the coachman and not of a man driving the horses, I have  personally not the shade of a doubt, for the wretch, instead of minding  his horses, hung backwards, the whole way, from the high box, yelling, I  do not know what, at the top of his voice, and making significant  gestures that he was still thirsty. Coachmen of all countries invariably  are.    We ran full speed into caravans of donkeys, scattering them all over the  place; we caused flocks of frightened sheep to stampede in all  directions, and only strings of imperturbable camels succeeded in  arresting our reckless flight, for they simply would not move out of the  way. Every now and then I snatched a furtive glance at the scenery.    The moisture of the climate is so great and the heat so intense, that the  vegetation of the whole of Ghilan province is luxuriant,--but not  picturesque, mind you. There is such a superabundance of vegetation, the  plants so crammed together, one on the top of the other, as it were, all  untidy, fat with moisture, and of such deep, coarse, blackish-green tones  that they give the scenery a heavy leaden appearance instead of the  charming beauty of more delicate tints of less tropical vegetation.    We go through Deschambe Bazaar, a place noted for its fairs.    Here you have high hedges of reeds and hopelessly entangled shrubs; there  your eyes are rested on big stretches of agriculture,--Indian corn,  endless paddy fields of rice and cotton, long rows of mulberry trees to  feed silkworms upon their leaves. Silk is even to-day one of the chief  industries of Ghilan. Its excellent quality was at one time the pride of  the province. The export trade of dried cocoons has been particularly  flourishing of late, and although prices and the exchanges have  fluctuated, the average price obtained for them in Resht when fresh was  from 201/2 krans to 221/2 krans (the kran being equivalent to about  fivepence).    The cocoon trade had until recently been almost entirely in the hands of  Armenian, French and Italian buyers in Resht, but now many Persian  merchants have begun to export bales of cocoons direct to Marseilles and  Milan, the two chief markets for silk, an export duty of 5 per cent. on  their value being imposed on them by the Persian Government. The cocoons  are made to travel by the shortest routes, _via_ the Caspian, Baku,  Batum, and the Black Sea.    The year 1900 seems to have been an exceptionally good year for the  production and export of cocoons. The eggs for the production of  silkworms are chiefly imported by Levantines from Asia Minor (Gimlek and  Brussa), and also in small quantities from France. According to the  report of Mr. Churchill, Acting-Consul at Resht, the quantity of cocoons  exported during that year showed an increase of"]]]
