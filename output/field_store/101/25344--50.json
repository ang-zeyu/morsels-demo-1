Treat the other leg the same.    With forceps fill the skull back of mouth with tow cut in short pieces.  A quantity of this may be chopped on the block with the hatchet and kept  on hand in a box. Never fill any part of a mounted bird with cotton  unless it may be the sockets as it is impossible to force a sharpened  wire or pin through it.    The parts of the wing bones remaining should be wrapped with tow as the  legs are, only they hardly need any wiring inside unless the bird is to  be with wings spread. Fasten the ends of the wing bones together by a  stout cord or thread so they are separated the distance between the  shoulders, measuring across the back of body. Now insert the neck wire  in the back of skull forcing it out through the crown until the  artificial neck is brought snugly against the opening at the base of the  skull.    Bend the pointed end over to get it out of the way and adjust the skin  of the neck. Draw the skin of breast over the body keeping the bird on  its back. If the body has been properly made it will fill the skin  rather loosely. If too large it can be removed and made smaller before  proceeding.    The operator will note that in all small and medium birds the thigh and  the upper wing, next the shoulder are not built up and wired with the  rest of the limbs but are filled out later from inside the skin, as in  all ordinary positions they show but little externally, the elbow and  knee joints nestling close to the body among the feathers.    So when fastening the legs to the body let the wires enter where the  knee would lie and push the wire through obliquely, upward and forward,  pushing and drawing them through the artificial and natural leg until  the lower ends approach the feet. Grasping the sharpened ends of the leg  wires at the middle of the length projecting from the body, with round  nose pliers bend them over in a hair pin shape.    [Illustration: BIRD WIRED.]    Work this loop back through the body pulling back through the leg and  clinch the points over into the body again. If the body was firmly made  as it should be, this fixes the legs permanently to it, yet they may be  bent readily at the joints to suit various attitudes.    Adjust the skin now and fill out at shoulders, thighs, and base of tail  with some chopped tow. The breast also may need some filling. Sew up the  skin beginning at the breast and finishing at the base of tail, lacing  it together with the ball cover stitch.    The pose of the finished specimen you have probably decided on before  now so it only remains to put it in the desired attitude. This sounds  easy, like sculpture, \"just knock off what stone you don't need and  there is the statue,\" but it may try your soul at length to obtain the  desired effect. Good pictures are a great help here, as of course a  living duplicate would be if you had it.    Before setting it on its feet, coax the wings into place as you hold the  bird in your hand and pin them to the body through the elbow and outer  joint of the wing, using several pins 2 to 4 in. long or pieces of  sharpened wire the same size. This will hold the wings out of the way  and they may be changed and fitted perfectly later.    Mounted birds are usually put on temporary stands of rough boards or  limbs and when fully dried out transferred to a permanent mount which  can be prepared in the meantime of the exact size and variety wished  for. On these temporary stands the leg wires are only twisted together  so they can be easily removed. Place the feet in natural positions of  standing, walking or running and arrange the toes correctly. They had  best have some pins driven in beside the toes to secure them till dry,  as badly shaped feet will spoil the effect of an otherwise fine piece of  work, indicating a careless workman.    If on a bough or stump the feet should grasp it as if the bird really  means to stay on it. Two or three wires like those used on the wings  hold the tail in place by being driven through the base of it into the  body for half their length.    Fix the head looking down rather than up and to one side rather than  straight ahead. If you have the proper glass eyes at hand they can be  set now, if not, later will do but the lids are relaxed just now to  receive them. Fill the back of the sockets with tow or cotton and with a  little spoon-shaped modeling tool give this and the inner surface of the  lids a good coating of soft clay. The eyes, cut from the wire stem on  which most of them come, are pressed into this and the skin worked into  place with the point of a big needle or a small awl.    Now give the plumage a general going over, re-pin the wings if  necessary, and wind down any obstreperous feathers with thread. A number  of pins or wires thrust in the middle of back and breast will help this  operation.    Starting at the head wind back to the tail, lacing the thread from pin  to pin, not binding tightly with any one thread but producing a smooth  surface by holding it down at a multiplicity of points. There are a  number of so-called systems for winding birds but the same taxidermist  seldom winds two alike as the needs of the case are sure to differ. To  spread the tails of small birds, spread the feathers as desired and pin  them between two strips of light cardboard. When dry they will retain  their position. If all arranged properly set the bird away to dry; two  weeks will be sufficient for this.    [Illustration: BIRD WOUND WITH THREAD.]    Any colors on bill or feet and legs should be renewed with oil colors as  they fade almost entirely; if of a dark or neutral color originally, a  coating of transparent varnish will do. There is a variety of beetle  which delights in dining on such hard parts of mounted birds if not  protected by paint or varnish.    Place the bird on its final mount and fasten the leg wires in grooves  cut in the under side of same so they are flush with surface. The ends  may be turned over and driven in again or held fast by small staples. If  on the under side of a limb or branch a pinch of moss or lichen glued on  will cover this fastening.    Cut away the binding threads and with cutting pliers cut off all  projecting pins and wires, leaving what part of them is covered by the  feathers. Brush any clay from the eyes and if the lids have shrunken  away from them as they do usually, coat a bit of black thread with glue  and with a setting needle place between the lids and glass eyes.    [Illustration: THE POSE OR POSITION OF CERTAIN BIRDS]    If the eyes were not on hand when first mounted the lids should have  been relaxed and the eyes set as soon as procured.    Small birds may be mounted in fluttering attitudes by pinning the wings  with a bunch of cotton beneath them, but if an attitude with wings fully  spread is called for they must be treated in a manner similar to the  legs, inserting the wire under the skin near the tip of the wing and  running it along the under side of the wing bones to the body through  which it is thrust and clinched as the leg wires were.    [Illustration: FLUTTERING POSITION OF SMALL BIRDS.]    Birds mounted with spread wings cannot be so readily wound to smooth the  plumage and require to be braced with strips of stiff paper and  sometimes extra wires, which are removed when dry.    [Illustration: NATURAL STANDING POSITION OF SMALL BIRD ON LIMB.]          CHAPTER X.    MOUNTING LARGE BIRDS.      The same principles employed in the manipulation of smaller species  apply to this class with but a few variations. On account of their size  and weight the artificial bodies need to be especially firm in order to  afford a secure anchorage for the wing and leg wires. Also these  supports should be fastened to the bones in several places with stout  cord or small wire, as wrapping with the tow and thread used on small  birds is hardly sufficient.    What I would class as being large birds are the larger hawks, owls,  herons, eagles, geese, etc. The several varieties of the ostrich are  known as colossal birds and are skinned and preserved much as the large  quadrupeds by mounting the prepared skin on a manikin, built in the pose  of the finished specimen and supported by heavy iron rods.    [Illustration: BIRD OF PREY--LIMB POSITION.]    In mounting eagles or similar birds with wings spread, which seems to be  a popular attitude, use the largest wires possible as anything less than  that will, on account of their size and wide extent, tend to a drooping,  back-boneless appearance entirely out of keeping.    It goes without saying that large birds do not require the delicate  handling of small ones, but by way of compensation considerable force is  needed.    [Illustration: SPREADING TAIL OF LARGE BIRDS.    Run a small sharp wire through the quills on under side of tail to  spread it.]    The combs and wattles of domestic and wild fowls cannot by any common  process be prevented from shriveling and discoloring while drying, but  when dry they may be restored by careful modeling in colored wax. This  is applied warm with a brush and given its final finish with hot metal  modeling tools. For museum work and other high grade work such heads are  cast entire in wax in such a way that all feathers and hair are attached  in their precise places.    Large water fowl are often mounted as flying, and suspended by a very  fine wire. A sharpened wire with a ring turned in one end, thrust into  the middle of the back and clinched in the body, forms a secure point of  suspension.    As it is not usually practicable to case many specimens of large birds,  give them an extra thorough poisoning and when entirely finished spray  with either corrosive sublimate or arsenical solution.
