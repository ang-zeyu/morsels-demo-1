Their honesty must run in grooves for R. gave a heavy  overcoat to one of his men in a cold station, and when he and his  servants went to a very hot station, he noticed this man still wearing  the thick coat and sweating like anything, so he asked him why he did  so, and the man replied that he dared not put it off for a minute or it  would be stolen.    [Illustration]    We had quite an audience for the fiddles this Saturday--there are two  lady violinists now, both very good players--but we had only a short  spell of music in the music room on account of a choir practise, for  to-morrow; the parson came and took our musicians down to the  dining-room to sing over hymns and psalms, verse by verse. I heard the  wheeze of the harmonium, and got back to my own chest-lid (sailor term  for my own business)--\"Every man to his own chest-lid and the cook to  the foresheet,\" is it not a suggestive saying? To every man his  prerogative, his chest-lid, and his duties, and the same for the cook  and the least bit more! It is now getting passably mild, and we can sit  out on deck at night. It was supposed to be hot enough for the punkahs  in the saloon; one is hung over the length of each of the five tables,  to port and starboard, and there are others the whole length of the  table that runs up the middle of the saloon. I have long wished to see a  punkah, now I wish I may never see another! On this ship they are narrow  velvet rugs hung on edge from horizontal bars, this is swung by two  ropes from the roof, and they are all guyed together with cords, so that  one pull, from a lascar outside the cabin, sets them all into violent  commotion. They hit your face when you stand, and sitting, their lowest  edge stirs up your hair. These velvet rugs have white cotton covers on  them now that they are being used, so the general effect at dinner-time  is of a huge laundry in a gale, with beautiful laundresses in low  dresses sitting at table under a world of wildly flapping linen; with  the lamps lit, and our black coats for a foil, the colours are really  extremely pretty, though the discomfort is great. Men and women are all  getting a little brown with the sea air, and the ladies have a little of  the blush of spring now, instead of the pallor of winter with which they  came on board.    [Illustration]    Egypt in sight, and this morning we tubbed in the water of the river  that floated Moses, and that has been bathed in and drunk since by such  a number of people we know, or have read about. Sea and Nile are  meeting in blue, and green, and brownish stripes, blending to a general  absinthe colour as we get closer to the flat delta; little level rows of  cloud throw purple shadows across the crisp small waves, and over the  horizon there's a flight of white lateen sails.    What a bustle there is on board to-day; people running up and down  stairs with letters hurriedly finished, addressed and stamped to the  children at home. No use writing to the man who waits out there, for we  carry the mail. It is touching, the wife looking forward and back at the  same time--the bull must pass--and the young girl too, leaving the old  life for the new married life in a new country; it must take courage.    My notes at Port Said seem to have disappeared, possibly I did not write  any. I remember that there was so much to see in the morning; and the  change of colour in the water, the absinthe colour of the Nile with pale  blue reflections winding in currents in distinct streams into the sea,  would, with the blue ocean, need very subtile painting. I remember the  fearful jabber, which I suppose has gone on and always will, since Port  Said was invented. I got a glimpse of Lesseps's statue at lunch through  the port-hole; he points with right hand twice life size up the harbour  with a heroic expression, and seems to say to the steamers that come in  from the sea, \"Higher up there S.V.P.--try a little higher up.\" We  watched the often described black men coaling in black dust, singing and  working, the sun's rays making shafts of light stream through the clouds  of black coal dust; and the same pandemonium at night in the flare of  lights, when the scene is generally admitted to be like the nether  regions.    I know we went ashore somehow or other, and that we could hardly see for  the shouting and yelling! We felt fortunate in having a Mrs  Deputy-Commissioner for a companion, for she was bubbling over with  humour and anecdote. She and G. promptly began shopping, and certainly  succeeded in getting two rather becoming topees, flatter and prettier  than any I have yet seen--you might call them Romney topees; one may  appear in sketches further on. I sketched of course--always keep  \"screeb, screeb, screebling all day long,\" as an irate German lady once  put it to me, \"screebled\" a cafe scene; on the left you see a native,  who calls himself Jock Furgusson, trying to pass off a \"Genuine Egyptian  Scarab\" to a tourist. Jock Furgusson is infinitely more wonderful and  artistic to me than the pyramids, for he can imitate accents so as to  make you gasp; he spots anyone's nationality instantaneously--before you  have opened your lips he knows your county! I believe he can distinguish  between the English of a Lowland Scot and a Highlander, which is more  than '_Punch_' does after all these years of practice. \"Ah'm, Jock  Furgusson frae Auchtermurrchty and Achterlony, longest maun in the forty  twa,\" he begins--but somebody help me--I've forgotten how he goes on, a  long rigmarole in broadest Doric; the words and intonation so perfect,  you can so little believe your eyes that you are landed with a scarab or  a string of beads before you have recovered, and he is off to another  passenger, clippin' 'is g's and r's and puttin' in h's to some  Englishmen.    The inhabitants of Port Said, we are told, represent the scourings of  the Levant; too bad for Cairo, and black-balled for Hell. All the same  G. and I went ashore by ourselves after dinner, rather proud of our  courage, for several passengers said it wasn't safe. It used not to be  safe, I know, but I asked the Chief-Engineer what he thought, and he  took his right hand in his left, all but the very tip of the little  finger which he measured off with his left thumb nail, and said, \"a  black maun's heart's no as big as that.\" So we went ashore and had no  adventures at all, but sat in a balcony and listened to pretty good  music, and noted the few drowsy figures in the side streets, the glow of  lamp or brazier on their heavy draperies, contrasting with the starlight  and the deep velvety shadows--moth-like colouring, and intense  repose, after the glittering, howling day.    [Illustration: A Cafe, Port Said]    Looking back over these notes, and the Orient and Pacific Guide Book,  and the Acts of the Apostles, I observe that I have made no note about  Corsica and Sardinia, Lipari Islands, and Stromboli, or of the Straits  of Messina and Etna--have barely mentioned Crete! In the Lipari Islands  we saw lights ashore, and down the Straits of Messina; and Stromboli we  discovered easily enough by the glow of hot red up in the sky, and a  sloping line of red that went glittering downwards. It was too dark to  distinguish anything more.    We saw Crete, enough to swear by, the white top of Mount Ida, and  realized where Fair Haven and Phenice and Clauda must lie, and that we  were actually in the seas where the Apostle Paul was caught in the  Euroclydon. By the way what is a Euroclydon; is it a Levanter?    Was there ever a voyage so vividly described, in more concentrated and  pithy words? In eight verses you have a complete dramatic account of a  tragedy at sea, from a passenger's point of view. It would be curious  and interesting to learn what the owner thought, and said, when the  prisoner suggested that he, and his sailing master, and the Centurion,  were all wrong in a question of navigation; and how it came about that  shortly after this difference of opinion the prisoner was master of the  commissariat, and how, after heavy weather and fasting fourteen days on  a rocky coast, 276 souls were saved on bits of wreckage without the loss  of one life! The Board of Trade and Life Saving Societies might enquire  into this, and report.          CHAPTER VI      [Illustration]    The Canal.--If I had not seen Mr Talbot Kelly's book on Egypt I could  hardly have believed it possible that the delicate schemes of colour we  see in the desert as we pass through the canal could be painted and  reproduced in colour in a book. He has got the very bloom of the desert,  and the beauty of Egypt without its ugliness; the heat and sparkle and  brightness in his pictures are so vivid one can almost breathe the  exhilarating desert air--and smell the Bazaars! But Egypt is ugly a  pin's prick beneath its beauty. It is so old and covered with bones and  decayed ideas. The Nile is associated with Moses, and it is long it is  true, but it is also very narrow and shallow, and its banks are  monotonous to a degree; a mile or so of green crop on either side, then  stones, sand, bits of crockery, human bones and rags, then desert  sand--a cross between a cemetery and a kitchen garden. The ruins are  _awfully_ ugly! \"Think of their age!\" people say, and you look at the  exquisite spirals of shells in the lime stones with which these heaps  are made! But the saddest thing in Egypt is the fine art debased in the  temples, in these ponderous monuments of their officialism; for here and  there in them you see exquisite bits of low relief carving, that a Greek  would have been proud of, hidden away in interminable hieroglyphic  histories spread indiscriminately over grotesque pillars and vast walls,  as regardlessly of decorative effect as advertisements in a newspaper's  columns.
