Done at the City of Washington, this 29th day of May, in the year, of  our Lord 1865, and of the Independence of the United States the 89th.    By the President: Andrew Johnson. William H. Seward. Secretary of State.    North Carolina was the first of the revolted States to which this  identical plan of reconstruction, or reorganization, was applied by Mr.  Johnson. Its application to the several States then lately in revolt,  was continued till the meeting of Congress in the following December,  1865.    On this matter Mr. Johnson, himself, testifies in his communication to  the Senate in 1867, relating to the removal of Mr. Stanton, that \"This  grave subject (Reconstruction) had engaged the attention of Mr. Lincoln  in the last days of his life, and the plan according to which it was  to be managed had been prepared and was ready for adoption. A leading  feature of that plan was that it was to be carried out by Executive  authority. * * * The first business, transacted in the Cabinet after I  became President was this unfinished business of my predecessor. A plan  or scheme of reconstruction had been prepared for Mr. Lincoln by Mr.  Stanton. It was approved, and at the earliest moment practicable was  applied, in the form of a proclamation, to the State of North Carolina,  and afterwards became the basis of action in turn for the other States.\"    Mr. Stanton also testified before the House Impeachment Committee  of 1867, that he had \"entertained no doubt of the authority of the  President to take measures for the reorganization of the rebel States  on the plan proposed, during the vacation of Congress, and agreed in the  plan specified in the proclamation in the case of North Carolina.\"    In the first attempt to impeach the President, in 1867, Mr. Johnson's  method of Reconstruction was the most conspicuous feature of the  prosecution. It was insisted by the extremists that it was a departure  from Mr. Lincoln's plan--an unwarranted assumption of authority by Mr.  Johnson--that its purpose was the recognition of the people of the South  as American citizens with the rights of such, and even as an act not  far removed from treason. In reference to this action of the President,  General Grant was called before the Committee and testified as follows:    Question: I wish to know whether, at or about the time of the war being  ended, you advised the President that it was, in your judgment, best to  extend a liberal policy towards the people of the South, and to restore  as speedily as possible the fraternal relations that existed prior to  the war between the sections?    Answer: I know that immediately after the close of the rebellion there  was a very fine feeling manifested in the South, and I thought we ought  to take advantage of it as soon as possible.    Ques. I understood you to say that Mr. Lincoln had inaugurated a policy  intended to restore these governments?    Ans. Yes Sir.    Ques. You were present when the subject was brought before the Cabinet?    Ans. I was present, I think, twice before the assassination of Mr.  Lincoln, when a plan was read.    Ques. I want to know whether the plan adopted by Mr. Johnson was  substantially the plan which had been inaugurated by Mr. Lincoln as the  basis for his future action.    Ans. Yes sir: substantially. I do not know but that it was verbatim the  same.    Ques. I suppose the very paper of Mr. Lincoln was the one acted on?    Ans. I should think so. I think that the very paper which I heard read  twice while Mr. Lincoln was President, was the one which was carried  right through.    Ques. What paper was that?    Ans. The North Carolina Proclamation.    In additional testimony that Mr. Johnson was endeavoring to carry out  Mr. Lincoln's methods of reconstruction, the following extracts from  a speech by Gov. O. P. Morton, of Indiana, delivered at Richmond, that  State, Sept. 29th, 1865, are here inserted:    An impression has gotten abroad in the North that Mr. Johnson has  devised some new policy by which improper facilities are granted for the  restoration of the rebel States, and that he is presenting improperly  and unnecessarily hurrying forward the work of reconstruction, and that  he is offering improper facilities for restoring those who have been  engaged in the rebellion to the possession of their civil and political  rights.    It is one of my purposes here this evening to show that so far as his  policy of amnesty and reconstruction is concerned, he has absolutely  presented nothing new, but that he has simply presented, and is simply  continuing THE POLICY WHICH MR. LINCOLN PRESENTED TO THE NATION ON THE  8TH OF DECEMBER, 1863. Mr. Johnson's policy differs from Mr. Lincoln's  in some restrictions it contains, which Mr. Lincoln's did not contain.  His plan of reconstruction is absolutely and simply that of Mr. Lincoln,  nothing more or less, with one difference only, that Mr. Lincoln  required that one-tenth of the people of the disloyal States should be  willing to embrace his plan of reconstruction, whereas Mr. Johnson says  nothing about the number; but, so far as it has been acted upon yet, it  has been done by a number much greater than one-tenth. * * * Their plans  of amnesty and reconstruction cannot be distinguished from each other  except in the particulars already mentioned, that Mr. Johnson proposed  to restrict certain persons from taking the oath, unless they have a  special pardon from him, whom Mr. Lincoln permitted to come forward and  take the oath without it. * * * That was Mr. Lincoln's policy at  the time he was nominated for re-election by the Union Convention at  Baltimore, last summer; and in that convention the party sustained him  and strongly endorsed his whole policy, of which this was a prominent  part. MR. LINCOLN WAS TRIUMPHANTLY AND OVERWHELMINGLY RE-ELECTED UPON  THAT POLICY.    In his last annual message to Congress, December, 1864, he again brings  forward this same policy of his, and presents it to the Nation.    Again, on the 12th of April, 1865, only two days before his death, he  referred to and presented this policy of amnesty and reconstruction.  That speech may be called his last speech, his dying words to his  people. It was after Richmond had been evacuated. It was the day after  they had received the news of Lee's surrender. Washington City was  illuminated. A large crowd came in front of the White House and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#9)"],[1,"on the subject. In the  experiments cited by Lang, the seers usually saw distant persons or  scenes, and he records his belief that \"experiments have proved beyond  doubt that a fair percentage of people, sane and healthy, can see vivid  landscapes, and figures of persons in motion, in glass balls and other  vehicles.\"    It can easily be imagined how interested any member of the Smith family  would have been in an exhibition like that of a \"crystal-gazer,\" and  we are able to trace very consecutively Joe's first introduction to the  practice, and the use he made of the hint thus given.    Emily C. Blackman, in the appendix to her \"History of Susquehanna  County, Pennsylvania\" (1873), supplies the needed important information  about Joe's visits to Pennsylvania in the years preceding the  announcement of his Bible. She says that it is uncertain when he arrived  at Harmony (now Oakland), \"but it is certain he was here in 1825 and  later.\" A very circumstantial account of Joe's first introduction to a  \"peep-stone\" is given in a statement by J. B. Buck in this appendix. He  says:--    \"Joe Smith was here lumbering soon after my marriage, which was in  1818, some years before he took to 'peeping', and before diggings were  commenced under his direction. These were ideas he gained later. The  stone which he afterward used was in the possession of Jack Belcher of  Gibson, who obtained it while at Salina, N. Y., engaged in drawing salt.  Belcher bought it because it was said to be a 'seeing-stone.' I have  often seen it. It was a green stone, with brown irregular spots on it.  It was a little longer than a goose's egg, and about the same thickness.  When he brought it home and covered it with a hat, Belcher's little boy  was one of the first to look into the hat, and as he did so, he said he  saw a candle. The second time he looked in he exclaimed, 'I've found my  hatchet' (it had been lost two years), and immediately ran for it to  the spot shown him through the stone, and it was there. The boy was soon  beset by neighbors far and near to reveal to them hidden things, and  he succeeded marvellously. Joe Smith, conceiving the idea of making  a fortune through a similar process of 'seeing,' bought the stone  of Belcher, and then began his operations in directing where hidden  treasures could be found. His first diggings were near Capt. Buck's  sawmill, at Red Rock; but because the followers broke the rule of  silence, 'the enchantment removed the deposit.'\"    One of many stories of Joe's treasure-digging, current in that  neighborhood, Miss Blackman narrates. Learning from a strolling Indian  of a place where treasure was said to be buried, Joe induced a farmer  named Harper to join him in digging for it and to spend a considerable  sum of money in the enterprise. \"After digging a great hole, that is  still to be seen,\" the story continues, \"Harper got discouraged, and was  about abandoning the enterprise. Joe now declared to Harper that there  was an 'enchantment' about the place that was removing the treasure  farther off; that Harper must get a perfectly white dog (some said  a black one), and sprinkle his blood over the ground, and that would  prevent the 'enchantment' from removing the treasure. Search was made  all over the country, but no perfectly white dog could be found. Then  Joe said a white sheep would do as well; but when this was sacrificed  and failed, he said The Almighty was displeased with him for attempting  to palm off on Him a white sheep for a white dog.\" This informant  describes Joe at that time as \"an imaginative enthusiast,  constitutionally opposed to work, and a general favorite with the  ladies.\"    In confirmation of this, R. C. Doud asserted that \"in 1822 he was  employed, with thirteen others, by Oliver Harper to dig for gold  under Joe's direction on Joseph McKune's land, and that Joe had begun  operations the year previous.\"    F. G. Mather obtained substantially the same particulars of Joe's  digging in connection with Harper from the widow of Joseph McKune about  the year 1879, and he said that the owner of the farm at that time \"for  a number of years had been engaged in filling the holes with stone  to protect his cattle, but the boys still use the northeast hole as a  swimming pond in the summer.\"*         * Lippincott's Magazine, August, 1880.      Confirmation of the important parts of these statements has been  furnished by Joseph's father. When the reports of the discovery of a new  Bible first gained local currency (in 1830), Fayette Lapham decided to  visit the Smith family, and learn what he could on the subject. He found  the elder Smith very communicative, and he wrote out a report of his  conversation with him, \"as near as I can repeat his words,\" he says, and  it was printed in the Historical Magazine for May, 1870. Father Smith  made no concealment of his belief in witchcraft and other things  supernatural, as well as in the existence of a vast amount of buried  treasure. What he said of Joe's initiation into \"crystal-gazing\" Mr.  Lapham thus records:--    \"His son Joseph, whom he called the illiterate,* when he was about  fourteen years of age, happened to be where a man was looking into a  dark stone, and telling people therefrom where to dig for money and  other things. Joseph requested the privilege of looking into the stone,  which he did by putting his face into the hat where the stone was. It  proved to be not the right stone for him; but he could see some things,  and among them he saw the stone, and where it was, in which he could see  whatever he wished to see.... The place where he saw the stone was not  far from their house, and under pretence of digging a well, they found  water and the stone at a depth of twenty or twenty-two feet. After this,  Joseph spent about two years looking into this stone, telling fortunes,  where to find lost things, and where to dig for money and other hidden  treasures.\"         * Joe's mother, describing Joe's descriptions to the family, at  their evening fireside, of the angel's revelations concerning the golden  plates, says (p. 84): \"All giving the most profound attention to a boy  eighteen years of age, who had never read the Bible through in his life;  he seemed much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the  rest of our children.\"    If further confirmation of Joe's early knowledge on this subject is  required, we may cite the Rev. John A. Clark, D.D., who, writing in 1840  after careful local research, said: \"Long before the idea of a golden  Bible entered their [the Smiths'] minds, in their excursions for  money-digging.... Joe used to be usually their guide, putting into a hat  a peculiar stone he had, through which he looked to decide where they  should begin to dig.\"*         * \"Gleanings by the Way\" (1842), p. 225.      We come now to the history of Joe's own \"peek-stone\" (as the family  generally called it), that which his father says he discovered by using  the one that he first saw. Willard Chase, of Manchester, New York, near  Palmyra, employed Joe and his brother Alvin some time in the year 1822  (as he fixed the date in his affidavit)* to assist him in digging a  well. \"After digging about twenty feet below the surface of the earth,\"  he says, \"we discovered a singularly appearing stone which excited my  curiosity. I brought it to the top of the well, and as we were examining  it, Joseph put it into his hat and then his face into the top of the  hat. It has been said by Smith that he brought the stone from the well,  but this is false. There was no one in the well but myself. The next  morning he came to me and wished to obtain the stone, alleging that  he could see in it; but I told him I did not wish to part with it on  account of its being a curiosity, but would lend it. After obtaining  the stone, he began to publish abroad what wonders he could discover by  looking in it, and made so much disturbance among the credulous part of  the community that I ordered the stone to be returned to me again.  He had it in his possession about two years.\" Joseph's brother Hyrum  borrowed the stone some time in 1825, and Mr. Chase was unable to  recover it afterward. Tucker describes it as resembling a child's foot  in shape, and \"of a whitish, glassy appearance, though opaque.\"**         * Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" p. 240.         ** Tucker closes his chapter about this stone with the  declaration \"that the origin [of Mormonism] is traceable to the  insignificant little stone found in the digging of Mr. Chase's well in  1822.\" Tucker was evidently ignorant both of Joe's previous experience  with \"crystal-gazing\" in Pennsylvania and of \"crystal-gazing\" itself.      The Smiths at once began turning Chase's stone to their own financial  account, but no one at the time heard that it was giving them any  information about revealed religion. For pay they offered to disclose by  means of it the location of stolen property and of buried money. There  seemed to be no limit to the exaggeration of their professions. They  would point out the precise spot beneath which lay kegs, barrels, and  even hogsheads of gold and silver in the shape of coin, bars, images,  candlesticks, etc., and they even asserted that all the hills thereabout  were the work of human bands, and that Joe, by using his \"peek-stone,\"  could see the caverns beneath them.* Persons can always be found to give  at least enough credence to such professions to desire to test them. It  was so in this case. Joe not only secured small sums on the promise of  discovering lost articles, but he raised money to enable him to dig for  larger treasure which he was to locate by means of the stone. A Palmyra  man, for instance, paid seventy-five cents to be sent by him on a fool's  errand to look for some stolen cloth.         * William Stafford's affidavit, Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" p.  237.
