The chance which had caused his  acquaintance with Madame de Lamotte, and even more the accident of  Brother Marchois appearing in the nick of time, to enlarge upon the  praises which gave him so excellent a character, seemed like favourable  omens not to be neglected. He began to imagine fresh villanies, to  outline an unheard-of crime, which as yet he could not definitely trace  out; but anyhow there would be plunder to seize and blood to spill, and  the spirit of murder excited and kept him awake, just as remorse might  have troubled the repose of another.    Meanwhile Madame de Lamotte, having retired with her husband, was saying  to the latter--    \"Well, now! what do you think of my protege, or rather, of the protector  which Heaven sent me?\"    \"I think that physiognomy is often very deceptive, for I should have  been quite willing to hang him on the strength of his.\"    \"It is true that his appearance is not attractive, and it led me into a  foolish mistake which I quickly regretted. When I recovered  consciousness, and saw him attending on me, much worse and more  carelessly dressed than he is to-day.\"    \"You were frightened?\"    \"No, not exactly; but I thought I must be indebted to a man of the  lowest class, to some poor fellow who was really starving, and my first  effort at gratitude was to offer him a piece of gold.\"    \"Did he refuse it?\"    \"No; he accepted it for the poor of the parish. Then he told me his  name, Cyrano Derues de Bury, and told me that the shop and the goods it  contained were his own property, and that he occupied an apartment in  the house. I floundered in excuses, but he replied that he blessed the  mistake, inasmuch as it would enable him to relieve some unfortunate  people. I was so touched with his goodness that I offered him a second  piece of gold.\"    \"You were quite right, my dear; but what induced you to bring him to  Buisson? I should have gone to see and thank him the first time I went  to Paris, and meanwhile a letter would have been sufficient. Did he  carry his complaisance and interest so far as to offer you his escort?\"    \"Ah! I see you cannot get over your first impression--honestly, is it  not so?\"    \"Indeed,\" exclaimed Monsieur de Lamotte, laughing heartily, \"it is truly  unlucky for a decent man to have such a face as that! He ought to give  Providence no rest until he obtains the gift of another countenance.\"    \"Always these prejudices! It is not the poor man's fault that he was  born like that.\"    \"Well, you said something about business we were to discuss together  --what is it?\"    \"I believe he can help us to obtain the money we are in want of.\"    \"And who told him that we wanted any?\"    \"I did.\"    \"You! Come, it certainly seems that this gentleman is to be a family  friend. And pray what induced you to confide in him to this extent?\"    \"You would have known by now, if you did not interrupt. Let me tell you  all in order. The day after my accident I went out with Edouard about  midday, and I went to again express my gratitude for his kindness. I was  received by Madame Derues, who told me her husband was out, and that he  had gone to my hotel to inquire after me and my son, and also to see if  anything had been heard of my stolen earrings. She appeared a simple and  very ordinary sort of person, and she begged me to sit down and wait for  her husband. I thought it would be uncivil not to do so, and Monsieur  Derues appeared in about two hours. The first thing he did, after having  saluted me and inquired most particularly after my health, was to ask  for his children, two charming little things, fresh and rosy, whom he  covered with kisses. We talked about indifferent matters, then he  offered me his services, placed himself at my disposal, and begged me to  spare neither his time nor his trouble. I then told him what had brought  me to Paris, and also the disappointments I had encountered, for of all  the people I had seen not one had given me a favourable answer. He said  that he might possibly be of some use to me, and the very next day told  'me that he had seen a capitalist, but could do nothing without more  precise information. Then I thought it might be better to bring him  here, so that he might talk matters over with you. When I first asked  him, he refused altogether, and only yielded to my earnest entreaties  and Edouard's. This is the history, dear, of the circumstances under  which I made Monsieur Derues' acquaintance. I hope you do not think I  have acted foolishly?\"    \"Very well,\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, \"I will talk to him to-morrow,  and in any case I promise you I will be civil to him. I will not forget  that he has been useful to you.\" With which promise the conversation  came to a close.    Skilled in assuming any kind of mask and in playing every sort of part,  Derues did not find it difficult to overcome Monsieur de Lamotte's  prejudices, and in order to obtain the goodwill of the father he made a  skilful use of the friendship which the, son had formed with him. One  can hardly think that he already meditated the crime which he carried  out later; one prefers to believe that these atrocious plots were not  invented so long beforehand. But he was already a prey to the idea, and  nothing henceforth could turn him from it. By what route he should  arrive at the distant goal which his greed foresaw, he knew not as yet,  but he had said to himself, \"One day this property shall be mine.\" It  was the death-warrant of those who owned it.    We have no details, no information as to Derues' first visit to  Buisson-Souef, but when he departed he had obtained the complete  confidence of the family, and a regular correspondence was carried on  between him and the Lamottes. It was thus that he was able to exercise  his talent of forgery, and succeeded in imitating the writing of this  unfortunate lady so as to be able even to deceive her husband. Several  months passed, and none of the hopes which Derues had inspired were  realised; a loan was always on the point of being arranged, and  regularly failed because of some unforeseen circumstance. These  pretended negotiations were managed by Derues with so much skill and  cunning that instead of being suspected, he was pitied for having so  much useless trouble. Meanwhile, Monsieur de Lamotte's money  difficulties increased, and the sale of Buisson-Souef became inevitable.  Derues offered himself as a purchaser, and actually acquired the  property by private contract, dated December, 1775. It was agreed  between the parties that the purchase-money of one hundred and thirty  thousand livres should not be paid until 1776, in order to allow Derues  to collect the various sums at his disposal. It was an important  purchase, which, he said, he only made on account of his interest in  Monsieur de Lamotte, and his wish to put an end to the latter's  difficulties.    But when the period agreed on arrived, towards the middle of 1776,  Derues found it impossible to pay. It is certain that he never meant to  do so; and a special peculiarity of this dismal story is the avarice of  the man, the passion for money which overruled all his actions, and  occasionally caused him to neglect necessary prudence. Enriched by three  bankruptcies, by continual thefts, by usury, the gold he acquired  promptly seemed to disappear. He stuck at nothing to obtain it, and once  in his grasp, he never let it go again. Frequently he risked the loss of  his character for honest dealing rather than relinquish a fraction of  his wealth. According to many credible people, it was generally believed  by his contemporaries that this monster possessed treasures which he had  buried in the ground, the hiding-place of which no one knew, not even  his wife. Perhaps it is only a vague and unfounded rumour, which should  be rejected; or is it; perhaps, a truth which failed to reveal itself?  It would be strange if after the lapse of half a century the  hiding-place were to open and give up the fruit of his rapine. Who knows  whether some of this treasure, accidentally discovered, may not have  founded fortunes whose origin is unknown, even to their possessors?    Although it was of the utmost importance not to arouse Monsieur de  Lamotte's suspicions just at the moment when he ought to be paying him  so large a sum, Derues was actually at this time being sued by his  creditors. But in those days ordinary lawsuits had no publicity; they  struggled and died between the magistrates and advocates without causing  any sound. In order to escape the arrest and detention with which he was  threatened, he took refuge at Buisson-Souef with his family, and  remained there from Whitsuntide till the end of November. After being  treated all this time as a friend, Derues departed for Paris, in order,  he said, to receive an inheritance which would enable him to pay the  required purchase-money.    This pretended inheritance was that of one of his wife's relations,  Monsieur Despeignes-Duplessis, who had been murdered in his country  house, near Beauvais. It has been strongly suspected that Derues was  guilty of this crime. There are, however, no positive proofs, and we  prefer only to class it as a simple possibility.    Derues had made formal promises to Monsieur de Lamotte, and it was no  longer possible for him to elude them. Either the payment must now be  made, or the contract annulled. A new correspondence began between the  creditors and the debtor; friendly letters were exchanged, full of  protestations on one side and confidence on the other. But all Derues'  skill could only obtain a delay of a few months. At length Monsieur de  Lamotte, unable to leave Buisson-Souef himself, on account of important  business which required his presence, gave his wife a power of attorney,  consented to another separation, and sent her to Paris, accompanied by  Edouard, and as if to hasten their misfortunes, sent notice of their  coming to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2749"],[0,"La Constantin (#9)"],[1,"in person. Not until the next day  did the sight of the displaced partition explain the apparition, but  even then so great was her fright, so deep was the terror which the  recollection of the mysterious man inspired, that despite the permission  to tell what had happened she mentioned her adventure to no one, and did  not even complain to her neighbour, Madame Rapally, of the  inquisitiveness which had led the widow to spy on her actions.          CHAPTER VI      We left de Jars and Jeannin, roaring with laughter, in the tavern in the  rue Saint Andre-des-Arts.    \"What!\" said the treasurer, \"do you really think that Angelique thought  I was in earnest in my offer?--that she believes in all good faith I  intend to marry her?\"    \"You may take my word for it. If it were not so, do you imagine she  would have been in such desperation? Would she have fainted at my threat  to tell you that I had claims on her as well as you? To get married!  Why, that is the goal of all such creatures, and there is not one of  them who can understand why a man of honour should blush to give her his  name. If you had only seen her terror, her tears! They would have either  broken your heart or killed you with laughter.\"    \"Well,\" said Jeannin, \"it is getting late. Are we going to wait for the  chevalier?\"    \"Let us call, for him.\"    \"Very well. Perhaps he has made up his mind to stay. If so, we shall  make a horrible scene, cry treachery and perjury, and trounce your  nephew well. Let's settle our score and be off.\"    They left the wine-shop, both rather the worse for the wine they had so  largely indulged in. They felt the need of the cool night air, so  instead of going down the rue Pavee they resolved to follow the rue  Saint-Andre-des-Arts as far as the Pont Saint-Michel, so as to reach the  mansion by a longer route.    At the very moment the commander got up to leave the tavern the  chevalier had run out of the mansion at the top of his speed. It was not  that he had entirely lost his courage, for had he found it impossible to  avoid his assailant it is probable that he would have regained the  audacity which had led him to draw his sword. But he was a novice in the  use of arms, had not reached full physical development, and felt that  the chances were so much against him that he would only have faced the  encounter if there were no possible way of escape. On leaving the house  he had turned quickly into the rue Git-le-Coeur; but on hearing the door  close behind his pursuer he disappeared down the narrow and crooked rue  de l'Hirondelle, hoping to throw the Duc de Vitry off the scent. The  duke, however, though for a moment in doubt, was guided by the sound of  the flying footsteps. The chevalier, still trying to send him off on a  false trail, turned to the right, and so regained the upper end of the  rue Saint-Andre, and ran along it as far as the church, the site of  which is occupied by the square of the same name to-day. Here he thought  he would be safe, for, as the church was being restored and enlarged,  heaps of stone stood all round the old pile. He glided in among these,  and twice heard Vitry searching quite close to him, and each time stood  on guard expecting an onslaught. This marching and counter-marching  lasted for some minutes; the chevalier began to hope he had escaped the  danger, and eagerly waited for the moment when the moon which had broken  through the clouds should again withdraw behind them, in order to steal  into some of the adjacent streets under cover of the darkness. Suddenly  a shadow rose before him and a threatening voice cried--    \"Have I caught you at last, you coward?\"    The danger in which the chevalier stood awoke in him a flickering  energy, a feverish courage, and he crossed blades with his assailant. A  strange combat ensued, of which the result was quite uncertain,  depending entirely on chance; for no science was of any avail on a  ground so rough that the combatants stumbled at every step, or struck  against immovable masses, which were one moment clearly lit up, and the  next in shadow. Steel clashed on steel, the feet of the adversaries  touched each other, several times the cloak of one was pierced by the  sword of the other, more than once the words \"Die then!\" rang out. But  each time the seemingly vanquished combatant sprang up unwounded, as  agile and as lithe and as quick as ever, while he in his turn pressed  the enemy home. There was neither truce nor pause, no clever feints nor  fencer's tricks could be employed on either side; it was a mortal  combat, but chance, not skill, would deal the death-blow. Sometimes a  rapid pass encountered only empty air; sometimes blade crossed blade  above the wielders' heads; sometimes the fencers lunged at each other's  breast, and yet the blows glanced aside at the last moment and the  blades met in air once more. At last, however, one of the two, making a  pass to the right which left his breast unguarded, received a deep  wound. Uttering a loud cry, he recoiled a step or two, but, exhausted by  the effort, tripped and fell backward over a large stone, and lay there  motionless, his arms extended in the form of a cross.    The other turned and fled.    \"Hark, de Jars!\" said Jeannin, stopping, \"There's fighting going on  hereabouts; I hear the clash of swords.\"    Both listened intently.    \"I hear nothing now.\"    \"Hush! there it goes again. It's by the church.\"    \"What a dreadful cry!\"    They ran at full speed towards the place whence it seemed to come, but  found only solitude, darkness, and silence. They looked in every  direction.    \"I can't see a living soul,\" said Jeannin, \"and I very much fear that  the poor devil who gave that yell has mumbled his last prayer.\"    \"I don't know why I tremble so,\" replied de Jars; \"that heart-rending  cry made me shiver from head to foot. Was it not something like the  chevalier's voice?\"    \"The chevalier is with La Guerchi, and even if he had left her this  would not have been his way to rejoin us. Let us go on and leave the  dead in peace.\"    \"Look, Jeannin! what is that in front of us?\"    \"On that stone? A man who has fallen!\"    \"Yes, and bathed in blood,\" exclaimed de Jars, who had darted to his  side. \"Ah! it's he! it's he! Look, his eyes are closed, his hands cold!  My child he does not hear me! Oh, who has murdered him?\"    He fell on his knees, and threw himself on the body with every mark of  the most violent despair.    \"Come, come,\" said Jeannin, surprised at such an explosion of grief from  a man accustomed to duels, and who on several similar occasions had been  far from displaying much tenderness of heart, \"collect yourself, and  don't give way like a woman. Perhaps the wound is not mortal. Let us try  to stop the bleeding and call for help.\"    \"No, no--\"    \"Are you mad?\"    \"Don't call, for Heaven's sake! The wound is here, near the heart. Your  handkerchief, Jeannin, to arrest the flow of blood. There--now help me  to lift him.\"    \"What does that mean?\" cried Jeannin, who had just laid his hand on the  chevalier. \"I don't know whether I'm awake or asleep! Why, it's a---\"    \"Be silent, on your life! I shall explain everything--but now be silent;  there is someone looking at us.\"    There was indeed a man wrapped in a mantle standing motionless some  steps away.    \"What are you doing here?\" asked de Jars.    \"May I ask what you are doing, gentlemen?\" retorted Maitre Quennebert,  in a calm and steady voice.    \"Your curiosity may cost you dear, monsieur; we are not in the habit of  allowing our actions to be spied on.\"    \"And I am not in the habit of running useless risks, most noble  cavaliers. You are, it is true, two against one; but,\" he added,  throwing back his cloak and grasping the hilts of a pair of pistols  tucked in his belt, \"these will make us equal. You are mistaken as to my  intentions. I had no thought of playing the spy; it was chance alone  that led me here; and you must acknowledge that finding you in this  lonely spot, engaged as you are at this hour of the night, was quite  enough to awake the curiosity of a man as little disposed to provoke a  quarrel as to submit to threats.\"    \"It was chance also that brought us here. We were crossing the square,  my friend and I, when we heard groans. We followed the sound, and found  this young gallant, who is a stranger to us, lying here, with a wound in  his breast.\"    As the moon at that moment gleamed doubtfully forth, Maitre Quennebert  bent for an instant over the body of the wounded man, and said:    \"I know him more than you. But supposing someone were to come upon us  here, we might easily be taken for three assassins holding a  consultation over the corpse of our victim. What were you going to do?\"    \"Take him to a doctor. It would be inhuman to leave him here, and while  we are talking precious time is being lost.\"    \"Do you belong to this neighbourhood?\"    \"No,\" said the treasurer.    \"Neither do I,\" said Quennebert. \"but I believe I have heard the name of  a surgeon who lives close by, in the rue Hauteville.\"    \"I also know of one,\" interposed de Jars, \"a very skilful man.\"    \"You may command me.\"    \"Gladly, monsieur; for he lives some distance from here.\"    \"I am at your service.\"    De Jars and Jeannin raised the chevalier's shoulders, and the stranger  supported his legs, and carrying their burden in this order, they set  off.    They walked slowly, looking about them carefully, a precaution rendered  necessary by the fact that the moon now rode in a cloudless sky. They  glided over the Pont Saint-Michel between the houses that lined both  sides, and, turning to the right, entered one of the narrow streets of  the Cite, and after many turnings, during which they met no one, they  stopped at the door of a house situated behind the Hotel-de-Ville.    \"Many thanks, monsieur,\" said de Jars,--\"many thanks; we need no further  help.\"    As the commander spoke, Maitre"]]]
