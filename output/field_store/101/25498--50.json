Among other nations, holes are made in the ears and pieces of  wood are inserted. The size of these pieces is gradually increased  until the lobe of the ear will hang down upon the shoulder and a piece  of wood as large as a man's arm be worn in the ears. All of these  things seem to us most horrible; yet, after all, they are not as much  an insult to the Divine Architect of the body as the deformity  practised by civilized and so-called Christian people, who by  restriction of the waist interfere with the vital organs and prevent  the body from being perfect in its development, or perfect in its  action. The activity of the body is an evidence of its life, and if it  is so tied up that it cannot be active, it certainly is not in the  fullest condition of life.          CHAPTER VIII.    EXERCISE.      You said to me, my daughter, that you wanted to join the class in  Physical Culture. I asked you why, and you said because you thought  you needed to build up in certain parts of the body. You were  defective in muscular development; you needed also to acquire grace,  you thought. And I said, \"Is muscular development the primary object  of physical education?\" You seemed to think that it is. Now I want to  talk to you a little along that line, and to demonstrate to you, if I  can, that physical education is not primarily for the building up of  big muscle, or for the gaining of power to do great feats of bodily  strength or skill. The object of physical education is to develop a  quickly responsive, flexible instrument for the soul to use, for that  is what the body is. Physical culture, rightly conducted, aims to  secure the highest condition of the body through the exercises that  are required by the laws of the body. Law, physical law, governs the  body, and exercise should be according to this law. The first object  of exercise is to make a vital supply for the whole body. This is  first secured by proper attitude. If we stand or sit properly we gain  a proper position of the vital organs, and then they will do their  work well, and the result will be more perfect nutrition.    The use of certain organs increases supply, and the use of others  quickens waste; a balance should be maintained between the two. We  must nourish the life-sustaining organs before using the organs which  use up brain-supply, therefore we want to be sure that we are working  according to these laws. A great many people have an idea that  physical culture means building up big muscle. They measure the  muscles of the arm and of the leg, and judge by their increase in size  of the value of the exercise. This is not a correct measurement.  Individuals may weigh themselves down by development of muscles until  they have not sufficient internal vital force to carry so much weight.  If we could only balance between the organs which supply nutriment and  the organs which use it up, we would keep in perfect health.    We want to learn how to secure a maximum of results with a minimum of  force. That is, we want the body to be quickly responsive, to be  flexible, to be so that we can use it for the things we want to do  without wasting strength, and yet without being weighed down by a  superabundance of muscular tissue.    The first desideratum in taking exercise is to have every organ of the  body free, therefore a gymnastic dress is a necessity. Then we should  have the exercise conducted by some one who understands the  peculiarities of each individual and knows just what exercises are  suited for her in her special physical condition. They should also be  directed by one who understands perfectly that the girl with an anaemic  brain, that is, with a brain having too little blood, cannot be  conducted on the same plan as the exercise of the girl who has a  superabundance of blood in the brain.    The best exercise is that which employs the mind pleasantly. A good  deal of exercise may be obtained in housework, and, if conducted with  pleasure in the work, may be of great physical advantage. Not long ago  I listened to a very charming talk by a lady whose dress betokened her  a woman of society. She wore white kid gloves, a dainty flower bonnet,  and in herself appeared an exponent of leisure and happiness. Her  address was entitled \"The Home Gymnasium,\" and I supposed that it  would consist of descriptions of machinery that could be put up in  one's own dwelling for gymnastic purposes, but I soon found that her  home gymnasium meant household duties. She said one could scrub the  table and obtain the best exercise for arms and chest, and at the same  time produce an article or piece of furniture which would be a delight  to the eye in its whiteness and brightness. She said that in  scrubbing the floor one obtained very much the same movement that  would be given in the gymnasium, while at the same time the exercise  would conduce not only to the personal advantage but to the happiness  of the family. She spoke of sweeping, and dusting, and bed-making, and  expressed herself as competent to do all these kinds of work, in fact,  as doing them. And she said she never felt more of a lady than when  scrubbing her kitchen floor, and she was not ashamed to be seen by her  friends at this work. If any one rang the door-bell, she said she  would simply put on a clean apron and go to the door, and remark  without hesitation that she was just scrubbing her kitchen floor, but  she was glad to see her friends.    This sort of a home gymnasium is at the command of nearly every girl,  and if she can bring herself to feel an interest in this home  gymnastic exercise, she may find it conducive not only to her own  physical well-being, but to the comfort and happiness of all about  her.    The question is often asked whether bicycle-riding is injurious for  girls, and I would say that in my opinion it depends largely upon the  girl. Has she good common sense? Of course I am speaking of the girl  who is in a normal condition of health. A girl of extreme delicacy, or  who is subject to some functional difficulty, or the victim of some  organic disease, might not find it advantageous to ride. A physician  should, in these cases, be consulted. But for the ordinary girl, the  girl of fairly good health, if she will learn how to sit properly upon  her saddle, will have the good sense to ride with judgment, it seems  to me that the exercise must be productive of great good.    My own experience is somewhat limited. I made some discoveries in my  attempts to ride. In the first place, I learned that it was important  to know how to sit. In reading a book on \"Physical Culture and Hygiene  for Women,\" by Dr. Anna Galbraith, I found this sentence: \"Sit upon  the gluteal muscles, and not upon the perineum.\" This was a revelation  to me. I found that I had been doing the thing which was not proper,  and bearing the weight almost entirely upon the perineum had caused  constant rectal irritation. The gluteal muscles, closely held  together, form a firm support for the body without injuring any of the  vital organs. I found that by distributing the weight--a little upon  the handle-bars, and some upon the feet--I was able to sit with less  weight and heaviness upon the saddle. I found, too, that it was quite  important to have the saddle high enough, so that the legs might be  fully extended at each stroke, and with these precautions I found the  wheel a source both of enjoyment and of strength.    The harm done by the wheel I believe in most instances to be due to  an ill-adapted saddle or a lack of good judgment in the amount of  exercise taken. It is such a fascinating exercise, one seems to be  flying and scarcely realizes how much of nerve-force is being  expended. If the girl learning to ride will be prudent, gauging the  amount of exercise by her amount of strength; if she will gradually  acquire the needed strength before attempting long wheeling trips; if  she will be judicious and not ride, perhaps, during the first two or  three days of menstruation, there seems to be no reason why the  ordinary girl should not be entirely benefited by this most delightful  form of exercise. It is not as objectionable, to any degree, as the  exercise of dancing. Dancing is a most fascinating amusement, and if  it only could be conducted under proper circumstances it would be very  delightful. In itself it is not so objectionable as in its  concomitants; the late hours, the improper dressing, the hearty  suppers in the middle of the night, the promiscuous association and  the undue familiarity of the attitude of the round dance are what make  dancing objectionable. If dancing could be conducted out of doors, in  the daylight, with intimate friends, without the round dances, only  those forms of dancing which may be likened to gymnastics, as the  contra-dance, the cotillion, the objections to dancing would be  largely removed, but I am of the opinion that a large share of the  fascination of dancing would go at the same time.    Skating is a delightful, invigorating form of exercise, if conducted  with judgment. One objection to it is that the girl will skate until  wearied, and then, in that exhausted condition, perhaps ride home, or  take a long, tiresome walk from the pond to her residence, all of  which is sapping her unduly and annulling the value of the skating as  an exercise.    Lawn-tennis is delightful and beneficial, provided it is undertaken  with due judgment and the girl is properly dressed. In fact, the  subject of dress is so closely associated with that of exercise that  they can never be considered separately. Even the moderate exercise of  walking, conducted in the dress of the fashionable woman, is in itself  an element of danger, whereas more violent exercise in a loose dress  becomes a means of increased strength and vigor.    I am often asked if girls should be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#9)"],[1,"them [for their  affection to me], I also advised them to fight with nobody, [19] nor to  spoil the country; but to pitch their tents in the plain, and be content  with their sustenance they had brought with them; for I told them that I  had a mind to compose these troubles without shedding any blood. Now it  came to pass, that on the very same day those who were sent by John with  letters, fell among the guards whom I had appointed to watch the roads;  so the men were themselves kept upon the place, as my orders were, but I  got the letters, which were full of reproaches and lies; and I intended  to fall upon these men, without saying a word of these matters to any  body.    48. Now, as soon as Jonathan and his companions heard of my coming, they  took all their own friends, and John with them, and retired to the house  of Jesus, which indeed was a large castle, and no way unlike a citadel;  so they privately laid a band of armed men therein, and shut all the  other doors but one, which they kept open, and they expected that I  should come out of the road to them, to salute them. And indeed they had  given orders to the armed men, that when I came they should let nobody  besides me come in, but should exclude others; as supposing that, by  this means, they should easily get me under their power: but they were  deceived in their expectation; for I perceived what snares they had laid  for me. Now, as soon as I was got off my journey, I took up my lodgings  over against them, and pretended to be asleep; so Jonathan and his  party, thinking that I was really asleep and at rest, made haste to go  down into the plain, to persuade the people that I was an ill governor.  But the matter proved otherwise; for, upon their appearance, there was  a cry made by the Galileans immediately, declaring their good opinion  of me as their governor; and they made a clamor against Jonathan and  his partners for coming to them when they had suffered no harm, and as  though they would overturn their happy settlement; and desired them by  all means to go back again, for that they would never be persuaded to  have any other to rule over them but myself. When I heard of this, I did  not fear to go down into the midst of them; I went, therefore, myself  down presently to hear what Jonathan and his companions said. As soon as  I appeared, there was immediately an acclamation made to me by the whole  multitude, and a cry in my commendation by them, who confessed their  thanks was owing to me for my good government of them.    49. When Jonathan and his companions heard this, they were in fear of  their own lives, and in danger lest they should be assaulted by the  Galileans on nay account; so they contrived how they might run away.  But as they were not able to get off, for I desired them to stay, they  looked down with concern at my words to them. I ordered, therefore, the  multitude to restrain entirely their acclamations, and placed the most  faithful of my armed men upon the avenues, to be a guard to us, lest  John should unexpected fall upon us; and I encouraged the Galileans to  take their weapons, lest they should be disturbed at their enemies,  if any sudden insult should be made upon them. And then, in the first  place, I put Jonathan and his partners in mind of their [former] letter,  and after what manner they had written to me, and declared they were  sent by the common consent to the people of Jerusalem, to make up the  differences I had with John, and how they had desired me to come to  them; and as I spake thus, I publicly showed that letter they had  written, till they could not at all deny what they had done, the letter  itself convicting them. I then said, \"O Jonathan! and you that are sent  with him as his colleagues, if I were to be judged as to my behavior,  compared with that of John's, and had brought no more than two or three  witnesses, [20] good men and true, it is plain you had been forced,  upon the examination of their characters beforehand, to discharge the  accusations: that therefore you may be informed that I have acted well  in the affairs of Galilee, I think three witnesses too few to be brought  by a man that hath done as he ought to do; so I gave you all these for  witnesses. Inquire of them [21] how I have lived, and whether I have  not behaved myself with all decency, and after a virtuous manner, among  them. And I further conjure you, O Galileans! to hide no part of the  truth, but to speak before these men as before judges, whether I have in  any thing acted otherwise than well.\"    50. While I was thus speaking, the united voices of all the people  joined together, and called me their benefactor and savior, and attested  to my former behavior, and exhorted me to continue so to do hereafter;  and they all said, upon their oaths, that their wives had been preserved  free from injuries, and that no one had ever been aggrieved by me. After  this, I read to the Galileans two of those epistles which had been sent  by Jonathan and his colleagues, and which those whom I had appointed to  guard the road had taken, and sent to me. These were full of reproaches,  and of lies, as if I had acted more like a tyrant than a governor  against them, with many other things besides therein contained, which  were no better indeed than impudent falsities. I also informed the  multitude how I came by these letters, and that those who carried them  delivered them up voluntarily; for I was not willing that my enemies  should know any thing of the guards I had set, lest they should be  afraid, and leave off writing hereafter.    51. When the multitude heard these things, they were greatly provoked  at Jonathan, and his colleagues that were with him, and were going to  attack them, and kill them; and this they had certainly done, unless  I had restrained the anger of the Galileans, and said, that \"I forgave  Jonathan and his colleagues what was past, if they would repent, and go  to their own country, and tell those who sent them the truth, as to  my conduct.\" When I had said this, I let them go, although I knew they  would do nothing of what they had promised. But the multitude were very  much enraged against them, and entreated me to give them leave to punish  them for their insolence; yet did I try all methods to persuade them to  spare the men; for I knew that every instance of sedition was pernicious  to the public welfare. But the multitude was too angry with them to  be dissuaded, and all of them went immediately to the house in which  Jonathan and his colleagues abode. However, when I perceived that  their rage could not be restrained, I got on horseback, and ordered the  multitude to follow me to the village Sogane, which was twenty furlongs  off Gabara; and by using this stratagem, I so managed myself, as not to  appear to begin a civil war amongst them.    52. But when I was come near Sogane, I caused the multitude to make a  halt, and exhorted them not to be so easily provoked to anger, and to  the inflicting such punishments as could not be afterwards recalled: I  also gave order, that a hundred men, who were already in years, and were  principal men among them, should get themselves ready to go to the city  of Jerusalem, and should make a complaint before the people of such as  raised seditions in the country. And I said to them, that \"in case they  be moved with what you say, you shall desire the community to write to  me, and to enjoin me to continue in Galilee, and to order Jonathan  and his colleagues to depart out of it.\" When I had suggested these  instructions to them, and while they were getting themselves ready as  fast as they could, I sent them on this errand the third day after they  had been assembled: I also sent five hundred armed men with them [as a  guard]. I then wrote to my friends in Samaria, to take care that they  might safely pass through the country: for Samaria was already under the  Romans, and it was absolutely necessary for those that go quickly [to  Jerusalem] to pass through that country; for in that road you may, in  three days' time, go from Galilee to Jerusalem. I also went myself, and  conducted the old men as far as the bounds of Galilee, and set guards in  the roads, that it might not be easily known by any one that these men  were gone. And when I had thus done, I went and abode at Japha.    53. Now Jonathan and his colleagues, having failed of accomplishing what  they would have done against me, sent John back to Gischala, but went  themselves to the city of Tiberias, expecting it would submit itself to  them; and this was founded on a letter which Jesus, their then governor,  had written them, promising that, if they came, the multitude would  receive them, and choose to be under their government; so they went  their ways with this expectation. But Silas, who, as I said, had been  left curator of Tiberias by me, informed me of this, and desired me to  make haste thither. Accordingly, I complied with his advice immediately,  and came thither; but found myself in danger of my life, from the  following occasion: Jonathan and his colleagues had been at Tiberias,  and had persuaded a great many of such as had a quarrel with me to  desert me; but when they heard of my coming, they were in fear for  themselves, and came to me; and when they had saluted me, they  said, that I was a happy man in having behaved myself so well in the  government of Galilee; and they congratulated me upon the honors that  were paid me: for they said that my glory was a credit to them, since  they had been my teachers and fellow citizens; and they said further,  that it was but just that they should prefer my friendship to them  rather than John's, and that they would have immediately gone home, but  that they staid that they might deliver up John into my power; and when  they said this they took their oaths of it, and those such as are most  tremendous amongst us, and such as I did not think"]]]
