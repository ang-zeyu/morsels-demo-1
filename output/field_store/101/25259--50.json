When there was any trouble  over titles in those days it was always settled by letting it revert to  the crown. It has been some years now, however, since that has happened  in this country.    Thirty-six years later New Jersey was set apart as a separate royal  province, and became a railroad terminus and bathing-place.    Delaware was settled by the Swedes at Wilmington first, and called New  Sweden. I am surprised that the Norsemen, who it is claimed made the  first and least expensive summer at Newport, R. I., should not have  clung to it.    [Illustration: CHEAPEST NEWPORT SEASON.]    They could have made a good investment, and in a few years would have  been strong enough to wipe out the Brooklyn police.    The Swedes, too, had a good foothold in New York, Jersey, and Delaware,  also a start in Pennsylvania. But the two nations seemed to yearn for  home, and as soon as boats began to run regularly to Stockholm and  Christiania, they returned. In later years they discovered Minneapolis  and Stillwater.    William Penn now loomed up on the horizon. He was an English Quaker who  had been expelled from Oxford and jugged in Cork also for his religious  belief. He was the son of Admiral Sir William Penn, and had a good  record. He believed that elocutionary prayer was unnecessary, and that  the acoustics of heaven were such that the vilest sinner with no  voice-culture could be heard in the remotest portion of the gallery.    The only thing that has been said against Penn with any sort of  semblance of truth was that he had some influence with James II. The  Duke of York also stood in with Penn, and used to go about in England  bailing William out whenever he was jailed on account of his religious  belief.    Penn was quite a writer (see Appendix). He was the author of \"No Cross,  No Crown,\" \"Innocency with her Open Face,\" and \"The Great Cause of  Liberty of Conscience.\"    From his father he had inherited a claim against the government for  sixteen thousand pounds, probably arrears of pension. He finally  received the State of Pennsylvania as payment of the claim. The western  boundary took in the Cliff House and Seal Rocks of San Francisco.    Penn came to America in 1682 and bought his land over again from the  Indians. It is not strange that he got the best terms he could out of  the Indians, but still it is claimed that they were satisfied, therefore  he did not cheat them.    The Indian, as will be noticed by reading these pages thoughtfully, was  never a Napoleon of finance. He is that way down to the present day. If  you watch him carefully and notice his ways, you can dicker with him to  better advantage than you can with Russell Sage.    Take the Indian just before breakfast after two or three nights of  debauchery, and offer him a jug of absinthe with a horned toad in it for  his pony and saddle, and you will get them. Even in his more sober and  thoughtful moments you can swap a suit of red medicated flannels with  him for a farm.    Penn gathered about him many different kinds of people, with various  sorts and shades of belief. Some were Free-Will and some were  Hard-Shell, some were High-Church and reminded one of a Masonic Lodge  working at 32 deg., while others were Low-Church and omitted crossing  themselves frequently while putting down a new carpet in the chancel.    [Illustration: A FEW OF PENN'S PEOPLE.]    But he was too well known at court, and suspected of knowledge of and  participation in some of the questionable acts of King James, so that  after the latter's dethronement, and an intimation that Penn had  communicated with the exiled monarch, Penn was deprived of his title to  Pennsylvania, for which he had twice paid.    Penn was a constant sufferer at the hands of his associates, who sought  to injure him in every way. He rounded out a life of suffering by  marrying the second time in 1695.    In 1708 he was on the verge of bankruptcy, owing to the villany and  mismanagement of his agent, and was thrown into Fleet Street Prison, a  jail in which he had never before been confined. His health gave way  afterwards, and this remarkable man died July 30, 1718.    Philadelphia was founded in 1683 and work begun on a beautiful building  known as the City Hall. Work has steadily progressed on this building  from time to time since then, and at this writing it is so near  completion as to give promise of being one of the most perfect  architectural jobs ever done by the hand of man.    In two years Philadelphia had sprung from a wilderness, where the rank  thistle nodded in the wind, to a town of over two thousand people,  exclusive of Indians not taxed. In three years it had gained more than  New York had in fifty years. This was due to the fact that the people  who came to Philadelphia had nothing to fear but the Indians, while  settlers in New York had not only the Indians to defend themselves  against, but the police also.    Penn and his followers established the great law that no one who  believed in Almighty God should be molested in his religious belief.  Even the Indians liked Penn, and when the nights were cold they would  come and crawl into his bed and sleep with him all night and not kill  him at all. The Great Chief of the Tribes, even, did not feel above  this, and the two used frequently to lie and talk for hours, Penn doing  the talking and the chief doing the lying.    It is said that, with all the Indian massacres and long wars between the  red men and the white, no drop of Quaker blood was ever shed. I quote  this from an historian who is much older than I, and with whom I do not  wish to have any controversy.    After Penn's death his heirs ran the Colony up to 1779, when they  disposed of it for five hundred thousand dollars or thereabouts, and the  State became the proprietor.    [Illustration: PENN AND THE BIG CHIEF.]    The seventeenth century must have been a very disagreeable period for  people who professed religion, for America from Newfoundland to Florida  was dotted with little settlements almost entirely made up of people who  had escaped from England to secure religious freedom at the risk of  their lives.    In 1634 the first settlement was made by young Lord Baltimore, whose  people, the Catholics, were fleeing from England to obtain freedom to  worship God as they believed to be right. Thus the Catholics were added  to the list of religious refugees,--viz., the Huguenots, the Puritans,  the Walloons, the Quakers, the Presbyterians, the Whigs, and the Menthol  Healers.    Terra Mariae, or Maryland, was granted to Lord Baltimore, as the  successor of his father, who had begun before his death the movement for  settling his people in America. The charter gave to all freemen a voice  in making the laws. Among the first laws passed was one giving to every  human being upon payment of poll-tax the right to worship freely  according to the dictates of his own conscience. America thus became the  refuge for those who had any peculiarity of religious belief, until  to-day no doubt more varieties of religion may be found here than almost  anywhere else in the world.    In 1635 the Virginia Colony and Lord Baltimore had some words over the  boundaries between the Jamestown and Maryland Colonies. Clayborne was  the Jamestown man who made the most trouble. He had started a couple of  town sites on the Maryland tract, plotted them, and sold lots to  Yorkshire tenderfeet, and so when Lord Baltimore claimed the lands  Clayborne attacked him, and there was a running skirmish for several  years, till at last the Rebellion collapsed in 1645 and Clayborne fled.    The Protestants now held the best hand, and outvoted the Catholics, so  up to 1691 there was a never-dying fight between the two, which must  have been entertaining to the unregenerate outsider who was taxed to pay  for a double set of legislators. This fight between the Catholics and  Protestants shows that intolerance is not confined to a monarchy.    In 1715 the fourth Lord Baltimore recovered the government by the aid of  the police, and religious toleration was restored. Maryland remained  under this system of government until the Revolution, which will be  referred to later on in the most thrilling set of original pictures and  word-paintings that the reader has ever met with.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR EXAMINATION.         _Q._ Who was William Penn?         _A._ He founded Pennsylvania.         _Q._ Was he a great fighter?         _A._ No. He was a peaceable man, and did not believe in killing men       or fighting.         _Q._ Would he have fought for a purse of forty thousand dollars?         _A._ No. He could do better buying coal lands of the Indians.         _Q._ What is religious freedom?         _A._ It is the art of giving intolerance a little more room.         _Q._ Who was Lord Baltimore?         _A._ See foregoing chapter.         _Q._ What do you understand by rebellion?         _A._ It is an unsuccessful attempt by armed subjects to overcome       the parent government.         _Q._ Is it right or wrong?         _A._ I do not know, but will go and inquire.          CHAPTER X.    THE EARLY ARISTOCRACY.      Lord Clarendon and several other noblemen in 1663 obtained from Charles  II. a grant of lands lying south of Virginia which they called Carolina  in honor of the king, whose name was not really Carolina. Possibly that  was his middle name, however, or his name in Latin.    The Albemarle Colony was first on the ground. Then there was a Carteret  Colony in 1670. They \"removed the ancient groves covered with yellow  jessamine\" on the Ashley, and began to build on the present site of  Charleston.    The historian remarks that the growth of this Colony was rapid from the  first. The Dutch, dissatisfied with the way matters were conducted in  New York, and worn out when shopping by the ennui and impudence "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145"],[0,"Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ (#9)"],[1,"in hand. On their left, reaching to  the south and east round Mount Zion, rose the city wall, and on  their right the steep prominences which form the western boundary  of the valley.    Slowly they passed the Lower Pool of Gihon, out of which the  sun was fast driving the lessening shadow of the royal hill;  slowly they proceeded, keeping parallel with the aqueduct from  the Pools of Solomon, until near the site of the country-house on  what is now called the Hill of Evil Counsel; there they began to  ascend to the plain of Rephaim. The sun streamed garishly over the  stony face of the famous locality, and under its influence Mary,  the daughter of Joachim, dropped the wimple entirely, and bared  her head. Joseph told the story of the Philistines surprised in  their camp there by David. He was tedious in the narrative,  speaking with the solemn countenance and lifeless manner of  a dull man. She did not always hear him.    Wherever on the land men go, and on the sea ships, the face and  figure of the Jew are familiar. The physical type of the race has  always been the same; yet there have been some individual variations.  \"Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly  to look to.\" Such was the son of Jesse when brought before Samuel.  The fancies of men have been ever since ruled by the description.  Poetic license has extended the peculiarities of the ancestor to  his notable descendants. So all our ideal Solomons have fair faces,  and hair and beard chestnut in the shade, and of the tint of gold in  the sun. Such, we are also made believe, were the locks of Absalom  the beloved. And, in the absence of authentic history, tradition has  dealt no less lovingly by her whom we are now following down to the  native city of the ruddy king.    She was not more than fifteen. Her form, voice, and manner belonged  to the period of transition from girlhood. Her face was perfectly  oval, her complexion more pale than fair. The nose was faultless;  the lips, slightly parted, were full and ripe, giving to the lines  of the mouth warmth, tenderness, and trust; the eyes were blue and  large, and shaded by drooping lids and long lashes; and, in harmony  with all, a flood of golden hair, in the style permitted to Jewish  brides, fell unconfined down her back to the pillion on which  she sat. The throat and neck had the downy softness sometimes  seen which leaves the artist in doubt whether it is an effect  of contour or color. To these charms of feature and person were  added others more indefinable--an air of purity which only the  soul can impart, and of abstraction natural to such as think much  of things impalpable. Often, with trembling lips, she raised her  eyes to heaven, itself not more deeply blue; often she crossed  her hands upon her breast, as in adoration and prayer; often she  raised her head like one listening eagerly for a calling voice.  Now and then, midst his slow utterances, Joseph turned to look  at her, and, catching the expression kindling her face as with  light, forgot his theme, and with bowed head, wondering, plodded on.    So they skirted the great plain, and at length reached the elevation  Mar Elias; from which, across a valley, they beheld Bethlehem,  the old, old House of Bread, its white walls crowning a ridge,  and shining above the brown scumbling of leafless orchards.  They paused there, and rested, while Joseph pointed out the  places of sacred renown; then they went down into the valley to  the well which was the scene of one of the marvellous exploits of  David's strong men. The narrow space was crowded with people and  animals. A fear came upon Joseph--a fear lest, if the town were  so thronged, there might not be house-room for the gentle Mary.  Without delay, he hurried on, past the pillar of stone marking the  tomb of Rachel, up the gardened slope, saluting none of the many  persons he met on the way, until he stopped before the portal of  the khan that then stood outside the village gates, near a junction  of roads.          CHAPTER IX      To understand thoroughly what happened to the Nazarene at the khan,  the reader must be reminded that Eastern inns were different from the  inns of the Western world. They were called khans, from the Persian,  and, in simplest form, were fenced enclosures, without house or  shed, often without a gate or entrance. Their sites were chosen  with reference to shade, defence, or water. Such were the inns  that sheltered Jacob when he went to seek a wife in Padan-Aram.  Their like may been seen at this day in the stopping-places of  the desert. On the other hand, some of them, especially those  on the roads between great cities, like Jerusalem and Alexandria,  were princely establishments, monuments to the piety of the kings  who built them. In ordinary, however, they were no more than the  house or possession of a sheik, in which, as in headquarters,  he swayed his tribe. Lodging the traveller was the least of  their uses; they were markets, factories, forts; places of  assemblage and residence for merchants and artisans quite as  much as places of shelter for belated and wandering wayfarers.  Within their walls, all the year round, occurred the multiplied  daily transactions of a town.    The singular management of these hostelries was the feature likely  to strike a Western mind with most force. There was no host or  hostess; no clerk, cook, or kitchen; a steward at the gate was all  the assertion of government or proprietorship anywhere visible.  Strangers arriving stayed at will without rendering account.  A consequence of the system was that whoever came had to bring  his food and culinary outfit with him, or buy them of dealers in  the khan. The same rule held good as to his bed and bedding, and  forage for his beasts. Water, rest, shelter, and protection were  all he looked for from the proprietor, and they were gratuities.  The peace of synagogues was sometimes broken by brawling disputants,  but that of the khans never. The houses and all their appurtenances  were sacred: a well was not more so.    The khan at Bethlehem, before which Joseph and his wife stopped,  was a good specimen of its class, being neither very primitive  nor very princely. The building was purely Oriental; that is  to say, a quadrangular block of rough stones, one story high,  flat-roofed, externally unbroken by a window, and with but one  principal entrance--a doorway, which was also a gateway, on the  eastern side, or front. The road ran by the door so near that  the chalk dust half covered the lintel. A fence of flat rocks,  beginning at the northeastern corner of the pile, extended many  yards down the slope to a point from whence it swept westwardly to  a limestone bluff; making what was in the highest degree essential  to a respectable khan--a safe enclosure for animals.    In a village like Bethlehem, as there was but one sheik, there could  not well be more than one khan; and, though born in the place,  the Nazarene, from long residence elsewhere, had no claim to  hospitality in the town. Moreover, the enumeration for which he  was coming might be the work of weeks or months; Roman deputies  in the provinces were proverbially slow; and to impose himself  and wife for a period so uncertain upon acquaintances or relations  was out of the question. So, before he drew nigh the great house,  while he was yet climbing the slope, in the steep places toiling to  hasten the donkey, the fear that he might not find accommodations in  the khan became a painful anxiety; for he found the road thronged  with men and boys who, with great ado, were taking their cattle,  horses, and camels to and from the valley, some to water, some to  the neighboring caves. And when he was come close by, his alarm  was not allayed by the discovery of a crowd investing the door  of the establishment, while the enclosure adjoining, broad as  it was, seemed already full.    \"We cannot reach the door,\" Joseph said, in his slow way. \"Let us  stop here, and learn, if we can, what has happened.\"    The wife, without answering, quietly drew the wimple aside. The look  of fatigue at first upon her face changed to one of interest. She  found herself at the edge of an assemblage that could not be other  than a matter of curiosity to her, although it was common enough  at the khans on any of the highways which the great caravans were  accustomed to traverse. There were men on foot, running hither and  thither, talking shrilly and in all the tongues of Syria; men on  horseback screaming to men on camels; men struggling doubtfully  with fractious cows and frightened sheep; men peddling bread and  wine; and among the mass a herd of boys apparently in chase of a  herd of dogs. Everybody and everything seemed to be in motion at  the same time. Possibly the fair spectator was too weary to be long  attracted by the scene; in a little while she sighed, and settled  down on the pillion, and, as if in search of peace and rest, or in  expectation of some one, looked off to the south, and up to the  tall cliffs of the Mount of Paradise, then faintly reddening under  the setting sun.    While she was thus looking, a man pushed his way out of the press,  and, stopping close by the donkey, faced about with an angry brow.  The Nazarene spoke to him.    \"As I am what I take you to be, good friend--a son of Judah--may  I ask the cause of this multitude?\"    The stranger turned fiercely; but, seeing the solemn countenance  of Joseph, so in keeping with his deep, slow voice and speech,  he raised his hand in half-salutation, and replied,    \"Peace be to you, Rabbi! I am a son of Judah, and will answer you.  I dwell in Beth-Dagon, which, you know, is in what used to be the  land of the tribe of Dan.\"    \"On the road to Joppa from Modin,\" said Joseph.    \"Ah, you have been in Beth-Dagon,\" the man said, his face softening  yet more. \"What wanderers we of Judah are! I have been away from  the ridge--ol"]]]
