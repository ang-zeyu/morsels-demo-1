Now it seemed to her that she cared no more for one than for the other,  and that her best plan therefore was to place in the position of heir  whichever of them was most likely to suit her purpose. But here, again,  she was in a difficulty. If they resembled each other in no other point,  they both looked thoroughly manly, straightforward, and honest lads,  neither of whom would be likely to entertain any dishonourable  proposition. Her intention had been to say to her son, \"You are not  really the twin brother, as you suppose, of the other. Captain and Mrs.  Clinton do not know which of you two is their child.\" She wondered  whether they already knew as much as that. Probably they did. So many  people had known of that affair at Agra, that Captain Clinton had  probably told them himself. She would tell the boy, \"I am the only  person in the world who can clear up the mystery. I have the key to it  in my hand, and can place either you or the other in the position of  sole heir to the estate. I shall expect to be paid a handsome sum from  the one I put into possession. Remember, on one hand I can give you a  splendid property, on the other I can show you to have been from the  first a usurper of things you had no right to--an interloper and a  fraud.\"    It had seemed to her a simple matter before she came down to Cheltenham.  Surely no boy in his senses would hesitate a moment in accepting her  offer. It had always been a fixed thing in her mind that this would be  so, but now she felt that it was not so certain as she before imagined.  She hesitated whether she should not defer it until the boys came of  age, and the one she chose could sign a legal document; but she was  anxious to leave England, and go right away to America or Australia.  Besides, if she had the promise she could enforce its fulfilment. Which  boy should she select? She changed her mind several times, and at last  determined that she would leave it to chance, and would choose the one  whom she next met.    It chanced that Edgar was the first she encountered after having taken  this resolution, and it happened that he was walking by himself, having  remained in the class-room a few minutes after the rest of the boys had  left, to speak to the master respecting a difficult passage in a lesson.  The woman placed herself in his way.    \"Well, what is it?\" he said. \"You have been hanging about for the last  week. What is it you want?\"    \"I want to speak to you about something very important.\"    \"Oh, nonsense!\" he said. \"There is nothing important you can have to  tell me.\"    \"Yes, there is; something of the greatest importance. You do not suppose  that I should have been here for a week waiting to tell it to you, if it  was not.\"    \"Well, I suppose you think it important,\" he said; \"so fire away.\"    \"I cannot tell you now,\" she said; \"it is too long a story. Could you  spare me half an hour, young sir? You will not be sorry for it  afterwards, I promise you.\"    Edgar looked impatiently at his watch. He had nothing particular to do  at the moment, and his curiosity was excited. \"I can spare it you now,\"  he said.    \"I am staying at this address,\" she said, handing him a piece of paper.  \"It is not five minutes' walk from here. I will go on, if you will  follow me.\"    \"All right,\" Edgar said, looking at the paper; \"though I expect it is  some fooling or other.\" She walked away rapidly, and he sauntered after  her. She was standing with the door open when he arrived, and he  followed her into a small parlour. He threw himself down into a chair.    \"Now, fire away,\" he said; \"and be as quick as you can.\"    \"Before I begin,\" she said quietly, \"will you tell me if you know  anything relating to the circumstances of your birth?\"    [Illustration: \"THE WOMAN PLACED HERSELF IN HIS WAY.\"]    He looked at her in astonishment. \"No,\" he said. \"What in the world  should I know about the circumstances of my birth?\"    \"You know that you were born at Agra in India?\"    \"Of course I know that.\"    \"And your father, Captain Clinton, has never spoken to you about the  circumstances?\"    Edgar shook his head. \"No; I only know that I was born there.\"    \"I should have thought that he would have told you the story,\" she said;  \"for there were many knew of it, and you would be sure to hear it sooner  or later.\"    \"I do not want to hear of it,\" he said, leaping to his feet. \"If there  was anything my father wanted me to know he would tell it to me at once.  You do not suppose I want to hear it from anyone else?\"    He was making for the door, when she said, \"Then you do not know that  you are not his son?\"    He stopped abruptly. \"Don't know I am not his son!\" he repeated. \"You  must be mad.\"    \"I am not mad at all,\" she said. \"You are not his son. Not any relation  in the world to him. Sit down again and I will tell you the story.\"    He mechanically obeyed, feeling overwhelmed with the news he had heard.  Then as she told him how the children had become mixed, and how Captain  Clinton had decided to bring them up together until he should be able to  discover by some likeness to himself or wife which was his son, Edgar  listened to the story with a terrible feeling of oppression stealing  over him. He could not doubt that she was speaking the truth, for if it  were false it could be contradicted at once. There were circumstances  too which seemed to confirm it. He recalled now, that often in their  younger days his father and mother had asked casual visitors if they saw  any likeness between either of the children to them; and he specially  remembered how closely Colonel Winterbottom, who had been major in his  father's regiment, had scrutinized them both, and how he had said, \"No,  Clinton, for the life of me I cannot see that one is more like you and  your wife than the other.\" And now this woman had told him that he was  not their son; and he understood that she must be this sergeant's wife,  and that if he was not Captain Clinton's son she must be his mother.    \"You are Mrs. Humphreys, I suppose?\" he said in a hard, dry voice when  she had ceased speaking.    \"I am your mother,\" she said. He moved as if struck with sudden pain as  she spoke, but said nothing.    \"I sacrificed myself for your sake,\" she went on after a pause. \"I had  them both, and it seemed to me hard that my boy should grow up to be a  boy of the regiment, with nothing better to look forward to than to  enlist in it some day, while the other, no better in any respect than  him, should grow up to be a rich man, with everything the heart could  desire, and I determined that he should have an equal chance with the  other. I knew that perhaps some day they might find out which was which  by a likeness, but that was not certain, and at any rate you would get a  good education and be well brought up, and you were sure to be provided  for, and when the time should come, if there was still doubt, I could  give you the chance of either having the half or all just as you chose.  It was terrible for me to give you up altogether, but I did it for your  good. I suffered horribly, and the women of the regiment turned against  me. Your father treated me badly, and I had to leave him and come home  to England. But my comfort has all along been that I had succeeded; that  you were being brought up as a gentleman, and were happy and well cared  for.\"    Edgar sat silent for some time. \"How do you know,\" he asked suddenly,  \"that it is Rupert and not I who is the real son?\"    \"One of the infants,\" she said, \"had a tiny mole no bigger than a pin's  head on his shoulder, and I was sure that I would always know them apart  from that.\"    \"Yes, Rupert has a mark like that,\" Edgar admitted, for he had noticed  it only a short time before.    \"Yes,\" the woman said quietly. \"Mrs. Clinton's child had that mark. It  was very, very small and scarcely noticeable, but as I washed and  dressed them when babies, I noticed it.\"    \"Well, what next?\" Edgar asked roughly.    \"As I said, my boy,\"--Edgar winced as she spoke--\"it is for you to  choose whether you will have half or all the property. If I hold my  tongue you will go on as you are now, and they will never know which is  their son. If you like to have it all, to be the heir of that grand  place and everything else, I have only to go and say that my boy had a  mole on his shoulder. There is nothing I would not do to make you  happy.\"    \"And I suppose,\" Edgar said quietly, \"you will want some money for  yourself?\"    \"I do not wish to make any bargain, if that is what you mean,\" she said  in an indignant tone. \"I know, of course, that you can give me no money  now. I suppose that in either case you would wish to help a mother who  has done so much for you. I don't expect gratitude at present. Naturally  you are upset about what I have told you. Some day when you grow to be a  man you will appreciate better than you can now what I have done for  you, and what you have gained by it.\"    Edgar sat silent for a minute or two, and then he rose quietly and said,  \"I will think it all over. You shall have my answer in a day or two,\"  and without another word left the room and sauntered off.    \"What is the matter, Edgar?\" Rupert asked two hours later. \"I have been  looking for you everywhere, and young Johnson has only just said that  you told him to tell me you were feeling very seedy, and were going to  lie down for a bit.\"    \"I have got a frightful headache, Rupert,\" Edgar, who was lying with  his face to the wall, said. \"I am too bad to talk, old fellow; let me  alone. I daresay I shall be all right when I have had a night's sleep.  Tell River-Smith, will you, that I am seedy, and cannot come down to  tea.

These consist of a long  cylinder which fits closely to the leg, being made in two halves which  lock into each other, while at each end and in the centre circular  plates project outwards horizontally. A pair of these _churas_ may  weigh 8 or 10 lbs., and cost from Rs. 3 to Rs. 9. It is probable that  some important magical advantage was expected to come from the wearing  of these heavy appendages, which must greatly impede free progression,  but its nature is not known.        19. Occupation.      Only about thirty per cent of the Ahirs are still occupied in breeding  cattle and dealing in milk and butter. About four per cent are domestic  servants, and nearly all the remainder cultivators and labourers. In  former times the Ahirs had the exclusive right of milking the cow,  so that on all occasions an Ahir must be hired for this purpose even  by the lowest castes. Any one could, however, milk the buffalo, and  also make curds and other preparations from cow's milk. [28] This  rule is interesting as showing how the caste system was maintained  and perpetuated by the custom of preserving to each caste a monopoly  of its traditional occupation. The rule probably applied also to the  bulk of the cultivating and the menial and artisan castes, and now  that it has been entirely abrogated it would appear that the gradual  decay and dissolution of the caste organisation must follow. The  village cattle are usually entrusted jointly to one or more herdsmen  for grazing purposes. The grazier is paid separately for each animal  entrusted to his care, a common rate being one anna for a cow or  bullock and two annas for a buffalo per month. When a calf is born  he gets four annas for a cow-calf and eight annas for a she-buffalo,  but except in the rice districts nothing for a male buffalo-calf, as  these animals are considered useless outside the rice area. The reason  is that buffaloes do not work steadily except in swampy or wet ground,  where they can refresh themselves by frequent drinking. In the northern  Districts male buffalo-calves are often neglected and allowed to die,  but the cow-buffaloes are extremely valuable, because their milk is  the principal source of supply of _ghi_ or boiled butter. When a cow  or buffalo is in milk the grazier often gets the milk one day out  of four or five. When a calf is born the teats of the cow are first  milked about twenty times on to the ground in the name of the local  god of the Ahirs. The remainder of the first day's milk is taken by  the grazier, and for the next few days it is given to friends. The  village grazier is often also expected to prepare the guest-house for  Government officers and others visiting the village, fetch grass for  their animals, and clean their cooking vessels. For this he sometimes  receives a small plot of land and a present of a blanket annually  from the village proprietor. Malguzars and large tenants have their  private herdsmen. The pasturage afforded by the village waste lands  and forest is, as a rule, only sufficient for the plough-bullocks and  more valuable milch-animals. The remainder are taken away sometimes  for long distances to the Government forest reserves, and here the  herdsmen make stockades in the jungle and remain there with their  animals for months together. The cattle which remain in the village are  taken by the owners in the early morning to the _khirkha_ or central  standing-ground. Here the grazier takes them over and drives them out  to pasture. He brings them back at ten or eleven, and perhaps lets them  stand in some field which the owner wants manured. Then he separates  the cows and milch-buffaloes and takes them to their masters' houses,  where he milks them all. In the afternoon all the cattle are again  collected and driven out to pasture. The cultivators are very much in  the grazier's hands, as they cannot supervise him, and if dishonest he  may sell off a cow or calf to a friend in a distant village and tell  the owner that it has been carried off by a tiger or panther. Unless  the owner succeeds by a protracted search or by accident in finding  the animal he cannot disprove the herdsman's statement, and the only  remedy is to dispense with the latter's services if such losses become  unduly frequent. On this account, according to the proverbs, the Ahir  is held to be treacherous and false to his engagements. They are also  regarded as stupid because they seldom get any education, retain their  rustic and half-aboriginal dialect, and on account of their solitary  life are dull and slow-witted in company. 'The barber's son learns to  shave on the Ahir's head.' 'The cow is in league with the milkman and  lets him milk water into the pail.' The Ahirs are also hot-tempered,  and their propensity for drinking often results in affrays, when they  break each other's head with their cattle-staffs. 'A Gaoli's quarrel:  drunk at night and friends in the morning.'        20. Preparations of milk.      Hindus nearly always boil their milk before using it, as the taste  of milk fresh from the cow is considered unpalatable. After boiling,  the milk is put in a pot and a little old curds added, when the whole  becomes _dahi_ or sour curds. This is a favourite food, and appears  to be exactly the same substance as the Bulgarian sour milk which is  now considered to have much medicinal value. Butter is also made by  churning these curds or _dahi_. Butter is never used without being  boiled first, when it becomes converted into a sort of oil; this  has the advantage of keeping much better than fresh butter, and may  remain fit for use for as long as a year. This boiled butter is known  as _ghi_, and is the staple product of the dairy industry, the bulk  of the surplus supply of milk being devoted to its manufacture. It  is freely used by all classes who can afford it, and serves very well  for cooking purposes. There is a comparatively small market for fresh  milk among the Hindus, and as a rule only those drink milk who obtain  it from their own animals. The acid residue after butter has been  made from _dahi_ (curds) or milk is known as _matha_ or butter-milk,  and is the only kind of milk drunk by the poorer classes. Milk boiled  so long as to become solidified is known as _khir_, and is used by  confectioners for making sweets. When the milk is boiled and some sour  milk added to it, so that it coagulates while hot, the preparation is  called _chhana_. The whey is expressed from this by squeezing it in a  cloth, and a kind of cheese is obtained. [29] The liquid which oozes  out at the root of a cow's horns after death is known as _gaolochan_  and sells for a high price, as it is considered a valuable medicine  for children's cough and lung diseases.        Andh      _Andh._ [30]--A low cultivating caste of Berar, who numbered 52,000  persons in 1911, and belong to the Yeotmal, Akola and Buldana  Districts. The Andhs appear to be a non-Aryan tribe of the Andhra or  Tamil country, from which they derive their name. The territories  of the Andhra dynasty extended across southern India from sea to  sea in the early part of the Christian era. This designation may,  however, have been given to them after migration, emigrants being not  infrequently called in their new country by the name of the place from  which they came, as Berari, Purdesi, Audhia (from Oudh), and so on. At  present there seems to be no caste called Andh in Madras. Mr. Kitts  [31] notes that they still come from Hyderabad across the Penganga  river.    The caste are divided into two groups, Vartati or pure and Khaltati or  illegitimate, which take food together, but do not intermarry. They  have a large number of exogamous septs, most of which appear to have  Marathi names, either taken from villages or of a titular character. A  few are called after animals or plants, as Majiria the cat, Ringni  a kind of tree, Dumare from Dumar, an ant-hill, Dukare from Dukar,  a pig, and Titawe from Titawa, a bird. Baghmare means tiger-killer  or one killed by a tiger; members of this sept revere the tiger. Two  septs, Bhoyar and Wanjari, are named after other castes.    Marriage between members of the same sept is prohibited, and also  between first cousins, except that a sister's son may marry a brother's  daughter. Until recently marriage has been adult, but girls are now  wedded as children, and betrothals are sometimes arranged before they  are born. The ceremony resembles that of the Kunbis. Betrothals are  arranged between October and December, and the weddings take place  three or four months later, from January to April. If the bride is  mature she goes at once to her husband's house. Polygamy is allowed;  and as only a well-to-do man can afford to obtain more than one wife,  those who have several are held to be wealthy, and treated with  respect. Divorce and the remarriage of widows are permitted, but  the widow may not marry her husband's brother nor any member of his  clan. If an unmarried girl becomes pregnant by a man of her own or a  superior caste she is fined, and can then be married as a widow. Her  feet are not washed nor besmeared with red powder at the wedding  ceremony like those of other girls. In some localities Andh women  detected in a criminal intimacy even with men of such impure castes  as the Mahars and Mangs have been readmitted into the community. A  substantial fine is imposed on a woman detected in adultery according  to her means and spent on a feast to the caste. All the members thus  have a personal interest in the detection and punishment of such  offences. The dead are usually buried, and water and sugar are placed  in a dying man's mouth instead of the sacred objects used by Hindus;  nor are the dying urged to call on Rama. The dead are buried with  the head to the south, in opposition to the Hindu custom. The Andhs"]]]
