The influence of  these lowered temperatures makes it possible to ship milk long  distances[43] by rail for city supplies, if the temperature is kept low  during transit.    ~Mixing night and morning milk.~ Not infrequently it happens when old milk  is mixed with new, that the course of the fermentative changes is more  rapid than would have been the case if the two milks had been kept  apart. Thus, adding the cooled night milk to the warm morning milk  sometimes produces more rapid changes in both. The explanation for this  often imperfectly understood phenomenon is that germ growth may have  gone on in the cooled milk, and when this material is added to the  warmer, but bacteria-poor, fresh milk, the temperature of the whole mass  is raised to a point suitable for the more rapid growth of all bacteria  than would have occurred if the older milk had been kept chilled.    ~Number of bacteria in milk.~ The number of organisms found in milk  depends upon (1) the original amount of contamination, (2) the age of  the milk, and (3) the temperature at which it has been held. These  factors all fluctuate greatly in different cases; consequently, the germ  life is subject to exceedingly wide variations. Here in America, milk  reaches the consumer with less bacteria than in Europe, although it may  often be older. This is due largely to the more wide-spread use of ice  for chilling the milk _en route_ to market. Examinations have been made  of various supplies with the following results: Sedgwick and Batchelder  found in 57 tests of Boston milk from 30,000-4,220,000 per cc. Jordan  and Heineman found 30% of samples of Chicago milk to range from 100,000  to 1,000,000 while nearly one half were from 1-20,000,000 per cc. The  germ content of city milks increase rapidly in the summer months.  Park[44] found 250,000 organisms per cc. in winter, about 1,000,000 in  cool weather and 5,000,000 per cc. in hot summer weather. Knox and  Bassett in Baltimore report 1,500,000 in spring and nearly 4,500,000 in  summer. Eckles[45] studied milk under factory conditions. He finds from  1,000,000 to 5,000,000 per cc. in winter, and in summer from 15-30  millions.    ~Bacterial standards for city supplies.~ It would be very desirable to  have a hygienic standard for city milk supplies, as there is a butter  fat and milk-solid test, but the wide spread variation in germ content  and the impracticability of utilizing ordinary bacterial determinations  (on account of time required) makes the selection of such a standard  difficult. Some hold, as Park, that such a standard is feasible. The New  York City Milk commission has set a standard of 30,000 bacteria per cc.  for their certified milk and 100,000 per cc. for inspected milk.  Rochester, N. Y. has attempted the enforcement of such a standard  (limit, 100,000 per cc.) with good results it is claimed while Boston  has placed the legal limit at 500,000 per cc. Quantitative standards  would seem more applicable to \"certified\" or sanitary supplies than to  general city supplies, where the wide range in conditions lead to such  enormous variations that the bacterial standard seems too refined a  method for practical routine inspection.    ~Other tests.~ Any test to be of much service must be capable of being  quickly applied. The writer believes for city milk inspectors that the  acid test would serve a very useful purpose. This test measures the  acidity of the milk. There is, of course, no close and direct  relationship between the development of acidity and the growth of  bacteria, yet in a general way one follows the other at normal  temperatures. Where the temperature is kept rather low, bacterial growth  might go on without much acid development, but in the great majority of  cases a high degree of acidity means either old milk, in which there has  been a long period of incubation, or high temperature, where rapid  bacterial growth has been possible. Either of these conditions  encourages germ growth and thus impairs the quality of the milk.    The rapid determination of acidity may be made in an approximate manner  so as to serve as a test at the weigh-can or intake. The test is best  made by the use of the well known alkaline tablet which is composed of a  solid alkali, and the indicator, phenolphthalein. The tablets are  dissolved in water, one to each ounce used. A number of white cups are  filled with the proper quantity of the solution necessary to neutralize  say, 0.2 per cent. lactic acid. Then, as the milk is delivered, the  proper quantity is taken from each can to which is added the tablet  solution. A retention of the pink color shows that there is not  sufficient acid in the milk to neutralize the alkali used; a  disappearance of color indicates an excess of acid. The standard  selected is of course arbitrarily chosen. In our experience, 0.2 per  cent. acidity (figured as lactic), has proven a satisfactory point. With  carefully handled milk the acidity ought to be reduced to about 0.15 per  cent. The acidity of the milk may be abnormally reduced if milk is kept  in rusty cans, owing to action of acid on the metal.    [Illustration: FIG. 15. Apparatus used in making rapid acid test. A  definite quantity of the alkali solution and indicator is placed in the  white tea cup. To this is added the quantity of milk by means of the  cartridge measure which would just be neutralized if the acidity was 0.2  per cent. A retention of the pink color shows a low acid milk; its  disappearance, a high acid milk.]    ~Kinds of bacteria in milk.~ The number of bacteria in milk is not of so  much consequence as the kinds present. With reference to the number of  different species, the more dirt and foreign matter the milk contains,  the larger the number of varieties found in the same. While milk may  contain forms that are injurious to man, still the great majority of  them have no apparent effect on human health. In their effect on milk,  the case is much different. Depending upon their action in milk, they  may be grouped into three classes:    1. Inert group, those producing no visible change in the milk.    2. Sour milk forms, those breaking up the milk sugar with or without the  formation of gas.    3. Digesting or peptonizing group, those capable of rendering the casein  of milk soluble and more or less completely digested.    A surprisingly large number of bacteria that are found in milk belong to  the first class. Undoubtedly they affect the chemical characteristics of  the milk somewhat, but not to the extent that it becomes physically  perceptible. Eckles[46] reports in a creamery supply from 20 to 55 per  cent. of entire flora as included in this class.    By far the most important group is that embraced under the second head.  It includes not only the true lactic acid types in which no gas is  formed, but those species capable of producing gases and various kinds  of acids. These organisms are the distinctively milk bacteria, although  they do not predominate when the milk is first drawn. Their adaptation  to this medium is normally shown, however, by this extremely rapid  growth, in which they soon gain the ascendency over all other species  present. It is to this lactic acid class that the favorable  flavor-producing organisms belong which are concerned in butter-making.  They are also indispensable in cheese-making.    The third class represents those capable of producing a liquefied or  digested condition on gelatin or in milk. They are usually the  spore-bearing species which gain access from filth and dirt. Their high  powers of resistance due to spores makes it difficult to eradicate this  type, although they are materially held in subjection by the lactic  bacteria. The number of different kinds that have been found in milk is  quite considerable, something over 200 species having been described  more or less thoroughly. In all probability, however, many of these  forms will be found to be identical when they are subjected to a more  critical study.    ~Direct absorption of taints.~ A tainted condition in milk may result from  the development of bacteria, acting upon various constituents of the  milk, and transforming these in such a way as to produce by-products  that impair the flavor or appearance of the liquid; or it may be  produced by the milk being brought in contact with any odoriferous or  aromatic substance, under conditions that permit of the direct  absorption of such odors.    This latter class of taints is entirely independent of bacterial action,  and is largely attributable to the physical property which milk  possesses of being able to absorb volatile odors, the fat in particular,  having a great affinity for many of these substances. This direct  absorption may occur before the milk is withdrawn from the animal, or  afterwards if exposed to strong odors.    It is not uncommon for the milk of animals advanced in lactation to have  a more or less strongly marked odor and taste; sometimes this is apt to  be bitter, at other times salty to the taste. It is a defect that is  peculiar to individual animals and is liable to recur at approximately  the same period in lactation.    The peculiar \"cowy\" or \"animal odor\" of fresh milk is an inherent  peculiarity that is due to the direct absorption of volatile elements  from the animal herself. This condition is very much exaggerated when  the animal consumes strong-flavored substances as garlic, leeks, turnips  and cabbage. The volatile substances that give to these vegetables their  characteristic odor are quickly diffused through the system, and if such  foods are consumed some few hours before milking, the odor in the milk  will be most pronounced. The intensity of such taints is diminished  greatly and often wholly disappears, if the milking is not done for some  hours (8-12) after such foods are consumed.    This same principle applies in lesser degree to many green fodders that  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27785"],[0,"A Book About Lawyers (#9)"],[1,"an impression that, compared with other neighborhoods,  the district north and northeast of Bloomsbury Square still possesses  more than an average number of legal residents; but it no longer remains  the quarter of the lawyers.    There still resides in Mecklenburgh Square a learned Queen's Counsel,  for whose preservation the prayers of the neighborhood constantly  ascend. To his more scholarly and polite neighbors this gentleman is an  object of intellectual interest and anxious affection. As the last of an  extinct species, as a still animate Dodo, as a lordly Mohican who has  outlived his tribe, this isolated counselor of her Gracious Majesty is  watched by heedful eyes whenever he crosses his threshold. In the  morning, as he paces from his dwelling to chambers, his way down Doughty  Street and John Street, and through Gray's Inn Gardens, is guarded by  men anxious for his safety. Shreds of orange-peel are whisked from the  pavement on which he is about to tread; and when he crosses Holborn he  walks between those who would imperil their lives to rescue him from  danger. The gatekeeper in Doughty Street daily makes him low obeisance,  knowing the historic value and interest of his courtly presence.  Occasionally the inhabitants of Mecklenburgh Square whisper a fear that  some sad morning their Q.C. may flit away without giving them a warning.  Long may it be before the residents of the 'Old Law Quarter' shall wail  over the fulfillment of this dismal anticipation!    [2] Dr. Clench lived in Brownlow Street, Holborn; and until his death,  in 1831, John Abernethy occupied in Bedford Row the house which is still  inhabited by an eminent surgeon, who was Abernethy's favorite pupil. Of  Dr. Clench's death in January, 1691-2, Narcissus Luttrell gives the  following account: \"The 5th, last night, Dr. Clench, the physician, was  strangled in a coach; two persons came to his house in Brownlow Street,  Holborn, in a coach, and pretended to carry him to a patient's in the  City; they drove backward and forward, and after some time stopt by  Leadenhall, and sent the coachman to buy a couple of fowls for supper,  who went accordingly; and in the meantime they slipt away, and the  coachman when he returned found Dr. Clench with a handkerchief tyed  about his neck, with a hard sea-coal twisted in it, and clapt against  his windpipe; he had spirits applied to him and other means, but too  late, he having been dead some time.\" Dr. Clench's murderer, one Mr.  Harrison, a man of gentle condition, was apprehended, tried, found  guilty, and hung in chains.    [3] Holt's country seat was Redgrave Hall, formerly the home of the  Bacons. It was on his manor of Redgrave, that Sir Nicholas Bacon  entertained Queen Elizabeth, when she remarked that her Lord Keeper's  house was too small for him, and he answered--\"Your Majesty has made me  too great for my house.\"          PART II.    LOVES OF THE LAWYERS.          CHAPTER VI.    A LOTTERY.      \"I would compare the multitude of women which are to be chosen for wives  unto a bag full of snakes, having among them a single eel; now if a man  should put his hand into this bag, he may chance to light on the eel;  but it is an hundred to one he shall be stung by a snake.\"    These words were often heard from the lips of that honest judge, Sir  John More, whose son Thomas stirred from brain to foot by the bright  eyes, and snowy neck, and flowing locks of _cara Elizabetha_ (the _cara  Elizabetha_ of a more recent Tom More was 'Bessie, my darling')--penned  those warm and sweetly-flowing verses which delight scholars of the  present generation, and of which the following lines are neither the  least musical nor the least characteristic:--       \"Jam subit illa dies quae ludentem obtulit olim       Inter virgineos te mibi prima choros.     Lactea cum flavi decuerunt colla capilli,       Cum gena par nivibus visa, labella rosis:     Cum tua perstringunt oculos duo sydera nostros       Perque oculos intrant in mea corda meos.\"    The goddess of love played the poet more than one droll trick. Having  approached her with musical flattery, he fled from her with fear and  abhorrence. For a time the highest and holiest of human affections was  to his darkened mind no more than a carnal appetite; and he strove to  conquer the emotions which he feared would rouse within him a riot of  impious passions. With fasting and cruel discipline he would fain have  killed the devil that agitated him, whenever he passed a pretty girl in  the street. As a lay Carthusian he wore a hair-shirt next his skin,  disciplined his bare back with scourges, slept on the cold ground or a  hard bench, and by a score other strong measures sought to preserve his  spiritual by ruining his bodily health. But nature was too powerful for  unwholesome doctrine and usage, and before he rashly took a celibatic  vow, he knelt to fair Jane Colt--and rising, kissed her on the lips.    When spiritual counsel had removed his conscientious objections to  matrimony, he could not condescend to marry for love, but must,  forsooth, choose his wife in obedience to considerations of compassion  and mercy. Loving her younger sister, he paid his addresses to Jane,  because he shrunk from the injustice of putting the junior above the  older of the two girls. \"Sir Thomas having determined, by the advice and  direction of his ghostly father, to be a married man, there was at that  time a pleasant conceited gentleman of an ancient family in Essex, one  Mr. John Colt, of New Hall, that invited him into his house, being much  delighted in his company, proffering unto him the choice of any of his  daughters, who were young gentlewomen of very good carriage, good  complexions, and very religiously inclined; whose honest and sweet  conversation and virtuous education enticed Sir Thomas not a little; and  although his affection most served him to the second, for that he  thought her the fairest and best favored, yet when he thought within  himself that it would be a grief and some blemish to the eldest to have  the younger sister preferred before her, he, out of a kind of  compassion, settled his fancy upon the eldest, and soon after married  her with all his friends' good liking.\"    The marriage was a fair happy union, but its duration was short. After  giving birth to four children Jane died, leaving the young husband, who  had instructed her sedulously, to mourn her sincerely. That his sorrow  was poignant may be easily believed; for her death deprived him of a  docile pupil, as well as a dutiful wife.    \"Virginem duxit admodum puellam,\" Erasmus says of his friend, \"claro  genere natam, rudem adhuc utpote ruri inter parentes ac sorores semper  habitam, quo magis illi liceret illam ad suos mores fingere. Hanc et  literis instruendam curavit, et omni musices genere doctam reddidit.\"  Here is another insight into the considerations which brought about the  marriage. When he set out in search of a wife, he wished to capture a  simple, unsophisticated, untaught country girl, whose ignorance of the  world should incline her to rely on his superior knowledge, and the  deficiencies of whose intellectual training should leave him an ample  field for educational experiments. Seeking this he naturally turned his  steps toward the eastern countries; and in Essex he found the young  lady, who to the last learnt with intelligence and zeal the lessons  which he set her.    More's second choice of a wife was less fortunate than his first.  Wanting a woman to take care of his children and preside over his rather  numerous establishment, he made an offer to a widow, named Alice  Middleton. Plain and homely in appearance and taste, Mistress Alice  would have been invaluable to Sir Thomas as a superior domestic servant,  but his good judgment and taste deserted him when he decided to make  her a closer companion. Bustling, keen, loquacious, tart, the good dame  scolded servants and petty tradesmen with admirable effect; but even at  this distance of time the sensitive ear is pained by her sharp,  garrulous tongue, when its acerbity and virulence are turned against her  pacific and scholarly husband. A smile follows the recollection that he  endeavored to soften her manners and elevate her nature by a system of  culture similar to that by which Jane Colt, 'admodum puella,' had been  formed and raised into a polished gentlewoman. Past forty years of age,  Mistress Alice was required to educate herself anew. Erasmus assures his  readers that \"though verging on old age, and not of a yielding temper,\"  she was prevailed upon \"to take lessons on the lute, the cithara, the  viol, the monochord, and the flute, which she daily practised to him.\"    It has been the fashion with biographers to speak bitterly of this poor  woman, and to pity More for his cruel fate in being united to a  termagant. No one has any compassion for her. Sir Thomas is the victim;  Mistress Alice the shrill virago. In those days, when every historic  reprobate finds an apologist, is there no one to say a word in behalf of  the Widow Middleton, whose lot in life and death seems to this writer  very pitiable? She was quick in temper, slow in brain, domineering,  awkward. To rouse sympathy for such a woman is no easy task; but if  wretchedness is a title to compassion, Mistress Alice has a right to  charity and gentle usage. It _was not_ her fault that she could not  sympathize with her grand husband, in his studies and tastes, his lofty  life and voluntary death; it _was_ her misfortune that his steps  traversed plains high above her own moral and intellectual level. By  social theory they were intimate companions; in reality, no man and  woman in all England were wider apart. From his elevation he looked  down on her with commiseration that was heightened by curiosity and  amazement; and she daily writhed under his gracious condescension and  passionless urbanity; under her own consciousness of"]]]
