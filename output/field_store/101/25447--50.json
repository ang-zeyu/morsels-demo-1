Should America's good offices prove to be in  vain it will be not ours but England's fault, and the Americans will  then readily understand that the reproach of an inhuman mode of  warfare must be laid at the doors of England and not Germany.    It will soon be seen whether President Wilson employs the same measure  of energy against the English as against us. We sincerely hope so  because of the friendly, hearty tone of his note. \"The American  Government cannot admit that the proclamation of a war zone may be  made to abbreviate the rights of American citizens?\" Really not? We  recall that at the beginning of the war England declared the whole  North Sea as a war zone and the Americans did not get excited at that  time. We had a right to protest bitterly at America's attitude then,  but we will forget about it at the present moment. America has  proffered her good offices, and we will not doubt that her intentions  are honorable and meant in good faith.    _Paul Michaelis, in the Tageblatt, said:_    It is certain that the note does not simplify the serious situation,  and it is equally certain that it does not completely bar the way to  a peaceful and friendly understanding. The American Government holds  fast to the principle that submarine warfare on merchantmen is  inconsistent with the principles of justice and humanity, but the  German Government has never left the slightest doubt that it only  decided on the submarine warfare because the English method of  scorning all previous rules of naval warfare forced Germany to a  counter-war on commerce with the submarine.    But there seems to be no reason why the German and American  Governments should not get together in a joint discussion looking  toward some other form of naval warfare. This presupposes that  England, which took the first step in the commerce war, also takes the  first step to end it. At the same time the question must be  investigated of how ammunition shipments to our enemies can be  reconciled with the eternal principles of humanity featured by the  American note.    While there may be some practical difficulties, there can be no doubt  of Germany's willingness to help to bring about a modification of the  naval war along more humane lines. The answer to the American note  must, of course, take most carefully into account all the diplomatic,  political, and military exigencies, and it will be several weeks  before it is ready to be handed to the American Ambassador, especially  as we must wait to hear Dr. Meyer-Gerhard.    But it must be said now that the German people, now, as formerly, lay  great value on a continuation of unclouded relations with the United  States, whose war for freedom it once greeted with rejoicing, and  within whose borders millions of Germans have found a new home.    _Count Reventlow, Germany's \"enfant terrible\" who has been a  consistent thorn in the flesh of the German Foreign Office because of  his anti-American utterances, struck a surprisingly restrained and  moderate tone in the Tageszeitung:_    The question is not how it may be possible to do away with all  differences of opinion under all circumstances, but whether it is at  all possible to do away with them without rendering the submarine war  impotent. This standpoint contains nothing unfriendly, nothing brusque  against the United States. The practical question remains whether we  can preserve our German standpoint and still come to an understanding  with America. If Mr. Wilson holds to his non-recognition of the war  zone, with all its corollaries, then we cannot see how we can possibly  come to a real understanding.    On the other hand, the question arises whether President Wilson would  continue to cling to that standpoint if certain modifications and  mutual guarantees could be brought about which under certain  circumstances would render American passenger traffic safe.    _A newspaper war between advocates of a friendly settlement and the  \"no compromise\" representatives soon began to rage. Naval writers in  particular urged that Germany could not afford to yield an iota  regarding the principles and practice of submarine warfare, but the  very violence of their attacks upon the advocates of an understanding  indicates that the latter are not without influence._    _The Cologne Gazette points out editorially that the German press in  general has shown satisfaction that President Wilson's communication  offers opportunity for an understanding, and expresses the belief that  diplomacy on both sides of the Atlantic will work with zeal and  good-will to this end. It adds:_    It is quite certain the German Government, at least, will do this, and  will be generally supported therein by the people. It would be pure  imbecility to seek to drag in without necessity a ninth or tenth enemy  for ourselves, even though its participation in the war should be  limited to supplying the Quadruple Alliance with money and munitions.  We say without necessity; for recognition of the fact that Germany is  acting in self-defense in using the torpedoes of its submarines  against hostile merchantmen so long as England maintains its business  blockade against us should, we believe, be a condition which the  United States should recognize as preliminary to negotiations.    _In a leading article entitled \"Bad Advice\" the Cologne Gazette takes  the Lokalanzeiger to task for attempting to palliate the British  \"starving-out policy\" and exportations from America of war supplies.  Conceding that the cutting off of supplies is an accepted method of  warfare, it states that international law provides expressly that this  weapon may be used only in the form of an effective blockade. It holds  that no effective blockade of the German coasts has been declared,  however, and that Germany therefore is deprived of the possibility of  taking action against blockading ships._    _Regarding the exportation of munitions from the United States, the  Gazette adopts the argument of Philip Zorn, German member of The Hague  Tribunals, that, although the convention adopted at The Hague  justifies sales by private firms, a neutral State is bound to prohibit  sales of this nature when the commerce in arms assumes such magnitude  that continuation of war is directly dependent thereon. He says:_    \"That the German representatives [at The Hague] voted in favor of  permission to deliver arms is incontestable,\" the article continues,  \"but there is a great difference between stamping every sale of arms  by a private firm in a neutral State as a violation of international  law--this was what the German representatives objected to--and arguing  that to supply enormous quantities to one group of belligerents alone,  and to devote practically the entire available industry of a country  thereto, is consonant with the spirit of true neutrality.\"    _Captain von Kuehlwetter, the naval expert of the Tag, points out that  the American note passes over in silence the German representations  regarding the British Admiralty's instructions to merchantmen to seek  cover under neutral flags and to attack submarines under this cover.  He declares this is the kernel of the whole argument and the  justification for the German policy. He adds:_    If a submarine attacks such a ship there is an outcry about barbarians  who violate international law and endanger innocent neutral  passengers, but if a ship attacks a submarine then it is a brave act  of a daring shipper, to whom is given a commission, a gold watch, and  a diploma.          Press Opinion of the Allies      BRITISH COMMENT.    _A.G. Gardiner, editor of The London Daily News, writing in that paper  on June 12, says the rupture between President Wilson and Mr. Bryan is  one of the great landmarks of the war. He goes on:_    Whatever other significance the event may have, it is conclusive  evidence of the failure of German diplomacy in America. The Kaiser has  made many miscalculations about nations and about men, but no greater  miscalculation than that which he has made in regard to President  Wilson and the United States.    He is not alone in that. There has been a good deal of ignorance on  the same subject in this country. In the early stages of the war there  was a mischievous clamor against the United States in a section of the  press, which has never quite got rid of the idea that America is only  a rather rebellious member of our own household, to be patronized when  it does what we want and lectured like a disobedient child when it  does not.    President Wilson has assumed in these ill-informed quarters to be a  timid academic person, so different from that magnificent tub thumper,  Roosevelt, who would have been at war with Mexico in a trice, and  would, it was believed, have plunged into the European struggle with  or without an excuse.    If there was misunderstanding here on this subject, we cannot be  surprised that the Kaiser blundered so badly. He, too, believed in the  schoolmaster view of Woodrow Wilson. A man who had refused such a  golden opportunity of annexing Mexico must be a timid, invertebrate  person, who had only to be bullied in order to do what he was told.  Moreover, was there not a great German population to serve as a whip  for the Presidential blank and see that he did not send the polite,  the gracious, the supple Prince von Buelow to Washington?    That courtly gentleman was dispatched to Italy to charm the Italian  Nation into quiescence. For the Americans he needed another style of  diplomacy, and he sent thither the stout and rather stupid Dernburg to  let President Wilson and the Americans know that Germany was a very  rough customer and would stand no nonsense from anybody.    It was a fatal blunder, the blunder of a people who had been so  blinded by materialism that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],[0,"The Care of Books (#9)"],[1,"world.    [Illustration: Fig. 9. A reader with a roll: from a fresco at Pompeii.]    These sticks were sometimes painted or gilt, and furnished with projecting  knobs (_cornua_) similarly decorated, intended to serve both as an  ornament, and as a contrivance to keep the ends of the roll even, while it  was being rolled up. The sides of the long dimension of the roll  (_frontes_) were carefully cut, so as to be perfectly symmetrical, and  afterwards smoothed with pumice-stone and coloured. A ticket (_index_ or  _titulus_, in Greek [Greek: sillubos] or [Greek: sittubos]), made of a  piece of papyrus or parchment, was fastened to the edge of the roll in  such a way that it hung out over one or other of the ends. As Ovid says:      Cetera turba palam titulos ostendet apertos      Et sua detecta nomina fronte geret[64].        The others will flaunt their titles openly, and carry      their names on an uncovered edge.    The roll was kept closed by strings or straps (_lora_), usually of some  bright colour[65]; and if it was specially precious, an envelope which the  Greeks called a jacket ([Greek: diphthera][66]), made of parchment or some  other substance, was provided. Says Martial:      Perfer Atestinae nondum vulgata Sabinae      Carmina, purpurea sed modo culta toga[67].        Convey to Sabina at Ateste these verses. They have not      yet been published, and have been but lately dressed in      a purple garment.    Martial has combined in a single epigram most of the ornaments with which  rolls could be decorated. This I will quote next, premising that the oil  of cedar, or _arbor-vitae_, mentioned in the second line not only imparted  an agreeable yellow colour, but was held to be an antiseptic[68].      Faustini fugis in sinum? sapisti.    Cedro nunc licet ambules perunctus    Et frontis gemino decens honore    Pictis luxurieris umbilicis,    Et te purpura delicata velet,    Et cocco rubeat superbus index[69].    His book had selected the bibliomaniac Faustinus as a patron. Now, says  the poet, you shall be anointed with oil of cedar; you shall revel in the  decoration of both your sets of edges; your sticks shall be painted; your  covering shall be purple, and your ticket scarlet.    When a number of rolls had to be carried from one place to another, they  were put into a box (_scrinium_ or _capsa_). This receptacle was  cylindrical in shape, not unlike a modern hat-box[70]. It was carried by a  flexible handle, attached to a ring on each side; and the lid was held  down by what looks very like a modern lock. The eighteen rolls, found in a  bundle at Herculaneum, had doubtless been kept in a similar receptacle.    My illustration (fig. 10) is from a fresco at Herculaneum. It will be  noticed that each roll is furnished with a ticket (_titulus_). At the feet  of the statue of Demosthenes already referred to, and of that of  Sophocles, are _capsae_, both of which show the flexible handles.    [Illustration: Fig. 10. Book-box or capsa.]    I will next collect the information available respecting the fittings used  in Roman libraries. I admit that it is scattered and imperfect; but  legitimate deductions may, I think, be arrived at from it, which will give  us tolerably certain ideas of the appearance of one of those collections.    The words used to designate such fittings are: _nidus_; _forulus_, or more  usually _foruli_; _loculamenta_; _pluteus_; _pegmata_.    _Nidus_ needs no explanation. It can only mean a pigeon-hole. Martial uses  it of a bookseller, at whose shop his own poems may be bought.      De primo dabit alterove _nido_    Rasum pumice purpuraque cultum    Denaris tibi quinque Martialem[71].        Out of his first or second pigeon-hole, polished with      pumice stone, and smart with a purple covering, for five      denarii he will give you Martial.    In a subsequent epigram the word occurs with reference to a private  library, to which the poet is sending a copy of his works.      Ruris bibliotheca delicati,    Vicinam videt unde lector urbem,    Inter carmina sanctiora si quis    Lascivae fuerit locus Thaliae,    Hos _nido_ licet inseras vel imo    Septem quos tibi misimus libellos[72].        O library of that well-appointed villa whence a reader      can see the City near at hand--if among more serious      poems there be any room for the wanton Muse of Comedy,      you may place these seven little books I send you even      in your lowest pigeon-hole.    _Forulus_ or _foruli_ occurs in the following passages. Suetonius, after  describing the building of the temple of the Palatine Apollo by Augustus,  adds, \"he placed the Sibylline books in two gilt receptacles (_forulis_)  under the base of the statue of Palatine Apollo\"[73]; and Juvenal,  enumerating the gifts that a rich man is sure to receive if burnt out of  house and home, says,      Hic libros dabit, et _forulos_, mediamque Minervam[74].    The word is of uncertain derivation, but _forus_, of which it is clearly  the diminutive, is used by Virgil for the cells of bees:      Complebuntque _foros_ et floribus horrea texent[75].    The above-quoted passage of Juvenal may therefore be rendered: \"Another  will give books, and cells to put them in, and a statue of Minerva for the  middle of the room.\"    The word _loculamentum_ is explained in a passage of Columella, in which  he gives directions for the making of dovecotes:        Let small stakes be placed close together, with planks      laid across them to carry cells (_loculamenta_) for the      birds to build their nests in, or sets of pigeon-holes      made of earthenware[76].    In a second passage he uses the same word for a beehive[77]; Vegetius, a  writer on veterinary surgery, uses it for the socket of a horse's  tooth[78]; and Vitruvius, in a more general way, for a case to contain a  small piece of machinery[79]. Generally, the word may be taken to signify  a long narrow box, open at one end, and, like _nidus_ and _forulus_, may  be translated \"pigeon-hole.\" Seneca, again, applies the word to books in  the passage I have already translated, and in a singularly instructive  manner. \"You will find,\" he says, \"in the libraries of the most arrant  idlers all that orators or historians have written--bookcases  (_loculamenta_) built up as high as the ceiling[80].\"    _Pegmata_, for the word generally occurs in the plural, are, as the name  implies, things fixed together, usually planks of wood framed into a  platform, and used in theatres to carry pieces of scenery or performers up  and down. As applied to books \"shelves\" are probably meant: an  interpretation borne out by the _Digest_, in which it is stated that  \"window-frames and _pegmata_ are included in the purchase of a house[81].\"  They were therefore what we should call \"fixtures.\"    A _pluteus_ was a machine used by infantry for protection in the field:  and hence the word is applied to any fence, or boarding to form the limit  or edge of anything, as a table or a bed. _Plutei_ were not attached so  closely to the walls as _pegmata_, for in the _Digest_ they are classed  with nets to keep out birds, mats, awnings, and the like, and are not to  be regarded as part and parcel of a house[82]. Juvenal uses the word for  a shelf in his second Satire, where he is denouncing pretenders to  knowledge:        Indocti primum, quamquam plena omnia gypso    Chrysippi invenias, nam perfectissimus horum est    Si quis Aristotelem similem vel Pittacon emit    Et iubet archetypos pluteum servare Cleanthas[83].        In the first place they are dunces, though you find      their houses full of plaster figures of Chrysippus: for      a man of this sort is not fully equipped until he buys a      likeness of Aristotle or Pittacus, and bids a shelf take      care of original portraits of Cleanthes.    This investigation has shewn that three of the words applied to the  preservation of books, namely, _nidus_, _forulus_, and _loculamentum_, may  be rendered by the English \"pigeon-hole\"; and that _pegma_ and _pluteus_  mean contrivances of wood which may be rendered by the English \"shelving.\"  It is quite clear that _pegmata_ could be run up with great rapidity, from  a very graphic account in Cicero's letters of the rearrangement of his  library. He begins by writing to his friend Atticus as follows:        I wish you would send me any two fellows out of your      library, for Tyrannio to make use of as pasters, and      assistants in other matters. Remind them to bring some      vellum with them to make those titles (_indices_) which      you Greeks, I believe, call [Greek: silluboi]. You are      not to do this if it is inconvenient to you[84]....    In the next letter he says:        Your men have made my library gay with their      carpentry-work and their titles (_constructione et      sillybis_). I wish you would commend them[85].    When all is completed he writes:        Now that Tyrannio has arranged my books, a new spirit      has been infused into my house. In this matter the help      of your men Dionysius and Menophilus has been      invaluable. Nothing could look neater than those shelves      of yours (_illa tua pegmata_), since they smartened up      my books with their titles[86].    No other words than those I have been discussing are, so far as I know,  applied by the best writers to the storage of books; and, after a careful  study of the passages in which they occur, I conclude that, so long as  rolls only had to be accommodated, private libraries in Rome were fitted  with rows of shelves standing against the walls (_plutei_), or fixed to  them (_pegmata_). The space between these horizontal shelves was  subdivided by vertical divisions into pigeon-holes (_nidi_, _foruli_,  _loculamenta_), and it may be conjectured that the width of these  pigeon-holes would vary in accordance with the number of rolls included in  a single work. That such receptacles were the common furniture of a  library is proved, I think, by"]]]
