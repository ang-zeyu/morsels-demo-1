We have also means to convey sounds in trunks and pipes, in  strange lines and distances.    \"We have also perfume-houses; wherewith we join also practices of  taste.  We multiply smells, which may seem strange.  We imitate smells,  making all smells to breathe outs of other mixtures than those that  give them.  We make divers imitations of taste likewise, so that they  will deceive any man's taste.  And in this house we contain also a  confiture-house; where we make all sweet-meats, dry and moist; and  divers pleasant wines, milks, broths, and sallets; in far greater  variety than you have.    \"We have also engine-houses, where are prepared engines and instruments  for all sorts of motions.  There we imitate and practise to make  swifter motions than any you have, either out of your muskets or any  engine that you have: and to make them and multiply them more easily,  and with small force, by wheels and other means: and to make them  stronger and more violent than yours are; exceeding your greatest  cannons and basilisks.  We represent also ordnance and instruments of  war, and engines of all kinds: and likewise new mixtures and  compositions of gun-powder, wild-fires burning in water, and  unquenchable.  Also fireworks of all variety both for pleasure and use.  We imitate also flights of birds; we have some degrees of flying in the  air.  We have ships and boats for going under water, and brooking of  seas; also swimming-girdles and supporters.  We have divers curious  clocks, and other like motions of return: and some perpetual motions.  We imitate also motions of living creatures, by images, of men, beasts,  birds, fishes, and serpents.  We have also a great number of other  various motions, strange for equality, fineness, and subtilty.    \"We have also a mathematical house, where are represented all  instruments, as well of geometry as astronomy, exquisitely made.    \"We have also houses of deceits of the senses; where we represent all  manner of feats of juggling, false apparitions, impostures, and  illusions; and their fallacies.  And surely you will easily believe  that we that have so many things truly natural which induce admiration,  could in a world of particulars deceive the senses, if we would  disguise those things and labour to make them seem more miraculous. But  we do hate all impostures, and lies; insomuch as we have severely  forbidden it to all our fellows, under pain of ignominy and fines, that  they do not show any natural work or thing, adorned or swelling; but  only pure as it is, and without all affectation of strangeness.    \"These are (my son) the riches of Salomon's House.    \"For the several employments and offices of our fellows; we have twelve  that sail into foreign countries, under the names of other nations,  (for our own we conceal); who bring us the books, and abstracts, and  patterns of experiments of all other parts.  These we call Merchants of  Light.    \"We have three that collect the experiments which are in all books.  These we call Depredators.    \"We have three that collect the experiments of all mechanical arts; and  also of liberal sciences; and also of practices which are not brought  into arts.  These we call Mystery-men.    \"We have three that try new experiments, such as themselves think good.  These we call Pioneers or Miners.    \"We have three that draw the experiments of the former four into titles  and tables, to give the better light for the drawing of observations  and axioms out of them.  These we call Compilers.    \"We have three that bend themselves, looking into the experiments of  their fellows, and cast about how to draw out of them things of use and  practise for man's life, and knowledge, as well for works as for plain  demonstration of causes, means of natural divinations, and the easy and  clear discovery of the virtues and parts of bodies.  These we call  Dowry-men or Benefactors.    \"Then after divers meetings and consults of our whole number, to  consider of the former labours and collections, we have three that take  care, out of them, to direct new experiments, of a higher light, more  penetrating into nature than the former.  These we call Lamps.    \"We have three others that do execute the experiments so directed, and  report them.  These we call Inoculators.    \"Lastly, we have three that raise the former discoveries by experiments  into greater observations, axioms, and aphorisms.  These we call  Interpreters of Nature.    \"We have also, as you must think, novices and apprentices, that the  succession of the former employed men do not fail; besides, a great  number of servants and attendants, men and women.  And this we do also:  we have consultations, which of the inventions and experiences which we  have discovered shall be published, and which not: and take all an oath  of secrecy, for the concealing of those which we think fit to keep  secret: though some of those we do reveal sometimes to the state and  some not.    \"For our ordinances and rites: we have two very long and fair  galleries: in one of these we place patterns and samples of all manner  of the more rare and excellent inventions in the other we place the  statues of all principal inventors.  There we have the statue of your  Columbus, that discovered the West Indies: also the inventor of ships:  your monk that was the inventor of ordnance and of gunpowder: the  inventor of music: the inventor of letters: the inventor of printing:  the inventor of observations of astronomy: the inventor of works in  metal: the inventor of glass: the inventor of silk of the worm: the  inventor of wine: the inventor of corn and bread: the inventor of  sugars: and all these, by more certain tradition than you have.  Then  have we divers inventors of our own, of excellent works; which since  you have not seen, it were too long to make descriptions of them; and  besides, in the right understanding of those descriptions you might  easily err.  For upon every invention of value, we erect a statue to  the inventor, and give him a liberal and honourable reward.  These  statues are some of brass; some of marble and touch-stone; some of  cedar and other special woods gilt and adorned; some of iron; some of  silver; some of gold.    \"We have certain hymns and services, which we say daily, of Lord and  thanks to God for his marvellous works: and forms of prayers, imploring  his aid and blessing for the illumination of our labours, and the  turning of them into good and holy uses.    \"Lastly, we have circuits or visits of divers principal cities of the  kingdom; where, as it cometh to pass, we do publish such new profitable  inventions as we think good.  And we do also declare natural  divinations of diseases, plagues, swarms-of hurtful creatures,  scarcity, tempests, earthquakes, great inundations, comets, temperature  of the year, and divers other things; and we give counsel thereupon,  what the people shall do for the prevention and remedy of them.\"    And when he had said this, he stood up; and I, as I had been taught,  kneeled down, and he laid his right hand upon my head, and said; \"God  bless thee, my son; and God bless this relation, which I have made.  I  give thee leave to publish it for the good of other nations; for we  here are in God's bosom, a land unknown.\"  And so he left me; having  assigned a value of about two thousand ducats, for a bounty to me and  my fellows.  For they give great largesses where they come upon all  occasions.
