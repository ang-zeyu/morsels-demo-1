It is hard to describe the feelings aroused by the arrival of a ship  in port after a long voyage. From the outmost end of the longest  wharf the relatives and friends of the sailors eagerly watch the  approaching vessel, striving to find in her appearance some token of  the safety of the loved ones on board. If a flag hangs at half-mast in  the rigging, bitter is the suspense, and fearful the dread, of each  anxious waiter, lest her husband or lover or son be the unfortunate  one whose death is mourned. And on the deck of the ship the excitement  is no less great. Even the hardened breast of the sailor swells with  emotion when he first catches sight of his native town, after long  months of absence. With eyes sharpened by constant searching for  objects upon the broad bosom of the ocean, he scans the waiting crowd,  striving to distinguish in the distance some well-beloved face. His  spirits are light with the happy anticipation of a season in port with  his loved ones, and he discharges his last duties before leaving the  ship with a blithe heart.    So it was with the crew of the home-coming brig. Right merrily they  sung out their choruses as they pulled at the ropes, and brought the  vessel to anchor. The rumble of the hawser through the hawseholes was  sweet music to their ears; and so intent were they upon the crowd on  the dock, that they did not notice two long-boats which had put off  from the man-of-war, and were pulling for the brig. The captain of the  merchantman, however, noticed the approach of the boats, and wondered  what it meant. \"Those fellows think I've smuggled goods aboard,\" said  he. \"However, they can spend their time searching if they want. I've  nothing in the hold I'm afraid to have seen.\"    The boats were soon alongside; and two or three officers, with a  handful of jackies, clambered aboard the brig.    \"Muster your men aft, captain,\" said the leader, scorning any response  to the captain's salutation. \"The king has need of a few fine fellows  for his service.\"    \"Surely, sir, you are not about to press any of these men,\" protested  the captain. \"They are just returning after a long voyage, and have  not yet seen their families.\"    \"What's that to me, sir?\" was the response. \"Muster your crew without  more words.\"    Sullenly the men came aft, and ranged themselves in line before the  boarding-officers. Each feared lest he might be one of those chosen to  fill the ship's roll of the \"Maidstone;\" yet each cherished the hope  that he might be spared to go ashore, and see the loved ones whose  greeting he had so fondly anticipated.    The boarding-officers looked the crew over, and, after consulting  together, gruffly ordered the men to go below, and pack up their  traps.    \"Surely you don't propose to take my entire crew?\" said the captain of  the brig in wondering indignation.    \"I know my business, sir,\" was the gruff reply, \"and I do not propose  to suffer any more interference.\"    The crew of the brig soon came on deck, carrying their bags of  clothes, and were ordered into the man-o'-war's boats, which speedily  conveyed them to their floating prison. Their fond visions of home had  been rudely dispelled. They were now enrolled in his Majesty's  service, and subject to the will of a blue-coated tyrant. This was all  their welcome home.    When the news of this cruel outrage reached the shore, the indignation  of the people knew no bounds. The thought of their fellow-townsmen  thus cruelly deprived of their liberty, at the conclusion of a long  and perilous voyage, set the whole village in a turmoil. Wild plots  were concocted for the destruction of the man-of-war, that, sullen and  unyielding, lay at her anchorage in the harbor. But the wrong done was  beyond redress. The captured men were not to be liberated. There was  no ordnance in the little town to compete with the guns of the  \"Maidstone,\" and the enraged citizens could only vent their anger by  impotent threats and curses. Bands of angry men and boys paraded the  streets, crying, \"Down with the press-gang,\" and invoking the  vengeance of Heaven upon the officers of the man-of-war. Finally, they  found a boat belonging to the \"Maidstone\" lying at a wharf. Dragging  this ashore, the crowd procured ropes, and, after pulling the captured  trophy up and down the streets, took it to the common in front of the  Court-House, where it was burned in the presence of a great crowd,  which heaped execrations upon the heads of the officers of the  \"Maidstone,\" and King George's press-gang.    After this occurrence, there was a long truce between the people of  Newport and the officers of the British navy. But the little town was  intolerant of oppression, and the revolutionary spirit broke out again  in 1769. Historians have eulogized Boston as the cradle of liberty,  and by the British pamphleteers of that era the Massachusetts city  was often called a hot-bed of rebellion. It would appear, however,  that, while the people of Boston were resting contentedly under the  king's rule, the citizens of Newport were chafing under the yoke, and  were quick to resist any attempts at tyranny.    It is noticeable, that, in each outbreak of the people of Newport  against the authority of the king's vessels, the vigor of the  resistance increased, and their acts of retaliation became bolder.  Thus in the affair of the \"St. John\" the king's vessel was fired on,  while in the affair of the \"Maidstone\" the royal property was actually  destroyed. In the later affairs with the sloop \"Liberty\" and the  schooner \"Gaspee,\" the revolt of the colonists was still more open,  and the consequences more serious.    In 1769 the armed sloop \"Liberty,\" Capt. Reid, was stationed in  Narragansett Bay for the purpose of enforcing the revenue laws. Her  errand made her obnoxious to the people on the coast, and the  extraordinary zeal of her captain in discharging his duty made her  doubly detested by seafaring people afloat or shore.    On the 17th of July the \"Liberty,\" while cruising near the mouth of  the bay, sighted a sloop and a brig under full sail, bound out.  Promptly giving chase, the armed vessel soon overtook the merchantmen  sufficiently to send a shot skipping along the crests of the waves, as  a polite Invitation to stop. The two vessels hove to, and a boat was  sent from the man-of-war to examine their papers, and see if all was  right. Though no flaw was found in the papers of either vessel, Capt.  Reid determined to take them back to Newport, which was done. In the  harbor the two vessels were brought to anchor under the guns of the  armed sloop, and without any reason or explanation were kept there  several days. After submitting to this wanton detention for two days,  Capt. Packwood of the brig went on board the \"Liberty\" to make a  protest to Capt. Reid, and at the same time to get some wearing  apparel taken from his cabin at the time his vessel had been captured.  On reaching the deck of the armed vessel, he found Capt. Reid absent,  and his request for his property was received with ridicule. Hot words  soon led to violence; and as Capt. Packwood stepped in to his boat to  return to his ship, he was fired at several times, none of the shots  taking effect.    [Illustration: Siege of Charleston, S.C., May, 1780.  Copyright, 1874, by Johnson, Wilson & Co.]    The news of this assault spread like wildfire in the little town. The  people congregated on the streets, demanding reparation. The  authorities sent a message to Capt. Reid, demanding that the man who  fired the shots be given up. Soon a boat came from the \"Liberty,\"  bringing a man who was handed over to the authorities as the culprit.  A brief examination into the case showed that the man was not the  guilty party, and that his surrender was a mere subterfuge. The people  then determined to be trifled with no longer, and made preparations to  take vengeance upon the insolent oppressors.    The work of preparation went on quietly; and by nightfall a large  number of men had agreed to assemble at a given signal, and march upon  the enemy. Neither the authorities of the town nor the officers on the  threatened vessel were given any intimation of the impending outbreak.  Yet the knots of men who stood talking earnestly on the street  corners, or looked significantly at the trim navy vessel lying in the  harbor, might have well given cause for suspicion.    That night, just as the dusk was deepening into dark, a crowd of men  marched down the street to a spot where a number of boats lay hidden  in the shadow of a wharf. Embarking in these silently, they bent to  the oars at the whispered word of command; and the boats were soon  gliding swiftly over the smooth, dark surface of the harbor, toward  the sloop-of-war. As they drew near, the cry of the lookout rang  out,--    \"Boat ahoy!\"    No answer. The boats, crowded with armed men, still advanced.    \"Boat ahoy! Answer, or I'll fire.\"    And, receiving no response, the lookout gave the alarm, and the watch  came tumbling up, just in time to be driven below or disarmed by the  crowd of armed men that swarmed over the gunwale of the vessel. There  was no bloodshed. The crew of the \"Liberty\" was fairly surprised, and  made no resistance. The victorious citizens cut the sloop's cables,  and allowed her to float on shore near Long Wharf. Then, feeling sure  that their prey could not escape them, they cut away her masts,  liberated their captives, and taking the sloop's boats, dragged them  through the streets to the common, where they were burned on a  triumphal bonfire, amid the cheers of the populace.    But the exploit was not to end here. With the high tide the next day,  the hulk of the sloop floated away, and drifted ashore again on Goat  Island. When night fell, some adventurous spirits stealthily went  over,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2232"],[0,"The Duchess of Malfi (#9)"],[1,"it too much.    Both his virtue and form deserv'd a far better fortune:    His discourse rather delighted to judge itself than show itself:    His breast was fill'd with all perfection,    And yet it seemed a private whisp'ring-room,    It made so little noise of 't.      DUCHESS.  But he was basely descended.      BOSOLA.  Will you make yourself a mercenary herald,    Rather to examine men's pedigrees than virtues?    You shall want[89] him:    For know an honest statesman to a prince    Is like a cedar planted by a spring;    The spring bathes the tree's root, the grateful tree    Rewards it with his shadow:  you have not done so.    I would sooner swim to the Bermoothes on    Two politicians' rotten bladders, tied    Together with an intelligencer's heart-string,    Than depend on so changeable a prince's favour.    Fare thee well, Antonio!  Since the malice of the world    Would needs down with thee, it cannot be said yet    That any ill happen'd unto thee, considering thy fall    Was accompanied with virtue.      DUCHESS.  O, you render me excellent music!      BOSOLA.                                      Say you?      DUCHESS.  This good one that you speak of is my husband.      BOSOLA.  Do I not dream?  Can this ambitious age    Have so much goodness in 't as to prefer    A man merely for worth, without these shadows    Of wealth and painted honours?  Possible?      DUCHESS.  I have had three children by him.      BOSOLA.                                      Fortunate lady!    For you have made your private nuptial bed    The humble and fair seminary of peace,    No question but:  many an unbenefic'd scholar    Shall pray for you for this deed, and rejoice    That some preferment in the world can yet    Arise from merit.  The virgins of your land    That have no dowries shall hope your example    Will raise them to rich husbands.  Should you want    Soldiers, 'twould make the very Turks and Moors    Turn Christians, and serve you for this act.    Last, the neglected poets of your time,    In honour of this trophy of a man,    Rais'd by that curious engine, your white hand,    Shall thank you, in your grave, for 't; and make that    More reverend than all the cabinets    Of living princes.  For Antonio,    His fame shall likewise flow from many a pen,    When heralds shall want coats to sell to men.      DUCHESS.  As I taste comfort in this friendly speech,    So would I find concealment.      BOSOLA.  O, the secret of my prince,    Which I will wear on th' inside of my heart!      DUCHESS.  You shall take charge of all my coin and jewels,    And follow him; for he retires himself    To Ancona.      BOSOLA.     So.      DUCHESS.         Whither, within few days,    I mean to follow thee.      BOSOLA.                 Let me think:    I would wish your grace to feign a pilgrimage    To our Lady of Loretto, scarce seven leagues    ]From fair Ancona; so may you depart    Your country with more honour, and your flight    Will seem a princely progress, retaining    Your usual train about you.      DUCHESS.                     Sir, your direction    Shall lead me by the hand.      CARIOLA.                    In my opinion,    She were better progress to the baths at Lucca,    Or go visit the Spa    In Germany; for, if you will believe me,    I do not like this jesting with religion,    This feigned pilgrimage.      DUCHESS.  Thou art a superstitious fool:    Prepare us instantly for our departure.    Past sorrows, let us moderately lament them,    For those to come, seek wisely to prevent them.         [Exeunt DUCHESS and CARIOLA.]      BOSOLA.  A politician is the devil's quilted anvil;    He fashions all sins on him, and the blows    Are never heard:  he may work in a lady's chamber,    As here for proof.  What rests[90] but I reveal    All to my lord?  O, this base quality[91]    Of intelligencer!  Why, every quality i' the world    Prefers but gain or commendation:    Now, for this act I am certain to be rais'd,    And men that paint weeds to the life are prais'd.

MALATESTI.                              The emperor,    Hearing your worth that way, ere you attain'd    This reverend garment, joins you in commission    With the right fortunate soldier the Marquis of Pescara,    And the famous Lannoy.      CARDINAL.               He that had the honour    Of taking the French king prisoner?      MALATESTI.                           The same.    Here 's a plot drawn for a new fortification    At Naples.      FERDINAND.  This great Count Malatesti, I perceive,    Hath got employment?      DELIO.                No employment, my lord;    A marginal note in the muster-book, that he is    A voluntary lord.      FERDINAND.         He 's no soldier.      DELIO.  He has worn gun-powder in 's hollow tooth for the tooth-ache.      SILVIO.  He comes to the leaguer with a full intent    To eat fresh beef and garlic, means to stay    Till the scent be gone, and straight return to court.      DELIO.  He hath read all the late service    As the City-Chronicle relates it;    And keeps two pewterers going, only to express    Battles in model.      SILVIO.            Then he 'll fight by the book.      DELIO.  By the almanac, I think,    To choose good days and shun the critical;    That 's his mistress' scarf.      SILVIO.                       Yes, he protests    He would do much for that taffeta.      DELIO.  I think he would run away from a battle,    To save it from taking prisoner.      SILVIO.                           He is horribly afraid    Gun-powder will spoil the perfume on 't.      DELIO.  I saw a Dutchman break his pate once    For calling him pot-gun; he made his head    Have a bore in 't like a musket.      SILVIO.  I would he had made a touch-hole to 't.    He is indeed a guarded sumpter-cloth,[93]    Only for the remove of the court.           [Enter BOSOLA]      PESCARA.  Bosola arriv'd!  What should be the business?    Some falling-out amongst the cardinals.    These factions amongst great men, they are like    Foxes, when their heads are divided,    They carry fire in their tails, and all the country    About them goes to wrack for 't.      SILVIO.                           What 's that Bosola?      DELIO.  I knew him in Padua,--a fantastical scholar, like such who    study to know how many knots was in Hercules' club, of what colour    Achilles' beard was, or whether Hector were not troubled with the    tooth-ache.  He hath studied himself half blear-eyed to know the true    symmetry of Caesar's nose by a shoeing-horn; and this he did to gain    the name of a speculative man.      PESCARA.  Mark Prince Ferdinand:    A very salamander lives in 's eye,    To mock the eager violence of fire.      SILVIO.  That cardinal hath made more bad faces with his oppression    than ever Michael Angelo made good ones.  He lifts up 's nose, like    a foul porpoise before a storm.      PESCARA.  The Lord Ferdinand laughs.      DELIO.                                Like a deadly cannon    That lightens ere it smokes.      PESCARA.  These are your true pangs of death,    The pangs of life, that struggle with great statesmen.      DELIO.  In such a deformed silence witches whisper their charms.      CARDINAL.  Doth she make religion her riding-hood    To keep her from the sun and tempest?      FERDINAND.  That, that damns her.  Methinks her fault and beauty,    Blended together, show like leprosy,    The whiter, the fouler.  I make it a question    Whether her beggarly brats were ever christ'ned.      CARDINAL.  I will instantly solicit the state of Ancona    To have them banish'd.      FERDINAND.              You are for Loretto:    I shall not be at your ceremony; fare you well.--    Write to the Duke of Malfi, my young nephew    She had by her first husband, and acquaint him    With 's mother's honesty.      BOSOLA.                    I will.      FERDINAND.                          Antonio!    A slave that only smell'd of ink and counters,    And never in 's life look'd like a gentleman,    But in the audit-time.--Go, go presently,    Draw me out an hundred and fifty of our horse,    And meet me at the foot-bridge.         Exeunt.             Scene IV           [Enter] Two Pilgrims to the Shrine of our Lady of Loretto      FIRST PILGRIM.  I have not seen a goodlier shrine than this;    Yet I have visited many.
