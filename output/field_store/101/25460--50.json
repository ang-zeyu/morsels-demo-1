And, again, his life  may become tragic in the struggle with our powerful institutions and  traditions, the leaden weight of which will, apparently, not let him  soar through space to ever greater heights. Apparently, because it  sometimes occurs that an individual rises above the average, and waves  his colors over the heads of the common herd. His life is that of the  storm bird, anxiously making for distant shores. The efforts of the  deepest, truest and freest spirits of our day tend toward the conscious  formation of life, toward that life which will make the blind raging of  the elements impossible; a life which will show man his sovereignity and  admit his right to direct his own world.    The old conception of the drama paid little or no attention to the  importance of the influences of social conditions. It was the individual  alone who had to carry the weight of all responsibility. But is not the  tragedy greater, the suffering of the individual increased, by  influences he cannot control, the existing social and moral conditions?  And is it not true that the very best and most beautiful in the human  breast cannot and will not bow down to the commands of the commonplace  and everyday conditions? Out of the anachronisms of society and its  relation to the individual grow the strongest motives of the modern  drama. Pure personal conflicts are no longer considered important enough  to bring about a dramatic climax. A play must contain the beating of the  waves, the deep breath of life; and its strong invigorating breeze can  never fail in bringing about a dramatic effect upon our emotions. The  new drama means reproduction of nature in all its phases, the social and  psychological included. It embraces, analyzes and enriches all life. It  goes hand in hand with the longing for materially and mentally  harmonious institutions. It rehabilitates the human body, establishes it  in its proper place and dignity, and brings about the long deferred  reconciliation between the mind and the body.    Full of enthusiasm, with the pulse of time throbbing in his veins, the  modern dramatist compiles mountains of material for the better  understanding of Man, and the influences that mould and form him. He no  longer presents capital acts, extraordinary events, or melodramatic  expressions. It is life in all its complexity, that is being unfolded  before us, and so we come closer to the source of the forces that  destroy and build up again, the forces that make for individual  character and direct the world at large. Life, as a whole, is being  dealt with, and not mere particles. Formerly our eyes were dazzled by a  display of costumes and scenery, while the heart remained unmoved. This  no longer satisfies. One must feel the warmth of life, in order to  respond, to be gripped.    The sphere of the drama has widened most marvellously in all directions,  and only ends where human limitations begin. Together with this, a  marked deepening of the inner world has taken place. Still there are  those who have much to say about the vulgarity contained in the modern  drama, and how its inaugurators and following present the ugly and  untruthful. Untrue and ugly, indeed, for those who are buried under a  mass of inherited views and prejudices. The growth of the scope of the  drama has increased the number of the participants therein. Formerly it  was assumed that the fate of the ordinary man, the man of the masses,  was altogether too obscure, too indifferent to serve as material for  anything tragic; since those who had never dwelt in the heights of  material splendor could not go down to the darkest and lowest abyss.  Because of that assumption, the low and humble never gained access to  the center of the stage; they were only utilized to represent mobs.  Those that were of importance were persons of high position and  standing, persons who represented wealth and power with superiority and  dignity, yet with shallow and superficial airs. The ensemble was but a  mechanism and not an organism; and each participant was stiff and  lifeless; each movement was forced and strained. The old fate and hero  drama did not spring from within Man and the things about him; it was  merely manufactured. Most remarkable incidents, unheard of situations  had to be invented, if only to produce, externally, an appearance of  coinciding cause and effect; and not a single plot could be without  secret doors and vaults, terrible oaths and perjury. If Ibsen, Gorky,  Hauptmann, Gabrielle D'Annunzio and others had brought us nothing else  but liberation from such grotesque ballast, from such impossibilities as  destroy every illusion as to the life import of a play, they would still  be entitled to our gratitude and the gratitude of posterity. But they  have done more. Out of the confusion of trap doors, secret passages,  folding screens, they have led us into the light of day, of undisguised  events, with their simple distinct outlines. In this light, the man of  the heap gains in life force, importance and depth. The stage no longer  offers a place for impossible deeds and the endless monologues of the  hero, the important feature is harmonious concert of action. The hero,  on a stage that conscientiously stands for real art and aims to produce  life, is about as superfluous as the clown who amused the audience  between the acts. After all the spectacle of one star display, one  cannot help but hail the refreshing contrast, shown in the \"Man of  Destiny,\" by the clever Bernard Shaw, where he presents the legend-hero,  Napoleon, as a petty intriguer, with all the inner fear and uneasiness  of a plotter. In these days of concerted energy, of the co-operation of  numerous hands and brains; in the days when the most far-reaching effect  can only be accomplished through the summons of a manifold physical and  mental endeavor, the existence of these loud heroes is circumscribed  within rather limited lines.    Previous generations could never have grasped the deep tragedy in that  famous painting of Millet that inspired Edwin Markham to write his \"Man  with the Hoe.\" Our generation, however, is thrilled by it. And is there  not something terribly tragic about the lives of the great masses who  pierced the colossal stone cliffs of the Simplon, or who are building  the Panama Canal? They have and are performing a task that may safely be  compared with the extraordinary achievements of Hercules; works which,  according to human conception, will last into eternity. The names and  the characters of these workmen are unknown. The historians, coldly and  disinterestedly, pass them by.    The new drama has unveiled this kind of tragedy. It has done away with  the lie that sought to produce a violent dramatic effect through a  plunge from the sublime to the ridiculous. Those who understand  Tolstoy's \"Power of Darkness,\" wherein but those of the lowest strata  appear, will be overwhelmed by the terrible tragedy in their lives, in  comparison with which the worries of some crowned head or the money  troubles of some powerful speculator will appear insignificant indeed.  That which this master unfolds before us is no longer a plunge from  heaven to hell; the entire life of these people is an Inferno. The  terrible darkness and ignorance of these people, forced on them by the  social misery of dull necessity, produces greater soul sensations in the  spectator than the stilted tragedy of a Corneille. Those who witness a  performance of Gerhart Hauptmann's \"Hannele\" and fail to be stirred by  the grandeur and depth of that masterpiece, regardless of its petty  poorhouse atmosphere, deserve to see nothing else than the \"Wizard of  Oz.\" And again is not the long thunderous march of hungry strikers in  Zola's \"Germinal\" as awe-inspiring to those who feel the heart beat of  our age even as the heroic deeds of Hannibal's warriors were to his  contemporaries?    The world stage ever represents a change of participants. The one who  played the part of leading man in one century, may become a clown in  another. Entire social classes and casts that formerly commanded first  parts, are to-day utilized to make up stage decorations or as  figurantes. Plays representing the glory of knighthood or minnesingers  would only amuse to-day, no matter how serious they were intended to  appear. Once anything lies buried under the bulk of social changes, it  can affect coming generations only so far as the excavated skeleton  affects the geologist. This must be borne in mind by sincere stage art,  if it is not to remain in the stifling atmosphere of tradition, if it  does not wish to degrade a noble method, that helps to recognize and  disclose all that is rich and deep in the human into a commonplace,  hypocritical and stupid method. If the artist's creation is to have any  effect, it must contain elements of real life, and must turn its gaze  toward the dawn of the morn of a more beautiful and joyous world, with a  new and healthy generation, that feels deeply its relationship with all  human beings over the universe.    [Illustration]    In a report of the Russian government, it is stated that the conduct of  the soldiers in the struggles of the streets was such, that in no  instance did they transgress the limit which is prescribed to them in  their oath as soldiers. This is true. The soldier's oath prescribes  murder and cruelty as their patriotic duty.    [Illustration]    If government, were it even an ideal Revolutionary government, creates  no new force and is of no use whatever in the work of demolition which  we have to accomplish, still less can we count on it for the work of  reorganization which must follow that of demolition. The economic change  which will result from the Social Revolution will be so immense and so  profound, it must so change all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27238"],[0,"Woodworking Tools 1600-1900 (#9)"],[1,"th-century brace, or the  saw with the custom-fitted grip. This is a subjective reaction to a  pleasing form. It is the same reaction that prompted artists to use  tools as vehicles to help convey lessons in perspective, a frequent  practice in 19th-century art manuals. The harmony of related parts--the  balance of shaft and handle or the geometry of the twist--makes the  auger a decorative object. This is not to say that the ancient  woodworker's tool is not a document attesting a society's technical  proficiency--ingenuity, craftsmanship, and productivity. It is only to  suggest again that it is something more; a survival of the past whose  intrinsic qualities permit it to stand alone as a bridge between the  craftsman's hand and his work; an object of considerable appeal in which  integrity of line and form is not dimmed by the skill of the user nor by  the quality of the object produced by it.    In America, this integrity of design is derived from three centuries of  experience: one of heterogeneous character, the mid-17th to the  mid-18th; one of predominately English influence, from 1750 to 1850; and  one that saw the perfection of basic tools, by native innovators,  between 1850 and the early 20th century. In the two earlier periods, the  woodworking tool and the products it finished had a natural affinity  owing largely to the harmony of line that both the tool and finished  product shared. The later period, however, presents a striking contrast.  Hand-tool design, with few exceptions, continued vigorous and functional  amidst the confusion of an eclectic architecture, a flurry of rival  styles, the horrors of the jigsaw, and the excesses of Victorian taste.  In conclusion, it would seem that whether seeking some continuous thread  in the evolution of a national style, or whether appraising American  contributions to technology, such a search must rest, at least in part,  upon the character and quality of the hand tools the society has made  and used, because they offer a continuity largely unknown to other  classes of material survivals.
