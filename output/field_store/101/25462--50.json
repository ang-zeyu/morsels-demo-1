As military commander, as a great general, I eulogize the heroism and  self-sacrifice of my blind slaves and hirelings that have returned from  a successful campaign against a weaker nation. I speak of the great  benefit that the success of our arms will confer upon the people, I  emphasize its stimulating effect upon the progress of our country and  upon our civilization.    Yet while my anointed lips pour forth these solemn lies, my mind travels  over the bloody fields of carnage; I behold the thousands of the slain,  the mutilated bodies, the torn limbs, the streams of human blood....    I stand in the pulpit and call the faithful to prayer. I thunder eternal  curses upon the heads of the unbelievers; I threaten the people with the  torments of hell and I try to bribe them by the promise of heaven.  Believe, live and be saved, I cry. Or else you will die and be damned!    For I am the visible representative on earth of those invisible,  extra-mundane spirits whom man, in his fear and ignorance, created to  his own continued mental enslavement.    Terrified, sin lies prostrate at my feet. It does not know that a sick  conscience is a characteristic trait of all slaves. It is the universal  self-accuser. Were the people--individually and collectively--to sin on  a grand scale, were they to refuse to be the puppets of the man-made  idols--were that to happen, masters and slaves would cease to be.    The tyrants of the world are under great obligations to me. They must  not forget this. For if they should, I will unfold my solemn black robe,  I will smooth the hypocritical lines on my face--then shall the world  behold all the filth and corruption that I, Dignity, hide.\"    [Illustration]          PATERNALISTIC GOVERNMENT.    By THEODORE SCHROEDER.    (_Continuation._)      HERE is paternal solicitude with a vengeance in a law I requote from  Wordsworth Donisthorpe:    \"They shall have bows and arrows, and use the same of Sundays and  holidays; and leave all playing at tennis or foot-ball and other games  called quoits, dice, casting of stone, kailes, and other such importune  games. Forasmuch as labourers and grooms keep greyhounds and other dogs,  and on the holidays when good Christians be at church hearing divine  service, they go hunting in parks, warrens, and connigries, it is  ordained that no manner of layman which hath not lands to the value of  forty shillings a year, shall from henceforth keep any greyhound or  other dog to hunt, nor shall he use ferrets, nets, heys, harepipes nor  cords, nor any engines for to take or destroy deer, hares, nor conies,  nor other _gentlemen's game_, under pain of twelve months imprisonment.    \"For the great dearth that is in many places of the realm of poultry, it  is ordained that the price of a young capon shall not pass threepence,  and of an old fourpence, of a hen twopence, of a pullet a penny, of a  goose fourpence.    \"Esquires and gentlemen under the estate of a knight shall not wear  cloth of a higher price than four and a half marks, they shall wear no  cloth of gold nor silk nor silver, nor no manner of clothing  embroidered, ring button nor brooch of gold nor of silver, nor nothing  of stone nor no manner of fur; and their wives and daughters shall be of  the same condition as to their vesture and apparel, without any  turning-up or purfle or apparel of gold, silver nor of stone.    \"Because that servants and labourers will not nor by long season would,  serve and labour without outrageous and excessive hire, and much more  than hath been given to such servants and labourers in any time past, so  that for scarcity of the said servants and labourers the husbands and  land-tenants may not pay their rent nor live upon their lands, to the  great damage and loss as well of the Lords as of the Commons, it is  accorded and assented that the bailiff for husbandry shall take by the  years 13s. 3d. and his clothing once by the year at most; the master  hind 10s., the carter 10s., the shepherd 10s., the oxherd 6s. 8d., the  swineherd 6s., a woman labourer 6s., a dey 6s., a driver of the plough  7s. at the most, and every other labourer and servant according to his  degree; and less in the country where less was wont to be given, without  clothing, courtesy, or other reward by covenant. If any give or take by  covenant more than is above specified, at the first that they shall be  thereof attained, as well the givers as the takers, shall pay the value  of the excess so taken, and at the second time of their attainer the  double value of such excess, and at the third time the treble value of  such excess, and if the taker so attained have nothing whereof to pay  the said excess, he shall have forty days imprisonment.\"    Our puritan fathers had the same paternal solicitude as all other  tyrants. They made it a crime to disregard the Sabbath, or to deny  Scripture, or the truth of Christianity or of the Trinity. In the  records of the colony for September 1639 it is written: \"For as much as  it is evident unto this court that the common custom of drinking one to  another, is a mere useless ceremony, and draweth on that abominable  practice of drinking healths, and is also an occasion of much waste of  the good creatures, and of many other sin,\" etc. Then it declares that  such is a reproach to a Christian commonwealth, \"wherein the least evils  are not to be tolerated.\"    In the instructions of the Massachusetts Company to Endicott and his  Council, the trade in tobacco is only allowed to the \"old planters,\" \"if  they conceive that they cannot otherwise provide for their livelihood.\"  It is left to the discretion of Endicott and his Council \"to give way  for the present to their planting of it, in such manner and with such  restrictions\" as they may think fitting. \"But,\" it is added, \"we  absolutely forbid the sale of it or the use of it by any of our own  particular (private) men's servants, unless upon urgent occasion, for  the benefit of health, and taken privately.\" In the Records of the  Colony of Massachusetts for September 3, 1634, \"it is ordered that  victuallers or keepers of an ordinary shall not suffer any tobacco to be  taken into their houses, under penalty of 5s. for every offence to be  paid by the victualler, and 12d. by the party that takes it.\" \"Further  it is ordered that no person shall take tobacco publicly under the  penalty of 2s. 6d., nor privately in his own house or in the house of  another before strangers, and that two or more shall not take it  together anywhere, under the aforesaid penalty for every offence.\"    The laws which our Colonial fathers enacted against \"excess and bravery  in apparel\" are fitted to excite a smile. But there is something more  than ludicrous in the aspect of grave lawmakers passing judgment on all  the minutiae of dress, and finding matter of offence in an extra \"slash,\"  or a needless garniture of \"lace.\" Against this last-named article the  zeal of our Puritan fathers seems to have been especially stirred up. In  1634 it was ordered \"that no person, either man or woman, shall  hereafter make or buy any apparel, either woolen, silk, or linen with  any lace on it, silver, gold, silk, or thread, under the penalty of  forfeiture of such clothes.\" In 1636 it was enacted \"that no person,  after one month, shall make or sell any bone-lace or other lace, to be  worn upon any garment or linen, upon pain of 5s. the yard for every yard  of such lace so made, or sold, or set on; neither shall any tailor set  any lace upon any garment, upon pain of 10s. for every  offence,--provided that binding or small edging laces may be used upon  garments or linen.\" Again, three years later, a new edict was launched  at this obnoxious material, because \"there is much complaint of the  excessive wearing of lace and other superfluities, tending to little use  or benefit, but to the nourishing of pride and the exhausting of men's  estates, and also of evil example to others.\" The law of 1634 was indeed  repealed in 1644; but in 1651 the Court, to their great grief, are  compelled to try their hand at the work again, though frankly confessing  the impotence of all previous legislation, and evidently awakening to a  sense of the inherent difficulties of the subject. \"We acknowledge it,\"  say they, \"to be a matter of much difficulty, in regard of the blindness  of men's minds and the stubbornness of their wills, to set down exact  rules to confine all sorts of persons\"; and so, leaving the wealthier  class to their own conscience of fancy, they undertake to prescribe for  \"people of mean condition.\" It was therefore ordered (in 1651) that no  one whose estate is not of the value of L200 \"shall wear any gold or  silver lace, or gold or silver buttons, or any bone-lace above 2s. per  yard or silk hoods or scarfs\"; and moreover, the selectmen of the town  are required to fine anybody whom \"they shall judge to exceed their rank  and ability in the costliness or fashion of their apparel, in any  respect\"! And finally, a law passed in 1662 forbids \"children and  servants\" to wear any apparel \"exceeding the quality and condition of  their persons or estate,\" \"the grand jury and country court of the  shire\" being judges of the offence.    One provision of the law of 1634 against \"new and immodest fashions\" is  too remarkable to be omitted. It reads as follows: \"Moreover, it is  agreed, if any man shall judge the wearing of any the forenamed  particulars, new fashions, or long hair, or anything of the like nature,  to be uncomely or prejudicial to the common good, and the party  offending reform not the same, upon notice given him, that then the next  Assistant, being informed thereof, shall have power to bind the party so  offending to answer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27348"],[0,"The 2007 CIA World Factbook (#9)"],[1,"tick-borne viral disease; infection  may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue;  geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and  Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches  followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums;  mortality rate is approximately 30%.    Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and  humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection  may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood;  geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where  cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and  some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic  fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about  1% of cases.    Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated  with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by  sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7  days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.    water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in  freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:    Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans;  infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated  by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache,  vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in  kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress;  fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.    Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm Schistosoma;  fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of  parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated  water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys,  and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues  triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or  intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity;  mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due  to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of  infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the  reservoir for this parasite.    aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation of  aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:    Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys;  endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct  contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or  fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in  epidemic outbreaks.    respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an infectious  person:    Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of  the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important  bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of its potential  to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches,  and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by  respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact  resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal  distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48  hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease  occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the  \"Meningitis Belt\" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.    animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local  animals:    Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite  of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central  nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially  are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological  symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.      Manpower available for military service:  This entry gives the number  of males and females falling in the military age range for the country  and assumes that every individual is fit to serve.    Manpower fit for military service:  This entry gives the number of  males and females falling in the military age range for the country and  who are not otherwise disqualified for health reasons; accounts for the  health situation in the country and provides a more realistic estimate  of the actual number fit to serve.    Manpower reaching military service age annually:  This entry gives the  number of draft-age males and females entering the military manpower  pool in any given year and is a measure of the availability of draft-  age young adults.    Map references:  This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference  map on which a country may be found. The entry on Geographic  coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.    Maritime claims:  This entry includes the following claims, the  definitions of which are excerpted from the United Nations Convention  on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and  definitive descriptions:    territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond its  land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea,  described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this  sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well  as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right to  establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not  exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the  breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as  marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal  state; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic states.    contiguous zone - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a zone  contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it may  exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its customs,  fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its  territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the above laws and  regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea; the  contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the  baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured  (e.g. the US has claimed a 12-nautical mile contiguous zone in addition  to its 12-nautical mile territorial sea).    exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ as  a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a coastal  state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and  exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether  living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of  the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the  economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the  production of energy from the water, currents, and winds; jurisdiction  with regard to the establishment and use of artificial islands,  installations, and structures; marine scientific research; the  protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer limit  of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical miles from  the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is  measured.    continental shelf - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental  shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the  submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the  natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the  continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the  baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured  where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to  that distance; the continental margin comprises the submerged  prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and consists of the  seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise; wherever the  continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline,  coastal states may extend their claim to a distance not to exceed 350  nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2500  meter isobath; it does not include the deep ocean floor with its  oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.    exclusive fishing zone - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS,  some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an EEZ,  but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off their  coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often used;  the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or 200  nautical miles.      Median age:  This entry is the age that divides a population into two  numerically equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than  this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the  age distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from  a low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several  European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for the  importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by  implication, a low versus a higher median age.    Merchant marine:  Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged  in the carriage of goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all  nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil  rigs, etc. This entry contains information in four fields - total,  ships by type, foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.    Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for  those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage  is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc., that a ship  can carry when"]]]
