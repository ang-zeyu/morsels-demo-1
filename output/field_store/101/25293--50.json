Not only was he forced to fight  continual opposition, but the opening of the Manchester and Liverpool  road, which one might naturally have supposed would be a day of great  triumph, was, in spite of its success, attended by a series of  catastrophes. It was on September 15, 1830, that the ceremonies took  place, and long before the hour set for the gaily decorated trains to  pass the route was lined with excited spectators. The cities of  Liverpool and Manchester also were thronged with those eager to see the  engines start or reach their destination. There were, however, mingled  with the crowd many persons who were opposed to the new venture.\"    \"Opposed to it?\" Steve repeated with surprise.    \"Yes. It seems odd, doesn't it?\"    \"But why didn't they want a railroad?\" persisted the boy. \"I thought  that was the very thing they were all demanding.\"    \"You must not forget the condition of affairs at the time,\" said his  father. \"Remember the advent of steam machinery had deprived many of the  cotton spinners of their jobs and in consequence they felt bitterly  toward all steam inventions. Then in addition there were the stagecoach  drivers who foresaw that if the railroads supplanted coaches they would  no longer be needed. Moreover innkeepers were afraid that a termination  of stage travel would lessen their trade.\"    \"Each man had his own axe to grind, eh?\" smiled Steve.    \"I'm afraid so,\" his father answered. \"Human nature is very selfish, and  then as now men who worked for the general welfare regardless of their  own petty preferences were rare. To the side of the enemies of the  infant invention flocked every one with a grievance. The gentry argued  that the installation of locomotives would frighten the game out of the  country and ruin the shooting. Other opposers contended that the smoke  from the engines would not only kill the birds but in time kill the  patrons of the railroads as well. Still others protested that the  sparks from the funnels might set fire to the fields of grain or to the  forests. A swarm of added opponents dwelt on the fact that the  passengers would be made ill by the lurching of the trains; that the  rapid inrush of air would prevent their breathing; and that every sort  of people would be herded together without regard to class,--the latter  a very terrible calamity in a land where democracy was unknown. Even  such intelligent men as the poet Wordsworth and the famous writer Ruskin  came out hotly against the innovation, seeing in it nothing but evil.\"    \"Didn't the opening of the Manchester and Liverpool Railroad convince  the kickers they were wrong?\" asked Steve.    \"Unfortunately not,\" was Mr. Tolman's reply. \"You see several unlucky  incidents marred the complete success of the occasion. As the trains  trimmed with bunting and flowers started out the scene seemed gay  enough. On one car was a band of music; on another the directors of the  road; and on still another rode the Duke of Wellington, who at that time  was Prime Minister of England and had come down from London with various  other dignitaries to honor the enterprise. Church bells rang, cannon  boomed, and horns and whistles raised a din of rejoicing. But everywhere  among the throng moved a large group of unemployed laborers who had  returned from the Napoleonic wars in a discontented frame of mind and  resented the use of steam machinery. They were on edge for trouble and  if there were none they were ready to make it. So strong was the  resentment of this element against the government that it seemed  tempting Providence for the Prime Minister to venture into the  manufacturing district of Manchester. At first it was decided that he  would better omit the trip altogether; but on second thought it seemed  wiser for him not to add fuel to the flames by disappointing the mill  workers. The audience was in too ugly a mood to be angered. Therefore  Wellington bravely resolved to carry out the program and ride in one of  the open cars.\"    \"I hope nothing happened to him, Dad!\" gasped Doris breathlessly.    \"Nothing beyond a good many minor insults and indignities,\" responded  her father. \"He was, however, in constant peril, and to those who bore  the responsibility of the function he was a source of unceasing anxiety.  But in spite of the jeers of the mob, their crowding and pushing about  his car, he kept a smiling face like the true gentleman he was. Some of  the rougher element even went so far as to hurl missiles at him. You can  imagine how worried his friends were for his safety and how the  directors who had invited him fidgeted. And as if this worry were not  enough, by and by a fine rain began to fall and those persons riding in  the open coaches, as well as the decorations and the spectators, got  well drenched. Then there were delays on the turnouts while one train  passed another; and as a climax to these discouragements, Mr. Hickson,  a member of Parliament from Liverpool, got in the path of an approaching  engine, became confused and was run over; and although Stephenson  himself carried him by train to Liverpool he died that evening.\"    \"I should call the fete to introduce the steam engine into England a  most disastrous and forlorn one,\" remarked Mrs. Tolman.    \"Well, in reality it was not such a failure as it sounds,\" replied her  husband, \"for only those most closely connected with it sensed the  misfortunes that attended it. The greater part of the people along the  route were good-humored and pleased; they marveled at the trains as they  passed, cheered the Duke and the authorities with him, listened with  delight to the band, and made a jest of the rain. A holiday crowd, you  know, is usually quite patient. Hence the delays that fretted the guests  and the officials of the road did not annoy the multitudes so vitally.\"    \"Poor Stephenson really got some satisfaction out of the day then,\"  sighed Mrs. Tolman.    \"Oh, yes, indeed,\" said her husband. \"Although I fancy the death of Mr.  Hickson must have overshadowed his rejoicings. Notwithstanding this,  however, the railroad proved itself a practical venture, which was the  main thing. Such slight obstacles as the terror of the horses and the  fact that the tunnels into Liverpool were so low that the engines had to  be detached and the trains hauled into the yards by mules could be  remedied.\"    A flicker of humor danced in Mr. Tolman's eyes.    \"And did England begin to build railroads right away?\" Steve inquired.    \"Yes, and not only England but France also. Frenchmen who crossed the  Channel took home glowing accounts of the novel invention and  immediately the French Government realized that that country must also  have railroads. But just as the conservative element in England had been  sceptical and blocked Stephenson's progress--or tried to--so a  corresponding faction in France did all it could to cry down the  enterprise. Even those who upheld the introduction of the roads  advocated them for only short distances out of Paris; a long trunk route  they labeled as an absurdity. Iron was too expensive, they argued;  furthermore the mountains of the country rendered extensive railroading  impossible. France did not need railroads anyway. Nevertheless the  little group of seers who favored the invention persisted and there was  no stopping the march of which they were the heralds. Railroads had come  to stay and they stayed.\"    \"It was a fortunate thing they did, wasn't it?\" murmured Doris.    \"A very fortunate thing,\" returned Mr. Tolman heartily. \"Every great  invention is usually suggested by a great need and so it was with this  one. By 1836 the craze for railroad building swept both hemispheres. In  England the construction of lines to most out-of-the-way and  undesirable places were proposed, and the wildest schemes for propelling  trains suggested; some visionaries even tried sails as a medium of  locomotion instead of steam. Rich and poor rushed to invest their  savings in railroads and alas, in many cases the misguided enthusiasts  lost every shilling of their money in the project. Great business firms  failed, banking houses were ruined, and thousands of workmen were thrown  out of employment. In consequence a reaction followed and it was years  before wary investors could again be induced to finance a railroad. In  the interim both engines and coaches underwent improvement, especially  the third-class carriage which in the early days was nothing more than  an open freight car and exposed its unhappy patrons to snow, rain, and  freezing weather.\"    \"Great Scott!\" cried Steve. \"I should say there was room for improvement  if that was the case.\"    \"There was indeed,\" echoed his father. \"In fact, it was a long time  before travel by train became a pleasure. Most of the engines used pitch  pine or soft coal as a fuel and as there were no guards on the  smokestacks to prevent it, the smoke, soot, and cinders used to blow  back from the funnels and shower the passengers. On the first railroad  trip from New York to Albany those sitting outside the coaches were  compelled to put up umbrellas to protect themselves from these  annoyances.\"    \"Imagine it!\" burst out Doris, with a rippling laugh.    \"Nor were the umbrellas of any service for long,\" continued Mr. Tolman,  \"for the sparks soon burned their coverings until nothing but the steel  ribs remained.\"    \"I don't wonder the trip was not a pleasure,\" smiled Mrs. Tolman.    \"Yet, in spite of its discomfort, it was a novelty and you must not  forget that, as I said before, the public of that period was a simple  and less exacting one than is the public of to-day. We make a frightful  fuss if we are jolted, chilled, crowded, delayed, or made uncomfortable;  but our forefathers were a hale and hearty lot--less overworked perhaps,  less nervous certainly, less indulged.

As he drew nearer, his heart sunk within him to see how starved, and  hollow-eyed, and woe-begone they were; and his horror was at its height  when, as he entered his own lodge, he beheld his favorite and friend,  the Pipe-bearer, also on all fours, smoothing the floor with the palms  of his hands to make it a comfortable sitting-place for the bears on  their return from the dance.    It did not take Grasshopper a long time to resolve what he should do. He  immediately resumed power in the village, bestowed a sound cudgeling  upon the bears, and sent them off to live in the mountains, among their  own people, as bears should; restored to the people all their rights;  gave them plenty to eat and drink; exerting his great strength in  hunting, in rebuilding their lodges, keeping in check their enemies, and  doing all the good he could to every body.    Peace and plenty soon shone and showered upon the spot; and, never once  thinking of all his wild and wanton frolics, the people blessed  Grasshopper for all his kindness, and sincerely prayed that his name  might be held in honor for a thousand years to come, as no doubt it  will.    Little Pipe-bearer stood by Grasshopper in all his course, and admired  his ways as much now that he had taken to being orderly and useful, as  in the old times, when he was walking a mile a minute, and in mere  wantonness bringing home whole forests in his arms for fire-wood, in  midsummer.    It was a great old age to which Grasshopper lived, and when at last he  came to die, there was not a dry eye in all that part of the world where  he spent his latter days.          V.    THE TWO JEEBI.      There lived a hunter in the North, who had a wife and one child. His  lodge stood far off in the forest, several days' journey from any other.  He spent his days in hunting, and his evenings in relating to his wife  the incidents that had befallen him. As game was very abundant, he found  no difficulty in killing as much as they wanted. Just in all his acts,  he lived a peaceful and happy life.    One evening during the winter season, it chanced that he remained out  longer than usual, and his wife began to fear that some accident had  befallen him. It was already dark. She listened attentively, and at last  heard the sound of approaching footsteps.    Not doubting that it was her husband, she went to the door and beheld  two strange females. She bade them enter, and invited them to remain.  She observed that they were total strangers in the country. There was  something so peculiar in their looks, air and manner, that she was  disturbed by their presence. They would not come near to the fire. They  sat in a remote part of the lodge, shy and taciturn, and drew their  garments about them in such a manner as nearly to hide their faces. So  far as she could judge, they were pale, hollow-eyed, and long-visaged,  very thin and emaciated.    There was but little light in the lodge, as the fire was low, and its  fitful flashes, by disclosing their white faces and then dropping them  in sudden darkness, served rather to increase than to dispel her fears.    \"Merciful Spirit!\" cried a voice from the opposite part of the lodge;  \"there are two corpses clothed with garments!\"    The hunter's wife turned around, but seeing nobody save her little  child, staring across from under his blanket, she said to herself, \"The  boy can not speak; the sounds were but the gusts of wind.\" She trembled,  and was ready to sink to the earth.    Her husband at this moment entered, and in some measure relieved her  alarm. He threw down the carcass of a large fat deer.    \"Behold what a fine and fat animal!\" cried the mysterious females; and  they immediately ran and pulled off pieces of the whitest fat, which  they greedily devoured.    The hunter and his wife looked on with astonishment, but remained  silent. They supposed that their guests might have been stricken with  famine.    The next day, however, the same unusual conduct was repeated. The  strange females again tore off the fat and devoured it with eagerness.  The third day, the hunter thought that he would anticipate their wants  by tying up a share of the hunt, and placing it apart for their express  use. They accepted it, but still appeared dissatisfied, and went to the  wife's portion and tore off more.    The hunter and his wife were surprised at such rude and unaccountable  conduct, but they remained silent, for they respected their guests, and  had observed that they had been attended with marked good luck during  the sojourn of these mysterious visitors in their lodge.    In other respects, the deportment of the females was strictly  unexceptionable. They were modest, distant, and silent. They never  uttered a word during the day. At night they would occupy themselves in  procuring wood, which they carried to the lodge, and then, restoring the  implements exactly where they had found them, resume their places  without speaking. They were never known to stay out until daylight. They  never laughed or jested.    The winter was nearly passed away, when, one evening, the hunter was  abroad later than usual. The moment he came in and laid down his day's  hunt, as was his custom, before his wife, the two females seized upon  the deer and began to tear off the fat in so unceremonious a way that  her anger was excited. She constrained herself, however, in a good  degree, but she could not conceal her feelings, though she said but  little.    The strange guests observed the state of her mind, and they became  uneasy, and withdrew further still into the remote gloom of the lodge.  The good hunter saw the eclipse that was darkening the quiet of his  lodge, and carefully inquired of its cause; but his wife denied having  used any words of complaining or reproach.    They retired to their couches, and the hunter tried to compose himself  to sleep, but could not, for the sighs and sobs of the two females were  incessant. He arose on his couch and addressed them as follows:    \"Tell me,\" said he, \"what is it that gives you pain of mind and causes  you to bemoan your presence here. Has my wife given you offense, or  trespassed upon the rights of hospitality?\"    They replied in the negative. \"We have been treated by you with kindness  and affection. It is not for any slight we have received that we weep.  Our mission is not to you only. We come from the other land to test  mankind, and to try the sincerity of the living. Often we have heard the  bereaved by death say that if the lost could be restored, they would  devote their lives to make them happy. We have been moved by the bitter  lamentations which have reached the place of the departed, and have  come to make proof of the sincerity of those who have lost friends. We  are your two dead sisters. Three moons were allotted us by the Master of  Life to make the trial. More than half the time had been successfully  passed, when the angry feelings of your wife indicated the irksomeness  you felt at our presence, and has made us resolve on our departure.\"    They continued to talk to the hunter and his wife, gave them  instructions as to a future life, and pronounced a blessing upon them.    \"There is one point,\" they added, \"of which we wish to speak. You have  thought our conduct very strange and rude in possessing ourselves of the  choicest parts of your hunt. _That_ was the point of trial selected to  put you to. It is the wife's peculiar privilege. You love your wife. For  another to usurp what belongs to her, we know to be the severest test of  her goodness of heart, and consequently of your temper and feelings. We  knew your manners and customs, but we came to prove you, not by  complying with but by violating them. Pardon us. We are the agents of  him who sent us. Peace to your dwelling. Farewell!\"    When they ceased, total darkness filled the lodge. No object could be  seen. The inmates heard the lodge-door open and shut, but they never saw  more of the Two Spirits.    The hunter found the success which they had promised. He became  celebrated in the chase, and never wanted for any thing. He had many  children, all of whom grew up to manhood; and he who had lain in the  lodge, a little child, while the Jeebi dwelt there, led them in all good  deeds, and health, peace, and long life were the rewards of the hunter's  hospitality.          VI.    OSSEO, THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR.      There once lived an Indian in the north who had ten daughters, all of  whom grew up to womanhood. They were noted for their beauty, especially  Oweenee, the youngest, who was very independent in her way of thinking.  She was a great admirer of romantic places, and spent much of her time  with the flowers and winds and clouds in the open air. Though the flower  were homely, if it was fragrant--though the wind were rough, if it was  healthful--and though the cloud were dark, if it embosomed the fruitful  rain, she knew how, in spite of appearances, to acknowledge the good  qualities concealed from the eye. She paid very little attention to the  many handsome young men who came to her father's lodge for the purpose  of seeing her.    Her elder sisters were all sought in marriage, and one after the other  they went off to dwell in the lodges of their husbands; but Oweenee was  deaf to all proposals of the kind. At last she married an old man  called Osseo, who was scarcely able to walk, and who was too poor to  have things like others. The only property he owned in the world was the  walking-staff which he carried in his hand. Though thus poor and homely,  Osseo was a devout and good man; faithful in all his duties, and  obedient in all things to the Good Spirit. Of course they jeered and  laughed at"]]]
