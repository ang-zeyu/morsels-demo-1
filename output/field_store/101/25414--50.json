(#9)"],[1,"achievement  of the genuine,--in order to get it a man must be an actor!--Victor Hugo and  Richard Wagner--they both prove one and the same thing: that in declining  civilisations, wherever the mob is allowed to decide, genuineness becomes  superfluous, prejudicial, unfavourable. The actor, alone, can still kindle  _great_ enthusiasm.--And thus it is his _golden age_ which is now  dawning,--his and that of all those who are in any way related to him. With  drums and fifes, Wagner marches at the head of all artists in declamation,  in display and virtuosity. He began by convincing the conductors of  orchestras, the scene-shifters and stage-singers, not to forget the  orchestra:--he \"delivered\" them from monotony.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The movement that Wagner  created has spread even to the land of knowledge: whole sciences  pertaining to music are rising slowly, out of centuries of scholasticism.  As an example of what I mean, let me point more particularly to  _Riemann's_ services to rhythmics; he was the first who called attention  to the leading idea in punctuation--even for music (unfortunately he did so  with a bad word; he called it \"phrasing\").--All these people, and I say it  with gratitude, are the best, the most respectable among Wagner's  admirers--they have a perfect right to honour Wagner. The same instinct  unites them with one another; in him they recognise their highest type,  and since he has inflamed them with his own ardour they feel themselves  transformed into power, even into great power. In this quarter, if  anywhere, Wagner's influence has really been _beneficent_. Never before  has there been so much thinking, willing, and industry in this sphere.  Wagner endowed all these artists with a new conscience: what they now  exact and _obtain_ from themselves, they had never exacted before Wagner's  time--before then they had been too modest. Another spirit prevails on the  stage since Wagner rules there the most difficult things are expected,  blame is severe, praise very scarce,--the good and the excellent have  become the rule. Taste is no longer necessary, nor even is a good voice.  Wagner is sung only with ruined voices: this has a more \"dramatic\" effect.  Even talent is out of the question. Expressiveness at all costs, which is  what the Wagnerian ideal--the ideal of decadence--demands, is hardly  compatible with talent. All that is required for this is virtue--that is to  say, training, automatism, \"self-denial\". Neither taste, voices, nor  gifts, Wagner's stage requires but one thing: _Germans!_{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The definition  of a German: an obedient man with long legs.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} There is a deep significance  in the fact that the rise of Wagner should have coincided with the rise of  the \"Empire\": both phenomena are a proof of one and the same  thing--obedience and long legs.--Never have people been more obedient, never  have they been so well ordered about. The conductors of Wagnerian  orchestras, more particularly, are worthy of an age, which posterity will  one day call, with timid awe, the _classical age of war_.    Wagner understood how to command; in this respect, too, he was a great  teacher. He commanded as a man who had exercised an inexorable will over  himself--as one who had practised lifelong discipline: Wagner was, perhaps,  the greatest example of self-violence in the whole of the history of art  (--even Alfieri, who in other respects is his next-of-kin, is outdone by  him. The note of a Torinese).          12.      This view, that our actors have become more worthy of respect than  heretofore, does not imply that I believe them to have become less  dangerous.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But who is in any doubt as to what I want,--as to what the  _three requisitions_ are concerning which my wrath and my care and love of  art, have made me open my mouth on this occasion?    _That the stage should not become master of the arts._    _That the actor should not become the corrupter of the genuine._    _That music should not become an art of lying._    _Friedrich Nietzsche._          Postscript      The gravity of these last words allows me at this point to introduce a few  sentences out of an unprinted essay which will at least leave no doubt as  to my earnestness in regard to this question. The title of this essay is:  \"What Wagner has cost us.\"    One pays dearly for having been a follower of Wagner. Even to-day a vague  feeling that this is so, still prevails. Even Wagner's success, his  triumph, did not uproot this feeling thoroughly. But formerly it was  strong, it was terrible, it was a gloomy hate throughout almost  three-quarters of Wagner's life. The resistance which he met with among us  Germans cannot be too highly valued or too highly honoured. People guarded  themselves against him as against an illness,--not with arguments--it is  impossible to refute an illness,--but with obstruction, with mistrust, with  repugnance, with loathing, with sombre earnestness, as though he were a  great rampant danger. The aesthetes gave themselves away when out of three  schools of German philosophy they waged an absurd war against Wagner's  principles with \"ifs\" and \"fors\"--what did he care about principles, even  his own!--The Germans themselves had enough instinctive good sense to  dispense with every \"if\" and \"for\" in this matter. An instinct is weakened  when it becomes conscious: for by becoming conscious it makes itself  feeble. If there were any signs that in spite of the universal character  of European decadence there was still a modicum of health, still an  instinctive premonition of what is harmful and dangerous, residing in the  German soul, then it would be precisely this blunt resistance to Wagner  which I should least like to see underrated. It does us honour, it gives  us some reason to hope: France no longer has such an amount of health at  her disposal. The Germans, these _loiterers par excellence_, as history  shows, are to-day the most backward among the civilised nations of Europe;  this has its advantages,--for they are thus relatively the youngest.    One pays dearly for having been a follower of Wagner. It is only quite  recently that the Germans have overcome a sort of dread of him,--the desire  to be rid of him occurred to them again and again.(12) Does anybody  remember a very curious occurrence in which, quite unexpectedly towards  the end, this old feeling once more manifested itself? It happened at  Wagner's funeral. The first Wagner Society, the one in Munich, laid a  wreath on his grave with this inscription, which immediately became  famous: \"Salvation to the Saviour!\" Everybody admired the lofty  inspiration which had dictated this inscription, as also the taste which  seemed to be the privilege of the followers of Wagner. Many also, however  (it was singular enough), made this slight alteration in it: \"Salvation  _from_ the Saviour\"--People began to breathe again--    One pays dearly for having been a follower of Wagner. Let us try to  estimate the influence of this worship upon culture. Whom did this  movement press to the front? What did it make ever more and more  pre-eminent?--In the first place the layman's arrogance, the arrogance of  the art-maniac. Now these people are organising societies, they wish to  make their taste prevail, they even wish to pose as judges _in rebus  musicis et musicantibus_. Secondly: an ever increasing indifference  towards severe, noble and conscientious schooling in the service of art,  and in its place the belief in genius, or in plain English, cheeky  dilettantism (--the formula for this is to be found in the  _Mastersingers_). Thirdly, and this is the worst of all: _Theatrocracy_--,  the craziness of a belief in the pre-eminence of the theatre, in the right  of the theatre to rule supreme over the arts, over Art in general.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But  this should be shouted into the face of Wagnerites a hundred times over:  that the theatre is something lower than art, something secondary,  something coarsened, above all something suitably distorted and falsified  for the mob. In this respect Wagner altered nothing: Bayreuth is grand  Opera--and not even good opera.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The stage is a form of Demolatry in the  realm of taste, the stage is an insurrection of the mob, a _plebiscite_  against good taste.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The case of Wagner proves this fact: he captivated  the masses--he depraved taste, he even perverted our taste for opera!--    One pays dearly for having been a follower of Wagner. What has  Wagner-worship made out of spirit? Does Wagner liberate the spirit? To him  belong that ambiguity and equivocation and all other qualities which can  convince the uncertain without making them conscious of why they have been  convinced. In this sense Wagner is a seducer on a grand scale. There is  nothing exhausted, nothing effete, nothing dangerous to life, nothing that  slanders the world in the realm of spirit, which has not secretly found  shelter in his art, he conceals the blackest obscurantism in the luminous  orbs of the ideal. He flatters every nihilistic (Buddhistic) instinct and  togs it out in music; he flatters every form of Christianity, every  religious expression of decadence. He that hath ears to hear let him hear:  everything that has ever grown out of the soil of impoverished life, the  whole counterfeit coinage of the transcendental and of a Beyond found its  most sublime advocate in Wagner's art, not in formulae (Wagner is too  clever to use formulae), but in the persuasion of the senses which in their  turn makes the spirit weary and morbid. Music in the form of Circe {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} in  this respect his last work is his greatest masterpiece. In the art of  seduction \"Parsifal\" will for ever maintain its rank as a stroke of  genius.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} I admire this work. I would fain have composed it myself. Wagner  was never"]]]
