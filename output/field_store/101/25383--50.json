It keeps me warm and keeps me alive until I can find  the first green plants.  Perhaps you have noticed that early in  the spring I am as thin as I was fat in the fall.  This is  because I have used up the fat, waiting for the first green  things to appear.\"    \"Do you have many enemies?\" asked Peter Rabbit, who has so many  himself that he is constantly thinking of them.    \"Not many, but enough,\" growled Johnny Chuck.  \"Reddy Fox, Old Man  Coyote, men and Dogs are the worst.  Of course, when I was small I  always had to be watching out for Hawks, and of course, like all  the rest of us little folks, I am afraid of Shadow the Weasel.  Reddy Fox has tried to dig me out more than once, but I can dig  faster than he can.  If he ever gets me cornered, he'll find that I  can fight.  A small Dog surprised me once before I could get to my  hole and I guess that Dog never will tackle another Woodchuck.\"    \"Time is up,\" interrupted Old Mother Nature.  \"Johnny Chuck has a  big cousin out in the mountains of the Great West named Whistler,  and on the prairies of the Great West he has a smaller cousin named  Yap Yap.  They are quite important members of the Marmot family, and  to-morrow I'll tell you about them if you want me to.   You need not  come tomorrow, Johnny Chuck, unless you want to,\" she added.    Johnny Chuck hung his head, for he was a little ashamed that he had  been so unwilling to come that morning.    \"If you please, Mother Nature,\" said he, \"I think I'll come.  I didn't  know I had any close relatives, and I want to know about them.\"    So it was agreed that all would be on hand at sun-up the next  morning, and then everybody started for home to think over the  things they had learned.        CHAPTER VIII  Whistler and Yap Yap    Johnny Chuck was the first one on hand the next morning.  The fact  is, Johnny was quite excited over the discovery that he had some  near relatives.  He always had supposed that the Woodchucks were a  family by themselves.  Now that he knew that he had some close  relatives, he was filled with quite as much curiosity as ever Peter  Rabbit possessed.  Just as soon as Old Mother Nature was ready to  begin, Johnny Chuck was ready with a question.  \"If you please,\"  said he, \"who are my nearest relatives?\"    \"The Marmots of the Far West,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"You  know, you are a Marmot, and these cousins of yours out there are  a great deal like you in a general way.  The biggest and handsomest  of all is Whistler, who lives in the mountains of the Northwest.  The fact is, he is the biggest of all the Marmot family.\"    \"Is he much bigger than Johnny Chuck?\" asked Peter Rabbit.    \"Considerably bigger,\" replied Old Mother Nature, nodding her head.  \"Considerably bigger.  I should think he would weight twice as much  as Johnny.\"    Johnny's eyes opened very wide.  \"My!\" he exclaimed, \"I should like  to see him.  Does he look like me?\"    \"In his shape he does,\" said Old Mother Nature, \"but he has a very  much handsomer coat.  His coat is a mixture of dark brown and white  hairs which give him a grayish color.  The upper part of his head,  his feet and nails are black, and so are his ears.  A black band  runs from behind each ear down to his neck.  His chin is pure white  and there is white on his nose.  Underneath he is a light, rusty  color.  His fur is thicker and softer than yours, Johnny; this is  because he lives where it is colder.  His tail is larger, somewhat  bushier, and is a blackish-brown.\"    \"If you please, why is he called Whistler?\" asked Johnny Chuck eagerly.    \"Because he has a sharp, clear whistle which can be heard a very long  distance,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"He sits up just as you do.  If he sees danger approaching he whistles, as a warning to all his  relatives within hearing.\"    \"I suppose it is foolish to ask if he lives in a hole in the ground  as Johnny Chuck does,\" spoke up Peter Rabbit.    \"He does,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"All Marmots live in holes in  the ground, but Whistler lives in entirely different country.  He  lives up on the sides of the mountains, often so high that no trees  grow there and the ground is rocky.  He digs his hole down in between  the rocks.\"    \"It must be a nice, safe hole,\" said Peter.  \"I guess he doesn't  have to worry about being dug out by Reddy fox.\"    \"You guessed quite right,\" laughed Old Mother Nature.  \"Nevertheless,  he has reason to fear being dug out.  You see, out where he lives,  Grizzly, the big cousin of Buster Bear, also lives, and Grizzly is  very fond of a Marmot dinner when he can get one.  He is so big and  strong and has such great claws that he can pull the rocks apart and  dig Whistler out.  By the way, I forgot to tell you that Whistler is  also called the Gray Marmot and the Hoary Marmot.  He lives on grass  and other green things and, like Johnny Chuck, gets very fat in the  fall and then sleeps all winter.  There are one or two other Marmots  in the Far West who live farther south than does Whistler, but their  habits are much the same as those of Whistler and Johnny Chuck.  None  of them are social.  I mean by that you never find two Marmot homes  very close together.  In this they differ from Johnny's smaller cousin,  Yap Yap the Prairie Dog.  Yap Yap wouldn't be happy if he didn't have  close neighbors of his own kind.  He has one of the most social  natures of all my little people.\"    \"Tell us about him,\" begged Happy Jack Squirrel before Johnny Chuck,  who is naturally slow, could ask for the same thing.    \"Yap Yap is the smallest of the Marmot family,\" said Old Mother  Nature.  \"In a way he is about as closely related to the Ground  Squirrels as he is to the Marmots.  Johnny Chuck has only four  claws on each front foot, but Yap Yap has five, just as the Ground  Squirrels have.  He looks very much like a small Chuck dressed in  light yellow-brown.  His tail for the most part is the same color  as his coat, but the end is black, though there is one member of  the family whose tail has a white tip.  In each cheek is a small  pouch, that is, a small pocket, and this is one of the things that  shows how closely related to the Spermophiles he is.    \"As I said before, Yap Yap is very social by nature.  He lives on  the great open plains of the West and Southwest, frequently where it  is very dry and rain seldom falls.  When you find his home you are  sure to find the homes of many more Prairie Dogs very close at hand.  Sometimes there are hundreds and hundreds of homes, making a regular  town.  This is because the Prairie Dogs dearly love the company of  their own kind.\"    \"Does Yap Yap dig the same kind of a hole that I do?\" asked  Johnny Chuck.    \"In a way it is like yours,\" replied Old Mother Nature, \"but at the  same time it is different.  In the first place, it goes almost  straight down for a long distance.  In the second place there is no  mound of sand in front of Yap Yap's doorway.  Instead of that the  doorway is right in the very middle of the mound of sand.  One reason  for this is that when it does rain out where Yap Yap lives it rains  very hard indeed, so that the water stands on the ground for a short  time.  The ground being flat, a lot of water would run down into  Yap Yap's home and make him most uncomfortable if he did not do  something to keep it out.  So he brings the sand out and piles it  all the way around his doorway and presses it down with his nose.  In that way he builds up a firm mound which he uses for two purposes;  one is to keep the water from running down the hole, and the other is  as a sort of watch tower.  He sits on the top of his mound to watch  for his enemies.  His cousins with the white tail digs a hole more  like yours.    \"Yap Yap loves to visit his neighbors and to have them visit him.  They are lively little people and do a great deal of talking among  themselves.  The instant one of them sees an enemy he gives a signal.  Then every Prairie Dog scampers for his own hole and dives in head  first.  Almost at once he pops his head out again to see what the  danger may be.\"    \"How can he do that without going clear to the bottom to turn  around?\" demanded Peter.    \"I wondered if any of you would think of that question,\" chuckled  Old Mother Nature.  \"Just a little way down from the entrance Yap  Yap digs a little room at one side of his tunnel.  All he has to do  is to scramble into that, turn around and then pop his head out.  As I said before, his tunnel goes down very deep; then it turns and  goes almost equally far underground.  Down there he has a nice  little bedroom.  Sometimes he has more than one.\"    \"If it is so dry out where he lives, how does he get water to drink?\"  asked Happy Jack.    \"He doesn't have to drink,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"Some folks  think that he digs down until he finds water way down underneath,  but this isn't so.  He doesn't have to have water.  He gets all  the moisture he needs from the green things he eats.\"    \"I suppose, like the rest of us, he has lots of enemies?\" said Peter.    Old Mother Nature nodded.  \"Of course,\" said she.  \"Old Man Coyote  and Reddy Fox are very fond of Prairie Dog.  So are members of the  Hawk family.  Then in some places there is a cousin of Shadow the  Weasel called the Black-footed Ferret.  He is to be feared most of  all because he can follow Yap Yap down into his hole.  There is a  cousin of Hooty the Owl called the Burrowing Owl because it builds  its home in a hole in the ground.  You are likely to find many  Burrowing Owls living in Prairie Dog villages.  Also you are apt  to find Buzztail the Rattlesnake there.    \"A lot of people believe that Yap Yap, Buzztail and the little  Burrowing Owl are the best of friends and often live together in  the same hole.  This isn't so at all.  Buzztail is very fond of  young Prairie Dog and so is the Burrowing Owl.

[Sidenote: EUROPEANS AND NATIVES.]    As to the people of the land, both Hindu and Muhammadan, I discerned at  once, what I might have fully anticipated, that between them and us  there was a national, social, and religious gulf. Some were in our  houses as servants. We had to do with them in various ways; we could not  go out without seeing them on every side. There was on the part of many  a courteous bearing towards each other; there was in many cases a kindly  feeling; but the barriers which separated us could not be for any length  of time forgotten. I speedily saw that some Europeans looked with  contempt on the natives, as essentially of a lower order in creation;  but the better class of Europeans, the higher in position and education,  as a rule, regarded them with respect, and treated them not only with  justice but with kindness. Native servants received as kind treatment as  servants do in well-conducted families in our own country, and in many  cases repaid this kindness by devoted attachment and the efficient  discharge of the work entrusted to them. When native gentlemen came in  contact with Europeans of the higher class, all the honour was accorded  to them to which by their position they were entitled. Even in this case  there were national and religious differences, which effectually  prevented the intimacy which is often maintained where such differences  do not exist.    [Sidenote: EURASIANS.]    Within the first year I got an insight into a large and growing class,  who were connected with both Europeans and natives, and yet did not  belong to either. I refer to persons of mixed blood; some almost as  dark, in many cases altogether as dark, as ordinary natives--many of  these being descendants of Portuguese; others, again, so fair that their  Indian blood is scarcely observed; some in the lowest grade of society,  very poor and very ignorant; and others, with many intermediate links,  most respectable members of the community in character, knowledge,  position, and means. All these, whatever may be their rank, are  Christians by profession, and they dress so far as they can after the  European fashion; but the poorer class, in food and accommodation live  very much as natives do, and mainly speak the native language. The  people of mixed blood are called by different names--Eurasians, East  Indians, and not infrequently by a name to which they most rightly  object, Half-caste.    I was surprised and sorry to observe the feeling with which many  Europeans regarded this class. They were looked down upon as of an  inferior grade, who, whatever might be their character or position, were  not entitled to rank with Europeans. In the dislike of natives shown by  some Europeans there was something to remind one of the American feeling  in regard to colour, though of a much milder type; but I was not  prepared for the degree in which the feeling prevailed in reference to  Eurasians, though I might have been had I remembered that the slightest  tinge of African blood, a tinge to many eyes not perceptible, had been  considered in America a fatal taint. I speedily observed the effect the  feeling had on Eurasians in producing an unpleasant sensitiveness, and  impairing the confidence and respect indispensable to social  intercourse.    Since that time I have understood the causes of this feeling much better  than I could have then done. The most candid and thoughtful of the class  will allow that as a community they labour under great disadvantages.  Though they have native blood in their veins they are entirely separate  from natives in those things to which natives attach the highest value;  and though by the profession of Christianity, by the adoption of  European habits so far as circumstances allow, and by the use of the  English language, they draw to Europeans, yet they are forced to feel  they do not belong to them. They occupy an awkward middle position, and  the knowledge that they do leads to unpleasant grating. Then they have  not had the bracing which comes from residence in a Christian land.  Though proud of their Christian name and profession, they have been  injuriously affected by the moral atmosphere of their surroundings. The  lower their social position, the closer has been their connection with  the lower class of natives, and the more hurtful have been the  influences under which they have come. Eurasians are noted for their  excellent penmanship, and a great number from generation to generation  have found employment in Government offices, the greater number as mere  copyists, but a few as confidential clerks and accountants, whose  services have been highly appreciated by their official superiors. A  considerable number have risen to important offices in the  administration of the country. An increasing number are able to take  their place in every respect abreast of their European brethren.  Individuals have gone to England, and have succeeded in getting by  competition into the Covenanted Civil Service. The class has been  steadily growing for years in intelligence and character; and as the  members of their families are enjoying educational advantages to a  greater extent than at any previous period, there is every reason to  hope progress in the future will be still more rapid than in the past.  The distinction between them and persons of pure European blood will  thus become less and less a barrier to social intercourse; they will be  delivered from the unpleasantness the barrier has often caused, their  character will grow in strength, and they will become increasingly  fitted for exerting a happy influence on the native community. In the  case of individuals the distinction is now practically ignored. There  are no more honoured and honourable persons in India than some who  belong to this class. There have always been devoted Christians among  them, and of late years an increasing number have come under the power  of Divine grace.    It has been often remarked that one of the most pleasing traits of  native society is reproduced among Eurasians--the tie of kinship  prompting those who are in better circumstances to help their needy  relatives, often to the giving of large pecuniary aid, not unfrequently  to the taking of them into their houses. In the humbler portions of the  community there is often seen a patriarchal household like that so often  seen in native society.    [Sidenote: THE CLIMATE OF NORTHERN INDIA.]    The new-comer's experience of climate prepares him for what he has to  expect during his future residence. We have three marked seasons in the  North-Western Provinces, the one melting gradually into the other--the  hot season beginning in March and ending in June, the rainy season  beginning with July and ending in October, and the cold weather  beginning with November and ending in February. The seasons may thus be  described in a general way, but in fact every year differs somewhat from  others, as they do in our own country. The hot weather is sensibly felt  before March begins, and the heat of March is far less than that of the  succeeding months. The first burst of the rains is often before the  middle of June, but after that burst, called the \"little rainy season,\"  it is not uncommon to have a spell of very hot sunny weather. In some  years, indeed, there is so much weather of this kind during what is  called the rainy season, that the heat is most intense, and the crops  are burnt up. Towards the end of September there is commonly the last  great outpour of rain, and as October advances there is the cooling  freshness of the approaching cold weather, with enough of heat in the  day-time to tell us it has not quite let go its grasp. December and  January are our coldest months. In England, after an unpropitious  summer, the remark is often made, \"We have had no summer!\" and in the  same manner in India, when the temperature has been high in the cold  season, and we have not had the expected bracing, we say, \"We have had  no winter!\" Yet as in our own country, so in India; we have our marked  seasons, though we cannot be sure of the weather at any particular  period.    As India is an immense region, a great continent, with every variety of  scenery, with plains extending hundreds of miles, and vast stretches of  forests, with table-lands and lofty mountains, with land of every  description from barren sand to the richest alluvial soil, the climate  and products of its different countries are so different, that the  statements made about one region, however correct, when applied to the  whole are utterly misleading. I have been describing the seasons of the  North-Western Provinces; and yet, as Benares is in the lower part of  these provinces, its climate is considerably different from that of the  country farther north and west. The farther north we travel the longer  and colder is the cold season, and as a rule the hotter and briefer is  the hot season. On one occasion the heat was so great in Benares in  March that we found the night punkah pleasant; but on reaching Delhi,  nearly six hundred miles distant, a few days afterwards, instead of  seeking a night punkah we were thankful to have blankets to keep  ourselves warm.    [Sidenote: THE HOT SEASON.]    I have a vivid recollection of my experiences of the climate during my  first year. During our voyage on the Ganges the heat during the day was  like that of a cloudless July in England, and at night it was pleasantly  cool, the wood of the flat speedily giving off the heat it had taken in  during the day, and the flow of the river contributing to our comfort.  Reaching Benares as April was setting in, I speedily felt I was getting  into the experience of an Indian hot season. The doors were"]]]
