It is much the fashion with those who delight to deal in doleful  vaticinations as to the future destiny of England, to dwell with great  emphasis upon the amazing diversity of conditions to be seen here--to  exaggerate the suffering of the millions of our poor, and to place them  in a sort of rhetorical contrast with the extravagant wealth of a  favored few. But there is still something in the mutual relations of all  classes of society in this country that proves a healthy condition to  exist in our body politic, that shows that we are really brethren, and  that whether interest or kind sympathies govern us we are still one  people--with great differences of opinion among us indeed, openly  expressed by all, but still with a feeling prevalent in all classes of  the community that we form one people, and that we are, from the most  powerful to the most weak, bound together by ties of great regard as  well as national brotherhood.\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE LATE CATASTROPHE ON LAKE ERIE.--Our whole country has been once more  shocked by an appalling and unnecessary loss of life, from the burning  of the steamer Griffith. We use the expression, _unnecessary loss of  life_, not from any hasty impulse, or undue excitement, but in view of  the evident and undeniable fact, that two hundred and fifty human beings  have been sacrificed for a culpable neglect on the part of the  proprietors of the steamer to furnish suitable protection. No one  competent to judge will doubt that every individual on the Griffith  might have been saved had she been provided with life-boats. The avarice  of proprietors has generally prevented their use, though the cost of a  sufficient number for each steamer would not exceed _one thousand  dollars_. The lives of hundreds of men, women and children are of little  account to a corporation, when weighed against a thousand dollars of  their capital stock. Life-boats cannot save their _burning property_,  and why impair their own interests for the saving a few hundred lives  now and then? We have the approbation of every _disinterested_ citizen,  when we suggest to Congress some law which shall compel steamboat owners  to protect their passengers in case of accident, by suitable life-saving  apparatus. Fire-proof paints and other incombustible materials are very  wisely demanded, but our navigation is exposed to a thousand other  dangers, which can be guarded against by no other means so effectually  as by life-boats; and it should be within the duties of the inspectors  to see that steamers are in all instances furnished with a sufficient  number of them to contain their full complement of passengers.           *       *       *       *       *    M. LAMARTINE has left Paris to visit his estate in the East.          _RECENT DEATHS._      JANE PORTER.--As in the case of the recent death of Miss Edgeworth, it  is singular that so little notice has been taken of the demise of Jane  Porter, one of the most distinguished novelists which England has  produced. Miss Porter may be said to have been the first who introduced  that beautiful kind of fiction, the historical romance, which has added  such amusement and interest to English literature. The author of  \"Thaddeus of Warsaw\" and \"The Scottish Chiefs\" has done much to deserve  the lasting respect and gratitude of her country.    The family of this excellent woman and able writer, according to the  _Illustrated News_, is of Irish descent. Her father was an officer of  dragoons in the British service; he married a Miss Blenkinsopp, of the  Northumbrian house of Blenkinsopp, which Camden styles \"a right ancient  and generous family.\" Miss Porter's father died in the prime of life,  and left his widow with five almost infant children, in slender  circumstances. The great talents of this orphan family raised them to  affluence and distinction. Three of the children were sons; of these,  the eldest perished in a dangerous climate abroad, at the commencement  of a promising career; the second (the present Dr. William Ogilvie  Porter, of Bristol) became a physician, and practiced successfully. The  third was the late Sir Robert Ker Porter, K.C.H., distinguished as an  author, a painter, and a soldier: some of our finest battle-pieces are  the work of his pencil, and he himself followed heroes to the field; he  was with Sir John Moore when he fell victoriously at Corunna, and he  earned a high reputation throughout the Peninsular war. He afterward  became a diplomatist, and was latterly consul at Venezuela. His  \"Traveling Sketches in Russia and Egypt\" procured him also an author's  fame. Sir Robert Ken Porter died suddenly about seven years ago; he left  by his wife, a Russian lady, an only daughter, who is married, and  resides in Russia. The two sisters of these brothers Porter were even  more distinguished. The younger of them, Miss Anna Maria Porter, became  an authoress at twelve years of age; she wrote many successful novels,  of which the most popular were the \"Hungarian Brothers,\" the \"Recluse of  Norway,\" and the \"Village of Mariendorpt.\" She died at her brother's  residence at Bristol, on the 6th of June, 1832. The elder sister, Miss  Jane Porter, the subject of this notice, was born at Durham, where her  father's regiment was quartered at the time. She, with her sister, Anna  Maria, received her education under a famous Scotch tutor, Mr. Fulton,  at Edinburgh, where her widowed mother lived with her children in their  early years. The family afterward removed, first to Ditton, and thence  to Esher, in Surrey, where Mrs. Porter, a most intelligent and agreeable  lady, resided with her daughters for many years, until her death, in  1831. Mrs. Porter was buried in the churchyard at Esher; and on her tomb  the passer-by may read this inscription, \"Here lies Jane Porter, a  Christian widow.\" As a novelist Miss Jane Porter obtained the highest  celebrity. Her three most renowned productions were her \"Thaddeus of  Warsaw,\" written when she was about twenty years of age, her \"Scottish  Chiefs,\" and her \"Pastor's Fireside.\" \"Thaddeus of Warsaw\" had immense  popularity; it was translated into most of the Continental languages,  and Poland was loud in its praise. Kosciusko sent the author a ring  containing his portrait. General Gardiner, the British Minister at  Warsaw, could not believe that any other than an eye-witness had written  the story, so accurate were the descriptions, although Miss Porter had  not then been in Poland. The \"Scottish Chiefs\" was equally successful.  With regard to this romance, it is known that Sir Walter Scott admitted  to George IV., one day, in the library at Carlton Palace, that the  \"Scottish Chiefs\" was the parent in his mind of the Waverley Novels. In  a letter written to her friend Mr. Litchfield, about three months ago,  Miss Porter, speaking of these novels, said:--\"I own I feel myself a  kind of sybil in these things; it being full fifty years ago since my  'Scottish Chiefs' and 'Thaddeus of Warsaw' came into the then untrodden  field. And what a splendid race of the like chroniclers of generous  deeds have followed, brightening the track as they have advanced! The  author of 'Waverley,' and all his soul-stirring 'Tales of my Landlord,'  &c. Then comes Mr. James, with his historical romances, on British and  French subjects, so admirably uniting the exquisite fiction with the  fact, that the whole seems equally verity. But my feeble hand\" (Miss  Porter was ailing when she wrote the letter) \"will not obey my wish to  add more to this host of worthies. I can only find power to say with my  trembling pen that I cannot but esteem them as a respected link with my  past days of lively interest in all that might promote the virtue and  true honor of my contemporaries from youth to age.\" These eloquent words  become the more touching, when we consider that within three months  after they were written, this admirable lady quitted this life in the  honored maturity of her fame.    Miss Porter wrote, in conjunction with her sister, \"Tales round a  Winter's Hearth.\" She was also an indefatigable contributor to the  periodicals of the day. Her biographical sketch of Colonel Denham, the  African traveler, in the _Naval and Military Journal_, was much admired  as one of the most affecting tributes ever paid to departed merit. Miss  Porter was a Chanoiness of the Polish order of St. Joachim, which honor  was conferred upon her after the publication of \"Thaddeus of Warsaw.\"  She is, in her portraits, generally represented in the habit of this  order. Miss Porter died on the 24th ult., at the residence of her  brother, Dr. Porter, in Portland-square, Bristol. That brother, so  tenderly beloved by her, and so justly respected by all who know him, is  now the last survivor of this brilliant company of brothers and sisters;  and he, too, we are sorry to say, is in an enfeebled state from  paralysis, aggravated by the recent shock of his gifted relative's  demise. Except himself and his married niece in Russia, there remains no  representative of a family which England has good cause to hold in  grateful remembrance.           *       *       *       *       *    THE COUNT DE VITTRE.--The Paris journals announce the death of one of  the most distinguished officers of the French army, General Count de  Vittre, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor, &c. Charles de Raity de  Villeneuve, Count de Vittre, was descended from an old and noble family  of Poitou, was the comrade of Napoleon at the Military School, and took  a glorious part in the campaign of Russia, where he was severely  wounded.

The association made her feel a little  uncomfortable, and Jean Briggerland, whose intuition was a little short  of uncanny, must have read the doubt in her face.    \"Mrs. Meredith expected to see us, didn't she, Margaret?\" she said,  addressing the twittering hostess. \"Surely you told her we were great  friends?\"    \"Of course I did, my dear. Knowing your dear cousin and his dear father,  it was not remarkable that I should know the whole of the family,\" and  she smiled wisely from one to the other.    Of course! How absurd she was, thought Lydia. She had almost forgotten,  and probably Jack Glover had forgotten too, that the Briggerlands and  the Merediths were related.    She found herself talking in a corner of the room with the girl, and  fell to studying her face anew. A closer inspection merely consolidated  her earlier judgment. She smiled inwardly as she remembered Jack  Glover's ridiculous warning. It was like killing a butterfly with a  steam hammer, to loose so much vengeance against this frail piece of  china.    \"And how do you feel now that you're very rich?\" asked Jean kindly.    \"I haven't realised it yet,\" smiled Lydia.    Jean nodded.    \"I suppose you have yet to settle with the lawyers. Who are they? Oh  yes, of course Mr. Glover was poor Jim's solicitor.\" She sighed. \"I  dislike lawyers,\" she said with a shiver, \"they are so heavily paternal!  They feel that they and they only are qualified to direct your life and  your actions. I suppose it is second nature with them. Then, of course,  they make an awful lot of money out of commissions and fees, though I'm  sure Jack Glover wouldn't worry about that. He's really a nice boy,\" she  said earnestly, \"and I don't think you could have a better friend.\"    Lydia glowed at the generosity of this girl whom the man had so  maligned.    \"He has been very good to me,\" she said, \"although, of course, he is a  little fussy.\"    Jean's lips twitched with amusement.    \"Has he warned you against me?\" she asked solemnly. \"Has he told you  what a terrible ogre I am?\" And then without waiting for a reply: \"I  sometimes think poor Jack is just a little--well, I wouldn't say mad,  but a little queer. His dislikes are so violent. He positively loathes  Margaret, though why I have never been able to understand.\"    \"He doesn't hate me,\" laughed Lydia, and Jean looked at her strangely.    \"No, I suppose not,\" she said. \"I can't imagine anybody hating you,  Lydia. May I call you by your Christian name?\"    \"I wish you would,\" said Lydia warmly.    \"I can't imagine anybody hating you,\" repeated the girl thoughtfully.  \"And, of course, Jack wouldn't hate you because you're his client--a  very rich and attractive client too, my dear.\" She tapped the girl's  cheek and Lydia, for some reason, felt foolish.    But as though unconscious of the embarrassment she had caused, Jean went  on.    \"I don't really blame him, either. I've a shrewd suspicion that all  these warnings against me and against other possible enemies will  furnish a very excellent excuse for seeing you every day and acting as  your personal bodyguard!\"    Lydia shook her head.    \"That part of it he has relegated already,\" she said, giving smile for  smile. \"He has appointed Mr. Jaggs as my bodyguard.\"    \"Mr. Jaggs?\" The tone was even, the note of inquiry was not strained.    \"He's an old gentleman in whom Mr. Glover is interested, an old army  pensioner. Beyond the fact that he hasn't the use of his right arm, and  limps with his left leg, and that he likes beer and cheese, he seems an  admirable watch dog,\" said Lydia humorously.    \"Jaggs?\" repeated the girl. \"I wonder where I've heard that name before.  Is he a detective?\"    \"No, I don't think so. But Mr. Glover thinks I ought to have some sort  of man sleeping in my new flat and Jaggs was duly engaged.\"    Soon after this Mr. Marcus Stepney came over and Lydia found him rather  uninteresting. Less boring was Briggerland, for he had a fund of stories  and experiences to relate, and he had, too, one of those soft soothing  voices that are so rare in men.    It was dark when she came out with Mr. and Miss Briggerland, and she  felt that the afternoon had not been unprofitably spent.    For she had a clearer conception of the girl's character, and was  getting Jack Glover's interest into better perspective. The mercenary  part of it made her just a little sick. There was something so  mysterious, so ugly in his outlook on life, and there might not be a  little self-interest in his care for her.    She stood on the step of the house talking to the girl, whilst Mr.  Briggerland lit a cigarette with a patent lighter. Hyde Park Crescent  was deserted save for a man who stood near the railings which protected  the area of Mrs. Cole-Mortimer's house. He was apparently tying his shoe  laces.    They went down on the sidewalk, and Mr. Briggerland looked for his car.    \"I'd like to take you home. My chauffeur promised to be here at four  o'clock. These men are most untrustworthy.\"    From the other end of the Crescent appeared the lights of a car. At  first Lydia thought it might be Mr. Briggerland's, and she was going to  make her excuses for she wanted to go home alone. The car was coming  too, at a tremendous pace. She watched it as it came furiously toward  her, and she did not notice that Mr. Briggerland and his daughter had  left her standing alone on the sidewalk and had withdrawn a few paces.    Suddenly the car made a swerve, mounted the sidewalk and dashed upon  her. It seemed that nothing could save her, and she stood fascinated  with horror, waiting for death.    Then an arm gripped her waist, a powerful arm that lifted her from her  feet and flung her back against the railings, as the car flashed past,  the mud-guard missing her by an inch. The machine pulled up with a jerk,  and the white-faced girl saw Briggerland and Jean running toward her.    \"I should never have forgiven myself if anything had happened. I think  my chauffeur must be drunk,\" said Briggerland in an agitated voice.    She had no words. She could only nod, and then she remembered her  preserver, and she turned to meet the solemn eyes of a bent old man,  whose pointed, white beard and bristling white eyebrows gave him a  hawk-like appearance. His right hand was thrust into his pocket. He was  touching his battered hat with the other.    \"Beg pardon, miss,\" he said raucously, \"name of Jaggs! And I have  reported for dooty!\"          Chapter X      Jack Glover listened gravely to the story which the girl told. He had  called at her lodgings on the following morning to secure her signature  to some documents, and breathlessly and a little shamefacedly, she told  him what had happened.    \"Of course it was an accident,\" she insisted, \"in fact, Mr. and Miss  Briggerland were almost knocked down by the car. But you don't know how  thankful I am your Mr. Jaggs was on the spot.\"    \"Where is he now?\" asked Jack.    \"I don't know,\" replied the girl. \"He just limped away without another  word and I did not see him again, though I thought I caught a glimpse of  him as I came into this house last night. How did he come to be on the  spot?\" she asked curiously.    \"That is easily explained,\" replied Jack. \"I told the old boy not to let  you out of his sight from sundown to sun up.\"    \"Then you think I'm safe during the day?\" she rallied him.    He nodded.    \"I don't know whether to laugh at you or to be very angry,\" she said,  shaking her head reprovingly. \"Of course it was an accident!\"    \"I disagree with you,\" said Jack. \"Did you catch a glimpse of the  chauffeur?\"    \"No,\" she said in surprise. \"I didn't think of looking at him.\"    He nodded.    \"If you had, you would probably have seen an old friend, namely, the  gentleman who carried you off from the Erving Theatre,\" he said quietly.    It was difficult for Lydia to analyse her own feelings. She knew that  Jack Glover was wrong, monstrously wrong. She was perfectly confident  that his fantastic theory had no foundation, and yet she could not get  away from his sincerity. Remembering Jean's description of him as \"a  little queer\" she tried to fit that description into her knowledge of  him, only to admit to herself that he had been exceptionally normal as  far as she was concerned. The suggestion that his object was mercenary,  and that he looked upon her as a profitable match for himself, she  dismissed without consideration.    \"Anyway, I like your Mr. Jaggs,\" she said.    \"Better than you like me, I gather from your tone,\" smiled Jack. \"He's  not a bad old boy.\"    \"He is a very strong old boy,\" she said. \"He lifted me as though I were  a feather--I don't know now how I escaped. The steering gear went  wrong,\" she explained unnecessarily.    \"Dear me,\" said Jack politely, \"and it went right again in time to  enable the chauffeur to keep clear of Briggerland and his angel  daughter!\"    She gave a gesture of despair.    \"You're hopeless,\" she said. \"These things happened in the dark ages;  men and women do not assassinate one another in the twentieth century.\"    \"Who told you that?\" he demanded. \"Human nature hasn't changed for two  thousand years. The instinct to kill is as strong as ever, or wars would  be impossible. If any man or woman could commit one cold-blooded murder,  there is no reason why he or she should not commit a hundred. In  England, America, and France fifty cold-blooded murders are detected  every year. Twice that number are undetected. It does not make the crime  more impossible because the criminal is good looking.\"    \"You're hopeless,\" she said again, and Jack made no further attempt to  convince her.    On the Thursday of that week she exchanged her lodgings for a handsome  flat in Cavendish Place, and Mrs. Morgan had promised to join her a week  later, when she had settled up her own business"]]]
