[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#9)"],[1," its outer regions are concerned, is a  mass of gas and not a solid body, there would be nothing incredible in  the supposition that spots are occasionally endowed with movements of  their own like ships on the ocean. It seems, however, from the facts  before us that the different zones on the sun, corresponding to what we  call the torrid and temperate zones on the earth, persist in rotating  with velocities which gradually decrease from the equator towards the  poles. It seems probable that the interior parts of the sun do not  rotate as if the whole were a rigidly connected mass. The mass of the  sun, or at all events its greater part, is quite unlike a rigid body,  and the several portions are thus to some extent free for independent  motion. Though we cannot actually see how the interior parts of the sun  rotate, yet here the laws of dynamics enable us to infer that the  interior layers of the sun rotate more rapidly than the outer layers,  and thus some of the features of the spot movements can be accounted  for. But at present it must be confessed that there are great  difficulties in the way of accounting for the distribution of spots and  the law of rotation of the sun.    In the year 1826 Schwabe, a German astronomer, commenced to keep a  regular register of the number of spots visible on the sun. After  watching them for seventeen years he was able to announce that the  number of spots seemed to fluctuate from year to year, and that there  was a period of about ten years in their changes. Subsequent  observations have confirmed this discovery, and old books and  manuscripts have been thoroughly searched for information of early  date. Thus a more or less complete record of the state of the sun as  regards spots since the beginning of the seventeenth century has been  put together. This has enabled astronomers to fix the period of the  recurring maximum with greater accuracy.    The course of one of the sun-spot cycles may be described as follows:  For two or three years the spots are both larger and more numerous than  on the average; then they begin to diminish, until in about six or seven  years from the maximum they decline to a minimum; the number of the  spots then begins to increase, and in about four and a half years the  maximum is once more attained. The length of the cycle is, on an  average, about eleven years and five weeks, but both its length and the  intensity of the maxima vary somewhat. For instance, a great maximum  occurred in the summer of 1870, after which a very low minimum occurred  in 1879, followed by a feeble maximum at the end of 1883; next came an  average minimum about August, 1889, followed by the last observed  maximum in January, 1894. It is not unlikely that a second period of  about sixty or eighty years affects the regularity of the eleven-year  period. Systematic observations carried on through a great many years to  come will be required to settle this question, as the observations of  sun-spots previous to 1826 are far too incomplete to decide the issues  which arise.    A curious connection seems to exist between the periodicity of the spots  and their distribution over the surface of the sun. When a minimum is  about to pass away the spots generally begin to show themselves in  latitudes about 30 deg. north and south of the sun's equator; they then  gradually break out somewhat nearer to the equator, so that at the time  of maximum frequency most of them appear at latitudes not greater than  16 deg.. This distance from the sun's equator goes on decreasing till the  time of minimum. Indeed, the spots linger on very close to the equator  for a couple of years more, until the outbreak signalising the  commencement of another period has commenced in higher latitudes.    We have still to note an extraordinary feature which points to an  intimate connection between the phenomena of sun-spots and the purely  terrestrial phenomena of magnetism. It is of course well known that the  needle of a compass does not point exactly to the north, but diverges  from the meridian by an angle which is different in different places and  is not even constant at the same place. For instance, at Greenwich the  needle at present points in a direction 17 deg. West of North, but this  amount is subject to very slow and gradual changes, as well as to very  small daily oscillations. It was found about fifty years ago by Lamont  (a Bavarian astronomer, but a native of Scotland) that the extent of  this daily oscillation increases and decreases regularly in a period  which he gave as 10-1/3 years, but which was subsequently found to be  11-1/10 years, exactly the same as the period of the spots on the sun.  From a diligent study of the records of magnetic observations it has  been found that the time of sun-spot maximum always coincides almost  exactly with that of maximum daily oscillation of the compass needle,  while the minima agree similarly. This close relationship between the  periodicity of sun-spots and the daily movements of the magnetic needle  is not the sole proof we possess that there is a connection of some sort  between solar phenomena and terrestrial magnetism. A time of maximum  sun-spots is a time of great magnetic activity, and there have even been  special cases in which a peculiar outbreak on the sun has been  associated with remarkable magnetic phenomena on the earth. A very  interesting instance of this kind is recorded by Professor Young, who,  when observing at Sherman on the 3rd August, 1872, perceived a very  violent disturbance of the sun's surface. He was told the same day by a  member of his party, who was engaged in magnetic observations and who  was quite in ignorance of what Professor Young had seen, that he had  been obliged to desist from his magnetic work in consequence of the  violent motion of his magnet. It was afterwards found from the  photographic records at Greenwich and Stonyhurst that the magnetic  \"storm\" observed in America had simultaneously been felt in England. A  similar connection between sun-spots and the aurora borealis has also  been noticed, this fact being a natural consequence of the well-known  connection between the aurora and magnetic disturbances. On the other  hand, it must be confessed that many striking magnetic storms have  occurred without any corresponding solar disturbance,[5] but even those  who are inclined to be sceptical as to the connection between these two  classes of phenomena in particular cases can hardly doubt the remarkable  parallelism between the general rise and fall in the number of sun-spots  and the extent of the daily movements of the compass needle.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--The Texture of the Sun and a small Spot.]    We have now described the principal solar phenomena with which the  telescope has made us acquainted. But there are many questions connected  with the nature of the sun which not even the most powerful telescope  would enable us to solve, but which the spectroscope has given us the  means of investigating.    What we receive from the sun is warmth and light. The intensely heated  mass of the sun radiates forth its beams in all directions with  boundless prodigality. Each beam we feel to be warm, and we see to be  brilliantly white, but a more subtle analysis than mere feeling or mere  vision is required. Each sunbeam bears marks of its origin. These marks  are not visible until a special process has been applied, but then the  sunbeam can be made to tell its story, and it will disclose to us much  of the nature of the constitution of the great luminary.    We regard the sun's light as colourless, just as we speak of water as  tasteless, but both of those expressions relate rather to our own  feelings than to anything really characteristic of water or of sunlight.  We regard the sunlight as colourless because it forms, as it were, the  background on which all other colours are depicted. The fact is, that  white is so far from being colourless that it contains every known hue  blended together in certain proportions. The sun's light is really  extremely composite; Nature herself tells us this if we will but give  her the slightest attention. Whence come the beautiful hues with which  we are all familiar? Look at the lovely tints of a garden; the red of  the rose is not in the rose itself. All the rose does is to grasp the  sunbeams which fall upon it, extract from these beams the red which they  contain, and radiate that red light to our eyes. Were there not red rays  conveyed with the other rays in the sunbeam, there could be no red rose  to be seen by sunlight.    The principle here involved has many other applications; a lady will  often say that a dress which looks very well in the daylight does not  answer in the evening. The reason is that the dress is intended to show  certain colours which exist in the sunlight; but these colours are not  contained to the same degree in gaslight, and consequently the dress has  a different hue. The fault is not in the dress, the fault lies in the  gas; and when the electric light is used it sends forth beams more  nearly resembling those from the sun, and the colours of the dress  appear with all their intended beauty.    The most glorious natural indication of the nature of the sunlight is  seen in the rainbow. Here the sunbeams are refracted and reflected from  tiny globes of water in the clouds; these convey to us the sunlight, and  in doing so decompose the white beams into the seven primary hues--red,  orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.    [Illustration: PLATE A.

His tall and agile figure, his warlike air, his love  of hard work, his hoarse voice, his fiery and austere character, his  carelessness in regard to dress, his mature age, his tried courage, his  taciturn habit, the length and weight of his sword, all combined to  render him formidable. Therefore no one could have been chosen more  suitable for putting down the rebels, for forcing their entrenchments,  and for putting them to flight.\"    Hardly had he taken up a position in the market town of Labarre, which  was to be his headquarters, than he was informed that a gathering of  fanatics had been seen on the little plain of Fondmorte, which formed a  pass between two valleys. He ordered out his Spanish steed, which he was  accustomed to ride in the Turkish manner--that is, with very short  stirrups, so that he could throw himself forward to the horse's ears, or  backward to the tail, according as he wished to give or avoid a mortal  blow. Taking with him eighteen men of his own company and twenty-five  from the town, he at once set off for the place indicated, not  considering any larger number necessary to put to rout a band of  peasants, however numerous.    The information turned out to be correct: a hundred Reformers led by  Esprit Seguier had encamped in the plain of Fondmorte, and about eleven  o'clock in the morning one of their sentinels in the defile gave the  alarm by firing off his gun and running back to the camp, shouting, \"To  arms!\" But Captain Poul, with his usual impetuosity, did not give the  insurgents time to form, but threw himself upon them to the beat of the  drum, not in the least deterred by their first volley. As he had  expected, the band consisted of undisciplined peasants, who once  scattered were unable to rally. They were therefore completely routed.  Poul killed several with his own hand, among whom were two whose heads  he cut off as cleverly as the most experienced executioner could have  done, thanks to the marvellous temper of his Damascus blade. At this  sight all who had till then stood their ground took to flight, Poul at  their heels, slashing with his sword unceasingly, till they disappeared  among the mountains. He then returned to the field of battle, picked up  the two heads, and fastening them to his saddlebow, rejoined his  soldiers with his bloody trophies,--that is to say, he joined the  largest group of soldiers he could find; for the fight had turned into a  number of single combats, every soldier fighting for himself. Here he  found three prisoners who were about to be shot; but Poul ordered that  they should not be touched: not that he thought for an instant of  sparing their lives, but that he wished to reserve them for a public  execution. These three men were Nouvel, a parishioner of Vialon, Moise  Bonnet of Pierre-Male, and Esprit Seguier the prophet.    Captain Poul returned to Barre carrying with him his two heads and his  three prisoners, and immediately reported to M. Just de Baville,  intendant of Languedoc, the important capture he had made. The prisoners  were quickly tried. Pierre Nouvel was condemned to be burnt alive at the  bridge of Montvert, Molise Bonnet to be broken on the wheel at Deveze,  and Esprit Seguier to be hanged at Andre-de-Lancise. Thus those who were  amateurs in executions had a sufficient choice.    However, Moise Bonnet saved himself by becoming Catholic, but Pierre  Nouvel and Esprit Seguier died as martyrs, making profession of the new  faith and praising God.    Two days after the sentence on Esprit Seguier had been carried out, the  body disappeared from the gallows. A nephew of Laporte named Roland had  audaciously carried it off, leaving behind a writing nailed to the  gibbet. This was a challenge from Laporte to Poul, and was dated from  the \"Camp of the Eternal God, in the desert of Cevennes,\" Laporte  signing himself \"Colonel of the children of God who seek liberty of  conscience.\" Poul was about to accept the challenge when he learned that  the insurrection was spreading on every side. A young man of Vieljeu,  twenty-six years of age, named Solomon Couderc, had succeeded Esprit  Seguier in the office of prophet, and two young lieutenants had joined  Laporte. One of these was his nephew Roland, a man of about thirty,  pock-marked, fair, thin, cold, and reserved; he was not tall, but very  strong, and of inflexible courage. The other, Henri Castanet of  Massevaques, was a keeper from the mountain of Laygoal, whose skill as a  marksman was so well known that it was said he never missed a shot. Each  of these lieutenants had fifty men under him.    Prophets and prophetesses too increased apace, so that hardly a day  passed without reports being heard of fresh ones who were rousing whole  villages by their ravings.    In the meantime a great meeting of the Protestants of Languedoc had been  held in the fields of Vauvert, at which it had been resolved to join  forces with the rebels of the Cevennes, and to send a messenger thither  to make this resolution known.    Laporte had just returned from La Vaunage, where he had been making  recruits, when this good news arrived; he at once sent his nephew Roland  to the new allies with power to pledge his word in return for theirs,  and to describe to them, in order to attract them, the country which he  had chosen as the theatre of the coming war, and which, thanks to its  hamlets, its woods, its defiles, its valleys, its precipices, and its  caves, was capable of affording cover to as many bands of insurgents as  might be employed, would be a good rallying-ground after repulse, and  contained suitable positions for ambuscades. Roland was so successful in  his mission that these new \"soldiers of the Lord,\" as they called  themselves, on learning that he had once been a dragoon, offered him the  post of leader, which he accepted, and returned to his uncle at the head  of an army.    Being thus reinforced, the Reformers divided themselves into three  bands, in order to spread abroad their beliefs through the entire  district. One went towards Soustele and the neighbourhood of Alais,  another towards St. Privat and the bridge of Montvert, while the third  followed the mountain slope down to St. Roman le Pompidou, and Barre.    The first was commanded by Castanet, the second by Roland, and the third  by Laporte.    Each party ravaged the country as it passed, returning deathblow for  deathblow and conflagration for conflagration, so that hearing one after  another of these outrages Captain Poul demanded reinforcements from M.  de Broglie and M. de Baville, which were promptly despatched.    As soon as Captain Poul found himself at the head of a sufficient number  of troops, he determined to attack the rebels. He had received  intelligence that the band led by Laporte was just about to pass through  the valley of Croix, below Barre, near Temelague. In consequence of this  information, he lay in ambush at a favourable spot on the route. As soon  as the Reformers who were without suspicion, were well within the narrow  pass in which Poul awaited them, he issued forth at the head of his  soldiers, and charged the rebels with such courage and impetuosity that  they, taken by surprise, made no attempt at resistance, but, thoroughly  demoralised, spread over the mountain-side, putting a greater and  greater distance at, every instant between themselves and the enemy,  despite the efforts of Laporte to make them stand their ground. At last,  seeing himself deserted, Laporte began to think of his own safety. But  it was already too late, for he was surrounded by dragoons, and the only  way of retreat open to him lay over a large rock. This he successfully  scaled, but before trying to get down the other side he raised his hands  in supplication to Heaven; at that instant a volley was fired, two  bullets struck him, and he fell head foremost down the precipice.    When the dragoons reached the foot of the rock, they found him dead. As  they knew he was the chief of the rebels, his body was searched: sixty  Louis was found in his pockets, and a sacred chalice which he was in the  habit of using as an ordinary drinking-cup. Poul cut off his head and  the heads of twelve other Reformers found dead on the field of battle,  and enclosing them in a wicker basket, sent them to M. Just de Baville.    The Reformers soon recovered from this defeat and death, joined all  their forces into one body, and placed Roland at their head in the place  of Laporte. Roland chose a young man called Couderc de Mazel-Rozade, who  had assumed the name of Lafleur, as his lieutenant, and the rebel forces  were not only quickly reorganised, but made complete by the addition of  a hundred men raised by the new lieutenant, and soon gave a sign that  they were again on the war-path by burning down the churches of  Bousquet, Cassagnas, and Prunet.    Then first it was that the consuls of Mende began to realise that it was  no longer an insurrection they had on hand but a war, and Mende being  the capital of Gevaudan and liable to be attacked at any moment, they  set themselves to bring into repair their counterscarps, ravelins,  bastions, gates, portcullises, moats, walls, turrets, ramparts,  parapets, watchtowers, and the gear of their cannon, and having laid in  a stock of firearms, powder and ball, they formed eight companies each  fifty strong, composed of townsmen, and a further band of one hundred  and fifty peasants drawn from the neighbouring country.
