This is not  true, for we may say that all affections, or nearly all, produce in us  an alteration which is distinct from all other sorts of motion, for  that which is affected need not suffer either increase or diminution or  any of the other sorts of motion. Thus alteration is a distinct sort of  motion; for, if it were not, the thing altered would not only be  altered, but would forthwith necessarily suffer increase or diminution  or some one of the other sorts of motion in addition; which as a matter  of fact is not the case. Similarly that which was undergoing the  process of increase or was subject to some other sort of motion would,  if alteration were not a distinct form of motion, necessarily be  subject to alteration also. But there are some things which undergo  increase but yet not alteration. The square, for instance, if a gnomon  is applied to it, undergoes increase but not alteration, and so it is  with all other figures of this sort. Alteration and increase,  therefore, are distinct.    Speaking generally, rest is the contrary of motion. But the different  forms of motion have their own contraries in other forms; thus  destruction is the contrary of generation, diminution of increase, rest  in a place, of change of place. As for this last, change in the reverse  direction would seem to be most truly its contrary; thus motion upwards  is the contrary of motion downwards and vice versa.    In the case of that sort of motion which yet remains, of those that  have been enumerated, it is not easy to state what is its contrary. It  appears to have no contrary, unless one should define the contrary here  also either as 'rest in its quality' or as 'change in the direction of  the contrary quality', just as we defined the contrary of change of  place either as rest in a place or as change in the reverse direction.  For a thing is altered when change of quality takes place; therefore  either rest in its quality or change in the direction of the contrary  may be called the contrary of this qualitative form of motion. In this  way becoming white is the contrary of becoming black; there is  alteration in the contrary direction, since a change of a qualitative  nature takes place.        Part 15    The term 'to have' is used in various senses. In the first place it is  used with reference to habit or disposition or any other quality, for  we are said to 'have' a piece of knowledge or a virtue. Then, again, it  has reference to quantity, as, for instance, in the case of a man's  height; for he is said to 'have' a height of three or four cubits. It  is used, moreover, with regard to apparel, a man being said to 'have' a  coat or tunic; or in respect of something which we have on a part of  ourselves, as a ring on the hand: or in respect of something which is a  part of us, as hand or foot. The term refers also to content, as in the  case of a vessel and wheat, or of a jar and wine; a jar is said to  'have' wine, and a corn-measure wheat. The expression in such cases has  reference to content. Or it refers to that which has been acquired; we  are said to 'have' a house or a field. A man is also said to 'have' a  wife, and a wife a husband, and this appears to be the most remote  meaning of the term, for by the use of it we mean simply that the  husband lives with the wife.    Other senses of the word might perhaps be found, but the most ordinary  ones have all been enumerated."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#9)"],[1,"  come a-courting in a _hood_.    So, though she gave him \"drams of Black Cherry Brandy\" and Canary to  drink and comfits and lump sugar to eat, while he so pressed her to name  her settlement on him, and while the wig and coach questions were so  adversely met, she would not answer yes, and he regretted making more  haste than good speed. At last the lover of the \"kisses sweeter than  Canary\" critically notes that his mistress has not on \"Clean Linen;\" and  the next day he writes rather sourly, \"I did not bid her draw off her  Glove as sometime I had done. Her dress was not so clean as sometime it  had been;\" the beginning of the end was plainly come. That week he  forbade her being invited to a family dinner, and she in turn gave a  \"treat\" from which he was excluded. Thus ended his fourth wooing.    The next widow on whom he called was Widow Belknap, but eftsoons he  transferred his attention to Widow Ruggles and wrote thus sentimentally  to her brother:         \"I remember when I was going from school at Newbury to have       sometime met your sisters Martha and Mary in Hanging Sleeves coming       home from their school in Chandlers Lane, and have had the pleasure       of speaking to them. And I could find it in my heart to speak to       Mrs. Martha again, now I myself am reduc'd to my Hanging Sleeves.       The truth is, I have little occasion for a Wife but for the sake of       Modesty, and to lay my Weary Head in Her Lap, if it might be       brought to pass upon Honest Conditions. You know your sisters Age       and Disposition and Circumstances. I should like your advice in my       Fluctuations.\"    The Judge called on Mrs. Martha, probably after learning with precision  her circumstances. \"I showed my willingness to renew my old  acquaintance. She expressed her inability to be serviceable.\" Even after  the Denison and Winthrop fluctuations he was not abashed by refusal, and  he must have been (to quote Mrs. Peachum's words) \"a bitter bad judge 'o  women,\" for he called again and again.         \"She seemed resolved not to move out of the house; made some       Difficulties to accept an Election Sermon lest it should be an       obligation to her. The coach staying long, I made some excuse for       my stay. She said she would be glad to wait on me till midnight       provided I should solicit her no more to that effect.\"    This decision he accepted.    Poor old wife-seeking Judge, with your hanging sleeves, your broken and  drooping wings, feebly did you still flutter around for a resting-place  to \"lay your Weary Head in modesty.\" You fluctuated to a new widow,  Madam Harris, and she gave you \"a nutmeg as it grew,\" ever a true  lover's gift in Shakespeare's day. On January 11th, 1722, this letter  was sent to \"Mrs. Mary Gibbs, widow, at Newton.\"         \"Madam, your removal out of town and the Severity of the Weather       are the Reason of my making you this Epistolary Visit. In times       past (as I remember) you were minded that I should marry you by       giving you to your desirable Bridegroom. Some sense of this       intended Respect abides with me still and puts me upon enquiring       whether you be willing I should marry you now by becoming your       Husband. Aged feeble and exhausted as I am your favourable Answer       to this Enquiry in a few lines, the Candour of it will much oblige,       Madam, your humble serv't Samuel Sewall.\"    This not-too-alluring love-letter brought a favorable answer, for the  Judge assured her she \"writ incomparably well,\" and he accompanied this  praise with a suitable and useful gift, \"A Quire of Paper, a good  Leathern Ink Horn, a stick of Sealing Wax and 200 Wafers in a little  Box.\"    He was even sharper in bargaining with Widow Gibbs than he had been with  other matrimonial candidates. She had no property to leave him by will,  but he astutely stipulated that her children sign a contract that,  should she die before him, they would pay him L100. She thought him  \"hard,\" and so did her sons and her son-in-law, and so he was--hard even  for those times of hard bargains and hard marriage contracts in hard New  England. He would agree to give her but L50 a year in case of his death.  The value of wives had depreciated in his eyes since the L250 a year  Widow Denison. His gifts too were not as rich as those bestowed on that  yearned-for widow. He had seen too many tokens go for naught. Glazed  almonds, Meers cakes, an orange, were good enough for so cheap a  sweetheart. He remained very stiff and peremptory about the marriage  contract, the L100, and wrote her one very unpleasant letter about it;  and he feared lest she being so attached to her children might not be  tender to him \"when there soon would be an end of the old man.\" At last  she yielded to his sharp bargain and they were married. He lived eight  years, so I doubt not Mary was tender to him and mourned him when he  died, hard though he was and wigless withal.    We gather from the pages of Judge Sewall's diary many hints about the  method of conducting other courtships. We discover the Judge craftily  and slyly inquiring whether his daughter Mary's lover-apparent had  previously courted another Boston maid; we see him conferring with lover  Gerrish's father; and after a letter from the latter we see the lover  \"at Super and drank to Mary in the third place.\" He called again when it  was too cold to sit downstairs, and was told he would be \"wellcomm to  come Friday night.\" We read on Saturday:         \"In the evening Sam Gerrish comes not; we expected him; Mary       dress'd herself; it was a painfull disgracefull disapointment.\"    A month later the recreant lover reappeared and finally married poor  disappointed Mary, who died very complaisantly in a short time and left  him free to marry his first love, which he quickly did. We find the  Judge after his daughter's death higgling over her marriage portion with  Mr. Gerrish, Sr., and see that grief for her did not prevent him from  showing as much shrewdness in that matter as he had displayed in his own  courtships.    Timid Betty Sewall was as much harassed in love as in religion. We find  her father, when she was but seventeen years old, making frequent  investigation about the estate of one Captain Tuthill, a prospective  suitor who had visited Betty and \"wished to speak with her.\" The Judge  had his hesitating daughter read aloud to him of the mating of Adam and  Eve, as a soothing and alluring preparation for the thought of  matrimony, with, however, this most unexpected result:         \"At night Capt. Tuthill comes to speak with Betty, who hid herself       all alone in the coach for several hours till he was gone, so that       we sought her at several houses, till at last came in of herself       and look'd very wild.\"    This action of pure maidenly terror elicited sympathy even in the  Judge's match-making heart, and he told the lover he was willing to know  his daughter's mind better. This was on January 10th, 1698. Ten days  later we find wild-eyed Betty going out of her way to avoid drinking  wine with one Captain Turner, much to her father's annoyance. By  September she had refused another suitor.    Her father wrote thus:         \"Got home [from Rhode Island] by seven, in good health, though the       day was hot, find my family in health, only disturbed at Betty's       denying Mr. Hirst, and my wife hath a cold. The Lord sanctify       Mercyes and Afflictions.\"    And again, a month later:         \"Mr. Wm. Hirst comes and thanks my wife and me for our kindness to       his Son, in giving him the liberty of our house. Seems to do it in       the way of taking leave. I thank'd him, and for his countenance to       Hannah at the Wedding. Told him that the well wisher's of my       daughter and his son had persuaded him to go to Brantry and visit       her there, &c.; and said if there were hopes would readily do it.       But as things were twould make persons think he was so involved       that he was not fit to go any wether else. He has I suppose taken       his final leave. I gave him Mr. Oakes Sermon, and my Father Hulls       Funeral Sermon.\"    Two days later, Judge Sewall writes to Betty, who has gone to \"Brantry\"  on a visit.                                                  BOSTON, October 26, 1699.         \"ELIZABETH: Mr. Hirst waits on you once more to see if you can bid       him welcome. It ought to be seriously considered, that your drawing       back from him after all that has passed between you, will be to       your Prejudice; and will tend to discourage persons of worth from       making their Court to you. And you had need well consider whether       you will be able to bear his final leaving of you, howsoever it may       seem grateful to you at present. When persons come toward us we are       apt to look upon their undesirable Circumstances mostly: and       thereupon to shun them. But when persons retire from us for good       and all, we are in danger of looking only on that which is       desirable in them, to our wofull disquiet. Whereas 'tis the       property of a good Ballance to turn where the most weight is,       though there be some also in the other Scale. I do not see but the       match is well liked by judicious persons, and such as are your       Cordial friends, and mine also.         \"Yet notwithstanding, if you find in yourself an unmovable,       incurable Aversion from him and cannot love and honor and obey him,       I shall say no more, nor give you any further trouble in this       matter. It had better off than on. So praying God to pardon us and       pitty our Undeserving, and to direct and strengthen and settle you       in making a right judgment, and giving a right Answer, I take       leave, who am, Dear Child, Your loving father.         \"Your mother remembers to you.\"    Even this very proper and fatherly advice did not have an immediate  effect upon the shy and"]]]
