Ah! Monsieur  Petitbry. Ah!    Nina's unhappy Aunt.        MR. MARESTANG, ATTORNEY At the Law Court of the Seine.    _To Monsieur Henri de B., Literary man in Paris_.    Be calm, be calm, be calm! I forbid your going to Moulins or rushing off  in pursuit of the fugitive. It is more judicious and safer to await her  return in your own house, by your fireside. In point of fact, what has  taken place? You refused to receive that ridiculous and ill-natured old  maid; your wife has gone to join her. You should have expected as much.  Family ties are very strong in the heart of such an extremely youthful  bride. You were in too great a hurry. Remember that this Aunt brought  her up, that she has no other relations in the world. She has her  husband, you will say. Ah! my dear fellow, between ourselves we may  admit that husbands are not always amiable. I know one more especially  who in spite of his good heart is so nervous, so violent! I am well  aware that hard work and artistic preoccupations have a good deal to do  with it. Be that as it may, the bird has been scared, and has flown back  to its former cage. Don't be alarmed, it won't stay there long. Either  I am very much mistaken or the Parisian of yesterday will soon weary of  the antiquated surroundings, and ere long regret the vivacities of her  poet. Above all don't stir.    Your old friend,    Marestang.      _To Monsieur Marestang, attorney in Paris_.    At the same moment with your rational and friendly letter, I received a  telegram from Moulins, announcing Nina's return. Ah! what a true prophet  you were! She is coming back this evening, all alone, just as she left  me, without the slightest advance on my part. The thing now will be to  arrange so easy and agreeable a life for her, that she shall never  again be tempted to leave me. I have laid in a stock of tenderness and  patience during her week's absence. There is only one point on which  I remain inflexible: I will not again receive that horrible _Tata  Bobosse_, that blue stocking of 1820, who gave me her niece only in the  hopes that my modest fame would serve to heighten hers. Remember, my  dear Marestang, that ever since my marriage this wicked little old woman  has always come between my wife and me, pushing her hump into all our  amusements at the theatres, the exhibitions, in society, in the country,  everywhere in fact. And you wonder after that, at my having displayed  a certain haste in getting rid of her, and packing her off to her good  town of Moulins. Indeed, my dear fellow, you have no idea of all the  harm those old maids, suspicious and ignorant of life, are capable of  doing in a young household. This one had stuffed my wife's pretty  little head full of false, old fashioned, preposterous ideas, trumpery  sentimentality of the time of Ipsiboe or young Florange: \"Ah! if my  lady love saw me!\" For her, I was a poate, the poate one sees on the  frontispieces of Renduel or Ladvocat, crowned with laurels, a lyre  on his hips, and his short velvet-collared cloak blown aside by a  Parnassian gust of wind. That was the husband she had promised her  niece, and you may fancy how terribly my poor Nina must have been  disappointed. Nevertheless I admit that I was very bungling with the  dear child. As you say, I wanted to go ahead too rapidly, I frightened  her. It was my part gently to modify all that the rather narrowing and  false education of the convent and the sentimental dreams of the Aunt  had effected, leaving the provincial perfume time to evaporate. However  all this can be repaired since she is returning. She is returning, my  dear friend! This evening, I shall go and meet her at the station and we  shall walk home arm in arm, reconciled and happy.    Henri de B.      _Nina de B. to her Aunt in Moulins_.    He was waiting for me at the station and greeted me with a smile and  open arms, as though I were returning from some ordinary journey. You  can imagine that I put on my iciest appearance. Directly I reached home,  I shut myself up in my room, where I dined alone, pleading fatigue.  After which, I locked myself in. He came to bid me good-night through  the key-hole, and to my great surprise, went away on tiptoe without  anger or importunity. This morning, I called on Monsieur Petitbry, who  gave me detailed instructions as to the way I was to act, the hour,  place, witnesses. Ah! my dear Aunt, if you knew how frightened I am as  the hour draws near.    [Illustration: p121-132]    His violence is so dreadful. Even when he is gentle like yesterday, his  eyes have flashes of lightning. However, I will try and be courageous in  thinking of you, my darling Aunt. Besides, as Monsieur Petitbry said to  me, it is only a short painful moment to get over, and then we will both  resume our former quiet life, so calm and happy.    Nina de B.    [Illustration: p122-134]    [Illustration: p123-134]      _From the same to the same_.    Dear Aunt, I am writing to you from my bed, torn by the emotions of  that terrible scene. Who could have supposed that things would take this  turn? Nevertheless I had taken every precaution. I had warned Marthe and  her sister, who were to come at one o'clock, and I had chosen for the  great scene the moment when on leaving the table, the servants are  clearing away in the dining-room next to the study. From early morn  my plans were laid; an hour of scales and exercises on the piano, the  _Cloches du Monastere_, the _Reveries de Rosellen_, all the pieces  he hates. This did not prevent his working away without betraying the  slightest irritability. At breakfast, the same patience. A detestable  breakfast, scraps, and the sweet dishes he loathes. And if you had seen  my costume! A dress with a cape some five years out of date, a little  black silk apron, and uncurled hair! In vain I sought for some signs  of irritation, that well-known straight line that Monsieur hollows out  between his eyebrows at the least annoyance. Well no! nothing! Really I  might have thought they had changed my husband. He said to me in a calm  and rather sad tone:    \"Ah, you have done your hair in the old way.\"    I hardly answered, not wishing to hurry on matters before my witnesses  had arrived, and then, strangely enough, I felt somewhat moved and upset  beforehand by the scene I was trying to get up. At last, after a few  still shorter replies on my part, he rose from the table and went into  his own room. I followed him trembling. I heard my friends stationing  themselves in the little drawing-room, and Pierre who came and went,  arranging the glasses and silver. The decisive moment had arrived. He  must now be brought to the needful point of violence, and it seemed  to me this would be easy, after all I had done since the morning to  irritate him.    When I entered his study I must have been very pale. I felt myself in  the lion's cage. The thought flashed across me: \"Suppose he killed me!\"  He did not present a very terrible appearance, however, leaning back on  his divan, a cigar in his mouth.    \"Do I disturb you?\" I asked in my most ironical voice.    He replied gently:    \"No. You see. I am not working.\"    Myself, viciously:    \"Ah! indeed you don't work then at all, now?\"    He still very mild.    \"You are mistaken, my dear. On the contrary, I work a great deal. Only  our craft is one in which a great deal of work can be done without  having a tool in hand.\"    \"And what may you be doing at this moment? Ah! yes, I know, your play  in verse; always the same thing for the last two years. It is certainly  lucky that your wife had a fortune! That allows you to idle at your  ease.\"    I thought he would have sprung upon me at this. Not a bit of it. He came  up to me and took hold of my hands gently:    \"Come, is it to be always the same thing? Are we to begin our life of  warfare again? If so, why did you come back?\"    I confess I felt rather moved by his sad and affectionate tone; but  I thought of you, my poor Aunt, of your exile, of his harsh conduct  towards us, and that gave me courage. I said to him the bitterest, most  wounding things I could think of--I know not what--that I wished to  heaven I had never married an artist; that at Moulins, every one pitied  me; that I found my friends married to magistrates, serious, influential  men, in good positions, while he--If even he made money--But no,  Monsieur would work for fame only! and what fame!    [Illustration: p127-138]    At Moulins no one knew him; at Paris, his pieces were hissed. His books  did not sell. And so on, and so on. My brain seemed to whirl round as  all the malicious words came from me one after the other. He looked  at me without replying, in chilly anger. Of course this coldness  exasperated me still more. I was so much excited, that I no longer  recognized my own voice, raised to an extraordinary pitch, and the last  words I screamed at him--I can't remember what unjust and mad remark  it was--seemed to buzz indistinctly in my ears. For a moment, I thought  Monsieur Petitbry's assault with violence was an accomplished fact.  Pallid, with set teeth Henri made two steps towards me:    \"Madame!\"    Then suddenly, his anger fell, his face became impassive again, and  he looked at me with so scornful, insolent and calm a glance, that my  patience came to an end. I raised my hand, and gave him the best box on  the ear I ever gave in my life. At the noise, the door opened, and my  witnesses appeared solemn and indignant.    \"Monsieur! this is infamous!\"    \"Yes, isn't it?\" said the poor fellow, showing his red cheek.    You can imagine my confusion. Happily, I took the line of fainting, and  melting into torrents of tears, which relieved me greatly. At present,  Henri is in my room. He watches by me, nurses me, and is really  most kind. What can I do? What a checkmate!

This condition is especially typical of the Dvina River. The Dvina is a  much larger river than the Vaga and compares favorably to the lower  Mississippi in our own country. It meanders and spreads about over the  surrounding country by a thousand different routes, inasmuch as there  are practically no banks and nothing to hold it within its course. The  Vaga, on the other hand, is a narrower and swifter river and much more  attractive and interesting. It has very few islands and is lined on  either side by comparatively steep bluffs, varying from fifty to one  hundred feet in height. The villages which line the banks are larger and  comparatively more prosperous, but regarding the villages more will be  said later.      [Illustration: Group of soldier surrounding a grave.]  U. S.

This he did at  Seltso. On the morning of September 19th, through mud and water, at  times waist deep and too precarious for hauling artillery, the advance  began on Seltso. At 1:00 p. m. the advance party, \"D\" Company, under  Captain Coleman, reached Yakovlevskaya, a village just north of Seltso  and separated from it by a mile of wide open marsh which is crossed by a  meandering arm of the nearby Dvina. A single road and bridge lead across  to Seltso. \"D\" Company gallantly deployed and wading the swamp  approached within one thousand five hundred yards of the enemy, who  suddenly opened up with machine guns, rifles, and Russian pom pom. This  latter gun is a rapid fire artillery piece, firing a clip of five shells  weighing about one pound apiece, in rapid succession. We later  discovered that they, as well as most of the flimsy rifles, were made by  several of the prominent gun manufacturers of the United States.    \"D\" Company found further advance impossible without support and dug in.  \"C\" Company under Capt. Fitz Simmons hurried up and took position in a  tongue of woods at the right of \"D\" and were joined after dark by \"B\"  Company. None of the officers in command of this movement knew anything  of the geography nor much of anything else regarding this position, so  the men were compelled to dig in as best they could in the mud and water  to await orders from Colonel Corbley, who had not come up. At eleven  o'clock that night a drizzling rain set in, and huddled and crouched  together in this vile morass, unprotected by even an overcoat, without  rations, tired and exhausted from the day's march and fighting, the  battalion bivouacked. All night the enemy kept searching the woods and  marshes with his artillery, but with little effect. During the night we  learned that the Bolo had a land battery of three-inch guns and five  gunboats in the river at their flank with six and nine-inch guns aboard  rafts. This was none too pleasing a situation for an infantry attack  with no artillery preparation, coupled with the miserable condition of  the troops.    As daylight approached the shelling became more and more violent. The  Bolo was sending over everything at his command and it was decided to  continue the attack lest we be exterminated by the enemy artillery. At  daybreak Lt. Dressing of \"B\" Company took out a reconnaissance patrol to  feel out the enemy lines of defense, but owing to the nature of the  ground he had little success. His patrol ran into a Bolo outpost and was  scattered by machine gun fire. It was here that Corporal Shroeder was  lost, no trace ever being found of his body or equipment.    About noon two platoons of Company \"B\" went out to occupy a certain  objective. This they found was a well constructed trench system filled  with Bolos, and flanked by machine gun positions. In the ensuing action  we had three men killed and eight men wounded, including Lt. A. M.  Smith, who received a severe wound in the side, but continued handling  his platoon effectively, showing exceptional fortitude. The battle  continued during the afternoon all along the line. \"C\" and \"D\" were  supporting \"B\" with as much fire as possible. But troops could not stay  where they were under the enemy fire, and Col. Corbley, who had at last  arrived, ordered a frontal attack to come off after a preparatory  barrage by our Russian artillery which had at last toiled up to a  position.    Here fortune favored the Americans. The Russian artillery officer placed  a beautiful barrage upon the village and the enemy gunboats, which  continued from 4:45 to 5:00 p.m. At 5:00 o'clock, the zero hour, the  infantry made the attack and in less than an hour's time they had gained  the village.    The Bolsheviks had been preparing to evacuate anyway, as the persistence  of our attack and effectiveness of our rifle fire had nearly broken  their morale. Americans with white, strained faces, in contrast with  their muck-daubed uniforms, shook hands prayerfully as they discussed  how a determined defense could have murdered them all in making that  frontal attack across a swamp in face of well-set machine gun positions.    However, the Americans were scarcely better off when they had taken  Seltso, for their artillery now could not get up to them. So the enemy  gunboats could shell Seltso at will. Hence it appeared wise to retire  for a few days to Yakovlevskaya. In the early hours of the morning  following the battle the Americans retired from Seltso. They were  exceedingly hungry, dog-tired, sore in spirit, but they had undergone  their baptism of fire.    After a few days spent in Yakovlevskoe we set out again, and advanced as  far as a village called Pouchuga. Here we expected another encounter  with the Bolo, but he had just left when we arrived. We were fallen out  temporarily on a muddy Russian hillside in the middle of the afternoon,  the rain was falling steadily, we had been marching for a week through  the muddiest mud that ever was, the rations were hard tack and bully,  and tobacco had been out for several weeks. A more miserable looking and  feeling outfit can scarce be imagined. A bedraggled looking convoy of  Russian carts under Lt. Warner came up, and he informed us that he could  let us have one package of cigarettes per man. We accepted his offer  without any reluctance, and passed them out. To paraphrase Gunga Din,  says Capt. Boyd:      \"They were British and they stunk as anyone who smoked British issue    cigarettes with forty-two medals can tell you, but of all the smokes    I've (I should say 'smunk' to continue the paraphrase) I'm gratefulest    to those from Lt. Warner. You could see man after man light his    cigarette, take a long draw, and relax in unadulterated enjoyment. Ten    minutes later they were a different outfit, and nowhere as wet, cold,    tired or hungry. Lucy Page Gaston and the Anti-Cigarette League please    note.\"    After a long day's march we finally arrived in a \"suburb\" of Pouchuga  about 7:00 p.m. with orders to place our outposts and remain there that  night. By nine o'clock this was done, and the rest of the company was  scattered in billets all over the village, being so tired that they  flopped in the first place where there was floor space to spread a  blanket. Then came an order to march to the main village and join Major  Corbley. At least a dozen of the men could not get their shoes on by  reason of their feet being swollen, but we finally set out on a pitch  black night through the thick mud. We staggered on, every man falling  full length in the mud innumerable times, and finally reached our  destination. Captain Boyd writes:      \"I shall never forget poor Wilson on that march, cheery and    good-spirited in spite of everything. His loss later at Toulgas was a    personal one as well as the loss of a good soldier.      \"I also remember Babcock on that march--Babcock, who was one of our    best machine gunners, never complaining and always dependable. We were    ploughing along through the mud when from my place at the head of the    column I heard a splash. I went back to investigate and there was    Babcock floundering in a ditch with sides too slippery to crawl up.    The column was marching stolidly past, each man with but one thought,    to pull his foot out of the mud and put it in a little farther on. We    finally got Babcock up to terra firma, he explained that it had looked    like good walking, nice and smooth, and he had gone down to try it. I    cautioned him that he should never try to take a bath while in    military formation, and he seemed to think the advice was sound.\"    Now the battalion was needed over on the Vaga river front, the story of  whose advance there is told in another chapter. By barge the Americans  went down the Dvina to its junction with the Vaga and then proceeded up  that river as far as Shenkursk. To the doughboys this upper Vaga area  seemed a veritable land of milk and honey when compared with the  miserable upper Dvina area. Fresh meat and eggs"]]]
