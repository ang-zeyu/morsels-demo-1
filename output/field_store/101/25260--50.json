And beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many  gleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be the  eyes of great beasts of prey. And he could hear the crashing of their  bodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.  And dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the  fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to  rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his  neck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and the  half-breed cook shouted at him, \"Hey, you Buck, wake up!\" Whereupon the  other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and he  would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.    It was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore  them down. They were short of weight and in poor condition when they  made Dawson, and should have had a ten days' or a week's rest at  least. But in two days' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the  Barracks, loaded with letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the  drivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. This  meant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier pulling  for the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did their  best for the animals.    Each night the dogs were attended to first. They ate before the drivers  ate, and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet of  the dogs he drove. Still, their strength went down. Since the beginning  of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles, dragging sleds  the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life  of the toughest. Buck stood it, keeping his mates up to their work and  maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very tired. Billee cried and  whimpered regularly in his sleep each night. Joe was sourer than ever,  and Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side or other side.    But it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone wrong with  him. He became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at  once made his nest, where his driver fed him. Once out of the harness  and down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the  morning. Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of  the sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. The  driver examined him, but could find nothing. All the drivers became  interested in his case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over their  last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a consultation.  He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded  till he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside, but they could  locate no broken bones, could not make it out.    By the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling  repeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took  him out of the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled.  His intention was to rest Dave, letting him run free behind the sled.  Sick as he was, Dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling  while the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when  he saw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. For the  pride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not  bear that another dog should do his work.    When the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the  beaten trail, attacking Sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him and  trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side, striving  to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled, and all the  while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain. The half-breed  tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no heed to the  stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike harder. Dave  refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where the going was  easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow, where the  going was most difficult, till exhausted. Then he fell, and lay where he  fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.    With the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind  till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the sleds to  his own, where he stood alongside Sol-leks. His driver lingered a moment  to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. Then he returned and  started his dogs. They swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of  exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped in surprise. The  driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. He called his  comrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through both of  Sol-leks's traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in his  proper place.    He pleaded with his eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. His  comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied  the work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where  dogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut  out of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die  anyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So  he was harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more  than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt.  Several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the  sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.    But he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for  him by the fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up  time he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on  his feet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly  toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. He would advance  his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement,  when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more  inches. His strength left him, and the last his mates saw of him he lay  gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could hear him  mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river  timber.    Here the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his  steps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A revolver-shot  rang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped, the bells  tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck knew, and  every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.          Chapter V. The Toil of Trace and Trail      Thirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with Buck  and his mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They were in a wretched  state, worn out and worn down. Buck's one hundred and forty pounds  had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. The rest of his mates, though  lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. Pike, the  malingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often successfully  feigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. Sol-leks was limping,  and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.    They were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them.  Their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling  the fatigue of a day's travel. There was nothing the matter with them  except that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that  comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a  matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the  slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no  power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had  been all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre,  every cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less  than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during  the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days' rest.  When they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs.  They could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just  managed to keep out of the way of the sled.    \"Mush on, poor sore feets,\" the driver encouraged them as they tottered  down the main street of Skaguay. \"Dis is de las'. Den we get one long  res'. Eh? For sure. One bully long res'.\"    The drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they had  covered twelve hundred miles with two days' rest, and in the nature of  reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But so  many were the men who had rushed into the Klondike, and so many were the  sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the congested  mail was taking on Alpine proportions; also, there were official orders.  Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the places of those  worthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be got rid of, and,  since dogs count for little against dollars, they were to be sold.    Three days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how really  tired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two  men from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, for a  song. The men addressed each other as \"Hal\" and \"Charles.\" Charles was  a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a  mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the  limply drooping lip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of nineteen or  twenty, with a big Colt's revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about  him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the  most salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness--a callowness  sheer and unutterable. Both men were manifestly out of place,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Priory Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield (#9)"],[1,"a trefoil heading to each division. There is a  sloping hipped roof to the window, and a broad moulded corbel below it.  The well-known rebus is boldly displayed upon the central of the five  square panels (all sculptured) which adorn the face of this picturesque  chamber (_oriolum_), probably built as a convenient private pew for the  Prior, from which he could survey the whole of the choir and the  Founder's tomb. The Tudor doorway, which now opens into the choir vestry  at the eastern end of the south wall, has the Bolton rebus in the  spandrels of the arch.[3]    #The Clerestory.#--In his reconstruction here Sir Aston Webb has followed  the precedent of the Perpendicular work introduced in the fifteenth  century, which, fortunately, had not been seriously injured in the upper  part of the side walls. He has accordingly adopted that style in the  apse, where the clerestory arcade is entirely new. It displays a series  of five windows of two lights each, with traceried headings, and slender  columns on the inner and outer plane, sufficient to uphold the arcading  without intercepting the light--none too abundant in any part of the  church, though it is entirely destitute of stained glass at the present  day.    The walls of the triforium and clerestory are perforated longitudinally  to form a continuous passage on each side of the choir--interrupted,  however, by the interposition of masonry at the junction of the lateral  walls with the apse.    The passage along the clerestory is formed by a succession of  \"shouldered arches,\" as they are commonly called, though each merely  consists of a flat lintel resting on corbels, which is not strictly an  arch at all. As there are no signs of vaulting-shafts, it may be fairly  assumed that the original roof was a wooden one, probably painted, like  those still in existence at other Norman churches.    The present ceiling, about forty-seven feet above the level of the  floor, is of panelled oak (uncoloured), and supersedes an unsatisfactory  timber structure which had taken the place of the earlier Tudor work. It  was divided into compartments by a tie-beam and king-post at intervals,  supported on corbels representing the heads of cherubim--an innovation  more modern, and even more out of character with the building, than the  ceiling itself. The cross beams from the latter have been retained in  the modern work.    [Illustration: THE FOUNDER'S TOMB                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    #The Founder's Tomb# occupies a bay on the northern side of the  sanctuary. Resting on a simple base of rectangular stones, it consists  of an altar-tomb in the Perpendicular style, ornamented by four  quatrefoil panels in front, each displaying a shield of arms, above  which runs the inscription: _Hic jacet Raherus Primus Canonicus et  Primus Prior hujus Ecclesiae._    [Illustration: THE TOMB OF RAHERE                 _From an old engraving, showing the original extent of                 the arcaded work, and the doorway now removed_                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    The painted effigy of Rahere lies upon its back, vested in the black  Habit of the Augustinian Canons, the hands joined in prayer, and the  tonsured head reposing upon a tasselled cushion. At the feet an angel,  with flowing black hair, and crowned, is represented rising from clouds,  holding towards the recumbent figure a shield, on which the Priory Arms  are embossed and illuminated: _Gules_, two lions _passant guardant: or_,  two ducal coronets in chief.    On each side of the effigy a kneeling monk of the same Order is reading  from a book, opened at Isaiah, li, 3, as may be inferred from the words  distinguishable on the page nearest the spectator, the text obviously  having been chosen with reference to the ground on which the Priory  stands: \"Consolabitur ergo Dominus Sion, et consolabitur omnes ruinas  ejus: et ponat desertum ejus quasi delicias, et solitudinem ejus quasi  hortum Domini.\"    The group is enclosed in a canopied frame of tabernacle work in three  divisions, elaborately carved, with a vaulted ceiling; and each of the  panels in the back wall is perforated with a small decorated window,  unglazed, probably inserted not only for ornament but for the benefit of  pilgrims on the ambulatory side of the shrine. The design is continued  in a fourth panel towards the east, with a blank wall behind it, and  another separating it from the actual tomb. Originally there were two  other panels beyond this, similarly arcaded, and carried over the face  of the adjacent Norman arch, which had a doorway beneath it leading into  the ambulatory (_see_ illustration, p. 46). The canopy and panelling  were added to the tomb in the fifteenth century. It was repaired in the  reign of Henry VIII, and the painting has been more than once renewed,  apparently with some rearrangement of the arms in front, as they do not  appear in the present order in old engravings. Taking them from left to  right they are now those of the City of London, the Priory, England and  France, and Sir Stephen Slaney, Lord Mayor of London in 1595.    The sanctuary is paved with coloured tesserae and marbles, in a series  of five steps, the uppermost of which forms the predella, or footpace,  to the altar. The latter is of oak, and was presented by Miss Overbury,  sister-in-law to the Rev. W. Panckridge, Rector of the Parish from 1884  to 1887.    The somewhat classical design of the pavement is uniform throughout, but  the higher and lower portions are distinguished by separate  inscriptions, one across the chord of the apse, the other along the step  immediately within the railing. These inscriptions are respectively as  follows:        To the Glory of God, and in memory of John Abbiss, 64 years      Rector of this Church, this Apse was rebuilt by his nephew,      Frederick P. Phillips, A.D. 1886. Let Thy priests be clothed      with righteousness.        Where I am, there shall also my servant be.           *       *       *       *       *        In memory of the Rev. Canon F. Parr Phillips, Rector of Stoke      d'Abernon, Surrey, and Patron of this Church. Died 17 March,      1903, aged 84.        Give unto the Lord the glory due unto His Name.      Bring an offering and come before Him.      Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.[4]    [Illustration: THE CHAMBERLAYNE MONUMENT                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    #The Pulpit# is built against a pier on the north side, midway between the  ordinary seats and the choir-stalls. It is a low oblong structure, with  a short flight of steps at each end, and is ornamented in the upper part  with a series of panels, arcaded and perforated to resemble small  windows.    The Hopton Wood stone, or marble, as it is sometimes called, has a  delicate gray vein, which is brought out by polish on the cornice and  balustrade, as a relief to the unpolished surface elsewhere displayed.  There is no inscription; but visitors are usually told about Mrs.  Charlotte Hart, the apparently impecunious pew-opener at the church, who  surprised her friends by dying worth close upon L3,000, and by leaving  L600 to the restoration fund. A new pulpit happened to be wanted at the  time, and the bequest was applied in its erection.    [Illustration: THE SMALPACE MONUMENT                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    On the wall above is the #Monument of Sir Robert Chamberlayne#, an  elegant piece of Jacobean work, deserving a closer examination than can  be bestowed upon it without mounting the pulpit, and even there the  inscription is scarcely legible. The sculpture, which is extremely well  executed, represents Sir Robert kneeling in prayer within a circular  pavilion, the curtains of which are held up by an angel on either side.  The figure wears a partial suit of plate armour over the costume of the  period, and the (bearded) face is turned obliquely towards the east yet  away from the spectator, in the attitude of secret devotion. The tent is  surmounted by a rich cornice, above which the monument terminates in an  ornamental pediment displaying the crest of the deceased. The Latin  inscription beneath relates his descent, through the holders of Sherburn  Castle, Oxon, from the most ancient Tankerville family of Normandy; and  adds that he was knighted by James I, and died between Tripoli and  Cyprus, on a journey to the Holy Sepulchre, at the age of thirty-five,  in the year 1615. The monument was erected by an unknown friend (_amico  amicus_), who concludes with the pious ejaculation _Coelo tegitur qui  non habet urnam_--Heaven covers him who has no sepulchre!    On the south wall, facing this monument, there is another of some  interest and artistic merit. It is to the memory of #Percival Smalpace#  and Agnes his wife, whose boldly sculptured heads are projecting from  separate panels above the tablet containing the inscription. This is  chiefly in Latin, and informs us that the deaths occurred respectively  on 2nd February, 1568, and 3rd September, 1588, in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth, and that Michael and Thomas erected the memorial jointly to  the best of parents.    The moral of the English lines        Behold yourselves by us;        Such once were we as you:      And you in time shall be        Even dust as we are now.    is enforced by a drawing, in outline, representing the nude figures of  the departed lying side by side upon a couch in the sleep of death--no  doubt intended as a _memento mori_ of a less repulsive kind than the  usual desiccated corpse. The monument has been invested with a coating  of black, which at once conceals the whole of the marble (said to be  brown), and shows up the inscription and the figures, both clearly  incised and gilded.    #The Ambulatory#, which encompasses the choir, and is open to it on the  inner side throughout its course, is an interesting part of the original  fabric, and displays to full advantage the characteristic features of  early Norman work--he"]]]
