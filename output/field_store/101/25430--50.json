But however shamefully civilization had treated, and had brought up  children to treat, these and many other of their fellow creatures of the  world, who had a right to the life that had been given them as surely  as it had been given to men, the years since 1820 had been happy ones  for the ancestors of Eve and Petro.    Eve and Petro, themselves, were happy as any two swallows need be that  spring of 1920, when they started forth to seek a cliff, just as their  ancestors had done for the hundred years or so since man began to notice  their habits, and no man knows for how many hundreds of years before  that.    Of course they found it as all cliff swallows must, for cliff-hunting is  a part of their springtime work. It was very high and very straight. Its  wall was of boards, and the gray shingled roof jutted out overhead just  as if inviting Eve and Petro to its shelter.    It was a good cliff, and mankind had been so busy building the same sort  all across the country for the past hundred years that there was no lack  of them anywhere, and swallows could now choose the ones that pleased  them best. Yes, civilization had been kind to them and had made more  cliffs than Nature had built for them; though perhaps it was Mother  Nature, herself, who taught the birds that these structures men called  barns and used inside for hay or cattle were, after all, only cliffs  outside, and that people were harmless creatures who would not hurt the  swallow kind.    However all that may be, it is quite certain that Eve and Petro  squeaked pleasantly for joy when they chose their building site,  undisturbed by the ladder that was soon put near, and unafraid of the  people who climbed up to watch them at their work. They were too happily  busy to worry, and besides, there is a tradition that men folk and  swallow folk are friendly, each to the other.    How old this tradition is, we do not know; but we do know that swallows  of one kind and another were welcomed in the Old World in the old days  to heathen temples before there were Christian churches, and that to-day  in the New World they play in and out of the dark arches in the great  churches of far Brazil and flash across the gilding of the very  tabernacle, reminding us of the passage in the Psalms where it is  written that the swallow hath found a nest for herself, where she may  lay her young--even thine altars, O Lord of Hosts!    So it is not strange that far and wide over the world people have the  idea that swallows bring luck to the house. I think so myself, don't  you?--that it is very good fortune, indeed, to have these birds of  friendly and confiding ways beneath our shelter.    Of course the ancestors of cliff swallows had not known the walls and  roofs of man so long as other kinds of swallows; but the associations of  one short century had been pleasant enough to call forth many cheerful  squeakings of joy, just like those of Eve and Petro that pleasant day  in June when they started their nest under the roof near the top of the  ladder.    To be sure, they made no use of that ladder, even though they were  masons and had their hods of plaster to carry way up near the top of  their cliff. No, they needed no firmer ladder than the air, and their  long wings were strong enough to climb it with.    They lost little time in beginning, each coming with his first hod of  plaster. How? Balanced on their heads as some people carry burdens? No.  On their backs, then? No. In their claws? Oh, no, their feet were far  too feeble for bearing loads. Do you remember what Corbie used for a  berry-pail when he went out to pick fruit? Why, of course! the hod of  the swallow mason is none other than his mouth, and it holds as much as  half a thimbleful.    First, Eve had to mark the place where the curved edge of the nest would  be; and how could she mark it without any chalk, and how could she make  a curve without any compasses? Well, she clung to the straight wall with  her little feet, which she kept nearly in one place, and, swinging her  body about, hitch by hitch, she struck out her curve with her beak and  marked it with little dabs of plaster. Then she and Petro could tell  where to build and, taking turns, first one and then the other, they  began to lay the wall of their home.    It was slow work, for it must be thick and strong, and the place where  they gathered the plaster was not handy by, and it took a great great  many trips, their hods being so small.    At first, while the nest was shallow, only one could work at a time; and  if Petro came back with his plaster before Eve had patted the last of  hers into place, she would squeak at him in a fidgety though not fretful  voice, as if saying, \"Now, don't get in my way and bother me, dear.\" So  he would have to fly about while he waited for her to go. The minute she  was ready to be off, he would be slipping into her place; and this time  she would give him a cosy little squeak of welcome, and he would reply,  with his mouth full of plaster, in a quick and friendly way, as if he  meant, \"I'll build while you fetch more plaster, and we'd both better  hurry, don't you think?\"    After worrying a bit about the best place to dump his hodful, he went to  work. He opened his beak and, in the most matter-of-fact way, pushed out  his lump of plaster with his tongue, on top of the nest wall. Then he  braced his body firmly in the nest and began to use his trowel, which  was his upper beak, pushing the fresh lump all smooth on the inside of  the nest.    Have you ever seen a dog poke with the top of his nose, until he got the  dirt heaped over a bone which he had buried? Well, that's much the way  Petro bunted his plaster smooth--rooted it into place with the top of  his closed beak. He got his face dirty doing it, too, even the pretty  pale feather crescent moon on his forehead. But that didn't matter.  Trowels, if they do useful work, have to get dirty doing it, and Petro  didn't stop because of that. If he had, his nest would have been as  rough on the inside as it was outside, where a humpy little lump showed  for each mouthful of plaster.    Although Eve and Petro did not fly off to the plaster pit together, they  did not go alone, for there was a whole colony of swallows building  under the eaves of that same barn; and while some of them stayed and  plastered, the rest flew forth for a fresh supply.    They knew the place, every one of them; and swiftly over the meadow and  over the marsh they flew, until they came to a pasture. There, near a  spring where the cows had trampled the ground until it was oozy and the  water stood in tiny pools in their hoof prints, the swallows stopped.  They put down their beaks into the mud and gathered it in their mouths;  and all the time they held their wings quivering up over their beautiful  blue backs, like a flock of butterflies just alighting with their wings  atremble.    So their plaster pit was just a mud-puddle. Yes, that is all; only it  had to be a particularly sticky kind of mud, which is called clay; for  the walls of their homes were a sort of brick something like that the  people made in Egypt years and years ago. And do you remember how the  story goes that the folk in Pharaoh's day gathered straws to mix with  the clay, so that their bricks would be stronger? Well, Eve and Petro  didn't know that story, but they gathered fibres of slender roots and  dead grass stems with their clay, which doubtless did their brick  plaster no harm.    [Illustration: _At Work in the Plaster Pit._]    Men brick-makers nowadays bake their bricks in ovens called kilns,  which are heated with fire. Eve and Petro let their brick bake, too, and  the fire they used was the same one the Egyptians used in the days of  Pharaoh--a fire that had never in all that time gone out, but had glowed  steadily century after century, baking many bricks for folk and birds.  Of course you know what fire that is, for you see it yourself every day  that the sun shines.    Every now and again Eve and Petro and all the rest of the swallow colony  left off their brick-building and went on a hunting trip. They hunted  high in the air and they hunted low over the meadow. They hunted afar  off along the stream and they hunted near by in the barnyard. And all  the game they caught they captured on the wing, and they ate it fresh at  a gulp without pausing in their flight. As they sailed and swirled, they  were good to watch, for a swallow's strong long wings bear him right  gracefully.    Why did they stop for the hunting flight? Perhaps they were hungry.  Perhaps their mouths were tired of being hods for clay they could not  eat. Perhaps the fresh plaster on the walls of their homes needed time  to dry a bit before more was added.    Be that as it may, they made the minutes count even while they rested  from their building work. For they used this time getting their meals;  and whenever they were doing that, they were working for the owner of  the barn, paying their rent for the house-lot on the wall by catching  grass insects over the meadow, and mosquitoes and horseflies and  house-flies by the hundreds, and many another pest, too.    [Illustration: _The Hunting Flight._]    Ah, yes, there may be some reason for the belief that swallows bring  good luck to men. I once heard of a farmer who said he didn't dare  disturb these birds because of a superstition that, if he did, his cows  wouldn't give so much milk. Well, maybe they wouldn't if all the flies  a colony of swallows could catch were alive to pester his herd; for the  happier and more comfortable these animals are, the healthier they are  and the more milk they give.    The hunting flights of Eve and Petro and their comrades lasted about  fifteen minutes each time they took a recess from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2562"],[0,"The Clouds (#9)"],[1,"     Pas. I will depart; and be assured of this, that I will       make deposit against you, or may I live no longer!         Strep. Then you will lose it besides, in addition to       your twelve minae. And yet I do not wish you to suffer       this, because you named the kardopos foolishly.         [Exeunt Pasias and Witness, and enter Amynias]         Amynias. Ah me! Ah me!         Strep. Ha! Whoever is this, who is lamenting? Surely it       was not one of Carcinus' deities  that spoke.         Amyn. But why do you wish to know this, who I am?-A       miserable man.         Strep. Then follow your own path.         Amyn. O harsh fortune! O Fates, breaking the wheels of       my horses! O Pallas, how you have destroyed me!         Strep. What evil, pray, has Tlepolemus  ever done you?         Amyn. Do not jeer me, my friend; but order your son to       pay me the money which he received; especially as I have       been unfortunate.         Strep. What money is this?         Amyn. That which he borrowed.         Strep. Then you were really unlucky, as I think.         Amyn. By the gods, I fell while driving my horses.         Strep. Why, pray, do you talk nonsense, as if you had       fallen from an ass?         Amyn. Do I talk nonsense if I wish to recover my money?         Strep. You can't be in your senses yourself.         Amyn. Why, pray?         Strep. You appear to me to have had your brains shaken       as it were.         Amyn. And you appear to me, by Hermes, to be going to be       summoned, if you will not pay me the money?         Strep. Tell me now, whether you think that Jupiter       always rains fresh rain on each occasion, or that the       sun draws from below the same water back again?         Amyn. I know not which; nor do I care.         Strep. How then is it just that you should recover your       money, if you know nothing of meteorological matters?         Amyn. Well, if you are in want, pay me the interest of       my money.         Strep. What sort of animal is this interest?         Amyn. Most assuredly the money is always becoming more       and more every month and every day as the time slips       away.         Strep. You say well. What then? Is it possible that you       consider the sea to be greater now than formerly?         Amyn. No, by Jupiter, but equal; for it is not fitting       that it should be greater.         Strep. And how then, you wretch does this become no way       greater, though the rivers flow into it, while you seek       to increase your money? Will you not take yourself off       from my house? Bring me the goad.         [Enter Servant with a goad.]          Amyn. I call you to witness these things.         Strep. (beating him). Go! Why do you delay? Won't you       march, Mr. Blood-horse?         Amyn. Is not this an insult, pray?         Strep. Will you move quickly?          [Pricks him behind with the goad.]         I'll lay on you, goading you behind, you outrigger? Do       you fly?         [Amynias runs off.]         I thought I should stir you, together with your wheels       and your two-horse chariots.         [Exit Strepsiades.]         Cho. What a thing it is to love evil courses! For this       old man, having loved them, wishes to withhold the money       that he borrowed. And he will certainly meet with       something today, which will perhaps cause this sophist       to suddenly receive some misfortune, in return for the       knaveries he has begun. For I think that he will       presently find what has been long boiling up, that his       son is skilful to speak opinions opposed to justice, so       as to overcome all with whomsoever he holds converse,       even if he advance most villainous doctrines; and       perhaps, perhaps his father will wish that he were even       speechless.         Strep. (running out of the house pursued by his son)       Hollo! Hollo! O neighbours, and kinsfolk, and       fellow-tribesmen, defend me, by all means, who am being       beaten! Ah me, unhappy man, for my head and jaw! Wretch!       Do you beat your father?         Phid. Yes, father.         Strep. You see him owning that he beats me.         Phid. Certainly.         Strep. O wretch, and parricide, and house-breaker!         Phid. Say the same things of me again, and more. Do you       know that I take pleasure in being much abused?         Strep. You blackguard!         Phid. Sprinkle me with roses in abundance.         Strep. Do you beat your father?         Phid. And will prove too, by Jupiter! that I beat you       with justice.         Strep. O thou most rascally! Why, how can it be just to       beat a father?         Phid. I will demonstrate it, and will overcome you in       argument.         Strep. Will you overcome me in this?         Phid. Yea, by much and easily. But choose which of the       two Causes you wish to speak.         Strep. Of what two Causes?         Phid. The better, or the worse?         Strep. Marry, I did get you taught to speak against       justice, by Jupiter, my friend, if you are going to       persuade me of this, that it is just and honourable for       a father to be beaten by his sons!         Phid. I think I shall certainly persuade you; so that,       when you have heard, not even you yourself will say       anything against it.         Strep. Well, now, I am willing to hear what you have to       say.         Cho. It is your business, old man, to consider in what       way you shall conquer the man; for if he were not       relying upon something, he would not be so licentious.       But he is emboldened by something; the boldness of the       man is evident. Now you ought to tell to the Chorus from       what the contention first arose. And this you must do by       all means.         Strep. Well, now, I will tell you from what we first       began to rail at one another. After we had feasted, as       you know, I first bade him take a lyre, and sing a song       of Simonides, \"The Shearing of the Ram.\"  But he       immediately said it was old-fashioned to play on the       lyre and sing while drinking, like a woman grinding       parched barley.         Phid. For ought you not then immediately to be beaten       and trampled on, bidding me sing, just as if you were       entertaining cicadae?         Strep. He expressed, however, such opinions then too       within, as he does now; and he asserted that Simonides       was a bad poet. I bore it at first, with difficulty       indeed, yet nevertheless I bore it. And then I bade him       at least take a myrtle-wreath and recite to me some       portion of Aeschylus; and then he immediately said,       \"Shall I consider Aeschylus the first among the poets,       full of empty sound, unpolished, bombastic, using rugged       words?\" And hereupon you can't think how my heart       panted. But, nevertheless, I restrained my passion, and       said, \"At least recite some passage of the more modern       poets, of whatever kind these clever things be.\" And he       immediately sang a passage of Euripides, how a brother,       O averter of ill! Debauched his uterine sister. And I       bore it no longer, but immediately assailed him with       many abusive reproaches. And then, after that, as was       natural, we hurled word upon word. Then he springs upon       me; and then he was wounding me, and beating me, and       throttling me.         Phid. Were you not therefore justly beaten, who do not       praise Euripides, the wisest of poets?         Strep. He the wisest! Oh, what shall I call you? But I       shall be beaten again.         Phid. Yes, by Jupiter, with justice?         Strep. Why, how with justice? Who, O shameless fellow,       reared you, understanding all your wishes, when you       lisped what you meant? If you said bryn, I,       understanding it, used to give you to drink. And when       you asked for mamman, I used to come to you with bread.       And you used no sooner to say caccan, than I used to       take and carry you out of doors, and hold you before me.       But you now, throttling me who was bawling and crying       out because I wanted to ease myself, had not the heart       to carry me forth out of doors, you wretch; but I did it       there while I was being throttled.         Cho. I fancy the hearts of the youths are panting to       hear what he will say. For if, after having done such       things, he shall persuade him by speaking, I would not       take the hide of the old folks, even at the price of a       chick-pea. It is thy business, thou author and upheaver       of new words, to seek some means of persuasion, so that       you shall seem to speak justly.         Phid. How pleasant it is to be acquainted with new and       clever things, and to be able to despise the established       laws! For I, when I applied my mind to horsemanship       alone, used not to be able to utter three words before I       made a mistake; but now, since he himself has made me       cease from these pursuits, and I am acquainted with       subtle thoughts, and arguments, and speculations, I       think I shall demonstrate that it is just to chastise       one's father.         Strep. Ride, then, by Jupiter! Since it is better for me       to keep a team of four horses than to be killed with a       beating.         Phid. I will pass over to that part of my discourse       where you interrupted me; and first I will ask you this:       Did you beat me when I was a boy?         Strep. I did, through good-will and concern for you.         Phid. Pray tell me, is it not just that I also should be       well inclined toward you in the same way, and beat you,       since this is to be well inclined-to give a beating? For       why ought your body to be exempt from blows and mine       not? And yet I too was born free. The boys weep, and do       you not think it is right that a father should weep? You       will say that it is ordained by "]]]
