Fig. 173 shows the tenoning of a wide to a narrow rail when the  joint is at an angle.    INSERTED TENONS (Fig. 174).--Where two pieces of timber run together at  an acute angle it becomes necessary to use inserted tenons. Both pieces  of the timber are mortised and the inserted tenons are secured into the  widest piece. On the left is shown the inserted tenon, secured by the  method known as fox-wedging; on the right the inserted tenon has been let  into the wide rail from the edge. The narrow rail is secured by wedging  the tenons from the outside edge in the ordinary manner.    [Illustration: Fig. 170.--Open-Slot Mortise at 60 degrees.]    [Illustration: Fig. 171.--Hammer-Head Tenon Joint.]    DREADNOUGHT FILE.--At Fig. 175 is a sketch of a portion of a dreadnought  file. This has superseded the old-fashioned home-made float used to clean  out the sides of a mortise.    [Illustration: Fig. 172.--Clamping.]    [Illustration: Fig. 173.--Tenoning Narrow Rail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 174.--Inserted Tenons.]    [Illustration: Fig. 175.--Dreadnought File.]    [Illustration: Fig. 176.--External and Internal Joints.]    [Illustration: Fig. 177.--Setting out Stiles and Rails for Tenoning.]    GENERAL RULE.--In practically all cases where a single tenon is used the  thickness of the tenon should be one-third the thickness of the timber.  This leaves the timber at each side of the mortise the same strength as  the tenon.    Mortise and tenon joints for inside work may be united with glue. If,  however, the work has to stand the weather a better method is to unite  the joint with white lead, which is run down to the required consistency  with good outside varnish.    SETTING OUT THE JOINT.--The principal use of the mortise and tenon joint  is in the construction of various types of framing, such as door and  window frames. In one or other of its many and varied forms it may be  classed as the most important joint in the general woodworking trade. The  joint may be used as an internal one, as shown at the lower rail, Fig.  176, or as an external joint, as the upper rail of the same illustration.    Whatever type of framing has to be made, it is necessary that the face  side of the wood be planed up straight and out of winding, and the face  mark (as shown in Fig. 176) pencilled upon it. The best edge of the  timber should next be planed up true in length, and square to the face  side, and the edge mark (X) clearly placed upon it.    The marking gauge is now set to the desired width, and gauge lines are  marked on the wood, after which the waste wood is planed off until the  timber is the required width. The thickness is gauged and treated in a  similar manner, except in such cases where the finished work is to be of  a rough and ready character.    THE TWO STILES (or uprights) have their faces turned to touch each other,  as shown at Fig. 177, and their length may be anything from 1 in. to 3  ins. longer than the required finished size. This waste wood at each end  of the stiles (see arrow HO) is of importance to the work, as it prevents  to a great extent the bursting of the mortise whilst cutting the hole or  when knocking together the work. The small projection is called the  \"horn,\" and it is cut off after the frame has been put together.    [Illustration: Fig. 178.--Setting Out the Stiles with Marking Knife.]    [Illustration: Fig. 179.--How to Saw the Tenons--First Operation.]    THE TWO CROSS RAILS (Fig. 177), have their faces placed together as shown  in the sketch. These rails may with advantage be left 1/2 in. longer than  the finished size, and the portion of the tenon (which will protrude  through the stile 1/4 in. at each end) may be cut off after the work is  put together. (See Fig. 92.)    Set out the stiles with a marking knife or penknife and a try square, as  shown at Fig. 178. In this sketch only one stile is shown for clearness  of representation, but two or more stiles (as at Fig. 177) may be marked  out at the same time, provided a 12-in. try square be used; in fact,  marking out the stiles in pairs is to be recommended, as all cross lines  will be exact owing to their being marked at the same operation. The cut  made by the marking knife should be lightly carried all round the work as  the mortising is cut from each edge of the stile, the cutting of the  mortising being finished in the centre. The lettering on Fig. 177 is as  follows:--HO, horn; M, position of mortise; H, position of haunching; A,  inside line, or sight size, as it is occasionally called.    Set out the cross rails as at Fig. 177, lower sketch. The lettering in  this figure is as follows:--T, tenons; the small piece of the tenon  lettered J is called the haunch, and the shaded portion H is cut away to  allow the haunch J to fit the haunching of the stile.    THE TENONS (as already stated) are generally one-third the thickness of  the timber, thus leaving the same amount of substance at each side of the  tenon as the tenon itself is composed of. The mortise gauge is set to the  required distance and used as in the case of the marking gauge (Fig.  82).    [Illustration: Fig. 180.--Second Operation in Sawing Tenons.]    [Illustration: Fig. 181.--Cutting Channel at Shoulder of Tenon before  Sawing.]    To saw the tenons, place the rail in the vice as at Fig. 179 and, with a  panel, tenon, or hand saw, according to the size of the work, cut down  the outside of the tenon line as shown. Reverse your position and cut as  shown at Fig. 180, then place the rail in a vertical position, and you  will find little or no difficulty in sawing down square with the shoulder  line. Repeat the above methods of sawing until all the tenons are sawn.    Next saw out the pieces at the side of the tenon by the following  procedure. Place the rail against the bench stop, or in the vice, and cut  a small channel in which to run your tenon saw as shown at Fig. 181. If  you have scored the line deeply with your knife when you were marking out  the work, you will have little difficulty in removing a small portion  with the chisel. The amount removed in the illustration is, of course,  exaggerated. In the small channel thus made place the tenon saw and,  guiding the saw blade with the finger so as to keep it upright or square  (Fig. 182), saw away the waste material. Remove the waste material at the  sides of the tenons in a similar way, and then saw out the portion marked  H, Fig. 177, lower sketch.    THE MORTISING of the stiles may next be taken in hand by putting the  stiles edgeways in the vice and boring away the bulk of the waste wood  from the mortise with a suitable-sized twist bit and brace. This method  will save a great amount of noise, as to a great extent it does away with  the use of the mallet. Take the mallet and chisel and chop down about 3/8  in. as shown at Fig. 183; then turn the chisel to the position shown at  Fig. 184 and remove the small piece as shown. Continue these two  operations until you are about half-way through the wood and then start  in a similar manner at the line _a_, Fig. 183, after which turn the other  edge of the timber uppermost and repeat the methods shown.    [Illustration: Fig. 182.--Sawing away Waste Material.]    [Illustration: Fig. 183.--Using the Chisel and Mallet for Mortising.]    Fig. 185 shows the sketch of a mortise which has its side removed so as  to show the method of successive cuts with a chisel when removing the  core from a mortise; this, in conjunction with the other sketches,  clearly shows the methods of working. In many woodwork examinations the  examiners insist that the mortise shall be removed by successive cuts  with the chisel, but we certainly advise the removal of much of the waste  wood with a boring bit, provided the worker can keep straight and well  within the limitations of his gauge lines.    [Illustration: Fig. 184.--Removing Waste of Mortise with Chisel.]    REMOVING HAUNCHING.--After removing the mortise hole, the small portion  which is called the haunching will require to be removed with a chisel.  This calls for no special remark, as it is clearly shown in Figs. 187 and  188. Fig. 186 shows an everyday type of mortise and tenon joint  separated; it is used in cases where a straight joint is required on the  upper or lower edge of the work, whereas the upper rail of Fig. 176 shows  the full haunch on the top edge. In cases such as Figs 187 and 188, where  the edges of the frames are grooved to receive panels, etc., the width of  the tenon is reduced by the width of the groove.    [Illustration: Fig. 185.--Mortise with Side Removed.]    [Illustration: Fig. 186.--The Joint Separated.]    [Illustration: Fig. 187.--Removal of Haunching.]    [Illustration: Fig. 188.--Haunching with Groove above.]    This must be remembered by the worker when marking out his stiles with  the marking knife. Fig. 187 (right-hand sketch) shows the haunch, tenon,  and groove G at the bottom. Fig. 188 (left-hand illustration) shows G  (groove) at top, and HH (the haunch) at the bottom. Tenons may be glued  together and wedged as shown at Fig. 176 if for inside work; but if for  outside work they are generally smeared with thick paint and wedged up.  For light-class cabinet work it is usual to cut the mortise about  seven-eighths of the distance through the stile and make the tenon to  match it; the edge of the finished work does not then show any indication  of the joint, and it leaves a nice clean surface at the edge of the work  for polishing or varnishing.
