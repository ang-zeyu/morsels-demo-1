At length the keeper was  awakened by some of the attendants, and he did not appear in the least  worried by the situation in which he found himself, but shook the lion  by the paw, and then gently conducted him to his old cage.    [Illustration]          LXV    A USURPER PUNISHED      Some years ago a sparrow had early in the spring taken possession of a  swallow's old nest, and had laid some eggs in it, when the original  builder and owner made her appearance and claimed possession. The  sparrow, firmly seated, refused to leave the nest. A smart battle  followed, in which the swallow was joined by its mate, and, during the  conflict, by several of their comrades. All the efforts of the swallows  to drive out the usurper were, however, unsuccessful. Finding themselves  completely foiled in this object, they held a council of war to consult  as to what they should do, and the plan they agreed upon shows that it  was with no ordinary degree of ingenuity that they had solved the  question as to what was right and just. Since the sparrow could not be  driven out of the nest, the next question with them appears to have  been, how she could be otherwise punished for her unlawful occupation of  a property belonging to another. The council were of one mind in  thinking that nothing short of the death of the intruder could atone for  so heinous an offense; and having so decided, they went to work to put  their sentence into execution in the following very wonderful manner.  Leaving the scene of the contest for a time, they returned with many  more friends, each bearing a beak full of building materials; and  without any further attempt to beat out the sparrow, they at once set to  work to build up the entrance into the nest, and soon had enclosed the  sparrow within the clay tenement, thus leaving the poor bird to perish  in the stronghold she had so bravely defended.    [Illustration]          LXVI    STRANGE ROOKS      In a large north of England town a pair of strange rooks, after trying  in vain to find a home in a rookery at a little distance from the  Exchange, gave up the attempt, and took refuge on the spire of a  building; and although constantly bothered by other rooks, they built  their nest on the top of the vane, and there reared a brood of young  ones, undisturbed by the noise of the people below them. The nest and  its inmates were, of course, turned about by every change of the wind.  For ten years they continued to build their nest in the same place, soon  after which the spire was taken down.    [Illustration]          LXVII    TAME HARES      The hare is scarcely a domestic animal; yet we have an account of one  that was so tame as to feed from the hand, lie under a chair in the  sitting-room, and appear in every way as easy and comfortable as a  lapdog. It now and then went out into the garden, but, after hopping  about in the fresh air for a while, it always returned to the house. Its  usual companions were a greyhound and a spaniel, with whom it spent its  evenings, the whole three playing and sleeping together on the same  hearth. What makes the circumstance more remarkable is, that the  greyhound and spaniel were both so fond of hare-hunting, that they used  often to go out coursing together, without anybody with them. They were  like the \"Sly Couple,\" of whose devotion to the chase an amusing story  is told.    A traveller once brought a young hare to such a degree of frolicsome  familiarity, that it would run and jump about his sofa and bed; leap  upon and pat him with its fore feet; or while he was reading, it would  sometimes knock the book out of his hands, as if to claim, like a  fondled child, his exclusive attention.    [Illustration]          LXVIII    THE PIG POINTER      A sow, which was a thin, long-legged animal, when young took such a  fancy to some pointer puppies that a gamekeeper on a neighboring estate  was breaking, that it played, and often came to feed with them. This led  the gamekeeper, who had broken many a dog as obstinate as a pig, to  think he might also manage to break a pig.    The little animal would often go out with the puppies to some distance  from home; and he coaxed it farther by a sort of pudding made of barley  meal, which he carried in one of his pockets. The other pocket he filled  with stones, which he threw at the pig whenever she misbehaved.    He found the animal tractable, and soon taught her what he wished by  this mode of reward and punishment. They were frequently seen out  together, when the sow quartered her ground as regularly as any pointer,  stood when she came on game (having an excellent nose), and backed other  dogs as well as ever a pointer did. When she came on the cold scent of  game, she slackened her trot, and gradually dropped her ears and tail;  till she was certain, and then fell down on her knees. So staunch was  she, that she would frequently remain for five minutes and upwards on  her point. As soon as the game rose, she always returned to her master,  grunting very loud, for her reward of pudding, if it was not at once  given to her.    [Illustration]          LXIX    A WISE OURANG-OUTANG      A well-known traveller tells a story about the ourang-outang in its wild  state, which shows that it has both a good memory and some ingenuity.    When the fruits on the mountains are gone, these animals often go down  to the seacoast, where they feed upon various kinds of shell-fish, but  in particular on a large sort of oyster, which commonly lies open on the  shore. \"Fearful,\" he says, \"of putting in their paws, lest the oyster  should close and crush them, they insert a stone as a wedge within the  shell. This prevents it from closing, and they then drag out their prey,  and devour it at leisure.\"    [Illustration]          LXX    A GRACEFUL RETURN      A favorite house-dog, left to the care of its master's servants, while  he was himself away, would have been starved by them if it had not found  a friend in the kitchen of a friend of its master's, which in better  days it had occasionally visited. On the return of the master it had  plenty at home, and had no further need of food; but still it did not  forget the place where it had found a friend in need. A few days after,  the dog fell in with a duck, which, as he found in no private pond, he  no doubt decided was no private property. He snatched up the duck in his  teeth, carried it to the kitchen where he had been so generously fed,  laid it at the cook's feet, with many polite movements of his tail, and  then scampered off with much seeming joy at having given this real proof  of his gratitude.    [Illustration]          LXXI    WRENS LEARNING TO SING      A wren built her nest in a box, so placed that a family had a chance to  watch the mother bird teaching her young ones the art of singing  peculiar to wrens. She fixed herself on one side of the opening in the  box, directly before the young birds, and began singing over her whole  song very distinctly. One of the little birds then tried to imitate her.  After singing through a few notes, its voice broke and it lost the tune.  The mother at once began again where the young one had failed, and went  very distinctly through the rest of the song. The young bird made a  second attempt, beginning where it had stopped before, and kept up the  song as long as it was able. If the note was lost again, the mother  began anew where it stopped, and finished it. Then the little one  resumed the song and finished it.    This done, the mother sang over the whole series of notes a second time  with great care, and a second of the young ones tried to follow her. The  wren followed the same course with this one as with the first; and so on  with the third and all the rest. It sometimes happened that the young  bird would lose the tune three or four or more times in the same  attempt, and the mother would always begin where they stopped and sing  the rest of the song; and when each little bird had sung the whole song  through, she repeated the whole strain. Sometimes two of the young  birds began together. The mother did just the same as when one sang  alone. This practise was repeated day after day, and several times a  day.    [Illustration]          LXXII    RARE HONESTY      A mastiff dog, who owed more to the kindness of a neighbor than to his  master, was once locked by mistake in the well-stored pantry of his  benefactor for a whole day, where there were, within his reach, milk,  butter, bread and meat, in abundance. On the return of the servant to  the pantry, seeing the dog come out, and knowing the time it had been  shut in there, she trembled for fear of the waste which she was sure her  carelessness must have brought about; but on close examination, it was  found that the honest creature had not tasted of anything, although, on  coming out, he fell on a bone that was given him, with all the  greediness of hunger.    [Illustration]          LXXIII    DIVISION OF LABOR      The Alpine marmots are said to work together in the collection of  materials for the building of their homes. Some of them, we are told,  cut the herbage, others collect it into heaps; a third set serve as  wagons to carry it to their holes; while still others perform all the  work of draught horses. The manner of the latter part of the curious  process is this. The animal that is to be the wagon, lies down on its  back, and stretching out its four legs as wide as it can, allows itself  to be loaded with hay; and those that are to be the horses, drag it,  thus loaded, by the tail, taking care not to upset the creature. The  task of thus serving as a wagon being, evidently, the least desirable  part of the business, is taken by every one of the party in turn.    [Illustrati"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25447"],[0,"Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays (#9)"],[1,"has invented a method, a thousand lesser men can  apply it. No transcendent ability is required in order to make useful  discoveries in science; the edifice of science needs its masons,  bricklayers, and common labourers as well as its foremen,  master-builders, and architects. In art nothing worth doing can be  done without genius; in science even a very moderate capacity can  contribute to a supreme achievement.    In science the man of real genius is the man who invents a new method.  The notable discoveries are often made by his successors, who can  apply the method with fresh vigour, unimpaired by the previous labour  of perfecting it; but the mental calibre of the thought required for  their work, however brilliant, is not so great as that required by the  first inventor of the method. There are in science immense numbers of  different methods, appropriate to different classes of problems; but  over and above them all, there is something not easily definable,  which may be called _the_ method of science. It was formerly customary  to identify this with the inductive method, and to associate it with  the name of Bacon. But the true inductive method was not discovered by  Bacon, and the true method of science is something which includes  deduction as much as induction, logic and mathematics as much as  botany and geology. I shall not attempt the difficult task of stating  what the scientific method is, but I will try to indicate the temper  of mind out of which the scientific method grows, which is the second  of the two merits that were mentioned above as belonging to a  scientific education.    The kernel of the scientific outlook is a thing so simple, so obvious,  so seemingly trivial, that the mention of it may almost excite  derision. The kernel of the scientific outlook is the refusal to  regard our own desires, tastes, and interests as affording a key to  the understanding of the world. Stated thus baldly, this may seem no  more than a trite truism. But to remember it consistently in matters  arousing our passionate partisanship is by no means easy, especially  where the available evidence is uncertain and inconclusive. A few  illustrations will make this clear.    Aristotle, I understand, considered that the stars must move in  circles because the circle is the most perfect curve. In the absence  of evidence to the contrary, he allowed himself to decide a question  of fact by an appeal to æsthetico-moral considerations. In such a case  it is at once obvious to us that this appeal was unjustifiable. We  know now how to ascertain as a fact the way in which the heavenly  bodies move, and we know that they do not move in circles, or even in  accurate ellipses, or in any other kind of simply describable curve.  This may be painful to a certain hankering after simplicity of pattern  in the universe, but we know that in astronomy such feelings are  irrelevant. Easy as this knowledge seems now, we owe it to the courage  and insight of the first inventors of scientific method, and more  especially of Galileo.    We may take as another illustration Malthus's doctrine of population.  This illustration is all the better for the fact that his actual  doctrine is now known to be largely erroneous. It is not his  conclusions that are valuable, but the temper and method of his  inquiry. As everyone knows, it was to him that Darwin owed an  essential part of his theory of natural selection, and this was only  possible because Malthus's outlook was truly scientific. His great  merit lies in considering man not as the object of praise or blame,  but as a part of nature, a thing with a certain characteristic  behaviour from which certain consequences must follow. If the  behaviour is not quite what Malthus supposed, if the consequences are  not quite what he inferred, that may falsify his conclusions, but does  not impair the value of his method. The objections which were made  when his doctrine was new--that it was horrible and depressing, that  people ought not to act as he said they did, and so on--were all such  as implied an unscientific attitude of mind; as against all of them,  his calm determination to treat man as a natural phenomenon marks an  important advance over the reformers of the eighteenth century and the  Revolution.    Under the influence of Darwinism the scientific attitude towards man  has now become fairly common, and is to some people quite natural,  though to most it is still a difficult and artificial intellectual  contortion. There is however, one study which is as yet almost wholly  untouched by the scientific spirit--I mean the study of philosophy.  Philosophers and the public imagine that the scientific spirit must  pervade pages that bristle with allusions to ions, germ-plasms, and  the eyes of shell-fish. But as the devil can quote Scripture, so the  philosopher can quote science. The scientific spirit is not an affair  of quotation, of externally acquired information, any more than  manners are an affair of the etiquette-book. The scientific attitude  of mind involves a sweeping away of all other desires in the interests  of the desire to know--it involves suppression of hopes and fears,  loves and hates, and the whole subjective emotional life, until we  become subdued to the material, able to see it frankly, without  preconceptions, without bias, without any wish except to see it as it  is, and without any belief that what it is must be determined by some  relation, positive or negative, to what we should like it to be, or to  what we can easily imagine it to be.    Now in philosophy this attitude of mind has not as yet been achieved.  A certain self-absorption, not personal, but human, has marked almost  all attempts to conceive the universe as a whole. Mind, or some aspect  of it--thought or will or sentience--has been regarded as the pattern  after which the universe is to be conceived, for no better reason, at  bottom, than that such a universe would not seem strange, and would  give us the cosy feeling that every place is like home. To conceive  the universe as essentially progressive or essentially deteriorating,  for example, is to give to our hopes and fears a cosmic importance  which _may_, of course, be justified, but which we have as yet no  reason to suppose justified. Until we have learnt to think of it in  ethically neutral terms, we have not arrived at a scientific attitude  in philosophy; and until we have arrived at such an attitude, it is  hardly to be hoped that philosophy will achieve any solid results.    I have spoken so far largely of the negative aspect of the scientific  spirit, but it is from the positive aspect that its value is derived.  The instinct of constructiveness, which is one of the chief incentives  to artistic creation, can find in scientific systems a satisfaction  more massive than any epic poem. Disinterested curiosity, which is the  source of almost all intellectual effort, finds with astonished  delight that science can unveil secrets which might well have seemed  for ever undiscoverable. The desire for a larger life and wider  interests, for an escape from private circumstances, and even from the  whole recurring human cycle of birth and death, is fulfilled by the  impersonal cosmic outlook of science as by nothing else. To all these  must be added, as contributing to the happiness of the man of science,  the admiration of splendid achievement, and the consciousness of  inestimable utility to the human race. A life devoted to science is  therefore a happy life, and its happiness is derived from the very  best sources that are open to dwellers on this troubled and passionate  planet.          III    A FREE MAN'S WORSHIP[9]      To Dr. Faustus in his study Mephistopheles told the history of the  Creation, saying:    \"The endless praises of the choirs of angels had begun to grow  wearisome; for, after all, did he not deserve their praise? Had he not  given them endless joy? Would it not be more amusing to obtain  undeserved praise, to be worshipped by beings whom he tortured? He  smiled inwardly, and resolved that the great drama should be  performed.    \"For countless ages the hot nebula whirled aimlessly through space. At  length it began to take shape, the central mass threw off planets, the  planets cooled, boiling seas and burning mountains heaved and tossed,  from black masses of cloud hot sheets of rain deluged the barely solid  crust. And now the first germ of life grew in the depths of the ocean,  and developed rapidly in the fructifying warmth into vast forest  trees, huge ferns springing from the damp mould, sea monsters  breeding, fighting, devouring, and passing away. And from the  monsters, as the play unfolded itself, Man was born, with the power of  thought, the knowledge of good and evil, and the cruel thirst for  worship. And Man saw that all is passing in this mad, monstrous world,  that all is struggling to snatch, at any cost, a few brief moments of  life before Death's inexorable decree. And Man said: 'There is a  hidden purpose, could we but fathom it, and the purpose is good; for  we must reverence something, and in the visible world there is nothing  worthy of reverence.' And Man stood aside from the struggle, resolving  that God intended harmony to come out of chaos by human efforts. And  when he followed the instincts which God had transmitted to him from  his ancestry of beasts of prey, he called it Sin, and asked God to  forgive him. But he doubted whether he could be justly forgiven, until  he invented a divine Plan by which God's wrath was to have been  appeased. And seeing the present was bad, he made it yet worse, that  thereby the future might be better. And he gave God thanks for the  strength that enabled him to forgo even the joys that were possible.  And God smiled; and when he saw that Man had become perfect in  renunciation and worship, he sent another sun through the sky, which  crashed into Man's"]]]
