In his efforts to be persuasive, both here and in the  _Areopagitica_, he humbles himself to management and the seasonings of  flattery. It is a new trade for him, and suits oddly with his pride. But  he hoped much, at this time, from the Parliament, that \"select assembly,\"  containing so many \"worthy senators\" and \"Christian reformers,\" \"judges  and lawgivers.\" In the enthusiasm of his hopes, he credits them with a  desire \"to imitate the old and elegant humanity of Greece,\" with a wisdom  greater than that of the Athenian Parliament, with a magnanimous  willingness to repeal their own acts at the dictate of the voice of  reason. And all this at a time when the Presbyterians were in the  ascendant, intent upon establishing a discipline neither old, nor  elegant, nor humane, so little acquainted with Greece, that it was one of  Selden's amusements to confute their divines by citing a reading from the  Greek Testament. Milton was destined to grievous disappointment, and his  rage against the Presbyterians, in some of his later pamphlets, was the  fiercer.    But although his pamphlets are both occasional and personal, and even  address themselves at times to conciliation and persuasion, the views  that they advocate and the system of thought that underlies them were not  the products of time and accident. Milton was an idealist, pure and  simple, in politics. Had he lived under the Tudor sovereigns, he would  have been reduced, with Sir Thomas More, Montaigne, and John Barclay, the  author of _Argenis_, to express himself by way of romance and allegory.  It was his fortune to live at a time when the Tudor state system was  breaking up with appalling suddenness, and along with it the Tudor  compromise in the affairs of the Church, imposed from above upon an  unawakened people, was falling into wreckage. Here was an opportunity  that has not often, in the world's history, come to a poet, of realising  the dream that he had dreamed in his study, of setting up again, for the  admiration and comfort of posterity, the model of an ancient Republic.    The best of all Milton's critics has left us the worst account of his  political opinions. Johnson's censure of _Lycidas_, much as it has been  ridiculed and decried, is judicious and discerning compared with his  explanation of Milton's political creed:--\"Milton's republicanism was, I  am afraid, founded in an envious hatred of greatness, and a sullen desire  of independence, in petulance impatient of control, and pride disdainful  of superiority. He hated monarchs in the State, and prelates in the  Church; for he hated all whom he was required to obey. It is to be  suspected that his predominant desire was to destroy, rather than  establish, and that he felt not so much the love of liberty as repugnance  to authority.\" It may, at least, be credited to Johnson for moderation,  that he requires only four of the Seven Deadly Sins, to wit, Pride, Envy,  Anger, and Sloth, to explain Milton's political tenets. Had he permitted  himself another sentence, an easy place might surely have been made for  Gluttony, Luxury, and Covetousness, the three whose absence cannot fail  to be remarked by any lover of thorough and detailed treatment in these  intricate problems of human character.    If, in our more modern fashion, we seek for the origin of Milton's ideas  in his education, his habits of thought, and his admirations, we shall be  obliged to admit that they are all rooted in his conception of the  ancient City State. It was the wish of Thomas Hobbes to abolish the study  of Greek and Latin in our schools and colleges, because this study  fosters a love of freedom, and unfits men to be the subjects of an  absolute monarch. His happiest illustration would have been the case of  his contemporary, Milton. Yet in all Milton's writings there is no trace  of the modern democratic doctrine of equality. A hearing is all that he  claims. So far from hating greatness, he carries his admiration for it,  for personal virtue and prowess, almost to excess. The poet who described  the infernal conclave in the Second Book of _Paradise Lost_ was not  likely to be insensible to the part played in politics by men of eminent  and dominating personality. To think of free government as of an engine  for depressing unusual merit was impossible for Milton. He lived in an  age that had found in Plutarch's men its highest ideals of political  character. Never, since their own day, had the \"noble Grecians and  Romans\" exercised so irresistible a fascination on the minds of men, or  so real an influence on the affairs of the State, as was theirs at the  time of the Renaissance. The mist in which they had long been enveloped  was swept away, and these colossal figures of soldiers, patriots, and  counsellors loomed large and clear across the ages, their majesty  enhanced by distance and by art, which conspire to efface all that is  accidental, petty, and distracting. We cannot see these figures as they  appeared to the Renaissance world. One of the chief results of modern  historical labour and research has been that it has peopled the Middle  Ages for us, and interposed a whole society of living men, our ancestors,  between us and ancient Rome. But in Milton's time this process was only  beginning; the collections and researches that made it possible were  largely the work of his contemporaries,--and were despised by him. When  he looked back on the world's history, from his own standpoint, he saw,  near at hand and stretching away into the distance, a desert, from which  a black mass of cloud had just been lifted; and, across the desert, lying  fair under the broad sunshine, a city--      With gilded battlements, conspicuous far,    Turrets and terrasses, and glittering spires.    It was towards this ancient civic life, with its arts and arms and long  renown, that he reached forth passionate hands of yearning. The  intervening tract, whither his younger feet had wandered, almost ceased  to exist for him; the paladins and ladies of mediaeval story were the  deceitful mirage of the desert; the true life of antiquity lay beyond. In  all his allusions to the great themes of romance two things are  noticeable: first, how deeply his imagination had been stirred by them,  so that they are used as a last crown of decoration in some of the most  exalted passages of his great poems; and next, how careful he is to stamp  them as fiction. His studies for the early _History of Britain_ had  cloyed him with legends conveyed from book to book. Once convinced that  no certain historical ground could be found for the feet among the whole  mass of these traditions, Milton ceased to regard them as eligible  subjects for his greatest poem. But their beauty dwelt with him; the  memory of the embattled chivalry of Arthur and Charlemagne recurs to him  when he is seeking for the topmost reach of human power and splendour  that he may belittle it by the side of Satan's rebel host; and the  specious handmaidens who served the Tempter's phantom banquet in the  desert are described as lovely beyond what has been                      Fabled since    Of fairy damsels met in forest wide    By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones,    Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.    If Milton's attitude to mediaeval romance is one of regretful suspicion,  his attitude to the greatest of mediaeval institutions is one of bitter  contempt. He inveighs even against the \"antiquitarians,\" such as Camden,  who, he says, \"cannot but love bishops as well as old coins and his much  lamented monasteries, for antiquity's sake.\" For near twelve hundred  years these same bishops \"have been in England to our souls a sad and  doleful succession of illiterate and blind guides.\" It is needless to  multiply extracts illustrative of Milton's opinions on the Church; behind  the enormous wealth of rhetoric and invective poured forth in his  pamphlets, the opinions that he holds are few and simple. When he had  been disappointed by the Presbyterians, and had finally turned from them,  his beliefs inclined more and more, in two points at least, to the tenets  of the newly arisen sect of Quakers--to a pure spiritualism in religion,  and the complete separation of Church and State. Their horror of war he  never shared. The model of the Church he sought in the earliest records  of Christianity, and less and less even there; the model of the State in  the ancient republics. All subsequent experience and precedent was to him  a hindrance and a mischief. So rapidly and easily does his mind leap from  the ancient to the modern world, that even when he speaks of his love for  the drama, as in his first Latin elegy or in _Il Penseroso_, it is  sometimes difficult to say whether he is thinking of the Elizabethan or  of the Attic dramatists.    The lodestar of his hopes is liberty, his main end the establishment of  \"a free commonwealth.\" He knows as well as Montesquieu that democracy in  its pristine dignity can be erected only on a wide foundation of public  virtue. \"To govern well,\" he declares in the treatise _Of Reformation in  England_, \"is to train up a nation in true wisdom and virtue, and that  which springs from thence, magnanimity (take heed of that), and that  which is our beginning, regeneration, and happiest end, likeness to God,  which in one word we call godliness;... other things follow as the shadow  does the substance.\" In the same pamphlet this envious hater of greatness  remarks that \"to govern a nation piously and justly, which only is to say  happily, is for a spirit of the greatest size, and divinest mettle.\" And  men worthy of this description had, as it seemed to him, arisen in his  own time. His praise of Cromwell and the leaders associated with him is  almost extravagant in its enthusiasm. \"While you, O Cromwell, are left  among us, he hardly shows a proper confidence in the Supreme, who  distrusts the security of England,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21687"],[0,"The Youngest Girl in the Fifth: A School Story (#9)"],[1," set has no right to monopolize  everything.\"    \"It is sickening, certainly.\"    \"It's worse than sickening, it's intolerable, and I'm going to make a  stand against it.\"    \"You can try if you like, but you needn't expect success.\"    When Gwen had a cause to champion, she was ready for a fight, even on  the losing side. One of her characteristics was a strong sense of  justice, and here, she considered, was a distinct case of oppression.  She thought over her plan of campaign, and decided that she would ask  to be admitted to the Dramatic Club. Next morning, accordingly, she  approached the five or six girls who constituted that society.    \"Want to join our Dramatic Club!\" exclaimed Louise Mawson almost  incredulously. \"I dare say you do!\"    \"But you won't!\" said Hilda Browne quickly.    \"Cheek!\" ejaculated Rachel Hunter.    \"Why shouldn't I join?\"    \"On the other hand, why should you?\"    \"Because a society ought to be open to the whole Form, and not just  kept amongst a few. We didn't manage things like that in the Upper  Fourth.\"    \"How very kind of you, fresh from the Juniors, to come and give us  Seniors a lesson in managing our affairs! Perhaps you'd like to be  President? Would that content you?\" enquired Hilda Browne  sarcastically.    \"I don't want to be President, but I claim the right to have some say  in the matter. The thing ought to be properly constituted, and every  girl in the Form ought to vote for officers.\"    \"Well, of all cool proposals!\"    \"Look here, Gwen Gascoyne, you need suppressing!\"    \"She's not worth noticing!\"    It was only what Gwen had expected, but she felt she had at any rate  opened fire. She did not mean to retire vanquished after a first  attempt. She now directed her energies to another quarter. She  canvassed the entire Form, asking each girl separately if she did not  consider the Dramatic Club ought to be put upon a general basis.  Everybody, except those who were already members, agreed. Many had  thought the present arrangement unfair, and had grumbled loudly,  though nobody had had the initiative to start a revolt. Now Joan  Masters and Elspeth Frazer took the matter in hand seriously, tackled  the clique, and argued the question.    \"You may run a private club if you like for your own amusement,\" said  Elspeth, \"but if you're going to call it 'The Fifth Form Dramatic',  and give a performance before the other Forms at Christmas, then it  must be a fair and open thing. Everyone must be eligible for  membership, and officers should be chosen by ballot.\"    \"Half of you wouldn't be able to join,\" declared Hilda Browne.    \"That's our own lookout. The point is that we ought to be able to do  so if we want. If you persist in keeping it all to yourselves, you may  act without an audience, for none of us will come to see you, and  we'll tell the other Forms what the quarrel is.\"    \"I know they'd back us up,\" said Joan Masters.    Very unwillingly the clique gave way. They knew they had no just  ground for their position, but they had hoped it would not be called  in question.    \"It's all the fault of Gwen Gascoyne, with her Lower School notions,\"  said Rachel Hunter.    \"She needn't think she's going to act!\" asserted Edith Arnold.    \"Don't want to!\" rapped out Gwen, who happened to overhear. \"I should  miss the bus if I stayed behind after four. I only wanted to see  things made fair and square.\"    Though the new arrangements were really owing to Gwen's enterprise,  nobody was willing to accord her any thanks. Joan Masters and Elspeth  Frazer received all the credit for having righted the wrong; and  though a few might remember that Gwen had started the movement, they  were almost ready to agree with Rachel Hunter that it was rather  pushing of an ex-Junior to have taken so much upon herself. They had  not yet forgiven her translation to the Fifth, and only the utmost  humility on her part would have reconciled them. Humility was  certainly not Gwen's characteristic, so she still went by the epithet  of \"that cheeky kid\" in the Form.    \"So much for their gratitude,\" confided Gwen to Lesbia. \"I don't want  to act, but some of those who have got into the play might at least  acknowledge what I've done for them.\"    \"They seem a hateful set!\" sympathized Lesbia.    \"Detestable!\" said Gwen with unction.    One thing had not been settled by the Dramatic Society, and that was  their choice of a President. Names were canvassed freely in the Form,  and finally Hilda Browne and Elspeth Frazer were put up as candidates.  Voting was to be by ballot during the interval, but while the papers  were being given out Gwen bolted. She was feeling cross and forlorn,  and sick of the whole affair.    \"I don't mind who's chosen President,\" she thought \"It makes no  difference to me. They may elect whom they like.\"    So she went a solitary little walk round the playground, whistling a  tune, and trying to look as if she didn't care about anything. She had  not been there very long before she saw Betty Brierley and Ida Young  signalling to her from the gymnasium door. She took no notice of their  beckonings, whereupon they ran after her, and seizing her one by each  arm, began to drag her towards the house.    \"You're wanted most particularly, Gwen Gascoyne!\" said Betty  excitedly.    \"We've been sent to fetch you quick!\" chimed in Ida.    \"Hello! Hands off!\" cried Gwen, dragging herself from their grasp.  \"What do you want with me, I should like to know?\"    \"It's the others who want you.\"    \"What for? Didn't know I was so popular!\"    \"You've not voted for a President yet.\"    \"No, and I don't mean to, either.\"    \"But, Gwen, you must! We've taken the ballot, and the votes are  exactly even. You've got the casting vote!\"    \"Have I, indeed? No, thank you! It's rather too great an honour!\"    \"But look here, Gwen, it's the only way to decide it. We've got to  choose either Elspeth or Hilda.\"    \"Then you may fight it out amongst you. You don't suppose, when you've  all voted by ballot, that I'm going to take the responsibility of a  casting vote. It's a most unfair proposal. Why, the rejected candidate  and all on her side would never forgive me!\"    \"We might have the ballot again,\" suggested Betty. \"Then you need only  put your cross.\"    \"As if everybody wouldn't know who was responsible for the extra  cross! I might as well write Gwen Gascoyne on my paper at once! It's  no use pulling my arm; I'm not coming in to be made a cat's paw. You  may go and tell the others so if you like.\"    Betty and Ida departed, grumbling loudly at Gwen's  \"unaccommodatingness\", as they called it, and Gwen stayed in the  playground until the bell rang, fuming with indignation. Every fresh  little episode seemed to serve to make her more of an alien in the  Form than ever. But here her decision was absolutely justifiable; not  one of the girls would have cared to accept the unenviable role which  they had wished to thrust upon her. Perhaps for that very reason they  were all the more annoyed at her action. She was received with black  looks when she re-entered the classroom. Elspeth Frazer whispered  something to a friend, and turned away. Gwen could not quite hear, but  it sounded painfully like \"beast!\"    \"Have they settled it?\" she asked Netta.    \"Yes; Elspeth and Hilda drew lots, and Hilda won. I'm fearfully sorry  she did. Elspeth says it's all your fault, and that you ought to have  voted for her when you'd made such a fuss about the clique.\"    \"Would you have given a casting vote yourself?\"    \"Well, no; but if you'd only stayed and voted by ballot like everyone  else, then nobody would have known who'd given the odd one. It was  most stupid of you to rush away. You're rather an idiot, Gwen  Gascoyne!\"    \"'_Et tu, Brute!_ Then fall, Caesar!' I'm like the old man and his ass  in AEsop; I seem to end by pleasing nobody.\"    \"Do you wish to compare yourself with the old man or the quadruped, my  child? The latter's the more apt, certainly!\"    \"Oh, good night!\" said Gwen, who was getting the worst of it \"I wish  sometimes I'd never come into your wretched Form.\"    \"You'd be far more at home among the Juniors!\" snapped Netta, rather  out of temper.    A few days after this was the Rodenhurst Annual Distribution of  Prizes. It was always held in the beginning of November, rather an  unusual date, to be sure, but Miss Roscoe found it convenient in many  ways to have it in the middle of the autumn term. It gave plenty of  time to receive examiners' reports, and to chronicle successes in the  July examinations, but on the other hand it did not interfere with  Christmas celebrations.    The function took place in the Town Hall at Stedburgh, and there was  invariably a large gathering of parents and friends. To the whole  school it seemed an important occasion, and both Gwen and Lesbia were  full of excitement when the afternoon arrived.    \"Not that I need alarm myself that I shall be called upon to walk up  and receive a prize!\" said Lesbia. \"Never got one in my life, and  never shall!\"    \"You might get the Sewing or the Holiday Competitions,\" said Gwen,  trying to be encouraging.    \"No fear! One genius is enough in a family! I'll go prepared to clap  you!\"    All the girls wore white dresses and blue hair ribbons, and made quite  an imposing array as they sat in the central aisle of the large room  at the Town Hall.    \"There seem to be far more of us when we're in white!\" said Gwen. \"We  don't look half so many in the lecture hall at school. Have a few  little angels crept in unawares?\"    \"You're not one of them, at any rate,\" laughed Netta, who was sitting  next to her.    To Gwen the great feature of the occasion was that Father was seated  on the platform, in company with several other clergymen and the  Mayor, who was to distribute the prizes. Beatrice was amongst the  audience, and had brought Martin with her, and Giles and Basil had  come with the Boys' contingent. All her"]]]
