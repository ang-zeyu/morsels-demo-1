[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],[0,"Classic French Course in English (#9)"],[1,"   Montaigne's \"Essays\" are, as we have said, himself. Such is his own way  of putting the fact. To one admiring his essays to him, he frankly  replied, \"You will like me, if you like my essays, for they are myself.\"  The originality, the creative character and force, of the \"Essays,\" lies  in this autobiographical quality in them. Their fascination, too,  consists in the self-revelation they contain. This was, first,  self-revelation on the part of the writer; but no less it becomes, in  each case, self-revelation in the experience of the reader. For, as face  answereth to face in the glass, so doth the heart of man to man,--from  race to race, and from generation to generation. If Montaigne, in his  \"Essays,\" held the mirror up to himself, he, in the same act, held up  the mirror to you and to me. The image that we, reading, call Montaigne,  is really ourselves. We never tire of gazing on it. We are all of us  Narcissuses. This is why Montaigne is an immortal and a universal  writer.    Here is Montaigne's Preface to his \"Essays;\" \"The Author to the Reader,\"  it is entitled:--         Reader, thou hast here an honest book; it doth at the outset       forewarn thee that, in contriving the same, I have proposed to       myself no other than a domestic and private end: I have had no       consideration at all either to thy service or to my glory. My       powers are not capable of any such design. I have dedicated it to       the particular commodity of my kinsfolk and friends, so that,       having lost me (which they must do shortly), they may therein       recover some traits of my conditions and humors, and by that means       preserve more whole, and more life-like, the knowledge they had of       me. Had my intention been to seek the world's favor, I should       surely have adorned myself with borrowed beauties. I desire therein       to be viewed as I appear in mine own genuine, simple, and ordinary       manner, without study and artifice; for it is myself I paint. My       defects are therein to be read to the life, and my imperfections       and my natural form, so far as public reverence hath permitted me.       If I had lived among those nations which (they say) yet dwell under       the sweet liberty of nature's primitive laws, I assure thee I would       most willingly have painted myself quite fully, and quite naked.       Thus, reader, myself am the matter of my book. There's no reason       thou shouldst employ thy leisure about so frivolous and vain a       subject. Therefore, farewell.         From Montaigne, the 12th of June, 1580.    Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, our author, as the foregoing date will have  suggested, derived his most familiar name from the place at which he was  born and at which he lived. Readers are not to take too literally  Montaigne's notice of his dispensing with \"borrowed beauties.\" He was,  in fact, a famous borrower. He himself warns his readers to be careful  how they criticise him; they may be flouting unawares Seneca, Plutarch,  or some other, equally redoubtable, of the reverend ancients. Montaigne  is perhaps as signal an example as any in literature, of the man of  genius exercising his prescriptive right to help himself to his own  wherever he may happen to find it. But Montaigne has in turn been freely  borrowed from. Bacon borrowed from him, Shakspeare borrowed from him,  Dryden, Pope, Hume, Burke, Byron,--these, with many more, in England;  and, in France, Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Voltaire, Rousseau,--directly  or indirectly, almost every writer since his day. No modern writer,  perhaps, has gone in solution into subsequent literature more widely  than Montaigne. But no writer remains more solidly and insolubly entire.    We go at once to chapter twenty-five of the first book of the \"Essays,\"  entitled, in the English translation, \"Of the education of children.\"  The translation we use henceforth throughout is the classic one of  Charles Cotton, in a text of it edited by Mr. William Carew Hazlitt. The  \"preface,\" already given, Cotton omitted to translate. We have allowed  Mr. Hazlitt to supply the deficiency. Montaigne addresses his  educational views to a countess. Several others of his essays are  similarly inscribed to women. Mr. Emerson's excuse of Montaigne for his  coarseness,--that he wrote for a generation in which women were not  expected to be readers,--is thus seen to be curiously impertinent to the  actual case that existed. Of a far worse fault in Montaigne than his  coarseness,--we mean his outright immorality,--Mr. Emerson makes no  mention, and for it, therefore, provides no excuse. We shall ourselves,  in due time, deal more openly with our readers on this point.    It was for a \"boy of quality\" that Montaigne aimed to adapt his  suggestions on the subject of education. In this happy country of ours,  all boys are boys of quality; and we shall go nowhere amiss in selecting  from the present essay:--         For a boy of quality, then, I say, I would also have his friends       solicitous to find him out a tutor who has rather a well-made than       a well-filled head, seeking, indeed, both the one and the other,       but rather of the two to prefer manners and judgment to mere       learning, and that this man should exercise his charge after a new       method.         'Tis the custom of pedagogues to be eternally thundering in their       pupil's ears, as they were pouring into a funnel, whilst the       business of the pupil is only to repeat what the others have said:       now, I would have a tutor to correct this error, and that, at the       very first, he should, according to the capacity he has to deal       with, put it to the test, permitting his pupil himself to taste       things, and of himself to discern and choose them, sometimes       opening the way to him, and sometimes leaving him to open it for       himself; that is, I would not have him alone to invent and speak,       but that he should also hear his pupil speak in turn.... Let him       make him put what he has learned into a hundred several forms, and       accommodate it to so many several subjects, to see if he yet       rightly comprehends it, and has made it his own.... 'Tis a sign of       crudity and indigestion to disgorge what we eat in the same       condition it was swallowed: the stomach has not performed its       office, unless it have altered the form and condition of what was       committed to it to concoct....         Let him make him examine and thoroughly sift every thing he reads,       and lodge nothing in his fancy upon simple authority and upon       trust. Aristotle's principles will then be no more principles to       him than those of Epicurus and the Stoics: let this diversity of       opinions be propounded to, and laid before, him; he will himself       choose, if he be able; if not, he will remain in doubt.         \"Che, non men che saper, dubbiar m'aggrata.\" DANTE, _Inferno_, xl.       93.         [\"That doubting pleases me, not less than knowing.\" LONGFELLOW'S       _Translation_.]         For, if he embrace the opinions of Xenophon and Plato, by his own       reason, they will no more be theirs, but become his own. Who       follows another, follows nothing, finds nothing, nay, is       inquisitive after nothing. \"Non sumus sub rege; sibi quisque se       vindicet.\" [\"We are under no king; let each look to       himself.\"--SENECA, _Ep._ 33.] Let him, at least, know that he       knows. It will be necessary that he imbibe their knowledge, not       that he be corrupted with their precepts; and no matter if he       forget where he had his learning, provided he know how to apply it       to his own use. Truth and reason are common to every one, and are       no more his who spake them first, than his who speaks them after;       'tis no more according to Plato, than according to me, since both       he and I equally see and understand them. Bees cull their several       sweets from this flower and that blossom, here and there where they       find them; but themselves afterward make the honey, which is all       and purely their own, and no more thyme and marjoram: so the       several fragments he borrows from others he will transform and       shuffle together, to compile a work that shall be absolutely his       own; that is to say, his judgment: his instruction, labor, and       study tend to nothing else but to form that.... Conversation with       men is of very great use, and travel into foreign countries;... to       be able chiefly to give an account of the humors, manners, customs,       and laws of those nations where he has been, and that we may whet       and sharpen our wits by rubbing them against those of others....         In this conversing with men, I mean also, and principally, those       who live only in the records of history: he shall, by reading those       books, converse with the great and heroic souls of the best ages.    It is difficult to find a stopping-place in discourse so wise and so  sweet. We come upon sentences like Plato for height and for beauty. An  example: \"The most manifest sign of wisdom is a continual cheerfulness;  her state is like that of things in the regions above the moon, always  clear and serene.\" But the genius of Montaigne does not often soar,  though even one little flight like that shows that it has wings.  Montaigne's garnishes of quotation from foreign tongues are often a  cold-blooded device of afterthought with him. His first edition was  without them, in many places where subsequently they appear. Readers  familiar with Emerson will be reminded of him in perusing Montaigne.  Emerson himself said, \"It seemed to me [in reading the \"Essays\" of  Montaigne] as if I had myself written the book in some former life, so  sincerely it spoke to my thoughts and experience.\" The rich old English  of Cotton's translation had evidently a strong influence on Emerson, to  mould his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],[0,"Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#9)"],[1,"a dispute of any sort  occurred among the inhabitants of our little world.  If one differed in  opinion from another, it was always good naturedly, and all discussions  were finished amicably.  People in families on shore would always be  able to do the same if they kept a watch over their tempers, and did not  allow envy, jealousy, and pride to spring up and hold dominion in their  hearts.    Our tempers were occasionally tried.  When within a week's sail of the  western shores of Australia the wind fell to a dead calm.  The sea was  smooth as glass, and the hot sun came down with fearful force on our  heads, while the reflection of his rays from the glittering sea almost  blinded our eyes.  Long as I had ploughed the salt ocean, I had never  felt the heat greater.  For two or three days it was endurable, but  after that every one began to complain; even Duchess looked out for a  shady place, under the sail or bulwarks, to lie down in, and poor  Steadfast went panting about the deck with his tongue out, the fowls  hung down their heads, and the merry robins and sparrows ceased to  chirp.  If a chip or a feather was thrown overboard, it lay motionless  alongside, though the schooner herself kept moving round, with her head  towards all the points of the compass.    The heat created a violent thirst: everybody was thirsty--the men, my  children, my wife and I, and the poor animals; they required water more  than we did, for they got no moisture out of the packed hay.  We gave  them as much as we dared, and, as soon as the sun was down, had them on  deck to give them fresh air.    We were not alone in our misfortunes, however, for when the sun rose, on  the first morning of the calm, his rays fell on the white canvas of a  ship, just rising out of the western horizon.  After some time she  disappeared, either because her sails had been clewed up, or that she  was too far off to be seen unless the sun was shining directly on them.  We had many discussions as to what she was.  I need scarcely say that  she caused us no little uneasiness.    Still the calm continued.  Day after day the sun went down in the calm  ocean, and rose again to cast a ruddy glow over its mirror-like surface,  and there in the distance lay the stranger, though only sharp eyes could  have detected her.    I began to be very anxious about the sheep.  The success of the  undertaking depended in a great measure on their being kept alive,  still, we had to put them on an allowance, as we had ourselves.  Little  Margaret and Tommy couldn't understand why they shouldn't have as much  water as they wanted, when there was plenty alongside.  They could not  understand that salt water was worse than no water at all; nor could the  poor sheep, probably, when they were brought up on deck, and gazed out  on the glittering ocean around them.    When matters had come to this pass, I began for the first time to lose  heart.  I was sitting with my head bowed down, resting on my hand, when  my boy Peter said to me--\"Father I have an idea--I have heard that fresh  water may be got out of salt, and I think I can manage it, if you do not  mind expending our fuel.\"    These words restored my spirits.  We had laid in a large supply of fuel  at the Cape; water was of more consequence than anything else.  It would  be better to break up all the spare cases, and even the bulkheads and  cabin furniture, than to go without it.  Peter soon explained his plan;  I agreed to try it.  We, after a search among the cargo, found two large  camp kettles.  Soldering down their lids, we bored a hole in the top of  one and in the side of the other, and joined the two with a piece of  piping, three feet long.  The one with a hole in the top we placed on  the fire.  We fitted a funnel to the spout, through which we poured in  water; the other kettle was fixed on a stand, and we soldered a small  pipe in at the bottom.  Above the outside kettle we slung a bucket full  of water also, with a small pipe in it, and the top of the kettle we  covered over with cloths, which, by the means of the bucket, were kept  constantly wet.  The kettle on the fire was filled, the fire blazed up,  and, as the water boiled, we watched with anxiety the result of the  process.  Some drops at length fell from the lower kettle, and a jug was  ready to catch them.  Peter eagerly poured the water into a mug, and,  putting it to his lips, with a triumphant smile passed it round to us  all.  It was deliciously cool and perfectly sweet.  It now came pouring  out quickly, and we got up an empty cask to contain it.  We all knelt  down and thanked God that we had obtained the means for sustaining life,  should our supply of water altogether fail.  It took a long time, and  used up a large quantity of fuel to produce even a gallon of fresh  water, yet a gallon was sufficient liquid for everybody on board for a  couple of days, and we might thus give a larger share to the sheep.    You might not think so, but the gale off the Cape did not cause me as  much anxiety as this long calm.  I ought, I confess, to have remembered  that in both instances God was watching over us.  In the one, I trusted  to my stout little craft and my seamanship; in the other, my seamanship  was of no avail--the stoutest ship would not have prevented all on board  dying a frightful death had the calm continued.  Here was my human  folly: on both occasions, had I thrown all my care on God, I should have  saved myself from all the anxiety I had suffered.  This was increased by  the uncertainty I felt as to the character of the sail we saw in the  distance.  I was in my own mind persuaded that she was a French  privateer, and if we were discovered, her boats would probably pay us a  visit, even if she did not.    We were all seated languidly about on the deck, under an awning rigged  to give us some shade, when Peter started up, exclaiming, \"There comes  the breeze.\"  Some downy feathers, fastened by a silk thread to the  after backstay, had, he thought, moved for a moment though the vane  quickly dropped again.  We were speedily on foot, but the first glance  at the glowing, tranquil ocean, like some huge mirror on which we were  resting, made me fear that my son had been mistaken.  I shook my head,  and a sigh escaped from several of our party, as they sank down again on  their seats.  Just then, however, I caught sight of a light cat's-paw  skimming over the water in the distance, and Peter, springing at the  same moment into the rigging and pointing westward, exclaimed, \"Here it  comes, father, no mistake about it now.\"  I followed him up the rigging,  and saw in the far west a wide-extending dark blue line moving quickly  on towards us.  Peter and I sprang back on deck, got the awning stowed,  the head sails set, and the big square-sail ready for hoisting.  The  cat's-paws came thicker and thicker, the dark blue line increasing in  width, till in a short time we were staggering away before as brisk a  breeze as the little craft could desire.  All languor quickly vanished,  and we served out an additional supply of water to our poor sheep.  My  anxiety, however, did not cease, for just afterwards, as I was sweeping  the horizon with my telescope, I saw, rising above it, the royals of a  square-rigged ship, the same, I concluded, which I had seen at the  commencement of the calm.  She might be a friend, or an English ship,  and be ready to supply us with any necessaries we might require: but I  had taken it into my head that she was an enemy, and I could not tell to  what treatment we might be subjected.  Sometimes French officers behaved  very kindly to passengers captured by them, but during the republican  period many of those in command were brutal men, who outraged all the  laws of humanity when they got the crews and passengers of an English  ship into their power.  I, of course, said nothing of this to my wife or  children.  I, however consulted with Charley White and Peter, and we  agreed that it would be more prudent to alter our course to the  northward for a few hours, so as to allow the ship to pass us during the  night.  Though we were not now visible to her, when the sun came to set  in the west she would have got so far nearer to us that his rays falling  on our canvas, we should be probably seen from her tops.    This plan we followed.  Charley White had become even more anxious than  I was, and he was constantly going aloft to watch the stranger.  Half an  hour before sunset, we could see half way down her topsails from the  deck.  Though they looked no bigger than a small pocket handkerchief,  the sharp eyes of my girls caught sight of them, and seemed much  surprised that we were not eager to speak with the stranger.  I was very  glad when darkness hid us, as I hoped, from her.  We arranged, however,  to keep a bright look out all night, and to furl everything, should she  pass near us, so as to escape observation.  Charley and Peter kept a  watch together.  They insisted on my turning in after my first watch was  over, and in truth I could leave the vessel in their care with as much  confidence as if I had her myself.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    A JOYFUL DISCOVERY.    More than once I saw in my dreams a big ship closing rapidly with us and  the French flag run up at the main, and a voice ordering us to heave to.  We were all to be made prisoners; horrible would be the fate of those  dearest to me.  I started up in a cold perspiration, though the weather  was hot enough as may be supposed.    There was scarcely a sound except the rippling of the water against the  vessel's side, the breathing of those sleeping round me in our little  cabin, and the tread of Peter's feet overhead.  Charley was at the helm  I guessed.  He said something, and then they both burst into a merry  laugh.  \"All's right,\" I thought to myself, \"I know why I had that  uncomfortable dream.  I was over anxious.  I ought, having done my best,  to have"]]]
