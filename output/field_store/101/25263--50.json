It is a record from which the Christian woman often turns  aside appalled. Human nature can read no lessons of humility more  powerful than those contained in the newspapers of the day. They preach  what may be called home truths with most tremendous force. From this  record of daily crime it is only too clear that universal suffrage has  had no power to purify the society in which we live. If no worse, we  can not claim to be better than other nations, under a different  political rule.    This admission becomes the more painful when we reflect that in America  this full freedom of fundamental institutions, this relief from all  needless shackles, is combined with a well-developed system of  intellectual education. We are an absolutely free nation. We are, on  the whole, and to a certain point, intellectually, an educated nation.  Yet vice and crime exist among us to an extent that is utterly  disgraceful. It is evident, therefore, that universal manhood suffrage,  even when combined with general education, is still insufficient for  the task of purifying either social or political life. The theoretical  infidel philosopher may wonder at this fact. Not so the Christian.  Great intellectual activity, and the abuse of that power for evil  purposes, are a spectacle only too common in this world. Look at the  present condition of the most civilized nations. Of all generations  that have lived on earth, our own is assuredly the most enlightened, in  an intellectual sense; mental culture has never been so generally  diffused as it is to-day, nor has it ever achieved so many conquests as  within the last half century; and yet mark how comparatively little has  this wonderful intellectual progress accomplished in the noble work of  improving the moral condition of the most enlightened countries. To the  mind humbled by Christian doctrine, living in the light of a holy  faith, these facts, though unspeakably painful, can not cause surprise.  We are prepared for them. We have already learned that no mere  legislative enactment and no mere intellectual training can suffice to  purify the human heart thoroughly. An element much more powerful than  mental culture is needed for that great work. For this work light from  on high is sent. A thorough MORAL EDUCATION is required, and the  highest form of that education can be reached in one way only--by  walking in the plain path of obedience to the will of the Creator, as  revealed in Holy Scripture. We must turn, not to Plato and Aristotle,  but to inspired Prophet and Apostle. We must open our hearts to the  spirit of the Decalogue and the Sermon on the Mount. We must go to  Sinai and to Calvary, and humbly, on bended knee, receive the sublime  lessons to be learned there.    We should never have expected moral progress as an inevitable  consequence of free institutions and mere intellectual education, had  it not been that, like other nations, we indulge in idolatries, and  among our \"gods many\" are the suffrage and mental activity. We are  gravely told by philosophers that, with the vote in the hands of woman,  the moral elevation of the race is secured forever! \"Great is Diana of  the Ephesians!\" The feeling is common in America that to doubt the  omnipotence of universal suffrage in its extreme development is not  only treason, but a sort of blasphemy. And this feeling is now leading  many minds, unconsciously, perhaps, to shrink from opposing the present  movement in favor of womanhood suffrage. They bow the knee to the  common idol. They dare not believe it possible for the suffrage to be  carried too far. For ourselves we have no sympathies whatever with  idolatry. We fearlessly declare our opinion, therefore, that no  political institutions whatever, neither despotic, nor monarchical, nor  aristocratic, nor yet the most free, are capable, in themselves, of  achieving moral education for a people. Neither do we believe it more  possible for abstract intellectual culture to gain this most important  of all ends. Institutions wisely free are a very great blessing. Let us  be fervently thankful for them. Intellectual education is equally  important and desirable. These are both noble and admirable means to  work with, provided we still look above and beyond them for a further  development of the race--for fullness of MORAL CIVILIZATION. In fact,  if we wish for a vigorous, healthful, lasting development of republican  institutions, we must necessarily unite with these not only  intellectual teaching, but also a sound MORAL EDUCATION. This is a fact  to which men, in the whirl of their political or commercial struggles,  too often willfully shut their eyes. They are quite ready to  acknowledge the truth of the assertion in a general way, but they  choose to forget its vast importance in political or commercial  practice. They recklessly lower the moral standard themselves, whenever  that standard is at a height inconvenient for the attaining of some  particular object toward which they are aiming. They are lacking in  faith. Unlike women, who carry faith with them in private life, men act  as if faith were not needed in everyday public life. At least the great  majority of men, nominal Christians, fail to carry Christian principle  with them into common business or politics. Faith, in the heart of  women, is connected with love; consequently it is less easily stifled.  They more frequently carry this principle with them in daily  practice--not to the extent that they should do, but far more so than  most men do. And here, Christian women, is your great advantage. It is  the Lord's work to which we would urge you. The work of true faith,  however lowly, is sure of a blessing. With faith unfeigned in your  hearts, giving purity to your lives, you have it in your power to  render most effectual service to the nation in your own natural sphere,  far beyond what you could possibly accomplish by the path of common  politics. You have never, as yet, done full justice to the advantages  of your own actual position in this respect. You have overlooked the  great work immediately before you. We have no magic talisman to offer  you in carrying out that work. We shall not flatter you with the  promise of unlimited success; we shall not attempt to gratify any  personal ambition of public honors. We have no novel theories or  brilliant illusions with which to dazzle your imagination.      FIDELITY TO PLAIN MORAL DUTIES--THIS IS THE ONE GREAT PRINCIPLE TO  WHICH WE WOULD MOST EARNESTLY CALL YOUR ATTENTION.    There is absolutely no principle so sorely needed in the civilized  world to-day as this. We live in an age of false and inflated  ambitions. Simple moral truths fare badly in our time. Imposing  theories, brilliant novelties, subtle sophistries, exaggerated  development, arrogant pretensions--these too often crowd simple moral  truths out of sight, out of mind. And yet, without that class of duties  in healthful action, corruption more or less general is inevitable.    Truth of word, honesty of action, integrity of character, temperance,  chastity, moderation, sincerity, subordination to just authority,  conjugal fidelity, filial love and honor--these duties, and others  closely connected with them, bear old and homely names. But, Christian  women, you can not ask for a task more noble, more truly elevating, for  yourselves and your country, than to uphold these plain moral  principles, first by your own personal example, and then by all pure  influences in your homes and in the society to which you belong. In no  other mode can you so well forward the great work of Christian  civilization as by devoting yourselves to the daily personal practice,  and to the social cultivation, by example and influence, of these plain  moral duties. Your present domestic position is especially favorable to  this task. You have more time for thought on these subjects; you have  more frequent opportunities for influence over the young nearest to  you; you have more leisure for prayer, for invoking a blessing on your  efforts, however humble they may he. It is not enough to set a decent  example yourselves. You must go to the very root of the matter. You  must carry about with you hearts and minds very deeply impressed with  the incalculable importance of a sound morality; you must be clearly  convinced of the misery, the shame, the perils of all immorality.    In this nineteenth century the civilization of a country must  necessarily prove either heathen or Christian in its spirit. There is  no neutral ground lying between these boundaries. Faith or infidelity,  such is the choice we must all make, whether as individuals or as  nations. Thanks be to God we are not only in name, but also partially  in character, a Christian nation. Faith is not entirely wanting. We all  in a measure feel its good effects. Even the avowed infidel living in  our midst is far more under its influences, though indirectly so, than  he is aware of. And where there is life, there we have hope of growth,  of higher development. To cherish that growth, to further that higher  development by all gracious and loving and generous influences, is a  work for which women are especially adapted. They work from within  outwardly. Men work chiefly by mental and physical pressure from  without. Men work by external authority; women work by influences. Men  seek to control the head. Women always aim at touching the heart. And  we have the highest of all authority for believing that this last is  the most efficient mode of working.    \"Out of the heart are the issues of life.\" This, therefore, Christian  women, is your especial  task. Use all the happy womanly influences in  your power to forward the moral education, the Christian civilization,  of the country to which you belong. Be watchful, with the unfeigned  humility of the Christian, over your own personal course, and the  example connected with it.

The only entrance to it, through Gay-street, is so  difficult, steep, and slippery, that in wet weather, it must be  exceedingly dangerous, both for those that ride in carriages, and those  that walk a-foot; and when the street is covered with snow, as it was  for fifteen days successively this very winter, I don't see how any  individual could go either up or down, without the most imminent hazard  of broken bones. In blowing weather, I am told, most of the houses in  this hill are smothered with smoke, forced down the chimneys, by the  gusts of wind reverberated from the hill behind, which (I apprehend  likewise) must render the atmosphere here more humid and unwholesome  than it is in the square below; for the clouds, formed by the constant  evaporation from the baths and rivers in the bottom, will, in their  ascent this way, be first attracted and detained by the hill that rises  close behind the Circus, and load the air with a perpetual succession of  vapours: this point, however, may be easily ascertained by means of an  hygrometer, or a paper of salt of tartar exposed to the action of  the atmosphere. The same artist who planned the Circus, has likewise  projected a Crescent; when that is finished, we shall probably have a  Star; and those who are living thirty years hence, may, perhaps, see  all the signs of the Zodiac exhibited in architecture at Bath. These,  however fantastical, are still designs that denote some ingenuity and  knowledge in the architect; but the rage of building has laid hold on  such a number of adventurers, that one sees new houses starting up in  every out-let and every corner of Bath; contrived without judgment,  executed without solidity, and stuck together with so little regard  to plan and propriety, that the different lines of the new rows and  buildings interfere with, and intersect one another in every different  angle of conjunction. They look like the wreck of streets and squares  disjointed by an earthquake, which hath broken the ground into a variety  of holes and hillocks; or as if some Gothic devil had stuffed them  altogether in a bag, and left them to stand higgledy piggledy, just as  chance directed. What sort of a monster Bath will become in a few years,  with those growing excrescences, may be easily conceived: but the want  of beauty and proportion is not the worst effect of these new mansions;  they are built so slight, with the soft crumbling stone found in this  neighbourhood, that I shall never sleep quietly in one of them, when  it blowed (as the sailors say) a cap-full of wind; and, I am persuaded,  that my hind, Roger Williams, or any man of equal strength, would be  able to push his foot through the strongest part of their walls, without  any great exertion of his muscles. All these absurdities arise from the  general tide of luxury, which hath overspread the nation, and swept  away all, even the very dregs of the people. Every upstart of fortune,  harnessed in the trappings of the mode, presents himself at Bath, as in  the very focus of observation--Clerks and factors from the East Indies,  loaded with the spoil of plundered provinces; planters, negro-drivers,  and hucksters from our American plantations, enriched they know not  how; agents, commissaries, and contractors, who have fattened, in two  successive wars, on the blood of the nation; usurers, brokers, and  jobbers of every kind; men of low birth, and no breeding, have found  themselves suddenly translated into a state of affluence, unknown to  former ages; and no wonder that their brains should be intoxicated with  pride, vanity, and presumption. Knowing no other criterion of greatness,  but the ostentation of wealth, they discharge their affluence without  taste or conduct, through every channel of the most absurd extravagance;  and all of them hurry to Bath, because here, without any further  qualification, they can mingle with the princes and nobles of the land.  Even the wives and daughters of low tradesmen, who, like shovel-nosed  sharks, prey upon the blubber of those uncouth whales of fortune, are  infected with the same rage of displaying their importance; and the  slightest indisposition serves them for a pretext to insist upon being  conveyed to Bath, where they may hobble country-dances and cotillons  among lordlings, squires, counsellors, and clergy. These delicate  creatures from Bedfordbury, Butcher-row, Crutched-friers, and  Botolph-lane, cannot breathe in the gross air of the Lower Town, or  conform to the vulgar rules of a common lodging-house; the husband,  therefore, must provide an entire house, or elegant apartments in the  new buildings. Such is the composition of what is called the fashionable  company at Bath; where a very inconsiderable proportion of genteel  people are lost in a mob of impudent plebeians, who have neither  understanding nor judgment, nor the least idea of propriety and decorum;  and seem to enjoy nothing so much as an opportunity of insulting their  betters.    Thus the number of people, and the number of houses continue to  increase; and this will ever be the case, till the streams that swell  this irresistible torrent of folly and extravagance, shall either be  exhausted, or turned into other channels, by incidents and events which  I do not pretend to foresee. This, I own, is a subject on which I cannot  write with any degree of patience; for the mob is a monster I never  could abide, either in its head, tail, midriff, or members; I detest the  whole of it, as a mass of ignorance, presumption, malice and brutality;  and, in this term of reprobation, I include, without respect of rank,  station, or quality, all those of both sexes, who affect its manners,  and court its society.    But I have written till my fingers are crampt, and my nausea begins to  return--By your advice, I sent to London a few days ago for half a pound  of Gengzeng; though I doubt much, whether that which comes from America  is equally efficacious with what is brought from the East Indies. Some  years ago a friend of mine paid sixteen guineas for two ounces of  it; and, in six months after, it was sold in the same shop for five  shillings the pound. In short, we live in a vile world of fraud and  sophistication; so that I know nothing of equal value with the genuine  friendship of a sensible man; a rare jewel! which I cannot help thinking  myself in possession of, while I repeat the old declaration, that I am,  as usual,    Dear Lewis, Your affectionate M. BRAMBLE,    After having been agitated in a short hurricane, on my first arrival,  I have taken a small house in Milsham-street, where I am tolerably well  lodged, for five guineas a week. I was yesterday at the Pump-room, and  drank about a pint of water, which seems to agree with my stomach; and  to-morrow morning I shall bathe, for the first time; so that in a few  posts you may expect farther trouble; mean while, I am glad to find that  the inoculation has succeeded so well with poor Joyce, and that her face  will be but little marked. If my friend Sir Thomas was a single man,  I would not trust such a handsome wench in his family; but as I have  recommended her, in a particular manner, to the protection of lady G--,  who is one of the best women in the world, she may go thither without  hesitation as soon as she is quite recovered and fit for service--Let  her mother have money to provide her with necessaries, and she may ride  behind her brother on Bucks; but you must lay strong injunctions  on Jack, to take particular care of the trusty old veteran, who has  faithfully earned his present ease by his past services.          To Miss WILLIS at Gloucester. BATH, April 26. MY DEAREST COMPANION,    The pleasure I received from yours, which came to hand yesterday, is  not to be expressed. Love and friendship are, without doubt, charming  passions; which absence serves only to heighten and improve. Your kind  present of the garnet bracelets, I shall keep as carefully as I preserve  my own life; and I beg you will accept, in return, my heart-housewife,  with the tortoise-shell memorandum-book, as a trifling pledge of my  unalterable affection.    Bath is to me a new world--All is gayety, good-humour, and diversion.  The eye is continually entertained with the splendour of dress and  equipage; and the ear with the sound of coaches, chairs, and other  carriages. The merry bells ring round, from morn till night. Then we  are welcomed by the city-waits in our own lodgings; we have music in the  Pump-room every morning, cotillons every forenoon in the rooms, balls  twice a week, and concerts every other night, besides private assemblies  and parties without number--As soon as we were settled in lodgings, we  were visited by the Master of the Ceremonies; a pretty little gentleman,  so sweet, so fine, so civil, and polite, that in our country he might  pass for the prince of Wales; then he talks so charmingly, both in verse  and prose, that you would be delighted to hear him discourse; for you  must know he is a great writer, and has got five tragedies ready for the  stage. He did us the favour to dine with us, by my uncle's invitation;  and next day squired my aunt and me to every part of Bath; which, to be  sure, is an earthly paradise. The Square, the Circus, and the Parades,  put you in mind of the sumptuous palaces represented in prints and  pictures; and the new buildings, such as Princes-row, Harlequin's-row,  Bladud's-row, and twenty other rows, look like so many enchanted  castles, raised on hanging terraces.    At eight in the morning, we go in dishabille to the Pump-room which is  crowded like a Welsh fair; and there you see the highest quality,  and the lowest trades folks, jostling each other, without ceremony,  hail-fellow well-met. The noise of the music playing in the gallery,  the heat and flavour of such a crowd, and the hum and buz of their  conversation, gave me the head-ach and"]]]
