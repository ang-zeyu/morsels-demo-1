Carry Lea, what are you going to wear to the wedding?\"    \"Nothing. I'm not going.\"    \"You are--you must--you shall. I won't take the organdie.\"    \"You'll have to now, because it's made to fit you. Come, Patty dear,  I've set my heart on your going to that party. You mustn't disappoint  me--you _can't_, for what good would it do? I can never wear the dress  now.\"    Patty realized that. She knew she might as well go to the party, but  she did not feel much pleasure in the prospect. Nevertheless, when she  was ready for it the next evening, she couldn't help a little thrill  of delight. The dress was so pretty, and dainty, and becoming.    \"You look sweet,\" exclaimed Carry admiringly. \"There, I hear the  Browns' carriage. Patty, I want you to promise me this--that you'll  not let any thought of me, or my not going to the wedding, spoil your  enjoyment this evening. I gave you the dress that you might have a  good time, so don't make my gift of no effect.\"    \"I'll try,\" promised Patty, flying downstairs, where her next-door  neighbours were waiting for her.    At two o'clock that night Carry was awakened to see Patty bending over  her, flushed and radiant. Carry sat sleepily up. \"I hope you had a  good time,\" she said.    \"I had--oh, I had--but I didn't waken you out of your hard-earned  slumbers at this wee sma' hour to tell you that. Carry, I've thought  of a way for you to go to the wedding. It just came to me at supper.  Mrs. Forbes was sitting opposite to me, and her dress suggested it.  You must make over Aunt Caroline's silk dress.\"    \"Nonsense,\" said Carry, a little crossly; even sweet-tempered people  are sometimes cross when they are wakened up for--as it  seemed--nothing.    \"It's good plain sense. Of course, you must make it over and--\"    \"Patty Lea, you're crazy. I wouldn't dream of wearing that hideous  thing. Bright green silk, with huge yellow brocade flowers as big as  cabbages all over it! I think I see myself in it.\"    \"Caddy, listen to me. You know there's enough of that black lace of  mother's for the waist, and the big black lace shawl of Grandmother  Lea's will do for the skirt. Make it over--\"    \"A plain slip of the silk,\" gasped Carry, her quick brain seizing on  all the possibilities of the plan. \"Why didn't I think of it before?  It will be just the thing, the greens and yellow will be toned down to  a nice shimmer under the black lace. And I'll make cuffs of black  velvet with double puffs above--and just cut out a wee bit at the  throat with a frill of lace and a band of black velvet ribbon around  my neck. Patty Lea, it's an inspiration.\"    Carry was out of bed by daylight the next morning and, while Patty  still slumbered, she mounted to the garret, and took Aunt Caroline's  silk dress from the chest where it had lain forgotten for three  years. Carry held it up at arm's length, and looked at it with  amusement.    \"It is certainly ugly, but with the lace over it it will look very  different. There's enough of it, anyway, and that skirt is stiff  enough to stand alone. Poor Aunt Caroline, I'm afraid I wasn't  particularly grateful for her gift at the time, but I really am now.\"    Aunt Caroline, who had given the dress to Carry three years before,  was, an old lady of eighty, the aunt of Carry's father. She had once  possessed a snug farm but in an evil hour she had been persuaded to  deed it to her nephew, Edward Curry, whom she had brought up. Poor  Aunt Caroline had lived to regret this step, for everyone in Enderby  knew that Edward Curry and his wife had repaid her with ingratitude  and greed.    Carry, who was named for her, was her favourite grandniece and often  went to see her, though such visits were coldly received by the  Currys, who always took especial care never to leave Aunt Caroline  alone with any of her relatives. On one occasion, when Carry was  there, Aunt Caroline had brought out this silk dress.    \"I'm going to give this to you, Carry,\" she said timidly. \"It's a good  silk, and not so very old. Mr. Greenley gave it to me for a birthday  present fifteen years ago. Maybe you can make it over for yourself.\"    Mrs. Edward, who was on duty at the time, sniffed disagreeably, but  she said nothing. The dress was of no value in her eyes, for the  pattern was so ugly and old-fashioned that none of her smart daughters  would have worn it. Had it been otherwise, Aunt Caroline would  probably not have been allowed to give it away.    Carry had thanked Aunt Caroline sincerely. If she did not care much  for the silk, she at least prized the kindly motive behind the gift.  Perhaps she and Patty laughed a little over it as they packed it away  in the garret. It was so very ugly, but Carry thought it was sweet of  Aunt Caroline to have given her something. Poor old Aunt Caroline had  died soon after, and Carry had not thought about the silk dress again.  She had too many other things to think of, this poor worried Carry.    After breakfast Carry began to rip the skirt breadths apart. Snip,  snip, went her scissors, while her thoughts roamed far afield--now  looking forward with renewed pleasure to Christine's wedding, now  dwelling dolefully on the mortgage. Patty, who was washing the dishes,  knew just what her thoughts were by the light and shadow on her  expressive face.    \"Why!--what?\" exclaimed Carry suddenly. Patty wheeled about to see  Carry staring at the silk dress like one bewitched. Between the silk  and the lining which she had just ripped apart was a twenty-dollar  bill, and beside it a sheet of letter paper covered with writing in a  cramped angular hand, both secured very carefully to the silk.    \"Carry Lea!\" gasped Patty.    With trembling fingers Carry snipped away the stitches that held the  letter, and read it aloud.        \"My dear Caroline,\" it ran, \"I do not know when you will find      this letter and this money, but when you do it belongs to you.      I have a hundred dollars which I always meant to give you      because you were named for me. But Edward and his wife do not      know I have it, and I don't want them to find out. They would      not let me give it to you if they knew, so I have thought of      this way of getting it to you. I have sewed five twenty-dollar      bills under the lining of this skirt, and they are all yours,      with your Aunt Caroline's best love. You were always a good      girl, Carry, and you've worked hard, and I've given Edward      enough. Just take this money and use it as you like.                                       \"Aunt Caroline Greenley.\"      \"Carry Lea, are we both dreaming?\" gasped Patty.    With crimson cheeks Carry ripped the other breadths apart, and there  were the other four bills. Then she slipped down in a little heap on  the sofa cushions and began to cry--happy tears of relief and  gladness.    \"We can pay the interest,\" said Patty, dancing around the room, \"and  get yourself a nice new dress for the wedding.\"    \"Indeed I won't,\" said Carry, sitting up and laughing through her  tears. \"I'll make over this dress and wear it out of gratitude to the  memory of dear Aunt Caroline.\"          Aunt Susanna's Thanksgiving Dinner.    BY L.M. MONTGOMERY      \"Here's Aunt Susanna, girls,\" said Laura who was sitting by the north  window--nothing but north light does for Laura who is the artist of  our talented family.    Each of us has a little pet new-fledged talent which we are faithfully  cultivating in the hope that it will amount to something and soar  highly some day. But it is difficult to cultivate four talents on our  tiny income. If Laura wasn't such a good manager we never could do it.    Laura's words were a signal for Kate to hang up her violin and for me  to push my pen and portfolio out of sight. Laura had hidden her  brushes and water colors as she spoke. Only Margaret continued to bend  serenely over her Latin grammar. Aunt Susanna frowns on musical and  literary and artistic ambitions but she accords a faint approval to  Margaret's desire for an education. A college course, with a tangible  diploma at the end, and a sensible pedagogic aspiration is something  Aunt Susanna can understand when she tries hard. But she cannot  understand messing with paints, fiddling, or scribbling, and she has  only unmeasured contempt for messers, fiddlers, and scribblers. Time  was when we had paid no attention to Aunt Susanna's views on these  points; but ever since she had, on one incautious day when she was in  high good humor, dropped a pale, anemic little hint that she might  send Margaret to college if she were a good girl we had been bending  all our energies towards securing Aunt Susanna's approval. It was not  enough that Aunt Susanna should approve of Margaret; she must approve  of the whole four of us or she would not help Margaret. That is Aunt  Susanna's way. Of late we had been growing a little discouraged. Aunt  Susanna had recently read a magazine article which stated that the  higher education of women was ruining our country and that a woman who  was a B.A. couldn't, in the very nature of things, ever be a  housewifely, cookly creature. Consequently, Margaret's chances looked  a little foggy; but we hadn't quite given up hope. A very little thing  might sway Aunt Susanna one way or the other, so that we walked very  softly and tried to mingle serpents' wisdom and doves' harmlessness in  practical portions.    When Aunt Susanna came in Laura was crocheting, Kate was sewing, and I  was poring over a recipe book. That was not deception at all, since we  did all these things frequently--much more frequently, in fact, than  we painted or fiddled or wrote. But Aunt Susanna would never believe  it. Nor did she believe it now.    She threw back her lovely new sealskin cape, looked around the  sitting-room and then smiled--a truly Aunt Susannian smile.

Alec lived a long while after, but he never married  again. He's gone now, and nobody remembers Mercedes but me.\"    Abel lapsed into a reverie--a tryst with the past which I would not  disturb. I thought he did not notice my departure, but as I opened the  gate he stood up and waved his hand.    Three days later I went again to the old garden by the harbour shore.  There was a red light on a distant sail. In the far west a sunset city  was built around a great deep harbour of twilight. Palaces were there  and bannered towers of crimson and gold. The air was full of music;  there was one music of the wind and another of the waves, and still  another of the distant bell from the chapel near which Mercedes slept.  The garden was full of ripe odours and warm colours. The Lombardies  around it were tall and sombre like the priestly forms of some mystic  band. Abel was sitting in the hop-vine arbour; beside him Captain  Kidd slept. I thought Abel was asleep, too; his head leaned against  the trellis and his eyes were shut.    But when I reached the arbour I saw that he was not asleep. There was  a strange, wise little smile on his lips as if he had attained to the  ultimate wisdom and were laughing in no unkindly fashion at our old  blind suppositions and perplexities.    Abel had gone on his Great Adventure.            Akin To Love      David Hartley had dropped in to pay a neighbourly call on Josephine  Elliott. It was well along in the afternoon, and outside, in the clear  crispness of a Canadian winter, the long blue shadows from the tall  firs behind the house were falling over the snow.    It was a frosty day, and all the windows of every room where there was  no fire were covered with silver palms. But the big, bright kitchen  was warm and cosy, and somehow seemed to David more tempting than ever  before, and that is saying a good deal. He had an uneasy feeling that  he had stayed long enough and ought to go. Josephine was knitting at a  long gray sock with doubly aggressive energy, and that was a sign that  she was talked out. As long as Josephine had plenty to say, her plump  white fingers, where her mother's wedding ring was lost in dimples,  moved slowly among her needles. When conversation flagged she fell to  her work as furiously as if a husband and half a dozen sons were  waiting for its completion. David often wondered in his secret soul  what Josephine did with all the interminable gray socks she knitted.  Sometimes he concluded that she put them in the home missionary  barrels; again, that she sold them to her hired man. At any rate, they  were very warm and comfortable looking, and David sighed as he thought  of the deplorable state his own socks were generally in.    When David sighed Josephine took alarm. She was afraid David was going  to have one of his attacks of foolishness. She must head him off  someway, so she rolled up the gray sock, stabbed the big pudgy ball  with her needles, and said she guessed she'd get the tea.    David got up.    \"Now, you're not going before tea?\" said Josephine hospitably. \"I'll  have it all ready in no time.\"    \"I ought to go home, I s'pose,\" said David, with the air and tone of a  man dallying with a great temptation. \"Zillah'll be waiting tea for  me; and there's the stock to tend to.\"    \"I guess Zillah won't wait long,\" said Josephine. She did not intend  it at all, but there was a certain scornful ring in her voice. \"You  must stay. I've a fancy for company to tea.\"    David sat down again. He looked so pleased that Josephine went down on  her knees behind the stove, ostensibly to get a stick of firewood, but  really to hide her smile.    \"I suppose he's tickled to death to think of getting a good square  meal, after the starvation rations Zillah puts him on,\" she thought.    But Josephine misjudged David just as much as he misjudged her. She  had really asked him to stay to tea out of pity, but David thought it  was because she was lonesome, and he hailed that as an encouraging  sign. And he was not thinking about getting a good meal either,  although his dinner had been such a one as only Zillah Hartley could  get up. As he leaned back in his cushioned chair and watched Josephine  bustling about the kitchen, he was glorying in the fact that he could  spend another hour with her, and sit opposite to her at the table  while she poured his tea for him and passed him the biscuits, just as  if--just as if--    Here Josephine looked straight at him with such intent and stern brown  eyes that David felt she must have read his thoughts, and he colored  guiltily. But Josephine did not even notice that he was blushing. She  had only paused to wonder whether she would bring out cherry or  strawberry preserve; and, having decided on the cherry, took her  piercing gaze from David without having seen him at all. But he  allowed his thoughts no more vagaries.    Josephine set the table with her mother's wedding china. She used it  because it was the anniversary of her mother's wedding day, but David  thought it was out of compliment to him. And, as he knew quite well  that Josephine prized that china beyond all her other earthly  possessions, he stroked his smooth-shaven, dimpled chin with the air  of a man to whom is offered a very subtly sweet homage.    Josephine whisked in and out of the pantry, and up and down cellar,  and with every whisk a new dainty was added to the table. Josephine,  as everybody in Meadowby admitted, was past mistress in the noble art  of cookery. Once upon a time rash matrons and ambitious young wives  had aspired to rival her, but they had long ago realised the vanity of  such efforts and dropped comfortably back to second place.    Josephine felt an artist's pride in her table when she set the teapot  on its stand and invited David to sit in. There were pink slices of  cold tongue, and crisp green pickles and spiced gooseberry, the recipe  for which Josephine had invented herself, and which had taken first  prize at the Provincial Exhibition for six successive years; there was  a lemon pie which was a symphony in gold and silver, biscuits as light  and white as snow, and moist, plummy cubes of fruit cake. There was  the ruby-tinted cherry preserve, a mound of amber jelly, and, to crown  all, steaming cups of tea, in flavour and fragrance unequalled.    And Josephine, too, sitting at the head of the table, with her smooth,  glossy crimps of black hair and cheeks as rosy clear as they had been  twenty years ago, when she had been a slender slip of girlhood and  bashful young David Hartley had looked at her over his hymn-book in  prayer-meeting and tramped all the way home a few feet behind her,  because he was too shy to go boldly up and ask if he might see her  home.    All taken together, what wonder if David lost his head over that  tea-table and determined to ask Josephine the same old question once  more? It was eighteen years since he had asked it for the first time,  and two years since the last. He would try his luck again; Josephine  was certainly more gracious than he remembered her to ever have been  before.    When the meal was over Josephine cleared the table and washed the  dishes. When she had taken a dry towel and sat down by the window to  polish her china David understood that his opportunity had come. He  moved over and sat down beside her on the sofa by the window.    Outside the sun was setting in a magnificent arch of light and colour  over the snow-clad hills and deep blue St. Lawrence gulf. David  grasped at the sunset as an introductory factor.    \"Isn't that fine, Josephine?\" he said admiringly. \"It makes me think  of that piece of poetry that used to be in the old Fifth Reader when  we went to school. D'ye mind how the teacher used to drill us up in it  on Friday afternoons? It begun        'Slow sinks more lovely ere his race is run      Along Morea's hills the setting sun.'\"    Then David declaimed the whole passage in a sing-song tone,  accompanied by a few crude gestures recalled from long-ago school-boy  elocution. Josephine knew what was coming. Every time David proposed  to her he had begun by reciting poetry. She twirled her towel around  the last plate resignedly. If it had to come, the sooner it was over  the better. Josephine knew by experience that there was no heading  David off, despite his shyness, when he had once got along as far as  the poetry.    \"But it's going to be for the last time,\" she said determinedly. \"I'm  going to settle this question so decidedly to-night that there'll  never be a repetition.\"    When David had finished his quotation he laid his hand on Josephine's  plump arm.    \"Josephine,\" he said huskily, \"I s'pose you couldn't--could you  now?--make up your mind to have me. I wish you would, Josephine--I  wish you would. Don't you think you could, Josephine?\"    Josephine folded up her towel, crossed her hands on it, and looked her  wooer squarely in the eyes.    \"David Hartley,\" she said deliberately, \"what makes you go on asking  me to marry you every once in a while when I've told you times out of  mind that I can't and won't?\"    \"Because I can't help hoping that you'll change your mind through  time,\" David replied meekly.    \"Well, you just listen to me. I will not marry you. That is in the  first place. And in the second, this is to be final. It has to be. You  are never to ask me this again under any circumstances. If you do I  will not answer you--I will not let on I hear you at all; but (and  Josephine spoke very slowly and impressively) I will never speak to  you again--never. We are good friends now, and I like you real well,  and like to have you drop in for a neighbourly chat as often as you  wish to, but there'll be an end, short and sudden, to that, if you  don't mind what I say.\"    \"Oh, Josephine, ain't that rather hard?\" protested David feebly. It  seemed terrible to be cut off from all hope with such finality as"]]]
