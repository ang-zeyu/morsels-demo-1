The school authorities took no  pains to scrutinise these letters, they knew it would be all the same  whether we attended or not, so far as educational results were  concerned.    I have now a school of my own in which the boys are up to all kinds of  mischief, for boys will be mischievous--and schoolmasters unforgiving.  When any of us are beset with undue uneasiness at their conduct and are  stirred into a resolution to deal out condign punishment, the misdeeds  of my own schooldays confront me in a row and smile at me.    I now clearly see that the mistake is to judge boys by the standard of  grown-ups, to forget that a child is quick and mobile like a running  stream; and that, in the case of such, any touch of imperfection need  cause no great alarm, for the speed of the flow is itself the best  corrective. When stagnation sets in then comes the danger. So it is for  the teacher, more than the pupil, to beware of wrongdoing.    There was a separate refreshment room for Bengali boys for meeting their  caste requirements. This was where we struck up a friendship with some  of the others. They were all older than we. One of these will bear to be  dilated upon.    His specialty was the art of Magic, so much so that he had actually  written and published a little booklet on it, the front page of which  bore his name with the title of Professor. I had never before come  across a schoolboy whose name had appeared in print, so that my  reverence for him--as a professor of magic I mean--was profound. How  could I have brought myself to believe that anything questionable could  possibly find place in the straight and upright ranks of printed  letters? To be able to record one's own words in indelible ink--was  that a slight thing? To stand unscreened yet unabashed, self-confessed  before the world,--how could one withhold belief in the face of such  supreme self-confidence? I remember how once I got the types for the  letters of my name from some printing press, and what a memorable thing  it seemed when I inked and pressed them on paper and found my name  imprinted.    We used to give a lift in our carriage to this schoolfellow and  author-friend of ours. This led to visiting terms. He was also great at  theatricals. With his help we erected a stage on our wrestling ground  with painted paper stretched over a split bamboo framework. But a  peremptory negative from upstairs prevented any play from being acted  thereon.    A comedy of errors was however played later on without any stage at all.  The author of this has already been introduced to the reader in these  pages. He was none other than my nephew Satya. Those who behold his  present calm and sedate demeanour would be shocked to learn of the  tricks of which he was the originator.    [Illustration: Satya]    The event of which I am writing happened sometime afterwards when I was  twelve or thirteen. Our magician friend had told of so many strange  properties of things that I was consumed with curiosity to see them for  myself. But the materials of which he spoke were invariably so rare  or distant that one could hardly hope to get hold of them without the  help of Sindbad the sailor. Once, as it happened, the Professor forgot  himself so far as to mention accessible things. Who could ever believe  that a seed dipped and dried twenty-one times in the juice of a species  of cactus would sprout and flower and fruit all in the space of an hour?  I was determined to test this, not daring withal to doubt the assurance  of a Professor whose name appeared in a printed book.    I got our gardener to furnish me with a plentiful supply of the milky  juice, and betook myself, on a Sunday afternoon, to our mystic nook in a  corner of the roof terrace, to experiment with the stone of a mango. I  was wrapt in my task of dipping and drying--but the grown-up reader will  probably not wait to ask me the result. In the meantime, I little knew  that Satya, in another corner, had, in the space of an hour, caused to  root and sprout a mystical plant of his own creation. This was to bear  curious fruit later on.    After the day of this experiment the Professor rather avoided me, as I  gradually came to perceive. He would not sit on the same side in the  carriage, and altogether seemed to fight shy of me.    One day, all of a sudden, he proposed that each one in turn should jump  off the bench in our schoolroom. He wanted to observe the differences  in style, he said. Such scientific curiosity did not appear queer in a  professor of magic. Everyone jumped, so did I. He shook his head with a  subdued \"h'm.\" No amount of persuasion could draw anything further out  of him.    Another day he informed us that some good friends of his wanted to make  our acquaintance and asked us to accompany him to their house. Our  guardians had no objection, so off we went. The crowd in the room seemed  full of curiosity. They expressed their eagerness to hear me sing. I  sang a song or two. Mere child as I was I could hardly have bellowed  like a bull. \"Quite a sweet voice,\" they all agreed.    When refreshments were put before us they sat round and watched us eat.  I was bashful by nature and not used to strange company; moreover the  habit I acquired during the attendance of our servant Iswar left me a  poor eater for good. They all seemed impressed with the delicacy of my  appetite.    In the fifth act I got some curiously warm letters from our Professor  which revealed the whole situation. And here let the curtain fall.    I subsequently learnt from Satya that while I had been practising magic  on the mango seed, he had successfully convinced the Professor that I  was dressed as a boy by our guardians merely for getting me a better  schooling, but that really this was only a disguise. To those who are  curious in regard to imaginary science I should explain that a girl is  supposed to jump with her left foot forward, and this is what I had done  on the occasion of the Professor's trial. I little realised at the time  what a tremendously false step mine had been!          (13) _My Father_      Shortly after my birth my father took to constantly travelling about. So  it is no exaggeration to say that in my early childhood I hardly knew  him. He would now and then come back home all of a sudden, and with him  came foreign servants with whom I felt extremely eager to make friends.  Once there came in this way a young Panjabi servant named Lenu. The  cordiality of the reception he got from us would have been worthy of  Ranjit Singh himself. Not only was he a foreigner, but a Panjabi to  boot,--what wonder he stole our hearts away?    We had the same reverence for the whole Panjabi nation as for Bhima and  Arjuna of the Mahabharata. They were warriors; and if they had  sometimes fought and lost, that was clearly the enemy's fault. It was  glorious to have Lenu, of the Panjab, in our very home.    My sister-in-law had a model war-ship under a glass case, which, when  wound up, rocked on blue-painted silken waves to the tinkling of a  musical box. I would beg hard for the loan of this to display its  marvels to the admiring Lenu.    Caged in the house as we were, anything savouring of foreign parts had a  peculiar charm for me. This was one of the reasons why I made so much of  Lenu. This was also the reason why Gabriel, the Jew, with his  embroidered gaberdine, who came to sell _attars_ and scented oils,  stirred me so; and the huge Kabulis, with their dusty, baggy trousers  and knapsacks and bundles, wrought on my young mind a fearful  fascination.    Anyhow, when my father came, we would be content with wandering round  about his entourage and in the company of his servants. We did not reach  his immediate presence.    Once while my father was away in the Himalayas, that old bogey of the  British Government, the Russian invasion, came to be a subject of  agitated conversation among the people. Some well-meaning lady friend  had enlarged on the impending danger to my mother with all the  circumstance of a prolific imagination. How could a body tell from  which of the Tibetan passes the Russian host might suddenly flash forth  like a baleful comet?    My mother was seriously alarmed. Possibly the other members of the  family did not share her misgivings; so, despairing of grown-up  sympathy, she sought my boyish support. \"Won't you write to your father  about the Russians?\" she asked.    That letter, carrying the tidings of my mother's anxieties, was my first  one to my father. I did not know how to begin or end a letter, or  anything at all about it. I went to Mahananda, the estate munshi.[19]  The resulting style of address was doubtless correct enough, but the  sentiments could not have escaped the musty flavour inseparable from  literature emanating from an estate office.    I got a reply to my letter. My father asked me not to be afraid; if the  Russians came he would drive them away himself. This confident assurance  did not seem to have the effect of relieving my mother's fears, but it  served to free me from all timidity as regards my father. After that I  wanted to write to him every day and pestered Mahananda accordingly.  Unable to withstand my importunity he would make out drafts for me to  copy. But I did not know that there was the postage to be paid for. I  had an idea that letters placed in Mahananda's hands got to their  destination without any need for further worry. It is hardly necessary  to mention that, Mahananda being considerably older than myself, these  letters never reached the Himalayan hill-tops.    When, after his long absences, my father came home even for a few days,  the whole house seemed filled with the weight of his presence. We would  see our elders at certain hours, formally robed in their _chogas_,  passing to his rooms with restrained gait and sobered mien, casting away  any _pan_[20] they might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#9)"],[1,"  in the distant city, and the sheik said shortly, \"We will wait till we  see what is going to be done.\" Presently two or three Arabs were seen  galloping across the cultivated ground. They belonged to the Henedy  tribe, one of the wildest and most savage of the people of the desert.  When they saw the group of horses they made their way towards them. As  the sheik advanced a few paces, one of them leapt from his saddle and  came up to him.    \"What has happened, brother?\" Ben Ouafy asked.    \"Last evening the Franks began to land, and all night they continued to  come ashore. At midnight Koraim, the commander of the town, went out to  see what they were doing, at the head of twenty Mamelukes, and fell upon  a company of their skirmishers, charged them, killed many, and carried  the head of their captain in triumph into the town. At five this morning  our tribe arrived. We rode up near them, and saw that they had neither  horsemen nor cannon. They were divided into three columns, and were  marching towards the town. We dashed in between the columns and cut down  many of their skirmishers, but we were only five hundred, and dared not  attack the column, which opened such a heavy fire that we were forced to  draw off. Our sheik ordered us to ride south to carry the news to  Ramanieb that the Franks had landed. They may have sent the news from  the town, but he thought it best to make sure.\"    \"'Tis well!\" the sheik said, and the Arab threw himself into the saddle  again, and with his companions rode south at a gallop. \"You see,\" the  sheik went on to Edgar, \"the Franks cannot mean to attack the town. What  could they do without cannon?\"    \"It would assuredly be a desperate enterprise, sheik, but I think that  they may attempt it, seeing that it is all-important to them to obtain  possession of the port before our fleet can return.\"    The party remained sitting, with the patience of their race, until the  sheik should give orders for them to mount. Edgar got up several times,  and walked backwards and forwards. He was less accustomed to waiting,  and was burning for action. Just at eight o'clock there came suddenly to  their ears an outburst of firing, the boom of cannon, and the sound of a  crackling roll of musketry.    \"The French have lost no time in beginning,\" he said.    The young Arab nodded. A flush of excitement glowed through the olive  skin, his hand tightly grasped his spear, and his eyes were fixed on the  distant city. Suddenly the sheik raised the vibrating battle-cry of the  Arabs, in which the whole of his followers joined, and then at a wild  gallop they dashed forward, the horses seeming to share in the  excitement of their riders. After maintaining the pace for a couple of  miles they reined in their horses somewhat, and at a canter swept along  the neck that divided in old time the lakes of Aboukir and Mareotis,  slackened down into a walk as they approached the fresh-water canal,  where they stopped for a few minutes to allow their horses to drink, and  then continued at a leisurely pace until they mounted the high ground at  Ramleh. From here they obtained a view of the eastern side of  Alexandria. They could hear the din of battle on the other side of the  town, and could see the great fleet anchored, a mile from shore, some  two miles to the west of the town. The wind, which had been blowing  strongly the night before, and had seriously hindered the work of  disembarkation of the French troops, had now subsided. Some of the  men-of-war were engaging the forts, but at so great a distance that it  was evident that it was a demonstration to distract the attention of the  besieged rather than a serious attack. Four or five ships, under the  shortest sail, were cruising backwards and forwards parallel with the  shore eastward of the town, and occasionally a white puff of smoke burst  out from one or other of them, and a shot was sent in the direction of  scattered bands of horsemen near the shore.    After gazing at the scene in silence for some minutes, the sheik turned  his horse and rode back to a spot near the canal, where the moisture,  permeating through its banks, had given growth to a luxuriant crop of  grass. Here all dismounted and tethered their horses. Four of the Arabs  were appointed to watch over their safety, and the rest reascended the  mound, and squatted down on the sands. Gradually the other parties of  horse gathered there, and the sheiks gravely consulted together. All had  a conviction that Alexandria would hold out until help came from Cairo.  The question of entering the town was discussed. Presently the sound of  cannon ceased, but the rattle of musketry continued unabated.    \"Why have the guns ceased firing, think you?\" the sheik asked Edgar.    \"It is one of two things, sheik. Either the French have got so close up  to the walls that the cannon can no longer be brought to fire upon them,  or they have stormed the walls and the fighting is now in the streets of  the town.\"    \"But there are two walls,\" the sheik said; \"the one known as the Arab  wall, and the inner defences. It is impossible that they can have  carried both.\"    \"It would seem so,\" Edgar agreed; \"but as the musketry is as hot, or  hotter, than ever, it is evident that fighting is going on at close  quarters, and that either the guns cannot be fired, or they have been  captured. You see the walls were in many places weak, and the attempts  that have been made during the past three or four days to repair the  breaches that existed were very incompletely done. I am very much afraid  that it is as I said, and that the French have gained an entrance.\"    Half an hour later, a number of horsemen, followed by a crowd of people  on foot, poured out from the eastern gate. One of the leading horsemen  drew rein for a moment as he passed the group of Arabs.    \"The town is lost,\" he said; \"the Franks have won their way into the  streets, and Koraim has surrendered.\"    An exclamation of fury broke from the Arabs.    \"It will be our turn next,\" Ben Ouafy said, shaking his spear towards  the city. \"This is but the beginning of the work. They may take a city,  but the sands will devour them.\"    As they knew that the French had no cavalry the Arabs remained quiet;  the stream of fugitives continued to pour past them, men, women, and  children.    \"We will return,\" Ben Ouafy said at last. \"We will move south and join  the rest of the tribe, and then see what the government of Cairo are  going to do.\"    The capture of the town had not been effected without loss. Menou's  column had attacked on the right, Kleber in the centre, Bon had moved  round south of the town. The Arab wall was obstinately defended, Kleber  and Menou were both wounded as they led the grenadiers to the assault;  Bon, however, had met with less resistance, and had captured the inner  wall before the other columns succeeded in doing so. For some time the  battle had raged in the streets, but the captain of a Turkish vessel had  been sent by Napoleon to the governor, pointing out that further  resistance would bring destruction upon the town, while if he yielded,  the French troops, who came as friends to deliver them from the tyranny  of the Mamelukes, would do no harm to anyone. Koraim thereupon  capitulated. He was at once attached to the general staff, and charged  with maintaining order in the town and disarming its inhabitants.    Proclamations were at once sent out through the country, declaring that  the French had come to destroy the Mameluke domination, and that they  were friends of the Sultan of Turkey. Protection was offered to all the  villages that submitted; those that did not do so would be burnt. Seven  hundred Turkish slaves, who had been delivered at the capture of Malta,  and who had been extremely well treated, were at once sent to their  homes in Tripoli, Algiers, Morocco, Syria, Smyrna, and Constantinople,  being provided with ample sums of money to support them on their way.  These measures had an excellent effect. Koraim sent out messengers to  the Arab tribes of the neighbourhood. His influence among them was  great, and their sheiks for the most part went at once into Alexandria,  and agreed to keep the road open from Alexandria to Damanhour, and to  sell and deliver within forty-eight hours 300 horses, 500 dromedaries,  and 1000 camels. They were presented with dresses of honour and money.  By this time the transports had all entered the old port of Alexandria,  and were busy discharging their cargo and the troops they carried, and  in a short time the whole French army was on shore.    Scarce a word was spoken among Ben Ouafy's party on their homeward ride.  The sheik gave his orders on his arrival.    \"We will wait for a day or two,\" he said to Edgar as they dismounted.  \"The French have no cavalry, and would not come out here. Let us see  what the other tribes are going to do; we are but a small body.\"    When, two days later, a messenger arrived from Koraim, the sheik, after  reading the contents of the proclamation, indignantly tore it in pieces.    \"Tell Koraim,\" he said to the messenger, \"that hitherto I have regarded  him as an honourable man, now I spit upon him as a traitor. Whatever  others may do, I will fight against the Franks till the last.\"    As soon as the messenger had departed, he gave orders for the tents to  be struck.    \"We must be going, Sidi,\" he said; \"some of the tribes may be taken in  by these promises, and may give aid to the enemy; in that case they  would doubtless obey orders to attack those who refuse to do so. Three  of them can each put four or five hundred spears into the field. We will  move away at once. With fifty men we cannot fight two thousand.\"    The process of packing-up occupied but a short time. As soon as the  tents were made into bundles the thirty camels were brought in and  loaded. The women and children took their places on the top of the  baggage, and then"]]]
