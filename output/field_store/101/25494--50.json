With anxious eye he wandered o'er                               90    Mountain and meadow, moss and moor,    And pondered refuge from his toil,    By far Lochard or Aberfoyle.    But nearer was the copsewood grey,    That waved and wept on Loch-Achray,                             95    And mingled with the pine-trees blue    On the bold cliffs of Benvenue.    Fresh vigor with the hope returned,    With flying foot the heath he spurned,    Held westward with unwearied race,                             100    And left behind the panting chase.      VI      'Twere long to tell what steeds gave o'er,    As swept the hunt through Cambusmore;    What reins were tightened in despair,    When rose Benledi's ridge in air;                              105    Who flagged upon Bochastle's heath,    Who shunned to stem the flooded Teith--    For twice that day, from shore to shore,    The gallant stag swam stoutly o'er.    Few were the stragglers, following far,                        110    That reached the lake of Vennachar;    And when the Brigg of Turk was won,    The headmost horseman rode alone.      VII      Alone, but with unbated zeal,    That horseman plied the scourge and steel;                     115    For jaded now, and spent with toil,    Embossed with foam, and dark with soil,    While every gasp with sobs he drew,    The laboring stag strained full in view.    Two dogs of black Saint Hubert's breed,                        120    Unmatched for courage, breath, and speed,    Fast on his flying traces came,    And all but won that desperate game;    For, scarce a spear's length from his haunch,    Vindictive, toiled the bloodhounds stanch;                     125    Nor nearer might the dogs attain,    Nor farther might the quarry strain.    Thus up the margin of the lake,    Between the precipice and brake,    O'er stock and rock their race they take.                      130      VIII      The Hunter marked that mountain high,    The lone lake's western boundary,    And deemed the stag must turn to bay,    Where that huge rampart barred the way;    Already glorying in the prize,                                 135    Measured his antlers with his eyes;    For the death-wound and the death-halloo,    Mustered his breath, his whinyard drew--    But thundering as he came prepared,    With ready arm and weapon bared,                               140    The wily quarry shunned the shock,    And turned him from the opposing rock;    Then, dashing down a darksome glen,    Soon lost to hound and Hunter's ken,    In the deep Trossachs' wildest nook                            145    His solitary refuge took.    There, while close couched, the thicket shed    Cold dews and wild-flowers on his head,    He heard the baffled dogs in vain    Rave through the hollow pass amain,                            150    Chiding the rocks that yelled again.      IX      Close on the hounds the Hunter came,    To cheer them on the vanished game;    But, stumbling in the rugged dell,    The gallant horse exhausted fell.                              155    The impatient rider strove in vain    To rouse him with the spur and rein,    For the good steed, his labors o'er,    Stretched his stiff limbs, to rise no more;    Then, touched with pity and remorse,                           160    He sorrowed o'er the expiring horse.    \"I little thought, when first thy rein    I slacked upon the banks of Seine,    That Highland eagle e'er should feed    On thy fleet limbs, my matchless steed!                        165    Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day,    That costs thy life, my gallant gray!\"      X      Then through the dell his horn resounds,    From vain pursuit to call the hounds.    Back limped, with slow and crippled pace,                      170    The sulky leaders of the chase;    Close to their master's side they pressed,    With drooping tail and humbled crest;    But still the dingle's hollow throat    Prolonged the swelling bugle-note.                             175    The owlets started from their dream,    The eagles answered with their scream,    Round and around the sounds were cast,    Till echo seemed an answering blast;    And on the Hunter hied his way,                                180    To join some comrades of the day;    Yet often paused, so strange the road,    So wondrous were the scenes it showed.      XI      The western waves of ebbing day    Rolled o'er the glen their level way;                          185    Each purple peak, each flinty spire,    Was bathed in floods of living fire.    But not a setting beam could glow    Within the dark ravines below,    Where twined the path in shadow hid,                           190    Round many a rocky pyramid,    Shooting abruptly from the dell    Its thunder-splintered pinnacle;    Round many an insulated mass,    The native bulwarks of the pass,                               195    Huge as the tower which builders vain    Presumptuous piled on Shinar's plain.    The rocky summits, split and rent,    Formed turret, dome, or battlement,    Or seemed fantastically set                                    200    With cupola or minaret,    Wild crests as pagod ever decked,    Or mosque of Eastern architect.    Nor were these earth-born castles bare,    Nor lacked they many a banner fair;                            205    For, from their shivered brows displayed,    Far o'er the unfathomable glade,    All twinkling with the dewdrops sheen,    The brier-rose fell in streamers green,    And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes,                         210    Waved in the west-wind's summer sighs.      XII      Boon nature scattered, free and wild,    Each plant or flower, the mountain's child.    Here eglantine embalmed the air,    Hawthorn and hazel mingled there;                              215    The primrose pale and violet flower,    Found in each cliff a narrow bower;    Fox-glove and night-shade, side by side,    Emblems of punishment and pride,    Grouped their dark hues with every stain                       220    The weather-beaten crags retain.    With boughs that quaked at every breath,    Grey birch and aspen wept beneath;    Aloft, the ash and warrior oak    Cast anchor in the rifted rock;                                225    And, higher yet, the pine-tree hung    His shattered trunk, and frequent flung,    Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high,    His bows athwart the narrowed sky.    Highest of all, where white peaks glanced,                     230    Where glist'ning streamers waved and danced,    The wanderer's eye could barely view    The summer heaven's delicious blue;    So wondrous wild, the whole might seem    The scenery of a fairy dream.                                  235      XIII      Onward, amid the copse 'gan peep    A narrow inlet, still and deep,    Affording scarce such breadth of brim    As served the wild duck's brood to swim.    Lost for a space, through thickets veering,                    240    But broader when again appearing,    Tall rocks and tufted knolls their face    Could on the dark-blue mirror trace;    And farther as the Hunter strayed,    Still broader sweep its channels made.                         245    The shaggy mounds no longer stood,    Emerging from entangled wood,    But, wave-encircled, seemed to float,    Like castle girdled with its moat;    Yet broader floods extending still                             250    Divide them from their parent hill,    Till each, retiring, claims to be    An islet in an inland sea.      XIV      And now, to issue from the glen,    No pathway meets the wanderer's ken,                           255    Unless he climb, with footing nice,    A far projecting precipice.    The broom's tough roots his ladder made,    The hazel saplings lent their aid;    And thus an airy point he won,                                 260    Where, gleaming with the setting sun,    One burnished sheet of living gold,    Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled,    In all her length far winding lay,    With promontory, creek, and bay,                               265    And island that, empurpled bright,    Floated amid the livelier light,    And mountains, that like giants stand,    To sentinel enchanted land.    High on the south, huge Benvenue                               270    Down on the lake in masses threw    Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly hurled,    The fragments of an earlier world;    A wildering forest feathered o'er    His ruined sides and summit hoar,                              275    While on the north, through middle air,    Ben-an heaved high his forehead bare.      XV      From the steep promontory gazed    The stranger, raptured and amazed,    And, \"What a scene were here,\" he cried,                       280    \"For princely pomp, or churchman's pride!    On this bold brow, a lordly tower;    In that soft vale, a lady's bower;    On yonder meadow, far away,    The turrets of a cloister gray;                                285    How blithely might the bugle-horn    Chide, on the lake, the lingering morn!    How sweet, at eve, the lover's lute    Chime, when the groves were still and mute!    And when the midnight moon should lave                         290    Her forehead in the silver wave,    How solemn on the ear would come    The holy matin's distant hum,    While the deep peal's commanding tone    Should wake, in yonder islet lone,                             295    A sainted hermit from his cell,    To drop a bead with every knell--    And bugle, lute, and bell, and all,    Should each bewildered stranger call    To friendly feast, and lighted hall.                           300      XVI      \"Blithe were it then to wander here!    But now--beshrew yon nimble deer--    Like that same hermit's, thin and spare,    The copse must give my evening fare;    Some mossy bank "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28297"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, May, 1880 (#9)"],[1,"whose better days had  been one continued scene of debauch. His only nourishment was milk punch,  in which he indulged to the full extent of his weak state. He had partaken  very recently of it, as the sides and corners of his mouth exhibited very  unequivocal traces of it, as well as of blood which had also followed in  the track and left its mark on the pillow. Upon their making known the  object of their visit, Paine interrupted the speaker by saying, 'That's  enough, sir, that's enough. I see what you would be about. I wish to hear  no more from you, sir; my mind is made up on that subject. I look upon the  whole of the Christian scheme to be a tissue of lies, and Jesus Christ to  be nothing more than a cunning knave and imposter. Away with you, and your  God, too! Leave the room instantly! All that you have uttered are lies,  filthy lies, and if I had a little more time I would prove it, as I did  about your imposter, Jesus Christ.' Among the last utterances that fell  upon the ears of the attendants of this dying infidel, and which have been  recorded in history, were the words, 'My God, my God, why hast thou  forsaken me?' \"                      -------------------------------------    \"Some thousand famous writers come up in this century to be forgotten in  the next. But the silver cord of the Bible is not loosened, nor its golden  bowl broken, though time chronicles his tens of centuries passed by....  You can trace the path of the Bible across the world, from the day of  Pentecost to this day. As a river springs up in the heart of a sandy  continent, having its father in the skies; as the stream rolls on, making  in that arid waste a belt of verdure wherever it turns its way; creating  palm groves and fertile plains, where the smoke of the cottage curls up at  eventide, and marble cities send the gleam of their splendor far into die  sky--such has been the course of the bible on earth.\"--_Theodore Parker._    \"I must die--abandoned of God and of men.\"--_Voltaire._            THREE REASONS FOR REPUDIATING INFIDELITY.      Bishop Whipple says, \"I once met a thoughtful scholar who told me that for  years he had read every book which assailed the religion of Jesus Christ.  He said he would have been an infidel if it had not been for three things:    \" 'First, I am a man. I am going somewhere. I am to-night a day nearer the  grave than last night. I have read all that they can tell me. There is not  one solitary ray of light upon the darkness. They shall not take away the  only guide and leave me stone blind.    \" 'Secondly, I had a mother. I saw her go down into the dark valley where  I am going, and she leaned upon an unseen arm as calmly as a child goes to  sleep upon the breast of a mother. I know that was not a dream.    \" 'Thirdly, I have three motherless daughters. They have no protector but  myself. I would rather kill them than leave them in this sinful world if  you could blot out from it all the teachings of the Gospel.' \"            COL. INGERSOLL IS A PHILOSOPHER?      Col. Ingersoll tells us that \"intellectual liberty, as a matter of  necessity, forever destroys the idea that belief is either PRAISE OR  BLAMEWORTHY, and is wholly inconsistent with every creed in Christendom.\"  Again, he says, \"No man can control his belief.\" Notwithstanding all this,  his whole occupation consists in traveling over the country and blaming  men, women and children for their belief. He is consistent? He is a  Scientist, you know? He does nothing that is absurd? He is a philosopher,  sitting on the bones of Moses and making grimaces at the faith of Moses,  when neither Moses nor his friends could control their belief? He works  hard for no purpose if men can't control their belief, and does men  injustice, IF HE BLAMES THEM FOR THEIR FAITH?    \"No man can control his belief.\" Then why labor to make your brother of  humanity believe that he is but--              The pilgrim of a day?      Spouse of the worm and brother of the clay,      Frail as the leaf in autumn's yellow bower,      Dust in the wind, or dew upon the flower?            A child without a sire;      Whose mortal life and transitory fire      Light to the grave his chance-created form,      As ocean wrecks illuminate the storm.      And then--          To-night, and silence sinks forevermore!      If these--          The pompous teachings ye proclaim,      Lights of the world and demi-gods of fame,      The laurel wreaths that murderers rear,      Blood-nursed and watered by the widow's tears,      Seems not so foul, so tainted, and so dread,      As the daily night-shade round the skeptic's head.      _Think of Ingersoll at his brother's grave!_            LIFE OF ELDER E.
