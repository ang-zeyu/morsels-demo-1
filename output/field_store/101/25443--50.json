It is issued by the Committee of the  written Monuments of the History of France, and the Committee of Arts  and Monuments. The most eminent names of French science and literature  are among the contributors to these works.           *       *       *       *       *    M. GINOUX, who was sent by Guizot on a scientific mission which required  him to traverse the globe, but who was recalled by the government of  General Cavaignac, has returned to Paris, having been absent several  years. He will soon publish the narrative of his travels, which have  been in Oceanica, Polynesia, Brazil, Patagonia, Chili, Bolivia, Peru,  Equador, New Grenada, Jamaica, Cuba, and the United States.           *       *       *       *       *    BERANGER, at the last dates was, and for several weeks had been,  dangerously ill, at his house at Passy.           *       *       *       *       *    VERON, the editor of the Paris _Constitutionnel_, is a transcendent  specimen of the voluptuary. He is a large, fleshy, sensual, though by no  means coarse-looking man, with the marks of high living and animal  enjoyment on all his features. He first made a fortune by selling a  quack medicine, after which he became proprietor of the  _Constitutionnel_. His paper is conducted on the quack medicine  principle, with a shrewd view to the profits, and represents the  ultra-conservative side on all public questions. Latterly Veron has made  an arrangement with Louis Napoleon, by which it has become in some sort  the special organ of that functionary. This has made the editor doubly  famous, and in consequence of the crowd desiring to see him which  surrounded the Cafe de Paris, where he had long dined regularly every  day, he has been compelled to abandon that elegant establishment, and  set up a table for himself. He has done this in a princely manner, and  from his position, and the Apicius-like dinners which he gives, finds no  difficulty in assembling at his daily banquets the elite of Parisian  _viveurs_. Among his guests are M. Roqueplan, of the opera; M. Scribe,  the dramatist; Jules Janin; M. Bertin, editor of the _Journal des  Debats_; M. Romieu, Mlle. Rachel, and Mlle. Brohan. In all some fifty  persons have a standing invitation, and come when they choose. Covers  are laid every day for twelve, and those who are there at the time,  which is six o'clock, take their places. At half-past eight the host  puts on his hat and departs, but the guests remain, and prolong the  festival at their pleasure. It is said that these dinners not only  combine every thing in the perfections of gastronomy, but that they are  equally piquant for the wit and brilliancy of the conversation that  attends them.           *       *       *       *       *    EUGENE SUE is now a member of the French Assembly; but he still finds  time to labor for democracy and socialism with his pen. He has commenced  the publication in one of the journals of a new romance, called _La  bonne Aventure_. From a few chapters, it is evident that it will possess  the enthralling interest of most of his works, and will display his  varied and vast talent in the portraiture of character and the invention  of incident. He is as intent as ever Mr. Cooper was, upon making the  novel a teacher and illustrator of opinions.           *       *       *       *       *    GEORGE SAND has completed a new drama, which, from the title, _Le  Famille du Charpentier_, we suspect to be taken out of her delightful  _Compagnon du Tour de France_. She appears to be following in the  footsteps of Dumas, in arranging her novels into plays. She has met with  a severe check in the refusal of the authorities to allow a play from  her pen to be produced at the Theatre St. Martin, entitled \"Claudia.\"  Every thing had been prepared for it, and considerable expense incurred,  when the Censor refused to grant a license.           *       *       *       *       *    ALPHONSE KARR, the French novelist, published for the late holidays a  very successful book called _Voyage autour de mon jardin_ (Journey  around my garden). It is a prose poem in honor of nature and the joys  which nature gives to the heart. Prince SOLTIKOFF has also brought out  his travels in India and Prussia in a splendid style. One of the most  elegant and universally admired works of the season at Paris, is  _Aix-les-Bains_, by Amedee Achard, illustrated by Eugene Ginain.  Aix-les-Bains is a favorite watering place in Savoy, and this book is an  account of a summer passed there.           *       *       *       *       *    In the number for the first of December, of the Paris _Revue des Deux  Mondes_, a writer introduces and dissects poems, unedited until now in  the _Romance_ tongue, of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Two new  publications from their collection of manuscripts, by the Toulouse  Academy of Floral Games, perfectly exhibit the state of the Romaunt  tongue and poetry from 1324 to 1496.           *       *       *       *       *    In the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ is an amusing paper by HENRI BLAZE, on  _Verona and Marshal Radetzky_, where, among other matters, he touches  upon _Romeo and Juliet_. The house where Juliet was born, lived, and  loved, is now turned into a vast warehouse for merchandize by the  pitiless prosaism of Time.           *       *       *       *       *    In Paris we see advertised _Lettres d'Amour_. The Author, M. Julien  Lemer, has the idea of collecting in one volume the most celebrated love  matters--the _chefs-d'oeuvre_ of tender correspondence--a style of  composition in which France has always been eminent.           *       *       *       *       *    EDMOND TEXIER has written at Paris _L'Histoire des Jeraux, ou Biographie  des Journalistes,_ described as very piquant. Such a book would do in  this country.           *       *       *       *       *    IDA VON DUERINGSFELD has published a new novel, _Antonio Foscarini_,  said to be entertaining, and to contain a good picture of Venetian life  in the fifteenth century.           *       *       *       *       *    LAMARTINE has commenced in the _Siecle_ newspaper a new novel entitled  _Le Tailleur de Saint Pierre et Saint Point_.           *       *       *       *       *    GARNIER DE CASSAGNAC has taken ground against Lamartine and his history,  in a work entitled _Histoire du Directoire_.           *       *       *       *       *    A NEW POET, John Charles Bristow, of whom no one ever heard before, has  come out in London with five thick volumes of his \"Works.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A NEW HISTORY OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS has just been issued at Paris.           *       *       *       *       *    The first volume of Sir Francis Palgrave's History of England, has just  been published in London.           *       *       *       *       *    THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND PIUS IX.--The Jesuits' printing establishment at  Naples has lately issued a quarto volume of 773 pages, consisting of the  addresses and letters sent to the Sovereign Pontiff, from Catholic  prelates and eminent laymen within the past two years. There are 297  different letters. Among the names of lay writers may be mentioned  Montalembert, Charles Dupin, D'Arlincourt, Poujoulat and De Falloux. The  country which furnishes relatively the fewest documents to this  collection, strange to say, is Italy, owing no doubt to the confused  state of the country politically. Asia, America, and even Oceanica here  give proofs that the Church has a hold among their populations, and that  they have sympathies ready in her behalf. It is well known, too, that  their sympathies do not end in words merely, but were often, as in the  case of Mexico, splendidly and solidly evinced in behalf of the fugitive  Pius. Nothing could give a more striking idea of the great extent of  Catholicism and the influence of the Church, than this book. From the  Turkish empire it gives a letter of the Archbishop Primate of  Constantinople, one from the Armenian Church in the same city, one from  the Apostolic Vicar of Bosnia, the Armenian Patriarch of Celicia,  resident in Lebanon, the Archbishop of Laodicea, at Gazir in Lebanon,  the Syrian Patriarch of Aleppo, the Patriarch of the Melchitian Greeks,  and the Patriarch of Antioch. From distant Asia the Apostolic Vicars of  Pondicherry and Bombay, the Apostolic Vicar of Japan, resident on the  island of Hong Kong, and the Superior of the Catholic community of Agra,  in the Presidency of Calcutta, all have letters. North America furnishes  a good many; in the United States, the Archbishop of Baltimore leads the  list, in which the Bishops of Oregon and Natchez are included with  others. From Canada, the Archbishop of Quebec furnishes the principal  letter. Mexico is remarkable for the number of its addresses; besides  the Metropolitan Chapter of the Capital, the Bishops of Guadalaxara,  Michoacan, Yucatan, Sonora, Oaxaca and many others, are represented in  the book. The contributions from South America are few. The Archbishops  of Lima and Santiago, in Peru and Chili, and the Monastery of Merze del  Cuzco alone furnish letters. From Brazil there is a letter of the  Archbishop of Bahia only. The addresses from Australia and Oceanica are  from the Archbishop of Sidney, and the Bishops of Melbourne and  Auckland.           *       *       *       *       *    The History, Condition and Prospects of Hayti, have been largely and  ably discussed lately in the Paris _Revue des Deux Mondes_, and in the  New York _Tribune_. Of an article in the former publication, the first  thirty-three pages form an able survey of the history of Hayti since its  independence, and of the rule of Emperor Soulouque. Nowhere is there, in  the same compass, more of authentic information and acute remark upon  the subject.           *       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26198"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 2 (of 8) (#9)"],[1,"the war terminated in a glorious victory for British arms.    [Illustration: THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR--TRANSPORT LEAVING ENGLAND FOR  THE CAPE.    Drawing by Charles J. de Lacia.]    From all accounts the two hostile columns numbered respectively 4000 and  9000 men, and against these forces Sir Penn Symons had at his command in  all about 4000. Among these were the 13th, 67th, and 69th Field  Batteries, the 18th Hussars, the Natal Mounted Volunteers, the 8th  Battalion Leicester Regiment, the 1st King's Royal Rifles, the 2nd  Dublin Fusiliers, and several companies of mounted infantry. But on the  Dublin Fusiliers, the King's Royal Rifles, and the Royal Irish Fusiliers  fell the brunt of the work, the task of capturing the Boer position, and  the magnificent dash and courage with which the almost impossible feat  was accomplished brought a thrill to the heart of all who had the good  fortune to witness it.    [Illustration]    Though the fight was a successful one, a grievous incident occurred. The  18th Hussars had received orders at 5.40 A.M. to get round the enemy's  right flank and be ready to cut off his retreat. They were accompanied  by a portion of the mounted infantry and a machine-gun. Making a wide  turning movement, they gained the eastern side of Talana Hill and there  halted, while two squadrons were sent in pursuit of the enemy. From that  time, though firing was heard at intervals throughout the day, Colonel  Moeller, with a squadron of the 18th Hussars and four sections of  mounted infantry, was lost to sight. The rain had increased and the mist  covered the hills, and it was believed that in course of time this  missing party would return. But the belief was vain. In a few days it  was discovered that they were made prisoners and had been removed to  Pretoria. The following is a list of the gallant officers who were so  unluckily captured:--         Colonel Moeller, 18th Hussars; Major Greville, 18th Hussars;       Captain Pollok, 18th Hussars; Captain Lonsdale, 2nd Battalion       Dublin Fusiliers; Lieutenant Le Mesurier, 2nd Battalion Dublin       Fusiliers; Lieutenant Garvice, 2nd Battalion Dublin Fusiliers;       Lieutenant Grimshaw, 2nd Battalion Dublin Fusiliers; Lieutenant       Majendie, 1st Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps; Lieutenant       Shore, Army Veterinary Department, attached to 18th Hussars.    An official account of the circumstances which led to the capture was  supplied by Captain Hardy, R.A.M.C., who said: \"After the battle, three  squadrons of the 18th Hussars, with one Maxim, a company of the Dublin  Fusiliers, a section of the 60th Rifles and Mounted Infantry, Colonel  Moeller commanding, kept under cover of the ridge to the north of the  camp, and at 6.30 moved down the Sand Spruit. On reaching the open the  force was shelled by the enemy, but there were no casualties.    \"Colonel Moeller took his men round Talana Hill in a south-easterly  direction, crossed the Vant's Drift road, captured several Boers, and  saw the Boer ambulances retiring. Colonel Moeller, with the B Squadron  of the Hussars, a Maxim, and mounted infantry, crossed the  Dundee-Vryheid railway, and got near a big force of the enemy, who  opened a hot fire, and Lieutenant M'Lachlan was hit.    \"The cavalry retired across Vant's Drift, 1500 Boers following. Colonel  Moeller held the ridge for some time, but the enemy enveloping his  right, he ordered the force to fall back across the Spruit. The Maxim  got fixed in a donga (water-hole). Lieutenant Cape was wounded, three of  his detachment were killed, and the horses of Major Greville and Captain  Pollok were shot.    \"The force re-formed on a ridge north of the Sand Spruit, and held it  for a short time. While Captain Hardy was attending to Lieutenant Crum,  who was wounded, Colonel Moeller retired his force into a defile,  apparently with the intention of returning to camp round the Impati  Mountain, and was not seen afterwards.\"    The following list of casualties shows how hardly the glory of victories  may be earned:--         Divisional Staff.--General Sir William Penn Symons, mortally       wounded in stomach; Colonel C. E. Beckett, A.A.G., seriously       wounded, right shoulder; Major Frederick Hammersley, D.A.A.G.,       seriously wounded, leg. Brigade Staff.--Colonel John       Sherston,[1] D.S.O., Brigade Major, killed; Captain Frederick       Lock Adam, Aide-de-Camp, seriously wounded, right shoulder. 1st       Battalion Leicestershire Regiment.--Lieutenant B. de W. Weldon,       wounded slightly, hand. 1st Battalion Royal Irish       Fusiliers.--Second Lieutenant A. H. M. Hill, killed; Major W.       P. Davison, wounded; Captain and Adjutant F. H. B. Connor,       wounded (since dead); Captain M. J. W. Pike, wounded;       Lieutenant C. C. Southey, wounded; Second Lieutenant M. B. C.       Carbery, wounded dangerously, face and shoulder; Second       Lieutenant H. C. W. Wortham, wounded severely, both thighs.       Royal Dublin Fusiliers.--Captain George Anthony Weldon, killed;       Captain Maurice Lowndes, wounded dangerously, left leg; Captain       Atherstone Dibley, wounded dangerously, head; Lieutenant       Charles Noel Perreau, wounded; Lieutenant Charles Jervis Genge,       wounded (since dead). 1st Battalion King's Royal       Rifles.--Killed: Lieutenant-Colonel R. H. Gunning,[2] Captain       M. H. K. Pechell, Lieutenant J. Taylor, Lieutenant R. C.       Barnett, Second Lieutenant N. J. Hambro.--Wounded: Major C. A.       T. Boultbee, upper thigh, dangerously; Captain O. S. W. Nugent,       Captain A. R. M. Stuart-Wortley, Lieutenant F. M. Crum,       Lieutenant R. Johnstone, both thighs, severely; Second       Lieutenant G. H. Martin, thigh and arm, severely. 18th       Hussars.--Wounded: Second Lieutenant H. A. Cape, Second       Lieutenant Albert C. M'Lachlan, Second Lieutenant E. H.       Bayford.    The Boer force engaged in this action was computed at 4000 men, of whom  about 500 were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Three of their guns  were left dismounted on Talana Hill, but there was no opportunity of  bringing them away.    Our own losses were severe, amounting to 10 officers and 31  non-commissioned officers and men killed, 20 officers and 165  non-commissioned officers and men wounded, and 9 officers and 211  non-commissioned officers and men missing.    Though General Symons was known to be at the point of death, his promotion  was speedily gazetted, and it was some consolation to feel that the  gallant and popular officer lasted long enough to read of the recognition  of his worth by an appreciative country. The following is an extract from  the _Gazette_:--    \"The Queen has been pleased to approve of the promotion of Colonel  (local Lieutenant-General) Sir W. P. Symons, K.C.B., commanding 4th  Division Natal Field Force, to be Major-General, supernumerary to the  establishment, for distinguished service in the field.\"    An officer who was taken prisoner by the enemy, writing home soon after  this engagement, made touching reference to some of the killed and  wounded: \"Poor Jack Sherston! Several of the officers here saw him lying  dead on the hill at Dundee. When he left with the message entrusted to  him he said to me, 'I shall never return.' Poor Captain Pechell! He had  a bullet through the neck. General Symons was wounded and thrown from  his horse, but he remounted and was conducted to the hospital, where he  learnt that the height had been taken by our troops. His health improved  a little, but he died on the following Tuesday. What a list of losses  already! It is terrible to think that our own cannon were fired by  mistake on our men, killing a large number. I saw M'Lachlan when he was  wounded with a bullet in his leg. He went about on horseback saying that  it did not hurt him, but at last he had to go to the hospital. My  bugler, such a pleasant fellow, was hit in the head, the body, and the  throat, and killed on the spot.... From a wounded officer, who is a  prisoner, I hear that poor Cape had a bullet in the throat and another  in the leg. He emptied his revolver twice ere falling. He is progressing  towards recovery.... He had the command of our Maxim gun which fell into  the hands of the enemy. The entire detachment which worked the gun was  killed or wounded. At that moment bullets were whistling all round us.  Cape, I think, has been exchanged for one of the enemy's wounded. I  suppose that he will be sent home invalided. I wonder what the future  has in store for us? It is really heart-breaking to think that we are  penned in here without being able to do anything but wait.\"                                    ELANDSLAAGTE    Amongst other things, it was known in Ladysmith on the 18th of October  that General Koch's commando was moving to the Biggarsberg Pass on the  way to Elandslaagte. The advanced guard of the Boers finding a train at  the Elandslaagte station, attempted to seize it, but the driver with  remarkable pluck turned on steam, and, though pelted with bullets, got  safely to Dundee. The second train was captured, however, and with it  its valuable cargo of live stock, and two newspaper correspondents, who  were made prisoners. Finding that the enemy was gathered in force round  Dundee, and that an attack there was hourly to be expected, and,  moreover, that several Free State commandoes were shifting about round  Ladysmith, the inhabitants of that town had an uneasy time.  Major-General French, who had but recently arrived from England, was  directed by Sir George White to make a reconnaissance in force in the  neighbourhood of Elandslaagte. He moved his cavalry in the pouring rain  some twelve miles along the Dundee road, but besides locating the enemy,  and beyond the capture of two of their number, who seemed not  ill-disposed to be made prisoners, little was done. On the following  day, Saturday, another reconnaissance was made. General French with  Lieutenant-Colon"]]]
