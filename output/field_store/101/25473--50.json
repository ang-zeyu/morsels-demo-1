But  remember it is the emperor who has decided upon this marriage.\"    \"My father will do me the justice to believe that I am too submissive a  daughter to be a rebellious subject.\"    \"Excellent, Vaninka, excellent,\" said the general. \"So, then, poor  Foedor has told you all?\"    \"Yes,\" said Vaninka.    \"You knew that he addressed himself to me first?\"    \"I knew it.\"    \"Then it was from him that you heard that your hand was engaged?\"    \"It was from him.\"    \"And he consented to leave you? He is a good and noble young man, who  shall always be under my protection wherever he goes. Oh, if my word had  not been given, I love him so much that, supposing you did not dislike  him, I should have given him your hand.\"    \"And you cannot recall your promise?\" asked Vaninka.    \"Impossible,\" said the general.    \"Well, then, I submit to my father's will,\" said Vaninka.    \"That is spoken like my daughter,\" said the general, embracing her.  \"Farewell, Vaninka; I do not ask if you love him. You have both done  your duty, and I have nothing more to exact.\"    With these words, he rose and left the room. Annouschka was in the  corridor; the general signed to her that she might go in again, and went  on his way. At the door of his room he found Gregory waiting for him.    \"Well, your excellency?\" he asked.    \"Well,\" said the general, \"you are both right and wrong. Foedor loves my  daughter, but my daughter does not love him. He went into my daughter's  room at eleven o'clock, but at midnight he left her for ever. No matter,  come to me tomorrow, and you shall have your thousand roubles and your  liberty.\"    Gregory went off, dumb with astonishment.    Meanwhile, Annouschka had re-entered her mistress's room, as she had  been ordered, and closed the door carefully behind her.    Vaninka immediately sprang out of bed and went to the door, listening to  the retreating footsteps of the general. When they had ceased to be  heard, she rushed into Annouschka's room, and both began to pull aside a  bundle of linen, thrown down, as if by accident, into the embrasure of a  window. Under the linen was a large chest with a spring lock. Annouschka  pressed a button, Vaninka raised the lid. The two women uttered a loud  cry: the chest was now a coffin; the young officer, stifled for want of  air, lay dead within.    For a long time the two women hoped it was only a swoon. Annouschka  sprinkled his face with water; Vaninka put salts to his nose. All was in  vain. During the long conversation which the general had had with his  daughter, and which had lasted more than half an hour, Foedor, unable to  get out of the chest, as the lid was closed by a spring, had died for  want of air. The position of the two girls shut up with a corpse was  frightful. Annouschka saw Siberia close at hand; Vaninka, to do her  justice, thought of nothing but Foedor. Both were in despair. However,  as the despair of the maid was more selfish than that of her mistress,  it was Annouschka who first thought of a plan of escaping from the  situation in which they were placed.    \"My lady,\" she cried suddenly, \"we are saved.\" Vaninka raised her head  and looked at her attendant with her eyes bathed in tears.    \"Saved?\" said she, \"saved? We are, perhaps, but Foedor!\"    \"Listen now,\" said Annouschka: \"your position is terrible, I grant that,  and your grief is great; but your grief could be greater and your  position more terrible still. If the general knew this.\"    \"What difference would it make to me?\" said Vaninka. \"I shall weep for  him before the whole world.\"    \"Yes, but you will be dishonoured before the whole world! To-morrow your  slaves, and the day after all St. Petersburg, will know that a man died  of suffocation while concealed in your chamber. Reflect, my lady: your  honour is the honour of your father, the honour of your family.\"    \"You are right,\" said Vaninka, shaking her head, as if to disperse the  gloomy thoughts that burdened her brain,--\"you are right, but what must  we do?\"    \"Does my lady know my brother Ivan?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"We must tell him all.\"    \"Of what are you thinking?\" cried Vaninka. \"To confide in a man? A man,  do I say? A serf! a slave!\"    \"The lower the position of the serf and slave, the safer will our secret  be, since he will have everything to gain by keeping faith with us.\"    \"Your brother is a drunkard,\" said Vaninka, with mingled fear and  disgust.    \"That is true,\" said Annouschka; \"but where will you find a slave who is  not? My brother gets drunk less than most, and is therefore more to be  trusted than the others. Besides, in the position in which we are we  must risk something.\"    \"You are right,\" said Vaninka, recovering her usual resolution, which  always grew in the presence of danger. \"Go and seek your brother.\"    \"We can do nothing this morning,\" said Annouschka, drawing back the  window curtains. \"Look, the dawn is breaking.\"    \"But what can we do with the body of this unhappy man?\" cried Vaninka.    \"It must remain hidden where it is all day, and this evening, while you  are at the Court entertainment, my brother shall remove it.\"    \"True,\" murmured Vaninka in a strange tone, \"I must go to Court this  evening; to stay away would arouse suspicion. Oh, my God! my God!\"    \"Help me, my lady,\" said Annouschka; \"I am not strong enough alone.\"    Vaninka turned deadly pale, but, spurred on by the danger, she went  resolutely up to the body of her lover; then, lifting it by the  shoulders, while her maid raised it by the legs, she laid it once more  in the chest. Then Annouschka shut down the lid, locked the chest, and  put the key into her breast. Then both threw back the linen which had  hidden it from the eyes of the general. Day dawned, as might be  expected, ere sleep visited the eyes of Vaninka.    She went down, however, at the breakfast hour; for she did not wish to  arouse the slightest suspicion in her father's mind. Only it might have  been thought from her pallor that she had risen from the grave, but the  general attributed this to the nocturnal disturbance of which he had  been the cause.    Luck had served Vaninka wonderfully in prompting her to say that Foedor  had already gone; for not only did the general feel no surprise when he  did not appear, but his very absence was a proof of his daughter's  innocence. The general gave a pretext for his aide-de-camp's absence by  saying that he had sent him on a mission. As for Vaninka, she remained  out of her room till it was time to dress. A week before, she had been  at the Court entertainment with Foedor.    Vaninka might have excused herself from accompanying her father by  feigning some slight indisposition, but two considerations made her fear  to act thus: the first was the fear of making the general anxious, and  perhaps of making him remain at home himself, which would make the  removal of the corpse more difficult; the second was the fear of meeting  Ivan and having to blush before a slave. She preferred, therefore, to  make a superhuman effort to control herself; and, going up again into  her room, accompanied by her faithful Annouschka, she began to dress  with as much care as if her heart were full of joy. When this cruel  business was finished, she ordered Annouschka to shut the door; for she  wished to see Foedor once more, and to bid a last farewell to him who  had been her lover. Annouschka obeyed; and Vaninka, with flowers in her  hair and her breast covered with jewels, glided like a phantom into her  servant's room.    Annouschka again opened the chest, and Vaninka, without shedding a tear,  without breathing a sigh, with the profound and death-like calm of  despair, leant down towards Foedor and took off a plain ring which the  young man had on his finger, placed it on her own, between two  magnificent rings, then kissing him on the brow, she said, \"Goodbye, my  betrothed.\"    At this moment she heard steps approaching. It was a groom of the  chambers coming from the general to ask if she were ready. Annouschka  let the lid of the chest fall, and Vaninka going herself to open the  door, followed the messenger, who walked before her, lighting the way.    Such was her trust in her foster-sister that she left her to accomplish  the dark and terrible task with which she had burdened herself.    A minute later, Annouschka saw the carriage containing the general and  his daughter leave by the main gate of the hotel.    She let half an hour go by, and then went down to look for Ivan. She  found him drinking with Gregory, with whom the general had kept his  word, and who had received the same day one thousand roubles and his  liberty. Fortunately, the revellers were only beginning their  rejoicings, and Ivan in consequence was sober enough for his sister to  entrust her secret to him without hesitation.    Ivan followed Annouschka into the chamber of her mistress. There she  reminded him of all that Vaninka, haughty but generous, had allowed his  sister to do for him. The, few glasses of brandy Ivan had already  swallowed had predisposed him to gratitude (the drunkenness of the  Russian is essentially tender). Ivan protested his devotion so warmly  that Annouschka hesitated no longer, and, raising the lid of the chest,  showed him the corpse of Foedor. At this terrible sight Ivan remained an  instant motionless, but he soon began to calculate how much money and  how many benefits the possession of such a secret would bring him. He  swore by the most solemn oaths never to betray his mistress, and  offered, as Annouschka had hoped, to dispose of the body of the  unfortunate aide-decamp.    The thing was easily done. Instead of returning to drink with Gregory  and his comrades, Ivan went to prepare a sledge, filled it with straw,  and hid at the bottom "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2758"],[0,"Marquise De Ganges (#9)"],[1,"de Ganges did very well without one.\"    It may easily be supposed that this melancholy event did not pass  without inciting the wits of the day to write a vast number of verses  and bouts-rimes about the catastrophe by which one of the most beautiful  women of the country was carried off. Readers who have a taste for that  sort of literature are referred to the journals and memoirs of the  times.    Now, as our readers, if they have taken any interest at all in the  terrible tale just narrated, will certainly ask what became of the  murderers, we will proceed to follow their course until the moment when  they disappeared, some into the night of death, some into the darkness  of oblivion.    The priest Perette was the first to pay his debt to Heaven: he died at  the oar on the way from Toulouse to Brest.    The chevalier withdrew to Venice, took service in the army of the Most  Serene Republic, then at war with Turkey, and was sent to Candia, which  the Mussulmans had been besieging for twenty years; he had scarcely  arrived there when, as he was walking on the ramparts of the town with  two other officers, a shell burst at their feet, and a fragment of it  killed the chevalier without so much as touching his companions, so that  the event was regarded as a direct act of Providence.    As for the abbe, his story is longer and stranger. He parted from the  chevalier in the neighbourhood of Genoa, and crossing the whole of  Piedmont, part of Switzerland, and a corner of Germany, entered Holland  under the name of Lamartelliere. After many hesitations as to the place  where he would settle, he finally retired to Viane, of which the Count  of Lippe was at that time sovereign; there he made the acquaintance of a  gentleman who presented him to the count as a French religious refugee.    The count, even in this first conversation, found that the foreigner who  had come to seek safety in his dominions possessed not only great  intelligence but a very solid sort of intelligence, and seeing that the  Frenchman was conversant with letters and with learning, proposed that  he should undertake the education of his son, who at that time was nine  years old. Such a proposal was a stroke of fortune for the abbe de  Ganges, and he did not dream of refusing it.    The abbe de Ganges was one of those men who have great mastery over  themselves: from the moment when he saw that his interest, nay, the very  safety of his life required it, he concealed with extreme care whatever  bad passions existed within him, and only allowed his good qualities to  appear. He was a tutor who supervised the heart as sharply as the mind,  and succeeded in making of his pupil a prince so accomplished in both  respects, that the Count of Lippe, making use of such wisdom and such  knowledge, began to consult the tutor upon all matters of State, so that  in course of time the so-called Lamartelliere, without holding any  public office, had become the soul of the little principality.    The countess had a young relation living with her, who though without  fortune was of a great family, and for whom the countess had a deep  affection; it did not escape her notice that her son's tutor had  inspired this poor young girl with warmer feelings than became her high  station, and that the false Lamartelliere, emboldened by his own growing  credit, had done all he could to arouse and keep up these feelings. The  countess sent for her cousin, and having drawn from her a confession of  her love, said that she herself had indeed a great regard for her son's  governor, whom she and her husband intended to reward with pensions and  with posts for the services he had rendered to their family and to the  State, but that it was too lofty an ambition for a man whose name was  Lamartelliere, and who had no relations nor family that could be owned,  to aspire to the hand of a girl who was related to a royal house; and  that though she did not require that the man who married her cousin  should be a Bourbon, a Montmorency, or a Rohan, she did at least desire  that he should be somebody, though it were but a gentleman of Gascony or  Poitou.    The Countess of Lippe's young kinswoman went and repeated this answer,  word for word, to her lover, expecting him to be overwhelmed by it; but,  on the contrary, he replied that if his birth was the only obstacle that  opposed their union, there might be means to remove it. In fact, the  abbe, having spent eight years at the prince's court, amid the strongest  testimonies of confidence and esteem, thought himself sure enough of the  prince's goodwill to venture upon the avowal of his real name.    He therefore asked an audience of the countess, who immediately granted  it. Bowing to her respectfully, he said, \"Madame, I had flattered myself  that your Highness honoured me with your esteem, and yet you now oppose  my happiness: your Highness's relative is willing to accept me as a  husband, and the prince your son authorises my wishes and pardons my  boldness; what have I done to you, madame, that you alone should be  against me? and with what can you reproach me during the eight years  that I have had the honour of serving your Highness?\"    \"I have nothing to reproach you with, monsieur,\" replied the countess:  \"but I do not wish to incur reproach on my own part by permitting such a  marriage: I thought you too sensible and reasonable a man to need  reminding that, while you confined yourself to suitable requests and  moderate ambitions, you had reason to be pleased with our gratitude. Do  you ask that your salary shall be doubled? The thing is easy. Do you  desire important posts? They shall be given you; but do not, sir, so far  forget yourself as to aspire to an alliance that you cannot flatter  yourself with a hope of ever attaining.\"    \"But, madame,\" returned the petitioner, \"who told you that my birth was  so obscure as to debar me from all hope of obtaining your consent?\"    \"Why, you yourself, monsieur, I think,\" answered the countess in  astonishment; \"or if you did not say so, your name said so for you.\"    \"And if that name is not mine, madame?\" said the abbe, growing bolder;  \"if unfortunate, terrible, fatal circumstances have compelled me to take  that name in order to hide another that was too unhappily famous, would  your Highness then be so unjust as not to change your mind?\"    \"Monsieur,\" replied the countess, \"you have said too much now not to go  on to the end. Who are you? Tell me. And if, as you give me to  understand, you are of good birth, I swear to you that want of fortune  shall not stand in the way.\"    \"Alas, madame,\" cried the abbe, throwing himself at her feet, \"my name,  I am sure, is but too familiar to your Highness, and I would willingly  at this moment give half my blood that you had never heard it uttered;  but you have said it, madame, have gone too far to recede. Well, then, I  am that unhappy abbe de Ganges whose crimes are known and of whom I have  more than once heard you speak.\"    \"The abbe de Ganges!\" cried the countess in horror,--\"the abbe de  Ganges! You are that execrable abbe de Ganges whose very name makes one  shudder? And to you, to a man thus infamous, we have entrusted the  education of our only son? Oh, I hope, for all our sakes, monsieur, that  you are speaking falsely; for if you were speaking the truth I think I  should have you arrested this very instant and taken back to France to  undergo your punishment. The best thing you can do, if what you have  said to me is true, is instantly to leave not only the castle, but the  town and the principality; it will be torment enough for the rest of my  life whenever I think that I have spent seven years under the same roof  with you.\"    The abbe would have replied; but the countess raised her voice so much,  that the young prince, who had been won over to his tutor's interests  and who was listening at his mother's door, judged that his protege's  business was taking an unfavourable turn; and went in to try and put  things right. He found his mother so much alarmed that she drew him to  her by an instinctive movement, as though to put herself under his  protection, and beg and pray as he might; he could only obtain  permission for his tutor to go away undisturbed to any country of the  world that he might prefer, but with an express prohibition of ever  again entering the presence of the Count or the Countess of Lippe.    The abbe de Ganges withdrew to Amsterdam, where he became a teacher of  languages, and where his lady-love soon after came to him and married  him: his pupil, whom his parents could not induce, even when they told  him the real name of the false Lamartelliere, to share their horror of  him, gave him assistance as long as he needed it; and this state of  things continued until upon his wife attaining her majority he entered  into possession of some property that belonged to her. His regular  conduct and his learning, which had been rendered more solid by long and  serious study, caused him to be admitted into the Protestant consistory;  there, after an exemplary life, he died, and none but God ever knew  whether it was one of hypocrisy or of penitence.    As for the Marquis de Ganges, who had been sentenced, as we have seen,  to banishment and the confiscation of his property, he was conducted to  the frontier of Savoy and there set at liberty. After having spent two  or three years abroad, so that the terrible catastrophe in which he had  been concerned should have time to be hushed up, he came back to France,  and as nobody--Madame de Rossan being now dead--was interested in  prosecuting him, he returned to his castle at Ganges, and remained  there, pretty well hidden. M. de Baville, indeed, the Lieutenant of  Languedoc, learned that the marquis had broken from his exile; but he  was told, at the same time, that the marquis, as a zealous Catholic, was  forcing his vassals to attend mass, whatever their "]]]
