As we see, the Convention had declared that slavery would not be  practised in the Transvaal, but though the original declaration may  have been made in all good faith, the Boer by degrees, and after the  lapse of years, found it expedient to acquire native \"apprentices,\"  who could not change master nor task without permission. They began  to fear that these natives could not be dealt with, as they were in  the habit of dealing with them, without fear of comment from such  British visitors as came across them; and they therefore attempted  to block up the path of travellers, refusing them a passage through  the Republic, and in some instances ordering the expulsion of  visitors across the Vaal. About this time one of the most gruesome  of all the many massacres in which the Boers were concerned took  place. One Potgieter (not the Potgieter who was the rival of  Pretorius), in charge of a small party of thirty men, women, and  children, went forth to barter ivory unlawfully with Makapau, a  Kaffir chief. The Kaffirs, owing the Boers a grudge for many a day,  pounced on the whole party, leaving not one behind to give an  account of the awful tragedy. The chief Potgieter was flayed alive,  and his skin made into a kaross or cloak. The Boers were swift to  revenge. President Pretorius, with an army of some four hundred, set  himself to track down the assassins. The Kaffirs fled at the  approach of the enemy, enclosing themselves in a huge cave, where  they hoped to escape detection. This cave was blockaded by the  Boers. Here the unhappy blacks went through all the horrors of  famine and thirst, and when their agony became unbearable, and they  sallied forth in desperation in search of water, they were  remorselessly shot down one by one. Nine hundred in all were killed  outside the cave. Within was more than double that number who had  perished in the frightful agonies of starvation. President Kruger  himself was a witness of the terrible scene, and took an active  share in his countrymen's revenge. And this was not the first nor  the last time in which he figured conspicuously in the bloody  records of his country's history. It was only on the occasion of the  Jameson Raid that Oom Paul awakened to sentimental qualms regarding  the spilling of blood.    [Illustration: BLOEMFONTEIN FROM THE SOUTH.    Photo by Wilson, Aberdeen.]      THE GRONDWET    To thoroughly grasp the methods of the New South African Republic,  it may be interesting to study some of \"the Articles\" of a Grondwet  or Constitution, which superseded those originally adopted by the  Potchefstroom Raad. The Grondwet was started in 1857, and was framed  entirely to suit the then condition of the Boer community. The  ordinary idea of a written constitution was at that time unknown,  and the meaning of such words as \"rigid\" or \"elastic\" was, of  course, beyond their comprehension. These only developed a  significance when the judicial crisis of 1897 put a fresh face on  Republican affairs.    _Article 4_ states that \"the people desire no extension of  territory, except only on principles of justice, whenever the  interests of the Republic render it advisable.\"    _Article 6._--\"Its territory is open to every stranger who submits  himself to the laws of the Republic; all persons who happen to be  within the territory of this Republic have equal claim to protection  of person and property.\"    _Article 8._--\"The people claim as much social freedom as possible  (_de meest mogelyke maatschappelyke vryheid_), and expect to attain  it by upholding their religion, fulfilling their obligations,  submitting to law, order, and justice, and maintaining the same. The  people permit the spread of the Gospel among the heathen, subject to  prescribed provisions against the practice of fraud and deception.\"    _Article 9._--\"The people will not allow of any equality between  coloured and white inhabitants, either in Church or in State.\"    _Article 10._--\"The people will not brook any dealing in slaves or  slavery in this Republic (_will geen slavenhandel, noch slaverny in  deze Republick dulden_).\"    Before passing on to other sections, Article 10 calls for attention.  In spite of its terms, the Boers of that period had a practice which  might be described as sailing very near the wind. The \"apprenticeship\"  of children taken prisoners in the native wars was uncommonly like  slave-owning. They were called \"orphans\"--sometimes they had been made  orphans by the conquerors--and they were then \"apprenticed\" to the  Boer farmers till grown up. Though opinions differ on this point, it  has been asserted by those who know that there was a curious system of  \"transfer\" connected with these so-called apprentices, and that even  when grown they seldom gained their liberty save by escape.    Further articles entrust legislation to a Volksraad chosen by vote  of the burghers, providing at the same time that the people shall be  allowed three months' grace for intimating to the Raad their views  on any prospective law, \"those laws, however, which admit of no  delay excepted.\" Others constitute an Executive Council, \"which  shall also recommend to the Raad all officers for the public  service\"; others refer to the liberty of the press; restrict  membership of the Volksraad to members of the Dutch Reformed  Congregations; state that \"the people do not desire to allow amongst  them any Roman Catholic Churches, nor any other Protestant Churches  except those in which such tenets of the Christian belief are taught  as are prescribed in the Heidelberg Catechism\"; and give the  Volksraad the power of making treaties, save in time of war or of  imminent danger.    The members of the Raad were to be twelve in number at least, and  were to be between the ages of thirty and sixty. They must be  burghers of the Dutch Reformed Church, residents, and owners of  landed property in the Republic; no native nor bastard was to be  admitted to the Raad. At the age of twenty-one every burgher,  provided he belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church, was entitled to  the franchise. The election of the President to a five years' term  of office was in the hands of the burghers, and in this office he  was to be supported by an Executive Council consisting of the  Commandant-General, two burghers qualified to vote, and a Secretary.  All the able-bodied men of the Republic, and if necessary natives,  were liable to military service.    No sooner was the Grondwet arranged than Marthinus Wessels  Pretorius, the son of the chief Andries Pretorius,--who died in  1853--was elected President of the South African Republic. The next  few years were spent in internal dissension, consequent on the  ambition of the President and the jealousy of his political rivals.  Finally Lydenburg, which had struggled to proclaim itself an  independent Republic, yielded, and affairs relating to the  government of the country seemed to be mending. Still there were  always Messrs. Kruger and Schoeman, two adventurous politicians, who  kept things lively in the councils of the State. On the retirement  of Pretorius from the Free State Presidency in 1864, and his  re-election to that of the South African Republic, Mr. Kruger was  appointed Commandant-General, and for the time being his ambitious  longings were appeased.    At that period the white population consisted of merely about thirty  thousand all told. The native community almost trebled the Dutch.  Mr. Bryce, in his \"Impressions on South Africa,\" describes the then  state of the affairs of the Republic as anything but satisfactory:  \"There were hundreds of thousands of natives, a few of whom were  living as servants under a system of enforced labour which was  sometimes hardly distinguishable from slavery, while the vast  majority were ruled by their own chiefs, some as tributaries of the  Republic, some practically independent of it. With the latter wars  were frequently raging--wars in which shocking cruelties were  perpetrated on both sides, the Kaffirs massacring the white families  whom they surprised, the Boer commandos taking a savage vengeance  upon the tribes when they captured a kraal or mountain stronghold.  It was the sight of these wars which drove Dr. Livingstone to begin  his famous explorations to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23748"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 3 (#9)"],[1,"of the  Democracy, though not Van Buren himself, had come to favor the  annexation of Texas. The southwestern boundary of the United States had  ever since the purchase in Florida in 1819 been recognized as the Sabine  River, west of this lying the then foreign country of Texas. France had  claimed the Rio Grande as Louisiana's western bound, but Mr. Monroe, to  placate the North in the Florida annexation, had receded from this  claim. Texas and Coahuila became a state in the new Mexican republic,  which Spain recognized in 1821; but in 1836 Texas declared itself  independent. It was ill-governed and weighed down with debt, and hence  almost immediately, in 1837, asked membership in the American Union. Its  annexation was bitterly opposed all over the North, so bitterly in fact  that the northern Democrats would not have dared, even had they wished,  to favor the scheme. Yet so strong was the southern influence in the  party by 1840 that the democratic platform that year urged the  \"re-annexation\" of Texas, the term assuming that as a part of Louisiana  it had always been ours since 1803. This was a fact, but it was now  asseverated by the Democracy for a selfish sectional purpose, and the  cry brought thousands of votes to the Whigs.    It proved good politics for the Whigs in 1840 to pass over Clay and  adopt as their candidate William Henry Harrison. He had indeed been  unsuccessful in 1836, owing to the great popularity of Jackson, all  whose influence went for Van Buren; but now that \"Little Van,\" or  \"Matty,\" as Jackson used to call him, stood alone, Harrison had a better  chance. His political record had been inconspicuous but honorable.  Nothing could be alleged against his character. He was a gentleman of  some ability, while his brilliant military record in 1812, now revived  to the minutest detail, gave him immense popularity. Every surviving  Tippecanoe or Thames veteran stumped his vicinity for the old war-horse.  Many wavering Democrats in the South, especially those of the  nullification stripe, were toled to the whig ticket by the nomination of  John Tyler for Vice-President. \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too\" rang through  the land as the whig watchword for the campaign. During the  electioneering every hamlet was regaled with portrayals of Harrison's  simple farm life at North Bend, where, a log cabin his dwelling, and  hard cider--so one would have supposed--his sole beverage, he had been a  genuine Cincinnatus. \"Tippecanoe and Tyler\" were therefore elected;  their popular vote numbering 1,275,017, against 1,128,702 polled for Van  Buren.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  William Henry Harrison  From a Copy at the Corcoran Art Gallery of a painting by Beard in 1840.      However, this whig success, for a moment so imposing, proved superficial  and brief. Harrison died at the end of his first month in office, and  Tyler, coming in, showed that though training under the whig banner, he  had not renounced a single one of his democratic principles. The Whigs  scorned and soon officially repudiated him During the entire four years  that he held office there was constant deadlock between him and the  slight whig majority in Congress, which gave the Democrats main control  in legislation. The panic of 1837 was forgotten, while the hold of the  Democracy upon the country was so firm that its gains in Congress and  its triumphs in the States once more went steadily on.        CHAPTER VII.    LIFE AND MANNERS IN THE FOURTH DECADE    [1835]    By the census of 1830 the United States had a population of 12,866,020,  the increase having been for the preceding ten years about sufficient to  double the inhabitants in thirty years. There were twenty-four States,  Indiana having been taken into the Union in 1816, Mississippi in 1817,  Illinois in 1818, Alabama in 1819, Maine in 1820, and Missouri, the  last, in 1821. Florida, Michigan, and Arkansas were the Territories. The  area, now that Florida had been annexed, was 725,406 square miles.    Comparatively little of the soil of Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, and  Wisconsin had as yet been occupied, though settlements were making on  most of the larger streams. The southwest had at this time filled up  more rapidly than the northwest. In 1830 the centre of population for  the Union was farther south than it has ever been at any other time.  Except in Louisiana and Missouri, not over thirty thousand inhabitants  were to be found west of the Mississippi. The vast outer ranges of the  Louisiana purchase remained a mysterious wilderness. Indianapolis in  1827 contained twenty-five brick houses, sixty frame, and about eighty  log houses; also a court-house, a jail, and three churches. Chicago was  laid out in 1830. Thither in, 1834 went one mail per week, from Niles,  Mich., on horseback. In 1833 it was incorporated as a town, having 175  houses and 550 inhabitants. That year it began publishing a newspaper  and organized two churches. In 1837 it was a city, with 4,170  inhabitants. The Territory of Iowa had in 1836, 10,500 inhabitants; in  1840, 43,000. At this time Wisconsin had 31,000. So early as 1835 Ohio  had nearly or quite 1,000,000 inhabitants. Sixty-five of its towns had  together 125 newspapers. Between 1830 and 1840 Ohio's population rose  from 900,000 to 1,500,000; Michigan's, from 30,000 to 212,000; and the  whole country's, from 13,000,000 to 17,000,000. Before 1840, eight  steamers connected Chicago with Buffalo.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John Tyler  From a photograph by Brady.      By 1840 nearly all the land of the United States this side the  Mississippi had been taken up by settlers. The last districts to be  occupied were Northern Maine, the Adirondack region of New York, a strip  in Western Virginia from the Potomac southward through Kentucky nearly  to the Tennessee line, the Pine Barrens of Georgia, and the extremities  of Michigan and Wisconsin. Beyond the Father of Waters his shores were  mostly occupied, as well as those of his main tributaries, a good way  from their mouths. The Missouri Valley had population as far as Kansas  City. Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa Territory had many settlements at  some distance from the streams. The aggregate population of the country  was 17,069,453, the average density twenty-one and a tenth to the square  mile. The mass of westward immigration was as yet native, since the  great rush from Europe only began about 1847. This was fortunate, as  fixing forever the American stamp upon the institutions of western  States. To compensate each new commonwealth for the non-taxation of the  United States land it contained, it received one township in each  thirty-six as its own for educational purposes, a provision to which is  due the magnificent school system of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa,  Minnesota, and their younger sisters.    Farther east, too, there had, of course, been growth, but it was slower.  In 1827 Hartford had but 6,900 inhabitants; New Haven, 7,100; Newark, N.  J., 6,500, and New Brunswick about the same. The State of New York paid  out, between 1815 and 1825, nearly $90,000 for the destruction of  wolves, showing that its rural population had attained little density.  The entire country had vastly improved in all the elements of  civilization. A national literature had sprung up, crowding out the  reprints of foreign works which had previously ruled the market. Bryant,  Cooper, Dana, Drake, Halleck, and Irving were now re-enforced by writers  like Bancroft, Emerson, Hawthorne, Holmes, Longfellow, Poe, Prescott,  and Whittier. Educational institutions were multiplied and their methods  bettered, The number of newspapers had become enormous. Several  religious journals were established previous to 1830, among them the New  York Observer, which dates from 1820, and the Christian Register, from  1821. Steam printing had been introduced in 1823. The year 1825 saw the  first Sunday paper; it was the New York Sunday Courier. Greeley began  his New York Tribune only in 1841.    Fresh news had begun to be prized, as shown by the competition between  the two great New York sheets, the Journal of Commerce and the Morning  Enquirer, each of which, in 1827, established for this purpose swift  schooner lines and pony expresses. The Journal of Commerce in 1833 put  on a horse express between Philadelphia and New York, with relays of  horses, enabling it to publish congressional news a day earlier than any  of its New York contemporaries. Other papers soon imitated this example,  whereupon the Journal extended its relays to Washington. Mails came to  be more numerous and prompt. More letters were written, and, from 1839,  letters were sent in envelopes. Postage-stamps were not used till 1847.  Most of the principal cities in the country, including Rochester and  Cincinnati, published dailies before 1830. Baltimore and Louisville had  each a public school in 1829. This year witnessed in Boston the  beginning work of the first blind asylum in the country. In Hartford  instruction had already been given to the deaf and dumb since 1817.      [Illustration: Express rider changing horses.]  A Pony Express.      By the fourth decade of the century the American character had assumed a  good deal of definiteness and greatly interested foreign travellers.  There was, by those who knew what foreign manners were, much foolish  aping of the same. English visitors noted Brother Jonathan's drawl in  talking, his phlegmatic temperament, keen eye, and blistering  inquisitiveness. Jonathan was a rover and a trader, everywhere at home,  everywhere bent upon the main chance. He ate too rapidly, chewed and  smoked tobacco, and spat indecently. He drank too much. During the first  quarter of the century nearly everyone used liquor, and drunkenness was  shamefully common. Every public entertainment, even if religious, set  out provision of free punch. At hotels, brandy was placed upon the  table, free as water to all. The smaller"]]]
