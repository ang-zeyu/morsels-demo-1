He  rises boldly to his feet, and, wrapping his blanket or buffalo robe  round him, he walks up and down as if he were a member of the tribe.  At  the same time he dexterously cuts the laryats of such horses as he  observes are not hobbled.  He dare not stoop to cut the hobbles, as the  action would be observed, and suspicion would be instantly aroused.  He  then leaps on the best horse he can find, and uttering a terrific  war-whoop darts away into the plains, driving the loosened horses before  him.    No such dark thieves were supposed to be near the camp under the  birch-tree, however, so Joe, and Dick, and Henri ate their supper in  comfort, and let their horses browse at will on the rich pasturage.    A bright ruddy fire was soon kindled, which created, as it were, a  little ball of light in the midst of surrounding darkness for the  special use of our hardy hunters.  Within this magic circle all was  warm, comfortable, and cheery.  Outside all was dark, and cold, and  dreary by contrast.    When the substantial part of supper was disposed of, tea and pipes were  introduced, and conversation began to flow.  Then the three saddles were  placed in a row; each hunter wrapped himself in his blanket, and,  pillowing his head on his saddle, stretched his feet towards the fire  and went to sleep, with his loaded rifle by his side and his  hunting-knife handy in his belt.  Crusoe mounted guard by stretching  himself out _couchant_ at Dick Varley's side.  The faithful dog slept  lightly and never moved all night, but had any one observed him closely  he would have seen that every fitful flame that burst from the sinking  fire, every unusual puff of wind, and every motion of the horses that  fed or rested hard by, had the effect of revealing a speck of glittering  white in Crusoe's watchful eye.        CHAPTER SIX.    THE GREAT PRAIRIES OF THE \"FAR WEST\"--A REMARKABLE COLONY DISCOVERED,  AND A MISERABLE NIGHT ENDURED.    Of all the hours of the night or day the hour that succeeds the dawn is  the purest, the most joyous and the best.  At least so think we; and so  think hundreds and thousands of the human family; and so thought Dick  Varley, as he sprung suddenly into a sitting posture next morning, and  threw his arms with an exulting feeling of delight round the neck of  Crusoe, who instantly sat up to greet him.    This was an unusual piece of enthusiasm on the part of Dick, but the dog  received it with marked satisfaction, rubbed his big hairy cheek against  that of his young master, and arose from his sedentary position in order  to afford free scope for the use of his tail.    \"Ho!  Joe Blunt!  Henri!  Up, boys, up!  The sun will have the start o'  us.  I'll catch the nags.\"    So saying Dick bounded away into the woods with Crusoe gambolling  joyously at his heels.  Dick soon caught his own horse and Crusoe caught  Joe's.  Then the former mounted and quickly brought in the other two.    Returning to the camp he found everything packed and ready to strap on  the back of the pack-horse.    \"That's the way to do it, lad,\" cried Joe.  \"Here Henri, look alive and  git yer beast ready.  I do believe yer goin' to take another snooze!\"    Henri was indeed, at that moment, indulging in a gigantic stretch and a  cavernous yawn, but he finished both hastily, and rushed at his poor  horse as if he intended to slay it on the spot.  He only threw the  saddle on its back, however, and then threw himself on the saddle.    \"Now then, all ready?\"    \"Ay,--oui, yis!\"    And away they went at full stretch again on their journey.    Thus day after day they travelled, and night after night they laid them  down to sleep under the trees of the forest, until at length they  reached the edge of the Great Prairie.    It was a great, a memorable day in the life of Dick Varley, that on  which he first beheld the prairie,--the vast boundless prairie.  He had  heard of it, talked of it, dreamed about it, but he had never,--no, he  had never realised it.  'Tis always thus.  Our conceptions of things  that we have not seen are almost invariably wrong.  Dick's eyes  glittered, and his heart swelled, and his cheeks flushed, and his breath  came thick and quick.    \"There it is,\" he gasped, as the great rolling plain broke suddenly on  his enraptured gaze; \"that's it--oh!--\"    Dick uttered a yell that would have done credit to the fiercest chief of  the Pawnees, and, being unable to utter another word, he swung his cap  in the air and sprang like an arrow from a bow over the mighty ocean of  grass.  The sun had just risen to send a flood of golden glory over the  scene; the horses were fresh, so the elder hunters, gladdened by the  beauty of all around them, and inspired by the irresistible enthusiasm  of their young companion, gave the reins to the horses and flew after  him.  It was a glorious gallop, that first headlong dash over the  boundless prairie of the \"far west!\"    The prairies have often been compared, most justly, to the ocean.  There  is the same wide circle of space bounded on all sides by the horizon;  there is the same swell, or undulation, or succession of long low  unbroken waves that marks the ocean when it is calm; they are canopied  by the same pure sky, and swept by the same untrammelled breezes.  There  are islands, too--clumps of trees and willow-bushes,--which rise out of  this grassy ocean to break and relieve its uniformity; and these vary in  size and numbers as do the isles of ocean--being numerous in some  places, while in others they are so scarce that the traveller does not  meet one in a long day's journey.  Thousands of beautiful flowers decked  the green sward, and numbers of little birds hopped about among them.    \"Now, lads,\" said Joe Blunt, reining up, \"our troubles begin to-day.\"    \"Our troubles! our joys, you mean!\" exclaimed Dick Varley.    \"P'raps I don't mean nothin' o' the sort,\" retorted Joe.  \"Man wos never  intended to swaller his joys without a strong mixtur' o' troubles.  I  s'pose he couldn't stand 'em pure.  Ye see we've got to the prairie  now--\"    \"One blind hoss might see dat!\" interrupted Henri.    \"An' we may or may not diskiver buffalo.  An' water's scarce, too, so  we'll need to look out for it pretty sharp, I guess, else we'll lose our  horses, in which case we may as well give out at once.  Besides, there's  rattlesnakes about in sandy places--we'll ha' to look out for them; an'  there's badger holes--we'll need to look sharp for them lest the horses  put their feet in 'em; an' there's Injuns, who'll look out pretty sharp  for _us_ if they once get wind that we're in them parts.\"    \"Oui, yis, mes boys, and there's rain, and tunder, and lightin',\" added  Henri, pointing to a dark cloud which was seen rising on the horizon  ahead of them.    \"It'll be rain,\" remarked Joe, \"but there's no thunder in the air jist  now; we'll make for yonder clump o' bushes and lay by till it's past.\"    Turning a little to the right of the course they had been following, the  hunters galloped along one of the hollows between the prairie waves  before mentioned, in the direction of a clump of willows.  Before  reaching it however, they passed over a bleak and barren plain where  there was neither flower nor bird.  Here they were suddenly arrested by  a most extraordinary sight--at least it was so to Dick Varley, who had  never seen the like before.  This was a colony of what Joe called  \"prairie-dogs.\"  On first beholding them Crusoe uttered a sort of half  growl, half bark of surprise, cocked his tail and ears, and instantly  prepared to charge, but he glanced up at his master first for  permission.  Observing that his finger and his look commanded \"silence\"  he dropped his tail at once and stepped to the rear.  He did not,  however, cease to regard the prairie-dogs with intense curiosity.    These remarkable little creatures have been egregiously misnamed by the  hunters of the west, for they bear not the slightest resemblance to  dogs, either in formation or habits.  They are, in fact, the marmot, and  in size are little larger than squirrels, which animals they resemble in  some degree.  They burrow under the light soil and throw it up in mounds  like moles.    Thousands of them were running about among their dwellings when Dick  first beheld them, but the moment they caught sight of the horsemen  rising over the ridge, they set up a tremendous hubbub of consternation;  each little beast instantly mounted guard on the top of his house and  prepared, as it were, to \"receive cavalry.\"    The most ludicrous thing about them was, that although the most timid  and cowardly creatures in the world, they seemed the most impertinent  things that ever lived!  Knowing that their holes afforded them a  perfectly safe retreat they sat close beside them, and as the hunters  slowly approached, they elevated their heads, wagged their little tails,  showed their teeth, and chattered at them like monkeys.  The nearer they  came the more angry and furious did the prairie-dogs become, until Dick  Varley almost fell off his horse with suppressed laughter.  They let the  hunters come close up, waxing louder and louder in their wrath; but the  instant a hand was raised to throw a stone or point a gun, a thousand  little heads dived into a thousand holes, and a thousand little tails  wriggled for an instant in the air--then, a dead silence reigned over  the deserted scene.    \"Bien, them's have dive into de bo'-els of de eart',\" said Henri with a  broad grin.    Presently a thousand noses appeared, and nervously disappeared like the  wink of an eye.  Then they appeared again, and a thousand pairs of eyes  followed.  Instantly, like Jack in the box, they were all on the top of  their hillocks again, chattering and wagging their little tails as  vigorously as ever.  You could not say that you _saw_ them jump out of  their holes.  Suddenly, as if by magic, they _were_ out; then Dick  tossed up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#9)"],[1," certain of killing the bull.  He knows what he has done  before, he feels that he can do it again, therefore he stands like a  hero.  Were a doubt of his capacity to cross his mind for an instant,  his cheek would blanch, his hand would tremble, and, ten to one, he  would turn and flee like the rest.    Let muffs, therefore, learn to swim, to leap, and to run.  Let them  wrestle with boys bigger than themselves, regardless of being thrown.  Let them practise \"jinking\" with their companions, so that if even they  be chased by a mad bull, they will, if unable to get out of his way by  running, escape perhaps by jinking.  Let them learn to leap off  considerable heights into deep water, so that, if ever called on to leap  off the end of a pier or the side of a ship to save a fellow-creature,  they may do so with confidence and promptitude.  Let them even put on  \"the gloves,\" and become regardless of a swelled nose, in order that  they may be able to defend themselves or others from sudden assault.  So  doing they will become sensible fellows, whose character I have thus to  some extent described.  Of course, I speak of sensible fellows only with  reference to this one subject of training the nerves and muscles.  Let  it never be forgotten that there are men who, although sensible in this  respect, are uncommonly senseless in regard to other things of far  higher moment.    As to boasters, I will dismiss them with a few words.  They are too  easily known to merit particular description.  They are usually loud and  bold in the drawing-room, but rather mild in the field.  They are  desperately egotistical, fond of exaggeration, and prone to depreciate  the deeds of their comrades.  They make bad soldiers and sailors, and  are usually held in contempt by others, whatever they may think of  themselves.  I may wind up this digression--into which I have been  tempted by an earnest desire to warn my fellow-men against the errors of  nervous and muscular education, which, in my case, led to the weak  conduct of which I had been guilty that day--I may wind up this  digression, I say, by remarking that the boys who are most loved in this  world are those who are lambs, _almost_ muffs, in the drawing-room, but  lions in the field.    How long I should have gone on pondering this subject I know not, but  Peterkin somewhat rudely interrupted me by uttering a wild scream, and  beginning to caper as if he were a madman.  I was much alarmed as well  as surprised at this course of conduct; for although my friend was an  inveterate joker, he was the very reverse of what is termed a buffoon,  and never indulged in personally grotesque actions with a view to make  people laugh--such as making faces, a practice which, in ninety-nine  cases out of a hundred, causes the face-makers to look idiotical rather  than funny, and induces beholders to pity them, and to feel very  uncomfortable sensations.    Peterkin's yells, instead of ceasing, continued and increased.    \"Why, what's wrong?\"  I cried, in much alarm.    Instead of answering, Peterkin darted away through the wood like a  maniac, tearing off his clothes as he went.  At the same moment Jack  began to roar like a bull, and became similarly distracted.  It now  flashed across me that they must have been attacked by an army of the  Bashikouay ant, a species of ant which is so ferocious as to prove a  perfect scourge to the parts of the country over which it travels.  The  thought had scarcely occurred to me when I was painfully convinced of  its accuracy.  The ants suddenly came to me, and in an instant I was  covered from head to foot by the passionate creatures, which hit me so  severely that I also began to scream and to tear off my garments; for I  had been told by the trader who accompanied us to this part of the  country that this was the quickest method of getting rid of them.    We all three fled, and soon left the army of Bashikouay ants behind us,  undressing, as we ran, in the best way we could; and when we at length  came to a halt we found ourselves almost in a state of nudity.  Hastily  divesting ourselves of the remainder of our apparel, we assisted each  other to clear away the ants, though we could not rid ourselves of the  painful effects of the bites with which we were covered.    \"What dreadful villains!\" gasped Peterkin, as he busied himself in  hastily picking off the furious creatures from his person.    \"It would be curious to observe the effect of an army of soldiers  stepping into an army of Bashikouays,\" said Jack.  \"They would be routed  instantly.  No discipline or courage could hold them together for two  minutes after they were attacked.\"    I was about to make some reply, when our attention was attracted by a  shout at no great distance, and in a few seconds we observed, to our  confusion, the trader and a band of negroes approaching us.  We hurried  on our clothes as rapidly as possible, and were a little more  presentable when they arrived.  They had a good laugh at us, of course,  and the naked blacks seemed to be much tickled with the idea that we had  been compelled to divest ourselves, even for a short time, of what they  considered our unnecessary covering.    \"We thought you were lost,\" said the trader, \"and I began to blame  myself for letting you away into the woods, where so many dangers may be  encountered, without a guide.  But what have you got there? meat of some  kind?  Your guns seem to have done service on this your first  expedition.\"    \"Ay, that they have,\" answered Jack.  \"We've killed a buffalo bull, and  if you send your black fellows back on our track for some hours they'll  come to the carcass, of which we could not, of course, bring very much  away on our shoulders, which are not accustomed yet to heavy loads.\"    \"Besides,\" added Peterkin, \"we were anxious to get back in time for your  elephant-hunt, else we should have brought more meat with us.  But Jack  has not mentioned what I consider our chief prize, the honour of  shooting which belongs to my friend Ralph Rover.--Come, Ralph, unfasten  your pack and let them see it.\"    Although unwilling to put off more time, I threw down my pack, and  untying it, displayed my leopard skin.  The shout of delight and  surprise which the sight of it drew from the negroes was so enthusiastic  that I at once perceived I was considered to have secured a great prize.    \"Why, Mr Rover, you're in luck,\" said the trader, examining the skin;  \"it's not every day that one falls in with such a fine leopard as that.  And you have already made a reputation as a daring hunter, for the  niggers consider it a bold and dangerous thing to attack these critters;  they're so uncommon fierce.\"    \"Indeed I do not by any means deserve such a reputation,\" said I,  refastening my pack, \"for the shot was entirely accidental; so I pray  you, good sir, to let the negroes know that, as I have no desire to go  under a false flag, as my friend Peterkin would say--\"    \"Go under a false flag!\" exclaimed Peterkin, in contempt.  \"Sail under  false colours, man!  That's what you should have said.  Whatever you do,  Ralph, never misquote a man.  Go under a false flag! ha, ha!  Why, you  might just as well have said, `progress beneath assumed bunting.'\"    \"Well, accidental or otherwise,\" said the trader, \"you've got credit for  the deed, and your fame will be spread among the tribe whether you will  or not; for these fellows are such incorrigible liars themselves that  they will never believe you if you tell them the shot was accidental.  They will only give you credit for some strange though unknown motive in  telling such a falsehood.\"    While the trader was speaking I observed that the negroes were talking  with the eager looks and gesticulations that are peculiar to the  Africans when excited, and presently two or three of them came forward  and asked several questions, while their eyes sparkled eagerly and their  black faces shone with animation as they pointed into the woods in the  direction whence we had come.    \"They want to know where you have left the carcass of the leopard, and  if you have taken away the brains,\" said the trader, turning to me.  \"I  daresay you know--if not you'll soon come to find out--that all the  nigger tribes in Africa are sunk in gross and cruel superstitions.  They  have more fetishes, and greegrees, and amulets, and wooden gods, and  charms, than they know what to do with, and have surrounded themselves  with spiritual mysteries that neither themselves nor anybody else can  understand.  Among other things, they attach a very high value to the  brains of the leopard, because they imagine that he who possesses them  will be rendered extraordinarily bold and successful in hunting.  These  fellows are in hopes that, being ignorant of the value of leopard  brains, you have left them in the carcass, and are burning with anxiety  to be off after them.\"    \"Poor creatures!\" said I, \"they are heartily welcome to the brains; and  the carcass lies not more than four hours' march from this spot, I  should think,--Is it not so, Jack?\"    My friend nodded assent, and the trader, turning to the expectant crowd  of natives, gave them the information they desired.  No sooner had he  finished than with loud cries they turned and darted away, tossing their  arms wildly in the air, and looking more like to a band of scared  monkeys than to human beings.    \"They're queer fellows,\" remarked Peterkin.    \"So they are,\" replied the trader, \"and they're kindly fellows too--  jovial and good-humoured, except when under the influence of their  abominable superstitions.  Then they become incarnate fiends, and commit  deeds of cruelty that make one's blood run cold to think of.\"    I felt much saddened by these remarks, and asked the trader if the  missionaries accomplished any good among them.    \"Oh yes,\" he replied, \"they do much good, such of them at least as  really are missionaries; for it does "]]]
