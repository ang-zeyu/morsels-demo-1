Standing with his hands behind him, he waited for the  moment when he would be ordered to his work.    John Lexman--A. O. 43--looked up at the blue sky as he had looked so  many times from the exercise yard, and wondered what the day would bring  forth. A day to him was the beginning and the end of an eternity. He  dare not let his mind dwell upon the long aching years ahead. He dare  not think of the woman he left, or let his mind dwell upon the agony  which she was enduring. He had disappeared from the world, the world he  loved, and the world that knew him, and all that there was in life; all  that was worth while had been crushed and obliterated into the granite  of the Princetown quarries, and its wide horizon shrunken by the gaunt  moorland with its menacing tors.    New interests made up his existence. The quality of the food was one.  The character of the book he would receive from the prison library  another. The future meant Sunday chapel; the present whatever task they  found him. For the day he was to paint some doors and windows of an  outlying cottage. A cottage occupied by a warder who, for some reason,  on the day previous, had spoken to him with a certain kindness and a  certain respect which was unusual.    \"Face the wall,\" growled a voice, and mechanically he turned, his hands  still behind him, and stood staring at the grey wall of the prison  storehouse.    He heard the shuffling feet of the quarry gang, his ears caught the  clink of the chains which bound them together. They were desperate men,  peculiarly interesting to him, and he had watched their faces furtively  in the early period of his imprisonment.    He had been sent to Dartmoor after spending three months in Wormwood  Scrubbs. Old hands had told him variously that he was fortunate or  unlucky. It was usual to have twelve months at the Scrubbs before  testing the life of a convict establishment. He believed there was some  talk of sending him to Parkhurst, and here he traced the influence which  T. X. would exercise, for Parkhurst was a prisoner's paradise.    He heard his warder's voice behind him.    \"Right turn, 43, quick march.\"    He walked ahead of the armed guard, through the great and gloomy gates  of the prison, turned sharply to the right, and walked up the village  street toward the moors, beyond the village of Princetown, and on the  Tavistock Road where were two or three cottages which had been lately  taken by the prison staff; and it was to the decoration of one of these  that A. O. 43 had been sent.    The house was as yet without a tenant.    A paper-hanger under the charge of another warder was waiting for the  arrival of the painter. The two warders exchanged greetings, and the  first went off leaving the other in charge of both men.    For an hour they worked in silence under the eyes of the guard.  Presently the warder went outside, and John Lexman had an opportunity of  examining his fellow sufferer.    He was a man of twenty-four or twenty-five, lithe and alert. By no means  bad looking, he lacked that indefinable suggestion of animalism which  distinguished the majority of the inhabitants at Dartmoor.    They waited until they heard the warder's step clear the passage, and  until his iron-shod boots were tramping over the cobbled path which led  from the door, through the tiny garden to the road, before the second  man spoke.    \"What are you in for?\" he asked, in a low voice.    \"Murder,\" said John Lexman, laconically.    He had answered the question before, and had noticed with a little  amusement the look of respect which came into the eyes of the  questioner.    \"What have you got!\"    \"Fifteen years,\" said the other.    \"That means 11 years and 9 months,\" said the first man. \"You've never  been here before, I suppose?\"    \"Hardly,\" said Lexman, drily.    \"I was here when I was a kid,\" confessed the paper-hanger. \"I am going  out next week.\"    John Lexman looked at him enviously. Had the man told him that he had  inherited a great fortune and a greater title his envy would not have  been so genuine.    Going out!    The drive in the brake to the station, the ride to London in creased,  but comfortable clothing, free as the air, at liberty to go to bed and  rise when he liked, to choose his own dinner, to answer no call save the  call of his conscience, to see--he checked himself.    \"What are you in for?\" he asked in self-defence.    \"Conspiracy and fraud,\" said the other cheerfully. \"I was put away by  a woman after three of us had got clear with 12,000 pounds. Damn rough  luck, wasn't it?\"    John nodded.    It was curious, he thought, how sympathetic one grows with these  exponents of crimes. One naturally adopts their point of view and sees  life through their distorted vision.    \"I bet I'm not given away with the next lot,\" the prisoner went on.  \"I've got one of the biggest ideas I've ever had, and I've got a real  good man to help me.\"    \"How?\" asked John, in surprise.    The man jerked his head in the direction of the prison.    \"Larry Green,\" he said briefly. \"He's coming out next month, too, and we  are all fixed up proper. We are going to get the pile and then we're off  to South America, and you won't see us for dust.\"    Though he employed all the colloquialisms which were common, his tone  was that of a man of education, and yet there was something in his  address which told John as clearly as though the man had confessed as  much, that he had never occupied any social position in life.    The warder's step on the stones outside reduced them to silence.  Suddenly his voice came up the stairs.    \"Forty-three,\" he called sharply, \"I want you down here.\"    John took his paint pot and brush and went clattering down the  uncarpeted stairs.    \"Where's the other man?\" asked the warder, in a low voice.    \"He's upstairs in the back room.\"    The warder stepped out of the door and looked left and right. Coming up  from Princetown was a big, grey car.    \"Put down your paint pot,\" he said.    His voice was shaking with excitement.    \"I am going upstairs. When that car comes abreast of the gate, ask no  questions and jump into it. Get down into the bottom and pull a sack  over you, and do not get up until the car stops.\"    The blood rushed to John Lexman's head, and he staggered.    \"My God!\" he whispered.    \"Do as I tell you,\" hissed the warder.    Like an automaton John put down his brushes, and walked slowly to the  gate. The grey car was crawling up the hill, and the face of the driver  was half enveloped in a big rubber mask. Through the two great goggles  John could see little to help him identify the man. As the machine came  up to the gate, he leapt into the tonneau and sank instantly to the  bottom. As he did so he felt the car leap forward underneath him. Now  it was going fast, now faster, now it rocked and swayed as it gathered  speed. He felt it sweeping down hill and up hill, and once he heard a  hollow rumble as it crossed a wooden bridge.    He could not detect from his hiding place in what direction they were  going, but he gathered they had switched off to the left and were making  for one of the wildest parts of the moor. Never once did he feel the car  slacken its pace, until, with a grind of brakes, it stopped suddenly.    \"Get out,\" said a voice.    John Lexman threw off the cover and leapt out and as he did so the car  turned and sped back the way it had come.    For a moment he thought he was alone, and looked around. Far away in  the distance he saw the grey bulk of Princetown Gaol. It was an accident  that he should see it, but it so happened that a ray of the sun fell  athwart it and threw it into relief.    He was alone on the moors! Where could he go?    He turned at the sound of a voice.    He was standing on the slope of a small tor. At the foot there was a  smooth stretch of green sward. It was on this stretch that the people of  Dartmoor held their pony races in the summer months. There was no sign  of horses; but only a great bat-like machine with out-stretched pinions  of taut white canvas, and by that machine a man clad from head to foot  in brown overalls.    John stumbled down the slope. As he neared the machine he stopped and  gasped.    \"Kara,\" he said, and the brown man smiled.    \"But, I do not understand. What are you going to do!\" asked Lexman, when  he had recovered from his surprise.    \"I am going to take you to a place of safety,\" said the other.    \"I have no reason to be grateful to you, as yet, Kara,\" breathed Lexman.  \"A word from you could have saved me.\"    \"I could not lie, my dear Lexman. And honestly, I had forgotten the  existence of the letter; if that is what you are referring to, but I am  trying to do what I can for you and for your wife.\"    \"My wife!\"    \"She is waiting for you,\" said the other.    He turned his head, listening.    Across the moor came the dull sullen boom of a gun.    \"You haven't time for argument. They discovered your escape,\" he said.  \"Get in.\"    John clambered up into the frail body of the machine and Kara followed.    \"This is a self-starter,\" he said, \"one of the newest models of  monoplanes.\"    He clicked over a lever and with a roar the big three-bladed tractor  screw spun.    The aeroplane moved forward with a jerk, ran with increasing gait for a  hundred yards, and then suddenly the jerky progress ceased. The machine  swayed gently from side to side, and looking over, the passenger saw the  ground recede beneath him.    Up, up, they climbed in one long sweeping ascent, passing through  drifting clouds till the machine soared like a bird above the blue sea.    John Lexman looked down. He saw the indentations of the coast and  recognized the fringe of white houses that stood for Torquay, but in an  incredibly short space of time all signs of the land were blotted out.    Talking was impossible. The roar of the engines defied penetration.    Kara was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26908"],[0,"Conversations on Chemistry, V. 1-2 (#9)"],[1,"of temperature.    EMILY.    I suppose, then, that all elastic fluids are of the same density?    MRS. B.    Very far from it; they vary in density, more than either liquids or  solids. The uniformity of their expansibility, which at first may appear  singular, is, however, readily accounted for. For if the different  susceptibilities of expansion of bodies arise from their various degrees  of attraction of cohesion, no such difference can be expected in elastic  fluids, since in these the attraction of cohesion does not exist, their  particles being on the contrary possessed of an elastic or repulsive  power; they will therefore all be equally expanded by equal degrees of  caloric.    EMILY.    True; as there is no power opposed to the expansive force of caloric in  elastic bodies, its effect must be the same in all of them.    MRS. B.    Let us now proceed to examine the other properties of free caloric.    Free caloric always tends to diffuse itself equally, that is to say,  when two bodies are of different temperatures, the warmer gradually  parts with its heat to the colder, till they are both brought to the  same temperature. Thus, when a thermometer is applied to a hot body, it  receives caloric; when to a cold one, it communicates part of its own  caloric, and this communication continues until the thermometer and the  body arrive at the same temperature.    EMILY.    Cold, then, is nothing but a negative quality, simply implying the  absence of heat.    MRS. B.    Not the total absence, but a diminution of heat; for we know of no body  in which some caloric may not be discovered.    CAROLINE.    But when I lay my hand on this marble table I feel it _positively_ cold,  and cannot conceive that there is any caloric in it.    MRS. B.    The cold you experience consists in the loss of caloric that your hand  sustains in an attempt to bring its temperature to an equilibrium with  the marble. If you lay a piece of ice upon it, you will find that the  contrary effect will take place; the ice will be melted by the heat  which it abstracts from the marble.    CAROLINE.    Is it not in this case the air of the room, which being warmer than the  marble, melts the ice?    MRS. B.    The air certainly acts on the surface which is exposed to it, but the  table melts that part with which it is in contact.    CAROLINE.    But why does caloric tend to an equilibrium? It cannot be on the same  principle as other fluids, since it has no weight?    MRS. B.    Very true, Caroline, that is an excellent objection. You might also,  with some propriety, object to the term _equilibrium_ being applied to a  body that is without weight; but I know of no expression that would  explain my meaning so well. You must consider it, however, in a  figurative rather than a literal sense; its strict meaning is an _equal  diffusion_. We cannot, indeed, well say by what power it diffuses itself  equally, though it is not surprising that it should go from the parts  which have the most to those which have the least. This subject is best  explained by a theory suggested by Professor Prevost of Geneva, which is  now, I believe, generally adopted.    According to this theory, caloric is composed of particles perfectly  separate from each other, every one of which moves with a rapid velocity  in a certain direction. These directions vary as much as imagination can  conceive, the result of which is, that there are rays or lines of these  particles moving with immense velocity in every possible direction.  Caloric is thus universally diffused, so that when any portion of space  happens to be in the neighbourhood of another, which contains more  caloric, the colder portion receives a quantity of calorific rays from  the latter, sufficient to restore an equilibrium of temperature. This  radiation does not only take place in free space, but extends also to  bodies of every kind. Thus you may suppose all bodies whatever  constantly radiating caloric: those that are of the same temperature  give out and absorb equal quantities, so that no variation of  temperature is produced in them; but when one body contains more free  caloric than another, the exchange is always in favour of the colder  body, until an equilibrium is effected; this you found to be the case  when the marble table cooled your hand, and again when it melted the  ice.    CAROLINE.    This reciprocal radiation surprises me extremely; I thought, from what  you first said, that the hotter bodies alone emitted rays of caloric  which were absorbed by the colder; for it seems unnatural that a hot  body should receive any caloric from a cold one, even though it should  return a greater quantity.    MRS. B.    It may at first appear so, but it is no more extraordinary than that a  candle should send forth rays of light to the sun, which, you know, must  necessarily happen.    CAROLINE.    Well, Mrs. B--, I believe that I must give up the point. But I wish I  could _see_ these rays of caloric; I should then have greater faith in  them.    MRS. B.    Will you give no credit to any sense but that of sight? You may feel the  rays of caloric which you receive from any body of a temperature higher  than your own; the loss of the caloric you part with in return, it is  true, is not perceptible; for as you gain more than you lose, instead of  suffering a diminution, you are really making an acquisition of caloric.  It is, therefore, only when you are parting with it to a body of a lower  temperature, that you are sensible of the sensation of cold, because you  then sustain an absolute loss of caloric.    EMILY.    And in this case we cannot be sensible of the small quantity of heat we  receive in exchange from the colder body, because it serves only to  diminish the loss.    MRS. B.    Very well, indeed, Emily. Professor Pictet, of Geneva, has made some  very interesting experiments, which prove not only that caloric radiates  from all bodies whatever, but that these rays may be reflected,  according to the laws of optics, in the same manner as light. I shall  repeat these experiments before you, having procured mirrors fit for the  purpose; and it will afford us an opportunity of using the differential  thermometer, which is particularly well adapted for these experiments.  --I place an iron bullet, (PLATE III. Fig. 1.) about two inches in  diameter, and heated to a degree not sufficient to render it luminous,  in the focus of this large metallic concave mirror. The rays of heat  which fall on this mirror are reflected, agreeably to the property of  concave mirrors, in a parallel direction, so as to fall on a similar  mirror, which, you see, is placed opposite to the first, at the distance  of about ten feet; thence the rays converge to the focus of the second  mirror, in which I place one of the bulbs of this thermometer. Now,  observe in what manner it is affected by the caloric which is reflected  on it from the heated bullet. --The air is dilated in the bulb which we  placed in the focus of the mirror, and the liquor rises considerably in  the opposite leg.      [Illustration: Plate III. Vol. I. p. 54    Mr. Pictet's Apparatus for the Reflection of Heat.      Fig. 1.    A.A. & B.B Concave mirrors fixed on stands.    C Heated Bullet placed in the focus of the mirror A.    D Thermometer, with its bulb placed in the focus of the mirror B.    1.2.3.4 Rays of Caloric radiating from the bullet & falling on the      mirror A.    5.6.7.8 The same rays reflected from the mirror A to the mirror B.    9.10.11.12 The same rays reflected by the mirror B to the      Thermometer.]    EMILY.    But would not the same effect take place, if the rays of caloric from  the heated bullet fell directly on the thermometer, without the  assistance of the mirrors?    MRS. B.    The effect would in that case be so trifling, at the distance at which  the bullet and the thermometer are from each other, that it would be  almost imperceptible. The mirrors, you know, greatly increase the  effect, by collecting a large quantity of rays into a focus; place your  hand in the focus of the mirror, and you will find it much hotter there  than when you remove it nearer to the bullet.    EMILY.    That is very true; it appears extremely singular to feel the heat  diminish in approaching the body from which it proceeds.    CAROLINE.    And the mirror which produces so much heat, by converging the rays, is  itself quite cold.    MRS. B.    The same number of rays that are dispersed over the surface of the  mirror are collected by it into the focus; but, if you consider how  large a surface the mirror presents to the rays, and, consequently, how  much they are diffused in comparison to what they are at the focus,  which is little more than a point, I think you can no longer wonder that  the focus should be so much hotter than the mirror.    The principal use of the mirrors in this experiment is, to prove that  the calorific emanation is reflected in the same manner as light.    CAROLINE.    And the result, I think, is very conclusive.    MRS. B.    The experiment may be repeated with a wax taper instead of the bullet,  with a view of separating the light from the caloric. For this purpose a  transparent plate of glass must be interposed between the mirrors; for  light, you know, passes with great facility through glass, whilst the  transmission of caloric is almost wholly impeded by it. We shall find,  however, in this experiment, that some few of the calorific rays pass  through the glass together with the light, as the thermometer rises a  little; but, as soon as the glass is removed, and a free passage left to  the caloric, it will rise considerably higher.    EMILY.    This experiment, as well as that of Dr. Herschell's, proves that light  and heat may be separated; for in the latter experiment the separation  was not perfect, any more than in that of Mr. Pictet.    CAROLINE.    I should like to repeat this experiment,"]]]
