Don't you see I must love you, because I  have never asked you for money?'    \"When she said that sort to thing I could have strangled her.    \"To shorten the story, sir, Carmen procured me civilian clothes,  disguised in which I got out of Seville without being recognised. I went  to Jerez, with a letter from Pastia to a dealer in anisette whose house  was the smugglers' meeting-place. I was introduced to them, and their  leader, surnamed _El Dancaire_, enrolled me in his gang. We started for  Gaucin, where I found Carmen, who had told me she would meet me there.  In all these expeditions she acted as spy for our gang, and she was the  best that ever was seen. She had now just returned from Gibraltar, and  had already arranged with the captain of a ship for a cargo of English  goods which we were to receive on the coast. We went to meet it near  Estepona. We hid part in the mountains, and laden with the rest, we  proceeded to Ronda. Carmen had gone there before us. It was she again  who warned us when we had better enter the town. This first journey, and  several subsequent ones, turned out well. I found the smuggler's life  pleasanter than a soldier's: I could give presents to Carmen, I had  money, and I had a mistress. I felt little or no remorse, for, as the  gipsies say, 'The happy man never longs to scratch his itch.' We were  made welcome everywhere, my comrades treated me well, and even showed me  a certain respect. The reason of this was that I had killed my man,  and that some of them had no exploit of that description on their  conscience. But what I valued most in my new life was that I often saw  Carmen. She showed me more affection than ever; nevertheless, she would  never admit, before my comrades, that she was my mistress, and she had  even made me swear all sorts of oaths that I would not say anything  about her to them. I was so weak in that creature's hands, that I obeyed  all her whims. And besides, this was the first time she had revealed  herself as possessing any of the reserve of a well-conducted woman,  and I was simple enough to believe she had really cast off her former  habits.    \"Our gang, which consisted of eight or ten men, was hardly ever together  except at decisive moments, and we were usually scattered by twos and  threes about the towns and villages. Each one of us pretended to have  some trade. One was a tinker, another was a groom; I was supposed to  peddle haberdashery, but I hardly ever showed myself in large places, on  account of my unlucky business at Seville. One day, or rather one night,  we were to meet below Veger. _El Dancaire_ and I got there before the  others.    \"'We shall soon have a new comrade,' said he. 'Carmen has just managed  one of her best tricks. She has contrived the escape of her _rom_, who  was in the _presidio_ at Tarifa.'    \"I was already beginning to understand the gipsy language, which nearly  all my comrades spoke, and this word _rom_ startled me.    \"What! her husband? Is she married, then?' said I to the captain.    \"'Yes!' he replied, 'married to Garcia _el Tuerto_*--as cunning a gipsy  as she is herself. The poor fellow has been at the galleys. Carmen has  wheedled the surgeon of the _presidio_ to such good purpose that she  has managed to get her _rom_ out of prison. Faith! that girl's worth  her weight in gold. For two years she has been trying to contrive his  escape, but she could do nothing until the authorities took it into  their heads to change the surgeon. She soon managed to come to an  understanding with this new one.'         * One-eyed man.    \"You may imagine how pleasant this news was for me. I soon saw Garcia  _el Tuerto_. He was the very ugliest brute that was ever nursed  in gipsydom. His skin was black, his soul was blacker, and he was  altogether the most thorough-paced ruffian I ever came across in my  life. Carmen arrived with him, and when she called him her _rom_ in my  presence, you should have seen the eyes she made at me, and the faces  she pulled whenever Garcia turned his head away.    \"I was disgusted, and never spoke a word to her all night. The next  morning we had made up our packs, and had already started, when we  became aware that we had a dozen horsemen on our heels. The braggart  Andalusians, who had been boasting they would murder every one who came  near them, cut a pitiful figure at once. There was a general rout. _El  Dancaire_, Garcia, a good-looking fellow from Ecija, who was called _El  Remendado_, and Carmen herself, kept their wits about them. The rest  forsook the mules and took to the gorges, where the horses could not  follow them. There was no hope of saving the mules, so we hastily  unstrapped the best part of our booty, and taking it on our shoulders,  we tried to escape through the rocks down the steepest of the slopes. We  threw our packs down in front of us and followed them as best we could,  slipping along on our heels. Meanwhile the enemy fired at us. It was  the first time I had ever heard bullets whistling around me and I  didn't mind it very much. When there's a woman looking on, there's no  particular merit in snapping one's fingers at death. We all escaped  except the poor _Remendado_, who received a bullet wound in the loins. I  threw away my pack and tried to lift him up.    \"'Idiot!' shouted Garcia, 'what do we want with offal! Finish him off,  and don't lose the cotton stockings!'    \"'Drop him!' cried Carmen.    \"I was so exhausted that I was obliged to lay him down for a moment  under a rock. Garcia came up, and fired his blunderbuss full into his  face. 'He'd be a clever fellow who recognised him now!' said he, as he  looked at the face, cut to pieces by a dozen slugs.    \"There, sir; that's the delightful sort of life I've led! That night  we found ourselves in a thicket, worn out with fatigue, with nothing to  eat, and ruined by the loss of our mules. What do you think that devil  Garcia did? He pulled a pack of cards out of his pocket and began  playing games with _El Dancaire_ by the light of a fire they kindled.  Meanwhile I was lying down, staring at the stars, thinking of _El  Remendado_, and telling myself I would just as lief be in his place.  Carmen was squatting down near me, and every now and then she would  rattle her castanets and hum a tune. Then, drawing close to me, as if  she would have whispered in my ear, she kissed me two or three times  over almost against my will.    \"'You are a devil,' said I to her.    \"'Yes,' she replied.    \"After a few hours' rest, she departed to Gaucin, and the next morning a  little goatherd brought us some food. We stayed there all that day, and  in the evening we moved close to Gaucin. We were expecting news from  Carmen, but none came. After daylight broke we saw a muleteer attending  a well-dressed woman with a parasol, and a little girl who seemed to  be her servant. Said Garcia, 'There go two mules and two women whom St.  Nicholas has sent us. I would rather have had four mules, but no matter.  I'll do the best I can with these.'    \"He took his blunderbuss, and went down the pathway, hiding himself  among the brushwood.    \"We followed him, _El Dancaire_ and I keeping a little way behind. As  soon as the woman saw us, instead of being frightened--and our dress  would have been enough to frighten any one--she burst into a fit of loud  laughter. 'Ah! the _lillipendi_! They take me for an _erani_!'*         * \"The idiots, they take me for a smart lady!\"    \"It was Carmen, but so well disguised that if she had spoken any other  language I should never have recognised her. She sprang off her mule,  and talked some time in an undertone with _El Dancaire_ and Garcia. Then  she said to me:    \"'Canary-bird, we shall meet again before you're hanged. I'm off to  Gibraltar on gipsy business--you'll soon have news of me.'    \"We parted, after she had told us of a place where we should find  shelter for some days. That girl was the providence of our gang. We soon  received some money sent by her, and a piece of news which was still  more useful to us--to the effect that on a certain day two English lords  would travel from Gibraltar to Granada by a road she mentioned. This was  a word to the wise. They had plenty of good guineas. Garcia would have  killed them, but _El Dancaire_ and I objected. All we took from them,  besides their shirts, which we greatly needed, was their money and their  watches.    \"Sir, a man may turn rogue in sheer thoughtlessness. You lose your  head over a pretty girl, you fight another man about her, there is a  catastrophe, you have to take to the mountains, and you turn from a  smuggler into a robber before you have time to think about it. After  this matter of the English lords, we concluded that the neighbourhood of  Gibraltar would not be healthy for us, and we plunged into the _Sierra  de Ronda_. You once mentioned Jose-Maria to me. Well, it was there I  made acquaintance with him. He always took his mistress with him on his  expeditions. She was a pretty girl, quiet, modest, well-mannered, you  never heard a vulgar word from her, and she was quite devoted to him.  He, on his side, led her a very unhappy life. He was always running  after other women, he ill-treated her, and then sometimes he would take  it into his head to be jealous. One day he slashed her with a knife.  Well, she only doted on him the more! That's the way with women, and  especially with Andalusians. This girl was proud of the scar on her arm,  and would display it as though it were the most beautiful thing in the  world. And then Jose-Maria was the worst of comrades in the bargain.  In one expedition we made with him, he managed so that he kept all the  profits, and we had all the trouble and the blows. But I must go back to  my story. We had no sign at all from Carmen. _El Dancaire_ said: 'One  of us will have to go to Gibraltar to get news of her. She must have  planned some business.

He had also written a poem entitled _Completo_, of which he gave me a  copy.  It was, he said, \"un grido dell' anima.\"  He had not found a  publisher for it yet, but if I would translate it into English and get it  published in London, I could send him any profits that might accrue.  I  showed it to Peppino who swore he remembered something very like it in an  Italian magazine and that the professor had had nothing to do with it  beyond copying it.  I translated it without rhymes, the professor not  having gone to that expense.  I have not offered the result to any  English publisher, none of them would receive it as Peppino did when I  showed it to him.  He said I had performed a miracle, that I had  converted a few lines of drivelling nonsense--just the sort of stuff that  would attract the professor--into a masterpiece.  But I am afraid the  prestige of the English language may have blinded Peppino to any little  defects, as it made him see more romance than I could find in the names  of the English boats.  This was my \"masterpiece\":                                     FULL INSIDE.        The train is full; Ah me! the load of travellers!      The engine whistles; Ah me! the piercing shriek!      My heart is burdened; Ah me! the weight of sorrows!      My soul exclaims; Ah me! the despairing cry!        O Train! have pity upon me      For you are strong and I am weak,      Transfer to my heart the load of your passengers      And take in exchange the weight of my sorrows.    Next time I saw the professor he was in charge of a newspaper kiosk in  Palermo, looking older and more dilapidated and still waiting for the  manna to fall from heaven.  He complained of the slackness of trade.  He  also complained that the work was too hard and was killing him; so that,  one way or the other, he intended to shut up the kiosk and look out for  something else.          CATANIA      CHAPTER V--MICHELE AND THE PRINCESS OF BIZERTA      Educated Sicilians have not a high opinion of the marionettes; it is  sometimes difficult to induce them to talk on the subject.  They say the  marionettes are for the lower orders and accuse them of being responsible  for many of the quarrels we read about in the newspapers.  The people  become so fascinated by the glamour of the romance in which they live  night after night that they imitate in private life the chivalrous  behaviour of the warriors they see fighting in the little theatres, and  thus what may begin as a playful reminiscence of something in last  night's performance occasionally leads to a too accurate imitation of one  of last night's combats and perhaps ends in a fatal wound.  This being  like the accounts in English papers about boys becoming hooligans or  running off to sea as stowaways in consequence of reading trashy  literature, my desire to attend a performance of marionettes was  increased, but I did not want to go alone for, in the event of a row,  with knives, among the audience it would be better to be accompanied by a  native.    I was in Palermo where I knew a few students, whose education was of  course still incomplete, but they were cold on the subject and said that  if they came with me we should probably be turned out for laughing.  That  was not what I wanted.  It ought to have been possible to do something  with the waiter or the porter, or even with the barber whom I met on the  stairs and in the passages of the hotel when he came in the morning to  shave the commercial travellers; but they all made difficulties--either  they did not get away from their work till too late, or it was not a  place for an Englishman or it was not safe.  At home, of course, one does  not go to the theatre with the waiter, but when in Sicily, though one  does not perhaps do altogether as the Sicilians, one does not do as one  does in England.  I know a Palermitan barber with whom I should be proud  to be seen walking in the Via Macqueda any day--that is, any day when his  Sunday clothes were not in pawn--and there used to be a conduttore at my  hotel who took me round to many of the sights in the town and who was a  person of such distinguished manners that when with him I felt as though  walking with a Knight-Templar in disguise--a disguise that had to be  completed by my buying him a straw hat, otherwise he would have given us  away by wearing his cap with \"Albergo So-and-so\" written all round it.  These are the people who really know about the marionettes, for whenever  they get an evening off they go.  It seemed, however, that I had met with  a conspiracy of obstruction.  Palermo was treating me as a good woman  treats her husband when he wants to do something of which she  disapproves--there was no explanation or arguing; what I wanted was  quietly made impossible.  So I replied by treating Palermo as a good man  treats his wife under such circumstances--I pretended to like it and  waited till I could woo some less difficult city.    Catania provided what I wanted.  There I knew a professor interested in  folk-lore and kindred subjects to whom I confided my troubles.  He  laughed at me for my failures, assured me there was no danger and offered  to take me.  It was a Sunday evening.  On arriving at the teatrino, he  spoke to an attendant who showed us in by a side entrance and gave us the  best places in the house, that is, we were near the only open window.  The seating arrangements would have been condemned by the County Council;  there were rows of benches across the floor and no passages, so that the  people had to walk on the seats to get to their places; two galleries ran  round the house very close together, an ordinary man could not have stood  upright in the lower one, and it was difficult to move in the upper one  in which we were, because the arches supporting the roof nearly blocked  it in three places on each side.  Presently a man came round and  collected our money, twenty centimes each, the seats on the ground being  fifteen.    There were four boys sitting on the stage, two at each side of the  curtain, as they used to sit in Shakespeare's theatre.  Like the rest of  the audience, these boys were of the class they call Facchini, that is,  porters, coachmen, shop assistants, shoeblacks, water-sellers, and so on.  It sometimes happens when travelling in Sicily that one has to spend half  an hour, half a day, or it may be more, in company with one of these men.  He is usually a delightful person, dignified, kind, courteous, full of  fun and extremely friendly without being obtrusive.  During conversation  one may perhaps ask him whether he can read and write; he will probably  reply that at school he was taught both.  Presently one may ask him to  read an advertisement, or to write down an address; he will probably  reply that the light is bad, or that he is occupied with the luggage or  the horses.  The fact is that reading and writing are to him very much  what the classics and the higher mathematics are to many an English  gentleman--the subjects were included in his youthful studies, but as  they have never been of the slightest use to him in earning his bread, he  has forgotten all he ever learnt of them, and does not care to say so.  The Sicilian, however, no matter how uneducated he may be, has an  appetite for romance which must be gratified and, as it would give him  some trouble to brush up his early accomplishments and stay at home  reading Pulci and Boiardo, Tasso and Ariosto, he prefers to follow the  story of Carlo Magno and his paladins and the wars against the Saracens  in the teatrino.  Besides, no Sicilian man ever stays at home to do  anything except to eat and sleep, and those are things he does out of  doors as often as not; the houses are for the women, the men live in the  street.  It is as though in England the cab-drivers, railway porters and  shop-boys were to spend evening after evening, month after month, looking  on at a dramatized version of the _Arcadia_ or _The Faerie Queene_.    Presently the curtain went up and disclosed two flaring gas-jets, each  with a small screen in front of it about halfway down the stage; these  were the footlights, and behind them was a back cloth representing a hall  with a vista of columns.  In the rather confined space between the  footlights and the back cloth there came on a knight in armour.  He stood  motionless, supporting his forehead with his right fist, the back of his  hand being outward.    \"Is he crying?\" I inquired.    \"No,\" replied the professor, \"he is meditating; if he were crying the  back of his hand would be against his face.\"    He then dropped his fist and delivered a soliloquy, no doubt embodying  the result of his meditation, after which he was joined by his twin  brother.  They conversed at length of battles and the King of Athens, of  Adrianopoli and the Grand Turk, of princesses and of journeys by sea and  land.  The act of speaking induced a curious nervous complaint, useful  because it showed which was the speaker; not only did he move his head  and his right arm in a very natural and Sicilian manner, but he was  constantly on the point of losing his balance, and only saved himself  from falling by swinging one leg from the hip forwards or backwards as  the case required.  The listening knight stood firm till he had to speak,  and then he was attacked by the complaint and the other became still.    At first I was puzzled as to the actual size of"]]]
