No matter.  It has distributed as much hospitality in its time as  many a marble palace; that was one of its backwoods' characteristics.  It stood, and I hope still stands, upon the north bank of the Ohio--that  beautiful stream--`_La belle riviere_,' as the French colonists, and  before their time the Indians, used to call it.  It was in the midst of  the woods, though around it were a thousand acres of `clearing,' where  you might distinguish fields of golden wheat, and groves of shining  maize plants waving aloft their yellow-flower tassels.  You might note,  too, the broad green leaf of the Nicotian `weed,' or the bursting pod of  the snow-white cotton.  In the garden you might observe the sweet  potato, the common one, the refreshing tomato, the huge water-melon,  cantelopes, and musk melons, with many other delicious vegetables.  You  could see pods of red and green pepper growing upon trailing plants; and  beside them several species of peas and beans--all valuable for the  colonel's _cuisine_.  There was an orchard, too, of several acres in  extent.  It was filled with fruit-trees, the finest peaches in the  world, and the finest apples--the Newton pippins.  Besides, there were  luscious pears and plums, and upon the espaliers, vines bearing bushels  of sweet grapes.  If Colonel P-- lived in the woods, it cannot be said  that he was surrounded by a desert.    \"There were several substantial log-houses near the main building or  mansion.  They were the stable--and good horses there were in that  stable; the cow-house, for milk cattle; the barn, to hold the wheat and  maize-corn; the smoke-house, for curing bacon; a large building for the  dry tobacco; a cotton-gin, with its shed of clap-boards; bins for the  husk fodder, and several smaller structures.  In one corner you saw a  low-walled erection that reminded you of a kennel, and the rich music  that from time to time issued from its apertures would convince you that  it _was_ a kennel.  If you had peeped into it, you would have seen a  dozen of as fine stag-hounds as ever lifted a trail.  The colonel was  somewhat partial to these pets, for he was a `mighty hunter.'  You might  see a number of young colts in an adjoining lot; a pet deer, a  buffalo-calf, that had been brought from the far prairies, pea-fowl,  guinea-hens, turkeys, geese, ducks, and the usual proportion of common  fowls.  Rail-fences zigzagged off in all directions towards the edge of  the woods.  Huge trees, dead and divested of their leaves, stood up in  the cleared fields.  Turkey buzzards and carrion, crows might be seen  perched upon their grey naked limbs; upon their summit you might observe  the great rough-legged falcon; and above all, cutting sharply against  the blue sky, the fork-tailed kite sailing gently about.\"    Here the doctor's auditory interrupted him with a murmur of applause.  The doctor was in fine spirits, and in a poetical mood.  He continued.    \"Such, gentlemen, was the sort of place I had come to visit; and I saw  at a glance that I could spend a few days there pleasantly enough--even  without the additional attractions of a pigeon-hunt.    \"On my arrival I found the party assembled.  It consisted of a score and  a half of ladies and gentlemen, nearly all young people.  The pigeons  had not yet made their appearance, but were looked for every hour.  The  woods had assumed the gorgeous tints of autumn, that loveliest of  seasons in the `far west.'  Already the ripe nuts and berries were  scattered profusely over the earth offering their annual banquet to  God's wild creatures.  The `mast' of the beech-tree, of which the wild  pigeon is so fond, was showering down among the dead leaves.  It was the  very season at which the birds were accustomed to visit the beechen  woods that girdled the colonel's plantation.  They would no doubt soon  appear.  With this expectation everything was made ready; each of the  gentlemen was provided with a fowling-piece, or rifle if he preferred  it; and even some of the ladies insisted upon being armed.    \"To render the sport more exciting, our host had established certain  regulations.  They were as follows:--The gentlemen were divided into two  parties, of equal numbers.  These were to go in opposite directions, the  ladies upon the first day of the hunt accompanying whichever they chose.  Upon all succeeding days, however, the case would be different.  The  ladies were to accompany that party which upon the day previous had  bagged the greatest number of birds.  The victorious gentlemen,  moreover, were endowed with other privileges, which lasted throughout  the evening; such as the choice of partners for the dinner-table and the  dance.    \"I need not tell you, gentlemen, that in these conditions existed  powerful motives for exertion.  The colonel's guests were the _elite_ of  western society.  Most of the gentlemen were young men or bachelors; and  among the ladies there were _belles_; three or four of them rich and  beautiful.  On my arrival I could perceive signs of incipient  flirtations.  Attachments had already arisen; and by many it would have  been esteemed anything but pleasant to be separated in the manner  prescribed.  A strong _esprit du corps_ was thus established; and, by  the time the pigeons arrived, both parties had determined to do their  utmost.  In fact, I have never known so strong a feeling of rivalry to  exist between two parties of amateur sportsmen.    \"The pigeons at length arrived.  It was a bright sunny morning, and yet  the atmosphere was darkened, as the vast flock, a mile in breadth by  several in length, passed across the canopy.  The sound of their wings  resembled a strong wind whistling among tree-tops, or through the  rigging of a ship.  We saw that they hovered over the woods, and settled  among the tall beeches.    \"The beginning of the hunt was announced, and we set forth, each party  taking the direction allotted to it.  With each went a number of ladies,  and even some of these were armed with light fowling-pieces, determined  that the party of their choice should be the victorious one.  After a  short ride, we found ourselves fairly `in the woods,' and in the  presence of the birds, and then the cracking commenced.    \"In our party we had eight guns, exclusive of the small fowling-pieces  (two of those), with which a brace of our heroines were armed, and  which, truth compels me to confess, were less dangerous to the pigeons  than to ourselves.  Some of our guns were double-barrelled shot-guns,  others were rifles.  You will wonder at rifles being used in such a  sport, and yet it is a fact that the gentlemen who carried rifles  managed to do more execution than those who were armed with the other  species.  This arose from the circumstance that they were contented to  aim at single birds, and, being good shots, they were almost sure to  bring these down.  The woods were filled with straggling pigeons.  Odd  birds were always within rifle range; and thus, instead of wasting their  time in endeavouring to approach the great flocks, our riflemen did  nothing but load and fire.  In this way they soon counted their game by  dozens.    \"Early in the evening, the pigeons, having filled their crops with the  mast, disappeared.  They flew off to some distant `roost.'  This of  course concluded our sport for the day.  We got together and counted our  numbers.  We had 640 birds.  We returned home full of hope; we felt  certain that we had won for that day.  Our antagonists had arrived  before us.  They showed us 736 dead pigeons.  We were beaten.    \"I really cannot explain the chagrin which this defeat occasioned to  most of our party.  They felt humiliated in the eyes of the ladies,  whose company they were to lose on the morrow.  To some there was  extreme bitterness in the idea; for, as I have already stated,  attachments had sprung up, and jealous thoughts were naturally their  concomitants.  It was quite tantalising, as we parted next morning, to  see the galaxy of lovely women ride off with our antagonists, while we  sought the woods in the opposite direction, dispirited and in silence.    \"We went, however, determined to do our best, and win the ladies for the  morrow.  A council was held, and each imparted his advice and  encouragement; and then we all set to work with shot-gun and rifle.    \"On this day an incident occurred that aided our `count' materially.  As  you know, gentlemen, the wild pigeons, while feeding, sometimes cover  the ground so thickly that they crowd upon each other.  They all advance  in the same direction, those behind continually rising up and fluttering  to the front, so that the surface presents a series of undulations like  sea-waves.  Frequently the birds alight upon each other's backs, for  want of room upon the ground, and a confused mass of winged creatures is  seen rolling through the woods.  At such times, if the sportsman can  only `head' the flock, he is sure of a good shot.  Almost every pellet  tells, and dozens may be brought down at a single discharge.    \"In my progress through the woods, I had got separated from my  companions, when I observed an immense flock approaching me after the  manner described.  I saw from their plumage that they were young birds,  and therefore not likely to be easily alarmed.  I drew my horse (I was  mounted) behind a tree, and awaited their approach.  This I did more  from curiosity than any other motive, as, unfortunately I carried a  rifle, and could only have killed one or two at the best.  The crowd  came `swirling' forward, and when they were within some ten or fifteen  paces"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#9)"],[1,"to do all He had promised, but I feared that the  people still loved worldly pleasures so well that God's mercy  would be rejected by them, and all would be lost.    About three days after the proclamation of Rigdon had been made  there was a storm of rain, during which the thunder and  lightnings were constant and terrible. The liberty pole in the  town was struck by lightning and shivered to atoms. This evidence  from the God of nature also convinced me that the Mormon people's  liberties, in that section of the country, were not to be of long  duration.        CHAPTER IV - THE SAINTS BESET WITH TROUBLES          The Saints did not consecrate their possessions as they had  so recently voted they would do; they began to reflect, and the  final determination was that they could manage their worldly  effects better than any one of the apostles; in fact, better than  the Prophet and the Priesthood combined. Individual Saints  entered large tracts of land in their own names, and thereby  secured all of the most desirable land round about Far West.  These landed proprietors became the worst kind of extortionists,  and forced the poor Saints to pay them large advances for every  acre of land that was settled, and nothing could be called free  from the control of the money power of the rich and headstrong  Mormons who had defied the revelations and wishes of God.    So things went from bad to worse, until the August election at  Gallatin referred to. The troubles of that day brought the Church  and Saints to a standstill; business was paralyzed; alarm seized  the stoutest hearts, and dismay was visible in every countenance.  The Prophet issued an order to gather all the people at Far West  and Adam-on-Diamond, under the leadership of Col. Lyman White,  for the purpose of protecting the people from mob violence, and  to save their property from lawless thieves who were roaming the  country in armed bands.    The Gentiles and Mormons hastened to the executive of the State.  The Gentiles asked for a military force to protect the settlers  from Mormon violence. The Mormons requested, an investigating  committee to inquire into the whole subject and suggest means  necessary for future safety to each party. Also they demanded  military protection from the mobs and outlaws that infested the  country.    The Governor sent troops to keep order. They were stationed about  midway between Far West and Adam-on-Diamond. A committee was also  appointed and sent to Gallatin to inquire into the recent  disturbances. This committee had full power to send for  witnesses, make arrests of persons accused of crime, and  generally to do all things necessary for a full and complete  investigation of the entire affair.    Many arrests were made at the request of the committee. The  persons so arrested were taken before Justice Black, of Daviess  County, and examined; witnesses were examined for both parties,  and much hard and false swearing was done on both sides. After a  long and fruitless examination the committee adjourned, leaving  the military to look after matters until something would turn up  to change the feeling of danger then existing. It was thought by  the committee that all would soon become quiet and peace would be  restored.    The Gentiles of the country were dissatisfied with the action of  the committee and in no way disposed to accept peace on any  terms; they determined that, come what would, the Mormons should  be driven from the State of Missouri. Letters were written by the  Gentiles around Far West to all parts of the State, and  elsewhere, giving the most fearful accounts of Mormon atrocities.  Some of the writers said it was useless to send less than three  or four men for each Mormon, because the Mormons felt sure of  heaven if they fell fighting, hence they did not fear death; that  they fought with the desperation of devils.    Such reports spread like wildfire throughout northern Missouri,  and thence all over the States of the Mississippi Valley, and  resulted in creating a feeling of the most intense hatred in the  breasts of all the Gentiles against the Mormons. Companies of  volunteers were raised and armed in every town throughout  northern Missouri, and commenced concentrating in the vicinity of  the Mormon settlements. The troops sent by the Governor to guard  the settlers and preserve order soon took part with the mob, and  all show for legal protection was gone, so far as Mormons were  concerned. I had built a cabin in the valley of Adam-on-Diamond,  at the point where the Prophet said Adam blessed his posterity  after being driven from the Garden of Eden.    The condition of the country being such that we could not labor  on our farms, I concluded to go and hunt for wild honey. Several  of my neighbors were to join me in my bee hunt, and we started  with our teams, and traveled northeasterly until we reached the  heavy timber at the three forks of Grand River. We camped on the  middle fork of Grand River, and had fine success in securing  honey.    We had been out at camp only two or three days when we discovered  signs of armed men rushing through the country. On the 3d of  October, 1838, we saw a large number of men that we knew were  enemies to the Mormons on their way, as we supposed, to attack  our people at the settlements. I concluded to go and meet them,  and find out for certain what they were really intending to do. I  was forced to act with caution, for, if they discovered that we  were Mormons, our lives would be taken by the desperate men  composing the mob who called themselves State volunteers. I took  my gun and carrying a bucket on my arm started out to meet the  people and learn their intentions. I met them just after they had  broken camp on Sunday morning.    As soon as I saw them I was certain they were out hunting for  Mormons. I concluded to pass myself off as an outsider, the  better to learn their history. My plan worked admirably. I stood  my ground until a company of eighteen men rode up to me, and  said:    \"You move early.\"    \"Not so early, gentlemen; I am not moving any sooner than you  are. What are you all doing in this part of the country, armed to  the teeth as you are? Are you hunting for Indians?\"    \"No,\" said they, \"but we wish to know where you are from, and  what you are doing.\"    \"I am from Illinois; there are four of us who have come out here  to look up a good location to settle. We stopped on Marrowbone,  and did think of staying there, until the settlers and Mormons  got into a row at Gallatin, on election day. After that we  concluded to strike out and see what this country looked like. I  am now going to cut a bee tree that I found yesterday evening,  and I brought my gun along so that if I met an old buck I could  secure some venison to eat with my honeycomb.\"    As I got through they all huddled around me and commenced to  relate the horrors of Mormonism. They advised me to have nothing  to do with the Mormons, for said they:    \"As old Joe Smith votes, so will every Mormon in the country  vote, and when they get into a fight they are just the same way;  they stick together. When you attack one of the crew you bring  every one of them after you like a nest of hornets.\"    To this I replied that I had heard a little of the fuss at  Gallatin, but did not suppose I had got the right of the story,  and would be glad if they would tell me just how it was. I should  like to learn the facts from an eyewitness. Several of the men  spoke up and said they were there and saw it all. They then told  the story, and did the Mormons more justice than I expected from  them.    They said, among other things, that there was a large rawboned  man there who spoke in tongues, and that when the fight commenced  he cried:    \"Charge, Danites!\"    They then said the Mormons must leave the country.    \"If we do not make them do so now, they will be so strong in a  few years they will rule the country as they please. Another band  of men will come along soon; and they will then go through the  Mormon settlements and burn up every house, and lynch every  Mormon they find. The militia has been sent to keep order in  Daviess County, but will soon be gone, and the work of destroying  the Mormons begin.\"    \"If they have done as you say they have, pay them in their own  coin,\" I said.    The company then passed on, and I returned with a heavy heart to  my friends. I advised making an immediate start for home, and in  a few minutes we were on our way.    While coming up from home we had found four bee trees, that we  left standing, intending to cut them down and get the honey as we  went back. When we got on the prairie, which was about eight  miles across, the men with me wanted to go and get the honey. I  was fearful that the people I had met in the morning would attack  the settlements, and I wanted to go directly home and let trees  and honey alone.    While we were talking the matter over a single blackbird came to  us, apparently in great distress. It flew around each one of us,  and would alight on the head of each one of our horses, and  especially on my horses' heads, and it even came and alighted on  my hat, and would squeak as though it was in pain, and turn its  feathers up, and acted as if it wished to warn us of danger. Then  it flew off towards the settlements where I wished to go.    All admitted that these were strange actions for a bird, but they  still insisted on going to cut the bee trees. I was persuaded to  go with them. We had gone a quarter of a mile further when the  blackbird returned to us and went through the same performance as  before, and again flew off toward the settlement.    This was to me a warning to go home at once; that there was  danger there to my family. I then proposed that we all join in  prayer. We did so, and I prayed to the Author of our existence,  and asked that if it was His will for us to go home at once, and  if the"]]]
