Then she talked about Kew again, saying how wonderful the  hot-houses were, with palms and all sorts of wonderful things, and a  lily as big as a parlour table, and the view over the river. George was  very good, Alice told me. He was quite taken aback at first, as the old  woman had promised faithfully to be as nice as ever she could be; but  then he said, gently but firmly, \"Well, mother, we must go to Kew some  other day, as Alice has set her heart on Hampton for to-day, and I want  to see it myself!\" All Mrs. Murry did was to snort, and look at the girl  like vinegar, and just then the char-a-banc came up, and they had to  scramble for their seats. Mrs. Murry grumbled to herself in an  indistinct sort of voice all the way to Hampton Court. Alice couldn't  very well make out what she said, but now and then she seemed to hear  bits of sentences, like: _Pity to grow old, if sons grow bold_; and  _Honour thy father and mother_; and _Lie on the shelf, said the  housewife to the old shoe, and the wicked son to his mother_; and _I  gave you milk and you give me the go-by_. Alice thought they must be  proverbs (except the Commandment, of course), as George was always  saying how old-fashioned his mother is; but she says there were so many  of them, and all pointed at her and George, that she thinks now Mrs.  Murry must have made them up as they drove along. She says it would be  just like her to do it, being old-fashioned, and ill-natured too, and  fuller of talk than a butcher on Saturday night. Well, they got to  Hampton at last, and Alice thought the place would please her, perhaps,  and they might have some enjoyment. But she did nothing but grumble, and  out loud too, so that people looked at them, and a woman said, so that  they could hear, \"Ah well, they'll be old themselves some day,\" which  made Alice very angry, for, as she said, they weren't doing anything.  When they showed her the chestnut avenue in Bushey Park, she said it was  so long and straight that it made her quite dull to look at it, and she  thought the deer (you know how pretty they are, really) looked thin and  miserable, as if they would be all the better for a good feed of  hog-wash, with plenty of meal in it. She said she knew they weren't  happy by the look in their eyes, which seemed to tell her that their  keepers beat them. It was the same with everything; she said she  remembered market-gardens in Hammersmith and Gunnersbury that had a  better show of flowers, and when they took her to the place where the  water is, under the trees, she burst out with its being rather hard to  tramp her off her legs to show her a common canal, with not so much as a  barge on it to liven it up a bit. She went on like that the whole day,  and Alice told me she was only too thankful to get home and get rid of  her. Wasn't it wretched for the girl?'    'It must have been, indeed. But what happened last Sunday?'    'That's the most extraordinary thing of all. I noticed that Alice was  rather queer in her manner this morning; she was a longer time washing  up the breakfast things, and she answered me quite sharply when I called  to her to ask when she would be ready to help me with the wash; and when  I went into the kitchen to see about something, I noticed that she was  going about her work in a sulky sort of way. So I asked her what was the  matter, and then it all came out. I could scarcely believe my own ears  when she mumbled out something about Mrs. Murry thinking she could do  very much better for herself; but I asked her one question after another  till I had it all out of her. It just shows one how foolish and  empty-headed these girls are. I told her she was no better than a  weather-cock. If you will believe me, that horrid old woman was quite  another person when Alice went to see her the other night. Why, I can't  think, but so she was. She told the girl how pretty she was; what a neat  figure she had; how well she walked; and how she'd known many a girl not  half so clever or well-looking earning her twenty-five or thirty pounds  a year, and with good families. She seems to have gone into all sorts of  details, and made elaborate calculations as to what she would be able to  save, \"with decent folks, who don't screw, and pinch, and lock up  everything in the house,\" and then she went off into a lot of  hypocritical nonsense about how fond she was of Alice, and how she  could go to her grave in peace, knowing how happy her dear George would  be with such a good wife, and about her savings from good wages helping  to set up a little home, ending up with \"And, if you take an old woman's  advice, deary, it won't be long before you hear the marriage bells.\"'    'I see,' said Darnell; 'and the upshot of it all is, I suppose, that the  girl is thoroughly dissatisfied?'    'Yes, she is so young and silly. I talked to her, and reminded her of  how nasty old Mrs. Murry had been, and told her that she might change  her place and change for the worse. I think I have persuaded her to  think it over quietly, at all events. Do you know what it is, Edward? I  have an idea. I believe that wicked old woman is trying to get Alice to  leave us, that she may tell her son how changeable she is; and I suppose  she would make up some of her stupid old proverbs: \"A changeable wife, a  troublesome life,\" or some nonsense of the kind. Horrid old thing!'    'Well, well,' said Darnell, 'I hope she won't go, for your sake. It  would be such a bother for you, hunting for a fresh servant.'    He refilled his pipe and smoked placidly, refreshed somewhat after the  emptiness and the burden of the day. The French window was wide open,  and now at last there came a breath of quickening air, distilled by the  night from such trees as still wore green in that arid valley. The song  to which Darnell had listened in rapture, and now the breeze, which even  in that dry, grim suburb still bore the word of the woodland, had  summoned the dream to his eyes, and he meditated over matters that his  lips could not express.    'She must, indeed, be a villainous old woman,' he said at length.    'Old Mrs. Murry? Of course she is; the mischievous old thing! Trying to  take the girl from a comfortable place where she is happy.'    'Yes; and not to like Hampton Court! That shows how bad she must be,  more than anything.'    'It is beautiful, isn't it?'    'I shall never forget the first time I saw it. It was soon after I went  into the City; the first year. I had my holidays in July, and I was  getting such a small salary that I couldn't think of going away to the  seaside, or anything like that. I remember one of the other men wanted  me to come with him on a walking tour in Kent. I should have liked that,  but the money wouldn't run to it. And do you know what I did? I lived in  Great College Street then, and the first day I was off, I stayed in bed  till past dinner-time, and lounged about in an arm-chair with a pipe all  the afternoon. I had got a new kind of tobacco--one and four for the  two-ounce packet--much dearer than I could afford to smoke, and I was  enjoying it immensely. It was awfully hot, and when I shut the window  and drew down the red blind it grew hotter; at five o'clock the room was  like an oven. But I was so pleased at not having to go into the City,  that I didn't mind anything, and now and again I read bits from a queer  old book that had belonged to my poor dad. I couldn't make out what a  lot of it meant, but it fitted in somehow, and I read and smoked till  tea-time. Then I went out for a walk, thinking I should be better for a  little fresh air before I went to bed; and I went wandering away, not  much noticing where I was going, turning here and there as the fancy  took me. I must have gone miles and miles, and a good many of them round  and round, as they say they do in Australia if they lose their way in  the bush; and I am sure I couldn't have gone exactly the same way all  over again for any money. Anyhow, I was still in the streets when the  twilight came on, and the lamp-lighters were trotting round from one  lamp to another. It was a wonderful night: I wish you had been there, my  dear.'    'I was quite a little girl then.'    'Yes, I suppose you were. Well, it was a wonderful night. I remember, I  was walking in a little street of little grey houses all alike, with  stucco copings and stucco door-posts; there were brass plates on a lot  of the doors, and one had \"Maker of Shell Boxes\" on it, and I was quite  pleased, as I had often wondered where those boxes and things that you  buy at the seaside came from. A few children were playing about in the  road with some rubbish or other, and men were singing in a small  public-house at the corner, and I happened to look up, and I noticed  what a wonderful colour the sky had turned. I have seen it since, but I  don't think it has ever been quite what it was that night, a dark blue,  glowing like a violet, just as they say the sky looks in foreign  countries. I don't know why, but the sky or something made me feel quite  queer; everything seemed changed in a way I couldn't understand. I  remember, I told an old gentleman I knew then--a friend of my poor  father's, he's been dead for five years, if not more--about how I felt,  and he looked at me and said something about fairyland; I don't know  what he meant, and I dare say I didn't explain myself properly. But, do  you know, for a moment or two I felt as if that little back street was  beautiful, and the noise of the children and the men in the public-house  seemed to fit in with the sky and become part of it. You know that old  saying about \"treading on air\" when one is glad! Well, I really felt  like that as I walked,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25023"],[0,"The Biography of a Grizzly (#9)"],[1," fork, and the lot was drawn.  The strength and speed were gone from his once mighty limbs; he took three  times as long as he once would to mount each well-known ridge, and as he  went he glanced backward from time to time to know if he were pursued. Away  up the head of the little branch were the Shoshones, bleak, forbidding; no  enemies were there, and the Park was beyond it all--on, on he must go. But  as he climbed with shaky limbs, and short uncertain steps, the west wind  brought the odor of Death Gulch, that fearful little valley where  everything was dead, where the very air was deadly. It used to disgust him  and drive him away, but now Wahb felt that it had a message for him; he was  drawn by it. It was in his line of flight, and he hobbled slowly toward  the place. He went nearer, nearer, until he stood upon the entering ledge.  A Vulture that had descended to feed on one of the victims was slowly going  to sleep on the untouched carcass. Wahb swung his great grizzled muzzle and  his long white beard in the wind. The odor that he once had hated was  attractive now. There was a strange biting quality in the air. His body  craved it. For it seemed to numb his pain and it promised sleep, as it did  that day when first he saw the place.        [Illustration]        [Illustration]    Far below him, to the right and to the left and on and on as far as the eye  could reach, was the great kingdom that once had been his: where he had  lived for years in the glory of his strength; where none had dared to meet  him face to face. The whole earth could show no view more beautiful. But  Wahb had no thought of its beauty; he only knew that it was a good land to  live in; that it had been his, but that now it was gone, for his strength  was gone, and he was flying to seek a place where he could rest and be at  peace.    Away over the Shoshones, indeed, was the road to the Park, but it was far,  far away, with a doubtful end to the long, doubtful journey. But why so  far? Here in this little gulch was all he sought; here were peace and  painless sleep. He knew it; for his nose, his never-erring nose, said,  \"_Here! here now!_\"    He paused a moment at the gate, and as he stood the wind-borne fumes began  their subtle work. Five were the faithful wardens of his life, and the best  and trustiest of them all flung open wide the door he long had kept. A  moment still Wahb stood in doubt. His lifelong guide was silent now, had  given up his post. But another sense he felt within. The Angel of the Wild  Things was standing there, beckoning, in the little vale. Wahb did not  understand. He had no eyes to see the tear in the Angel's eyes, nor the  pitying smile that was surely on his lips. He could not even see the Angel.  But he _felt_ him beckoning, beckoning.        [Illustration: \"HE PAUSED A MOMENT AT THE GATE.\"]    A rush of his ancient courage surged in the Grizzly's rugged breast. He  turned aside into the little gulch. The deadly vapors entered in, filled  his huge chest and tingled in his vast, heroic limbs as he calmly lay down  on the rocky, herbless floor and as gently went to sleep, as he did that  day in his Mother's arms by the Graybull, long ago.
