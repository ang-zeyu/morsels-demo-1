Hence  no doubt the need for that curious apparatus which no standing or  moving upon ordinary surfaces could explain, as was said above, when  we were wondering what the shifting, swaying, dangerous body might be  on which the larva would have to establish itself later. This body is  a hair of a Bee who makes a thousand rapid journeys, now diving into  her narrow galleries, now forcing her way down the tight throat of a  corolla, and who never rests except to brush herself with her feet and  remove the specks of dust collected by the down which covers her.    We can now easily understand the use of the projecting crescent whose  two horns, by closing together, are able to take hold of a hair more  easily than the most delicate tweezers; we perceive the full value of  the tenacious adhesive provided by the anus to save the tiny creature,  at the least sign of danger, from an imminent fall; we realize lastly  the useful function that may be fulfilled by the elastic cirri of the  flanks and legs, which are an absolute and most embarrassing  superfluity when walking upon a smooth surface, but which, in the  present case, penetrate like so many probes into the thickness of the  Anthophora's down and serve as it were to anchor the Sitaris-larva in  position. The more we consider this arrangement, which seems modelled  by a blind caprice so long as the grub drags itself laboriously over a  smooth surface, the more do we marvel at the means, as effective as  they are varied, which are lavished upon this fragile creature to help  it to preserve its unstable equilibrium.    Before I describe what becomes of the Sitaris-grubs on leaving the  body of the Anthophorae, I must not omit to mention one very  remarkable peculiarity. All the Bees invaded by these grubs that have  hitherto been observed have, without one exception, been male  Anthophorae. Those whom I drew from their lurking-places were males;  those whom I caught upon the flowers were males; and, in spite of the  most active search, I failed to find a single female at liberty. The  cause of this total absence of females is easy to understand.    If we remove a few clods from the area occupied by the nests, we see  that, though all the males have already opened and abandoned their  cells, the females, on the contrary, are still enclosed in theirs, but  on the point of soon taking flight. This appearance of the males  almost a month before the emergence of the females is not peculiar to  the Anthophorae; I have observed it in many other Bees and  particularly in the Three-horned Osmia (_O. tricornis_), who inhabits  the same site as the Hairy-footed Anthophora (_A. pilipes_). The males  of the Osmia make their appearance even before those of the Anthophora  and at so early a season that the young Sitaris-larvae are perhaps not  yet aroused by the instinctive impulse which urges them to activity.  It is no doubt to their precocious awakening that the males of the  Osmia owe their ability to traverse with impunity the corridors in  which the young Sitaris-grubs are heaped together, without having the  latter fasten to their fleece; at least, I cannot otherwise explain  the absence of these larvae from the backs of the male Osmiae, since,  when we place them artificially in the presence of these Bees, they  fasten on them as readily as on the Anthophorae.    The emergence from the common site begun by the male Osmiae is  continued by the male Anthophorae and ends with the almost  simultaneous emergence of the female Osmiae and Anthophorae. I was  easily able to verify this sequence by observing at my own place, in  the early spring, the dates at which the cells, collected during the  previous autumn, were broken.    At the moment of their emergence, the male Anthophorae, passing  through the galleries in which the Sitaris-larvae are waiting on the  alert, must pick up a certain number of them; and those among them  who, by entering empty corridors, escape the enemy on this first  occasion will not evade him for long, for the rain, the chilly air and  the darkness bring them back to their former homes, where they take  shelter now in one gallery, now in another, during a great part of  April. This constant traffic of the males in the entrance-lobbies of  their houses and the prolonged stay which the bad weather often  compels them to make provide the Sitares with the most favourable  opportunity for slipping into the Bees' fur and taking up their  position. Moreover, when this state of affairs has lasted a month or  so, there can be only very few if any larvae left wandering about  without having attained their end. At that period I was unable to find  them anywhere save on the body of the male Anthophora.    It is therefore extremely probable that, on their emergence, which  takes place as May draws near, the female Anthophorae do not pick up  Sitaris-larvae in the corridors, or pick up only a number which will  not compare with that carried by the males. In fact, the first females  that I was able to observe in April, in the actual neighbourhood of  the nests, were free from these larvae. Nevertheless it is upon the  females that the Sitaris-larvae must finally establish themselves, for  the males upon whom they now are cannot introduce them into the cells,  since they take no part in the building or provisioning. There is  therefore, at a given moment, a transfer of Sitaris-larvae from the  male Anthophorae to the females; and this transfer is, beyond a doubt,  effected during the union of the sexes. The female finds in the male's  embraces both life and death for her offspring; at the moment when she  surrenders herself to the male for the preservation of her race, the  vigilant parasites pass from the male to the female, with the  extermination of that same race in view.    In support of these deductions, here is a fairly conclusive  experiment, though it reproduces the natural circumstances but  roughly. On a female taken in her cell and therefore free from  Sitares, I place a male who is infested with them; and I keep the two  sexes in contact, suppressing their unruly movements as far as I am  able. After fifteen or twenty minutes of this enforced proximity, the  female is invaded by one or more of the larvae which at first were on  the male. True, experiment does not always succeed under these  imperfect conditions.    By watching at Avignon the few Anthophorae that I succeeded in  discovering, I was able to detect the precise moment of their work;  and on the following Thursday,[5] the 21st of May, I repaired in all  haste to Carpentras, to witness, if possible, the entrance of the  Sitares into the Bee's cells. I was not mistaken: the works were in  full swing.    [Footnote 5: Thursday is the weekly holiday in French  schools.--_Translator's Note_.]    In front of a high expanse of earth, a swarm stimulated by the sun,  which floods it with light and heat, is dancing a crazy ballet. It is  a hover of Anthophorae, a few feet thick and covering an area which  matches the sort of house-front formed by the perpendicular soil. From  the tumultuous heart of the cloud rises a monotonous, threatening  murmur, while the bewildered eye strays through the inextricable  evolutions of the eager throng. With the rapidity of a lightning-flash  thousands of Anthophorae are incessantly flying off and scattering  over the country-side in search of booty; thousands of others also are  incessantly arriving, laden with honey or mortar, and keeping up the  formidable proportions of the swarm.    I was at that time something of a novice as regards the nature of  these insects:    \"Woe,\" said I to myself, \"woe to the reckless wight bold enough to  enter the heart of this swarm and, above all, to lay a rash hand upon  the dwellings under construction! Forthwith surrounded by the furious  host, he would expiate his rash attempt, stabbed by a thousand  stings!\"    At this thought, rendered still more alarming by the recollection of  certain misadventures of which I had been the victim when seeking to  observe too closely the combs of the Hornet (_Vespa crabro_), I felt a  shiver of apprehension pass through my body.    Yet, to obtain light upon the question which brings me hither, I must  needs penetrate the fearsome swarm; I must stand for whole hours,  perhaps all day, watching the works which I intend to upset; lens in  hand, I must scrutinize, unmoved amid the whirl, the things that are  happening in the cells. The use moreover of a mask, of gloves, of a  covering of any kind is impracticable, for utter dexterity of the  fingers and complete liberty of sight are essential to the  investigations which I have to make. No matter: even though I leave  this wasps'-nest with a face swollen beyond recognition, I must to-day  obtain a decisive solution of the problem which has preoccupied me too  long.    A few strokes of the net, aimed, beyond the limits of the swarm, at  the Anthophorae on their way to the harvest or returning, soon  informed me that the Sitaris-larvae are perched on the thorax, as I  expected, occupying the same position as on the males. The  circumstances therefore could not be more favourable. We will inspect  the cells without further delay.    My preparations are made at once: I button my clothes tightly, so as  to afford the Bees the least possible opportunity, and I enter the  heart of the swarm. A few blows of the mattock, which arouse a far  from reassuring crescendo in the humming of the Anthophorae, soon  place me in possession of a lump of earth; and I beat a hasty retreat,  greatly astonished to find myself still safe and sound and unpursued.  But the lump of earth which I have removed is from a part too near the  surface; it contains nothing but Osmia-cells, which do not interest me  for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2788"],[0,"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boys (#9)"],[1,"go on.\"    Nat's face had brightened more and more as he listened, for, small as  the list of his learning was, it cheered him immensely to feel that  he had anything to fall back upon. \"Yes, I can keep my temper father's  beating taught me that; and I can fiddle, though I don't know where the  Bay of Biscay is,\" he thought, with a sense of comfort impossible to  express. Then he said aloud, and so earnestly that Demi heard him:    \"I do want to learn, and I will try. I never went to school, but I  couldn't help it; and if the fellows don't laugh at me, I guess I'll get  on first rate you and the lady are so good to me.\"    \"They shan't laugh at you; if they do, I'll I'll tell them not to,\"  cried Demi, quite forgetting where he was.    The class stopped in the middle of 7 times 9, and everyone looked up to  see what was going on.    Thinking that a lesson in learning to help one another was better than  arithmetic just then, Mr. Bhaer told them about Nat, making such an  interesting and touching little story out of it that the good-hearted  lads all promised to lend him a hand, and felt quite honored to be  called upon to impart their stores of wisdom to the chap who fiddled so  capitally. This appeal established the right feeling among them, and Nat  had few hindrances to struggle against, for every one was glad to give  him a \"boost\" up the ladder of learning.    Till he was stronger, much study was not good for him, however, and Mrs.  Jo found various amusements in the house for him while others were at  their books. But his garden was his best medicine, and he worked away  like a beaver, preparing his little farm, sowing his beans, watching  eagerly to see them grow, and rejoicing over each green leaf and slender  stock that shot up and flourished in the warm spring weather. Never  was a garden more faithfully hoed; Mr. Bhaer really feared that nothing  would find time to grow, Nat kept up such a stirring of the soil; so he  gave him easy jobs in the flower garden or among the strawberries, where  he worked and hummed as busily as the bees booming all about him.    \"This is the crop I like best,\" Mrs. Bhaer used to say, as she pinched  the once thin cheeks, now getting plump and ruddy, or stroked the bent  shoulders that were slowly straightening up with healthful work, good  food, and the absence of that heavy burden, poverty.    Demi was his little friend, Tommy his patron, and Daisy the comforter of  all his woes; for, though the children were younger than he, his timid  spirit found a pleasure in their innocent society, and rather shrunk  from the rough sports of the elder lads. Mr. Laurence did not forget  him, but sent clothes and books, music and kind messages, and now and  then came out to see how his boy was getting on, or took him into town  to a concert; on which occasions Nat felt himself translated into the  seventh heaven of bliss, for he went to Mr. Laurence's great house, saw  his pretty wife and little fairy of a daughter, had a good dinner, and  was made so comfortable, that he talked and dreamed of it for days and  nights afterward.    It takes so little to make a child happy that it is a pity, in a world  so full of sunshine and pleasant things, that there should be any  wistful faces, empty hands, or lonely little hearts. Feeling this, the  Bhaers gathered up all the crumbs they could find to feed their flock of  hungry sparrows, for they were not rich, except in charity. Many of  Mrs. Jo's friends who had nurseries sent her they toys of which their  children so soon tired, and in mending these Nat found an employment  that just suited him. He was very neat and skillful with those slender  fingers of his, and passed many a rainy afternoon with his gum-bottle,  paint-box, and knife, repairing furniture, animals, and games, while  Daisy was dressmaker to the dilapidated dolls. As fast as the toys were  mended, they were put carefully away in a certain drawer which was  to furnish forth a Christmas-tree for all the poor children of the  neighborhood, that being the way the Plumfield boys celebrated the  birthday of Him who loved the poor and blessed the little ones.    Demi was never tired of reading and explaining his favorite books, and  many a pleasant hour did they spend in the old willow, revelling over  \"Robinson Crusoe,\" \"Arabian Nights,\" \"Edgeworth's Tales,\" and the other  dear immortal stories that will delight children for centuries to come.  This opened a new world to Nat, and his eagerness to see what came next  in the story helped him on till he could read as well as anybody, and  felt so rich and proud with his new accomplishment, that there was  danger of his being as much of a bookworm as Demi.    Another helpful thing happened in a most unexpected and agreeable  manner. Several of the boys were \"in business,\" as they called it, for  most of them were poor, and knowing that they would have their own way  to make by and by, the Bhaers encouraged any efforts at independence.  Tommy sold his eggs; Jack speculated in live stock; Franz helped in  the teaching, and was paid for it; Ned had a taste for carpentry, and a  turning-lathe was set up for him in which he turned all sorts of useful  or pretty things, and sold them; while Demi constructed water-mills,  whirligigs, and unknown machines of an intricate and useless nature, and  disposed of them to the boys.    \"Let him be a mechanic if he likes,\" said Mr. Bhaer. \"Give a boy a  trade, and he is independent. Work is wholesome, and whatever talent  these lads possess, be it for poetry or ploughing, it shall be  cultivated and made useful to them if possible.\"    So, when Nat came running to him one day to ask with an excited face:    \"Can I go and fiddle for some people who are to have a picnic in our  woods? They will pay me, and I'd like to earn some money as the other  boys do, and fiddling is the only way I know how to do it.\"    Mr. Bhaer answered readily:    \"Go, and welcome. It is an easy and a pleasant way to work, and I am  glad it is offered you.\"    Nat went, and did so well that when he came home he had two dollars in  his pocket, which he displayed with intense satisfaction, as he told how  much he had enjoyed the afternoon, how kind the young people were, and  how they had praised his dance music, and promised to have him again.    \"It is so much nicer than fiddling in the street, for then I got none  of the money, and now I have it all, and a good time besides. I'm in  business now as well as Tommy and Jack, and I like it ever so much,\"  said Nat, proudly patting the old pocketbook, and feeling like a  millionaire already.    He was in business truly, for picnics were plenty as summer opened,  and Nat's skill was in great demand. He was always at liberty to go if  lessons were not neglected, and if the picnickers were respectable young  people. For Mr. Bhaer explained to him that a good plain education is  necessary for everyone, and that no amount of money should hire him to  go where he might be tempted to do wrong. Nat quite agreed to this, and  it was a pleasant sight to see the innocent-hearted lad go driving away  in the gay wagons that stopped at the gate for him, or to hear him come  fiddling home tired but happy, with his well-earned money in one pocket,  and some \"goodies\" from the feast for Daisy or little Ted, whom he never  forgot.    \"I'm going to save up till I get enough to buy a violin for myself, and  then I can earn my own living, can't I?\" he used to say, as he brought  his dollars to Mr. Bhaer to keep.    \"I hope so, Nat; but we must get you strong and hearty first, and put a  little more knowledge into this musical head of yours. Then Mr. Laurie  will find you a place somewhere, and in a few years we will all come to  hear you play in public.\"    With much congenial work, encouragement, and hope, Nat found life  getting easier and happier every day, and made such progress in his  music lessons that his teacher forgave his slowness in some other  things, knowing very well that where the heart is the mind works best.  The only punishment the boy ever needed for neglect of more important  lessons was to hang up the fiddle and the bow for a day. The fear of  losing his bosom friend entirely made him go at his books with a will;  and having proved that he could master the lessons, what was the use of  saying \"I can't?\"    Daisy had a great love of music, and a great reverence for any one who  could make it, and she was often found sitting on the stairs outside  Nat's door while he was practising. This pleased him very much, and he  played his best for that one quiet little listener; for she never would  come in, but preferred to sit sewing her gay patchwork, or tending one  of her many dolls, with an expression of dreamy pleasure on her face  that made Aunt Jo say, with tears in her eyes: \"So like my Beth,\" and  go softly by, lest even her familiar presence mar the child's sweet  satisfaction.    Nat was very fond of Mrs. Bhaer, but found something even more  attractive in the good professor, who took fatherly care of the shy  feeble boy, who had barely escaped with his life from the rough sea on  which his little boat had been tossing rudderless for twelve years. Some  good angel must have been watching over him, for, though his body had  suffered, his soul seemed to have taken little harm, and came ashore as  innocent as a shipwrecked baby. Perhaps his love of music kept it sweet  in spite of the discord all about him; Mr. Laurie said so, and he ought  to know. However that might be, Father Bhaer took pleasure in fostering  poor Nat's virtues, and in curing his faults, finding his new pupil as  docile and affectionate as a girl. He often called Nat his \"daughter\"  when speaking of him to Mrs. Jo, and she used to laugh at his fancy, for  Madame liked manly boys, and thought Nat amiable but weak, though you  never would have guessed it, for she petted him as she did Daisy, and he  thought"]]]
