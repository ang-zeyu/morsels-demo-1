To be scrutinized  and scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you, by inch and  line--'tis degrading! Here, they find you too hollow; there, too  prominent. They recognize your strong and weak points. See, now, when we  leave the measurer's hands, we are like those strongholds whose angles  and different thicknesses have been ascertained by a spy.\"    \"In truth, my dear Porthos, you possess ideas entirely original.\"    \"Ah! you see when a man is an engineer--\"    \"And has fortified Belle-Isle--'tis natural, my friend.\"    \"Well, I had an idea, which would doubtless have proved a good one, but  for Mouston's carelessness.\"    D'Artagnan glanced at Mouston, who replied by a slight movement of his  body, as if to say, \"You will see whether I am at all to blame in all  this.\"    \"I congratulated myself, then,\" resumed Porthos, \"at seeing Mouston get  fat; and I did all I could, by means of substantial feeding, to make him  stout--always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in girth,  and could then be measured in my stead.\"    \"Ah!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"I see--that spared you both time and  humiliation.\"    \"Consider my joy when, after a year and a half's judicious feeding--for  I used to feed him up myself--the fellow--\"    \"Oh! I lent a good hand myself, monsieur,\" said Mouston, humbly.    \"That's true. Consider my joy when, one morning, I perceived Mouston was  obliged to squeeze in, as I once did myself, to get through the little  secret door that those fools of architects had made in the chamber of  the late Madame du Vallon, in the chateau of Pierrefonds. And, by the  way, about that door, my friend, I should like to ask you, who know  everything, why these wretches of architects, who ought to have the  compasses run into them, just to remind them, came to make doorways  through which nobody but thin people can pass?\"    \"Oh, those doors,\" answered D'Artagnan, \"were meant for gallants, and  they have generally slight and slender figures.\"    \"Madame du Vallon had no gallant!\" answered Porthos, majestically.    \"Perfectly true, my friend,\" resumed D'Artagnan; \"but the architects  were probably making their calculations on a basis of the probability of  your marrying again.\"    \"Ah! that is possible,\" said Porthos. \"And now I have received an  explanation of how it is that doorways are made too narrow, let us  return to the subject of Mouston's fatness. But see how the two things  apply to each other. I have always noticed that people's ideas run  parallel. And so, observe this phenomenon, D'Artagnan. I was talking to  you of Mouston, who is fat, and it led us on to Madame du Vallon--\"    \"Who was thin?\"    \"Hum! Is it not marvelous?\"    \"My dear friend, a _savant_ of my acquaintance, M. Costar, has made the  same observation as you have, and he calls the process by some Greek  name which I forget.\"    \"What! my remark is not then original?\" cried Porthos, astounded. \"I  thought I was the discoverer.\"    \"My friend, the fact was known before Aristotle's days--that is to say,  nearly two thousand years ago.\"    \"Well, well, 'tis no less true,\" said Porthos, delighted at the idea of  having jumped to a conclusion so closely in agreement with the greatest  sages of antiquity.    \"Wonderfully--but suppose we return to Mouston. It seems to me, we have  left him fattening under our very eyes.\"    \"Yes, monsieur,\" said Mouston.    \"Well,\" said Porthos, \"Mouston fattened so well, that he gratified all  my hopes, by reaching my standard; a fact of which I was well able to  convince myself, by seeing the rascal, one day, in a waistcoat of mine,  which he had turned into a coat--a waistcoat, the mere embroidery of  which was worth a hundred pistoles.\"    \"'Twas only to try it on, monsieur,\" said Mouston.    \"From that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my  tailors, and to have him measured instead of myself.\"    \"A capital idea, Porthos; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than  you.\"    \"Exactly! They measured him down to the ground, and the end of the skirt  came just below my knee.\"    \"What a marvelous man you are, Porthos! Such a thing could happen only  to you.\"    \"Ah! yes; pay your compliments; you have ample grounds to go upon. It  was exactly at that time--that is to say, nearly two years and a half  ago--that I set out for Belle-Isle, instructing Mouston (so as always  to have, in every event, a pattern of every fashion) to have a coat made  for himself every month.\"    \"And did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions? Ah! that was  anything but right, Mouston.\"    \"No, monsieur, quite the contrary; quite the contrary!\"    \"No, he never forgot to have his coats made; but he forgot to inform me  that he had got stouter!\"    \"But it was not my fault, monsieur! your tailor never told me.\"    \"And this to such an extent, monsieur,\" continued Porthos, \"that the  fellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth, and so my last  dozen coats are all too large, from a foot to a foot and a half.\"    \"But the rest; those which were made when you were of the same size?\"    \"They are no longer the fashion, my dear friend. Were I to put them on,  I should look like a fresh arrival from Siam; and as though I had been  two years away from court.\"    \"I understand your difficulty. You have how many new suits?  nine? thirty-six? and yet not one to wear. Well, you must have a  thirty-seventh made, and give the thirty-six to Mouston.\"    \"Ah! monsieur!\" said Mouston, with a gratified air. \"The truth is, that  monsieur has always been very generous to me.\"    \"Do you mean to insinuate that I hadn't that idea, or that I was  deterred by the expense? But it wants only two days to the _fete_; I  received the invitation yesterday; made Mouston post hither with my  wardrobe, and only this morning discovered my misfortune; and from now  till the day after to-morrow, there isn't a single fashionable tailor  who will undertake to make me a suit.\"    \"That is to say, one covered all over with gold, isn't it?\"    \"I wish it so! undoubtedly, all over.\"    \"Oh, we shall manage it. You won't leave for three days. The invitations  are for Wednesday, and this is only Sunday morning.\"    \"'Tis true; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four  hours beforehand.\"    \"How, Aramis?\"    \"Yes, it was Aramis who brought me the invitation.\"    \"Ah! to be sure, I see. You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet?\"    \"By no means! by the king, dear friend. The letter bears the following  as large as life: 'M. le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has  condescended to place him on the invitation list--'\"    \"Very good; but you leave with M. Fouquet?\"    \"And when I think,\" cried Porthos, stamping on the floor, \"when I think  I shall have no clothes, I am ready to burst with rage! I should like to  strangle somebody or smash something!\"    \"Neither strangle anybody nor smash anything, Porthos; I will manage it  all; put on one of your thirty-six suits, and come with me to a tailor.\"    \"Pooh! my agent has seen them all this morning.\"    \"Even M. Percerin?\"    \"Who is M. Percerin?\"    \"Oh! only the king's tailor!\"    \"Oh, ah, yes,\" said Porthos, who wished to appear to know the king's  tailor, but now heard his name mentioned for the first time; \"to M.  Percerin's, by Jove! I was afraid he would be too busy.\"    \"Doubtless he will be; but be at ease, Porthos; he will do for me  what he wouldn't do for another. Only you must allow yourself to be  measured!\"    \"Ah!\" said Porthos, with a sigh, \"'tis vexatious, but what would you  have me do?\"    \"Do? As others do; as the king does.\"    \"What! do they measure the king, too? does he put up with it?\"    \"The king is a beau, my good friend, and so are you, too, whatever you  may say about it.\"    Porthos smiled triumphantly. \"Let us go to the king's tailor,\" he said;  \"and since he measures the king, I think, by my faith, I may do worse  than allow him to measure _me!_\"        Chapter III. Who Messire Jean Percerin Was.    The king's tailor, Messire Jean Percerin, occupied a rather large house  in the Rue St. Honore, near the Rue de l'Arbre Sec. He was a man  of great taste in elegant stuffs, embroideries, and velvets, being  hereditary tailor to the king. The preferment of his house reached as  far back as the time of Charles IX.; from whose reign dated, as we know,  fancy in _bravery_ difficult enough to gratify. The Percerin of that  period was a Huguenot, like Ambrose Pare, and had been spared by the  Queen of Navarre, the beautiful Margot, as they used to write and say,  too, in those days; because, in sooth, he was the only one who could  make for her those wonderful riding-habits which she so loved to wear,  seeing that they were marvelously well suited to hide certain anatomical  defects, which the Queen of Navarre used very studiously to conceal.  Percerin being saved, made, out of gratitude, some beautiful black  bodices, very inexpensively indeed, for Queen Catherine, who ended by  being pleased at the preservation of a Huguenot people, on whom she had  long looked with detestation. But Percerin was a very prudent man;  and having heard it said that there was no more dangerous sign for a  Protestant than to be smiled up on by Catherine, and having observed  that her smiles were more frequent than usual, he speedily turned  Catholic with all his family; and having thus become irreproachable,  attained the lofty position of master tailor to the Crown of France.  Under Henry III., gay king as he was, this position was as grand as the  height of one of the loftiest peaks of the Cordilleras. Now Percerin had  been a clever man all his life, and by way of keeping up his reputation  beyond the grave, took very good care not to make a bad death of it, and  so contrived to die very skillfully; and that at the very moment he felt  his powers of invention declining.

The fluids secreted from the mucous membranes of animals are of various  kinds and consistencies. Hair, silk, scales, horns, fingernails, are owing  to natural processes. Gall-stones, stones found in the intestines of  horses, scurf of the skin in leprosy, stones of the kidnies and bladder,  the callus from the inflamed periosteum, which unites broken bones, the  calcareous cement, which repairs the injured shells of snails, the  calcareous crust on the eggs of birds, the annually renewed shells of  crabs, are all instances of productions from mucous membranes, afterwards  indurated by absorption of their thinner parts.    All these concretions contain phosphoric acid, mucus, and calcareous earth  in different proportions; and are probably so far analogous in respect to  their component parts as well as their mode of formation. Some calcareous  earth has been discovered after putrefaction in the coagulable lymph of  animals. Fordyce's Elements of Practice. A little calcareous earth was  detected by Scheel or Bergman in the calculus of the bladder with much  phosphoric acid, and a great quantity of phosphoric acid is shewn to exist  in oyster-shells by their becoming luminous on exposing them a while to the  sun's light after calcination; as in the experiments of Wilson. Botanic  Garden, P. 1. Canto 1. l. 182, note. The exchange of which phosphoric acid  for carbonic acid, or fixed air, converts shells into limestone, producing  mountains of marble, or calcareous strata.    Now as the hard lumps of calcareous matter, termed crabs' eyes, which are  found in the stomachs of those animals previous to the annual renewal of  their shells, are redissolved, probably by their gastric acid, and again  deposited for that purpose; may it not be concluded, that the stone of the  bladder might be dissolved by the gastric juice of fish of prey, as of  crabs, or pike; or of voracious young birds, as young rooks or hawks, or  even of calves? Could not these experiments be tried by collecting the  gastric juice by putting bits of sponge down the throats of young crows,  and retracting them by a string in the manner of Spallanzani? or putting  pieces of calculus down the throat of a living crow, or pike, and observing  if they become digested? and lastly could not gastric juice, if it should  appear to be a solvent, be injected and born in the bladder without injury  by means of catheters of elastic resin, or caoutchouc?    M. M. Diluents. Cool dress. Frequent change of posture. Frequent horizontal  rest in the day. Bathe the loins every morning with a sponge and cold  water. Aerated alcaline water internally. Abstinence from all fermented or  spirituous liquors. Whatever increases perspiration injures these patients,  as it dissipates the aqueous particles, which ought to dilute the urine.  When the constitution begins to produce gravel, it may I believe be  certainly prevented by a total abstinence from fermented or spirituous  liquors; by drinking much aqueous fluids; as toast and water, tea, milk and  water, lemonade; and lastly by thin clothing, and sleeping on a hardish  bed, that the patient may not lie too long on one side. See Class IV. 2. 2.  2. There is reason to believe, that the daily use of opium contributes to  produce gravel in the kidnies by increasing absorption, when they are  inflamed; in the same manner as is done by fermented or spirituous liquor.  See Class I. 3. 2. 11.    When the kidnies are so obstructed with gravel, that no urine passes into  the bladder; which is known by the external appearance of the lower part of  the abdomen, which, when the bladder is full, seems as if contracted by a  cord between the navel and the bladder; and by the tension on the region of  the bladder distinguishable by the touch; or by the introduction of the  catheter; the following methods of cure are frequently successful.  Venesection to six or eight ounces, ten grains of calomel, and an infusion  of senna with salts and oil, every three hours, till stools are procured.  Then an emetic. After the patient has been thus evacuated, a blister on the  loins should be used; and from ten to twenty electric shocks should be  passed through the kidnies, as large as can be easily borne, once or twice  a day. Along with this method the warm bath should be used for an hour once  or twice a day. After repeated evacuations a clyster, consisting of two  drams of turpentine dissolved by yolk of egg, and sixty drops of tincture  of opium, should be used at night, and repeated, with cathartic medicines  interposed, every night, or alternate nights. Aerated solution of alcali  should be taken internally, and balsam of copaiva, three or four times a  day. Some of these patients recover after having made no water for nine or  ten days.    If a stone sticks in the ureter with incessant vomiting, ten grains of  calomel must be given in small pills as above; and some hours afterwards  infusion of senna and salts and oil, if it can be made to stay on the  stomach. And after the purge has operated four or five times, an opiate is  to be given, if the pain continues, consisting of two grains of opium. If  this does not succeed, ten or twenty electric shocks through the kidney  should be tried, and the purgative repeated, and afterwards the opiate. The  patient should be frequently put into the warm bath for an hour at a time.  Eighty or an hundred drops of laudanum given in a glyster, with two drams  of turpentine, is to be preferred to the two grains given by the stomach as  above, when the pain and vomiting are very urgent.    10. _Calculus vesicae._ Stone of the bladder. The nucleus, or kernel, of  these concretions is always formed in the kidney, as above described; and  passing down the ureter into the bladder, is there perpetually increased by  the mucus and salts secreted from the arterial system, or by the mucus of  the bladder, disposed in concentric strata. The stones found in the bowels  of horses are also formed on a nucleus, and consist of concentric spheres;  as appears in sawing them through the middle. But as these are formed by  the indurated mucus of the intestines alone without the urinary salts, it  is probable a difference would be found on their analysis.    As the stones of the bladder are of various degrees of hardness, and  probably differ from each other in the proportions at least of their  component parts; when a patient, who labours under this afflicting disease,  voids any small bits of gravel; these should be kept in warm solutions of  caustic alcali, or of mild alcali well aerated; and if they dissolve in  these solutions, it would afford greater hopes, that that which remains in  the bladder, might be affected by these medicines taken by the stomach, or  injected into the bladder.    To prevent the increase of a stone in the bladder much diluent drink should  be taken; as half a pint of water warmed to about eighty degrees, three or  four times a day: which will not only prevent the growth of it, by  preventing any microcosmic salts from being precipitated from the urine,  and by keeping the mucus suspended in it; but will also diminish the stone  already formed, by softening, and washing away its surface. To this must be  added cool dress, and cool bed-clothes, as directed above in the calculus  renis.    When the stone is pushed against or into the neck of the bladder, great  pain is produced; this may sometimes be relieved by the introduction of a  bougie to push the stone back into the fundus of the bladder. Sometimes by  change of posture, or by an opiate either taken into the stomach, or by a  clyster.    A dram of sal soda, or of salt of tartar, dissolved in a pint of water, and  well saturated with carbonic acid (fixed air), by means of Dr. Nooth's  glass-apparatus, and drank every day, or twice a day, is the most  efficacious internal medicine yet discovered, which can be easily taken  without any general injury to the constitution. An aerated alcaline water  of this kind is sold under the name of factitious Seltzer water, by J.  Schweppe, at N^o 8, King's-street, Holborn, London; which I am told is  better prepared than can be easily done in the usual glass-vessels,  probably by employing a greater pressure in wooden ones.    Lythotomy is the last recourse. Will the gastric juice of animals dissolve  calculi? Will fermenting vegetable juices, as sweet-wort, or sugar and  water in the act of fermentation with yest, dissolve any kind of animal  concretions?    11. _Calculus arthriticus._ Gout-stones are formed on inflamed membranes,  like those of the kidnies above described, by the too hasty absorption of  the thinner and saline parts of the mucus. Similar concretions have been  produced in the lungs, and even in the pericardium; and it is probable,  that the ossification, as it is called, of the minute arteries, which is  said to attend old age, and to precede some mortifications of the  extremities, may be a process of this kind.    As gout-stones lie near the surface, it is probable, that ether, frequently  applied in their early state, might render them so liquid as to permit  their reabsorption; which the stimulus of the ether might at the same time  encourage.    12. _Rheumatismus chronicus._ Chronic rheumatism. After the acute  rheumatism some inspissated mucus, or material similar to chalk-stones of  the gout, which was secreted on the inflamed membrane, is probably left,  owing to the too hasty absorption of the thinner and saline part of it; and  by lying on the fascia, which covers some of the muscles, pains them, when  they move and rub against it, like any extraneous material.    The pain of the shoulder, which attends inflammations of the upper membrane  of the liver, and the pains of the arms, which attend asthma dolorificum,  or dropsy of the pericardium, are distinguished from the chronic  rheumatism, as in the latter the pain only occurs on moving the"]]]
