But on examining philologically the name Kronos,  Socrates decides that it must really mean Koros, \"not in the sense of  a youth, but signifying the pure and garnished mind\". Therefore,  when people first called Zeus the son of Cronus, they meant nothing  irreverent, but only that Zeus is the child of the pure mind or pure  reason. Not only is this etymological system most pious and consolatory,  but it is, as Socrates adds, of universal application. \"For now I  bethink me of a very new and ingenious notion,... that we may put in and  pull out letters at pleasure, and alter the accents.\"(3)      (1) Rig-Veda Sanhita. Max Muller, p. 59.    (2) Postea, \"Indian Divine Myths\".    (3) Jowett's Plato, vol. i. pp. 632, 670.      Socrates, of course, speaks more than half in irony, but there is a  certain truth in his account of etymological analysis and its dependence  on individual tastes and preconceived theory.    The ancient classical schools of mythological interpretation, though  unscientific and unsuccessful, are not without interest. We find  philosophers and grammarians looking, just as we ourselves are looking,  for some condition of the human intellect out of which the absurd  element in myths might conceivably have sprung. Very naturally the  philosophers supposed that the human beings in whose brain and  speech myths had their origin must have been philosophers like  themselves--intelligent, educated persons. But such persons, they  argued, could never have meant to tell stories about the gods so full of  nonsense and blasphemy.    Therefore the nonsense and blasphemy must originally have had some  harmless, or even praiseworthy, sense. What could that sense have been?  This question each ancient mythologist answered in accordance with his  own taste and prejudices, and above all, and like all other and later  speculators, in harmony with the general tendency of his own studies.  If he lived when physical speculation was coming into fashion, as in  the age of Empedocles, he thought that the Homeric poems must contain a  veiled account of physical philosophy. This was the opinion of Theagenes  of Rhegium, who wrote at a period when a crude physicism was disengaging  itself from the earlier religious and mythical cosmogonic systems of  Greece. Theagenes was shocked by the Homeric description of the battle  in which the gods fought as allies of the Achaeans and Trojans. He  therefore explained away the affair as a veiled account of the strife  of the elements. Such \"strife\" was familiar to readers of the physical  speculations of Empedocles and of Heraclitus, who blamed Homer for his  prayer against Strife.(1)      (1) Is. et Osir., 48.      It did not occur to Theagenes to ask whether any evidence existed  to show that the pre-Homeric Greeks were Empedoclean or Heraclitean  philosophers. He readily proved to himself that Apollo, Helios, and  Hephaestus were allegorical representations, like what such philosophers  would feign,--of fire, that Hera was air, Poseidon water, Artemis the  moon, and the rest he disposed of in the same fashion.(1)      (1) Scholia on Iliad, xx. 67. Dindorf (1877), vol. iv. p. 231. \"This  manner of apologetics is as old as Theagenes of Rhegium. Homer offers  theological doctrine in the guise of physical allegory.\"      Metrodorus, again, turned not only the gods, but the Homeric heroes into  \"elemental combinations and physical agencies\"; for there is nothing new  in the mythological philosophy recently popular, which saw the sun, and  the cloud, and the wind in Achilles, Athene, and Hermes.(1)      (1) Grote, Hist, of Greece, ed. 1869, i. p. 404.      In the Bacchae (291-297), Euripides puts another of the mythological  systems of his own time into the mouth of Cadmus, the Theban king, who  advances a philological explanation of the story that Dionysus was sewn  up in the thigh of Zeus. The most famous of the later theories was that  of Euhemerus (316 B.C.). In a kind of philosophical romance, Euhemerus  declared that he had sailed to some No-man's-land, Panchaea, where he  found the verity about mythical times engraved on pillars of bronze.  This truth he published in the Sacra Historia, where he rationalised  the fables, averring that the gods had been men, and that the myths were  exaggerated and distorted records of facts. (See Eusebius, Praep. E.,  ii 55.) The Abbe Banier (La Mythologie expliquee par l'Histoire, Paris,  1738, vol. ii. p. 218) attempts the defence of Euhemerus, whom most of  the ancients regarded as an atheist. There was an element of truth in  his romantic hypothesis.(1)      (1) See Block, Euhemere et sa Doctrine, Mons, 1876.      Sometimes the old stories were said to conceal a moral, sometimes a  physical, sometimes a mystical or Neo-platonic sort of meaning. As  every apologist interpreted the legends in his own fashion, the  interpretations usually disagreed and killed each other. Just as one  modern mythologist sees the wind in Aeetes and the dawn in Medea, while  another of the same school believes, on equally good evidence, that both  Aeetes and Medea are the moon, so writers like Porphyry (270 A. D.)  and Plutarch (60 A. D.) made the ancient deities types of their own  favourite doctrines, whatever these might happen to be.    When Christianity became powerful, the Christian writers naturally  attacked heathen religion where it was most vulnerable, on the side of  the myths, and of the mysteries which were dramatic representations  of the myths. \"Pretty gods you worship,\" said the Fathers, in effect,  \"homicides, adulterers, bulls, bears, mice, ants, and what not.\" The  heathen apologists for the old religion were thus driven in the early  ages of Christianity to various methods of explaining away the myths of  their discredited religion.    The early Christian writers very easily, and with considerable  argumentative power, disposed of the apologies for the myths advanced by  Porphyry and Plutarch. Thus Eusebius in the Praeparatio Evangelica  first attacks the Egyptian interpretations of their own bestial or  semi-bestial gods. He shows that the various interpretations destroy  each other, and goes on to point out that Greek myth is in essence only  a veneered and varnished version of the faith of Egypt. He ridicules,  with a good deal of humour, the old theories which resolved so many  mythical heroes into the sun; he shows that while one system is  contented to regard Zeus as mere fire and air, another system recognises  in him the higher reason, while Heracles, Dionysus, Apollo, and  Asclepius, father and child, are all indifferently the sun.    Granting that the myth-makers were only constructing physical  allegories, why did they wrap them up, asks Eusebius, in what WE  consider abominable fictions? In what state were the people who could  not look at the pure processes of Nature without being reminded of  the most hideous and unnatural offences? Once more: \"The physical  interpreters do not even agree in their physical interpretations\". All  these are equally facile, equally plausible, and equally incapable of  proof. Again, Eusebius argues, the interpreters take for granted in the  makers of the myths an amount of physical knowledge which they certainly  did not possess. For example, if Leto were only another name for Hera,  the character of Zeus would be cleared as far as his amour with Leto is  concerned. Now, the ancient believers in the \"physical phenomena theory\"  of myths made out that Hera, the wife of Zeus, was really the same  person under another name as Leto, his mistress. \"For Hera is the earth\"  (they said at other times that Hera was the air), \"and Leto is the  night; but night is only the shadow of the earth, and therefore Leto  is only the shadow of Hera.\" It was easy, however, to prove that this  scientific view of night as the shadow of earth was not likely to be  known to myth-makers, who regarded \"swift Night\" as an actual person.  Plutarch, too, had an abstruse theory to explain the legend about the  dummy wife,--a log of oak-wood, which Zeus pretended to marry when at  variance with Hera.(1)      (1) Pausanias, ix. 31.      This quarrel, he said, was merely the confusion and strife of elements.  Zeus was heat, Hera was cold (she had already been explained as earth  and air), the dummy wife of oak-wood was a tree that emerged after a  flood, and so forth. Of course, there was no evidence that mythopoeic  men held Plutarchian theories of heat and cold and the conflict of  the elements; besides, as Eusebius pointed out, Hera had already been  defined once as an allegory of wedded life, and once as the earth, and  again as the air, and it was rather too late to assert that she was also  the cold and watery element in the world. As for his own explanation of  the myths, Eusebius holds that they descend from a period when men in  their lawless barbarism knew no better than to tell such tales. \"Ancient  folk, in the exceeding savagery of their lives, made no account of God,  the universal Creator (here Eusebius is probably wrong)... but betook  them to all manner of abominations. For the laws of decent existence  were not yet established, nor was any settled and peaceful state  ordained among men, but only a loose and savage fashion of wandering  life, while, as beasts irrational, they cared for no more than to fill  their bellies, being in a manner without God in the world.\" Growing  a little more civilised, men, according to Eusebius, sought after  something divine, which they found in the heavenly bodies. Later,  they fell to worshipping living persons, especially \"medicine men\" and  conjurors, and continued to worship them even after their decease,  so that Greek temples are really tombs of the dead.(1) Finally, the  civilised ancients, with a conservative reluctance to abandon their  old myths (Greek text omitted), invented for them moral or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,"dramatic. There was an old  haircloth sofa in especial, to which she had confided a hundred childish  sorrows. The place owed much of its mysterious melancholy to the fact  that it was properly entered from the second door of the house, the  door that had been condemned, and that it was secured by bolts which a  particularly slender little girl found it impossible to slide. She  knew that this silent, motionless portal opened into the street; if the  sidelights had not been filled with green paper she might have looked  out upon the little brown stoop and the well-worn brick pavement. But  she had no wish to look out, for this would have interfered with her  theory that there was a strange, unseen place on the other side--a place  which became to the child's imagination, according to its different  moods, a region of delight or of terror.    It was in the \"office\" still that Isabel was sitting on that melancholy  afternoon of early spring which I have just mentioned. At this time  she might have had the whole house to choose from, and the room she had  selected was the most depressed of its scenes. She had never opened the  bolted door nor removed the green paper (renewed by other hands) from  its sidelights; she had never assured herself that the vulgar street lay  beyond. A crude, cold rain fell heavily; the spring-time was indeed an  appeal--and it seemed a cynical, insincere appeal--to patience. Isabel,  however, gave as little heed as possible to cosmic treacheries; she kept  her eyes on her book and tried to fix her mind. It had lately occurred  to her that her mind was a good deal of a vagabond, and she had spent  much ingenuity in training it to a military step and teaching it  to advance, to halt, to retreat, to perform even more complicated  manoeuvres, at the word of command. Just now she had given it marching  orders and it had been trudging over the sandy plains of a history of  German Thought. Suddenly she became aware of a step very different from  her own intellectual pace; she listened a little and perceived that some  one was moving in the library, which communicated with the office. It  struck her first as the step of a person from whom she was looking for a  visit, then almost immediately announced itself as the tread of a  woman and a stranger--her possible visitor being neither. It had an  inquisitive, experimental quality which suggested that it would not stop  short of the threshold of the office; and in fact the doorway of this  apartment was presently occupied by a lady who paused there and looked  very hard at our heroine. She was a plain, elderly woman, dressed in  a comprehensive waterproof mantle; she had a face with a good deal of  rather violent point.    \"Oh,\" she began, \"is that where you usually sit?\" She looked about at  the heterogeneous chairs and tables.    \"Not when I have visitors,\" said Isabel, getting up to receive the  intruder.    She directed their course back to the library while the visitor  continued to look about her. \"You seem to have plenty of other rooms;  they're in rather better condition. But everything's immensely worn.\"    \"Have you come to look at the house?\" Isabel asked. \"The servant will  show it to you.\"    \"Send her away; I don't want to buy it. She has probably gone to  look for you and is wandering about upstairs; she didn't seem at all  intelligent. You had better tell her it's no matter.\" And then, since  the girl stood there hesitating and wondering, this unexpected critic  said to her abruptly: \"I suppose you're one of the daughters?\"    Isabel thought she had very strange manners. \"It depends upon whose  daughters you mean.\"    \"The late Mr. Archer's--and my poor sister's.\"    \"Ah,\" said Isabel slowly, \"you must be our crazy Aunt Lydia!\"    \"Is that what your father told you to call me? I'm your Aunt Lydia, but  I'm not at all crazy: I haven't a delusion! And which of the daughters  are you?\"    \"I'm the youngest of the three, and my name's Isabel.\"    \"Yes; the others are Lilian and Edith. And are you the prettiest?\"    \"I haven't the least idea,\" said the girl.    \"I think you must be.\" And in this way the aunt and the niece made  friends. The aunt had quarrelled years before with her brother-in-law,  after the death of her sister, taking him to task for the manner in  which he brought up his three girls. Being a high-tempered man he had  requested her to mind her own business, and she had taken him at his  word. For many years she held no communication with him and after his  death had addressed not a word to his daughters, who had been bred in  that disrespectful view of her which we have just seen Isabel betray.  Mrs. Touchett's behaviour was, as usual, perfectly deliberate. She  intended to go to America to look after her investments (with which her  husband, in spite of his great financial position, had nothing to  do) and would take advantage of this opportunity to enquire into the  condition of her nieces. There was no need of writing, for she should  attach no importance to any account of them she should elicit by letter;  she believed, always, in seeing for one's self. Isabel found, however,  that she knew a good deal about them, and knew about the marriage of the  two elder girls; knew that their poor father had left very little money,  but that the house in Albany, which had passed into his hands, was to  be sold for their benefit; knew, finally, that Edmund Ludlow,  Lilian's husband, had taken upon himself to attend to this matter, in  consideration of which the young couple, who had come to Albany during  Mr. Archer's illness, were remaining there for the present and, as well  as Isabel herself, occupying the old place.    \"How much money do you expect for it?\" Mrs. Touchett asked of her  companion, who had brought her to sit in the front parlour, which she  had inspected without enthusiasm.    \"I haven't the least idea,\" said the girl.    \"That's the second time you have said that to me,\" her aunt rejoined.  \"And yet you don't look at all stupid.\"    \"I'm not stupid; but I don't know anything about money.\"    \"Yes, that's the way you were brought up--as if you were to inherit a  million. What have you in point of fact inherited?\"    \"I really can't tell you. You must ask Edmund and Lilian; they'll be  back in half an hour.\"    \"In Florence we should call it a very bad house,\" said Mrs. Touchett;  \"but here, I dare say, it will bring a high price. It ought to make  a considerable sum for each of you. In addition to that you must have  something else; it's most extraordinary your not knowing. The position's  of value, and they'll probably pull it down and make a row of shops.  I wonder you don't do that yourself; you might let the shops to great  advantage.\"    Isabel stared; the idea of letting shops was new to her. \"I hope they  won't pull it down,\" she said; \"I'm extremely fond of it.\"    \"I don't see what makes you fond of it; your father died here.\"    \"Yes; but I don't dislike it for that,\" the girl rather strangely  returned. \"I like places in which things have happened--even if they're  sad things. A great many people have died here; the place has been full  of life.\"    \"Is that what you call being full of life?\"    \"I mean full of experience--of people's feelings and sorrows. And not of  their sorrows only, for I've been very happy here as a child.\"    \"You should go to Florence if you like houses in which things have  happened--especially deaths. I live in an old palace in which three  people have been murdered; three that were known and I don't know how  many more besides.\"    \"In an old palace?\" Isabel repeated.    \"Yes, my dear; a very different affair from this. This is very  bourgeois.\"    Isabel felt some emotion, for she had always thought highly of her  grandmother's house. But the emotion was of a kind which led her to say:  \"I should like very much to go to Florence.\"    \"Well, if you'll be very good, and do everything I tell you I'll take  you there,\" Mrs. Touchett declared.    Our young woman's emotion deepened; she flushed a little and smiled at  her aunt in silence. \"Do everything you tell me? I don't think I can  promise that.\"    \"No, you don't look like a person of that sort. You're fond of your own  way; but it's not for me to blame you.\"    \"And yet, to go to Florence,\" the girl exclaimed in a moment, \"I'd  promise almost anything!\"    Edmund and Lilian were slow to return, and Mrs. Touchett had an  hour's uninterrupted talk with her niece, who found her a strange and  interesting figure: a figure essentially--almost the first she had ever  met. She was as eccentric as Isabel had always supposed; and hitherto,  whenever the girl had heard people described as eccentric, she had  thought of them as offensive or alarming. The term had always suggested  to her something grotesque and even sinister. But her aunt made it a  matter of high but easy irony, or comedy, and led her to ask herself  if the common tone, which was all she had known, had ever been as  interesting. No one certainly had on any occasion so held her as this  little thin-lipped, bright-eyed, foreign-looking woman, who retrieved an  insignificant appearance by a distinguished manner and, sitting there in  a well-worn waterproof, talked with striking familiarity of the courts  of Europe. There was nothing flighty about Mrs. Touchett, but she  recognised no social superiors, and, judging the great ones of the earth  in a way that spoke of this, enjoyed the consciousness of making  an impression on a candid and susceptible mind. Isabel at first had  answered a good many questions, and it was from her answers apparently  that Mrs. Touchett derived a high opinion of her intelligence. But after  this she had asked a good many, and her aunt's answers, whatever turn  they took, struck her as food for deep reflexion. Mrs. Touchett waited  for the return of her other niece as long as she thought reasonable, but  as at six o'clock Mrs. Ludlow"]]]
