Then, too, as before, the Vampire, laughing aloud,  slipped through their fingers and returned to its dangling-place.    To fail twice was too much for Raja Vikram's temper, which was right  kingly and somewhat hot. This time he bade his son strike the Baital's  head with his sword. Then, more like a wounded bear of Himalaya than a  prince who had established an era, he hurried up the tree, and directed  a furious blow with his sabre at the Vampire's lean and calfless legs.  The violence of the stroke made its toes loose their hold of the bough,  and when it touched the ground, Dharma Dhwaj's blade fell heavily  upon its matted brown hair. But the blows appeared to have lighted on  iron-wood--to judge at least from the behaviour of the Baital, who no  sooner heard the question, \"O wretch, who art thou?\" than it returned in  loud glee and merriment to its old position.    Five mortal times did Raja Vikram repeat this profitless labour. But  so far from losing heart, he quite entered into the spirit of the  adventure. Indeed he would have continued climbing up that tree and  taking that corpse under his arm--he found his sword useless--and  bringing it down, and asking it who it was, and seeing it slip through  his fingers, six times sixty times, or till the end of the fourth and  present age,[45] had such extreme resolution been required.    However, it was not necessary. On the seventh time of falling, the  Baital, instead of eluding its capturer's grasp, allowed itself to be  seized, merely remarking that \"even the gods cannot resist a thoroughly  obstinate man.\"[46] And seeing that the stranger, for the better  protection of his prize, had stripped off his waistcloth and was making  it into a bag, the Vampire thought proper to seek the most favourable  conditions for himself, and asked his conqueror who he was, and what he  was about to do?    \"Vile wretch,\" replied the breathless hero, \"know me to be Vikram the  Great, Raja of Ujjayani, and I bear thee to a man who is amusing himself  by drumming to devils on a skull.\"    \"Remember the old saying, mighty Vikram!\" said the Baital, with a  sneer, \"that many a tongue has cut many a throat. I have yielded to thy  resolution and I am about to accompany thee, bound to thy back like a  beggar's wallet. But hearken to my words, ere we set out upon the way.  I am of a loquacious disposition, and it is well nigh an hour's walk  between this tree and the place where thy friend sits, favouring his  friends with the peculiar music which they love. Therefore, I shall  try to distract my thoughts, which otherwise might not be of the most  pleasing nature, by means of sprightly tales and profitable reflections.  Sages and men of sense spend their days in the delights of light and  heavy literature, whereas dolts and fools waste time in sleep and  idleness. And I purpose to ask thee a number of questions, concerning  which we will, if it seems fit to thee, make this covenant:    \"Whenever thou answerest me, either compelled by Fate or entrapped by my  cunning into so doing, or thereby gratifying thy vanity and conceit,  I leave thee and return to my favourite place and position in the  siras-tree, but when thou shalt remain silent, confused, and at a loss  to reply, either through humility or thereby confessing thine ignorance,  and impotence, and want of comprehension, then will I allow thee, of  mine own free will, to place me before thine employer. Perhaps I should  not say so; it may sound like bribing thee, but--take my counsel, and  mortify thy pride, and assumption, and arrogance, and haughtiness, as  soon as possible. So shalt thou derive from me a benefit which none but  myself can bestow.\"    Raja Vikram hearing these rough words, so strange to his royal ear,  winced; then he rejoiced that his heir apparent was not near; then  he looked round at his son Dharma Dhwaj, to see if he was impertinent  enough to be amused by the Baital. But the first glance showed him the  young prince busily employed in pinching and screwing the monster's  legs, so as to make it fit better into the cloth. Vikram then seized  the ends of the waistcloth, twisted them into a convenient form for  handling, stooped, raised the bundle with a jerk, tossed it over his  shoulder, and bidding his son not to lag behind, set off at a round pace  towards the western end of the cemetery.    The shower had ceased, and, as they gained ground, the weather greatly  improved.    The Vampire asked a few indifferent questions about the wind and  the rain and the mud. When he received no answer, he began to feel  uncomfortable, and he broke out with these words: \"O King Vikram, listen  to the true story which I am about to tell thee.\"          VIKRAM AND THE VAMPIRE          THE VAMPIRE'S FIRST STORY -- In which a man deceives a woman.    In Benares once reigned a mighty prince, by name Pratapamukut, to whose  eighth son Vajramukut happened the strangest adventure.    One morning, the young man, accompanied by the son of his father's  pradhan or prime minister, rode out hunting, and went far into the  jungle. At last the twain unexpectedly came upon a beautiful \"tank [47]\"  of a prodigious size. It was surrounded by short thick walls of fine  baked brick; and flights and ramps of cut-stone steps, half the length  of each face, and adorned with turrets, pendants, and finials, led down  to the water. The substantial plaster work and the masonry had fallen  into disrepair, and from the crevices sprang huge trees, under whose  thick shade the breeze blew freshly, and on whose balmy branches the  birds sang sweetly; the grey squirrels [48] chirruped joyously as they  coursed one another up the gnarled trunks, and from the pendent llianas  the longtailed monkeys were swinging sportively. The bountiful hand of  Sravana [49] had spread the earthen rampart with a carpet of the softest  grass and many-hued wild flowers, in which were buzzing swarms of bees  and myriads of bright winged insects; and flocks of water fowl, wild  geese, Brahmini ducks, bitterns, herons, and cranes, male and female,  were feeding on the narrow strip of brilliant green that belted the long  deep pool, amongst the broad-leaved lotuses with the lovely blossoms,  splashing through the pellucid waves, and basking happily in the genial  sun.    The prince and his friend wondered when they saw the beautiful tank in  the midst of a wild forest, and made many vain conjectures about it.  They dismounted, tethered their horses, and threw their weapons upon the  ground; then, having washed their hands and faces, they entered a shrine  dedicated to Mahadeva, and there began to worship the presiding deity.    Whilst they were making their offerings, a bevy of maidens, accompanied  by a crowd of female slaves, descended the opposite flight of steps.  They stood there for a time, talking and laughing and looking about them  to see if any alligators infested the waters. When convinced that the  tank was safe, they disrobed themselves in order to bathe. It was truly  a splendid spectacle.    \"Concerning which the less said the better,\" interrupted Raja Vikram in  an offended tone.[50]    --but did not last long. The Raja's daughter--for the principal maiden  was a princess--soon left her companions, who were scooping up water  with their palms and dashing it over one another's heads, and proceeded  to perform the rites of purification, meditation, and worship. Then she  began strolling with a friend under the shade of a small mango grove.    The prince also left his companion sitting in prayer, and walked forth  into the forest. Suddenly the eyes of the Raja's son and the Raja's  daughter met. She started back with a little scream. He was fascinated  by her beauty, and began to say to himself, \"O thou vile Karma,[51] why  worriest thou me?\"    Hearing this, the maiden smiled encouragement, but the poor youth,  between palpitation of the heart and hesitation about what to say, was  so confused that his tongue crave to his teeth. She raised her eyebrows  a little. There is nothing which women despise in a man more than  modesty, [52] for mo-des-ty--    A violent shaking of the bag which hung behind Vikram's royal back broke  off the end of this offensive sentence. And the warrior king did not  cease that discipline till the Baital promised him to preserve more  decorum in his observations.    Still the prince stood before her with downcast eyes and suffused  cheeks: even the spur of contempt failed to arouse his energies. Then  the maiden called to her friend, who was picking jasmine flowers so as  not to witness the scene, and angrily asked why that strange man was  allowed to stand and stare at her? The friend, in hot wrath, threatened  to call the slave, and throw Vajramukut into the pond unless he  instantly went away with his impudence. But as the prince was rooted to  the spot, and really had not heard a word of what had been said to him,  the two women were obliged to make the first move.    As they almost reached the tank, the beautiful maiden turned her head to  see what the poor modest youth was doing.    Vajramukut was formed in every way to catch a woman's eye. The Raja's  daughter therefore half forgave him his offence of mod----. Again she  sweetly smiled, disclosing two rows of little opals. Then descending  to the water's edge, she stooped down and plucked a lotus. This she  worshipped; next she placed it in her hair, then she put it in her ear,  then she bit it with her teeth, then she trod upon it with her foot,  then she raised it up again, and lastly she stuck it in her bosom. After  which she mounted her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24001"],[0,"The Physical Life of Woman: Advice to the Maiden, Wife and Mother (#9)"],[1,"pain, and its effects on the general health. She should  convince herself that all these do not vary from the standards of health  we have previously laid down. Or should they do so, she should not delay  to use the proper means to bring them to that standard.    Long observation proves that if, during the first two or three years  which follow the attainment of puberty, the health of the girl is  successfully guarded, and this, her most important physical distinction,  meets with no derangement, her life-long health is well-nigh secured;  but, on the contrary, if she commences her sexual life with pain and  disorder, she is likely to be a life-long sufferer.    We are about to approach a topic of vital importance, therefore, in  summing up as briefly as may be, the precautions necessary to attain  this end. They can most conveniently be divided into those to be  observed during the monthly changes, and those more general rules of  health to be obeyed in the intervals of the periods.      PRECAUTIONS DURING THE MONTHLY CHANGES.    At the head of all cautions and warnings which we could give about the  care of the health at these monthly periods, we put _rest_, _rest_,  bodily and mental. _Do less than usual_, we say to all, whether the  necessity for it is manifest or not. Over-exertion is a most fruitful  cause of disease. Long walks, shopping, dancing, riding, hard work  whether for pleasure or profit, should be avoided to the utmost.    The advantages of rest cannot be over-estimated. A striking example of  it occurs to our mind. Most readers are aware how toilsome are the lives  of the Indian women among our Western tribes, and also how singularly  easy and almost painless is their child-bearing. The pangs of travail  are almost unknown to them. The cause of this has puzzled even  physicians. We can tell them. It is because it is an inviolable, a  sacred rule among all those tribes, for the woman, when having her  monthly sickness, to drop all work, absent herself from the lodge, and  remain in perfect rest as long as the discharge continues.    Traces of this wide-spread custom among primitive people, extended  themselves, are discoverable among civilized lands. The famous general  council of the Christian Church held at Nice in the fourth century,  passed a rule disapproving of women coming to church at the times of  their menstrual sickness. The cold and dampness of large edifices, the  mental excitement and its unfavourable effects and the exertion  requisite for long walks to and fro, would justify this rule on purely  hygienic grounds, and such may have caused its adoption.    A moderate and uniform temperature favors health at such epochs; while  exposure to heat or cold, and the drinking freely of iced water or  stimulants should be shunned.    The popular belief that bathing is hurtful, is correct so far as either  cold or hot baths are concerned; but it is well to know, in the  interests of comfort and cleanliness, that a moderately warm-bath, about  80 deg. Fahr., _will do no injury_. Such a bath can be taken without any  hesitation.    We sanction, also, another well-known rule, and that is, that no  purgative medicine should be taken immediately before or during the  change. If called for by some other disorder, a mild laxative is all  that should be administered, unless by the direction of a physician.      PRECAUTIONS IN THE INTERVALS OF THE MONTHLY CHANGES.    If girls suffer from irregularities in this respect, the causes can  generally be found either in some affection threatening the general  health, such as scrofula, consumption, green sickness, etc., or else in  their mode of life. For the former, the family physician must be  consulted; but if it is the latter which is at fault, the remedy is in  the hands of the parents.    Boarding-school life, city life, mental troubles--these are the three  fertile sources of disturbances in the sexual functions of girlhood.    No one rates at higher value than ourselves the training of the mind;  but we do not hesitate a moment to urge that if perturbations of the  functions become at all marked in a girl at school, she should be _taken  away_. Better live at home in seeming idleness a year at that time of  life, than become a dead-weight, through constant ill health, on her  husband in after life.    So of the unwholesome excitement of a city life. There is a poison in  crowds, and it acts in a thousand unseen ways. With the ceaseless noise,  the broken sleep, the late hours, the impure air, and the nervous  tension which all these produce, it requires no strength of imagination  to perceive that the city is not the best place for the delicate girl.    We have mentioned _mental troubles_. Perhaps there are, among those who  read this, some superficial enough to smile at the possibility of  serious mental troubles in girlhood. There are, we know, many unfeeling  enough to give them no attention when they do see them. But we have an  unfailing witness in the sympathetic heart of the mother. She has not  forgotten how bitter were the crosses of her own younger years; she  knows that the sensitive soul of woman wakes early to the keenest  appreciation of grief as well as joy. If anything, years blunt us, and  the sorrows of youth are often the bitterest of our lives.    Let the mother, therefore, read with her wondrous maternal instinct the  trials of her daughter; let her become her most intimate confidant, and  pour upon the wounded spirit that balm which none but a woman, and that  woman a mother, knows how to apply. Such a relationship of mother and  daughter is no less natural and wholesome than it is beautiful.      WHEN THE CHANGES ARE DELAYED.    In health an equal interval, or one nearly equal, elapses between the  monthly illnesses. Often in the spring, however, their appearance  anticipates the expected date of their occurrence, and in the autumn  they are frequently a day or two late. These variations are owing to the  temperature, heat accelerating and cold retarding the process of  ovulation.    Such slight irregularities need not give rise to anxiety; but if there  is an unwonted delay, combined with other symptoms of ill-health, as  headache, pain in the side and back, a sense of languor and exhaustion,  loss of appetite, and nausea, and fitful sleep, then it is important  that some steps be taken to bring on the courses. For this purpose,  soaking the feet in hot-mustard water, a tumbler of hot ginger or  camomile-tea, a brisk walk, or a gentle laxative will generally be found  sufficient. Gently kneading the lower abdomen and loins is a familiar,  and if intelligently done, a safe means for the same purpose.    More violent means than these should be eschewed. Whichever are used  subsequent to their employment, rest, in a recumbent position, in a  warm room should be secured.      WHEN THE CHANGES ARE PAINFUL.    There are wide individual differences in this respect. Some young women  suffer much from local pains, headache and languor at such epochs,  without apparently losing anything in general health; others experience  no distress whatever.    The causes of painful periods are various. Sometimes they depend on a  tendency to rheumatism or to ague. Over-work, or excessive devotion to  social duties and pleasures, is often their source. Cold and damp are  common incidental causes. Green sickness and general debility are  sometimes to blame.    Of course the treatment must depend on which one of these is present. It  is a good rule, however, always to wear flannel next the skin; also, to  avoid exposure to the weather for several days before the change is  expected. A large, hot, linseed-meal poultice, over which a  dessert-spoonful of laudanum has been sprinkled, or a large  mustard-plaster, spread on the lower abdomen, will afford much relief. A  hot brick or bottle of hot water wrapped in flannel, and applied to the  small of the back, is often of great service. Rest in bed is always to  be recommended. A tea-spoonful of sweet spirits of nitre will sometimes  bring early relief.    But if these simple means are not sufficient, it would be better to  consult a physician.    A common belief is that such troubles are cured by marriage. Sometimes  they are, but we do not approve the remedy. The state of marriage  should be entered upon in perfect health and full vigor. Upon it  depends the health of future generations, and it were better for them  did only those assume its bonds who are able to endow their children  with sound physical frames.      THE AGE OF NUBILITY.    It does not follow, because a girl is capable of marriage, that she is  fit for it. Science teaches us many valid objections to too early  unions. It goes farther, and fixes a certain age at which it is wisest  for woman to marry. This age is between twenty and twenty-five years.    Anatomists have learned that after puberty the bones of a woman's body  undergo important modifications to fit her for child-bearing. This  requires time, and before twenty the process is not completed. Until the  woman is perfect herself, until her full stature and completed form are  attained, she is not properly qualified to assist in perpetuating the  species.    We might urge that up to this moment neither does her self-knowledge  qualify her to choose a life-companion, nor can her education be  finished, nor is her experience sufficient for her to enter on the  duties of a matron. But we do not appeal to these arguments. There are  others still more forcible. If her own health, life, and good looks are  of value to her, if she has any wish for healthy, sound minded children,  she will refrain from premature nuptials.    A too youthful wife finds marriage not a pleasure but a pain. Her  nervous system is prostrated by it; she is more liable to weakness and  diseases of the womb; and if of a consumptive family, she runs great  risk of finding that fatal malady manifest itself"]]]
