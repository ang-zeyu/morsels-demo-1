Their fires were visible: they were, for  several days, on the hills, not more than four miles from the British;  but they \"beat round and round, like a hare.\" A tribe, after a hot  pursuit, concealed their tracks, and suddenly vanished. They regularly  posted sentinels: passed over the most dangerous ground, and, on the  margin of fearful precipices: they would lie down beside a log--stone  dead, and could not be distinguished from the charred fragments of the  forest. Those who imagined that their eyes had never been averted, would  yet lose sight of the subtle enemy. They could not catch them, except by  stratagem; or, when they were caught, they could not hold them.[13] The  few captives that were obtained, when they thought proper, easily made  their escape. They confined them in a room: next morning, they had  passed through the flue into the open air, and freedom.    The extreme difficulty connected with their arrest by day, led to their  rapid destruction. The pursuers would watch, as the evening gathered in,  the thin smoke of the distant fires: they would cautiously advance, and  conceal themselves till midnight. The superstitious terror of the black,  prevented his wandering from the camp, lest the evil spirit that  haunted the darkness should carry him away. Thus, stretched around the  fire, the natives were easily seen, and musketry told with terrible  effect. Their dogs, instead of promoting their safety, sometimes led to  their sacrifice. A party, preparing to surround and capture them without  bloodshed, would move with quiet steps, without giving notice to the  aborigines; but just when all was prepared for the last movement, some  cur of ill omen would start up, and rouse them. They would seize their  spears and attempt to flee; and the whites, now disappointed of a  bloodless capture, would commence the slaughter.    In 1828, a tribe of natives threw stones at the constables, from a hill.  They returned a volley of shot; then charged with the bayonet: the whole  were slain. The excuse for the massacre was, that having no more  ammunition, the constables had no other means of defence, and that to  retreat was dangerous. An exploit, claimed by a corporal and party of  the 40th regiment, is disputed. They professed to have discovered a  tribe lodged on the shelf of a rock, inclosed by wall-like heights. They  poured in their fire, and dragged the women and children from their  shelter: all perished. This was stated to be a mere tale of pretended  success, and devised to satisfy the neighbourhood, that the men had done  their duty. It proves, at least, that such achievements were in request.  How fearful a condition for the government to tolerate, or for a colony  to approve.    In these expeditions, natives were often the guides, and were enabled to  follow up the track of their countrymen, when the English were  confounded. In those troublesome times, individuals of the tribes were  often left behind. It was the custom to fix small pieces of stick at  short distances, to assist the stragglers in rejoining their main body.  For a time, these signals being understood by the black guides, brought  them quickly on the route of the fugitives; but the guides soon betrayed  or exhausted this device, and though they continued to leave direction  sticks, they reversed their meaning, and distracted their pursuers.    The Tasmanian allies themselves, were exceedingly uncertain, and prone  to escape. They disclosed to their countrymen the plans adopted for  their capture, related the expeditions they had witnessed, and added new  excitements to rage. Sydney natives were obtained, to assist in the  capture: Pigeon and John Crook, under the care of Mr. Batman, promoted  the success of the undertaking. Pigeon narrowly escaped being shot: he  wandered from his party, and was seen by a stockman in a tree, who  fired, in spite of his endeavours to explain. Pigeon then slipped down,  and reached his friends, only in time to avoid the second charge of his  pertinacious antagonist. The story is worth relating, not on account of  the actors, but because it displays how cheap, at that hour, was the  life of a native, although peaceably living in the forests of his  country.    Among those distinguished for the knowledge of the bush, compassion for  the natives, and skill in pursuing them, Mr. Batman was the subject of  frequent and approving mention. It is said by Backhouse, that his  parties killed thirty, and captured five. Occasionally, natives were  found in the neighbourhood of Ben Lomond. In one instance, it is  recorded, that ten fell, and that two were taken; and in another, that  forty received the fire, and left behind them trails of blood, but no  captives. On another, fifteen or sixteen were said to fall, out of a  party of seventy: three hundred buck shot were poured into an  encampment, at twenty yards distance. It would be endless to recite  conflicts of this kind: they probably were but a multiplication of a  short bulletin, referring to an expedition--\"_five shot, and one  taken_.\" Looked at alone, even in the mildest form, these measures are  revolting; but to Mr. Batman belongs the praise of mingling humanity  with severity: of perceiving human affections in the creatures he was  commissioned to resist. His mission cannot be compared with that of his  successor, but he certainly began in the midst of conflict and  bloodshed, to try the softer influences of conciliation and charity. He  received a party into his house, endeavoured to win their regard; fed,  clothed, and soothed them; and when some of them disappointed his hopes,  by throwing off their garments and retiring into the bush, he still  persevered in attempting their reclamation.    But if the authorised system was attended with a sad sacrifice of native  life, no one will question the atrocities committed by _commandoes_,  first formed by stock-keepers, and some settlers, under the influence of  anger, and then continued from habit. The smoke of a fire was the signal  for a black hunt. The sportsmen having taken up their positions, perhaps  on a precipitous hill, would first discharge their guns, then rush  towards the fires, and sweep away the whole party. The wounded were  brained; the infant cast into the flames; the musket was driven into the  quivering flesh; and the social fire, around which the natives gathered  to slumber, became, before morning, their funeral pile.[14]    A detail of such facts, is in the hand of the writer, the recital of  which would disgrace, without improving mankind; and it is rather in  deference to a general principle than personal considerations, that the  crimes of amateur assassins are left to oblivion.[15]    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 12: \"Unless the blacks are exterminated, or removed,  conciliation is in vain. Shall the sons of a country give way before the  aborigines, _after having repulsed the arms of France_? They are now  shot, with as little remorse as so many crows!!\"--_Col. Advocate_,  1828.]    [Footnote 13: A party, under Major Grey, went out in pursuit: overtook a  few blacks; one was seized; but he was so smeared with grease, that he  slipped through the hands of his captors. A paper of the day recommends,  that the arms of the pursuer be thrust under the arms of the black; and,  the hands being raised, to be firmly clasped over the back of the  fugitive's neck--an expedient, that reminds us of the salt specific for  catching birds, with which most children have been delighted and  disappointed.]        SECTION V.    However just these representations of individual conduct, and with  whatever severity the measures of government bore upon the aborigines,  that unhappy people afforded ample reason for apprehension, and even  abhorrence. Their crimes were fearful, and the effect of their outrage  on the colonial mind can only be imagined. The fierce robbers, of  European origin, who had infested the land, were not half so terrible:  these were at least restrained by early associations and national  sympathies; often by conscience, and even by each other. But the natives  now united the antipathy of a national foe, and the rapacity of a  banditti, with the spite of individual revenge: they were at once a  people in arms, and a distributed band of assassins.    The correspondence between the local and imperial authorities exhibits  the feelings of the Governor, and his full consciousness, that however  necessary his proceedings might seem on the spot, surveyed from the  distance, they would wear the aspect of cruelty. In 1828, he apprised  Lord Goderich, that the proposal to remove the natives from the island,  had not met his concurrence; and that the commissioners for lands had  pointed out the north-east coast as adapted to their wants, well  sheltered and warm, abounding with game, accessible by water, and easy  to guard. It was stated by Colonel Arthur that harsh measures were  demanded by the colonists; but that he could not dismiss from his  recollection, that the whites were the aggressors, and that every plan  should be tried before treating the natives as accredited enemies. Three  months after, he forwarded another communication, which referred to the  murders recently committed, and justified the proclamation which he had  issued for their expulsion. So exasperated were the settlers, that the  safety of the blacks themselves seemed to demand this precaution. He  had, however, found it impossible to assign one district, owing to the  animosities of the tribes against each other, and therefore he resolved  to expel them to the remoter portions of their several territories. In  two other communications of the same year, the Governor reported the  temporary retirement of the natives, in search of marine subsistence,  and their return from their winter quarters in the November following,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#9)"],[1,"homogeneous system of philosophy, but a number of speculations, from  often varying standpoints, and they are frequently inconsistent. But  there are some ideas which are more or less present in all of them.  They regard Brahma as absolute and infinite Thought and Being at once,  and as such it is one with the consciousness, soul or self, of the  individual when the latter rids himself of the illusion of a manifold  universe and realises his unity with Brahma. Moreover, Brahma is  bliss--the joy of wholly perfect and self-satisfied thought and being.  Since Brahma as universal Soul is really identical with each  individual soul or _atma_, and vice versa, it follows that each  individual soul contains within itself, _qua_ Brahma, the whole of  existence, nature, gods, mankind, and all other beings; it creates  them all, and all depend upon it. Our Aupanishadas are thoroughgoing  idealists.    Another new idea also appears for the first time in the early  Upanishads, and one that henceforth will wield enormous influence in  all Indian thought. This is the theory of _karma_ and _samsara_,  rebirth of the soul in accordance with the nature of its previous  works. Before the Upanishads we find no evidence of this doctrine: the  nearest approach to it is in some passages of the Brahmanas which  speak of sinful men dying again in the next world as a punishment for  their guilt. But in the Upanishads the doctrine appears full-fledged,  and it is fraught with consequences of immense importance. Samsara  means literally a \"wandering to and fro,\" that is, the cycle of births  through which each soul must everlastingly pass from infinite time,  and Karma means the \"acts\" of each soul. Each work or act performed by  a living being is of a certain degree of righteousness or  unrighteousness, and it is requited by a future experience of  corresponding pleasure or pain. So every birth and ultimately every  experience of a soul is determined by the righteousness of its  previous acts; and there is no release for the soul from this endless  chain of causes and effects unless it can find some supernatural way  of deliverance. The Aupanishadas point to what they believe to be the  only way: it is the Brahma-knowledge of the enlightened sage, which  releases his soul from the chain of natural causation and raises him  to everlasting union with Brahma.    The teaching of the Upanishads has had two very different practical  results. On the one hand, it has moved many earnest thinkers to cast  off the ties of the world and to wander about as homeless beggars,  living on alms and meditating and discoursing upon the teachings of  the Upanishads, while they await the coming of death to release their  souls from the prison of the flesh and bring it to complete and  eternal union with Brahma. These wandering ascetics--_sannyasis_,  _bhikshus_, or _parivrajakas_ they are called--form a class by  themselves, which is destined to have an immense influence in  moulding the future thought of India. The teaching of Brahmanism is  beginning to recognise them, too. It has already divided the life of  the orthodox man into three stages, or _asramas_, studentship, the  condition of the married householder, and thirdly the life of the  hermit, or _vanaprastha_, to which the householder should retire after  he has left a son to maintain his household; and now it is beginning  to add to these as fourth stage the life of the homeless ascetic  awaiting death and release. But this arrangement is for the most part  a fiction, devised in order to keep the beggar-philosophers within the  scheme of Brahmanic life; in reality they themselves recognise no such  law.    The other current among the Aupanishadas is flowing in a very  different direction. We have seen how the worship of Rudra-Siva has  grown since the old Rigvedic days, and how some souls have been able  to see amidst the terrors of the god a power of love and wisdom that  satisfies their deepest hopes and longings, as none of the orthodox  rituals can do. A new feeling, the spirit of religious devotion,  _bhakti_ as it is called, is arising among them. To them--and they  number many Brahmans as well as men of other orders--Siva has thus  become the highest object of worship, Isvara or \"the Lord\"; and having  thus enthroned him as supreme in their hearts, they are endeavouring  to find for him a corresponding place in their intellects. To this end  they claim that Siva as Isvara is the highest of all forms of  existence; and this doctrine is growing and finding much favour. Among  the Aupanishadas there are many who reconcile it with the teaching of  the Upanishads by identifying Siva with Brahma. Thus a new light  begins to flicker here and there in the Upanishads as the conception  of Siva, a personal god wielding free grace, colours the pale  whiteness of the impersonal Brahma; and at last in the Svetasvatara,  which though rather late in date is not the least important of the  Upanishads, this theistic movement boldly proclaims itself: the  supreme Brahma, identified with Siva, is definitely contrasted with  the individual soul as divine to human, giver of grace to receiver of  grace. Later Upanishads will take up this strain, in honour of Siva  and other gods, and finally they will end as mere tracts of this or  that theistic church.    Yet another current is now beginning to stir men's minds, and it is  one that is also destined to a great future. It starts from Krishna.    The teaching of the Upanishads, that all being is the One Brahma and  that Brahma is the same as the individual soul, has busied many men,  not only Brahmans but also Kshatriyas, noblemen of the warrior order.  Some even say that it arose among the Kshatriyas; and at any rate it  is likely that they, being less obsessed with the forms of ritual than  the Brahmans and therefore able to think more directly and clearly,  have helped the Brahmans in their discussions to clear their minds of  ritual symbolism, and to realise more definitely the philosophic ideas  which hitherto they had seen only dimly typified in their ceremonies.    Krishna was one of these Kshatriyas. He belonged to the Satvata or  Vrishni tribe, living in or near the ancient city of Mathura.  Sometimes in early writings he is styled Krishna Devakiputra, Krishna  Devaki's son, because his mother's name was Devaki; sometimes again he  is called Krishna Vasudeva, or simply Vasudeva, which is a patronymic  said to be derived from the name of his father Vasudeva. In later  times we shall find a whole cycle of legend gathering round him, in  which doubtless there is a kernel of fact. Omitting the miraculous  elements in these tales, we may say that the outline of the  Krishna-legend is as follows: Krishna's father Vasudeva and his mother  Devaki were grievously wronged by Devaki's cousin Kamsa, who usurped  the royal power in Mathura and endeavoured to slay Krishna in his  infancy; but the child escaped, and on growing to manhood killed  Kamsa. But Kamsa had made alliance with Jarasandha king of Magadha,  who now threatened Krishna; so Krishna prudently retired from Mathura  and led a colony of his tribesmen to Dvaraka, on the western coast in  Kathiawar, where he founded a new State. There seems to be no valid  reason for doubting these statements. Sober history does not reject a  tale because it is embroidered with myth and fiction.    Now this man Krishna in the midst of his stirring life of war and  government found time and taste also for the things that are of the  spirit. He talked with men learned in the Upanishads about Brahma and  the soul and the worship of God; and apparently he set up a little  Established Church of his own, in which was combined something of the  idealism of the Upanishads with the worship of a supreme God of grace  and perhaps too a kind of religious discipline, about which we shall  say more later on. It must be confessed that we know sadly little  about his actual doctrine from first hand. All that we hear about it  is a short chapter in the Chhandogya Upanishad (iii. 17), where the  Brahman Ghora Angirasa gives a sermon to Krishna, in which he compares  the phases of human life to stages in the _diksha_ or ceremony of  consecration, and the moral virtues that should accompany them to the  _dakshina_ or honorarium paid to the officiating priests, and he  concludes by exhorting his hearer to realise that the Brahma is  imperishable, unfailing, and spiritual, and quoting two verses from  the Rig-veda speaking of the Sun as typifying the supreme bliss to  which the enlightened soul arises. This does not tell us very much,  and moreover we should remember that here our author, being an  Aupanishada, is more interested in what Ghora preached to Krishna than  in what Krishna accepted from Ghora's teaching. But we shall find  centuries later in the Bhagavad-gita, the greatest textbook of the  religion of Krishna, some distant echoes of this paragraph of the  Chhandogya.    The beginnings of the religion of Krishna are thus very uncertain. But  as we travel down the ages we find it growing and spreading. We see  Krishna himself regarded as a half-divine hero and teacher, and  worshipped under the name of _Bhagavan_, \"the Lord,\" in association  with other half-divine heroes. We see him becoming identified with old  gods, and finally rising to the rank of the Supreme Deity whose  worship he had himself taught in his lifetime, the Brahma of the  philosophers and the Most High God of the theists. As has happened  many a time, the teacher has become the God of his Church.          CHAPTER III    THE EPICS, AND LATER    I. VISHNU-KRISHNA      We now enter upon an age in which the old gods, Indra and Brahma,  retire to the background, while Vishnu and Siva stand in the forefront  of the stage.    The Hindus are of the same opinion as the Latin poet: _ferrea nunc  aetas agitur_. We are now living in an Iron Age, according to them;  and it"]]]
