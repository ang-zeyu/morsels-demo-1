[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Coarse adjustment.]    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Fine adjustment.]           For practical purposes the tube length = distance from the       end of the nosepiece to the eyeglass of the ocular. This is       the measurement referred to in speaking of \"long\" or \"short\"       tube.    ~3.~ The ~coarse adjustment~ (Fig. 40, c) should be a rack-and-pinion  movement, steadiness and smoothness of action being secured by means of  accurately fitting dovetailed bearings and perfect correspondence  between the teeth of the rack and the leaves of the pinion (Fig. 42).  Also provision should be made for taking up the \"slack\" (as by the  screws _AA_, Fig. 42).    ~4.~ The ~fine adjustment~ (Fig. 40, d) should on no account depend upon  the direct action of springs, but should be of the lever pattern,  preferably the Nelson (Fig. 43). In this form the unequal length of the  arms of the lever secures very delicate movement, and, moreover, only a  small portion of the weight of the body tube is transmitted to the  thread of the vertical screw actuating the movement.    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Spindle head to fine adjustment.]    A spindle milled head (Fig. 44) will be found a very useful device to  have fitted in place of the ordinary milled head controlling the fine  adjustment. In this contrivance the axis of the milled head is prolonged  upward in a short column, the diameter of which is one-sixth of that of  the head. The spindle can be rapidly rotated between the fingers for  medium power adjustments while the larger milled head can be slowly  moved when focussing high powers.    ~5.~ The ~stage~ (Fig. 40, e) should be square in shape and large in  area--at least 12 cm.--flat and rigid, in order to afford a safe support  for the Petri dish used for plate cultivations; and should be supplied  with spring clips (removable at will) to secure the 3 by 1 glass slides.    A mechanical stage must be classed as a necessity rather than a luxury  so far as the bacteriologist is concerned, as when working with high  powers, and especially when examining hanging-drop specimens, it is  almost impossible to execute sufficiently delicate movements with the  fingers. In selecting a mechanical stage, preference should be given to  one which forms an integral part of the instrument (Fig. 45) rather than  one which needs to be clamped on to an ordinary plain stage every time  it is required, and its traversing movements should be controlled by  stationary milled heads (Fig. 45, _AA'_). The shape of the aperture is a  not unimportant point; it should be square to allow of free movement  over the substage condenser. The mechanical stage should be tapped for  three (removable) screw studs to be used in place of the sliding bar, so  that if desired the Vernier finder (Fig. 45, _BB'_), such as is usually  fitted to this class of stage, or a Maltwood finder, may be employed.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Mechanical stage.]    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Iris diaphragm.]    ~6. Diaphragm.~--Separate single diaphragms must be avoided; a revolving  plate pierced with different sized apertures and secured below the stage  is preferable, but undoubtedly the best form is the \"iris\" diaphragm  (Fig. 46) which enters into the construction of the substage condenser.    ~7.~ The ~substage condenser~ is a necessary part of the optical outfit.  Its purpose is to collect the beam of parallel rays of light reflected by  the plane mirror, by virtue of a short focus system of lenses, into a  cone of large aperture (reducible at will by means of an iris diaphragm  mounted as a part of the condenser), which can be accurately focussed on  the plane of the object. This focussing must be performed anew for each  object, on account of the variation in the thickness of the slides.    The form in most general use is that known as the Abbe (Fig. 47) and  consists of a plano-convex lens mounted above a biconvex lens. This  combination is carried in a screw-centering holder known as the substage  below the stage of the microscope (Fig. 40 f), and must be accurately  adjusted so that its optical axis coincides with that of the objective.  Vertical movement of the entire substage apparatus effected by means of  a rack and pinion is a decided advantage, and some means should be  provided for temporarily removing the condenser from the optical axis of  the microscope.    [Illustration: FIG. 47--Optical part of Abbe illuminator.]    With the oil immersion objective, however, an ~achromatic condenser~,  giving an illuminating cone of about 0.9, should be used if the full  value of the lens is to be obtained. It is generally assumed that a good  objective requires an illuminating cone equivalent to two-thirds of its  numerical aperture. The best Abbe condenser transmits a cone of about  .45 whilst the aperture of the 1/12 inch immersion lenses of different  makers varies from 1.0 to 1.4, hence, the efficiency of these lenses is  much curtailed if the condenser is merely the Abbe. These improved  condensers must be absolutely centered to the objective and capable of  very accurate focussing otherwise much of their value is lost.    ~8. Mirrors.~--Below the substage condenser is attached a gymbal carrying  a reversible circular frame with a plane mirror on one side and a  concave mirror on the other (Fig. 40, g). The plane mirror is that  usually employed, but occasionally, as for example when using low powers  and with the condenser racked down and thrown out of the optical axis,  the concave mirror is used.    ~9. Oculars, or Eyepieces.~--Those known as the Huyghenian oculars (Fig.  48) will be sufficient for all ordinary work without resorting to the  more expensive \"compensation\" oculars. Two or three, magnifying the  \"real\" image (formed by the objective) four, six, or eight times  respectively, form a useful equipment.    As an accessory ~Ehrlich's Eyepiece~ is a very useful piece of apparatus  when the enumeration of cells or bacteria has to be carried out. This is  an ordinary eyepiece fitted with an adjustable square diaphragm operated  by a lever projecting from the side of the mount. Three notches are made  in one of the sides of the square and by moving the lever square  aperture can be reduced to three-quarters, one-half or one-quarter of  the original size.    ~10. Objectives.~--Three objectives are necessary: one for low-power  work--e. g., 1 inch, 2/3 inch, or 1/2 inch; one for high-power  work--e. g., 1/12 inch oil immersion lens; and an intermediate  \"medium-power\" lens--e. g., 1/6 inch or 1/8 inch (dry). These lenses  must be carefully selected, especial attention being paid to the  following points:    (a) _Correction of Spherical Aberration._--Spherical aberration gives  rise to an ill-defined image, due to the central and peripheral rays  focussing at different points.    (b) _Correction of Chromatic Aberration._--Chromatic aberration gives  rise to a coloured fringe around the edges of objects due to the fact  that the different-coloured rays of the spectrum possess varying  refrangibilities and that a simple lens acts toward them as a prism.    (c) _Flatness of Field._--The ideal visual field would be large and,  above all, _flat_; in other words, objects at the periphery of the field  would be as distinctly \"in focus\" as those in the centre. Unfortunately,  however, this is an optical impossibility and the field is always  spherical in shape. Some makers succeed in giving a larger central area  that is in focus at one time than others, and although this may  theoretically cause an infinitesimal sacrifice of other qualities, it  should always be sought for. Successive zones and the entire peripheral  ring should come into focus with the alteration of the fine adjustment.  This simultaneous sharpness of the entire circle is an indication of the  perfect centering of the whole of the lenses in the objective.    [Illustration: FIG. 48.--Huyghenian eyepiece.]    (d) _Good Definition._--Actual magnification is, within limits, of  course, of less value than clear definition and high resolving power,  for it is upon these properties we depend for our knowledge of the  detailed structure of the objects examined.    (e) _Numerical Aperture_ (_N. A._).--The numerical aperture may be  defined, in general terms, as the ratio of the _effective_ diameter of  the back lens of the objective to its equivalent focal length. The  determination of this point is a process requiring considerable  technical skill and mathematical ability, and is completely beyond the  powers of the average microscopist.[1]    Although with the increase in power it is correspondingly difficult to  combine all these corrections in one objective, they are brought to a  high pitch of excellence in the present-day \"achromatic\" objectives, and  so remove the necessity for the use of the higher priced and less  durable apochromatic lenses.    In selecting objectives the best \"test\" objects to employ are:    1. A thin (one cell layer), even    }     { 1\", 2/3\", 1/2\":  \"blood film,\" stained with Jenner's } for { 1/6\", 1/8\"  or Romanowsky's stain.              }     { 1/12\" oil    2. A thin cover-slip preparation    }  of a young cultivation of           }     { 1/8\" dry  _B. diphtheriae_ (showing           } for {  segmentation) stained with          }     { 1/12\" oil  methylene-blue.                     }    ~Accessories.~--_Eye Shade_ (Fig. 49).--This piece of apparatus consists  of a pear-shaped piece of blackened metal or ebonite, hinged to a collar  which rotates on the upper part of the body tube of the microscope. It  can be used to shut out the image of surrounding objects from the  unoccupied eye, and when carrying out prolonged observations will be  found of real service.    _Nosepiece._--Perhaps the most useful accessory is a nosepiece to carry  two of the objectives (Fig. 50), or, better still, all three (Fig. 51).  This nosepiece,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27748"],[0,"Popular Lectures on Zoonomia (#9)"],[1,"to the touch or the thermometer; in the same  manner, when it passes from a fluid state to that of vapour or gas,  it combines with a still larger quantity of heat, which remains  latent in it, so long as it continues in the state of gas, but when  it returns to the liquid or solid state, it gives out the heat which  was combined with it, which, being set at liberty, flows into the  surrounding bodies, and augments their temperature.    This is evinced by the conversion of ice into water, and of water  into steam; and by the return of steam into water. It is evinced  likewise by the evaporation of ether, and by numberless other  experiments.    Modern chemistry has shown that the atmosphere is not a homogeneous  fluid, but consists of two elastic fluids, endowed with opposite and  different properties.    If a combustible body, for instance a candle, be confined in a given  quantity of atmospheric air, it will burn only for a certain time;  after it is extinguished, if another combustible body be lighted and  immersed in the same air, it will not burn, but will immediately be  extinguished.    It has been proved by chemical experiments, that in this instance,  the combustible body absorbs that portion of the air which is fitted  for combustion, but produces no change on that which is unfit: so  that, according to this, the air of the atmosphere consists of two  elastic fluids, one of which is capable of supporting combustion, and  the other not; and that they exist in the proportion of one part of  the former to three of the latter nearly.    These two parts may be separated from each other, and experiments  made with them.    Many metals, and particularly manganese, when exposed to the  atmosphere, attract the combustible air from it, without touching the  other; and it may be procured from these metals by the application of  heat, in very great purity.    Because this air is essential to the formation of acids, it has been  called by chemists the acidifying principle, or oxygen gas.    On plunging a combustible body into the remaining air, it is  instantly extinguished; an animal in the same situation is  immediately deprived of life: from this latter circumstance this air  has been called azote, or azotic gas. If we take three parts of azote  and one of oxygen, and mix them together, we shall form an air in  every respect similar to that of the atmosphere.    If I plunge a piece of iron, previously heated, into oxygen gas, it  will burn with great brilliancy, the gas will be diminished in  quantity, and the iron augmented in weight, and this increase of  weight in the metal will be in proportion to the oxygen which has  disappeared: at the same time a great quantity of heat is given out.  This is the heat which was combined with the oxygen in the state of  gas, and which now becomes free, when the oxygen becomes solid and  joins with the iron.    The same phenomena take place when phosphorus is burned in oxygen  gas; the gas becomes diminished, the phosphorus increased, in weight,  and converted into an acid, and a great quantity of heat is given  out. The same is the case when charcoal is burned in this gas. In  short, in every instance of combustion, the oxygen combines with the  combustible body, and at the same time gives out its heat, which  supported it in the form of gas. This is the case of the combustion  of coal in a common fire, as well as in other cases of combustion;  the heat comes from the air, and not from the coal.    When we examine the phenomena of respiration with attention, we shall  find them very analogous to those of combustion. A candle will not  burn in an exhausted receiver: an animal in the same situation ceases  to live.    When a candle is confined in a given quantity of atmospheric air, it  will burn only for a certain length of time. On examining the air in  which it has been burned, the oxygen is found to be all extracted,  nothing remaining but azotic gas, and a quantity of carbonic acid  gas, produced by the union of the charcoal of the candle with the  oxygen of the atmospheric air.    In the same manner, if an animal be confined in a given quantity of  atmospheric air, it will live only a short time; on examining the air  in which it has ceased to live, it will be found to have lost its  oxygen: what remains being a mixture of azotic and carbonic acid  gases.    When a candle is enclosed in a given quantity of pure oxygen gas, it  will burn four times as long as in the same quantity of atmospheric  air.    In the same manner it has been proved, that an animal will be four  times as long in consuming a given quantity of pure oxygen gas, as in  rendering unfit for respiration the same quantity of atmospheric air.    Here then we observe a striking similarity between combustion and  animal respiration. The ancients seem to have had a more accurate  idea of respiration than most of the philosophers who followed them.  They supposed that the air contained a principle proper for the  support and nourishment of life, which they called pabulum vitae.  This idea, which was unconnected with any hypothesis, was followed by  systems destitute of foundation. Sometimes it was thought that the  air in the lungs incessantly acted as a stimulus or spur to drive on  the circulation; sometimes the lungs were considered in the light of  a pair of bellows, or fan, to cool the body, which was supposed to be  heated by a thousand imaginary causes: and when philosophers were  convinced, by experiments, that the bulk of the air was diminished by  respiration, they explained it by saying, that the air had lost its  spring.    Modern chemistry however enables us to explain the phenomena of  respiration in a satisfactory manner.    In order to see this, we shall proceed to examine the changes  produced by respiration; firstly, on the air, and secondly, on the  blood.    The air which has served for respiration, is found to contain a  mixture of azotic and carbonic acid gas, with a small quantity of  oxygen gas; and a considerable quantity of water is thrown off from  the lungs, in the form of vapour, during respiration.    From a variety of facts, it appears that oxygen gas is decomposed in  the lungs during respiration; a part of it unites, as we shall  afterwards see, with the iron contained in the blood, and converts it  into an oxid; another and greater portion unites with the carbon,  brought by the venous blood from all parts of the body to the lungs,  and thus forms carbonic acid gas; while another portion of the oxygen  unites with the hydrogen, brought in the same manner by the blood,  and forms water. Thus then we are able to account for the different  products of respiration.    Hence we see, that the explanation of animal heat follows as a simple  and beautiful corollary from the theory of combustion; and we may  consider respiration as an operation in which oxygen gas is  continually passing from the gaseous to the concrete state; it will  therefore give out at every instant the heat which it held in  combination, and this heat, being conveyed by the circulation of the  blood to all parts of the body, is a constant source of heat to the  animal.    These facts likewise enable us to explain the reason, why an animal  preserves the same temperature, notwithstanding the various changes  which occur in the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. In  winter the air is condensed by the cold, the lungs therefore receive  a greater quantity of oxygen in the same bulk, and the heat  extricated will be proportionally increased. In summer, on the  contrary, the air being rarefied by the heat, a less quantity of  oxygen will be received by the lungs during each inspiration, and  consequently the heat which is extricated must be less.    For the same reason, in northern latitudes, the heat extricated by  respiration will be much greater than in the southern. By this simple  and beautiful contrivance, nature has moderated the extremes of  climate, and enabled the human body to bear vicissitudes which would  otherwise destroy it.    Of all the phenomena of the animal body, there is none at first sight  more remarkable, than that which animals possess of resisting the  extremes of temperature.    The heat of the body, as has already been observed, continues at the  same degree, though the temperature of the atmosphere be sometimes  considerably hotter, at other times considerably colder, than the  animal body: so that man is able to live, and to preserve the  temperature of health, on the burning sands of Africa, and on the  frozen plains of Siberia.    The alterations of temperature which the human body has been known to  bear, without any fatal or even bad effects, are not less than 400  degrees or 500 degrees of Fahrenheit. The natural heat of the human  body is 96 degrees or 97 degrees. In the West Indies, the heat of the  atmosphere is often 98 degrees or 99 degrees, and sometimes rises  even to 126 degrees, or 30 degrees above the temperature of the human  body, notwithstanding which, a thermometer put in the mouth points to  96 degrees or 97 degrees. The inhabitants of the hot regions of  Surinam support, without inconvenience, the heat of their climate. We  are assured that in Senegal, about the latitude of 17 degrees, the  thermometer in the shade generally stands at 108 degrees, without any  fatal effects to men or animals. The Russians often live in places  heated by stoves to 108 degrees or 109 degrees, and some philosophers  in this country, by way of experiment, remained a considerable time  in a room heated above the boiling point of water.    On the other hand, an equal excess of cold seems to have no greater  effect in altering the degree of heat proper to animal bodies.  Delisle has observed a cold in Siberia 70 degrees below the zero of  Fahrenheit's scale, notwithstanding which animals lived. Gmelin has  seen the inhabitants of Jeniseisk under the 58th degree of"]]]
