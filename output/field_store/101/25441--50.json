A double in each stitch.    46, 47. With gray Angora wool, make a double in each stitch and fasten  off the last row neatly.    Cover a large, flat button-mold with the blue wool: Make a chain of 3  stitches, turn, and in 2d stitch of chain make 8 doubles; make 2 doubles  in each of 8 doubles, working in both veins of stitch; then make 1  double in 1st stitch, 2 in next, and repeat. Continue to work around and  around, widening to keep the work flat, until you have a circle which  will cover the button-mold, say 6 rounds; then work once around without  widening, slip in the mold, * miss 1, a double in next, and repeat until  the cover is closed.    For the edge of the button and the cord around top of band either the  double chain may be made, an ordinary chain filled with double crochet,  or--better still--the cord may be knotted by what is called the \"fool's  delight\" method--which seems a very sensible method, indeed: Take a  length of the Angora wool six times as long as the cord is wanted to be;  indeed, it will be better to start with a longer piece, for fear it may  \"take up\" more rapidly than anticipated. Make a slip or half knot at one  end of the yarn, pass the other end down through this to form a loop,  then tie the ends of the yarn together. Hold this knot between thumb and  forefinger of one hand (say the right), with the yarn which pulls  through the half knot under the same hand, and the loop which was formed  held on the forefinger, holding the yarn which does not pull in the left  hand; pass the forefinger of left hand through the loop on right  forefinger from front to back, catch up and draw through the non-pulling  or left-hand thread--exactly as you would make a chain-stitch in  crochet--transfer the knot which ties the two ends together to thumb and  forefinger of left hand, keeping the loop over forefinger, and draw up  the pulling yarn, or that passed originally through the half knot. Now  the position of the loop, pulling yarn and knot is exactly the same in  the left hand as formerly in the right. Continue by passing forefinger  of right hand through the loop on left forefinger, catching up the  non-pulling thread and drawing it through to form the new loop (on right  forefinger again), transfer the knot from left hand to right, and pull  up, repeating the process from beginning. This is really a sort of  double chain, and when one has learned to make it evenly and well--as  may be done with a little practise--it will be found superior for bags,  lingerie, and many other articles requiring a drawstring or a cord.    Sew this cord evenly around button and top of band, and the cap is  completed.          Ladies' Sleeveless Jacket or Hug-Me-Tight      [Illustration: Ladies' Sleeveless Jacket or Hug-Me-Tight]    Use Germantown worsted, white or any desired color, with a hook large  enough to carry the yarn smoothly. Commence with a chain of 140  stitches, turn.    1. Miss 3, 1 treble in each of 68 stitches following, shell of 3  trebles, 2 chain and 3 trebles in next stitch, to widen for center of  back, a treble in each remaining stitch, turn.    2. Chain 3 for 1st treble, a treble in each treble, including the 3  trebles of shell, up to the 2 chain, make a shell as before under 2  chain, then a treble in each following to the end, turn. Work always in  back vein of stitch to produce the ribbed or striped effect.    3 to 23. Same as 2d row. The jacket is now ready for joining.    Commencing at the point in center of back, count 26 stitches, then fold  over and, starting from the other end of the same row, crochet the two  sides together for 25 stitches, taking a stitch from each side. This  will leave about 65 stitches for armscye.    For the border:    1. Shell of 6 trebles in a stitch, miss 2, a treble in next, miss 2;  repeat. Commence with 3 chain for 1st treble of 1st shell, and join to  that.    2. Shell of 6 trebles between 3d and 4th trebles of shell in previous  row, and treble in treble; repeat.    3. Chain 4, fasten back in 1st stitch for a picot, a double between 2  trebles, repeat, making 5 picots around the shell, a double in single  treble; repeat.    Work around the armscye in same way.          Child's Coat Sweater      [Illustration: Child's Coat Sweater]    Use Germantown wool, cream-white or any color desired, and bone hook  size 4, or a hook large enough to carry the wool easily. The sweater is  crocheted in the length in two parts, and is joined in center of back.    Make a chain of 160 stitches, turn.    1. A double in each stitch of chain, chain 1, turn.    2. A double in each double, working in back vein of stitch to form a  rib.    3. Make star-stitches along the rib, thus: Chain 3, draw a loop through  2d and 3d stitches of chain, counting from hook, and a loop through each  of 2 doubles; take up wool and draw through the 5 stitches on needle,  chain 1 to close the star, draw a loop through eye of star just made  (under the 1 chain), another through the back part of last perpendicular  loop of the same star, and a loop through each of 2 doubles, close the  star by working off all the loops, chain 1, and repeat to end of row,  turn.    Make another rib of doubles by working across twice, then a row of  star-stitches, and continue until you have 4 rows of stars and 5 ribs;  on next row work 39 stars, then a rib, and continue until you have 3  rows of 39 star-stitches each. Work a row of doubles, break and fasten  the wool securely. Bear in mind that the star-stitches must be all  worked on the right side; the 1st row will come so, but the 2d will not  unless the wool is broken off at the end of 2d rib and fastened in at  other end again; then chain 3, and proceed with the row.    Beginning at the neck-end of the front strip, leave the 1st 6 stitches  (equal to 3 stars) and work to end of row in star-stitch; make a rib as  directed. Work 2 more rows of stars, with the ribs alternating, leaving  1 star less at the top or neck-end each time.    Work the other half to correspond, then join in center of the back with  single crochet, putting hook through a loop of each part. If carefully  done the joining will not be discernible. Join under arms, also, leaving  the opening for armholes.    For the border: Work 10 rows of double crochet, a double in each stitch,  around the entire garment, fronts, bottom and neck, widening at each of  the lower corners in each row to form the miter. Or, if preferred, work  around neck and down fronts first, completing the border; then work  around the bottom and across the front border. The widening for miter is  neater. The buttonholes are made in the 5th row of front; chain 5, miss  5, and repeat, making as many openings as desired, at equal distances.  In working back, next row, make also a double in each stitch of 5 chain.    For the sleeve: Chain 80 stitches, with 1 to turn, work a rib of doubles  on the chain, then 40 star-stitches. Repeat until there are 10 rows of  star-stitch and 11 ribs, taking care, as before, that the stars are  worked on the right side always. Join the sleeve-seam on the wrong side  with single crochet, as you did the back.    For the cuff: Work 12 rounds of double crochet, 1 double in each stitch  and turn back. Sew the sleeves into the armholes, and sew on buttons of  a size appropriate to the garment and corresponding with the  buttonholes.    This sweater may be very easily enlarged to any desired size by starting  with a longer chain and making more rows of star-stitch and ribs to keep  the proportion. The combination of stitches is a most attractive one.          Child's Jacket      [Illustration: Child's Jacket]    Materials required are three skeins of cream-white Saxony and one skein  of blue or pink, with a bone hook of suitable size to carry the yarn  smoothly.    Make a chain of 78 stitches.    1. On the chain make 8 stars, widen, (1 star, widen, 9 stars, widen)  twice, 1 star, widen, 8 stars. Break and fasten wool, and fasten in  again at beginning of row so as to have all stars made on the right  side. Or, one can work back with a row of doubles to beginning of 1st  row.    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Same as 1st row, except that you widen only every  other row, and always exactly in the center. Keep 8 stars on each front,  thus constantly increasing the upper portion of the sleeve, or gore  between 1st and 2d and 4th and 5th widenings.    9. Make 8 stars, chain 22 for armhole, fasten in 1st star on the back,  continue the stars across the back, chain 22, and make 8 stars across  front again.    10. Same as preceding row, making 11 stars on chain under each arm.    11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Same as 10th row, widening only  in center of back every other row, as at first. This completes the body  of the jacket.    21. Commencing the border, fasten in the colored wool at left front  corner of neck, and make 21 stars down the front. At the corner make 2  stars as if to widen, in order to turn the corner neatly, and continue  all the way around to top of right front, not widening at all in the  back of border, but making 2 stars to turn the corner as at first.    22. Stars all around, of color.    23. Fasten in the white wool at top of left front, chain 3, then make 2  trebles in the eye of each star all around, with 4 trebles in eye of  star at corners, so as to make the work lie smoothly.    24. With color, fasten in at top of left front, chain 3, and make 2  trebles between each 2 trebles of last row, with 4 at corners.    25. Same as 24th row, with white wool.    26. Across top of neck make spaces of trebles, separated by 2 chain, in  which to run cord or ribbon.    27. Also with white, make 2 trebles in every space.    28. With color, make 2 trebles between each group of last row.    29. Like 28th row, with white. This completes the collar.    30.

As the Spanish ladies are under a greater seclusion from general  society, than the sex is in other European countries, their desires of  an adequate degree of liberty are consequently more strong and urgent. A  free and open communication being denied them, they make it their  business to secure themselves a secret and hidden one. Hence it is that  Spain is the country of intrigue.    The Spanish women are little or nothing indebted to education. But  nature has liberally supplied them with a fund of wit and sprightliness,  which is certainly no small inducement to those, who have only transient  glimpses of their charms, to wish very earnestly for a removal of those  impediments, that obstruct their more frequent presence. This not being  attainable in a lawful way of customary intercourse, the natural  propensity of men to overcome difficulties of this kind, incites them to  leave no expedient untried to gain admittance to what perhaps was at  first only the object of their admiration, but which, by their being  refused an innocent gratification of that passion, becomes at last the  subject of a more serious one. Thus in Spain, as in all countries where  the sex is kept much out of sight, the thoughts of men are continually  employed in devising methods to break into their concealments.    There is in the Spaniards a native dignity; which, though the source of  many inconveniences, has nevertheless this salutary effect, that it sets  them above almost every species of meanness and infidelity. This quality  is not peculiar to the men; it diffuses itself, in a great measure,  among the women also. Its effects are visible both in their constancy in  love and friendship, in which respects they are the very reverse of the  French women. Their affections are not to be gained by a bit of  sparkling lace, or a tawdry set of liveries. Their deportment is rather  grave and reserved; and, on the whole, they have much more of the prude  than the coquette in their composition. Being more confined at home, and  less engaged in business and pleasure, they take more care of their  children than the French, and have a becoming tenderness in their  disposition to all animals, except a _heretic_ and a _rival_.    Something more than a century ago, the Marquis D'Astrogas having  prevailed on a young woman of great beauty to become his mistress, the  Marchioness hearing of it, went to her lodging with some assassins,  killed her, tore out her heart, carried it home, made a _ragout_ of it,  and presented the dish to the Marquis. \"It it exceedingly good,\" said  he. \"No wonder,\" answered she, \"since it was made of the _heart_ of that  creature you so much doated on.\" And, to confirm what she had said, she  immediately drew out her head all bloody from beneath her hoop, and  rolled it on the floor, her eyes sparkling all the time with a mixture  of pleasure and infernal fury.    A lady to whom a gentleman pays his addresses, is sole mistress of his  time and money; and, should he refuse her any request, whether  reasonable or capricious, it would reflect eternal dishonor upon him  among the men, and make him the detestation of all the women.    But, in no situation does their character appear so whimsical, or their  power so conspicuous, as when they are pregnant. In this case, whatever  they long for, whatever they ask, or whatever they have an inclination  to do, they must be indulged in.      ENGLISH WOMEN.    The women of England are eminent for many good qualities both of the  head and of the heart. There we meet with that inexpressible softness  and delicacy of manners, which, cultivated by education, appears as much  superior to what it does without it, as the polished diamond appears  superior to that which is rough from the mine. In some parts of the  world, women have attained to so little knowledge and so little  consequence, that we consider their virtues as merely of the negative  kind. In England they consist not only in abstinence from evil, but in  doing good.    There we see the sex every day exerting themselves in acts of  benevolence and charity, in relieving the distresses of the body, and  binding up the wounds of the mind; in reconciling the differences of  friends, and preventing the strife of enemies; and, to sum up all, in  that care and attention to their offspring, which is so necessary and  essential a part of their duty.    A woman may succeed to the throne of England with the same power and  privileges as a king; and the business of the state is transacted in her  name, while her husband is only a subject. The king's wife is considered  as a subject; but is exempted from the law which forbids any married  woman to possess property in her own right during the lifetime of her  husband; she may sue any person at law without joining her husband in  the suit; may buy and sell lands without his interference; and she may  dispose of her property by will, as if she were a single woman. She  cannot be fined by any court of law; but is liable to be tried and  punished for crimes by peers of the realm. The queen dowager enjoys  nearly the same privileges that she did before she became a widow; and  if she marries a subject still continues to retain her rank and title;  but such marriages cannot take place without permission from the  reigning sovereign. A woman who is noble in her own right, retains her  title when she marries a man of inferior rank; but if ennobled by her  husband, she loses the title by marrying a commoner. A peeress can only  be tried by a jury of peers.    In old times, a woman who was convicted of being a common mischief-maker  and scold, was sentenced to the punishment of the ducking-stool; which  consisted of a sort of chair fastened to a pole, in which she was seated  and repeatedly let down into the water, amid the shouts of the rabble.  At Newcastle-upon-Tyne, a woman convicted of the same offence was led  about the streets by the hangman, with an instrument of iron bars fitted  on her head, like a helmet. A piece of sharp iron entered the mouth, and  severely pricked the tongue whenever the culprit attempted to move it.    A great deal of vice prevails in England, among the very fashionable,  and the very low classes. Misconduct and divorces are not unfrequent  among the former, because their mode of life corrupts their principles,  and they deem themselves above the jurisdiction of popular opinion; the  latter feel as if they were beneath the influence of public censure, and  find it very difficult to be virtuous, on account of extreme poverty,  and the consequent obstructions in the way of marriage. But the general  character of English women is modest, reserved, sincere, and dignified.  They have strong passions and affections, which often develope  themselves in the most beautiful forms of domestic life. They are in  general remarkable for a healthy appearance, and an exquisite bloom of  complexion. Perhaps the world does not present a lovelier or more  graceful picture than the English home of a virtuous family.      RUSSIAN WOMEN.    It is only a few years since the Russians emerged from a state of  barbarity.    A late empress of Russia, as a punishment for some female frailties,  ordered a most beautiful young lady of family to be publicly chastised,  in a manner which was hardly less indelicate than severe.    It is said that the Russian ladies were formerly as submissive to their  husbands in their families, as the latter are to their superiors in the  field; and that they thought themselves ill treated, if they were not  often reminded of their duty by the discipline of a _whip_, manufactured  by themselves, which they presented to their husbands on the day of  their marriage. The latest travellers, however, assert, that they find  no remaining traces of this custom at present.    Russian fathers, of all classes, generally arrange marriages for their  children, without consulting their inclinations. Among the peasantry, if  the girl has the name of being a good housewife, her parents will not  fail to have applications for her, whatever may be her age or personal  endowments. As soon as a young man is old enough to be married, his  parents seek a wife for him, and all is settled before the young couple  know any thing of the matter.    Their nuptial ceremonies are peculiar to themselves; and formerly  consisted of many whimsical rites, some of which are now disused. On her  wedding day, the bride is crowned with a garland of wormwood; and, after  the priest has tied the nuptial knot, his clerk or sexton throws a  handful of hops upon the head of the bride, wishing that she might prove  as fruitful as that plant. She is then led home, with abundance of  coarse ceremonies, which are now wearing off even among the lowest  ranks; and the barbarous treatment of wives by their husbands is either  guarded against by the laws of the country, or by particular  stipulations in the marriage contract.    In the conversation and actions of the Russian ladies, there is hardly  any thing of that softness and delicacy which distinguishes the sex in  other parts of Europe. Even their exercises and diversions have more of  the masculine than the feminine. The present empress, with the ladies of  her court, sometimes divert themselves by shooting at a mark.  Drunkenness, the vice of almost every cold climate, they are so little  ashamed of, that not many years ago, when a lady got drunk at the house  of a friend, it was customary for her to return next day, and thank him  for the pleasure he had done her.    Females, however, in Russia, possess several advantages. They share the  rank and splendor of the families from which they are sprung, and are  even allowed the supreme authority. This a few years ago, was enjoyed by  an empress,"]]]
