Is he bound for the Hall?\"    \"Y--yes--sir.\"    \"Indeed? Then perhaps I'll see all of you later,\" muttered Asa Lemm;  and after that did what he could with the aid of some water and a  napkin to remove the traces of the accident from his person. In this he  was aided by the head waiter, who was profuse in his apologies over  what had occurred.    \"I'm afraid you've got yourself into a pickle, Andy,\" whispered his  twin, when the latter had taken his seat at the table.    \"I don't care. I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. Besides  that, I think the waiter was as much to blame as I was.\"    \"You'll never make old Lemon believe that,\" returned Spouter.    \"Spouter's right about that,\" puffed out Fatty. \"Once Asa Lemm gets  down on a boy--good night!\"    \"I wonder who the man with him is?\" questioned Spouter.    \"Maybe it's a new teacher,\" vouchsafed Jack.    \"I don't think so,\" returned Randy. \"I heard both of them talking about  some lawsuit and about money matters. Maybe the other fellow is a  lawyer.\"    \"I guess you're right,\" said Spouter. \"As I told you before, old Lemon  used to be worth a lot of money. Since he lost it he has been having  one lawsuit after another trying to get some of it back. Most likely  the other fellow is his lawyer.\" And in this surmise Spouter was  correct.    The accident had sobered all the boys, consequently the lunch was not  near so lively as it might otherwise have been. Still the irrepressible  Randy could not hold back altogether, and he got what little sport he  could out of it by putting some red pepper on Fatty's last mouthful of  pie. He used a liberal dose, and the pie had scarcely disappeared  within the stout youth's mouth when the boy began to splutter.    \"Ug--ug--ugh!\" came from Fatty as he made a wry face. \"What pie! That  last mouthful was like fire--full of pepper!\"    \"I thought the pie was rather hot,\" answered Randy, coolly.    \"Hot! It's nothing but pep all the way through!\" roared the fat boy.  \"Wow! let me have some water!\" and he gulped this down so hastily that  he almost strangled, the tears running down his cheeks. The other boys  set up a laugh.    The boys had had some celery served with their lunch and several stalks  which were not particularly good still remained in the dish on the  table. When the boys were ready to leave, Professor Asa Lemm and his  companion were still at their table discussing the particulars of a  coming lawsuit.    \"I'll give 'em something to remember us by anyhow,\" whispered Andy to  the chums when the party had arisen to leave the dining car; and before  any of the others could stop him he took up the stalks of celery and on  passing Asa Lemm dropped them in the professor's side pocket, leaving  the tops dangling outside.    \"Gee! but you're some funny boy,\" chuckled Fatty, gazing at Andy in  admiration. \"I wish I could think of things like that to do.\"    \"You'll think of 'em some day--when you get thin,\" returned Andy,  encouragingly. \"You see, I wanted to give him a bouquet to remember me  by;\" and at this remark there was a general snicker. Two or three of  the passengers in the car had noticed Andy's action and all were  smiling broadly over the incident.    \"If he ever finds out who did that, he'll be down on you worse than  ever,\" declared Jack, when the boys were once more in the chair car.    \"Oh, well, what's the difference?\" returned the light-hearted Andy.  \"I'd just as lief be shot for a mule as for a hoptoad.\"    \"I suppose he's going on to the Hall,\" remarked Spouter. \"If he is, I  hope he doesn't get into the auto-stage with us.\"    \"If he gets in the auto-stage, we might hire a jitney,\" suggested  Fatty. \"There are six of us, and we could get one of the jitneys to  take us over to the Hall, baggage and all, for half a dollar.\"    A little later the train made a stop of several minutes at quite a  large city. The boys were tired of sitting still and were glad enough  to go out on the platform to stretch their legs. Here they saw  Professor Lemm and his friend leave the train and walk up the main  street of the place.    \"Hurrah! we won't be bothered with him any more on this trip,\" declared  Spouter.    \"Look!\" cried Randy, suddenly, pointing to the two men; and as the boys  gazed in that direction they were just in time to see Asa Lemm pull the  stalks of celery from his pocket and throw them in the street. His  whole manner showed that he was much disgusted.    \"And to think he has thrown away your beautiful bouquet, Andy,\"  lamented Fred.    \"Never mind, Fred; we have to get used to keen disappointments in this  life,\" groaned Andy.    \"Won't he be coming back?\" questioned Fatty.    \"I don't think so--he won't have time,\" answered Jack; \"here comes the  conductor now.\"    \"All aboard!\" shouted the conductor at that moment, and the boys had to  hurry in order not to be left behind. Then the train pulled out of the  station and the journey was continued.    \"We certainly ought to have some dandy times,\" said Jack to Spouter, as  the train sped along. \"I suppose your father has told you of all the  good times our folks had when they went to Putnam Hall and Brill  College.\"    \"Yes, Jack. That is, he has told me about a good many things. Of course  I don't suppose he told me about some of the tricks they played.\"    \"Well, I've heard from father and from my Uncle Sam that my Uncle Tom  was playing tricks almost continually.\"    \"Then Andy and Randy come by their fun-making naturally.\"    \"They sure do! And what do you suppose the folks at home expect me to  do?\" went on Jack, seriously. \"They expect me to hold those twins in.  Why! a fellow could no more do that than hold in a pair of wild horses.  You've seen a little of what Andy can do. Well, his jokes aren't a  patch to those Randy occasionally gets off.\"    \"You don't say! Well, I'm not sorry. The last term at Colby Hall was  rather slow. Now maybe we'll have some life;\" and Spouter's face  lightened.    While the boys had been at lunch the sky had darkened, and now the  train rushed into a sudden heavy shower, the rain driving against the  windows of the car in sheets.    \"I don't like this much,\" said Fred, dolefully. \"Maybe we'll get out at  Haven Point in a regular downpour.\"    \"Oh, this looks more like a local shower than anything else,\" answered  Jack. \"We may run out of it in a few minutes.\"    \"Some rain, all right,\" remarked Randy, as the water continued to dash  against the windows.    \"Just look there!\" cried Andy, pointing out. \"Before it began to rain I  noticed the automobiles on yonder road kicking up quite a dust. Now  just look at the water and mud.\"    \"We'll be at Haven Point in twenty minutes--that is, if the train is on  time,\" announced Spouter, consulting his watch. \"Too bad! Because I  wanted you to see the beautiful scenery with which the school is  surrounded. Oh! the woods are perfectly beautiful, and after a heavy  rain the torrent of water coming down the river makes the outlook one  of marvelous beauty. I have stood there contemplating the scene----\"    \"Turn it off, Spouter! turn it off!\" broke in Fatty. \"You promised me  on your bare knees that you would stop spouting about nature this  term--and here you start in the first thing!\"    \"Oh, you haven't any more eye for beauty than a cow,\" retorted Spouter,  ruefully.    \"Why abuse the cow?\" questioned Andy, gaily. \"A cow has an eye for  beauty. Just you hold out a beautiful red apple to her and see if she  hasn't;\" and at this the others grinned.    Haven Point was still five miles away when the boys saw that the rain  was letting up; but the ditches along the track, and the highways  wherever they passed them, were filled with running water, showing that  the downpour in that vicinity had been a severe one.    \"Next station Haven Point!\" called out one of the trainmen as he came  through the car.    \"Better get your bags ready,\" cried Spouter. \"There may be other  fellows going to the Hall, and we want to get good seats on the  auto-stage if we can.\"    \"All right. You lead on, Spouter,\" answered Jack; \"we'll follow you.\"    In a few minutes more Haven Point was reached and the long train rolled  into the little station. One after another the boys alighted, the  porter helping them with their suitcases and gladly accepting the tips  they offered.    Spouter headed for a large auto-stage drawn up on the opposite side of  an open plot behind the station. As the Rovers and their friends  started for the turnout belonging to Colby Hall, they noticed that  several other boys had also left another coach of the train and were  headed in the same direction.    \"New fellows, like ourselves, I suppose,\" remarked Fred. \"Let's get  ahead of 'em.\"    \"That's the talk!\" exclaimed Randy. \"Come on!\" and he set off on a run  beside Spouter with the others at their heels.    The rain had been falling heavily at Haven Point just previous to the  arrival of the train, and consequently the open place behind the depot  contained numerous hollows of water and mud, around which the boys had  to make their way as best they could. They were rushing along as fast  as their handbaggage would permit, when they came up side by side with  three other lads also bound for the stage.    \"Look out there!\" cried Jack as one of the strangers leaped into a  puddle of water, splashing the mud right and left.    \"Look out yourself!\" cried the other youth, a big lad, much larger than  any of the others.    \"That's Slugger Brown--the bully I was telling you about,\" explained  Spouter as he continued to run.    Directly behind Slugger Brown came another youth, loudly dressed in a  checkered suit and a soft "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#9)"],[1,"thee dead,\" he cried, \"and surely would I  then have died too! Right sorely did I beat thee, master, there among  the devil flowers, to keep thee from the sleep that kills; but there  was no one to beat me, and I had but strength and sense to tie myself  too upon my horse before I too slept. And surely my sjambok must have  helped them against the poison flowers, for they came right through,  having smelt the water maybe; and brought us here to its very side,  where I awoke to find them drinking. But the other is there in the  dunes he will sleep well, that one; and die.\"    And die he did; for the next day, refreshed and fearing the flowers  little in the day time, we went back to the dune where we had left our  packs. It was barely a mile, and about half way we found the third  horse, dead.    The pan was but a small one, and the delicious water of the night  proved to be but a few gallons of stagnant liquid full of animalculae;  but there was grass for the horses, and to our joy we found that the  flower belt did not extend beyond where we had emerged from it. Bare  dunes spread again beyond, but even these were welcome, after our  experience of the \"devil flowers,\" as Inyati called them. Buck was  plentiful, and for a day or two we ate, drank, and slept to our heart's  content, gathering all the strength we could for our next attempt.  Inyati was full of confidence for the future, confident that we should  never have difficulties to encounter equal to those we had surmounted,  and that the diamonds and wives would soon be at our disposal.    \"North, master! almost due north now and we shall find pans on the way  with water! My magic stone has told me that and it makes no mistakes!  And to-morrow we start again; for the water will last but a few days  moreover, we have been long on the path.\"    Poor Inyati! the bravest, cheeriest comrade black or white that I have  ever had; little did I dream when he spoke thus that he would never  live to see the morrow!    That evening, as we sat smoking by the fire, we noticed that the two  horses were extremely nervous, pricking their ears and snorting as they  cropped the dry grasses a few yards away from us.    \"Leopards,\" suggested Inyati, \"there are many spoors here, but no  lions.\"    But scarcely had he spoken when the booming roar of a lion came from  the direction of the pool; to be immediately answered by another, and  another; until it was evident that the pan had been invaded by a  numerous troop of them. We both started to our feet with the same  thought in our minds. If they were hungry they might probably attack  the horses! It was still light, but no time was to be lost; so hastily  cutting down a number of the stunted thorn bushes with which the pan  abounded, we proceeded to build a \"scherm\" in which to pass the night.    We enclosed a space about fifteen yards square, and into this we  brought the horses, together with enough wood to keep a fire burning  all night; and as the hedge was seven or eight feet in height, and of  impenetrable thorn, we felt but little anxiety as to the presence of  the lions. As night fell, however, their roars became louder and  nearer, and by mid-night there were at least a dozen of them pacing  round our scherm, and barely kept at a distance by the frequent fire-  brands we threw over the fragile protection. Occasionally the huge  beasts fought amongst themselves, and the snarling, growling  pandemonium would become more deafening; then this diversion would  cease, and the whole troop would continue their pacing round our fence,  sniffing and snorting at us through the thorn bushes and making us feel  as one can imagine a mouse feels when caught in a trap, and with a  hungry cat peering through the bars at him. Time after time we scared  them away by throwing fire-brands among them, but always they returned,  and to our dismay, long before morning we realized that our stock of  firewood would not nearly last till daylight.    We had refrained from shooting, as it was impossible to see the brutes  through our scherm; but as the fire got lower, and they became more  daring, we sent a few shots among them, and the hellish hubbub that  ensued showed that some of them were hit. But this proved disastrous,  for a wounded animal, in its death struggles near the fence, came in  contact with the bushes and almost tore down our only protection before  a few more bullets finished it. There came a lull for a short time  after this, and we were congratulating ourselves that morning would  soon be dawning, when the lions would slink away, or when the light  would enable us to finish them when without the least warning a huge  form leapt clean over the hedge and landed in the centre of the scherm,  scattering the few remaining embers in all directions.    A second spring, and before either of us could shoot, the lion had  pounced upon Inyati, and had him down upon the ground beneath him,  shaking the poor fellow like a terrier shakes a rat. Mad with rage I  sent bullet after bullet into the brute's head and body till the click  of the hammer of my Winchester showed the magazine was empty, and the  lion rolled over dead, with Inyati still in its mighty grip, and to all  appearance dead also.    Then I must have gone berserk mad. I remember cramming the magazine  full again, and throwing aside the bush that blocked the entrance, I  stepped out among the lions.    I can never understand why I was not killed instantly; but not a lion  reached me, and at close range I fired shot after shot in the bright  moonlight, and lion after lion fell, till but two were left; and as  morning dawned these slunk away, leaving me alone with my dead.    Then I came back to the scherm, my mad fit of rage over, and nothing  but grief, and a sorrow too deep for words to express, left in my  heart. The huge lion lay right across the poor boy's body, still  gripping his crushed shoulder in its mighty jaws; but now I saw that in  spite of his terrible injuries Inyati was not dead, though he was dying  even as I came back to him. Strong as I was, no strength of mine could  have freed him from the grip of those terrible jaws, and as I struggled  to do so, his beseeching glance stopped me. I knelt down beside him.    \"Finished, master! finished,\" he whispered, \"yet we have made a good  fight and you, master, will win. Straight north now! Bury the little  gun with me, master. It may serve me who knows? And take thou the blue  stone, and this my armlet, it may help . . . master, master,  I go. . . .\"    And with his eyes fixed upon me, he died; that brave heart, that had  served me so well.    I was stupefied with the blow that had fallen upon me, and lay for an  hour or more as one stunned.    Once or twice the craven thought came upon me to use a bullet to end it  all, and once I actually lifted my revolver to my head; but dead  Inyati's last whisper seemed again to sound in my ear had I made a  \"good fight,\" to end it like a coward?    And so I lay in the shade of a tree, and sleep, the blessed healer,  came to me and saved my reason. For when I awoke, although my heart was  heavy, my brain was clear, and I knew what lay before me, and no longer  shirked the task.    The lion's head I hewed from its body, for I could not tear its huge  jaws asunder to release Inyati, and there I buried victim and victor  together.    And so, I was alone, in the heart of the desert, with return an  impossibility.    I struck north, as Inyati had told me, due north; in spite of the fact  that in that direction the dunes were of the worst; and for a day, and  half a night, I wayfared, striving in sheer physical suffering to drown  the sorrow of losing Inyati. God knows what I went through, or the poor  horses that I drove ruthlessly forward; moreover, the fever that was  already burning in my veins may have rendered me delirious? Certain it  is that this part, and many a day afterwards, is but a confused dream  to me. A dream of suffering, of incessant wandering from pan to pan;  here a few mouthfuls of stagnant water, and there a few t'samma still  keeping myself and the horses alive. For days the wandering must have  been purely mechanical: but one day I came to myself just as the sun  was setting. I felt weak and exhausted but perfectly sane. I was  parched, and my water-skin was gone, probably thrown away in a fit of  frenzy or despair I could not remember.    The horses, mere wrecks of what they had been, were munching the last  of a small patch of t'samma; and I was barely in time to rescue a  couple of still eatable ones, to moisten my parched tongue.    I had no idea how long I had been lying there unconscious, but the idea  of pushing north had now become an obsession with me, and I staggered  to the highest dune to look around me. I was still in a wilderness of  dunes, but I noticed that what little vegetation there was, was new and  strange to me; indeed, except for the t'samma there was scarce a bush  or plant I could recognize.    It was evident that I had traveled far in my delirium, and my heart  bounded, as I made out, away to the north, a kopje of rugged rocks  rising from the dunes. Here, apparently, then, I was at length reaching  the confines of this wilderness of sand, for these were the first rocks  that I had seen since we entered the desert it seemed a lifetime back!    The kopje was in the right direction too, for Inyati had said \"keep  north\" and by reaching it I should at least be able to spy out the  land.    I lost no time in saddling up, finding that I had still a small amount  of biltong and plenty of ammunition left. Nearly all night I trekked  through barren dunes, but these were now small and easy to traverse  compared to the mountains of sand I had already passed through, and  when I lay down for an hour before dawn I felt sure daylight would show  me to be near the kopje. Such was the case, for I found myself barely a  mile from it, and soon "]]]
