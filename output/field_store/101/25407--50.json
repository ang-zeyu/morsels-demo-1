Mrs.  Halliday had arranged with some of the North Point people to keep it  well attended to, but Freda cried at leaving it.    \"Don't feel badly about it, dear,\" comforted Mrs. Halliday. \"We are  coming back every summer to see it. It will always be our grave.\"    Freda slipped her hand into Mrs. Halliday's and smiled up at her.    \"I'd never have found you, Aunty, if it hadn't been for this grave,\"  she said happily. \"I'm so glad I adopted it.\"          How Don Was Saved      Will Barrie went whistling down the lane of the Locksley farm, took a  short cut over a field of clover aftermath and through a sloping  orchard where the trees were laden with apples, and emerged into the  farmhouse yard where Curtis Locksley was sitting on a pile of logs,  idly whittling at a stick.    \"You look as if you had a corner in time, Curt,\" said Will. \"I call  that luck, for I want you to go chestnutting up to Grier's Hill with  me. I met old Tom Grier on the road yesterday, and he told me I might  go any day. Nice old man, Tom Grier.\"    \"Good!\" said Curtis heartily, as he sprang up. \"If I haven't exactly a  corner in time, I have a day off, at least. Uncle doesn't need me  today. Wait till I whistle for Don. May as well take him with us.\"    Curtis whistled accordingly, but Don, his handsome Newfoundland dog,  did not appear. After calling and whistling about the yard and barns  for several minutes, Curtis turned away disappointedly.    \"He can't be anywhere around. It is very strange. Don never used to go  away from home without me, but lately he has been missing several  times, and twice last week he wasn't here in the morning and didn't  turn up until midday.\"    \"I'd keep him shut up until I broke him of the habit of playing  truant, if I were you,\" said Will, as they turned into the lane.    \"Don hates to be shut up, howls all the time so mournfully that I  can't stand it,\" responded Curtis.    \"Well,\" said Will, hesitatingly, \"maybe that would be better after all  than letting him stray away with other dogs who may teach him bad  habits. I saw Don myself one evening last week ambling down the  Harbour road with that big brown dog of Sam Ventnor's. Ventnor's dog  is beginning to have a bad reputation, you know. There have been  several sheep worried lately, and--\"    \"Don wouldn't touch a sheep!\" interrupted Curtis hotly.    \"I daresay not, not yet. But Ventnor's dog is under suspicion, and if  Don runs with him he'll learn the trick sure as preaching. The farmers  are growling a good bit already, and if they hear of Don and Ventnor's  dog going about in company, they'll put it on them both. Better keep  Don shut up awhile, let him howl as he likes.\"    \"I believe I will,\" said Curtis soberly. \"I don't want Don to fall  under suspicion of sheep-worrying, though I'm sure he would never do  it. Anyhow, I don't want him to run with Ventnor's dog. I'll chain him  up in the barn when I go home. I couldn't stand it if anything  happened to Don. After you, he's the only chum I've got--and he's a  good one.\"    Will agreed. He was almost as fond of Don as Curtis was. But he did  not feel so sure that the dog would not worry a sheep. Will knew that  Don was suspected already, but he did not like to tell Curtis so. And  of course there was as yet no positive proof--merely mutterings and  suggestions among the Bayside farmers who had lost sheep and were  anxious to locate their slayer. There were many other dogs in Bayside  and the surrounding districts who were just as likely to be the guilty  animals, and Will hoped that if Don were shut up for a time, suspicion  might be averted from him, especially if the worryings still went on.    He had felt a little doubtful about hinting the truth to Curtis, who  was a high-spirited lad and always resented any slur cast upon Don  much more bitterly than if it were meant for himself. But he knew that  Curtis would take it better from him than from the other Bayside boys,  one or the other of whom would be sure soon to cast something up to  Curtis about his dog. Will felt decidedly relieved to find that Curtis  took his advice in the spirit in which it was offered.    \"Who have lost sheep lately?\" queried Curtis, as they left the main  road and struck into a wood path through the ranks of beeches on Tom  Grier's land.    \"Nearly everybody on the Hollow farms,\" answered Will. \"Until last  week nobody on the Hill farms had lost any. But Tuesday night old Paul  Stockton had six fine sheep killed in his upland pasture behind the  fir woods. He is furious about it, I believe, and vows he'll find out  what dog did it and have him shot.\"    Curtis looked grave. Paul Stockton's farm was only about a quarter of  a mile from the Locksley homestead, and he knew that Paul had an old  family grudge against his Uncle Arnold, which included his nephew and  all belonging to him. Moreover, Curtis remembered with a sinking heart  that Wednesday morning had been one of the mornings upon which Don was  missing.    \"But I don't care!\" he thought miserably. \"I know Don didn't kill  those sheep.\"    \"Talking of old Paul,\" said Will, who thought it advisable to turn the  conversation, \"reminds me that they are getting anxious at the Harbour  about George Finley's schooner, the _Amy Reade_. She was due three  days ago and there's no sign of her yet. And there have been two bad  gales since she left Morro. Oscar Stockton is on board of her, you  know, and his father is worried about him. There are five other men on  her, all from the Harbour, and their folks down there are pretty wild  about the schooner.\"    Nothing more was said about the sheep, and soon, in the pleasures of  chestnutting, Curtis forgot his anxiety. Old Tom Grier had called to  the boys as they passed his house to come back and have dinner there  when the time came. This they did, and it was late in the afternoon  when Curtis, with his bag of chestnuts over his shoulder, walked into  the Locksley yard.    His uncle was standing before the open barn doors, talking to an  elderly, grizzled man with a thin, shrewd face.    Curtis's heart sank as he recognized old Paul Stockton. What could  have brought him over?    \"Curtis,\" called his uncle, \"come here.\"    As Curtis crossed the yard, Don came bounding down the slope from the  house to meet him. He put his hand on the dog's big head and the two  of them walked slowly to the barn. Old Paul included them both in a  vindictive scowl.    \"Curtis,\" said his uncle gravely, \"here's a bad business. Mr.  Stockton tells me that your dog has been worrying his sheep.\"    \"It's a--\" began Curtis angrily. Then he checked himself and went on  more calmly.    \"That can't be so, Mr. Stockton. My dog would not harm anything.\"    \"He killed or helped to kill six of the finest sheep in my flock!\"  retorted old Paul.    \"What proof have you of it?\" demanded Curtis, trying to keep his anger  within bounds.    \"Abner Peck saw your dog and Ventnor's running together through my  sheep pasture at sundown on Tuesday evening,\" answered old Paul.  \"Wednesday morning I found this in the corner of the pasture where the  sheep were worried. Your uncle admits that it was tied around your  dog's neck on Tuesday.\"    And old Paul held out triumphantly a faded red ribbon. Curtis  recognized it at a glance. It was the ribbon his little cousin, Lena,  had tied around Don's neck Tuesday afternoon. He remembered how they  had laughed at the effect of that frivolous red collar and bow on  Don's massive body.    \"I'm sure Don isn't guilty!\" he cried passionately.    Mr. Locksley shook his head.    \"I'm afraid he is, Curtis. The case looks very black against him, and  sheep-stealing is a serious offence.\"    \"The dog must be shot,\" said old Paul decidedly. \"I leave the matter  in your hands, Mr. Locksley. I've got enough proof to convict the dog  and, if you don't have him killed, I'll make you pay for the sheep he  worried.\"    As old Paul strode away, Curtis looked beseechingly at his uncle.    \"Don mustn't be shot, Uncle!\" he said desperately. \"I'll chain him up  all the time.\"    \"And have him howling night and day as if we had a brood of banshees  about the place?\" said Mr. Locksley sarcastically. He was a stern man  with little sentiment in his nature and no understanding whatever of  Curtis's affection for Don. The Bayside people said that Arnold  Locksley had always been very severe with his nephew. \"No, no, Curtis,  you must look at the matter sensibly. The dog is a nuisance and must  be shot. You can't keep him shut up forever, and, if he has once  learned the trick of sheep-worrying, he will never forget it. You can  get another dog if you must have one. I'll get Charles Pippey to come  and shoot Don tomorrow. No sulking now, Curtis. You are too big a boy  for that. Tie the dog up for the night and then go and put the calves  in. There is a storm coming. The wind is blowing hard from the  northeast now.\"    His uncle walked away, leaving the boy white and miserable in the  yard. He looked at Don, who sat on his haunches and returned his gaze  frankly and open-heartedly. He did not look like a guilty dog. Could  it be possible that he had really worried those sheep?    \"I'll never believe it of you, old fellow!\" Curtis said, as he led the  dog into a corner of the carriage house and tied him up there. Then he  flung himself down on a pile of sacks beside him and buried his face  in Don's curly black fur. The boy felt sullen, rebellious and  wretched.    He lay there until dark, thinking his own bitter thoughts and  listening to the rapidly increasing gale. Finally he got up and flung  off after the calves, with Don's melancholy howls at finding himself  deserted ringing in his ears.    He'll be quiet enough tomorrow night, thought Curtis wretchedly, as he  went upstairs to bed after housing the calves. For a long while he lay  awake, but finally dropped into a heavy slumber which lasted "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24876"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 (#9)"],[1,"him.\"    \"Well, I didn't expect he would. You'll have a holiday on New Year's  anyhow; whether you'll have anything to eat or not is a different  question.\"    \"I've an invitation to dinner,\" said Bertie timidly, \"me and William  John. It's from Doctor Forbes's little girls--the ones that gave me  the mittens.\"    He handed her the little note, and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it  by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove.    \"Well, you can please yourself,\" she said as she handed it back, \"but  William John couldn't go if he had ten invitations. He caught cold  coasting yesterday. I told him he would, but he was bound to go, and  now he's laid up for a week. Listen to him barking in the bedroom  there.\"    \"Well, then, I won't go either,\" said Bertie with a sigh, it might be  of relief, or it might be of disappointment. \"I wouldn't go there all  alone.\"    \"You're a goose!\" said his aunt. \"They wouldn't eat you. But as I  said, please yourself. Anyhow, hold your tongue about it to William  John, or you'll have him crying and bawling to go too.\"    The caution came too late. William John had already heard it, and when  his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment, she found him with  the ragged quilt over his head crying.    \"Come, William John, I want to rub you.\"    \"I don't want to be rubbed--g'way,\" sobbed William John. \"I heard you  out there--you needn't think I didn't. Bertie's going to Doctor  Forbes's to dinner and I can't go.\"    \"Well, you've only yourself to thank for it,\" returned his mother. \"If  you hadn't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you  to stay in, you'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes's. Little boys  who won't do as they're told always get into trouble. Stop crying,  now. I dare say if Bertie goes they'll send you some candy, or  something.\"    But William John refused to be comforted. He cried himself to sleep  that night, and when Bertie went in to see him next morning, he found  him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded  quilt drawn up around his pinched face.    \"Well, William John, how are you?\"    \"I ain't any better,\" replied William John mournfully. \"I s'pose  you'll have a great time tomorrow night, Bertie?\"    \"Oh, I'm not going since you can't,\" said Bertie cheerily. He thought  this would comfort William John, but it had exactly the opposite  effect. William John had cried until he could cry no more, but he  turned around and sobbed.    \"There now!\" he said in tearless despair. \"That's just what I  expected. I did s'pose if I couldn't go you would, and tell me about  it. You're mean as mean can be.\"    \"Come now, William John, don't be so cross. I thought you'd rather  have me home, but I'll go, if you want me to.\"    \"Honest, now?\"    \"Yes, honest. I'll go anywhere to please you. I must be off to the  store now. Goodbye.\"    Thus committed, Bertie took his courage in both hands and went. The  next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes's door with  a very violently beating heart. He was carefully dressed in his  well-worn best suit and a neat white collar. The frosty air had  crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face.    Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour, where Edith  and Amy were eagerly awaiting him.    \"Happy New Year, Bertie,\" cried Amy. \"And--but, why, where is William  John?\"    \"He couldn't come,\" answered Bertie anxiously--he was afraid he might  not be welcome without William John. \"He's real sick. He caught cold  and has to stay in bed; but he wanted to come awful bad.\"    \"Oh, dear me! Poor William John!\" said Amy in a disappointed tone. But  all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes.    \"How do you do?\" he said, giving Bertie's hand a hearty shake. \"But  where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting?\"    Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John's non-appearance.    \"It's a bad time for colds,\" said the doctor, sitting down and  attacking the fire. \"I dare say, though, you have to run so fast these  days that a cold couldn't catch you. I suppose you'll soon be leaving  Sampson's. He told me he didn't need you after the holiday season was  over. What are you going at next? Have you anything in view?\"    Bertie shook his head sorrowfully.    \"No, sir; but,\" he added more cheerfully, \"I guess I'll find something  if I hunt around lively. I almost always do.\"    He forgot his shyness; his face flushed hopefully, and he looked  straight at the doctor with his bright, earnest eyes. The doctor poked  the fire energetically and looked very wise. But just then the girls  came up and carried Bertie off to display their holiday gifts. And  there was a fur cap and a pair of mittens for him! He wondered whether  he was dreaming.    \"And here's a picture-book for William John,\" said Amy, \"and there is  a sled out in the kitchen for him. Oh, there's the dinner-bell. I'm  awfully hungry. Papa says that is my 'normal condition,' but I don't  know what that means.\"    As for that dinner--Bertie might sometimes have seen such a repast in  delightful dreams, but certainly never out of them. It was a feast to  be dated from.    When the plum pudding came on, the doctor, who had been notably  silent, leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and  looked critically at Bertie.    \"So Mr. Sampson can't keep you?\"    Bertie's face sobered at once. He had almost forgotten his  responsibilities.    \"No, sir. He says I'm too small for the heavy work.\"    \"Well, you are rather small--but no doubt you will grow. Boys have a  queer habit of doing that. I think you know how to make yourself  useful. I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse. If  you like, I'll try you. You can live here, and go to school. I  sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds, and the first good one  that will suit you, I'll bespeak for you. How will that do?\"    \"Oh, sir, you are too good,\" said Bertie with a choke in his voice.    \"Well, that is settled,\" said the doctor genially. \"Come on Monday  then. And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap,  William, or John, or whatever his name is. Will you have some more  pudding, Bertie?\"    \"No, thank you,\" said Bertie. Pudding, indeed! He could not have eaten  another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune.    After dinner they played games, and cracked nuts, and roasted apples,  until the clock struck nine; then Bertie got up to go.    \"Off, are you?\" said the doctor, looking up from his paper. \"Well,  I'll expect you on Monday, remember.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Bertie happily. He was not likely to forget.    As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled.    \"Here is William John's present. I've tied all the other things on so  that they can't fall off.\"    Edith was at the door-with a parcel. \"Here are some nuts and candies  for William John,\" she said. \"And tell him we all wish him a 'Happy  New Year.'\"    \"Thank you,\" said Bertie. \"I've had a splendid time. I'll tell William  John. Goodnight.\"    He stepped out. It was frostier than ever. The snow crackled and  snapped, the stars were keen and bright, but to Bertie, running down  the street with William John's sled thumping merrily behind him, the  world was aglow with rosy hope and promise. He was quite sure he could  never forget this wonderful New Year.          Between the Hill and the Valley      It was one of the moist, pleasantly odorous nights of early spring.  There was a chill in the evening air, but the grass was growing green  in sheltered spots, and Jeffrey Miller had found purple-petalled  violets and pink arbutus on the hill that day. Across a valley filled  with beech and fir, there was a sunset afterglow, creamy yellow and  pale red, with a new moon swung above it. It was a night for a man to  walk alone and dream of his love, which was perhaps why Jeffrey Miller  came so loiteringly across the springy hill pasture, with his hands  full of the mayflowers.    He was a tall, broad-shouldered man of forty, and looking no younger,  with dark grey eyes and a tanned, clean-cut face, clean-shaven save  for a drooping moustache. Jeffrey Miller was considered a handsome  man, and Bayside people had periodical fits of wondering why he had  never married. They pitied him for the lonely life he must lead alone  there at the Valley Farm, with only a deaf old housekeeper as a  companion, for it did not occur to the Bayside people in general that  a couple of shaggy dogs could be called companions, and they did not  know that books make very excellent comrades for people who know how  to treat them.    One of Jeffrey's dogs was with him now--the oldest one, with white  breast and paws and a tawny coat. He was so old that he was half-blind  and rather deaf, but, with one exception, he was the dearest of living  creatures to Jeffrey Miller, for Sara Stuart had given him the  sprawly, chubby little pup years ago.    They came down the hill together. A group of men were standing on the  bridge in the hollow, discussing Colonel Stuart's funeral of the day  before. Jeffrey caught Sara's name and paused on the outskirts of the  group to listen. Sometimes he thought that if he were lying dead under  six feet of turf and Sara Stuart's name were pronounced above him, his  heart would give a bound of life.    \"Yes, the old kunnel's gone at last,\" Christopher Jackson was saying.  \"He took his time dyin', that's sartain. Must be a kind of relief for  Sara--she's had to wait on him, hand and foot, for years. But no doubt  she'll feel pretty lonesome. Wonder what she'll do?\"    \"Is there any particular reason for her to do anything?\" asked Alec  Churchill.    \"Well, she'll have to leave Pinehurst. The estate's entailed and goes  to her cousin, Charles Stuart.\"    There were exclamations of surprise from the other men on hearing  this. Jeffrey drew nearer, absently patting his"]]]
