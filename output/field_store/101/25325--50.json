Human friendships are limited; but to the number of our most intimate  acquaintances in cloth, vellum, and morocco, there is no end.    It is this universal sympathy afforded by our books that makes our  sanctum such a delicious retreat. Here we need never be bored, for we can  put aside the tedious or insipid at will, and turn to whatever subject or  companion our fancy indicates. We are not bound to talk with persons or  on themes that have no interest for us. There is no clashing of ideas,  and complete harmony reigns amid our comfort.    To the man of literary tastes there are few things more depressing than  the conversations of 'small-talk' which an exacting society occasionally  demands. Who has not suffered from their enervating effects? We are not  all possessed of that mental abstraction which La Fontaine succeeded in  carrying with him throughout life, forming a buffer from which all idle  talk rebounded. He was once asked to dinner by a 'fermier-general' to  amuse the guests. Thoroughly bored, La Fontaine ate much and said little,  and rising very early from the table said that he had to go to the  Academy. 'Oh,' said his host, 'but you are much too early for it.' 'Oh  well,' replied Jean, '_I shall go the longest way to it._' Poor Jean was  really very absent-minded. He had a son whom he confided at the age of  fourteen to a friend to educate. Not having seen the youth for a long  time, he met him one day at the house of a savant without knowing him.  Afterwards he happened to mention that he thought him a youth of wit and  taste. Some one told him that the lad was his own son. 'Is he indeed,'  said Jean, 'well I'm very glad to hear it.'    There is no end to the delightful hobbies that we may cultivate in a  library. Here we may go fishing or whaling, fighting battles or exploring  new countries, tracing pedigrees or going on crusade, cutting our way  through virgin forests or filling herbaceous borders in our mind, or we  may even descend into the pyramid of Cheops.    Our book-hunter has a friend whose hobby takes the form of tracing the  parentage and posterity of men who lived long years ago. They are mostly  unknown to fame, and their names are only to be found in ancient peerages  and suchlike books. Whether they were good or bad, religious or wicked,  useful to their country or indifferent, handsome or ugly, is immaterial  to him. In some cases they founded families that have endured, in others  they perished with all their kindred within a century of the Norman  Conquest. But to our genealogist they are very living people. He is  intimately acquainted with the most of them, no less than with their  wives and children, their fathers and grandfathers, their uncles and  their aunts. As to the personal characteristics of Reginald Fitz-Ranulf  lord of Bosham Castle in Com. Ebor, or his deeds or memorable actions  (if, indeed, he ever perpetrated any) this student is unable to enlighten  us. But that his wife was called Gunnora and that she was a daughter and  co-heir of Richard de Tourville, he is quite positive. Apparently they  had two sons, Fulk and Waleran, but our friend is strongly of opinion  that Hamon FitzReginald (who had a moiety of the manor of Worthleys and  was co-parcener with Payn FitzGeoffrey lord of Buncombe) was really a son  of Reginald by a former wife.    The memory of this eager student is little short of marvellous. He can  remember not only names and marriages, but at least several of the  families which owned any manor that you like to mention. He would  certainly have put to the blush Pierre d'Hozier, the great French  genealogist whose memory was so wonderful that it was said he must surely  have been present at all the marriages and baptisms in Christendom!    The library of this genealogist is a most interesting room. Many of the  books necessary for his researches are of folio size and must be ready to  hand; so they are ranged round the apartment at the level of one's waist.  On entering the room one is struck by this belt of massive volumes, the  more so when their owner takes them up casually and turns to page after  page without ever troubling to refer to the index.    An evening spent with him is quite exciting. He asks the book-hunter's  assistance over a knotty point. Several huge sheets of paper are laid  upon the table, and each step in the pedigree is debated graphically.  Volume after volume is referred to. At the slightest hitch out come  Patent Rolls, Close Rolls, Fine Rolls, Pipe Rolls, and records of almost  every description. Presently the room has the appearance of having been  struck by a tornado. Volumes are lying about everywhere, and in every  conceivable position. The floor is covered with them, all the chairs are  in use, three Patent Rolls are lying open and face downwards on the  mantelpiece, there are several on the hearthrug. In fact it is now  impossible to move. Yet our host, accustomed to these things, in his  search for a volume jumps from spot to spot with the agility of an  antelope. The book-shelves are half-emptied, some of the remaining  volumes have fallen down. My coffee cup lies on a pile composed of  _Rotuli Hundredorum_, a _Placita Abbreviatio_, and a _Testa de Nevil_.  But it is good fun, if exhausting, and a sovereign cure for insomnia. Our  book-hunter usually leaves him about one o'clock in the morning, and the  genealogist is genuinely sorry when he goes.    But to tell the truth our bookman is not a bit the wiser as to Reginald  FitzRanulf!    One day friend Brown (for so he is called) came to see the book-hunter in  great distress. He had but lately become a parent, and was still slightly  excited about it.    ''Pon my word,' said he, 'I don't know what to do. You know how proud I  am of my family, and how I hoped all along that it would be a boy so that  I could give it the name that generations of my ancestors possessed. And  now Mary says she won't hear of it.'    The bookman sympathised with him, but asked what was the proposed name.    'Turchetil,' said he; 'they were all called that for generations. But of  course the name wasn't Brown then, Le Brun was the family name in the  twelfth century.'    'A fine lofty name,' replied his friend, 'but wouldn't Turchetil Brown  sound rather funny nowadays?'    'I don't see why,' said he stiffly; 'they're both good old names.'    The bookman assented, though inwardly he could not but agree with Mrs.  Brown. Turchetil Le Brun was one thing, and Turchetil Brown quite  another. Perhaps, however, a compromise might be reached.    'Is there no other ancient name in your family that would do?' he  suggested.    'Yes,' said the genealogist, 'there are two others, but not so good as  Turchetil. They are Baldric and Bigod . . .'    Truly the study of genealogy has its disadvantages. There must have been  great bitterness in the Brown household before its mistress obtained her  own way, and even more in the heart of our poor friend as he stood at the  font and heard his firstborn son irrevocably named--George.    Another friend and brother collector with whom our book-hunter sometimes  passes an evening is a medical man of no small talent. But attached as he  is to his profession, archaeology is for ever striving with medicine for  the first place in his affections, and his knowledge of herbals and the  literature of alchemy is immense. His collection of works dealing with  these subjects is well known to the booksellers, and the book-hunter  sometimes receives a line from him asking him to pay a visit for the  purpose of examining some recently acquired treasure.    Of late his hobby has taken a curious turn. A chance conversation induced  him to inquire into the death of Queen Anne. He professed to discover, in  the accounts of her demise, certain symptoms which indicated a different  disease from that usually assigned to her. So now he must needs hold an  inquest upon the death of each one of our sovereigns, from the time of  King William the Conqueror. He is exceedingly enthusiastic about it, and  is preparing a paper to read before the local antiquarian society. In  this he hopes to prove conclusively the impossibility of lampreys having  had any share in the death of Henry the First, which was clearly due to  appendicitis.    Sometimes when the book-hunter visited his medical friend he would find  another collector there already, deep in bookish or scientific talk. Like  the doctor, the biologist was a specialist in books no less than in  science, and his hobby comprised a field till recent times untilled. Keen  though he was in his pursuit, it was the sea that claimed his every day  of leisure. An active mind, eager in the elucidation of the more abstruse  problems of physiology, yet his alert bearing, his quickness of movement  and springy step, spoke more of the quarterdeck than the laboratory.  Denied the sea as a profession, his heart was for ever in ships; and when  at length preferment took him inland to one of the ancient seats of  learning, the ordered training of his mind turned his hobby towards the  history and evolution of all craft that sail upon the waters.    He is a great authority upon all matters pertaining to the rigging of  mediaeval ships. The history of their hulls he leaves to the attention of  the important societies of nautical research. But on the evolution of the  sky-topsail or fore-top-gallant-backstays his word carries much weight.  He will travel a hundred miles in a week-end to see an illumination or  carving of a ship, and his vacations he spends touring France and  Flanders in search of stained glass windows that may throw some light  upon his hobby. His collection of seals incised with ancient ships is a  fine one, and the proceedings of more than one society are the richer for  his researches.    Not long ago I came across another example of the manifold uses to which  a private library can be put. A friend had given me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22718"],[0,"Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France, Volume 1 (#9)"],[1," the type of the church of this coast, with  its unpretentious smallness, its strength, and its disfiguring  restorations; and it is, especially in comparison with Vence and  Grasse, of small architectural interest. The facade, and the double  archway which connects the church and the tower, are of the  unfortunate XVIII century, the older exterior is monotonous, and the  interior, an unpleasing confusion of forms.    [Illustration: \"THE MILITARY OMEN--THE TOWER.\" ANTIBES.]    The real interest of the little Cathedral is its ancient military  strength, neither very grand nor very imposing, but very real to the  enemy who hundreds of years ago hurled himself against the hard, plain  stones. From this view-point, the mannered facade and the inharmonious  interior matter but little. Toward the foe, whose sail might have arisen  on the horizon at any moment, the protecting church presented the heavy  rounded walls and safely narrowed windows of its three apses, and behind  them the military omen of the severe, rectangular tower. High in every  one of its four sides, seaward and landward, was a window, from which  many a watcher must have looked and strained anxious eyes. This is the  significance of the little sea-side Cathedral, this the story its tower  suggests. And now when the sea is sailed by peaceful ships, and the  Cathedral only a place of pious worship, the tower with its gaping  windows is the only salient reminder of the ancient dignity of the  church; the reminder to an indifferent generation of the days when  Antibes fulfilled to Christians the promise of her old, pagan name,  Antipolis, \"sentinel\" of the perilous sea.      [Sidenote: Nice.]    The situation of its Cathedral reveals a Nice of which but little is  written, the city of a people who live in the service of those whose  showy, new villas and hotels stretch along the promenades and lie dotted  on the hills in the Nice of \"all the world.\" Besides this exotic city,  there is \"the Nice of the Nicois,\" a small district of dark, crowded  streets that are too full of the sordid struggles of competing  work-people to be truly picturesque. Here, in the XVI century,  when the Citadel of Nice was enlarged and the Cathedral of  Sainte-Marie-de-l'Assomption destroyed, the Church of Sainte-Reparate  was re-built, and succeeded to the episcopal rank. Standing on a little  open square, surrounded by small shops and the poor homes of  trades-folk, it seems in every sense a church of the people. Here the  native Nicois, gay, industrious, mercurial, and dispossessed of his  town, may feel truly at home. Finished in the most exuberant rococo  style, it is an edifice from which all architectural or religious  inspiration is conspicuously absent. It is a revel of luxurious bad  taste; a Cathedral in Provence, a Cathedral by the Sea, but neither  Provencal nor Maritime,--rather a product of that Italian taste which  has so profoundly vitiated both the morals and the architecture of all  the Riviera.          II.    CATHEDRALS OF THE HILL-TOWNS.      [Sidenote: Carpentras.]    Carpentras is a busy provincial town, the terminus of three diminutive  railroads and of many little, lumbering, dust-covered stages. It stands  high on a hill, and from the boulevards, dusty promenades under  luxuriant shade-trees, which circle the town as its walls formerly did,  there is an extended view over the pretty hills and valleys of the  neighbouring country. At one end of the town the Hospital rises, an  immense, bare, and imposing edifice of the XVIII century, built by a  Trappist Bishop; and at the other is the Orange Gate, the last tower of  the old fortifications. Between these historic buildings and the  encircling boulevards are the narrow streets and irregular,  uninteresting buildings of the city itself. It is strange indeed that so  isolated a place, which seems only a big, bustling country-town, should  have been of importance in the Middle Ages, and that bits of its  stirring history must have caused all orthodox Europe to thrill with  horror. Stranger still would be the forgetfulness of modern writers, by  whom Carpentras is seldom mentioned, were it not that the city's real  history is that of the Church political, a story of strange manners and  happenings, rather than a step in the vital evolution towards our own  time.    In the Middle Ages Carpentras was an episcopal city, the capital of the  County Venaissin, governed by wealthy, powerful, and ambitious Bishops,  who took no small interest in worldly aggrandisement. Passing by gift to  the Papacy, after the sudden death of Clement V it was selected as the  place of the Conclave which was to elect his successor. The members were  assembled in the great episcopal Palace, when Bertrand de Goth, a nephew  of the dead Pope, claiming to be an ally of the French prelates against  the Italians in the Conclave, arrived from a successful looting of the  papal treasury at Montreux to pillage in Carpentras. He and his  mercenaries massacred the citizens and burned the Cathedral. The  episcopal Palace caught fire, and their Eminences--in danger of their  lives--were forced to squeeze their sacred persons through a hole which  their followers made in the Palace wall and fly northward.    This unfortunate raid left Carpentras with many ruins and a demolished  Cathedral, deserted by those in whose cause she had unwittingly  suffered. The new Pontiff was safely elected in Lyons, and upon his  return to the papal seat of Avignon he administered Carpentras by a  \"rector,\" and it continued as it had been before, the political capital  of the County. During the reigns of succeeding Popes it was apparently  undisturbed by dangerous honours, until the accession of the Anti-Pope,  Benedict XIII. So great was this prelate's delight in the city that he  reserved to himself the minor title of her Bishop, re-built her walls,  and was the first patron of the present and very orthodox Cathedral,  Saint-Siffrein. By a curious destiny, the church had this false prelate  not only as its first patron, but as its first active supporter; and in  1404 he sent Artaud, Archbishop of Arles, in his name, to lay its first  stone.    Wars and rumours of wars soon possessed the province. Benedict fled, and  through unrest and lack of money the work of Cathedral building was  greatly hindered. In the meantime the ruins of the former Cathedral seem  to have been gradually disintegrating, and in 1829 the last of its  Cloister was destroyed, to be replaced by prison cells; and now only the  choir dome and a suggestion of the nave exist, partly forming the  present sacristy. From these meagre remains and from writings of the  time, it may be fairly inferred that Saint-Pierre was a Cathedral of the  type of Avignon and Cavaillon and the old Marseillaise Church of La  Majeure, and that, architecturally considered, it was a far more  important structure than Saint-Siffrein. With this depressing knowledge  in mind the traveller was confronted with a sight as depressing--the  present Cathedral itself.    Fortunately, churches of a period antedating the XVII century are seldom  so uninteresting. Nothing more meagre nor dreary can be conceived than  the facade with its three, poor, characterless portals. They open on a  large vaulted hall, with chapels in its six bays and a small and narrow  choir. The principal charm of the interior is negative; its dim misty  light, by concealing a mass of tasteless decorations and the poverty and  bareness of the whole architectural scheme, gives to the generous height  and size of the room an atmosphere of subdued and mysterious  spaciousness. The south door is the one bit of this Gothic which passes  the commonplace. Set in a poor, plain wall, the portal has a graceful  symmetry of design; and its few carved details, probably limited by the  artistic power of its builder, are so simple and chaste that they do not  inevitably suggest poverty of conception. The tympanum holds an exotic  detail, a defaced and insignificant fresco of the Coronation of the  Virgin; and on the pier which divides the door-way stands a very  charming statue of Our Lady of Snows, blessing those who enter beneath  her outstretched hands.    This simple portal, and indeed the whole church, is a significant  example of Provencal Gothic, a style so foreign to the genius of the  province that it could produce only feeble and attenuated examples of  the art. Compared with its northern prototypes, it is surprisingly  tentative; and awkward, unaccustomed hands seem to have built it after  most primitive conceptions.      [Sidenote: Digne.]    Well outside the Alpine city of Digne, and almost surrounded by graves,  stands a small and ancient church which is seldom opened except for the  celebration of Masses for the Dead. Coffin-rests stand always before the  altar, and enough chairs for the few that mourn. There are old  candlesticks for the tapers of the church's poor, and hidden in the  shadows of the doors, a few broken crosses that once marked graves,  placed, tenderly perhaps, above those who were alive some years ago and  who now rest forgotten; on battered wood, one can still read a baby's  age, an old man's record, and the letters R. I. P.    In this strange, melancholy destiny of Notre-Dame-du-Bourg there seems  to be a peculiar fitness. The mutability of time, forgetfulness, and at  length neglect, which death suggests, are brought to mind by this old  church. Once the Cathedral of Digne, but no longer Cathedral, it stands  almost alone in spite of its honours and its venerable age. After the  desecration by the Huguenots, its episcopal birthright was given to a  younger and a larger church; the city has moved away and clusters about  its new Cathedral, Saint-Jerome; and Notre-Dame-du-Bourg is no longer on  a busy street, but near the dusty high-road, amid the quiet of the  country and the hills.    Parts of its crypt and tower may antedate 900,"]]]
