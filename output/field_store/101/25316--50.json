For the sake of rapid reading he would like to have every wide  page printed in columns. For the same reason he would like to have every  possible help given to the eye in the way of paragraphs, headlines, and  variation of type, so far as it can be given in consonance with the  esthetic rights of the book. With these points observed, and the book  printed on paper as thin and as light in weight as can be conveniently  used and is consistent with opacity and strength, with clear type, clear  and durable ink, and good presswork, the printer will have done his  part, and a book will go to the binder that is worthy of his best  treatment.    What that treatment is the binder knows better than I can tell him. When  he has applied it, the book will come out of his hands at once solid and  flexible; unmutilated, either on the outer edges where mutilation can be  seen, or at the back where it cannot be seen, but where it nevertheless  hurts the integrity of the book; covered with honest boards that will  stand use, and clad with a material, cloth or leather, that is both  strong to resist wear and also contains within itself no seeds of  deterioration. Besides this let it have a character, however  unobtrusive, befitting the contents of the book, and the binder will  have paid his full debt to the present and the future.    While the librarian's ideals of bookmaking are not the only ones, they  are in harmony with the best, and there cannot be progress in bookmaking  without approaching his ideals. He is, therefore, by his very office  committed to every undertaking for the improvement of the book, and  because of the efforts of librarians and other booklovers there is  ground for belief that the books of the present decade will be better  than those of the last.          THE BOOK BEAUTIFUL      We who use books every day as tools of trade or sources of inspiration  are apt to overlook the fact that the book, on its material side, is an  art object. Not, indeed, that it ranks with the products of poetry,  painting, sculpture, and other arts of the first grade; but it has a  claim to our consideration on the level of the minor arts, along with  jewelry, pottery, tapestry, and metal work. Moreover, its intimate  association with literature, of which it is the visible setting, gives  it a charm that, while often only reflected, may also be contributory,  heightening the beauty that it enshrines.    Using the word beauty for the result of artistic mastery, we may say  that in the other arts beauty is the controlling factor in price, but in  the book this is the case only exceptionally. As a consequence beautiful  books are more accessible for purchase or observation than any other  equally beautiful objects. For the price of a single very beautiful rug  one can obtain a small library of the choicest books. Except in the case  of certain masterpieces of the earliest printing, in which rarity is  joined to beauty, high prices for books have nothing to do with their  artistic quality. Even for incunabula one need pay only as many dollars  as for tapestries of the same grade one would have to pay thousands. In  book collecting, therefore, a shallow purse is not a bar to achievement,  and in our day of free libraries one may make good progress in the  knowledge and enjoyment of beautiful books without any expense at all.    Public taste is probably as advanced in the appreciation of the book  beautiful as of any other branch of art, but it is active rather than  enlightened. This activity is a good sign, for it represents the first  stage in comprehension; the next is the consciousness that there is more  in the subject than had been realized; the third is appreciation. The  present chapter is addressed to those--and they are many--who are in the  second stage. The first piece of advice to those who seek acquaintance  with the book beautiful is: Surround yourself with books that the best  judges you know call beautiful; inspect them, handle them; cultivate  them as you would friends. It will not be long before most other books  begin to annoy you, though at first you cannot tell why. Then specific  differences one after another will stand out, until at last you come to  know something of the various elements of the book, their possibilities  of beauty or ugliness, and their relations one to another. No one should  feel ashamed if this process takes a long time--is indeed endless.  William Morris pleaded to having sinned in the days of ignorance, even  after he had begun to make books. So wide is the field and so many and  subtle are the possible combinations that all who set out to know books  must expect, like the late John Richard Green, to \"die learning.\" But  the learning is so delightful and the company into which it brings us is  so agreeable that we have no cause to regret our lifelong  apprenticeship.    The first of all the qualities of the book beautiful is fitness. It must  be adapted to the literature which it contains, otherwise it will  present a contradiction. Imagine a \"Little Classic\" Josephus or a folio  Keats. The literature must also be worthy of a beautiful setting, else  the book will involve an absurdity. Have we not all seen presentation  copies of government documents which gave us a shock when we passed from  the elegant outside to the commonplace inside? But the ideal book will  go beyond mere fitness; it will be both an interpretation of its  contents and an offering of homage to its worth. The beauty of the whole  involves perfect balance as well as beauty of the parts. No one must  take precedence of the rest, but there must be such a perfect harmony  that we shall think first of the total effect and only afterwards of the  separate elements that combine to produce it. This greatly extends our  problem, but also our delight in its happy solutions.    The discerning reader has probably noticed that we have already smuggled  into our introduction the notion that the book beautiful is a printed  book; and, broadly speaking, so it must be at the present time. But we  should not forget that, while the printed book has charms and laws of  its own, the book was originally written by hand and in this form was  developed to a higher pitch of beauty than the printed book has ever  attained. As Ruskin says, \"A well-written book is as much pleasanter and  more beautiful than a printed book as a picture is than an engraving.\"  Calligraphy and illumination are to-day, if not lost arts, at best but  faint echoes of their former greatness. They represent a field of  artistic effort in which many persons of real ability might attain far  greater distinction and emolument than in the overcrowded ordinary  fields of art. Printing itself would greatly benefit from a flourishing  development of original bookmaking, gaining just that stimulus on the  art side that it needs to counterbalance the pressure of commercialism.  At present, however, we shall commit no injustice if, while remembering  its more perfect original, we accept the printed book as the  representative of the book beautiful; but, as a matter of fact, most  that we shall have to say of it will apply with little change to the  manuscript book.    A final point by way of preface is the relation of the book beautiful to  the well-made book. The two are not identical. A book may be legible,  strong, and durable, yet ill-proportioned and clumsy, ugly in every  detail. On the other hand, the book beautiful must be well made, else it  will not keep its beauty. The point where the two demands tend most to  conflict is at the hinge of the cover, where strength calls for  thickness of leather and beauty for thinness. The skill of the good  binder is shown in harmonizing these demands when he shaves the under  side of the leather for the joint. Let us now take up the elements of  the book one by one and consider their relations to beauty.    To one who never had seen a book before it would seem, as it stands on  the shelf or lies on the table, a curious rectangular block; and such it  is in its origin, being derived from the Roman codex, which was a block  of wood split into thin layers. When closed, therefore, the book must  have the seeming solidity of a block; but open it and a totally new  character appears. It is now a bundle of thin leaves, and its beauty no  longer consists in its solidity and squareness, but in the opposite  qualities of easy and complete opening, and flowing curves. This inner  contradiction, so far from making the book a compromise and a failure,  is one of the greatest sources of its charm, for each condition must be  met as if the other did not exist, and when both are so met, we derive  the same satisfaction as from any other combination of strength and  grace, such as Schiller celebrates in his \"Song of the Bell.\"    The book therefore consists of a stiff cover joined by a flexible  back--in the book beautiful a tight back--and inclosing highly flexible  leaves. The substance of the board is not visible, being covered with  an ornamental material, either cloth or leather, but it should be strong  and tough and in thickness proportioned to the size of the volume. In  very recent years we have available for book coverings really beautiful  cloths, which are also more durable than all but the best leathers; but  we have a right to claim for the book beautiful a covering of leather,  and full leather, not merely a back and hinges. We have a wide range of  beauty in leathers, from the old ivory of parchment--when it has had a  few centuries in which to ripen its color--to the sensuous richness of  calf and the splendor of crushed levant. The nature of the book must  decide, if the choice is yet to be made. But, when the book has been  covered with appropriate leather so deftly that the leather seems \"gr"]]]
