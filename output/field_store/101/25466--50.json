The clerk was again sent to the convent with a copy of this decision,  but the superior having listened to the reading of the document,  answered that in her own name and that of the sisterhood she refused to  recognise the jurisdiction of the bailiff; that she had already received  directions from the Bishop of Poitiers, dated 18th November, explaining  the measures which were to be taken in the matter, and she would gladly  send a copy of these directions to the bailiff, to prevent his pleading  ignorance of them; furthermore, she demurred to the order for her  removal, having vowed to live always secluded in a convent, and that no  one could dispense her from this vow but the bishop. This protest having  been made in the presence of Madame de Charnisay, aunt of two of the  nuns, and Surgeon Mannouri, who was related to another, they both united  in drawing up a protest against violence, in case the bailiff should  insist on having his orders carried out, declaring that, should he make  the attempt, they would resist him, as if he were a mere private  individual. This document being duly signed and witnessed was  immediately sent to the bailiff by the hand of his own clerk, whereupon  the bailiff ordered that preparations should be made with regard to the  sequestration, and announced that the next day, the 24th November, he  would repair to the convent and be present at the exorcisms.    The next day accordingly, at the appointed hour, the bailiff summoned  Daniel Roger, Vincent de Faux, Gaspard Joubert, and Matthieu Fanson, all  four physicians, to his presence, and acquainting them with his reasons  for having called them, asked them to accompany him to the convent to  examine, with the most scrupulous impartiality, two nuns whom he would  point out, in order to discover if their illness were feigned, or arose  from natural or supernatural causes. Having thus instructed them as to  his wishes, they all set out for the convent.    They were shown into the chapel and placed close to the altar, being  separated by a grating from the choir, in which the nuns who sang  usually sat. In a few moments the superior was carried in on a small  bed, which was laid down before the grating. Barre then said mass,  during which the superior went into violent convulsions. She threw her  arms about, her fingers were clenched, her cheeks enormously inflated,  and her eyes turned up so that only the whites could be seen.    The mass finished, Barre approached her to administer the holy communion  and to commence the exorcism. Holding the holy wafer in his hand, he  said--    \"Adora Deum tuum, creatorem tuum\" (Adore God, thy Creator).    The superior hesitated, as if she found great difficulty in making this  act of love, but at length she said--    \"Adoro te\" (I adore Thee).    \"Quem adoras?\" (Whom dost thou adore?)    \"Jesus Christus\" (Jesus Christ), answered the nun, quite unconscious  that the verb adorn governs accusative.    This mistake, which no sixth-form boy would make, gave rise to bursts of  laughter in the church; and Daniel Douin, the provost's assessor, was  constrained to say aloud--    \"There's a devil for you, who does not know much about transitive  verbs.\"    Barre perceiving the bad impression that the superior's nominative had  made, hastened to ask her--    \"Quis est iste quem adoras?\" (Who is it whom thou dost adore?)    His hope was that she would again reply \"Jesus Christus,\" but he was  disappointed.    \"Jesu Christe,\" was her answer.    Renewed shouts of laughter greeted this infraction of one of the most  elementary rules of syntax, and several of those present exclaimed:    \"Oh, your reverence, what very poor Latin!\"    Barre pretended not to hear, and next asked what was the name of the  demon who had taken possession of her. The poor superior, who was  greatly confused by the unexpected effect of her last two answers, could  not speak for a long time; but at length with great trouble she brought  out the name Asmodee, without daring to latinise it. The exorcist then  inquired how many devils the superior had in her body, and to this  question she replied quite fluently:    \"Sex\" (Six).    The bailiff upon this requested Barre to ask the chief devil how many  evil spirits he had with him. But the need for this answer had been  foreseen, and the nun unhesitatingly returned--    \"Quinque\" (Five).    This answer raised Asmodee somewhat in the opinion of those present; but  when the bailiff adjured the superior to repeat in Greek what she had  just said in Latin she made no reply, and on the adjuration being  renewed she immediately recovered her senses.    The examination of the superior being thus cut short, a little nun who  appeared for the first time in public was brought forward. She began by  twice pronouncing the name of Grandier with a loud laugh; then turning  to the bystanders, called out--    \"For all your number, you can do nothing worth while.\"    As it was easy to see that nothing of importance was to be expected from  this new patient, she was soon suppressed, and her place taken by the  lay sister Claire who had already made her debut in the mother  superior's room.    Hardly had she entered the choir than she uttered a groan, but as soon  as they placed her on the little bed on which the other nuns had lain,  she gave way to uncontrollable laughter, and cried out between the  paroxysms--    \"Grandier, Grandier, you must buy some at the market.\"    Barre at once declared that these wild and whirling words were a proof  of possession, and approached to exorcise the demon; but Sister Claire  resisted, and pretending to spit in the face of the exorcist, put out  her tongue at him, making indecent gestures, using a word in harmony  with her actions. This word being in the vernacular was understood by  everyone and required no interpretation.    The exorcist then conjured her to give the name of the demon who was in  her, and she replied--    \"Grandier.\"    But Barre by repeating his question gave her to understand that she had  made a mistake, whereupon she corrected herself and said--    \"Elimi.\"    Nothing in the world could induce her to reveal the number of evil  spirits by whom Elimi was accompanied, so that Barre, seeing that it was  useless to press her on this point, passed on to the next question.    \"Quo pacto ingressus est daemon.\" (By what pact did the demon get in?).    \"Duplex\" (Double), returned Sister Claire.    This horror of the ablative, when the ablative was absolutely necessary,  aroused once more the hilarity of the audience, and proved that Sister  Claire's devil was just as poor a Latin scholar as the superior's, and  Barre, fearing some new linguistic eccentricity on the part of the evil  spirit, adjourned the meeting to another day.    The paucity of learning shown in the answers of the nuns being  sufficient to convince any fairminded person that the whole affair was a  ridiculous comedy, the bailiff felt encouraged to persevere until he had  unravelled the whole plot. Consequently, at three o'clock in the  afternoon, he returned to the convent, accompanied by his clerk, by  several magistrates, and by a considerable number of the best known  people of Loudun, and asked to see the superior. Being admitted, he  announced to Barre that he had come to insist on the superior being  separated from Sister Claire, so that each could be exorcised apart.  Barre dared not refuse before such a great number of witnesses,  therefore the superior was isolated and the exorcisms begun all over  again. Instantly the convulsions returned, just as in the morning, only  that now she twisted her feet into the form of hooks, which was a new  accomplishment.    Having adjured her several times, the exorcist succeeded in making her  repeat some prayers, and then sounded her as to the name and number of  the demons in possession, whereupon she said three times that there was  one called Achaos. The bailiff then directed Barre to ask if she were  possessed 'ex pacto magi, aut ex Aura voluntate Dei' (by a pact with a  sorcerer or by the pure will of God), to which the superior answered    \"Non est voluutas Dei\" (Not by the will of God).    Upon this, Barre dreading more questions from the bystanders, hastily  resumed his own catechism by asking who was the sorcerer.    \"Urbanus,\" answered the superior.    \"Est-ne Urbanus papa\" (Is it Pope Urban?), asked the exorcist.    \"Grandier,\" replied the superior.    \"Quare ingressus es in corpus hujus puellae\" (Why did you enter the body  of this maiden?), said Barre.    \"Propter praesentiam tuum\" (Because of your presence), answered the  superior.    At this point the bailiff, seeing no reason why the dialogue between  Barre and the superior should ever come to an end, interposed and  demanded that questions suggested by him and the other officials present  should be put to the superior, promising that if she answered three of  four such questions correctly, he, and those with him, would believe in  the reality of the possession, and would certify to that effect. Barre  accepted the challenge, but unluckily just at that moment the superior  regained consciousness, and as it was already late, everyone retired.          CHAPTER VI      The next day, November 25th, the bailiff and the majority of the  officers of the two jurisdictions came to the convent once more, and  were all conducted to the choir. In a few moments the curtains behind  the grating were drawn back, and the superior, lying on her bed, came to  view. Barre began, as usual, by the celebration of mass, during which  the superior was seized with convulsions, and exclaimed two or three  times, \"Grandier! Grandier! false priest!\" When the mass was over, the  celebrant went behind the grating, carrying the pyx; then, placing it on  his head and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2747"],[0,"Nisida (#9)"],[1,"and upheld him in her arms. The young girl had understood  him; she assured him that she was well. Fearing to remind him of his  terrible position, she spoke volubly of all manner of things--her aunt,  the weather, the Madonna. Then she stopped suddenly, frightened at her  own words, frightened at her own silence; she fixed her burning gaze  upon her brother's brow as though to fascinate him. Little by little  animation returned to her; a faint colour tinted her hollowed cheeks,  and Gabriel, deceived by the maiden's super human efforts, thought her  still beautiful, and thanked God in his heart for having spared this  tender creature. Nisida, as though she had followed her brother's secret  thoughts, came close to him, pressed his hand with an air of  understanding, and murmured low in his ear, \"Fortunately our father has  been away for two days; he sent me word that he would be detained in  town. For us, it is different; we are young, we have courage!\"    The poor young girl was trembling like a leaf.    \"What will become of you, my poor Nisida?\"    \"Bah! I will pray to the Madonna. Does she not watch over us?\" The girl  stopped, struck by the sound of her own words, which the circumstances  so cruelly contradicted. But looking at her brother, she went on in a  low tone: \"Assuredly she does watch over us. She appeared to me last  night in a dream. She held her child Jesus on her arm, and looked at me  with a mother's tenderness. She wishes to make saints of us, for she  loves us; and to be a saint, you see, Gabriel, one must suffer.\"    \"Well, go and pray for me, my kind sister; go away from the view of this  sad place, which will eventually shake your firmness, and perhaps mine.  Go; we shall see each other again in heaven above, where our mother is  waiting for us--our mother whom you have not known, and to whom I shall  often speak of you. Farewell, my sister, until we meet again!\"    And he kissed her on the forehead.    The young girl called up all her strength into her heart for this  supreme moment; she walked with a firm step; having reached the  threshold, she turned round and waved him a farewell, preventing herself  by a nervous contraction from bursting into tears, but as soon as she  was in the corridor, a sob broke from her bosom, and Gabriel, who heard  it echo from the vaulted roof, thought that his heart would break.    Then he threw himself on his knees, and, lifting his hands to heaven,  cried, \"I have finished suffering; I have nothing more that holds me to  life. I thank Thee, my God! Thou hast kept my father away, and hast been  willing to spare the poor old man a grief that would have been beyond  his strength.\"    It was at the hour of noon, after having exhausted every possible means,  poured out his gold to the last piece, and embraced the knees of the  lowest serving man, that Solomon the fisherman took his way to his son's  prison. His brow was so woebegone that the guards drew back, seized with  pity, and the gaoler wept as he closed the door of the cell upon him.  The old man remained some moments without advancing a step, absorbed in  contemplation of his son. By the tawny gleam of his eye might be divined  that the soul of the man was moved at that instant by some dark project.  He seemed nevertheless struck by the-beauty of Gabriel's face. Three  months in prison had restored to his skin the whiteness that the sun had  turned brown; his fine dark hair fell in curls around his neck, his eyes  rested on his father with a liquid and brilliant gaze. Never had this  head been so beautiful as now, when it was to fall.    \"Alas, my poor son!\" said the old man, \"there is no hope left; you must  die.\"    \"I know it,\" answered Gabriel in a tone of tender reproach, \"and it is  not that which most afflicts me at this moment. But you, too, why do you  wish to give me pain, at your age? Why did you not stay in the town?\"    \"In the town,\" the old man returned, \"they have no pity; I cast myself  at the king's feet, at everybody's feet; there is no pardon, no mercy  for us.\"    \"Well, in God's name, what is death to me? I meet it daily on the sea.  My greatest, my only torment is the pain that they are causing you.\"    \"And I, do you think, my Gabriel, that I only suffer in seeing you die?  Oh, it is but a parting for a few days; I shall soon go to join you. But  a darker sorrow weighs upon me. I am strong, I am a man\". He stopped,  fearing that he had said too much; then drawing near to his son, he said  in a tearful voice, \"Forgive me, my Gabriel; I am the cause of your  death. I ought to have killed the prince with my own hand. In our  country, children and old men are not condemned to death. I am over  eighty years old; I should have been pardoned; they told me that when,  with tears, I asked pardon for you; once more, forgive me, Gabriel; I  thought my daughter was dead; I thought of nothing else; and besides, I  did not know the law.\"    \"Father, father!\" cried Gabriel, touched, \"what are you saying? I would  have given my life a thousand times over to purchase one day of yours.  Since you are strong enough to be present at my last hour, fear not; you  will not see me turn pale; your son will be worthy of you.\"    \"And he is to die, to die!\" cried Solomon, striking his forehead in  despair, and casting on the walls of the dungeon a look of fire that  would fain have pierced them.    \"I am resigned, father,\" said Gabriel gently; did not Christ ascend the  cross?\"    \"Yes,\" murmured the old man in a muffled voice, \"but He did not leave  behind a sister dishonoured by His death.\"    These words, which escaped the old fisherman in spite of himself, threw  a sudden and terrible light into the soul of Gabriel. For the first time  he perceived all the infamous manner of his death: the shameless  populace crowding round the scaffold, the hateful hand of the  executioner taking him by the Hair, and the drops of his blood  besprinkling the white raiment of his sister and covering her with  shame.    \"Oh, if I could get a weapon!\" cried Gabriel, his haggard eyes roaming  around.    \"It is not the weapon that is lacking,\" answered Solomon, carrying his  hand to the hilt of a dagger that he had hidden in his breast.    \"Then kill me, father,\" said Gabriel in a low tone, but with an  irresistible accent of persuasion and entreaty; \"oh yes, I confess it  now, the executioner's hand frightens me. My Nisida, my poor Nisida, I  have seen her; she was here just now, as beautiful and as pale as the  Madonna Dolorosa; she smiled to hide from me her sufferings. She was  happy, poor girl, because she believed you away. Oh, how sweet it will  be to me to die by your hand! You gave me life; take it back, father,  since God will have it so. And Nisida will be saved. Oh, do not  hesitate! It would be a cowardice on the part of both of us; she is my  sister, she is your daughter.\"    And seeing that his powerful will had subjugated the old man, he said,  \"Help! help, father!\" and offered his breast to the blow. The poor  father lifted his hand to strike; but a mortal convulsion ran through  all his limbs; he fell into his son's arms, and both burst into tears.    \"Poor father!\" said Gabriel. \"I ought to have foreseen that. Give me  that dagger and turn away; I am young and my arm will not tremble.\"    \"Oh no!\" returned Solomon solemnly, \"no, my son, for then you would be a  suicide! Let your soul ascend to heaven pure! God will give me His  strength. Moreover, we have time yet.\"    And a last ray of hope shone in the eyes of the fisherman.    Then there passed in that dungeon one of those scenes that words can  never reproduce. The poor father sat down on the straw at his son's side  and laid his head gently upon his knees. He smiled to him through his  tears, as one smiles to a sick child; he passed his hand slowly through  the silky curls of his hair, and asked him countless questions,  intermingled with caresses. In order to give him a distaste for this  world he kept on talking to him of the other. Then, with a sudden  change, he questioned him minutely about all sorts of past matters.  Sometimes he stopped in alarm, and counted the beatings of his heart,  which were hurriedly marking the passage of time.    \"Tell me everything, my child; have you any desire, any wish that could  be satisfied before you die? Are you leaving any woman whom you loved  secretly? Everything we have left shall be hers.\"    \"I regret nothing on earth but you and my sister. You are the only  persons whom I have loved since my mother's death.\"    \"Well, be comforted. Your sister will be saved.\"    \"Oh, yes! I shall die happy.\"    \"Do you forgive our enemies?\"    \"With all the strength of my heart. I pray God to have mercy on the  witnesses who accused me. May He forgive me my sins!\"    \"How old is it that you will soon be?\" the old man asked suddenly, for  his reason was beginning to totter, and his memory had failed him.    \"I was twenty-five on All Hallows' Day.\"    \"True; it was a sad day, this year; you were in prison.\"    \"Do you remember how, five years ago, on that same day I got the prize  in the regatta at Venice?\"    \"Tell me about that, my child.\"    And he listened, his neck stretched forward, his mouth half open, his  hands in his son's. A sound of steps came in from the corridor, and a  dull knock was struck upon the door. It was the fatal hour. The poor  father had forgotten it.    The priests had already begun to sing the death hymn; the executioner  was ready, the procession had set out, when Solomon the fisherman  appeared suddenly on the threshold of the prison, his eyes aflame and  his brow radiant with the halo of the patriarchs. The old man drew  himself up to his full height, and raising in one hand the reddened  knife, said in a sublime voice, \"The sacrifice is fulfilled. God did not  send His angel to stay the hand of Abraham.\"    The crowd carried him in triumph!    [The details of this case are"]]]
