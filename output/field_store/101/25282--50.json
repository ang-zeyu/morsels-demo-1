This eagle had carefully watched his body  and prevented other ravenous birds from touching it.    The chief got up and stood upon his feet, but he felt himself weak and  much exhausted. The blood upon his wound had stanched itself, and he  now bound it up. He possessed a knowledge of such roots as have  healing properties, and these he carefully sought in the woods. Having  found some, he pounded some of them between stones and applied them  externally. Others he chewed and swallowed. In a short time he found  himself so much recovered as to be able to commence his journey, but  he suffered greatly from hunger, not seeing any large animals that he  might kill. However, he succeeded in killing some small birds with his  bow and arrow, and these he roasted before a fire at night.    In this way he sustained himself until he came to a river that  separated his wife and friends from him. He stood upon the bank and  gave that peculiar whoop which is a signal of the return of a friend.  The sound was immediately heard, and a canoe was despatched to bring  him over, and in a short time, amidst the shouts of his friends and  relations, who thronged from every side to see the arrival, the  warrior-chief was landed.    When the first wild bursts of wonder and joy had subsided, and some  degree of quiet had been restored to the village, he related to his  people the account of his adventures. He concluded his narrative by  telling them that it is pleasing to the spirit of a deceased person to  have a fire built upon the grave for four nights after his burial;  that it is four days' journey to the land appointed for the residence  of the spirits; that in its journey thither the spirit stands in need  of a fire every night at the place of its encampment; and that if the  friends kindle this fire upon the spot where the body is laid, the  spirit has the benefit of its light and warmth on its path, while if  the friends neglect to do this, the spirit is subjected to the irksome  task of making its own fire each night.          THE LEGEND OF O-NA-WUT-A-QUT-O.      A long time ago there lived an aged Odjibwa and his wife on the shores  of Lake Huron. They had an only son, a very beautiful boy, named  O-na-wut-a-qut-o, or He that catches the clouds. The family were of  the totem of the beaver. The parents were very proud of their son, and  wished to make him a celebrated man; but when he reached the proper  age he would not submit to the We-koon-de-win, or fast. When this time  arrived they gave him charcoal instead of his breakfast, but he would  not blacken his face. If they denied him food he sought bird's eggs  along the shore, or picked up the heads of fish that had been cast  away, and broiled them. One day they took away violently the food he  had prepared, and cast him some coals in place of it. This act decided  him. He took the coals and blackened his face and went out of the  lodge. He did not return, but lay down without to sleep. As he lay, a  very beautiful girl came down from the clouds and stood by his side.    \"O-na-wut-a-qut-o,\" she said, \"I am come for you. Follow in my  footsteps.\"    The young man rose and did as he was bid. Presently he found himself  ascending above the tops of the trees, and gradually he mounted up  step by step into the air, and through the clouds. At length his guide  led him through an opening, and he found himself standing with her on  a beautiful plain.    A path led to a splendid lodge, into which O-na-wut-a-qut-o followed  his guide. It was large, and divided into two parts. At one end he saw  bows and arrows, clubs and spears, and various warlike instruments  tipped with silver. At the other end were things exclusively belonging  to women. This was the house of his fair guide, and he saw that she  had on a frame a broad rich belt of many colours that she was weaving.    \"My brother is coming,\" she said, \"and I must hide you.\"    Putting him in one corner she spread the belt over him, and presently  the brother came in very richly dressed, and shining as if he had  points of silver all over him. He took down from the wall a splendid  pipe, and a bag in which was a-pa-ko-ze-gun, or smoking mixture. When  he had finished smoking, he laid his pipe aside, and said to his  sister--    \"Nemissa,\" (elder sister) \"when will you quit these practices? Do you  forget that the greatest of the spirits has commanded that you shall  not take away the children from below? Perhaps you think you have  concealed O-na-wut-a-qut-o, but do I not know of his coming? If you  would not offend me, send him back at once.\"    These words did not, however, alter his sister's purpose. She would  not send him back, and her brother, finding that she was determined,  called O-na-wut-a-qut-o from his hiding-place.    \"Come out of your concealment,\" said he, \"and walk about and amuse  yourself. You will grow hungry if you remain there.\"    At these words O-na-wut-a-qut-o came forth from under the belt, and  the brother presented a bow and arrows, with a pipe of red stone,  richly ornamented, to him. In this way he gave his consent to  O-na-wut-a-qut-o's marriage with his sister, and from that time the  youth and the girl became husband and wife.    O-na-wut-a-qut-o found everything exceedingly fair and beautiful  around him, but he found no other people besides his wife and her  brother. There were flowers on the plains, there were bright and  sparkling streams, there were green valleys and pleasant trees, there  were gay birds and beautiful animals, very different from those he had  been accustomed to. There was also day and night as on the earth, but  he observed that every morning the brother regularly left the lodge  and remained absent all day, and every evening his sister departed,  but generally for only a part of the night.    O-na-wut-a-qut-o was curious to solve this mystery, and obtained the  brother's consent to accompany him in one of his daily journeys. They  travelled over a smooth plain which seemed to stretch to illimitable  distances all around. At length O-na-wut-a-qut-o felt the gnawings of  hunger and asked his companion if there was no game about.    \"Patience, my brother,\" replied he; \"we shall soon reach the spot  where I eat my dinner, and you will then see how I am provided.\"    After walking on a long time they came to a place where several fine  mats were spread, and there they sat down to refresh themselves. At  this place there was a hole in the sky and O-na-wut-a-qut-o, at his  companion's request, looked through it down upon the earth. He saw  below the great lakes and the villages of the Indians. In one place he  saw a war-party stealing on the camp of their enemies. In another he  saw feasting and dancing. On a green plain some young men were playing  at ball, and along the banks of a stream were women employed in  gathering the a-puk-wa for mats.    \"Do you see,\" asked the brother, \"that group of children playing  beside a lodge? Observe that beautiful and active lad,\" said he, at  the same time darting something from his hand. The child immediately  fell on the ground, and was carried by his companions into the lodge.    O-na-wut-a-qut-o and his companion watched and saw the people below  gathering about the lodge. They listened to the she-she-gwau of the  meeta, to the song he sang asking that the child's life might be  spared. To this request O-na-wut-a-qut-o's companion made answer--    \"Send me up the sacrifice of a white dog.\"    A feast was immediately ordered by the parents of the child. The  white dog was killed, his carcass was roasted, all the wise men and  medicine-men of the village assembling to witness the ceremony.    \"There are many below,\" said O-na-wut-a-qut-o's companion, \"whom you  call great in medical skill. They are so, because their ears are open;  and they are able to succeed, because when I call they hear my voice.  When I have struck one with sickness they direct the people to look to  me, and when they make me the offering I ask, I remove my hand from  off the sick person and he becomes well.\"    While he was saying this, the feast below had been served. Then the  master of the feast said--    \"We send this to thee, Great Manito,\" and immediately the roasted  animal came up. Thus O-na-wut-a-qut-o and his companion got their  dinner, and after they had eaten they returned to the lodge by a  different path.    In this manner they lived for some time, but at last the youth got  weary of the life. He thought of his friends, and wished to go back to  them. He could not forget his native village and his father's lodge,  and he asked his wife's permission to return. After some persuasion  she consented.    \"Since you are better pleased,\" she said, \"with the cares and ills and  poverty of the world, than with the peaceful delights of the sky and  its boundless prairies, go. I give you my permission, and since I have  brought you hither I will conduct you back. Remember, however, that  you are still my husband. I hold a chain in my hand by which I can,  whenever I will, draw you back to me. My power over you will be in no  way diminished. Beware, therefore, how you venture to take a wife  among the people below. Should you ever do so, you will feel what a  grievous thing it is to arouse my anger.\"    As she uttered these words her eyes sparkled, and she drew herself up  with a majestic air. In the same moment O-na-wut-a-qut-o awoke. He  found himself on the ground near his father's lodge, on the very spot  where he had thrown himself down to sleep. Instead of the brighter  beings of a higher world, he found around him his parents and their  friends. His mother told him that he had been absent a year. For some  time O-na-wut-a-qut-o remained gloomy and silent, but by degrees he  recovered his spirits, and he began to doubt the reality of all he had  seen and heard above. At last he even"]]]
