The centre, or oldest teeth show the marks of age first, and often  become somewhat worn before the corner teeth appear. At eight weeks, the  four inner teeth are nearly as sharp as before. They appear worn not so  much on the outer edge or line of the tooth, as inside this line; but,  after this, the edge begins gradually to lose its sharpness, and to  present a more flattened surface; while the next outer teeth wear down  like the four central ones; and at three months this wearing off is very  apparent, till at four months all the incisor teeth appear worn, but the  inner ones the most. Now the teeth begin slowly to diminish in size by  a kind of contraction, as well as wearing down, and the distance apart  becomes more and more apparent.    [Illustration: EIGHTEEN MONTHS.]    From the fifth to the eighth month, the inner teeth will usually appear  as in the cut of the teeth at that time; and at ten months, this change  shows more clearly, as represented in the next cut; and the spaces  between them begin to show very plainly, till at a year old they  ordinarily present the appearance of the following cut; and at the age  of fifteen months, that shown in the next, where the corner teeth are  not more than half the original size, and the centre ones still smaller.    [Illustration: TWO YEARS PAST.]    The permanent teeth are now rapidly growing, and preparing to take the  place of the milk-teeth, which are gradually absorbed till they  disappear, or are pushed out to give place to the two permanent central  incisors, which at a year and a half will generally present the  appearance indicated in the cut, which shows the internal structure of  the lower jaw at this time, with the cells of the teeth, the two central  ones protruding into the mouth, the next two pushing up, but not quite  grown to the surface, with the third pair just perceptible. These  changes require time; and at two years past the jaw will usually appear  as in the cut, where four of the permanent central incisors are seen.  After this, the other milk-teeth decrease rapidly, but are slow to  disappear; and at three years old, the third pair of permanent teeth are  but formed, as represented in the cut; and at four years the last pair  of incisors will be up, as in the cut of that age; but the outside ones  are not yet fully grown, and the beast can hardly be said to be  full-mouthed till the age of five years. But before this age, or at the  age of four years, the two inner pairs of permanent teeth are beginning  to wear at the edges, as shown in the cut; while at five years old the  whole set becomes somewhat worn down at the top, and on the two centre  ones a darker line appears in the middle, along a line of harder bone,  as appears in the appropriate cut.    [Illustration: THREE YEARS PAST.]    [Illustration: FOUR YEARS PAST.]    [Illustration: FIVE YEARS PAST.]    [Illustration: TEN YEARS PAST.]    Now will come a year or two, and sometimes three, when the teeth do not  so clearly indicate the exact age, and the judgment must be guided by  the extent to which the dark middle lines are worn. This will depend  somewhat upon the exposure and feeding of the animal; but at seven years  these lines extend over all the teeth. At eight years, another change  begins, which cannot be mistaken. A kind of absorption begins with the  two central incisors--slow at first, but perceptible--and these two  teeth become smaller than the rest, while the dark lines are worn into  one in all but the corner teeth, till, at ten years, four of the central  incisors have become smaller in size, with a smaller and fainter mark,  as indicated in the proper cut. At eleven, the six inner teeth are  smaller than the corner ones; and at twelve, all become smaller than  they were, while the dark lines are nearly gone, except in the corner  teeth, and the inner edge is worn to the gum.      POINTS OF A GOOD COW.    After satisfaction is afforded touching the age of a cow, she should be  examined with reference to her soundness of constitution. A good  constitution is indicated by large lungs, which are found in a deep,  broad, and prominent chest, broad and well-spread ribs, a respiration  somewhat slow and regular, a good appetite, and if in milk a strong  inclination to drink, which a large secretion of milk almost invariably  stimulates. In such a cow the digestive organs are active and energetic,  and they make an abundance of good blood, which in turn stimulates the  activity of the nervous system, and furnishes the milky glands with the  means of abundant secretion. Such a cow, when dry, readily takes on fat.  When activity of the milk-glands is found united with close ribs, small  and feeble lungs, and a slow appetite, often attended by great thirst,  the cow will generally possess only a weak and feeble constitution; and  if the milk is plentiful, it will generally be of bad quality, while the  animal, if she does not die of diseased lungs, will not readily take on  fat, when dry and fed.    [Illustration: A GOOD MILCH COW.]    In order to have no superfluous flesh, the cow should have a small,  clean, and rather long head, tapering toward the muzzle. A cow with a  large, coarse head will seldom fatten readily, or give a large quantity  of milk. A coarse head increases the proportion of weight of the least  valuable parts, while it is a sure indication that the whole bony  structure is too heavy. The mouth should be large and broad; the eye  bright and sparkling, but of a peculiar placidness of expression, with  no indication of wildness, but rather a mild and feminine look. These  points will indicate gentleness of disposition. Such cows seem to like  to be milked, are fond of being caressed, and often return caresses. The  horns should be small, short, tapering, yellowish, and glistening. The  neck should be small, thin, and tapering toward the head, but thickening  when it approaches the shoulder; the dewlaps small. The fore quarters  should be rather small when compared with the hind quarters. The form of  the barrel will be large, and each rib should project further than the  preceding one, up to the loins. She should be well formed across the  hips and in the rump.    The spine or back-bone should be straight and long, rather loosely hung,  or open along the middle part, the result of the distance between the  dorsal vertebrae, which sometimes causes a slight depression, or sway  back. By some good judges, this mark is regarded as of great importance,  especially when the bones of the hind quarters are also rather loosely  put together, leaving the rump of great width and the pelvis large, and  the organs and milk-vessels lodged in the cavities largely developed.  The skin over the rump should be loose and flexible. This point is of  great importance; and as, when the cow is in low condition or very poor,  it will appear somewhat harder and closer than it otherwise would, some  practice and close observation are required to judge well of this mark.  The skin, indeed, all over the body, should be soft and mellow to the  touch, with soft and glossy hair. The tail, if thick at the setting on,  should taper and be fine below.    But the udder is of special importance. It should be large in  proportion to the size of the animal, and the skin thin, with soft,  loose folds extending well back, capable of great distension when  filled, but shrinking to a small compass when entirely empty. It must be  free from lumps in every part, and provided with four teats set well  apart, and of medium size. Nor is it less important to observe the  milk-veins carefully. The principal ones under the belly should be large  and prominent, and extend forward to the navel, losing themselves,  apparently, in the very best milkers, in a large cavity in the flesh,  into which the end of the finger can be inserted; but when the cow is  not in full milk, the milk-vein, at other times very prominent, is not  so distinctly traced; and hence, to judge of its size when the cow is  dry, or nearly so, this vein may be pressed near its end, or at its  entrance into the body, when it will immediately fill up to its full  size. This vein does not convey the milk to the udder, as some suppose,  but is the channel by which the blood returns; and its contents consist  of the refuse of the secretion, or of what has not been taken up in  forming milk. There are also veins in the udder, and the perineum, or  the space above the udder, and between that and the buttocks, which it  is of special importance to observe. These veins should be largely  developed, and irregular or knotted, especially those of the udder. They  are largest in great milkers.    The knotted veins of the perineum, extending from above downwards in a  winding line, are not readily seen in young heifers, and are very  difficult to find in poor cows, or those of only a medium quality. They  are easily found in very good milkers, and if not at first apparent,  they are made so by pressing upon them at the base of the perineum,  when they swell up and send the blood back toward the vulva. They form  a kind of thick network under the skin of the perineum, raising it up  somewhat, in some cases near the vulva, in others nearer down and closer  to the udder. It is important to look for these veins, as they often  form a very important guide, and by some they would be considered as  furnishing the surest indications of the milking qualities of the cow.  Full development almost always shows an abundant secretion of milk; but  they are far better developed after the cow has had two or three calves,  when two or three years' milking has given full activity to the milky  glands, and attracted a large flow of blood. The larger and more  prominent these veins the better. It is needless to say that in  observing them some regard should be had to the condition"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#9)"],[1,"this view  was only the outgrowth of the strong interest which physiology took in  the sense processes. If a neutral fair account of the brain actions is  attempted, there can hardly be doubt that this whole sensorial view of  the brain is only half of the story and that the motor half has exactly  the same right to consideration. The cortex of the brain, the functions  of which are accompanied by mental processes, is always and everywhere  not only the recipient of sensory stimuli but at the same time the  starting point of motor impulses. That which is centripetal, leading to  the cortex, is therefore not more important for the central process than  that which is centrifugal, leading from the cortex. The cortex is the  apparatus of transmission between the incoming and the outgoing  currents, between the excitements which run to the brain and the  discharges which go from the brain, and the mental accompaniments are  thus accompaniments of these transmission processes. If the channels of  discharge are closed and the transmission is thus impossible, a blockade  must result at the central station and the accompanying mental processes  must be entirely different from those which happen there when the  channels of discharge are wide open. Here too all the special theories  are still in the midst of tumultuous discord. Yet this new emphasis on  the motor side of the psychical process seems to influence modern  psychology more and more.    Nobody can deny that first of all this is the necessary outcome of a  biological view of the brain. What else can be the brain's function in  the midst of nature than the transforming of impressions into  expressions, stimuli into actions? It is the great apparatus by which  the organism steadily adjusts itself to the surroundings. There would be  no use whatever biologically in a brain which had connections with the  sense organs, but which had no connections with the muscular system, and  on the other hand, a brain which had motor nerves and muscular  adjustment would be entirely useless if it had not sensory nerves and  sense organs connected with it. In the one case the world would be  experienced, but no response would be possible; in the other case, the  means for response would be given, but no adjustment could set in  because no experience of the surroundings would be possible. Adjustment  every moment demands the relation of the brain in both directions.  Through the sensory nerves the brain receives; through the motor nerves  the brain directs, and this whole arc from the sense organs through the  sensory nerves, through the brain, through the motor nerves and finally  to the muscles, is one unified apparatus of which no part can be thought  away. The brain in itself would be just as useless for the organism as  the heart would be without the arteries and veins.    We must keep this intimate and necessary relation between the sensory  and motor parts constantly in view, and must understand that there  cannot be any sensory process which does not go over into motor  response. Then only the ways are open to develop physiological views  which give a physical basis to the processes of attention and vividness  and inhibition, just as well as to the processes of memory and  association. Such motor theories take many forms. Perhaps we shall most  quickly bring the most essential factors together, if we say that full  vividness belongs only to those sensations for which the channels of  motor discharge are open, while those are inhibited for which the  channels of discharge are closed; and any channel of discharge is  closed, if action is proceeding in the opposite channel. If I open my  hand, the motor paths which lead to closing my fist are blocked; and if  I close my fist, the channels which lead to the opening of the hand are  closed. Now if only those ideas are vivid which find the channels open,  it is clear that all the ideas which would lead to the opposite action  have no chance for development; they remain inhibited, and just this  relation between the vividness of certain ideas and inhibition for those  ideas which lead to the opposite action is the characteristic of the  process of attention.    From such a point of view, the total mental life can be brought into the  psychophysical scheme. We now have not two variable factors, but three,  namely, the qualities of the elements, the intensities of the elements,  and, as a third, the vividness of the elements. The quality corresponds,  as we saw in the association theory, to the local position and  connection of the brain cells; the intensity corresponds to the energy  of the excitement; and the vividness, we may add now, corresponds to the  relation to motor channels. The whole mental life thus becomes the  accompaniment of a steady process of transmitting impressions and  memories into reactions. That every experience involves millions of such  elements we saw when we spoke of the description of mental life. The  effort to explain mental life shows us now that this millionfold  manifoldness belongs to a system of reactions of which all parts are in  steady correlation: a moving equilibrium of unlimited complexity. Surely  no one can reduce this wonderful manifoldness to those clumsy concepts  with which popular psychology is reporting the story of the mind and its  relations to the brain.    It may seem that such a psychological view of inner life annihilates  that which we feel as the most essential characteristic of our inner  experience, its unity and its freedom. In one sense that is certainly  true. In the real life which we live and fight through, where our duties  and our happiness lie, we know a unity and freedom of our personality  which psychology must destroy. Of course that does not mean that  psychology denies the truth of that freedom and unity. Moreover it would  condemn itself if it were to deny that which gives meaning to the  endeavors of our life and thus also to every search for truth.  Psychology claims only that we must abstract from it, when we take the  psychological standpoint towards life. Freedom of our real life means  that we must know ourselves in the midst of our life work as guided by  aims and obligations, and that in this purposive existence of ourselves  we do not feel ourselves as determined by causes. I will the fulfillment  of my ideals only because I will them. That this will itself may be the  effect of foregoing causes is an aspect which does not belong to my  naive experience. Our freedom means that in our real life our will is  not related to causes, that the point of view of causality is thus  meaningless for the value of our achievements. And the other man's will  too comes in question for us as something to be interpreted and to be  appreciated, but not to be explained by connection with causes. As long  as we move in this sphere of purposive interest, we are free and deal  with free selves; but if in the midst of these free aims, the will  arises to consider the actions of others and of ourselves from the  standpoint of causality, then we have ourselves decided to enter a new  sphere in which it would be meaningless to seek for any will which is  not determined by causes. As soon as we have chosen the psychological  standpoint and are in the midst of the work of causal reconstruction,  any will which is not understood as determined by causes is simply an  unsolved problem. In the midst of a causal construction, absence of  causes would never mean real freedom.    In that purposive world of immediate life experience, we also are  unities inasmuch as we ourselves know us as the same in every new will  of ours. We remain identical with ourselves because every purpose is  posited in the midst of, and bound up with, the general purpose of  ourselves. And in this internal unity of meaning, nothing breaks  ourselves into pieces, and the whole manifold of experience is thus  expressed by a personality which knows itself in its purposive unity.  But this unity again is denied by our own intention as soon as we decide  to take the causal view of inner life. The purposive unity must now  transform itself into an endless complexity, and our own self becomes a  composite of hundreds of thousands of elements.    On the other hand, all this does not mean that psychology cannot have  its own consistent conception of the mind's unity and freedom. Our  psychological mind is a unity because its manifold is a system in which  all parts hang together. A change in any one part involves changes in  the whole system. The interrelation, to be sure, is not a strictly  psychical one, for we have seen that the causal connection as such  appears at the physical side. But, inasmuch as there is no psychical  process which does not belong to a physiological one, the  interconnection of the mental facts is complete and involves the  totality of neural processes of which after all a small part only has  its psychological record. We might compare those hundreds of millions of  neurons in each brain with the hundreds of millions of individuals who  make up the population of the nations, and the psychical accompaniment  we might compare with the written historical record of mankind. The  written records themselves have no direct interconnection, they are only  accompaniments of what happens in these millions of men. And again only  the higher layer of the neurons in the population sees its doings  recorded in the annals of history; and yet whatever those leaders of  action and thought and emotion may achieve is dependent upon and working  on the actions of those millions of subcortical population neurons. The  historical record has its unity through the interrelation of all parts  of historical mankind.    But after all the psychologist has no less a right to speak of freedom.  Of course his freedom cannot mean exemption from causality. Whatever  happens in the psychological system must be perfectly "]]]
