They set a new inquiry on foot, which, instead of  producing enlightenment, only plunged them into still greater obscurity.  Out of thirty witnesses heard, more than three-quarters agreed in  identifying as Martin Guerre the man who claimed his name. Never was  greater perplexity caused by more extraordinary appearances. The  remarkable resemblance upset all reasoning: some recognised him as  Arnauld du Thill, and others asserted the exact contrary. He could  hardly understand Basque, some said, though born in Biscay, was that  astonishing, seeing he was only three when he left the country? He could  neither wrestle nor fence well, but having no occasion to practise these  exercises he might well have forgotten them. The shoemaker--who made his  shoes afore-time, thought he took another measure, but he might have  made a mistake before or be mistaken now. The prisoner further defended  himself by recapitulating the circumstances of his first meeting with  Bertrande, on his return, the thousand and one little details he had  mentioned which he only could have known, also the letters in his  possession, all of which could only be explained by the assumption that  he was the veritable Martin Guerre. Was it likely that he would be  wounded over the left eye and leg as the missing man was supposed to be?  Was it likely that the old servant, that the four sisters, his uncle  Pierre, many persons to whom he had related facts known only to himself,  that all the community in short, would have recognised him? And even the  very intrigue suspected by Bertrande, which had aroused her jealous  anger, this very intrigue, if it really existed, was it not another  proof of the verity of his claim, since the person concerned, as  interested and as penetrating as the legitimate wife; had also accepted  him as her former lover? Surely here was a mass of evidence sufficient  to cast light on the case. Imagine an impostor arriving for the first  time in a place where all the inhabitants are unknown to him, and  attempting to personate a man who had dwelt there, who would have  connections of all kinds, who would have played his part in a thousand  different scenes, who would have confided his secrets, his opinions, to  relations, friends, acquaintances, to all sorts of people; who had also  a wife--that is to say, a person under whose eyes nearly his whole life  would be passed, a person would study him perpetually, with whom he  would be continually conversing on every sort of subject. Could such an  impostor sustain his impersonation for a single day, without his memory  playing him false? From the physical and moral impossibility of playing  such a part, was it not reasonable to conclude that the accused, who had  maintained it for more than two years, was the true Martin Guerre?    There seemed, in fact, to be nothing which could account for such an  attempt being successfully made unless recourse was had to an accusation  of sorcery. The idea of handing him over to the ecclesiastical  authorities was briefly discussed, but proofs were necessary, and the  judges hesitated. It is a principle of justice, which has become a  precept in law, that in cases of uncertainty the accused has the benefit  of the doubt; but at the period of which we are writing, these truths  were far from being acknowledged; guilt was presumed rather than  innocence; and torture, instituted to force confession from those who  could not otherwise be convicted, is only explicable by supposing the  judges convinced of the actual guilt of the accused; for no one would  have thought of subjecting a possibly innocent person to this suffering.  However, notwithstanding this prejudice, which has been handed down to  us by some organs of the public ministry always disposed to assume the  guilt of a suspected person,--notwithstanding this prejudice, the judges  in this case neither ventured to condemn Martin Guerre themselves as an  impostor, nor to demand the intervention of the Church. In this conflict  of contrary testimony, which seemed to reveal the truth only to  immediately obscure it again, in this chaos of arguments and conjectures  which showed flashes of light only to extinguish them in greater  darkness, consideration for the family prevailed. The sincerity of  Bertrande, the future of the children, seemed reasons for proceeding  with extreme caution, and this once admitted, could only yield to  conclusive evidence. Consequently the Parliament adjourned the case,  matters remaining in 'statu quo', pending a more exhaustive inquiry.  Meanwhile, the accused, for whom several relations and friends gave  surety, was allowed to be at liberty at Artigues, though remaining under  careful surveillance.    Bertrande therefore again saw him an inmate of the house, as if no  doubts had ever been cast on the legitimacy of their union. What  thoughts passed through her mind during the long 'tete-a-tete'? She had  accused this man of imposture, and now, notwithstanding her secret  conviction, she was obliged to appear as if she had no suspicion, as if  she had been mistaken, to humiliate herself before the impostor, and ask  forgiveness for the insanity of her conduct; for, having publicly  renounced her accusation by refusing to swear to it, she had no  alternative left. In order to sustain her part and to save the honour of  her children, she must treat this man as her husband and appear  submissive and repentant; she must show him entire confidence, as the  only means of rehabilitating him and lulling the vigilance of justice.  What the widow of Martin Guerre must have suffered in this life of  effort was a secret between God and herself, but she looked at her  little daughter, she thought of her fast approaching confinement, and  took courage.    One evening, towards nightfall, she was sitting near him in the most  private corner of the garden, with her little child on her knee, whilst  the adventurer, sunk in gloomy thoughts, absently stroked Sanxi's fair  head. Both were silent, for at the bottom of their hearts each knew the  other's thoughts, and, no longer able to talk familiarly, nor daring to  appear estranged, they spent, when alone together, long hours of silent  dreariness.    All at once a loud uproar broke the silence of their retreat; they heard  the exclamations of many persons, cries of surprise mixed with angry  tones, hasty footsteps, then the garden gate was flung violently open,  and old Marguerite appeared, pale, gasping, almost breathless. Bertrande  hastened towards her in astonishment, followed by her husband, but when  near enough to speak she could only answer with inarticulate sounds,  pointing with terror to the courtyard of the house. They looked in this  direction, and saw a man standing at the threshold; they approached him.  He stepped forward, as if to place himself between them. He was tall,  dark; his clothes were torn; he had a wooden leg; his countenance was  stern. He surveyed Bertrande with a gloomy look: she cried aloud, and  fell back insensible; . . . she recognised her real husband!    Arnauld du Thill stood petrified. While Marguerite, distracted herself,  endeavoured to revive her mistress, the neighbours, attracted by the  noise, invaded the house, and stopped, gazing with stupefaction at this  astonishing resemblance. The two men had the same features, the same  height, the same bearing, and suggested one being in two persons. They  gazed at each other in terror, and in that superstitious age the idea of  sorcery and of infernal intervention naturally occurred to those  present. All crossed themselves, expecting every moment to see fire from  heaven strike one or other of the two men, or that the earth would  engulf one of them. Nothing happened, however, except that both were  promptly arrested, in order that the strange mystery might be cleared  up.    The wearer of the wooden leg, interrogated by the judges, related that  he came from Spain, where first the healing of his wound, and then the  want of money, had detained him hitherto. He had travelled on foot,  almost a beggar. He gave exactly the same reasons for leaving Artigues  as had been given by the other Martin Guerre, namely, a domestic quarrel  caused by jealous suspicion, the desire of seeing other countries, and  an adventurous disposition. He had gone back to his birthplace, in  Biscay; thence he entered the service of the Cardinal of Burgos; then  the cardinal's brother had taken him to the war, and he had served with  the Spanish troops; at the battle of St. Quentiny--his leg had been  shattered by an arquebus ball. So far his recital was the counterpart of  the one already heard by the judges from the other man. Now, they began  to differ. Martin Guerre stated that he had been conveyed to a house by  a man whose features he did not distinguish, that he thought he was  dying, and that several hours elapsed of which he could give no account,  being probably delirious; that he suffered later intolerable pain, and  on coming to himself, found that his leg had been amputated. He remained  long between life and death, but he was cared for by peasants who  probably saved his life; his recovery was very slow. He discovered that  in the interval between being struck down in the battle and recovering  his senses, his papers had disappeared, but it was impossible to suspect  the people who had nursed him with such generous kindness of theft.  After his recovery, being absolutely destitute, he sought to return to  France and again see his wife and child: he had endured all sorts of  privations and fatigues, and at length, exhausted, but rejoicing at  being near the end of his troubles, he arrived, suspecting nothing, at  his own door. Then the terror of the old servant, a few broken words,  made him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2753"],[0,"Ali Pacha (#9)"],[1," as her brother, could not contain her  delight at the idea of governing in the name of her son, who was weak  and gentle in character and accustomed to obey her implicitly. She asked  her brother's permission to go to Trikala to be present at the  installation, and obtained it, to everybody's astonishment; for no one  could imagine that Ali would peacefully renounce so important a  government as that of Thessaly. However, he dissembled so skilfully that  everyone was deceived by his apparent resignation, and applauded his  magnanimity, when he provided his sister with a brilliant escort to  conduct her to the capital of the province of which he had just been  deprived in favour of his nephew. He sent letters of congratulation to  the latter as well as magnificent presents, among them a splendid  pelisse of black fox, which had cost more than a hundred thousand francs  of Western money. He requested Elmas Bey to honour him by wearing this  robe on the day when the sultan's envoy should present him with the  firman of investiture, and Chainitza herself was charged to deliver both  gifts and messages.    Chainitza arrived safely at Trikala, and faithfully delivered the  messages with which she had been entrusted. When the ceremony she so  ardently desired took place, she herself took charge of all the  arrangements. Elmas, wearing the black fox pelisse, was proclaimed, and  acknowledged as Governor of Thessaly in her presence. \"My son is pacha!\"  she cried in the delirium of joy. \"My son is pacha! and my nephews will  die of envy!\" But her triumph was not to be of long duration. A few days  after his installation, Elmas began to feel strangely languid. Continual  lethargy, convulsive sneezing, feverish eyes, soon betokened a serious  illness. Ali's gift had accomplished its purpose. The pelisse, carefully  impregnated with smallpox germs taken from a young girl suffering from  this malady, had conveyed the dreaded disease to the new pacha, who, not  having been inoculated, died in a few days.    The grief of Chainitza at her son's death displayed itself in sobs,  threats, and curses, but, not knowing whom to blame for her misfortune,  she hastened to leave the scene of it, and returned to Janina, to mingle  her tears with those of her brother. She found Ali apparently in such  depths of grief, that instead of suspecting, she was actually tempted to  pity him, and this seeming sympathy soothed her distress, aided by the  caresses of her second son, Aden Bey. Ali, thoughtful of his own  interests, took care to send one of his own officers to Trikala, to  administer justice in the place of his deceased nephew, and the Porte,  seeing that all attempts against him only caused misfortune, consented  to his resuming the government of Thessaly.    This climax roused the suspicions of many persons. But the public voice,  already discussing the causes of the death of Elinas, was stifled by the  thunder of the cannon, which, from the ramparts of Janina, announced to  Epirus the birth of another son to Ali, Salik Bey, whose mother was a  Georgian slave.    Fortune, seemingly always ready both to crown Ali's crimes with success  and to fulfil his wishes, had yet in reserve a more precious gift than  any of the others, that of a good and beautiful wife; who should  replace, and even efface the memory of the beloved Emineh.    The Porte, while sending to Ali the firman which restored to him the  government of Thessaly, ordered him to seek out and destroy a society of  coiners who dwelt within his jurisdiction. Ali, delighted to, prove his  zeal by a service which cost nothing but bloodshed; at once set his  spies to work, and having discovered the abode of the gang, set out for  the place attended by a strong escort. It was a village called  Plikivitza.    Having arrived in the evening, he spent the night in taking measures to  prevent escape, and at break of day attacked the village suddenly with  his whole force. The coiners were seized in the act. Ali immediately  ordered the chief to be hung at his own door and the whole population to  be massacred. Suddenly a young girl of great beauty made her way through  the tumult and sought refuge at his feet. Ali, astonished, asked who she  was. She answered with a look of mingled innocence and terror, kissing  his hands, which she bathed with tears, and said:    \"O my lord! I implore thee to intercede with the terrible vizier Ali for  my mother and brothers. My father is dead, behold where he hangs at the  door of our cottage! But we have done nothing to rouse the anger of our  dreadful master. My mother is a poor woman who never offended anyone,  and we are only weak children. Save us from him!\"    Touched in spite of himself, the pacha took the girl in his arms, and  answered her with a gentle smile.    \"Thou hast come to the wrong man, child: I am this terrible vizier.\"    \"Oh no, no! you are good, you will be our good lord.\"    \"Well, be comforted, my child, and show me thy mother and thy brothers;  they shall be spared. Thou hast saved their lives.\"    And as she knelt at his feet, overcome with joy, he raised her and asked  her name.    \"Basilessa,\" she replied.    \"Basilessa, Queen! it is a name of good augury. Basilessa, thou shalt  dwell with me henceforth.\"    And he collected the members of her family, and gave orders for them to  be sent to Janina in company with the maiden, who repaid his mercy with  boundless love and devotion.    Let us mention one trait of gratitude shown by Ali at the end of this  expedition, and his record of good deeds is then closed. Compelled by a  storm to take refuge in a miserable hamlet, he inquired its name, and on  hearing it appeared surprised and thoughtful, as if trying to recall  lost memories. Suddenly he asked if a woman named Nouza dwelt in the  village, and was told there was an old infirm woman of that name in  great poverty. He ordered her to be brought before him. She came and  prostrated herself in terror. Ali raised her kindly.    \"Dost thou not know me?\" he asked.    \"Have mercy, great Vizier,\" answered the poor woman, who, having nothing  to lose but her life, imagined that even that would be taken from her.    \"I see,\" said the pacha, \"that if thou knowest me, thou dost not really  recognise me.\"    The woman looked at him wonderingly, not understanding his words in the  least.    \"Dost thou remember,\" continued Ali, \"that forty years ago a young man  asked for shelter from the foes who pursued him? Without inquiring his  name or standing, thou didst hide him in thy humble house, and dressed  his wounds, and shared thy scanty food with him, and when he was able to  go forward thou didst stand on thy threshold to wish him good luck and  success. Thy wishes were heard, for the young man was Ali Tepeleni, and  I who speak am he!\"    The old woman stood overwhelmed with astonishment. She departed calling  down blessings on the pasha, who assured her a pension of fifteen  hundred francs for the rest of her days.    But these two good actions are only flashes of light illuminating the  dark horizon of Ali's life for a brief moment. Returned to Janina, he  resumed his tyranny, his intrigues, and cruelty. Not content with the  vast territory which owned his sway, he again invaded that of his  neighbours on every pretext. Phocis, Mtolia, Acarnania, were by turns  occupied by his troops, the country ravaged, and the inhabitants  decimated. At the same time he compelled Ibrahim Pacha to surrender his  last remaining daughter, and give her in marriage to his nephew, Aden  Bey, the son of Chainitza. This new alliance with a family he had so  often attacked and despoiled gave him fresh arms against it, whether by  being enabled better to watch the pasha's sons, or to entice them into  some snare with greater ease.    Whilst he thus married his nephew, he did not neglect the advancement of  his sons. By the aid of the French Ambassador, whom he had convinced of  his devotion to the Emperor Napoleon, he succeeded in getting the  pachalik of Morea bestowed on Veli, and that of Lepanto on Mouktar. But  as in placing his sons in these exalted positions his only aim was to  aggrandise and consolidate his own power, he himself ordered their  retinues, giving them officers of his own choosing. When they departed  to their governments, he kept their wives, their children, and even  their furniture as pledges, saying that they ought not to be encumbered  with domestic establishments in time of war, Turkey just then being at  open war with England. He also made use of this opportunity to get rid  of people who displeased him, among others, of a certain Ismail Pacho  Bey, who had been alternately both tool and enemy, whom he made  secretary to his son Veli, professedly as a pledge of reconciliation and  favour, but really in order to despoil him more easily of the  considerable property which he possessed at Janina. Pacho was not  deceived, and showed his resentment openly. \"The wretch banishes me,\" he  cried, pointing out Ali, who was sitting at a window in the palace, \"he  sends me away in order to rob me; but I will avenge myself whatever  happens, and I shall die content if I can procure his destruction at the  price of my own.\"    Continually increasing his power, Ali endeavoured to consolidate it  permanently. He had entered by degrees into secret negotiations with all  the great powers of Europe, hoping in the end to make himself  independent, and to obtain recognition as Prince of Greece. A mysterious  and unforeseen incident betrayed this to the Porte, and furnished actual  proofs of his treason in letters confirmed by Ali's own seal. The Sultan  Selim immediately, sent to Janina a \"kapidgi-bachi,\" or plenipotentiary,  to examine into the case and try the delinquent.    Arrived at Janina, this officer placed before Ali the proofs of his  understanding with the enemies of the State. Ali was not strong enough  to throw off the mask, and"]]]
