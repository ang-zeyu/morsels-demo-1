So fully did the  tribunal in its wisdom recognise the importance of securing the sanctity  of a sacrament that is indispensable to salvation.    THIRD CASE    An Armenian woman had inspired a violent passion in a young Turkish  gentleman, but her prudence was long an obstacle to her lover's desires.  At last he went beyond all bounds, and threatened to kill both her and  her husband if she refused to gratify him. Frightened by this threat,  which she knew too well he would carry out, she feigned consent, and  gave the Turk a rendezvous at her house at an hour when she said her  husband would be absent; but by arrangement the husband arrived, and  although the Turk was armed with a sabre and a pair of pistols, it so  befell that they were fortunate enough to kill their enemy, whom they  buried under their dwelling unknown to all the world. But some days  after the event they went to confess to a priest of their nation, and  revealed every detail of the tragic story. This unworthy minister of the  Lord supposed that in a Mahommedan country, where the laws of the  priesthood and the functions of a confessor are either unknown or  disapproved, no examination would be made into the source of his  information, and that his evidence would have the same weight as any  other accuser's. So he resolved to make a profit and gratify his own  avarice. Several times he visited the husband and wife, always borrowing  considerable sums, and threatening to reveal their crime if they refused  him. The first few times the poor creatures gave in to his exactions;  but the moment came at last when, robbed of all their fortune, they were  obliged to refuse the sum he demanded. Faithful to his threat, the  priest, with a view to more reward, at once denounced them to the dead  man's father. He, who had adored his son, went to the vizier, told him  he had identified the murderers through their confessor, and asked for  justice. But this denunciation had by no means the desired effect. The  vizier, on the contrary, felt deep pity for the wretched Armenians, and  indignation against the priest who had betrayed them. He put the accuser  into a room which adjoined the court, and sent for the Armenian bishop  to ask what confession really was, and what punishment was deserved by a  priest who betrayed it, and what was the fate of those whose crimes were  made known in this fashion. The bishop replied that the secrets of  confession are inviolable, that Christians burn the priest who reveals  them, and absolve those whom he accuses, because the avowal made by the  guilty to the priest is proscribed by the Christian religion, on pain of  eternal damnation. The vizier, satisfied with the answer, took the  bishop into another room, and summoned the accused to declare all the  circumstances: the poor wretches, half dead, fell at the vizier's feet.  The woman spoke, explaining that the necessity of defending life and  honour had driven them to take up arms to kill their enemy. She added  that God alone had witnessed their crime, and it would still be unknown  had not the law of the same God compelled them to confide it to the ear  of one of His ministers for their forgiveness. Now the priest's  insatiable avarice had ruined them first and then denounced them. The  vizier made them go into a third room, and ordered the treacherous  priest to be confronted with the bishop, making him again rehearse the  penalties incurred by those who betray confessions. Then, applying this  to the guilty priest, he condemned him to be burnt alive in a public  place;--in anticipation, said he, of burning in hell, where he would  assuredly receive the punishment of his infidelity and crimes. The  sentence was executed without delay.    In spite of the effect which the advocate intended to produce by these  three cases, either the judges rejected them, or perhaps they thought  the other evidence without the confession was enough, and it was soon  clear to everyone, by the way the trial went forward, that the marquise  would be condemned. Indeed, before sentence was pronounced, on the  morning of July 16th, 1676, she saw M. Pirot, doctor of the Sorbonne,  come into her prison, sent by the chief president. This worthy  magistrate, foreseeing the issue, and feeling that one so guilty should  not be left till the last moment, had sent the good priest. The latter,  although he had objected that the Conciergerie had its own two  chaplains, and added that he was too feeble to undertake such a task,  being unable even to see another man bled without feeling ill, accepted  the painful mission, the president having so strongly urged it, on the  ground that in this case he needed a man who could be entirely trusted.  The president, in fact, declared that, accustomed as he was to dealing  with criminals, the strength of the marquise amazed him. The day before  he summoned M. Pirot, he had worked at the trial from morning to night,  and for thirteen hours the accused had been confronted with Briancourt,  one of the chief witnesses against her. On that very day, there had been  five hours more, and she had borne it all, showing as much respect  towards her judges as haughtiness towards the witness, reproaching him  as a miserable valet, given to drink, and protesting that as he had been  dismissed for his misdemeanours, his testimony against her ought to go  for nothing. So the chief president felt no hope of breaking her  inflexible spirit, except by the agency of a minister of religion; for  it was not enough to put her to death, the poisons must perish with her,  or else society would gain nothing. The doctor Pirot came to the  marquise with a letter from her sister, who, as we know, was a nun  bearing the name of Sister Marie at the convent Saint-Jacques. Her  letter exhorted the marquise, in the most touching and affectionate  terms, to place her confidence in the good priest, and look upon him not  only as a helper but as a friend.    When M. Pirot came before the marquise, she had just left the dock,  where she had been for three hours without confessing anything, or  seeming in the least touched by what the president said, though he,  after acting the part of judge, addressed her simply as a Christian, and  showing her what her deplorable position was, appearing now for the last  time before men, and destined so soon to appear before God, spoke to her  such moving words that he broke down himself, and the oldest and most  obdurate judges present wept when they heard him. When the marquise  perceived the doctor, suspecting that her trial was leading her to  death, she approached him, saying:    \"You have come, sir, because----\"    But Father Chavigny, who was with M. Pirot; interrupted her, saying:    \"Madame, we will begin with a prayer.\"    They all fell on their knees invoking the Holy Spirit; then the marquise  asked them to add a prayer to the Virgin, and, this prayer finished, she  went up to the doctor, and, beginning afresh, said:    \"Sir, no doubt the president has sent you to give me consolation: with  you I am to pass the little life I have left. I have long been eager to  see you.\"    \"Madame,\" the doctor replied, \"I come to render you any spiritual office  that I can; I only wish it were on another occasion.\"    \"We must have resolution, sir,\" said she, smiling, \"for all things.\"    Then turning to Father Chavigny, she said:    \"My father, I am very grateful to you for bringing the doctor here, and  for all the other visits you have been willing to pay me. Pray to God  for me, I entreat you; henceforth I shall speak with no one but the  doctor, for with him I must speak of things that can only be discussed  tete-a-tete. Farewell, then, my father; God will reward you for the  attention you have been willing to bestow upon me.\"    With these words the father retired, leaving the marquise alone with the  doctor and the two men and one woman always in attendance on her. They  were in a large room in the Montgomery tower extending, throughout its  whole length. There was at the end of the room a bed with grey curtains  for the lady, and a folding-bed for the custodian. It is said to have  been the same room where the poet Theophile was once shut up, and near  the door there were still verses in his well-known style written by his  hand.    As soon as the two men and the woman saw for what the doctor had come,  they retired to the end of the room, leaving the marquise free to ask  for and receive the consolations brought her by the man of God. Then the  two sat at a table side by side. The marquise thought she was already  condemned, and began to speak on that assumption; but the doctor told  her that sentence was not yet given, and he did not know precisely when  it would be, still less what it would be; but at these words the  marquise interrupted him.    \"Sir,\" she said, \"I am not troubled about the future. If my sentence is  not given yet, it soon will be. I expect the news this morning, and I  know it will be death: the only grace I look for from the president is a  delay between the sentence and its execution; for if I were executed  to-day I should have very little time to prepare, and I feel I have need  for more.\"    The doctor did not expect such words, so he was overjoyed to learn what  she felt. In addition to what the president had said, he had heard from  Father Chavigny that he had told her the Sunday before that it was very  unlikely she would escape death, and indeed, so far as one could judge  by reports in the town, it was a foregone conclusion. When he said so,  at first she had appeared stunned, and said with an air of great terror,  \"Father, must I die?\" And when he tried to speak words of consolation,  she had risen and shaken her head, proudly replying--    \"No, no, father; there is no need to encourage me. I will play my part,  and that at once: I shall know how to die like a woman of spirit.\"    Then the father "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27560"],[0,"The 2005 CIA World Factbook (#9)"],[1,"rights for the purpose of exploring and  exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether  living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of  the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the  economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the  production of energy from the water, currents, and winds; jurisdiction  with regard to the establishment and use of artificial islands,  installations, and structures; marine scientific research; the  protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer limit  of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical miles from  the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is  measured.  continental shelf - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental  shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the  submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the  natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the  continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the  baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured  where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to  that distance; the continental margin comprises the submerged  prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and consists of the  seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise; wherever the  continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline,  coastal states may extend their claim to a distance not to exceed 350  nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2500  meter isobath; it does not include the deep ocean floor with its  oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.  exclusive fishing zone - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS,  some states (e.g. the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an EEZ,  but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off their  coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often used;  the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or 200  nautical miles.    Median age  This entry is the age that divides a population into two numerically  equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and  half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age  distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from a  low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several  European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for the  importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by  implication, a low versus a higher median age.    Merchant marine  Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage of  goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships),  which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. This  entry contains information in four fields - total, ships by type,  foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.  Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for  those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage  is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc., that a ship  can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line. GRT or gross  register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered  volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers and converting it  to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is no stable  relationship between GRT and DWT. Ships  by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo  ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil  carriers, container ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers,  multifunctional large-load carriers, petroleum tankers, passenger  ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo  ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,  specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.  Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong to  owners in another.  Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one  country but fly the flag of another.    Military  This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military  structure, manpower, and expenditures.    Military - note  This entry includes miscellaneous military information of significance  not included elsewhere.    Military branches  This entry lists the names of the ground, naval, air, marine, and other  defense or security forces.    Military expenditures - dollar figure  This entry gives current military expenditures in US dollars; the  figure is calculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in  percentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP) calculated on an  exchange rate basis, not purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. Dollar  figures for military expenditures should be treated with caution  because of different price patterns and accounting methods among  nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of their  currencies.    Military expenditures - percent of GDP  This entry gives current military expenditures as an estimated percent  of gross domestic product (GDP). These figures are calculated on an  exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Military service age and obligation  This entry gives the minimum age at which an individual may volunteer  for military service or be subject to conscription.    Money figures  All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless  otherwise indicated.    National holiday  This entry gives the primary national day of celebration - usually  independence day.    Nationality  This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens - noun and  adjective.    Natural gas - consumption  This entry is the total natural gas consumed in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission  of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - exports  This entry is the total natural gas exported in cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - imports  This entry is the total natural gas imported in cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - production  This entry is the total natural gas produced in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission  of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - proved reserves  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of natural gas in cubic  meters (cu m). Proved reserves are those quantities of natural gas,  which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated  with a high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a  given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.    Natural hazards  This entry lists potential natural disasters.    Natural resources  This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other  resources of commercial importance.    Net migration rate  This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of  persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000  persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering  the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56  migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as  net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net  migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall  level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems  such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people  are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain  key sectors (if people are leaving).    Oil - consumption  This entry is the total oil consumed in barrels per day (bbl/day). The  discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of stock  changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - exports  This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - imports  This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - production  This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per day (bbl/day). The  discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of stock  changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - proved reserves  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of crude oil in barrels  (bbl). Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by  analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with a  high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a given  date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.    People  This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics of  the people and their society.    People - note  This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Personal Names - Capitalization  The Factbook capitalizes the surname or family name of individuals for  the convenience of our users who are faced with a world of different  cultures and naming conventions. The need for capitalization, bold  type, underlining, italics, or some other indicator of the individual's  surname is apparent in the following examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO  Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-  Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah. By knowing the surname, a short  form without all capital letters can be used with confidence as in  President Castro, Chairman"]]]
