Traditions of Wanderings  Hopi (Arizona)    After the Hopi had been taught to build stone houses, they took  separate ways. My people were the Snake people. They lived in snake  skins, each family occupying a separate snake skin bag. All were hung on  the end of a rainbow which swung around until the end touched Navajo  Mountain. Then the bags dropped from it. Wherever a bag dropped, there  was their house. After they arranged their bags they came out from them  as men and women, and they then built a stone house which had five  sides. Then a brilliant star arose in the southeast. It would shine for  a while and disappear.    The old men said, \"'Beneath that star there must be people.\" They  decided to travel to it. They cut a staff and set it in the ground and  watched until the star reached its top. Then they started and travelled  as long as the star shone. When it disappeared they halted. But the star  did not shine every night. Sometimes many years passed before it  appeared again. When this occurred, the people built houses during their  halt. They built round houses and square houses, and all the ruins  between here and Navajo Mountain mark the places where our people lived.  They waited until the star came to the top of the staff again, but when  they moved on, many people remained in those houses.    When our people reached Waipho (a spring a few miles from Walpi) the  star vanished. It has never been seen since. They built a house there,  but Masauwu, the God of the Face of the Earth, came and compelled the  people to move about halfway between the East Mesa and the Middle Mesa  and there they stayed many plantings. One time when the old men were  assembled, the god came among them, looking like a horrible skeleton and  rattling his bones. But he could not frighten them. So he said, \"I have  lost my wager. All that I have is yours. Ask for anything you want and I  will give it to you.\"    At that time, our people's house was beside the water course. The god  said, \"Why do you sit there in the mud? Go up yonder where it is dry.\"    So they went across to the west side of the mesa near the point and  built a house and lived there.    Again when the old men assembled two demons came among them, but the old  men took the great Baho and chased them away.    Other Hopi (Hopituh) came into this country from time to time and old  people said, \"Build here,\" or \"Build there,\" and portioned the land  among the newcomers.          The Migration of the Water People  Walpi (Arizona)    In the long ago, the Snake, Horn, and Eagle people lived here (in  Tusayan) but their corn grew only a span high and when they sang for  rain, the Cloud god sent only a thin mist. My people lived then in the  distant Pa-lat Kwa-bi in the South. There was a very bad old man there.  When he met any one he would spit in their faces.... He did all  manner of evil. Baholihonga got angry at this and turned the world  upside down. Water spouted up through the kivas and through the fire  places in the houses. The earth was rent in great chasms, and water  covered everything except one narrow ridge of mud. Across this the  Serpent-god told all the people to travel. As they journeyed across, the  feet of the bad slipped and they fell into the dark water. The good  people, after many days, reached dry land.    While the water was rising around the village, the old people got on top  of the houses. They thought they could not struggle across with the  younger people. But Baholihonga clothed them with the skins of turkeys.  They spread their wings out and floated in the air just above the  surface of the water, and in this way they got across. There were saved  of us, the Water people, the Corn people, the Lizard, Horned-toad, and  Sand peoples, two families of Rabbit, and the Tobacco people. The turkey  tail dragged in the water. That is why there is white on the turkey's  tail now. This is also the reason why old people use turkey-feathers at  the religious ceremonies.          Coyote and the Mesquite Beans  Pima (Arizona)    After the waters of the flood had gone down, Elder Brother said to  Coyote, \"Do not touch that black bug; and do not eat the mesquite beans.  It is dangerous to harm anything that came safe through the flood.\"    So Coyote went on, but presently he came to the black bug. He stopped  and ate it up. Then he went on to the mesquite beans. He stopped and  looked at them a while, and then said, \"I will just taste one and that  will be all.\" But he stood there and ate and ate until he had eaten them  all up. And the bug and the beans swelled up in his stomach and killed  him.          Origin of the Sierra Nevadas and Coast Range  Yokuts (near Fresno, Cal.)    Once there was a time when there was nothing in the world but water.  About the place where Tulare Lake is now, there was a pole standing far  up out of the water, and on this pole perched Hawk and Crow. First Hawk  would sit on the pole a while, then Crow would knock him off and sit on  it himself. Thus they sat on the top of the pole above the water for  many ages. At last they created the birds which prey on fish. They  created Kingfisher, Eagle, Pelican, and others. They created also Duck.  Duck was very small but she dived to the bottom of the water, took a  beakful of mud, and then died in coming to the top of the water. Duck  lay dead floating on the water. Then Hawk and Crow took the mud from  Duck's beak, and began making the mountains.    They began at the place now known as Ta-hi-cha-pa Pass, and Hawk made  the east range. Crow made the west one. They pushed the mud down hard  into the water and then piled it high. They worked toward the north. At  last Hawk and Crow met at Mount Shasta. Then their work was done. But  when they looked at their mountains, Crow's range was much larger than  Hawk's.    Hawk said to Crow, \"How did this happen, you rascal? You have been  stealing earth from my bill. That is why your mountains are the  biggest.\" Crow laughed.    Then Hawk chewed some Indian tobacco. That made him wise. At once he  took hold of the mountains and turned them around almost in a circle. He  put his range where Crow's had been. That is why the Sierra Nevada Range  is larger than the Coast Range.          Yosemite Valley  (Explanatory) (3)    Mr. Stephen Powers claims that there is no such word in the Miwok  language as Yosemite. The valley has always been known to them, and is  to this day, when speaking among themselves, as A-wa'-ni. This, it is  true, is only the name of one of the ancient villages which it  contained; but by prominence it gave its name to the valley, and in  accordance with Indian usage almost everywhere, to the inhabitants of  the same. The word Yosemite is simply a very beautiful and sonorous  corruption of the word for grizzly bear. On the Stanislaus and north of  it, the word is u-zu'-mai-ti; at Little Gap, o-so'-mai-ti; in  Yosemite itself, u-zu'-mai-ti; on the South Fork of the Merced,  uh-zu'-mai-tuh....    \"In the following list, the signification of the name is given whenever  there is any known to the Indians:    \"Wa-kal'-la (the river), Merced River.    \"Lung-u-tu-ku'-ya, Ribbon Fall.    \"Po'-ho-no, Po-ho'-no (though the first is probably the more correct),  Bridal-Veil Fall.... This word is said to signify 'evil wind.' The  only 'evil wind' that an Indian knows of is a whirlwind, which is  poi-i'-cha or Kan'-u-ma.    \"Tu-tok-a-nu'-la, El Capitan. 'Measuring-worm stone.' [Legend is given  elsewhere.]    \"Ko-su'-ko, Cathedral Rock.    \"Pu-si'-na, and Chuk'-ka (the squirrel and the acorn-cache), a tall,  sharp needle, with a smaller one at its base, just east of Cathedral  Rock.... The savages... imagined here a squirrel nibbling at the  base of an acorn granary.    \"Loi'-a, Sentinel Rock.    \"Sak'-ka-du-eh, Sentinel Dome.    \"Cho'-lok (the fall), Yosemite Fall. This is the generic word for 'fall.'    \"Ma'-ta (the canon), Indian canon. A generic word, in explaining which  the Indians hold up both hands to denote perpendicular walls.    \"Ham'-mo-ko (usually contracted to Ham'-moak),... broken debris lying  at the foot of the walls.    \"U-zu'-mai-ti La'-wa-tuh (grizzly bear skin), Glacier Rock... from  the grayish, grizzled appearance of the wall.    \"Cho-ko-nip'-o-deh (baby-basket), Royal Arches.

S. Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain  region, Part 2, Contributions to North American Ethnology, 1877.          Legend of Tu-Tok-A-Nu'-La (El Capitan)  Yosemite Valley    Here were once two little boys living in the valley who went down to the  river to swim. After paddling and splashing about to their hearts'  content, they went on shore and crept up on a huge boulder which stood  beside the water. They lay down in the warm sunshine to dry themselves,  but fell asleep. They slept so soundly that they knew nothing, though  the great boulder grew day by day, and rose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#9)"],[1,"speed over a mountain  ridge, we found ourselves suddenly confronted with a strong English  mounted corps, apparently engaged in drilling. We were only 500 paces  away from them, and we jumped off our horses, and opened fire. But  there were only a dozen of us, and the enemy soon began sending us a  few shells, and prepared to attack us with their whole force. About a  hundred mounted men, with horses in the best of condition, set off to  pursue us.    We were obliged to ride back by the same path we had come by, which  was fortunate for us, as we knew the way and could ride through  crevices and dongas without any hesitation. In this way we soon gave  our pursuers the slip.    Buller's forces seemed at first to have the intention of forcing their  way through near Potgietersdrift, and they took possession of all the  \"randts\" on their side of the river, causing us to strengthen the  position on our side. We thus had to shift our commando again to  Potgietersdrift, where we soon had the enemy's Naval guns playing on  our positions. This continued day and night for a whole week.    It seemed as if General Buller were determined to annihilate all the  Boers with his lyddite shells, so as to enable the soldiers to walk at  their leisure to the release of Ladysmith. Certainly we suffered  considerably from lyddite fumes.    The British next made a feint attack near Potgietersdrift, advancing  with a great clamour till they had come within 2,000 paces of us,  where they occupied various \"randts\" and kopjes, always under cover of  their artillery. Once they came a little too close to our positions,  and we suddenly opened fire on them. The result was that their  ambulance waggons were seen to become very busy driving backwards and  forwards.    This \"feint,\" however, was only made in order to divert our attention,  while Buller was concentrating his troops and guns on Spion Kop. The  ruse succeeded to a large extent, and on the 21st January the  memorable battle of Spion Kop (near the Upper Tugela) began.    General Warren, who, I believe, was in command here, had ordered  another \"feint\" attack from the extreme right wing. General Cronje and  the Free Staters had taken up a position at Spion Kop, assisted by the  commandos of General Erasmus and Schalk Burger.    The fight lasted the whole of that day and the next, and became more  and more fierce. Luckily General Botha appeared on the scene in time,  and re-arranged matters so well and with so much energy that the enemy  found itself well employed, and was kept in check at all points.    I had been ordered to defend the position at Potgietersdrift, but the  fighting round Spion Kop became so serious that I was obliged to send  up a field cornet with his men as a reinforcement, which was soon  followed by a second contingent, making altogether 200 Johannesburgers  in the fight, of whom nine were killed and 18 wounded. The enemy had  reached the top of the \"kop\" on the evening of the second day of the  fight, not, however, without having sustained considerable losses. At  this juncture one of our generals felt so disheartened that he sent  away his carts, and himself left the battlefield.    But General Botha kept his ground like a man, surrounded by the  faithful little band who had already borne the brunt of this important  battle. And one can imagine our delight when next morning we found  that the English had retreated, leaving that immense battlefield,  strewn with hundreds of dead and wounded, in our hands.    \"What made them leave so suddenly last night,\" was the question we  asked each other then, and which remains unanswered to this day.    General Warren has stated that the cause of his departure was the want  of water, but I can hardly credit that statement, as water could be  obtained all the way to the top of Spion Kop; and even had it been  wanting it is not likely that after a sacrifice of 1,200 to 1,300  lives the position would have been abandoned on this account alone.  Our victory was undoubtedly a fluke.          CHAPTER X.    THE BATTLE OF VAALKRANTZ.      Soon after his defeat at Spion Kop, General Buller, moved by the  earnest entreaties for help from Ladysmith, and pressed by Lord  Roberts, attempted a third time to break through our lines. This time  my position had to bear the onslaught of his whole forces. For some  days it had been clear to me what the enemy intended to do, but I  wired in vain to the Commander-in-Chief to send me reinforcements, and  I was left to defend a front, one and a half miles in length, with  about 400 men. After many requests I at last moved General Joubert to  send me one of the guns known as \"Long Toms,\" which was placed at the  rear of our position, and enabled us to command the Vaalkrantz, or, as  we called it, \"Pontdrift\" kopjes. But instead of the required  reinforcements, the Commander sent a telegram to General Meyer to  Colenso, telling him to come and speak to me, and to put some heart  into me, for it seemed, he said, \"as if I had lost faith.\"    General Meyer came, and I explained to him how matters stood, and that  I should not be able to check the enormous attacking force with my  commando alone. The British were at this time only 7,000 paces away  from us. The required assistance, however, never came, although I told  the General that a faith strong enough to move Majuba Hill would be of  no avail without a sufficient number of men.    Early in the morning of the 5th February, 1900, my position was  heavily bombarded, and before the sun had risen four of my burghers  had been put _hors de combat_. The enemy had placed their naval guns  on the outskirts of the wood known as \"Zwartkop\" so as to be able to  command our position from an elevation of about 400 feet. I happened  to be on the right flank with ninety-five burghers and a pom-pom; my  assistant, Commandant Jaapie du Preez, commanding the left flank.    The assailants threw two pontoon bridges across the river and troops  kept pouring over from 10 o'clock in the morning. The whole of the  guns' fire was now concentrated on my position; and although we  answered with a well-directed fire, they charged time after time.    The number of my fighting men was rapidly diminishing. I may say this  was the heaviest bombardment I witnessed during the whole of the  campaign. It seemed to me as if all the guns of the British army were  being fired at us.    Their big lyddite guns sent over huge shells, which mowed down all the  trees on the kopje, while about fifty field pieces were incessantly  barking away from a shorter range. Conan Doyle, in his book, \"The  Great Boer War,\" states that the British had concentrated no less than  seventy-three guns on that kopje. In vain I implored the nearest  Generals for reinforcements and requested our artillery in Heaven's  name to aim at the enemy's guns. At last, however, \"Long Tom\"  commenced operations, but the artillerymen in charge had omitted to  put the powder in a safe place and it was soon struck by a lyddite  shell which set the whole of it on fire. This compelled us to send to  the head laager near Ladysmith for a fresh supply of powder.    On looking about me to see how my burghers were getting on I found  that many around me had been killed and others were wounded. The  clothes of the latter were burnt and they cried out for help in great  agony.    Our pom-pom had long since been silenced by the enemy, and thirty of  my burghers had been put out of the fight. The enemy's infantry was  advancing nearer and nearer and there was not much time left to think.  I knelt down behind a kopje, along with some of the men, and we kept  firing away at 400 paces, but although we sent a good many to eternal  rest, the fire of the few burghers who were left was too weak to stem  the onslaught of those overwhelming numbers.    A lyddite shell suddenly burst over our very heads. Four burghers with  me were blown to pieces and my rifle was smashed. It seemed to me as  if a huge cauldron of boiling fat had burst over us and for some  minutes I must have lost consciousness. A mouthful of brandy and water  (which I always carried with me) was given me and restored me  somewhat, and when I opened my eyes I saw the enemy climbing the kopje  on three sides of us, some of them only a hundred paces away from me.    I ordered my men to fall back and took charge of the pom-pom, and we  then retired under a heavy rifle and gun fire. Some English writers  have made much ado about the way in which our pom-pom was saved, but  it was nothing out of the ordinary. Of the 95 burghers with me 29 had  been killed, 24 wounded.    When I had a few minutes rest I felt a piercing pain in my head, and  the blood began to pour from my nose and ears.    We had taken up another position at 1,700 paces, and fired our pom-pom  at the enemy, who now occupied our position of a few minutes before.  Our other guns were being fired as well, which gave the British an  exciting quarter of an hour. On the right and left of the positions  taken by them our burghers were still in possession of the \"randten\";  to the right Jaapie du Preez, with the loss of only four wounded, kept  his ground with the rest of my commando.    The next morning the fight was renewed, and our \"Long Tom\" now took  the lead in the cannon-concert, and seemed to make himself very  unpleasant to the enemy.    The whole day was mainly a battle of big guns. My headache grew  unbearable, and I was very feverish. General Botha had meanwhile  arrived with reinforcements, and towards evening things took a better  turn.    But I was temporarily done for, and again lost consciousness, and was  taken to the ambulance. Dr. Shaw did his best, I hear, for me; but I  was unconscious for several days, and when I revived the doctor told  me I had a slight fracture of the skull caused by the bursting of a  shell. The injuries, however, could not have been very serious for ten  days after I"]]]
