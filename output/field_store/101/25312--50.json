The third voyage made by Cartier to the new world, in 1541, was  relatively of little importance.  Donnacona and the other Indians of  Stadacona, whom the French carried away with them, never returned to  their forest homes, but died in France.  During the year Cartier  remained in Canada he built a fortified post at Cap Rouge, about seven  miles west of the heights of Quebec, and named it Charlesbourg in  honour of one of the sons of Francis the First.  He visited Hochelaga,  and attempted to pass up the river beyond the village, but was stopped  by the dangerous rapids now known as the St. Louis or Lachine.  He  returned to France in the spring of 1542, with a few specimens of  worthless metal resembling gold which he found among the rocks of Cap  Rouge, and some pieces of quartz crystal which he believed were  diamonds, and which have given the name to the bold promontory on which  stand the ancient fortifications of Quebec.    [Illustration: The \"Dauphin Map\" of Canada, _circa_ 1543, showing  Cartier's Discoveries.]    {45}    Cartier is said to have returned on a fourth voyage to Canada in  1543--though no record exists--for the purpose of bringing back  Monsieur Roberval, otherwise known to the history of those times as  Jean Francois de la Roque, who had been appointed by Francis his  lieutenant in Canada, Hochelaga, Saguenay, Newfoundland, Belle Isle,  Carpunt, Labrador, the Great Bay (St. Lawrence), and Baccalaos, as well  as lord of the mysterious region of Norumbega--an example of the lavish  use of titles and the assumption of royal dominion in an unknown  wilderness.  Roberval and Cartier were to have sailed in company to  Canada in 1541, but the former could not complete his arrangements and  the latter sailed alone, as we have just read.  On his return in 1542  Cartier is said to have met Roberval at a port of the Gulf, and to have  secretly stolen away in the night and left his chief to go on to the  St. Lawrence alone.  But these are among historic questions in dispute,  and it is useless to dwell on them here.  What we do know to a  certainty is that Roberval spent some months on the banks of the St.  Lawrence,--probably from the spring of 1542 to late in the autumn of  1543,--and built a commodious fort at Charlesbourg, which he renamed  France-Roy.  He passed a miserable winter, as many of the colonists he  had brought with him had been picked up amongst the lowest classes of  France, and he had to govern his ill-assorted company with a rigid and  even cruel hand.  Roberval is said to have visited the Saguenay and  explored its waters and surrounding country for a considerable  distance, evidently hoping {46} to verify the fables of Donnacona and  other Indians that gold and precious stones were to be found somewhere  in that region.  His name has been given to a little village at Lake  St. John, on the assumption that he actually went so far on his  Saguenay expedition, while romantic tradition points to an isle in the  Gulf, the Isle de la Demoiselle, where he is said to have abandoned his  niece Marguerite,--who had loved not wisely but too well--her lover,  and an old nurse.  This rocky spot appears to have become in the story  an isle of Demons who tormented the poor wretches, exposed to all the  rigours of Canadian winters, and to starvation except when they could  catch fish or snare wild fowl.  The nurse and lover as well as the  infant died, but Marguerite is said to have remained much longer on  that lonely island until at last Fate brought to her rescue a passing  vessel and carried her to France, where she is said to have told the  story of her adventures.    After this voyage Roberval disappeared from the history of Canada.  Cartier is supposed to have died about 1577 in his old manor house of  Limoilou, now in ruins, in the neighbourhood of St. Malo.  He was  allowed by the King to bear always the name of \"Captain\"--an  appropriate title for a hardy sailor who represented so well the  heroism and enterprise of the men of St. Malo and the Breton coast.  The results of the voyages of Cartier, Roberval, and the sailors and  fishermen who frequented the waters of the Great Bay, as the French  long called it, can be seen in the old maps that have come down to us,  and show the increasing geographical knowledge.  {47} To this  knowledge, a famous pilot, Captain Jehan Alfonce, a native of the  little village of Saintonge in the grape district of Charente, made  valuable contributions.  He accompanied Roberval to Canada, and  afterwards made voyages to the Saguenay, and appears to have explored  the Gulf and the coasts of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and even Maine as  far as the Penobscot, where he believed was the city of Norumbega.    After the death of Francis there came dark days for France, whose  people were torn asunder by civil war and religious strife.  With the  return of peace in France the Marquis de la Roche received a commission  from Henry the Fourth, as lieutenant-general of the King, to colonise  Canada, but his ill-fated expedition of 1597 never got beyond the  dangerous sandbanks of Sable Island.  French fur-traders had now found  their way to Anticosti and even Tadousac, at the mouth of the Saguenay,  where the Indians were wont to assemble in large numbers from the great  fur-region to which that melancholy river and its tributary lakes and  rivers give access, but these traders like the fishermen made no  attempt to settle the country.    From a very early date in the sixteenth century bold sailors from the  west country of Devon were fishing in the Gulf and eventually made the  safe and commodious port of St. John's, in Newfoundland, their  headquarters.  Some adventurous Englishmen even made a search for the  land of Norumbega, and probably reached the bay of Penobscot.  Near the  close of the century, Frobisher attempted to open up {48} the secrets  of the Arctic seas and find that passage to the north which remained  closed to venturesome explorers until Sir Robert McClure, in 1850,  successfully passed the icebergs and ice-floes that barred his way from  Bering Sea to Davis Strait.  In the reign of the great Elizabeth, when  Englishmen were at last showing that ability for maritime enterprise  which was eventually to develop such remarkable results, Sir Humphrey  Gilbert, the half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh, the founder of  Virginia, the Old Dominion, took possession of Newfoundland with much  ceremony in the harbour of St. John's, and erected a pillar on which  were inscribed the Queen's arms.  Gilbert had none of the qualities of  a coloniser, and on his voyage back to England he was lost at sea, and  it was left to the men of Devon and the West coast in later times to  make a permanent settlement on the great island of the Gulf.    The first years of the seventeenth century were propitious for  important schemes of colonisation and trade in the western lands.  The  sovereign of France was Henry the Fourth, the intrepid Prince of Bearn,  as brave a soldier as he was a sagacious statesman.  Henry listened  favourably--though his able minister, Sully, held different views--to  the schemes for opening up Canada to commerce and settlement that were  laid before him by an old veteran of the wars, and a staunch friend,  Aymar de Chastes, governor of Dieppe.  Pontgrave, a rich Breton  merchant of St. Malo, had the charge of the two vessels which left  France in the spring of 1603, but it is a fact that a great man, Samuel  Champlain, accompanied the {49} expedition that gives the chief  interest to the voyage.  Champlain, who was destined to be the founder  of New France, was a native of Brouage in the Bay of Biscay, and  belonged to a family of fishermen.  During the war of the League he  served in the army of Henry the Third, but when Henry of Navarre was  proclaimed King of France on the assassination of his predecessor, and  abjured the Protestant faith of which he had previously been the  champion, Champlain, like other Frenchmen, who had followed the Duke of  Guise, became an ardent supporter of the new regime and eventually a  favourite of the Bernese prince.  He visited the West Indies in a  Spanish ship and made himself well acquainted with Mexico and other  countries bordering on the Gulf.  He has described all his voyages to  the Indies and Canada in quaint quarto volumes, now very rare, and  valuable on account of their minute and truthful narrative--despite his  lively and credulous imagination--and the drawings and maps which he  made rudely of the places he saw.  His accounts of the Indians of  Canada are among the most valuable that have come to us from the early  days of American history.  He had a fair knowledge of natural history  for those times, though he believed in Mexican griffins, and was versed  in geography and cartography.    In 1603 Pontgrave and Champlain ascended the River St. Lawrence as far  as the island of Montreal, where they found only a few wandering  Algonquins of the Ottawa and its tributaries, in place of the people  who had inhabited the town of Hochelaga in the days of Cartier's  visits.  Champlain attempted to {50} pass the Lachine rapids but was  soon forced to give up the perilous and impossible venture.  During  this voyage he explored the Saguenay for a considerable distance, and  was able to add largely to the information that Cartier had given of  Canada and the country around the Gulf.  When the expedition reached  France, Aymar de Chastes was dead, but two months had hardly elapsed  after Champlain's return when a new company was formed on the usual  basis of trade and colonisation.  At its head was Sieur de Monts,  Pierre du Guast, the governor of Pons, a Calvinist and a friend of the  King.  After much deliberation it was decided to venture south of  Canada and explore that ill-defined region, called \"La Cadie\" in the  royal commission given to De Monts"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22566"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#9)"],[1," feet above the earth the kitten found she could go  nearly two hundred feet. So she ran along over their heads until she had  left them far behind and below and had come to the city and the House of  the Sorcerer. There she entered in at Dorothy's window in the dome and  aroused her from her sleep.    As soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened the  Wizard and Zeb, and at once preparations were made to go to the rescue  of Jim and the piglets. The Wizard carried his satchel, which was quite  heavy, and Zeb carried the two lanterns and the oil can. Dorothy's  wicker suit-case was still under the seat of the buggy, and by good  fortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when he had  taken it off from Jim to let the horse lie down and rest. So there was  nothing for the girl to carry but the kitten, which she held close to  her bosom and tried to comfort, for its little heart was still beating  rapidly.    Some of the Mangaboos discovered them as soon as they left the House of  the Sorcerer; but when they started toward the mountain the vegetable  people allowed them to proceed without interference, yet followed in a  crowd behind them so that they could not go back again.    Before long they neared the Black Pit, where a busy swarm of Mangaboos,  headed by their Princess, was engaged in piling up glass rocks before  the entrance.    \"Stop, I command you!\" cried the Wizard, in an angry tone, and at once  began pulling down the rocks to liberate Jim and the piglets. Instead of  opposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made a  good-sized hole in the barrier, when by order of the Princess they all  sprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns.    [Illustration: THROUGH THE BLACK PIT.]    Dorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked, and Zeb and  the Wizard, after enduring a few stabs from the thorns, were glad to  follow her. At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glass  again, and as the little man realized that they were all about to be  entombed in the mountain he said to the children:    \"My dears, what shall we do? Jump out and fight?\"    \"What's the use?\" replied Dorothy. \"I'd as soon die here as live much  longer among those cruel and heartless people.\"    \"That's the way I feel about it,\" remarked Zeb, rubbing his wounds.  \"I've had enough of the Mangaboos.\"    \"All right,\" said the Wizard; \"I'm with you, whatever you decide. But we  can't live long in this cavern, that's certain.\"    Noticing that the light was growing dim he picked up his nine piglets,  patted each one lovingly on its fat little head, and placed them  carefully in his inside pocket.    Zeb struck a match and lighted one of the lanterns. The rays of the  colored suns were now shut out from them forever, for the last chinks  had been filled up in the wall that separated their prison from the Land  of the Mangaboos.    \"How big is this hole?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I'll explore it and see,\" replied the boy.    So he carried the lantern back for quite a distance, while Dorothy and  the Wizard followed at his side. The cavern did not come to an end, as  they had expected it would, but slanted upward through the great glass  mountain, running in a direction that promised to lead them to the side  opposite the Mangaboo country.    \"It isn't a bad road,\" observed the Wizard, \"and if we followed it it  might lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this black  pocket we are now in. I suppose the vegetable folk were always afraid to  enter this cavern because it is dark; but we have our lanterns to light  the way, so I propose that we start out and discover where this tunnel  in the mountain leads to.\"    The others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion, and at once the  boy began to harness Jim to the buggy. When all was in readiness the  three took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along the  way, Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lighted  lantern so the horse could see where to go.    Sometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazed  the sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floor  was usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without any  accident. Jim stopped sometimes to rest, for the climb was rather steep  and tiresome.    \"We must be nearly as high as the six colored suns, by this time,\" said  Dorothy. \"I didn't know this mountain was so tall.\"    \"We are certainly a good distance away from the Land of the Mangaboos,\"  added Zeb; \"for we have slanted away from it ever since we started.\"    But they kept steadily moving, and just as Jim was about tired out with  his long journey the way suddenly grew lighter, and Zeb put out the  lanterns to save the oil.    To their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them, for  all were weary of the colored rainbow lights which, after a time, had  made their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays. The sides of  the tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spy-glass, and  the floor became more level. Jim hastened his lagging steps at this  assurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, and in a few moments  more they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face to  face with a new and charming country.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 8.    THE VALLEY OF VOICES      By journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightful  valley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with another  rugged mountain showing on the other side of it, and soft and pretty  green hills at the ends. It was all laid out into lovely lawns and  gardens, with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautiful  and stately trees dotting the landscape here and there. There were  orchards, too, bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our  world. Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between their  flower-strewn banks, while scattered over the valley were dozens of the  quaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever beheld.  None of them were in clusters, such as villages or towns, but each had  ample grounds of its own, with orchards and gardens surrounding it.    As the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were enraptured  by its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft air, which  they breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of the tunnel.  Several minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticed  two very singular and unusual facts about this valley. One was that it  was lighted from some unseen source; for no sun or moon was in the  arched blue sky, although every object was flooded with a clear and  perfect light. The second and even more singular fact was the absence of  any inhabitant of this splendid place. From their elevated position they  could overlook the entire valley, but not a single moving object could  they see. All appeared mysteriously deserted.    The mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar to  granite. With some difficulty and danger Jim drew the buggy over the  loose rocks until he reached the green lawns below, where the paths and  orchards and gardens began. The nearest cottage was still some distance  away.    \"Isn't it fine?\" cried Dorothy, in a joyous voice, as she sprang out of  the buggy and let Eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass.    \"Yes, indeed!\" answered Zeb. \"We were lucky to get away from those  dreadful vegetable people.\"    \"It wouldn't be so bad,\" remarked the Wizard, gazing around him, \"if we  were obliged to live here always. We couldn't find a prettier place, I'm  sure.\"    He took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass, and  Jim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was very  contented in his new surroundings.    \"We can't walk in the air here, though,\" called Eureka, who had tried it  and failed; but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground, and the  Wizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth than they had  been in the Mangaboo country, for everything was more homelike and  natural.    \"But where are the people?\" asked Dorothy.    The little man shook his bald head.    \"Can't imagine, my dear,\" he replied.    They heard the sudden twittering of a bird, but could not find the  creature anywhere. Slowly they walked along the path toward the nearest  cottage, the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and Jim pausing  at every step for another mouthful of grass.    Presently they came to a low plant which had broad, spreading leaves, in  the center of which grew a single fruit about as large as a peach. The  fruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant, and looked so appetizing  and delicious that Dorothy stopped and exclaimed:    \"What is it, do you s'pose?\"    The piglets had smelled the fruit quickly, and before the girl could  reach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones had  rushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness.    \"It's good, anyway,\" said Zeb, \"or those little rascals wouldn't have  gobbled it up so greedily.\"    \"Where are they?\" asked Dorothy, in astonishment.    They all looked around, but the piglets had disappeared.    \"Dear me!\" cried the Wizard; \"they must have run away. But I didn't see  them go; did you?\"    \"No!\" replied the boy and the girl, together.    \"Here,--piggy, piggy, piggy!\" called their master, anxiously.    Several squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet, but the  Wizard could not discover a single piglet.    \"Where are you?\" he asked.    \"Why, right beside you,\" spoke a tiny voice. \"Can't you see us?\"    [Illustration: \"ARE THERE REALLY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM?\"]    \"No,\" answered the little man, in a puzzled tone.    \"We can see you,\" said another of the piglets.    The Wizard stooped down and put out his hand, and at once felt the small  fat body of one of his pets. He picked "]]]
