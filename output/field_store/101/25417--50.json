The song is one of those sung to accompany the movements of the  \"calumets\" as they are thus lowered to rest. The words refer to the  search of \"the fathers\" for \"the children,\" to bring them peace, as  the eagle soars abroad and returns to its nest.         Far above the earth he soars,       Circling the clear sky,       Flying over forests dim,       Peering in shadows,       Seeking far and wide his child,       To give him peace.    [Music: THE GIFT OF PEACE.    _Otoe._    Harmonized by PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.

The three following songs have a common motive, and are parts of one  ceremonial action; but the motive is treated differently in each song,  so as to conform to the movements of the ceremony.[11] An unconscious  art is here shown, which is interesting as a bit of musical  archaeology. During the \"calumet\" ceremony among the Pawnees, if a  child cried and would not be comforted, its parents were permitted to  appeal to the \"calumets\" for help.    [Footnote 11: These songs were never before noted, and have hitherto  been sealed from the knowledge of the white race. They were given and  explained by a priest of the rite, through Mr. James R. Murie.]    The fan-shaped pendant of one of these \"calumets\" was made of the  feathers of the golden eagle. This bird in the ceremony was called  Kawas, and symbolised the peaceful and conserving power, the giver and  preserver of life, the parent of all things. It was to the priestly  bearer of this particular \"calumet\" that the parents appealed. On  receiving the appeal, the priest and his assistants arose, and,  standing beside \"the holy place,\"--the consecrated space where the  \"calumets\" were laid at ceremonial rest,--they sang this song, thus  passing on to Kawas the appeal of the parents.    [Music: KAWAS, THY BABY IS CRYING.    _Pawnee._    Transcribed from Graphophone record and Harmonized by E.S. TRACY.    Ho o Kawas ta wha-ka ra-tsa we  Kawas ta wha-ka ra-tsa we  Ah he-wi! wha-ka ra-tsa we,  Kawas ta wha-ka-ra tsa we.]    The words are in the nature of a prayer, the music has the swing of a  lullaby.         Kawas, thy baby is crying!       Grieving sore, wailing, and weeping.       Aye, forsooth! wailing and weeping,       Kawas, thy baby is crying!    Then the bearers took up the \"calumets\" and moved with slow rhythmic  steps toward the crying child, singing as they went and swaying the  sacred symbols to the measure of this song. Its meaning was explained  to me as follows:--    \"Hah-ars (a contraction of the word meaning father) signifies  Ti-ra'-wa, the power that animates all things, all animals, all men,  the heavens, and the earth. Ti-ra'-wa is represented by the Hako (the  'calumets'), and it is this power which now approaches to console the  child.\"    In the music one hears the coming of Ti-ra'-wa in the footsteps of his  creatures, both great and small.         Thy father is coming,       E'en now he is near thee;       Cry no more: the mighty one,       Thy father, is coming!    [Music: THY FATHER IS COMING.    _Pawnee._    Transcribed from Graphophone record and Harmonized by E.S. TRACY.    Ho Hah-ars si-rah ti we-ra,  Hah-ars si-ra ti we-ra  Re-ko ji!  He ti we-ra,  Hah-ars si-ra ti we-ra.]    Upon reaching the child, the golden eagle \"calumet\" was gently swayed  above it, while in the background the other \"calumet\" was waved to  ward off disturbing influences, and the priests sang this song. It is  said that on hearing it \"the child always looks up and ceases its  crying.\"    The caressing, almost playful rhythm of the music twines about the  deep religious feeling expressed in the words, like the arms of an  infant about the neck of its thoughtful, reverent parent.         Lift thine eyes, 'tis the gods who come near,       Bringing thee joy, release from all pain.       Sending sorrow and sighing       Far from the child, Ti-ra'-wa makes fain.         Ah, you look! Surely, you know who comes,       Claiming you his and bidding you rise,       Blithely smiling and happy,       Child of Ti-ra'-wa, Lord of the skies!    [Music: LOOK UP!    _Pawnee._    Transcribed from Graphophone record, and Harmonized by E.S. TRACY.    Ho Ha!  Is-te wa-ta si wi-ta ha,  Ha! Is-te wa-ta si wi-ta ha  Hah-ars hi re wa-ha-ki,  Ha! Is-te wa-ta si wi-ta ha.]          MUSIC IN INDIAN LIFE.      Music enveloped the Indian's individual and social life like an  atmosphere. There was no important personal experience where it did  not bear a part, nor any ceremonial where it was not essential to the  expression of religious feeling. The songs of a tribe were coextensive  with the life of the people.    This universal use of music was because of the belief that it was a  medium of communication between man and the unseen. The invisible  voice could reach the invisible power that permeates all nature,  animating all natural forms. As success depended upon help from this  mysterious power, in every avocation, in every undertaking, and in  every ceremonial, the Indian appealed to this power through song. When  a man went forth to hunt, that he might secure food and clothing for  his family, he sang songs to insure the assistance of the unseen power  in capturing the game. In like manner, when he confronted danger and  death, he sang that strength might be given him to meet his fate  unflinchingly. In gathering the healing herbs and in administering  them, song brought the required efficacy. When he planted, he sang,  in order that the seed might fructify and the harvest follow. In his  sports, in his games, when he wooed and when he mourned, song alike  gave zest to pleasure and brought solace to his suffering. In fact,  the Indian sang in every experience of life from his cradle to his  grave.    It would be a mistake to fancy that songs floated indiscriminately  about among the Indians, and could be picked up here and there by any  chance observer. Every song had originally its owner. It belonged  either to a society, secular or religious, to a certain clan or  political organization, to a particular rite or ceremony, or to some  individual.    Religious songs were known only to the priesthood; and, as music  constituted a medium between man and the unseen powers which  controlled his life, literal accuracy was important, otherwise the  path between the god and the man would not be straight, and the appeal  would miscarry.    In every tribe there were societies having a definite membership, with  initiatory rites and reciprocal duties. Each society had its peculiar  songs; and there were officials chosen from among the members because  of their good voices and retentive memories, to lead the singing and  to transmit with accuracy the stories and songs of the society, which  frequently preserved bits of tribal history. Fines were imposed upon  any member who sang incorrectly, while ridicule always and everywhere  followed a faulty rendering of a song.    The right to sing a song which belonged to an individual could be  purchased, the person buying the song being taught it by its owner.    These beliefs and customs among the Indians have made it possible to  preserve their songs without change from one generation to another.  Many curious and interesting proofs of accuracy of transmittal have  come to my knowledge during the past twenty years, while studying  these primitive melodies.    Indian singing was always in unison; and, as the natural soprano,  contralto, tenor, and bass moved along in octaves, the different  qualities of tone in the voices brought out the overtones and produced  harmonic effects. When listening to chorals sung by two or three  hundred voices, as I have many times heard them in ceremonials, it has  been difficult to realise that all were singing in unison.    Close and continued observation has revealed that the Indian, when he  sings, is not concerned with the making of a musical presentation to  his audience. He is simply pouring out his feelings, regardless of  artistic effects. To him music is subjective: it is the vehicle of  communication between him and the object of his desire.    Certain peculiarities in the Indian's mode of singing make it  difficult for one of our race to intelligently hear their songs or to  truthfully transcribe them.    There is no uniform key for any given song, for the Indians have no  mechanical device for determining pitch to create a standard by which  to train the ear. This, however, does not affect the song; for,  whatever the starting note, the intervals bear the same relation to  each other, so that the melody itself suffers no change with the  change of pitch.    Again, the continual slurring of the voice from one tone to another  produces upon us the impression of out-of-tune singing. Then, the  custom of singing out of doors, to the accompaniment of the drum, and  against the various noises of the camp, and the ever-restless wind,  tending to strain the voice and robbing it of sweetness, increases the  difficulty of distinguishing the music concealed within the noise,--a  difficulty still further aggravated by the habit of pulsating the  voice, creating a rhythm within the rhythm of the song.    Emotion also affects the rendering of Indian music. This is especially  noticeable in solos, as love-songs, where the singer quite  unconsciously varies from a quarter to a whole tone from the true  pitch. On the contrary, emphasis sharps the tone. If, however, these  peculiarities are imitated to him, the Indian immediately detects, and  declares them to be wrong, thus betraying his unconsciousness of his  own inaccuracies in endeavouring to strike a plain diatonic interval.
