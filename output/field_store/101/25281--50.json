And his  love for monks broke out in the song which he composed as he listened  to their chant at Ely: \"Merrily sang the monks in Ely when Cnut King  rowed by\" across the vast fen-waters that surrounded their Abbey.  \"Row, boatmen, near the land, and hear we these monks sing.\"[13]     \"'All hail!' the monks at Christmas sang;    The merry monks who kept with cheer    The gladdest day of all the year.\"[14]    It is said that Cnut, who is also called Canute, \"marked one of his  royal Christmases by a piece of sudden retributive justice: bored  beyond all endurance by the Saxon Edric's iteration of the traitorous  services he had rendered him, the King exclaimed to Edric, Earl of  Northumberland: 'Then let him receive his deserts, that he may not  betray us as he betrayed Ethelred and Edmund!' upon which the ready  Norwegian disposed of all fear on that score by cutting down the  boaster with his axe, and throwing his body into the Thames.\"[15]    In the year 1035, King Cnut died at Shaftesbury, and was buried in  Winchester Cathedral. His sons, Harold and Harthacnut, did not possess  the capacity for good government, otherwise the reign of the Danes  might have continued. As it was, their reigns, though short, were  troublesome. Harold died at Oxford in 1040, and was buried at  Westminster (being the first king who was buried there); Harthacnut  died at Lambeth at a wedding-feast in 1042, and was buried beside his  father in Winchester Cathedral. And thus ended the reigns of the  Danish kings of England.    Now we come to      THE REIGN OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR,    who, we are told, was heartily chosen by all the people, for the two  very good reasons, that he was an Englishman by birth, and the only  man of either the English or the Danish royal families who was at  hand. He was the son of Ethelred and Emma, and at the Christmas  festival of his coronation there was great rejoicing. As his early  training had been at the court of his uncle, Richard the Good, in  Normandy, he had learnt to prefer Norman-French customs and life to  those of the English. During his reign, therefore, he brought over  many strangers and appointed them to high ecclesiastical and other  offices, and Norman influence and refinement of manners gradually  increased at the English court, and this, of course, led to the more  stately celebration of the Christmas festival. The King himself, being  of a pious and meditative disposition, naturally took more interest in  the religious than the temporal rejoicings, and the administration of  state affairs was left almost entirely to members of the house of  Godwin during the principal part of his reign. Many disturbances  occurred during Edward's reign in different parts of the country,  especially on the Welsh border. At the Christmas meeting of the King  and his Wise Men, at Gloucester, in 1053, it was ordered that Rhys,  the brother of Gruffydd, the South Welsh king, be put to death for his  great plunder and mischief. The same year, the great Earl Godwine,  while dining with the king at Winchester at the Easter feast, suddenly  fell in a fit, died four days after, and was buried in the old  cathedral. A few years later (1065), the Northumbrians complained that  Earl Tostig, Harold's brother, had caused Gospatric, one of the chief  Thanes, to be treacherously murdered when he came to the King's court  the Christmas before. King Edward kept his last Christmas (1065), and  had the meeting of his Wise Men in London instead of Gloucester as  usual. His great object was to finish his new church at Westminster,  and to have it hallowed before he died. He lived just long enough to  have this done. On Innocent's Day the new Minster was consecrated, but  the King was too ill to be there, so the Lady Edith stood in his  stead. And on January 5, 1066, King Edward, the son of Ethelred, died.  On the morning of the day following his death, the body of the  Confessor was laid in the tomb, in his new church; and on the same  day--      HAROLD WAS CROWNED KING    in his stead. Thus three very important events--the consecration of  Westminster Abbey, the death of Edward the Confessor, and the crowning  of Harold--all occurred during the same Christmas festival.    In the terrible year 1066 England had three kings. The reign of  Harold, the son of Godwine, who succeeded Edward the Confessor,  terminated at the battle of Senlac, or Hastings, and on the following      CHRISTMAS DAY WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WAS CROWNED KING    by Archbishop Ealdred. He had not at that time conquered all the land,  and it was a long while before he really possessed the whole of it.  Still, he was the king, chosen, crowned, and anointed, and no one ever  was able to drive him out of the land, and the crown of England has  ever since been held by his descendants.

Now we come to the      CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS UNDER THE NORMANS.    [Illustration: A KING AT DINNER.]    Lord Macaulay says \"the polite luxury of the Normans presented a  striking contrast to the coarse voracity and drunkenness of their  Saxon and Danish neighbours.\" And certainly the above example of a  royal dinner scene (from a manuscript of the fourteenth century) gives  an idea of stately ceremony which is not found in any manuscripts  previous to the coming over of the Normans. They \"loved to display  their magnificence, not in huge piles of food and hogsheads of strong  drink, but in large and stately edifices, rich armour, gallant horses,  choice falcons, well-ordered tournaments, banquets delicate rather  than abundant, and wines remarkable rather for their exquisite flavour  than for their intoxicating power.\" Quite so. But even the Normans  were not all temperate. And, while it is quite true that the refined  manners and chivalrous spirit of the Normans exercised a powerful  influence on the Anglo-Saxons, it is equally true that the conquerors  on mingling with the English people adopted many of the ancient  customs to which they tenaciously clung, and these included the  customs of Christmastide.    The Norman kings and nobles displayed their taste for magnificence in  the most remarkable manner at their coronations, tournaments, and  their celebrations of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide. The great  councils of the Norman reigns which assembled at Christmas and the  other great festivals, were in appearance a continuation of the  Witenagemots, but the power of the barons became very formal in the  presence of such despotic monarchs as William the Conqueror and his  sons. At the Christmas festival all the prelates and nobles of the  kingdom were, by their tenures, obliged to attend their sovereign to  assist in the administration of justice and in deliberation on the  great affairs of the kingdom. On these occasions the King wore his  crown, and feasted his nobles in the great hall of his palace, and  made them presents as marks of his royal favour, after which they  proceeded to the consideration of State affairs. Wherever the Court  happened to be, there was usually a large assemblage of gleemen, who  were jugglers and pantomimists as well as minstrels, and were  accustomed to associate themselves in companies, and amuse the  spectators with feats of strength and agility, dancing, tumbling, and  sleight-of-hand tricks, as well as musical performances. Among the  minstrels who came into England with William the Conqueror was one  named Taillefer, who was present at the battle of Hastings, and rode  in front of the Norman army, inspiriting the soldiers by his songs. He  sang of Roland, the heroic captain of Charlemagne, tossing his sword  in the air and catching it again as he approached the English line. He  was the first to strike a blow at the English, but after mortally  wounding one or two of King Harold's warriors, he was himself struck  down.    At the Christmas feast minstrels played on various musical instruments  during dinner, and sang or told tales afterwards, both in the hall and  in the chamber to which the king and his nobles retired for amusement.  Thus it is written of a court minstrel:--     \"Before the King he set him down    And took his harp of merry soun,    And, as he full well can,    Many merry notes he began.    The king beheld, and sat full still,    To hear his harping he had good will.    When he left off his harping,    To him said that rich king,    Minstrel, we liketh well thy glee,    What thing that thou ask of me    Largely I will thee pay;    Therefore ask now and asay.\" (_Sir Orpheo._)    [Illustration: BLIND MINSTREL AT A FEAST.]    After the Conquest the first entertainments given by William the  Conqueror were those to his victorious warriors:--     \"Every warrior's manly neck    Chains of regal honour deck,    Wreathed in many a golden link:    From the golden cup they drink    Nectar that the bees produce,    Or the grape's extatic juice.    Flush'd with mirth and hope they burn.\"      _The Gododin._    In 1067 the Conqueror kept a grand Christmas in London. He had spent  eight months of that year rewarding his warriors and gratifying his  subjects in Normandy, where he had held a round of feasts and made a  grand display of the valuable booty which he had won by his sword. A  part of his plunder he sent to the Pope along with the banner of  Harold. Another portion, consisting of"]]]
