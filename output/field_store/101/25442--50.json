But in the Lords there was a conflict of which the  event for a time seemed doubtful. At length the influence of the  Court, strenuously exerted, carried an Act by which the chimney tax was  declared a badge of slavery, and was, with many expressions of gratitude  to the King, abolished for ever. [40]    The Commons granted, with little dispute, and without a division,  six hundred thousand pounds for the purpose of repaying to the United  Provinces the charges of the expedition which had delivered England. The  facility with which this large sum was voted to a shrewd, diligent and  thrifty people, our allies, indeed, politically, but commercially our  most formidable rivals, excited some murmurs out of doors, and  was, during many years, a favourite subject of sarcasm with Tory  pamphleteers. [41] The liberality of the House admits however of an  easy explanation. On the very day on which the subject was under  consideration, alarming news arrived at Westminster, and convinced many,  who would at another time have been disposed to scrutinise severely any  account sent in by the Dutch, that our country could not yet dispense  with the services of the foreign troops.    France had declared war against the States General; and the States  General had consequently demanded from the King of England those  succours which he was bound by the treaty of Nimeguen to furnish. [42]  He had ordered some battalions to march to Harwich, that they might be  in readiness to cross to the Continent. The old soldiers of James  were generally in a very bad temper; and this order did not produce a  soothing effect. The discontent was greatest in the regiment which now  ranks as first of the line. Though borne on the English establishment,  that regiment, from the time when it first fought under the great  Gustavus, had been almost exclusively composed of Scotchmen; and  Scotchmen have never, in any region to which their adventurous and  aspiring temper has led them, failed to note and to resent every slight  offered to Scotland. Officers and men muttered that a vote of a foreign  assembly was nothing to them. If they could be absolved from their  allegiance to King James the Seventh, it must be by the Estates at  Edinburgh, and not by the Convention at Westminster. Their ill humour  increased when they heard that Schomberg had been appointed their  colonel. They ought perhaps to have thought it an honour to be called by  the name of the greatest soldier in Europe. But, brave and skilful as  he was, he was not their countryman: and their regiment, during the  fifty-six years which had elapsed since it gained its first honourable  distinctions in Germany, had never been commanded but by a Hepburn or a  Douglas. While they were in this angry and punctilious mood, they were  ordered to join the forces which were assembling at Harwich. There was  much murmuring; but there was no outbreak till the regiment arrived at  Ipswich. There the signal of revolt was given by two captains who were  zealous for the exiled King. The market place was soon filled with  pikemen and musketeers running to and fro. Gunshots were wildly fired  in all directions. Those officers who attempted to restrain the rioters  were overpowered and disarmed. At length the chiefs of the insurrection  established some order, and marched out of Ipswich at the head of their  adherents. The little army consisted of about eight hundred men. They  had seized four pieces of cannon, and had taken possession of the  military chest, which contained a considerable sum of money. At the  distance of half a mile from the town a halt was called: a general  consultation was held; and the mutineers resolved that they would hasten  back to their native country, and would live and die with their rightful  King. They instantly proceeded northward by forced marches. [43]    When the news reached London the dismay was great. It was rumoured that  alarming symptoms had appeared in other regiments, and particularly  that a body of fusileers which lay at Harwich was likely to imitate the  example set at Ipswich. \"If these Scots,\" said Halifax to Reresby,  \"are unsupported, they are lost. But if they have acted in concert with  others, the danger is serious indeed.\" [44] The truth seems to be that  there was a conspiracy which had ramifications in many parts of the  army, but that the conspirators were awed by the firmness of the  government and of the Parliament. A committee of the Privy Council  was sitting when the tidings of the mutiny arrived in London. William  Harbord, who represented the borough of Launceston, was at the board.  His colleagues entreated him to go down instantly to the House of  Commons, and to relate what had happened. He went, rose in his place,  and told his story. The spirit of the assembly rose to the occasion.  Howe was the first to call for vigorous action. \"Address the King,\" he  said, \"to send his Dutch troops after these men. I know not who else can  be trusted.\" \"This is no jesting matter,\" said old Birch, who had been a  colonel in the service of the Parliament, and had seen the most powerful  and renowned House of Commons that ever sate twice purged and twice  expelled by its own soldiers; \"if you let this evil spread, you will  have an army upon you in a few days. Address the King to send horse and  foot instantly, his own men, men whom he can trust, and to put these  people down at once.\" The men of the long robe caught the flame. \"It  is not the learning of my profession that is needed here,\" said Treby.  \"What is now to be done is to meet force with force, and to maintain  in the field what we have done in the senate.\" \"Write to the Sheriffs,\"  said Colonel Mildmay, member for Essex. \"Raise the militia. There are a  hundred and fifty thousand of them: they are good Englishmen: they will  not fail you.\" It was resolved that all members of the House who  held commissions in the army should be dispensed from parliamentary  attendance, in order that they might repair instantly to their military  posts. An address was unanimously voted requesting the King to take  effectual steps for the suppression of the rebellion, and to put forth  a proclamation denouncing public vengeance on the rebels. One gentleman  hinted that it might be well to advise his Majesty to offer a pardon  to those who should peaceably submit: but the House wisely rejected the  suggestion. \"This is no time,\" it was well said, \"for any thing that  looks like fear.\" The address was instantly sent up to the Lords.  The Lords concurred in it. Two peers, two knights of shires, and two  burgesses were sent with it to Court. William received them graciously,  and informed them that he had already given the necessary orders. In  fact, several regiments of horse and dragoons had been sent northward  under the command of Ginkell, one of the bravest and ablest officers of  the Dutch army. [45]    Meanwhile the mutineers were hastening across the country which lies  between Cambridge and the Wash. Their road lay through a vast and  desolate fen, saturated with all the moisture of thirteen counties, and  overhung during the greater part of the year by a low grey mist, high  above which rose, visible many miles, the magnificent tower of Ely. In  that dreary region, covered by vast flights of wild fowl, a half savage  population, known by the name of the Breedlings, then led an amphibious  life, sometimes wading, and sometimes rowing, from one islet of firm  ground to another. [46] The roads were amongst the worst in the island,  and, as soon as rumour announced the approach of the rebels, were  studiously made worse by the country people. Bridges were broken down.  Trees were laid across the highways to obstruct the progress of the  cannon. Nevertheless the Scotch veterans not only pushed forward with  great speed, but succeeded in carrying their artillery with them. They  entered Lincolnshire, and were not far from Sleaford, when they learned  that Ginkell with an irresistible force was close on their track.  Victory and escape were equally out of the question. The bravest  warriors could not contend against fourfold odds. The most active  infantry could not outrun horsemen. Yet the leaders, probably despairing  of pardon, urged the men to try the chance of battle. In that region, a  spot almost surrounded by swamps and pools was without difficulty found.  Here the insurgents were drawn up; and the cannon were planted at the  only point which was thought not to be sufficiently protected by natural  defences. Ginkell ordered the attack to be made at a place which was  out of the range of the guns; and his dragoons dashed gallantly into the  water, though it was so deep that their horses were forced to swim. Then  the mutineers lost heart. They beat a parley, surrendered at discretion,  and were brought up to London under a strong guard. Their lives were  forfeit: for they had been guilty, not merely of mutiny, which was  then not a legal crime, but of levying war against the King. William,  however, with politic clemency, abstained from shedding the blood even  of the most culpable. A few of the ringleaders were brought to trial  at the next Bury assizes, and were convicted of high treason; but their  lives were spared. The rest were merely ordered to return to their duty.  The regiment, lately so refractory, went submissively to the Continent,  and there, through many hard campaigns, distinguished itself by  fidelity, by discipline, and by valour. [47]    This event facilitated an important change in our polity, a change  which, it is true, could not have been long delayed, but which would not  have been easily accomplished except at a moment of extreme danger. The  time had at length arrived at which it was necessary to make a legal  distinction between the soldier and the citizen. Under the Plantagenets  and the Tudors there had been no standing army. The standing army"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2613"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 4 (#9)"],[1,"which he never regretted the sacrifice which he had made  to what he thought his duty, and yet constantly became more and more  indulgent to those whose views of duty differed from his. [53]    Sancroft was of a very different temper. He had, indeed, as little to  complain of as any man whom a revolution has ever hurled down from an  exalted station. He had at Fressingfield, in Suffolk, a patrimonial  estate, which, together with what he had saved during a primacy of  twelve years, enabled him to live, not indeed as he had lived when he  was the first peer of Parliament, but in the style of an opulent country  gentleman. He retired to his hereditary abode; and there he passed  the rest of his life in brooding over his wrongs. Aversion to the  Established Church became as strong a feeling in him as it had been in  Martin Marprelate. He considered all who remained in communion with her  as heathens and publicans. He nicknamed Tillotson the Mufti. In the room  which was used as a chapel at Fressingfield no person who had taken  the oaths, or who attended the ministry of any divine who had taken  the oaths, was suffered to partake of the sacred bread and wine. A  distinction, however, was made between two classes of offenders. A  layman who remained in communion with the Church was permitted to be  present while prayers were read, and was excluded only from the highest  of Christian mysteries. But with clergymen who had sworn allegiance to  the Sovereigns in possession Sancroft would not even pray. He took care  that the rule which he had laid down should be widely known, and, both  by precept and by example, taught his followers to look on the most  orthodox, the most devout, the most virtuous of those who acknowledged  William's authority with a feeling similar to that with which the  Jew regarded the Samaritan. [54] Such intolerance would have been  reprehensible, even in a man contending for a great principle. But  Sancroft was contending merely for a name. He was the author of the  scheme of Regency. He was perfectly willing to transfer the whole kingly  power from James to William. The question which, to this smallest and  sourest of minds, seemed important enough to justify the excommunicating  of ten thousand priests and of five millions of laymen was, whether the  magistrate to whom the whole kingly power was transferred should assume  the kingly title. Nor could Sancroft bear to think that the animosity  which he had excited would die with himself. Having done all that he  could to make the feud bitter, he determined to make it eternal. A list  of the divines who had been ejected from their benefices was sent by him  to Saint Germains with a request that James would nominate two who might  keep up the episcopal succession. James, well pleased, doubtless, to see  another sect added to that multitude of sects which he had been taught  to consider as the reproach of Protestantism, named two fierce and  uncompromising nonjurors, Hickes and Wagstaffe, the former recommended  by Sancroft, the latter recommended by Lloyd, the ejected Bishop of  Norwich. [55] Such was the origin of a schismatical hierarchy, which,  having, during a short time, excited alarm, soon sank into obscurity and  contempt, but which, in obscurity and contempt, continued to drag on a  languid existence during several generations. The little Church, without  temples, revenues or dignities, was even more distracted by internal  disputes than the great Church, which retained possession of cathedrals,  tithes and peerages. Some nonjurors leaned towards the ceremonial of  Rome; others would not tolerate the slightest departure from the Book  of Common Prayer. Altar was set up against altar. One phantom prelate  pronounced the consecration of another phantom prelate uncanonical. At  length the pastors were left absolutely without flocks. One of these  Lords spiritual very wisely turned surgeon; another left what he had  called his see, and settled in Ireland; and at length, in 1805, the last  Bishop of that society which had proudly claimed to be the only true  Church of England dropped unnoticed into the grave. [56]    The places of the bishops who had been ejected with Sancroft were filled  in a manner creditable to the government. Patrick succeeded the traitor  Turner. Fowler went to Gloucester. Richard Cumberland, an aged divine,  who had no interest at Court, and whose only recommendations were his  piety and erudition, was astonished by learning from a newsletter which  he found on the table of a coffeehouse that he had been nominated to  the See of Peterborough. [57] Beveridge was selected to succeed Ken;  he consented; and the appointment was actually announced in the London  Gazette. But Beveridge, though an honest, was not a strongminded man.  Some Jacobites expostulated with him; some reviled him; his heart  failed him; and he retracted. While the nonjurors were rejoicing in  this victory, he changed his mind again; but too late. He had by his  irresolution forfeited the favour of William, and never obtained a mitre  till Anne was on the throne. [58] The bishopric of Bath and Wells  was bestowed on Richard Kidder, a man of considerable attainments and  blameless character, but suspected of a leaning towards Presbyterianism.  About the same time Sharp, the highest churchman that had been zealous  for the Comprehension, and the lowest churchman that felt a scruple  about succeeding a deprived prelate, accepted the Archbishopric of York,  vacant by the death of Lamplugh. [59]    In consequence of the elevation of Tillotson to the See of Canterbury,  the Deanery of Saint Paul's became vacant. As soon as the name of  the new Dean was known, a clamour broke forth such as perhaps no  ecclesiastical appointment has ever produced, a clamour made up of yells  of hatred, of hisses of contempt, and of shouts of triumphant and half  insulting welcome; for the new Dean was William Sherlock.    The story of his conversion deserves to be fully told; for it throws  great light on the character of the parties which then divided the  Church and the State. Sherlock was, in influence and reputation, though  not in rank, the foremost man among the nonjurors. His authority and  example had induced some of his brethren, who had at first wavered,  to resign their benefices. The day of suspension came; the day of  deprivation came; and still he was firm. He seemed to have found, in the  consciousness of rectitude, and in meditation on the invisible world,  ample compensation for all his losses. While excluded from the pulpit  where his eloquence had once delighted the learned and polite inmates  of the Temple, he wrote that celebrated Treatise on Death which, during  many years, stood next to the Whole Duty of Man in the bookcases of  serious Arminians. Soon, however, it began to be suspected that his  resolution was giving way. He declared that he would be no party to  a schism; he advised those who sought his counsel not to leave their  parish churches; nay, finding that the law which had ejected him from  his cure did not interdict him from performing divine service, he  officiated at Saint Dunstan's, and there prayed for King William and  Queen Mary. The apostolical injunction, he said, was that prayers should  be made for all in authority, and William and Mary were visibly in  authority. His Jacobite friends loudly blamed his inconsistency. How,  they asked, if you admit that the Apostle speaks in this passage of  actual authority, can you maintain that, in other passages of a similar  kind, he speaks only of legitimate authority? Or how can you, without  sin, designate as King, in a solemn address to God, one whom you  cannot, without sin, promise to obey as King? These reasonings were  unanswerable; and Sherlock soon began to think them so; but the  conclusion to which they led him was diametrically opposed to the  conclusion to which they were meant to lead him. He hesitated, however,  till a new light flashed on his mind from a quarter from which there was  little reason to expect any thing but tenfold darkness. In the reign of  James the First, Doctor John Overall, Bishop of Exeter, had written an  elaborate treatise on the rights of civil and ecclesiastical governors.  This treatise had been solemnly approved by the Convocations  of Canterbury and York, and might therefore be considered as an  authoritative exposition of the doctrine of the Church of England. A  copy of the manuscript was in Sancroft's possession; and he, soon after  the Revolution, sent it to the press. He hoped, doubtless, that the  publication would injure the new government; but he was lamentably  disappointed. The book indeed condemned all resistance in terms as  strong as he could himself have used; but one passage which had escaped  his notice was decisive against himself and his fellow schismatics.  Overall, and the two Convocations which had given their sanction to  Overall's teaching, pronounced that a government, which had originated  in rebellion, ought, when thoroughly settled, to be considered as  ordained by God and to be obeyed by Christian men. [60] Sherlock read,  and was convinced. His venerable mother the Church had spoken; and he,  with the docility of a child, accepted her decree. The government which  had sprung from the Revolution might, at least since the battle of the  Boyne and the flight of James from Ireland, be fairly called a settled  government, and ought therefore to be passively obeyed till it should  be subverted by another revolution and succeeded by another settled  government.    Sherlock took the oaths, and speedily published, in justification of his  conduct, a pamphlet entitled The Case of Allegiance to Sovereign Powers  stated. The sensation produced by this work was immense. Dryden's Hind  and Panther had not raised so great an uproar. Halifax's Letter to  a Dissenter had not called forth so many answers. The replies to the  Doctor,"]]]
