Everything grew out of the Anglo-Saxon laws and customs.    [Illustration: ECCLESIASTICAL COSTUME IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY.]    By his loud praise of the great plenty of food of every kind which could  be found in London, FitzStephen reminds us that he has lived in other  towns, and especially in Canterbury, when he was in the service of the  Archbishop. We see, though he does not mention it, the comparison in his  mind between the plentiful market of London and the meagre market of  Canterbury. Everything, he says, was on sale. All the roasted meats and  boiled that one can ask for; all the fish, poultry, and game in season,  could every day be bought in London: there were cookshops where dinners  and suppers could be had by paying for them. He dwells at length upon  this abundance. Now in the country towns and the villages the supplies  were a matter of uncertainty and anxiety: a housewife had to keep her  pantry and her larder well victualled in advance: salt meat and salt  fish were the staple of food. Beef and mutton were scarce: game there  was in plenty if it could be taken; but game laws were strict; very  little venison would find its way into Canterbury market. To this cleric  who knew the country markets, the profusion of everything in London was  amazing.    Another thing he notices--'Nearly all the Bishops, Abbots, and Magnates  of England are, as it were, citizens and freemen of London; having their  own splendid houses to which they resort, where they spend largely when  summoned to great Councils by the King, or by their Metropolitan, or  drawn thither by their own private affairs.'    In another century or two London will become, as you shall see, a City  of Palaces. Observe that the palaces are already beginning. Observe,  also, that London is already being enriched by the visits and residence  of great lords who, with their retinues, spend 'largely.' Down to the  present day the same thing has always gone on. The wealthy people who  have their town houses in the West End of London and the thousands of  country people and foreigners who now flock to the London hotels are the  successors of the great men and their following who came up to London in  the twelfth century and spent 'largely.'    'I do not think,' says FitzStephen, 'that there is any city with more  commendable customs of church attendance, honour to God's ordinances,  keeping sacred festivals, almsgiving, hospitality, confirming,  betrothals, contracting marriages, celebration of nuptials, preparing  feasts, cheering the guests, and also in care for funerals and the  interment of the dead. The only pests of London are the immoderate  drinking of fools and the frequency of fires.'          15. LONDON BRIDGE.    PART I.      Nobody knows who built the first Bridge. It was there in the fourth  century--a bridge of timber provided with a fortified gate, one of the  gates of the City. Who put it up, and when--how long it stood--what  space there was between the piers--how broad it was--we do not know.  Probably it was quite a narrow bridge consisting of beams laid across  side by side and a railing at the side. That these beams were not close  together is known by the fact that so many coins have been found in the  bed of the river beneath the old Bridge.    [Illustration: ROYAL ARMS OF ENGLAND FROM RICHARD I. TO EDWARD III.    (_From the wall arcade, south aisle of nave, Westminster Abbey._)]    Besides the Bridge there were ferries across the river, especially  between Dowgate and the opposite bank called St. Mary Overies Dock,  where was afterwards erected St. Mary Overies Priory, to which belonged  the church now called St. Saviour's, Southwark. The docks at either end  of the old ferry still remain.    The Bridge had many misfortunes: it is said to have been destroyed by  the Danes in 1013. Perhaps for 'destruction' we should read 'damage.' It  was, however, certainly burned down in the Great Fire of 1136. Another,  also of wood, was built in its place and, in the year 1176, a bridge of  stone was commenced, which took thirty years to build and remained  standing till the year 1831, when the present Bridge was completed and  the old one pulled down.    The Architect of this stone Bridge, destined to stand for six hundred  and fifty years, was one Peter, Chaplain of St. Mary Colechurch in the  Old Jewry (the church was destroyed in the Great Fire and not rebuilt).    Now the building of bridges was regarded, at this time, as a work of  piety. If we consider how a bridge helps the people we shall agree with  our forefathers. Without a bridge, those living on one side of a river  can only carry on intercourse with those on the other side by means of  boats. Merchants cannot carry their wares about: farmers cannot get  their produce to market: wayfarers can only get across by ferry: armies  cannot march--if you wish to follow an army across a country where there  are no bridges you must look for fords. Roads are useless unless bridges  cross the rivers. The first essential to the union of a nation is the  possibility of intercommunication: without roads and bridges the man of  Devon is a stranger and an enemy to the man of Somerset. We who have  bridges over every river: who need never even ford a stream: who hardly  know what a ferry means: easily forget that these bridges did not grow  like the oaks and the elms: but were built after long study of the  subject by men who were trained for the work just as other men were  trained and taught to build cathedrals and churches. A religious order  was founded in France in the twelfth century: it was called the Order of  the 'Pontife' Brethren--_Pontife_ is Pontifex--that is--Bridge Builder.  The Bridge Building Brothers constructed many bridges in France of  which several still remain. It is not certain that Peter of Colechurch  was one of this Brotherhood, perhaps not. When he died, in 1205, before  the Bridge was completed, King John called over a French 'Pontife' named  Isembert who had built bridges at La Rochelle and Saintes. But the  principal builders are said to have been three merchants of London named  Serle Mercer, William Almain, and Benedict Botewrite. The building of  the Bridge was regarded as a national work: the King: the great Lords:  the Bishops: as well as the London Citizens, gave money to hasten its  completion. The list of donors was preserved on 'a table fair written  for posterity' in the Chapel on the Bridge. It was unhappily destroyed  in the Great Fire.    It must not be supposed that the Bridge of Peter Colechurch was like the  present stately Bridge of broad arches. It contained twenty arches of  irregular breadth: only two or three being the same: they varied from 10  feet to 32 feet: some of them therefore were very narrow: the piers were  also of different lengths. These irregularities were certainly  intentional and were based upon some observations on the rise and fall  of the tide. No other great Bridge had yet been constructed across a  tidal river.    When the Bridge was built it was thought necessary to consecrate it to  some saint. The latest saint, St. Thomas Becket, was chosen as the  titular saint of this Bridge. A chapel, dedicated to him, was built in  the centre pier of the Bridge: it was, in fact, a double chapel: in the  lower part, the crypt, was buried Peter of Colechurch himself: the upper  part, which escaped the Great Fire, became, after the Reformation, a  warehouse.          16. LONDON BRIDGE.    PART II.      Houses were erected in course of time along the Bridge on either side  like a street, but with intervals; and along the roadway in the middle  were chain posts to protect the passengers. As the Bridge was only 40  feet wide the houses must have been small. But they were built out at  the back overhanging the river, and the roadway itself was not intended  for carts or wheeled vehicles. Remember that everything was brought to  the City on pack horse or pack ass. The table of Tolls sanctioned by  King Edward I. makes no mention of cart or waggon at all. Men on  horseback and loaded horses can get along with a very narrow road.  Perhaps we may allow twelve feet for the road which gives for the houses  on either side a depth of 14 feet each.    [Illustration: OLD LONDON BRIDGE.]    These houses were occupied chiefly by shops, most of which were  'haberdashers and traders in small wares.' Later on there were many  booksellers. Paper merchants and stationers, after the Reformation,  occupied the chapel. The great painter Hans Holbein lived on the Bridge  and the two marine painters Peter Monamy and Dominic Serres also lived  here.    The narrowness of the arches and the rush of the flowing or the ebbing  tide made the 'shooting' of the Bridge a matter of great danger. The  Duke of Norfolk in 1429 was thrown into the water by the capsizing of  his boat and narrowly escaped with his life. Queen Henrietta, in 1628,  was nearly wrecked in the same way by running into the piers while  shooting the Bridge. Rubens the painter was thrown into the water in the  same way.    One of the twenty arches formed a drawbridge which allowed vessels of  larger size than barges to pass up the river and could be used to keep  back an enemy. In this way Sir Thomas Wyatt in 1557 was kept out of  London. Before this drawbridge stood a tower on the battlements of which  were placed the heads of traitors and criminals. The heads of Sir  William Wallace, Jack Cade, Sir Thomas More and many others were stuck  up here. On the Southwark side was another tower.    The Bridge, which was the pride and boast of London, was endowed with  lands for its maintenance: the rents of the houses were also collected  for the same purpose: a toll was imposed on all merchandise carried  across, and a Brotherhood was formed, called the Brothers of St. Thomas  on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2800"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#9)"],[1,"1 Lit. who blow on knots.

SURA I.1 [VIII.]    MECCA.-7 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    PRAISE be to God, Lord of the worlds!    The compassionate, the merciful!    King on the day of reckoning!    Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.    Guide Thou us on the straight path,2    The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious;-with whom thou art not  angry, and who go not astray.3      _______________________    1 This Sura, which Nöldeke places last, and Muir sixth, in the earliest class  of Meccan Suras, must at least have been composed prior to Sura xxxvii.  182,where it is quoted, and to Sura xv. 87, which refers to it. And it can  scarcely be an accidental circumstance that the words of the first, second,  and fifth verses do not occur in any other Suras of the first Meccan period  as given by Nldeke, but frequently in those of the second, which it  therefore, in Nldeke, opinion, immediately precedes. But this may be  accounted for by its having been recast for the purposes of private and  public devotion by Muhammad himself, which is the meaning probably of the  Muhammadan tradition that it was revealed twice.  It should also be observed  that, including the auspicatory formula, there are the same number of  petitions in this Sura as in the Lord's Prayer. It is recited several times  in each of the five daily prayers, and on many other occassions, as in  concluding a bargain, etc. It is termed \"the Opening of the Book,\" \"the  Completion,\" \"the Sufficing Sura,\" the Sura of Praise, Thanks, and Prayer,\"  \"the Healer,\" \"the Remedy,\" \"the Basis,\" \"the Treasure,\" \"the Mother of the  Book,\" \"the Seven Verses of Repetition.\" The Muhammadans always say \"Amen\"  after this prayer, Muhammad having been instructed, says the Sonna, to do so  by the Angel Gabriel.    2 Islam    3 The following transfer of this Sura from the Arabic into the corresponding  English characters may give some idea of the rhyming prose in which the Koran  is written:    Bismillahi 'rahhmani 'rrahheem.  El-hamdoo lillahi rabi 'lalameen.  Arrahhmani raheem.  Maliki yowmi-d-deen.  Eyaka naboodoo, wayaka nest aeen.  Ihdina 'ssirat almostakeem.

To you be your religion; to me my religion.1      _______________________    1 This Sura is said to have been revealed when Walîd urged Muhammad to  consent that his God should be worshipped at the same time with the old  Meccan deities, or alternately every year. Hishâmi, p. 79; Tabari, p. 139. It  is a distinct renunciation of Meccan idolatry, as the following Sura is a  distinct recognition of the Divine Unity.      SURA CXII.-THE UNITY [X.]    MECCA.-4 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    SAY: He is God alone:    God the eternal!

His wealth and his gains shall avail him not.    Burned shall he be at the fiery flame,2    And his wife laden with fire wood,-    On her neck a rope of palm fibre.      _______________________    1 Undoubtedly one of the earliest Suras, and refers to the rejection of  Muhammad's claim to the prophetic office by his uncle, Abu Lahab, at the  instigation of his wife, Omm Djemil, who is said to have strewn the path of  Muhammad on one occasion with thorns. The following six Suras, like the two  first, have special reference to the difficulties which the Prophet met with  the outset of his career, especially from the rich.    2 In allusion to the meaning of Abu Lahab, father of flame.

Nay! for verily he shall be flung into the Crushing Fire;    And who shall teach thee what the Crushing Fire is?    It is God's kindled fire,    Which shall mount above the hearts of the damned;    It shall verily rise over them like a vault,    On outstretched columns.      SURA CVII.-RELIGION [XIV.]    MECCA.-7 Verses    In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    WHAT thinkest thou of him who treateth our RELIGION as a lie?    He it is who trusteth away the orphan,    And stirreth not others up to feed the poor.    Woe to those who pray,    But in their prayer are careless;    Who make a shew of devotion,    But refuse help to the needy.      SURA CII.-DESIRE [XV.]    MECCA.-8 Verses    In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    THE DESIRE of increasing riches occupieth you,    Till ye come to the grave.    Nay! but in the end ye shall know    Nay! once more,in the end ye shall know your folly.    Nay! would that ye knew it with knowledge of certainty!    Surely ye shall see hell-fire.    Then shall ye surely see it with the eye of certainty;    Then shall ye on that day be taken to task concerning pleasures.      SURA XCII.-THE NIGHT [XVI.]    MECCA.-21 Verses    In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    BY the NIGHT when she spreads her veil;    By the Day when it brightly shineth;    By Him who made male and female;    At different ends truly do ye aim!1    But as to him who giveth alms and feareth God,    And yieldeth assent to the Good;    To him will we make easy the path to happiness.    But as to him who is covetous and bent on riches,    And calleth the Good a lie,    To him will we make easy the path to misery:    And what shall his wealth avail him when he goeth down?    Truly mans guidance is with Us    And Ours, the Future and the Past.    I warn you therefore of the flaming fire;    None shall be cast to it but the most wretched,-    Who hath called the truth a lie and turned his back.    But the God-fearing shall escape it,-    Who giveth away his substance that he may become pure;2    And who offereth not favours to any one for the sake of recompense,    But only as seeking the face of his Lord the Most High.    And surely in the end he shall be well content.      _______________________    1  See Pref., p. 5, line I.  2  Comp. Luke xi. 41.  Muhammad perhaps derived this view of the meritorious  anture of almsgiving from the Jewish oral law.      SURA LXVIII.-THE PEN [XVII.]    Mecca.-52 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    Nun.1 By the PEN2 and by what they write,    Thou, O Prophet; by the grace of thy Lord art not possessed!3    And truly a boundless recompense doth await thee,    For thou art of a noble nature.4    But thou shalt see and they shall see Which of you is the demented.    Now thy Lord! well knoweth He the man who erreth from his path, and well doth  he know those who have yielded to Guidance;    Give not place, therefore, to those who treat thee as a liar:    They desire thee to deal smoothly with them: then would they be smooth as oil  with thee:    But yield not to the man of oaths, a despicable person,    Defamer, going about with slander,    Hinderer of the good, transgressor, criminal,    Harsh-beside this, impure by birth,    Though a man of riches and blessed with sons.    Who when our wondrous verses are recited to him saith-\"Fables of the  ancients.\"    We will brand him on the nostrils.    Verily, we have proved them (the Meccans) as we proved the owners of the  garden, when they swore that at morn they would cut its fruits;    But added no reserve.5    Wherefore an encircling desolation from thy Lord swept round it while they  slumbered,    And in the morning it was like a garden whose fruits had all been cut.    Then at dawn they called to each other,    \"Go out early to your field, if ye would cut your dates.\"    So on they went whispering to each other,    \"No poor man shall set foot this day within your garden;\"    And they went out at daybreak with this settled purpose.    But when they beheld it, they said, \"Truly we have been in fault:    Yes! we are forbidden our fruits.\"    The most rightminded of them said, \"Did I not say to you, Will ye not give  praise to God?\"    They said, \"Glory to our Lord! Truly we have done amiss.\"    And they fell to blaming one another:    They said, \"Oh woe to us! we have indeed transgressed!    Haply our Lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this: verily we  crave"]]]
