Looking back we see this spiral  gradually coiling in and in, until in a retrospect of millions of  years, instead of its distance from the earth being 240,000 miles, it  must have been much less. There was a time when the moon was only  200,000 miles away; there was a time many millions of years ago, when  the moon was only 100,000 miles away. Nor can we here stop our  retrospect; we must look further and further back, and follow the  moon's spiral path as it creeps in and in towards the earth, until at  last it appears actually in contact with that great globe of ours,  from which it is now separated by a quarter of a million of miles.    Surely the tides have thus led us to the knowledge of an astounding  epoch in our earth's past history, when the earth is spinning round in  a few hours, and when the moon is, practically speaking, in contact  with it. Perhaps I should rather say, that the materials of our  present moon were in this situation, for we would hardly be entitled  to assume that the moon then possessed the same globular form in which  we see it now. To form a just apprehension of the true nature of both  bodies at this critical epoch, we must study their concurrent history  as it is disclosed to us by a totally different line of reasoning.    Drop, then, for a moment all thought of tides, and let us bring to our  aid the laws of heat, which will disclose certain facts in the ancient  history of the earth-moon system perhaps as astounding as those to  which the tides have conducted us. In one respect we may compare these  laws of heat with the laws of the tides; they are both alike  non-periodic, their effects are cumulative from age to age, and  imagination can hardly even impose a limit to the magnificence of the  works they can accomplish. Our argument from heat is founded on a  very simple matter. It is quite obvious that a heated body tends to  grow cold. I am not now speaking of fires or of actual combustion  whereby heat is produced; I am speaking merely of such heat as would  be possessed by a red-hot poker after being taken from the fire, or by  an iron casting after the metal has been run into the mould. In such  cases as this the general law holds good, that the heated body tends  to grow cold. The cooling may be retarded no doubt if the passage of  heat from the body is impeded. We can, for instance, retard the  cooling of a teapot by the well-known practice of putting a cosy upon  it; but the law remains that, slowly or quickly, the heated body will  tend to grow colder. It seems almost puerile to insist with any  emphasis on a point so obvious as this, but yet I frequently find that  people do not readily apprehend all the gigantic consequences that can  flow from a principle so simple. It is true that a poker cools when  taken from the fire; we also find that a gigantic casting weighing  many tons will grow gradually cold, though it may require days to do  so. The same principle will extend to any object, no matter how vast  it may happen to be. Were that great casting 2000 miles in diameter,  or were it 8000 miles in diameter, it will still steadily part with  its heat, though no doubt the process of cooling becomes greatly  prolonged with an increase in the dimensions of the heated body. The  earth and the moon cannot escape from the application of these simple  principles.    Let us first speak of the earth. There are multitudes of volcanoes in  action at the present moment in various countries upon this earth. Now  whatever explanation may be given of the approximate cause of the  volcanic phenomena, there can be no doubt that they indicate the  existence of heat in the interior of the earth. It may possibly be, as  some have urged, that the volcanoes are merely vents for comparatively  small masses of subterranean molten matter; it may be, as others more  reasonably, in my opinion, believe, that the whole interior of the  earth is at the temperature of incandescence, and that the eruptions  of volcanoes and the shocks of earthquakes are merely consequences of  the gradual shrinkage of the external crust, as it continually strives  to accommodate itself to the lessening bulk of the fluid interior.  But whichever view we may adopt, it is at least obvious that the earth  is in part, at all events, a heated body, and that the heat is not in  the nature of a combustion, generated and sustained by the progress of  chemical action. No doubt there may be local phenomena of this  description, but by far the larger proportion of the earth's internal  heat seems merely the fervour of incandescence. It is to be likened to  the heat of the molten iron which has been run into the sand, rather  than to the glowing coals in the furnace in which that iron has been  smelted.    There is one volcanic outbreak of such exceptional interest in these  modern times that I cannot refrain from alluding to it. Doubtless  every one has heard of that marvellous eruption of Krakatoa, which  occurred on August 26th and 27th, 1883, and gives a unique chapter in  the history of volcanic phenomena. Not alone was the eruption of  Krakatoa alarming in its more ordinary manifestations, but it was  unparalleled both in the vehemence of the shock and in the distance to  which the effects of the great eruption were propagated. I speak not  now of the great waves of ocean that inundated the coasts of Sumatra  and Java, and swept away thirty-six thousand people, nor do I allude  to the intense darkness which spread for one hundred and eighty miles  or more all round. I shall just mention the three most important  phenomena, which demonstrate the energy which still resides in the  interior of our earth. Place a terrestrial globe before you, and fix  your attention on the Straits of Sunda; think also of the great  atmospheric ocean some two or three hundred miles deep which envelopes  our earth. When a pebble is tossed into a pond a beautiful series of  concentric ripples diverge from it; so when Krakatoa burst up in that  mighty catastrophe, a series of gigantic waves were propagated through  the air; they embraced the whole globe, converged to the antipodes of  Krakatoa, thence again diverged, and returned to the seat of the  volcano; a second time the mighty series of atmospheric ripples spread  to the antipodes, and a second time returned. Seven times did that  series of waves course over our globe, and leave their traces on every  self-recording barometer that our earth possesses. Thirty-six hours  were occupied in the journey of the great undulation from Krakatoa to  its antipodes. Perhaps even more striking was the extent of our  earth's surface over which the noise of the great explosion spread. At  Batavia, ninety-four miles away, the concussions were simply  deafening; at Macassar, in Celebes, two steamers were sent out to  investigate the explosions which were heard, little thinking that they  came from Krakatoa, nine hundred and sixty-nine miles away. Alarming  sounds were heard over the island of Timor, one thousand three hundred  and fifty-one miles away from Krakatoa. Diego Garcia in the Chogos  islands is two thousand two hundred and sixty-seven miles from  Krakatoa, but the thunders traversed even this distance, and were  attributed to some ship in distress, for which a search was made. Most  astounding of all, there is undoubted evidence that the sound of the  mighty explosion was propagated across nearly the entire Indian ocean,  and was heard in the island of Rodriguez, almost three thousand miles  away. The immense distance over which this sound journeyed will be  appreciated by the fact, that the noise did not reach Rodriguez until  four hours after it had left Krakatoa. In fact, it would seem that if  Vesuvius were to explode with the same vehemence as Krakatoa did, the  thunders of the explosion might penetrate so far as to be heard in  London.    There is another and more beautiful manifestation of the world-wide  significance of the Krakatoa outbreak. The vast column of smoke and  ashes ascended twenty miles high in the air, and commenced a series of  voyages around the equatorial regions of the earth. In three days it  crossed the Indian ocean, and was traversing equatorial Africa; then  came an Atlantic voyage; and then it coursed over central America,  before a Pacific voyage brought it back to its point of departure  after thirteen days; then the dust started again, and was traced  around another similar circuit, while it was even tracked for a  considerable time in placing the third girdle round the earth. Strange  blue suns and green moons and other mysterious phenomena marked the  progress of this vast volcanic cloud. At last the cloud began to lose  its density, the dust spread more widely over the tropics, became  diffused through the temperate regions, and then the whole earth was  able to participate in the glories of Krakatoa. The marvellous sunsets  in the autumn of 1883 are attributable to this cause; and thus once  again was brought before us the fact that the earth still contains  large stores of thermal energy.    Attempts are sometimes made to explain volcanic phenomena on the  supposition that they are entirely of a local character, and that we  are not entitled to infer the incandescent nature of the earth's  interior from the fact that volcanic outbreaks occasionally happen.  For our present purpose this point is immaterial, though I must say it  appears to me unreasonable to deny that the interior of the earth is  in a most highly heated state. Every test we can apply shows us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24263"],[0,"A Hundred Anecdotes of Animals (#9)"],[1,", that one would imagine its fondness for its  master had entirely overcome the natural predilection for its native  element.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXII.    Retribution.      In a park a fawn, drinking, was suddenly pounced upon by one of the swans,  which pulled the animal into the water, and held it under until quite  drowned. The atrocious action was observed by the other deer in the park,  and did not long go unrevenged; for shortly after this very swan, which  had hitherto never been molested by the deer, was singled out when on  land, and furiously attacked by a herd, which surrounded and presently  killed the offender.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXIII.    Strange Rooks.      In a large north of England town a pair of strange rooks, after an  unsuccessful attempt to effect a lodgment in a rookery at a little  distance from the Exchange, were compelled to abandon the attempt, and to  take refuge on the spire of a building; and although constantly molested  by other rooks, they built their nest on the top of the vane, and there  reared a brood of young ones, undisturbed by the noise of the populace  below them. The nest and its inmates were of course turned about by every  change of the wind. For ten years they continued to build their nest in  the same place, soon after which the spire was taken down.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXIV.    A Singular Foster-Mother.      On an estate in Scotland a terrier had a litter of whelps, which were  immediately taken from her and drowned. The unfortunate mother was quite  disconsolate, until, a few weeks after, she perceived a brood of  ducklings, which she immediately seized and carried to her lair, where she  retained them, following them out and in with the greatest care, and  nursing them after her own fashion, with the most affectionate anxiety.  When the ducklings, following their natural instinct, went into the water,  their foster-mother exhibited the utmost alarm; and as soon as they  returned to land, she snatched them up in her mouth, and ran home with  them. What adds to the singularity of this circumstance is, that the same  animal, when deprived of a litter of puppies the year preceding, seized  two cock-chickens, which she reared with the like care she bestows upon  her present family. When the young cocks began to try their voices, their  foster-mother was as much annoyed as she now seems to be by the swimming  of the ducklings--and never failed to repress their attempts at crowing.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXV.    The Shepherd's Dog.      James Hogg, the shepherd poet, had a dog named Sirrah, who was for many  years his sole companion. He was, the shepherd says, the best dog he ever  saw, in spite of his surly manners and unprepossessing appearance. The  first time he saw the dog, a drover was leading him by a rope, and,  although hungry and lean, \"I thought,\" Hogg tells us, \"I discovered a sort  of sullen intelligence in his face, so I gave the drover a guinea for him.  I believe there never was a guinea so well laid out. He was scarcely then  a year old, and knew nothing of herding; but as soon as he discovered that  it was his duty to do so, I can never forget with what eagerness he  learned. He would try every way till he found out what I wanted him to do;  and when once I made him to understand a direction, he never forgot or  mistook it again.\"    About seven hundred lambs, which were at once under Mr. Hogg's care, broke  up at midnight, and scampered off in three divisions across the hills, in  spite of all that the shepherd and an assistant lad could do to keep them  together. \"Sirrah,\" cried the shepherd, in great affliction, \"my man,  they're a' awa.\" The night was so dark that he did not see Sirrah; but the  faithful animal had heard his master's words, and without more ado he set  off in quest of the flock. The shepherd and his companion spent the whole  night in scouring the hills, but of neither the lambs nor Sirrah could  they obtain the slightest trace. \"We had nothing for it,\" says the  shepherd, \"but to return to our master, and inform him that we had lost  his whole flock of lambs. On our way home, however, we discovered a body  of lambs at the bottom of a deep ravine, and Sirrah standing in front of  them, looking all around for some relief. We concluded that it was one of  the divisions of the lambs which Sirrah had been unable to manage until he  came to that commanding situation. But what was our astonishment when we  discovered by degrees that not one was wanting! How he had got all the  divisions collected in the dark is beyond my comprehension. I never felt  so grateful to any creature below the sun as I did to my honest Sirrah  that morning.\"    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXVI.    Foraging.      A constable once made a complaint before a bench of London magistrates  against a horse for stealing hay. The complainant stated that the horse  came regularly every night of its own accord, and without any attendant,  to the coach-stands in St. George's, fully satisfied his appetite, and  then galloped away. He defied the whole of the parish officers to  apprehend him; for if they attempted to go near him while he was eating,  he would throw up his heels and kick at them, or run at them, and if they  did not go out of the way, he would bite them. The constable therefore  thought it best to represent the case to the magistrates.    _One of the Magistrates:_ \"Well, Mr. Constable, if you should be annoyed  again by this animal in the execution of your duty, you may apprehend him  if you can, and bring him before us to answer your complaints.\"    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXVII.    Going to Market.      A butcher and cattle dealer had a dog which he usually took with him when  he drove cattle to the market, at a town some nine miles distant from his  home, to be sold, and who displayed uncommon dexterity in managing them.  At last, so convinced was the master of the sagacity, as well as the  fidelity of his dog, that he made a wager that he would entrust him with a  fixed number of sheep and oxen to drive alone to market. It was stipulated  that no person should be within sight or hearing, who had the least  control over the dog; nor was any spectator to interfere, or be within a  quarter of a mile. On the day of trial, the dog proceeded with his  business in the most dexterous and steady manner; and although he had  frequently to drive his charge through the herds who were grazing, yet he  never lost one, but conducting them into the very yard to which he was  used to drive them when with his master, he significantly delivered them  up to the person appointed to receive them, by barking at the door. What  more particularly marked the dog's sagacity was, that when the path the  herd travelled lay through a spot where others were grazing, he would run  forward, stop his own drove, and then driving the others from each side of  the path, collect his scattered charge and proceed. He was several times  afterwards thus sent alone for the amusement of the curious or the  convenience of his master, and always acquitted himself in the same adroit  and intelligent manner.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXVIII.    The Lion and his Keeper.      In a large continental menagerie there was a lion called Danco, whose cage  was in want of some repairs. His keeper desired a carpenter to set about  it, but when the workman came and saw the lion, he started back with  terror. The keeper entered the animal's cage, and led him to the upper  part of it, while the lower was refitting. He there amused himself for  some time playing with the lion, and being wearied, he soon fell asleep.  The carpenter, fully relying upon the vigilance of the keeper, pursued his  work with rapidity, and when he had finished, he called him to see what  was done. The keeper made no answer. Having repeatedly called in vain, he  began to feel alarmed at his situation, and he determined to go to the  upper part of the cage, where, looking through the railing, he saw the  lion and the keeper sleeping side by side. He immediately uttered a loud  cry; the lion, awakened by the noise, started up and stared at the  carpenter with an eye of fury, and then, placing his paw on the breast of  his keeper, lay down to sleep again. At length the keeper was awakened by  some of the attendants, and he did not appear in the least apprehensive on  account of the situation in which he found himself, but shook the lion by  the paw, and then gently conducted him to his former residence.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXIX.    Immovable Fidelity.      A dog, between the breed of a mastiff and a bull-dog, belonging to a  chimney-sweeper, laid, according to his master's orders, on a soot-bag,  which he had placed inadvertently almost in the middle of a narrow back  street, in a town in the south of England. A loaded cart passing by, the  driver desired the dog to move out of the way. On refusing he was scolded,  then beaten, first gently, and afterwards with the smart application of  the cart-whip; all to no purpose. The fellow, with an oath, threatened to  drive over the dog--he did so, and the faithful animal, in endeavouring to  arrest the progress of the wheel by biting it, was crushed to pieces.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXX.    Tame Hares.      The hare is scarcely a domestic animal; yet we have an account of one who  was so domesticated as to feed from the hand, lay under a chair in a  common sitting-room, and appear in every other respect as easy and  comfortable in its situation as a lapdog. It now and then went out into  the garden, but after regaling itself with the fresh air, always returned  to the house as its proper habitation. Its usual companions were a  greyhound and spaniel, with whom it spent its evenings, the whole three  sporting and sleeping together on the same hearth. What makes the  circumstance more"]]]
