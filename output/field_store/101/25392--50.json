[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24598"],[0,"A Modern History, From the Time of Luther to the Fall of Napoleon (#9)"],[1,"and Zwingle.]    On one point, however, they differed; and this difference led to an  acrimonious contest, quite disgraceful to Luther, and the greatest  blot on his character, inasmuch as it developed, to an extraordinary  degree, both obstinacy and dogmatism, and showed that he could not  bear contradiction or opposition. The quarrel arose from a difference  of views respecting the Lord's supper, Luther maintaining not exactly  the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, but something  approximating to it--even the omnipresence of Christ's body in the  sacred elements. He relinquished the doctrine of the continually  repeated miracle, but substituted a universal miracle, wrought once  for all. In his tenacity to the opinions of the schoolmen on this  point, we see his conservative spirit; for he did not deny tradition,  unless it was expressly contradicted by Scripture. He would have  maintained the whole structure of the Latin church, had it not been  disfigured by modern additions, plainly at variance with the  Scriptures; and so profoundly was he attached to the traditions of the  church, and to the whole church establishment, that he only  emancipated himself by violent inward storms. But Zwingle had not this  lively conception of the universal church, and was more radical in his  sympathies. He took Carlstadt's view of the supper, that it was merely  symbolic. Still he shrunk from a rupture with Luther, which, however,  was unavoidable, considering Luther's views of the subject and his  cast of mind. Luther rejected all offers of conciliation, and, as he  considered it essential to salvation to believe in the real presence  of Christ in the sacrament, he refused to acknowledge Zwingle as a  brother.    Zwingle, nevertheless, continued his reforms, and sought to restore,  what he conceived to be, the earliest forms in which Christianity had  manifested itself. He designed to restore a worship purely spiritual.  He rejected all rites and ceremonies, not expressly enjoined in the  Bible. Luther insisted in retaining all that was not expressly  forbidden. And this was the main point of distinction between them and  their adherents.    But Zwingle contemplated political, as well as religious, changes,  and, as early as 1527, two years before his conference with Luther at  Marburg, had projected a league of all the reformers against the  political authorities which opposed their progress. He combated the  abuses of the state, as well as of the church. This opposition created  great enemies against him among the cantons, with their different  governments and alliances. He also secured enthusiastic friends, and,  in all the cantons, there was a strong democratic party opposed to the  existing oligarchies, which party, in Berne and Basle, St. Gall,  Zurich, Appenzell, Schaffhausen, and Glarus, obtained the ascendency.  This led to tumults and violence, and finally to civil war between the  different cantons, those which adhered to the old faith being assisted  by Austria. Lucerne, Uri Schwytz, Zug, Unterwalden took the lead  against the reformed cantons, the foremost of which was Zurich, where  Zwingle lived. Zurich was attacked. Zwingle, from impulses of  patriotism and courage, issued forth from his house, and joined the  standard of his countrymen, not as a chaplain, but as an armed  warrior. This was his mistake. \"They who take the sword shall perish  with the sword.\" The intrepid and enlightened reformer was slain in  1531, and, with his death, expired the hopes of his party. The  restoration of the Roman Catholic religion immediately commenced in  Switzerland.    Luther, more wise than Zwingle, inasmuch as he abstained from  politics, continued his labors in Germany. And they were immense. The  burdens of his country rested on his shoulders. He was the dictator of  the reformed party, and his word was received as law. Moreover, the  party continually increased, and, from the support it received from  some of the most powerful of the German princes, it became formidable,  even in a political point of view. Nearly one half of Germany embraced  the reformed faith.    [Sidenote: Diet of Augsburg.]    The illustrious Charles V. had now, for some time, been emperor, and,  in the prosecution of his conquests, found it necessary to secure the  support of united Germany, especially since Germany was now invaded by  the Turks. In order to secure this support, he found it necessary to  make concessions in religion to his Protestant subjects. At the diet  of Augsburg, (1530,) where there was the most brilliant assemblage of  princes which had been for a long time seen in Germany, the celebrated  confession of the faith of the Protestants was read. It was written by  Melancthon, in both Latin and German, on the basis of the articles of  Torgau, which Luther had prepared. The style was Melancthon's; the  matter was Luther's. It was comprised in twenty-eight articles, of  which twenty-one pertained to the faith of the Protestants--the name  they assumed at the second diet of Spires, in 1529--and the remaining  seven recounted the errors and abuses of Rome. It was subscribed by  the Elector of Saxony, the Marquis of Brandenburg, the Duke of  Lunenburg, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Prince of Anhalt, and the  deputies of the imperial cities Nuremberg and Reutlingen. But the  Catholics had the ascendency in the diet, and the \"Confession of  Augsburg\" was condemned. But the emperor did not venture on any  decisive measures for the extirpation of the \"heresy.\" He threatened  and published edicts, but his menaces had but little force.  Nevertheless, the Protestant princes assembled, first at Smalcalde,  and afterwards at Frankfort, for an alliance of mutual defence,--the  first effective union of free princes and states against their  oppressors in modern Europe,--and laid the foundation of liberty of  conscience. Hostilities, however, did not commence, since the emperor  was desirous of uniting Germany against the Turks; and he therefore  recalled his edicts of Worms and Augsburg against the Protestants, and  made important concessions, and promised them undisturbed enjoyment of  their religion. This was a great triumph to the Protestants, and as  great a shock to the Papal power.    [Sidenote: League of Smalcalde.]    The Confession of Augsburg and the League of Smalcalde form an  important era of Protestantism, since, by these, the reformed faith  received its definite form, and was moreover guaranteed. The work for  which Luther had been raised up was now, in the main, accomplished.  His great message had been delivered and heard.    [Sidenote: Death and Character of Luther.]    After the confirmation of his cause, his life was perplexed and  anxious. He had not anticipated those civil commotions which he now  saw, sooner or later, were inevitable. With the increase of his party  was the decline of spirituality. Political considerations, also, with  many, were more prominent than moral. Religion and politics were  mingled together, not soon to be separated in the progress of reform.  Moreover, the reformers differed upon many points among themselves.  There was a lamentable want of harmony between the Germans and the  Swiss. Luther had quarrelled with nearly every prominent person with  whom he had been associated, except Melancthon, who yielded to him  implicit obedience. But, above all, the Anabaptist disorders, which he  detested, and which distracted the whole bishopric of Muenster,  oppressed and mortified him. Worn out with cares, labors, and  vexations, which ever have disturbed the peace and alloyed the  happiness of great heroes, and from which no greatness is exempt, he  died at Eisleben, in 1545, while on a visit to his native place in  older to reconcile dissensions between the counts of Mansfeldt.    Luther's name is still reverenced in Germany, and, throughout all  Protestant countries, he is regarded as the greatest man connected  with the history of the church since the apostolic age. Others have  been greater geniuses, others more learned, others more devout, and  others more amiable and interesting; but none ever evinced greater  intrepidity, or combined greater qualities of mind and heart. He had  his faults: he was irritable, dogmatic, and abusive in his  controversial writings. He had no toleration for those who differed  from him--the fault of the age. But he was genial, joyous, friendly,  and disinterested. His labors were gigantic; his sincerity  unimpeached; his piety enlightened; his zeal unquenchable.  Circumstances and the new ideas of his age, favored him, but he made  himself master of those circumstances and ideas, and, what is more,  worked out ideas of his own, which were in harmony with Christianity.  The Reformation would have happened had there been no Luther, though  at a less favorable time; but, of all the men of his age that the  Reformation could least spare, Martin Luther stands preeminent. As the  greatest of reformers, his name will be ever honored.           *       *       *       *       *         REFERENCES.--The attention of the student is directed only       to the most prominent and valuable works which treat of       Luther and the Protestant reformation.

THE EMPEROR CHARLES V.      [Sidenote: Charles V."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#9)"],[1,"next day she found on a shelf in the  sitting-room a heap of old silver pieces and clippings, which it is to  be supposed the Troll had brought her.[16]    Apart from the need of human aid, common to all the legends with which  we are dealing, the two points emphasized by these Swedish tales are the  midwife's refusal of food and the gratitude of the Troll. In a Swabian  story the Earthman, as he is called, apologizes for omitting to offer  food. In this case the midwife was afraid to go alone with her summoner,  and begged that her husband might accompany her. This was permitted; and  the Earthman showed them the way through the forest with his lantern,  for it was of course night. They came first to a moss door, then to a  wooden door, and lastly to a door of shining metal, whence a staircase  went down into the earth, and led them into a large and splendid chamber  where the Earthwife lay. When the object of their visit was accomplished  the Earthman thanked the woman much, and said: \"You do not relish our  meat and drink, wherefore I will bestow something else upon thee.\" With  these words he gave her a whole apronful of black coals, and taking his  lantern again he lighted the midwife and her husband home. On the way  home she slily threw away one coal after another. The Earthman said  nothing until he was about to take his leave, when he observed merely:  \"The less you scattered the more you might have.\" After he had gone the  woman's husband remonstrated with her, bidding her keep the coals, for  the Earthman appeared in earnest with his gift. When they reached home,  however, she shook out her apron on the hearth, and behold! instead of  coals, glittering true gold pieces. The woman now sought eagerly enough  after the coals she had thrown away, but she found them not.[17]    Confining our attention for the moment to the refusal of food, it would  seem that the Earthman's apology in the foregoing narrative is, as too  many human apologies are, a mere excuse. The real reason for the  midwife's abstention was not that fairy food was distasteful, but that  she durst not touch it, under penalty of never again returning to the  light of day. A Danish tradition tells of a woman who was taken by an  elf on Christmas Eve down into the earth to attend his wife. As soon as  the elfwife was delivered her husband took the child away; for if he  could find two newly married persons in the bridal bed, before they had  repeated their Paternoster, he could, by laying the child between them,  procure for it all the good fortune intended for the newly wedded pair.  During his absence the elfwife took the opportunity of instructing her  helper as to her conduct when he returned; and the first and chief point  of her advice was to eat nothing that was offered her. The elfwife was  herself a Christian woman who had been inveigled down into the dwellings  of the elves; she had eaten, and therefore had never escaped again. On  the elf's return, accordingly, the midwife refused food, and he said:  \"They did not strike thee on the mouth who taught thee that.\" Late  rabbinical writings contain a similar legend of a Mohel, a man whose  office it was to circumcise, who was summoned one winter's night by a  stranger to perform the ceremony upon a child who would be eight days  old the following day. The stranger led him to a lofty mountain, into  the bowels of which they passed, and after descending many flights of  steps found themselves in a great city. Here the Mohel was taken to a  palace, in one of whose apartments was the child's mother lying. When  she saw the Mohel she began to weep, and told him that he was in the  land of the Mazikin, but that she was a human being, a Jewess, who had  been carried away when little from home and brought thither. And she  counselled him to take good heed to refuse everything whether of meat or  drink that might be offered him: \"For if thou taste anything of theirs  thou wilt become like one of them, and wilt remain here for ever.\"[18]    We touch here upon a very ancient and widespread superstition, which we  may pause to illustrate from different parts of the world. A Manx tale,  which can be traced back to Waldron, narrates the night adventure of a  farmer who lost his way in returning home from Peel, and was led by the  sound of music into a large hall where were a great number of little  people feasting. Among them were some faces he seemed to know; but he  took no notice of them until the little folk offered him drink, when one  of them, whose features seemed not unknown to him, plucked him by the  coat and forbade him, whatever he did, to taste anything he saw before  him; \"for if you do\", he added, \"you will be as I am, and return no more  to your family.\"[19]    It is necessary for the hero of a Picard story to go and seek the devil  in his own abode. The devil of popular imagination, though a terrific  ogre, is not the entirely Evil One of theologians; and one of his good  points in the story referred to is that he has three fair daughters, the  fairest of whom is compelled by the hero to help him in overcoming her  father. She accordingly instructs him to eat no meat and to drink no  wine at the devil's house, otherwise he will be poisoned. This may  remind us of Kan Puedaei, who in the Altaic ballad descends with his steed  to the middle of the earth and encounters various monsters. There the  grass and the water of the mountain forest through which he rode were  poison. In both cases, what is probably meant is, that to eat or drink  is to return no more from these mysterious abodes; and it may be to the  intent to obviate any such consequence that Saint Peter, in sending a  certain king's son down through a black and stinking hole a hundred  toises deep underground, in a Gascon tale, to fetch Saint Peter's own  sword, provides him with just enough bread in his wallet every morning  to prevent his bursting with hunger. An extension of this thought  sometimes even prohibits the hero from accepting a seat or a bed offered  by way of hospitality on the part of the devil, or the sorceress, to  whose dwelling his business may take him, or even to look at the fair  temptress who may seek to entice him to eat.[20]    The meaning of the superstition is not easy to trace, but it should be  remembered that in the lower stages of human civilization no distinction  is drawn between supernatural or spiritual beings who have never been  enclosed in human bodies, and the spirits of the dead. Savage philosophy  mingles them together in one phantasmagoria of grotesquery and horror.  The line which separates fairies and ogres from the souls of men has  gradually grown up through ages of Christian teaching; and, broad as it  may seem to us, it is occasionally hardly visible in these stories.  Every now and then it is ignored, as in the case of the old friends  found among the \"little people\" by the Manx farmer. Less startling than  these, but quite as much in point, are the women, like some already  mentioned, who are carried off into Fairyland, where they become wives  and mothers. They can never come back to their old life, though they  retain enough of the \"mortal mixture\" to require the adventurous human  midwife to relieve their pains. Accordingly, we need not be surprised if  the same incidents of story or fibres of superstition attach at one time  to ghosts and at another to the non-human creatures of imagination, or  if Hades and Fairyland are often confounded. Both are equally the realm  of the supernatural. We may therefore inquire whether eating is  forbidden to the chance sojourner in the place of the dead equally as to  the sojourner in Fairyland, if he wish to return to the upper air. And  we shall find that it is.    Proserpine ate seven grains of a pomegranate which grew in the Elysian  Fields, and so was compelled to remain in the Shades, the wife of \"the  grisly king.\" Thus, too, when Morgan the Fay takes measures to get Ogier  the Dane into her power she causes him to be shipwrecked on a loadstone  rock near to Avalon. Escaping from the sea, he comes to an orchard, and  there eats an apple which, it is not too much to say, seals his fate.  Again, when Thomas of Erceldoune is being led down by the Fairy Queen  into her realm, he desires to eat of the fruit of certain trees.        \"He presed to pul the frute with his honde,      As man for fode was nyhonde feynte;      She seid, Thomas, lat them stande,      Or ellis the fiend will the ateynte.      If thou pulle the sothe to sey,      Thi soule goeth to the fyre of hell      Hit cummes never out til doomsday,      But ther ever in payne to dwelle.\"    An old story preserved for us by Saxo Grammaticus describes the visit of  some Danish heroes to Guthmund, a giant who rules a delightful land  beyond a certain river crossed by a golden bridge. Thorkill, their  conductor, a Scandinavian Ulysses for cunning, warns his companions of  the various temptations that will be set before them. They must forbear  the food of the country, and be satisfied with that which they had  brought with them; moreover, they must keep apart from the natives,  taking care not so much as to touch them. In spite, however, of  Thorkill's warnings to them, and his excuses in their behalf to the  king, some of the heroes fell and were left behind when their friends  were at last allowed to depart.[21] So far we see that the prohibition  and the danger we found extant in the Fairyland of modern folk-tales  apply also to the classic Hades; and we have traced them back a long way  into the Middle Ages in French, British, and Danish traditions relating  to fairies and other supernatural existences, with a special threat of  Hell in the case of Thomas of Erceldoune.    On the other side of the globe the Banks' islanders believe, like the  Greeks, in an underground kingdom of the dead, which they call Panoi.  Only a few years ago a woman was living who"]]]
