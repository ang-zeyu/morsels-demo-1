She stamped her foot in childish rage, saying vehemently: \"She is a  nobody, that Stevens person, and her family are vagabonds. You will make  a great mistake if you choose her for your friend.\" Then, her rage  receding as suddenly as it had come, she shrugged her shoulders  deprecatingly. \"Pardonnez moi.\" She bowed to Marjorie. \"I spoke too  strongly. It is not for me to choose Miss Dean's friends.\" Slipping her  arm through Muriel's, she drew her ahead of the others. Susan Atwell  took a hurried step forward and caught her other arm, leaving Marjorie  to walk between Irma and Geraldine.    \"Don't mind her,\" said Jerry, in a low voice. \"She has it in for that  Miss Stevens. She, the Stevens girl, did something, no one knows what,  to make Mignon angry with her. Mignon says Miss Stevens talked about her  and Muriel and Susan believed it, but Irma and I are not so silly.\"    Two blocks further on Marjorie bade good-bye to the five girls. She said  it without enthusiasm. Their carping, quarrelsome attitude had taken all  the pleasure from knowing them. She made mental exception in favor of  Irma and Jerry. The gentleness of the one and the sturdy, outspoken  manner of the other had impressed her favorably. But she was sorely  disappointed in Muriel.    Should she tell her mother of the disagreeable ending of her first day?  She decided not to do so. She would carry nothing save pleasant tales to  her captain to-day. And so that night, when she entered the living-room  and found her mother, in a becoming negligee, occupying the wide leather  couch by the window, she saluted, like a dutiful soldier, and included  in her report only the pleasant happenings of her first,  never-to-be-forgotten day in Sanford High School.          CHAPTER VIII    STANDING BY HER COLORS      When Marjorie took her seat in the study hall the next morning, Muriel's  greeting was as affable as it had been before the disagreement of the  previous afternoon. She even went so far as to whisper, \"Don't take  Mignon too seriously. She is really dreadfully hurt over the unkind  things Miss Stevens has said of her.\"    Marjorie listened in polite silence to the Picture Girl's rather lame  apology in behalf of her friend. She could think of nothing to say.  Muriel had turned about in her seat, her eyes fixed expectantly upon the  other girl. But just then came an unexpected interruption.    \"Miss Dean,\" shrilled Miss Merton's high, querulous voice, \"who gave you  permission to leave school before the regular hour of dismissal  yesterday afternoon?\"    \"I did not----\" began the astonished girl.    \"Young woman, do you mean to contradict me?\" thundered Miss Merton.    Marjorie had now risen to her feet. Her pretty face had turned very  white, her brown eyes gleamed like two angry flames. \"I had no intention  of contradicting you, Miss Merton.\" Her low, steady tones were full of  repressed indignation. \"What I had begun to say was that I did not know  I was expected to return to the study hall after my last class. In the  high school which I attended in B---- we went from our last class to our  locker rooms. It is, of course, my fault. I should have inquired about  it beforehand.\" The freshman quietly resumed her seat.    Every pair of eyes in the room was turned upon Marjorie.    Miss Merton, however, had no intention of letting her off so easily.  \"The rules and regulations of another high school do not, in the least,  interest me, Miss Dean,\" she said, with biting sarcasm. \"It is my  business to see that the rules of _Sanford_ High School are enforced,  and I propose to do it. You have been a pupil in this school for only  one day, yet I have been obliged to reprimand you on two different  occasions. If you annoy me further I shall consider myself fully  justified in sending you to Miss Archer.\"    The ringing of the first recitation bell put an end to the little scene.  Marjorie rose from her seat and marched from the study hall, her head  held high. If Miss Merton expected her to break down and cry she would  find herself sadly mistaken. Muriel overtook her in the corridor. \"My,  but Miss Merton hates you!\" she commented cheerfully, as though enjoying  her classmate's discomfiture.    Marjorie made no reply. Her proud spirit was too deeply crushed for  words. She went through her recitation in English that morning like one  in a dream. Several times during her French hour she gazed appealingly  at Constance, but the Mary girl kept her fair head turned resolutely  away. She did not appear at her locker either at noon or after school  was over, although Marjorie lingered, in the hope that she would come.    So successfully did she manage to steer clear of Marjorie, who was too  proud to make advances in the face of Constance's marked avoidance,  that, when Friday came and the afternoon session was over, Marjorie was  escorted to the gymnasium by the Picture Girl and her friends, who, even  to Mignon, believed that the newcomer had been wise and taken their  brusque advice.    At least half of the freshman class had elected to try for a place on  the team. Miss Randall, the instructor in gymnastics, and several  seniors had been chosen to pick the team, and when the six girls arrived  on the scene the testing had begun. Mignon La Salle was the first of  their group to play. Her almost marvelous agility, her quick, catlike  springs and her fleetness of foot called forth unstinted praise from  Marjorie. Muriel, too, played a skilful game; so did Susan Atwell. When  Marjorie was called upon to play left guard on a team composed of the  last lot of aspirants for basketball honors, she advanced to her  position rather nervously. Muriel, Mignon, Susan Atwell and two  freshmen, whom she did not know, were to oppose her. She wondered if she  could play fast enough to keep up with her clever opponents. Then, as  she caught the French girl's elfish eyes fixed upon her, mocking  incredulity in their depths, she rallied her doubting spirit and  resolved to outplay even Mignon.    Fifteen minutes later Marjorie Dean had been chosen to play left guard  on a team of which Mignon was center, Muriel, right guard, Susan Atwell,  right forward, and a freshman named Harriet Delaney, left forward.  Muriel had also been made captain, and several girls were chosen as  substitutes.    \"Hurrah for the new team!\" cried Muriel Harding. \"Let's call ourselves  the Invincibles. You certainly can play basketball, Miss Dean. How lucky  in you to come to Sanford just when we need you. By the way, 'Miss Dean'  is too formal. Please let us call you Marjorie. You can call us by our  first names. What's the use of so much formality among team-mates?\"    Being merely a very human young girl, Marjorie could not help feeling a  little bit pleased with herself. She was glad she had played so well.  She felt that she had really begun to like her new associates very much.  Even Mignon must have her good points; and how wonderfully well she  played basketball! Perhaps Constance Stevens had been just a little bit  at fault. Certainly she had acted very queerly after that first day when  they had pledged their friendship. Had she, Marjorie, been wise to avow  unswerving loyalty to a stranger, and all because she looked like Mary  Raymond? Marjorie's disquieting reflections were interrupted by  something the French girl was saying.    \"It was too funny for anything, wasn't it, Muriel?\" Mignon laughed with  gleeful malice.    \"Yes,\" nodded Muriel. \"We gave the sophomores a bad scare.\"    \"What did you do?\" asked Irma Linton, curiously.    Seeing that she had the attention of her audience, the French girl  began.    \"You remember the practice game we played against the sophomores last  week? According to my way of thinking, the sophomores played a very  rough game. I complained to Miss Seymour, their captain. She laughed at  me,\" Mignon scowled at the remembrance, \"so I decided to teach her a  lesson.\"    \"I told Muriel about it, and between us we made up a dialogue. It was  all about the sophomores' unfair playing, and how surprised they would  be when they found themselves forbidden to play basketball. Then we  managed to walk out of school behind two girls that always tell  everything they know, and recited our dialogue. The next morning Muriel  saw one of the girls talking to Miss Seymour for all she was worth, so  we know that she faithfully repeated everything she heard. Miss Seymour  wouldn't dare go to Miss Archer with it for fear Miss Archer would ask  too many questions. You know Miss Archer said last year when Inez  Chester made such a fuss about her sprained wrist that if ever again one  team reported another for rough playing she would disband the accused  team and have Miss Randall select a new one. So I imagine we gave our  friends the sophs something to think about.\"    \"But who told you the sophomores would be forbidden to play?\" demanded  candid Jerry.    \"No one told us, silly,\" retorted Muriel, her color rising. \"We simply  said they would be surprised when they found themselves forbidden to  play. 'When' may mean next week or next month, or next year or century,  or any other time. We were only talking for their general edification.\"    \"Then nobody actually said a word about it?\" persisted Jerry. \"You just  made up all that stuff?\"    \"It didn't do any hurt,\" began Muriel. \"We thought----\"    \"Don't be such a prig, Jerry,\" put in Mignon, impatiently. \"It isn't  half so wicked to play a joke on those stupid sophomores as it is to ask  one's mother for money for a fountain pen, and then use the money for  candy and ice cream.\"    There was a chorus of giggles from the girls, in which Jerry did not  join. She was eyeing Mignon steadily. \"See here, Mignon,\" she said with  offended dignity. \"I just want you to know that I told my mother about  that money that very same night. I may have my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#9)"],[1,"  And from that moment David had unconsciously taken the motto which was  his through all his adventurous life:    \"I shall not raise my hand against the Lord's anointed.\"    From that hour when he went back to tend his sheep, after Samuel's  visit, to the time when his destiny was fulfilled, David, even under  the stress of fierce temptation, never moved a finger to hasten events;  never tried to force his way to the throne of Israel, but with buoyant  courage, did his duty day by day, and the monotony of his early  shepherd's life was varied only by an occasional unexpected adventure.    Look--listen--as he wanders over the hillside at dusk, he shows  alarm--he hears a dreaded sound! Ah, yes, one he knew too well--the  stealthy glide of a creeping foe coming to attack his flock.    Alone, with only his sling for weapon, in that wild unpeopled country,  the shepherd boy stands, brave and alert, ready to protect his sheep.  Ah, a lion! the stealthy beast creeps nearer, nearer.    Suddenly David draws his sling, the stone strikes the lion between the  eyes, he falls by a single shot. But look--this is not the end of the  battle. Even while David is encountering the lion, that most dreaded of  all foes of the flock, a huge bear glides with stealthy steps, and  seizes a lamb. Quick as an arrow David hurls himself upon the monstrous  beast, who drops his prey and rises in angry power on his hind legs to  hug and crush his enemy. But David is too quick for him, he grasps the  bear by the jaw with iron force, grapples with him, the great creature  snarls, moans, writhes and is no more, while David, hot with the joy of  victory, turns back to quiet his frightened flock.    Does not this encounter give a hint of the fearless courage that made  David such a famous warrior in later life?    Now let us note another side of his many-sided character while we  listen to the melodies he so dearly loved to play on his harp as he  wandered over the hills and plains with his flock. David had in him the  making of a mighty warrior, a great king, but he had too, a dreamy,  sensitive, poetic side to his nature, which made him deeply appreciate  and enjoy all the beauty of nature which he tried to express in his  music, and which long years later, came out more clearly in those  wonderful psalms which he wrote, and which have comforted and helped so  many generations of Christian people.    In those days Saul was becoming less and less of a dignified,  self-controlled leader, as he began to realise that he was not powerful  enough to hold his people, and he frequently gave way to fits of  terrible anger or prolonged melancholy, from which no one could rouse  him. At that time when the Philistines were gaining so many victories  over the Israelites, it was most important that Saul should not give  way to such attacks, as they unfitted him to perform his public or  private duties, and every means of quieting him was tried, but in vain.  Finally, it was suggested that music has a soothing effect on troubled  spirits, and when the idea was mentioned to Saul it pleased him, and he  at once commanded that a musician be found and brought to him. Then  came the question of who that musician should be, and one of Saul's  counsellors said:    \"Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite, that is cunning  in playing and a comely person, and the Lord is with him.\"    The description pleased Saul and he at once sent a messenger to Jesse,  saying:    \"Send me David, thy son, which is with the sheep.\"    And so once again, there came to David a new experience for which he  had had no preparation, and again, as before, he neither refused nor  questioned the call to a different life, but while Jesse, his father,  was preparing a present to send to Saul by David, according to the  custom of the times, David was making hasty preparations to leave home.  Soon he was ready to set off, and taking with him an ass laden with  bread, a bottle of wine and a young kid, which were Jesse's present to  Saul, on he journeyed over the hills and through the valleys until he  reached the court of the King, and presently stood in the presence of  Saul, who almost as soon as he had looked at the lad with his fair,  bright face and sturdy figure, took a great fancy to him, and commanded  him to become one of his household and to come and play to him whenever  he should be summoned, and also sent this message back to Jesse:    \"Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he hath found favour in  my sight.\"    So David stayed at the King's court, and whenever Saul gave way to an  attack of anger or depression, the young minstrel would hasten to him,  and play melodies grave and gay, sweet and brilliant, playing with such  skill that before he knew it, Saul would be in good humour again, or  drop into a deep, refreshing sleep, and little did he dream that the  lad who had such power to soothe and amuse him had been anointed by  Samuel to rule over Israel in his place. That David thought often and  earnestly about this, would be only natural to suppose, and we can but  fancy that in those days amid surroundings such as he had never had  before, the young lad learned much of the manners and customs of a  king's life, and learned too, from the weakness that he saw in Saul's  nature what a king ought to be and do. Probably much of David's tact in  dealing with men and circumstances at a later day came from his  observations in those early days when he was but a minstrel at the  court of Saul.    How long he remained there, we do not know, but until Saul's attacks of  passion and melancholy had been entirely overcome. Then, in the same  spirit of unquestioning obedience as he showed before to the call of  circumstances, as soon as he was no longer needed by Saul, David went  back again to his home in Bethlehem and again tended his father's  flocks in the Judean pasture-lands.    The Israelites and the Philistines were still at war, and the two  armies were now encamped against each other on opposite ridges that  overhung a valley, called the valley of the Terebinth, about sixteen  miles from Bethlehem.    Battles in those days were sometimes merely encounters between two  champions chosen by the opposing armies to fight for them; but the  Philistines had given no hint to the Israelites that this was to be  their plan of action, when suddenly, out from their camp there burst  forth Goliath, the last and mightiest of the giants of Gath, and  shouted out a challenge to the Israelites, saying:    \"Why are ye come out to set your battles in array? Am not I a  Philistine and ye servants to Saul? Choose you a man for you and let  him come down to me. If he be able to fight with me and kill me, then  will we be your servants, but if I prevail against him, then shall ye  be our servants and serve us!\" And he added in a mighty voice that rang  through the valley:    \"I defy the armies of Israel this day! Give me a man that we may fight  together!\"    Colossal and terrifying, the great monster stood, like a glittering  mountain of power as the rays of the sun fell upon him, for he was over  ten feet tall, and his coat of mail was as heavy as bags of gold would  be, and shone like a mirror, and on his head was a huge helmet of  brass, and even his mighty limbs were covered with shining metal. He  carried a brass spear with a head heavier than that of ten ordinary  spears, and the staff of it was as huge as a young birch tree, while  before him walked the bearer of his shield, glittering too in the rays  of the sun. A mighty monster, he, Goliath, the giant of Gath, as he  faced the army of the Israelites and thundered forth his challenge to  them to find a warrior bold enough to fight with him, and the  Israelites were filled with fear as they saw him, and Saul's heart was  heavy with terror, and he at once offered great riches and the hand of  his daughter to any warrior who would accept Goliath's challenge. But  for forty days not a man answered the challenge or attempted to win the  reward offered by Saul.    Then David, who was still tending his father's flocks, but whose three  elder brothers were with the army of the Israelites, was sent by his  father to carry supplies of food to them. Of course, David had heard  much at home that interested him deeply in the armies and their  manoeuvres, and now he could scarcely restrain his joy at the thought  of seeing the encampments for himself, and he got up early the next  morning and leaving his sheep with a keeper, set out gleefully, even  though what he had to carry was a heavy burden, for he was taking a  large quantity of parched corn and ten loaves of bread to his brothers,  as well as ten cheeses to the captain of their division of the army.  But he was so happy at the change in his monotonous life that he did  not mind the length of the journey nor the weight of his burden.    And when he saw the tents of the encampments lying before him, he  thrilled with the courage and the desire of a born warrior, and quickly  leaving his provisions with the keeper of supplies, he ran forward to  the division of the camp where his brothers were, and eagerly greeted  them, but they seemed not at all glad to see him, even though he had  come to bring them sorely needed food.    Jealousy is one of the worst faults a person can have, and it is to be  feared that David's family all felt it and showed it for this youngest  brother, who though a mere boy of seventeen, had received honours, and  shown ability far beyond their own, instead of rejoicing in his good  fortune, as they should have done.    But David was evidently accustomed to their manner, and was unconscious  then of everything but his keen desire to know what the plans of the  two armies were, and poured out question after question, without  heeding the impatience of his brothers' answers.    And as he stood talking, there suddenly stood before him the glittering  monster"]]]
