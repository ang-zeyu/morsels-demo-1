There is in the Custody of the present Earl of _Stafford_,    a Nobleman of the greatest Humanity and Goodness, an Original of    Instructions, by the Earl of _Arundell_, written in the Year 1620,    for the Benefit of his younger Son, the Earl of _Stafford's_    Grandfather, under this Title;        _Instructions for you my Son _William_, how to behave          your self at _Norwich_._      In these Instructions is the following paragraph, \"You shall in    all Things reverence honour and obey my Lord Bishop of _Norwich_,    as you would do any of your Parents, esteeminge whatsoever He    shall tell or Command you, as if your Grandmother of _Arundell_,    your Mother, or my self, should say it; and in all things esteem    your self as my Lord's Page; a breeding which youths of my house    far superior to you were accustomed unto, as my Grandfather of    _Norfolk_, and his Brother my good Uncle of _Northampton_ were    both bred as Pages with Bishopps, _&c_.\"    Sir Thomas More, who was born in 1480, was brought up in the house of  Cardinal Morton. Roper says that he was      \"received into the house of the right reverend, wise, and learned    prelate Cardinal Morton, where, though he was young of years, yet    would he at Christmas-tide suddenly sometimes step in among the    players, and never studying for the matter make a part of his own    there presently among them, which made the lookers on more sport    than all the players beside. In whose wit and towardness the    Cardinal much delighting would say of him unto the nobles that    divers times dined with him, _This child here waiting at the    table, Whosoever shall live to see it, will prove a marvellous    man._ Whereupon for his better furtherance in learning he placed    him at Oxford, &c.\" (Roper's _Life of More_, ed. Singer, 1822,    p. 3.)    Cresacre More in his _Life of More_ (ed. 1828, p. 17) states the same  thing more fully, and gives the remark of the Cardinal more accurately,  thus:-- \"that that boy there waiting _on him_, whoever should live to  see it, would prove a marvellous rare man.\"[17]        [Headnote: YOUNG NOBLES IN WOLSEY'S HOUSEHOLD.]    Through Wolsey's household, says Professor Brewer, almost all the  Officials of Henry the Eighth's time passed. Cavendish, in his Life of  Wolsey (vol. i. p. 38, ed. Singer, 1825) says of the Cardinal, \"And at  meals, there was continually in his chamber a board kept for his  Chamberlains, and Gentlemen Ushers, having with them _a mess of the  young Lords_, and another for gentlemen.\" Among these young Lords, we  learn at p. 57, was      \"my Lord Percy, the son and heir of the Earl of Northumberland,    [who] then attended upon the Lord Cardinal, and was also his    servitor; and when it chanced the Lord Cardinal at any time to    repair to the court, the Lord Percy would then resort for his    pastime unto the queen's chamber, and there would fall in    dalliance among the queen's maidens, being at the last more    conversant with Mistress Anne Boleyn than with any other; so that    there grew such a secret love between them that, at length they    were insured together, intending to marry[18].\"    Among the persons daily attendant upon Wolsey in his house, down-lying  and up-rising, Cavendish enumerates \"of Lords nine or ten, who had each  of them allowed two servants; and the Earl of Derby had allowed five  men\" (p. 36-7). On this Singer prints a note, which looks like a guess,  signed _Growe_, \"Those Lords that were placed in the great and privy  chambers were _Wards_, and as such paid for their board and education.\"  It will be seen below that he had a particular officer called  \"Instructor of his Wards\" (_Cavendish_, p. 38, l. 2). Why I suppose the  note to be a guess is, because at p. 33 Cavendish has stated that Wolsey  \"had also a great number daily attending upon him, both of noblemen and  worthy gentlemen, of great estimation and possessions,--with no small  number of the tallest yeomen that he could get in all his realm; in so  much that well was that nobleman and gentleman that might prefer any  tall and comely yeoman unto his service.\"    In the household of the Earl of Northumberland in 1511 were \"..yong  gentlemen at their fryndes fynding,[19] in my lords house for the hoole  yere\" and \"Haunsmen ande Yong Gentlemen at thir Fryndes fynding v[j] (As  to say, Hanshmen iij. And Yong Gentlemen iij\" p. 254,) no doubt for the  purpose of learning manners, &c. And that such youths would be found in  the house of every noble of importance I believe, for as Walter Mapes  (? ab. 1160-90 A.D.) says of the great nobles, in his poem _De diversis  ordinibus hominum_, the example of manners goes out from their houses,  _Exemplar morum domibus procedit eorum_. That these houses were in some  instances only the finishing schools for our well-born young men after  previous teaching at home and at College is possible (though the cases  of Sir Thomas More and Ascham are exactly the other way), but the Lord  Percy last named had a schoolmaster in his house, \"The Maister of  Graimer j\", p. 254; \"Lyverays for the Maister of Gramer[20] in  Housholde: Item Half a Loof of Houshold Breide, a Pottell of Beere, and  two White Lyghts,\" p. 97. \"Every Scolemaister techyng Grammer in the  Hous C _s_.\" (p. 47, 51). Edward IV.'s henxmen were taught grammar; and  if the Pastons are to be taken as a type of their class, our nobles and  gentry at the end of the 15th century must have been able to read and  write freely. Chaucer's Squire could write, and though the custom of  sealing deeds and not signing them prevailed, more or less, till Henry  VIII.'s time, it is doubtful whether this implied inability of the  sealers to write. Mr Chappell says that in Henry VIII.'s time half our  nobility were then writing ballads. Still, the bad spelling and grammar  of most of the letters up to that period, and the general ignorance of  our upper classes were, says Professor Brewer, the reason why the whole  government of the country was in the hands of ecclesiastics. Even in  Henry the Eighth's time, Sir Thomas Boleyn is said to have been the only  noble at Court who could speak French with any degree of fluency, and so  was learned enough to be sent on an embassy abroad. But this may be  questioned. Yet Wolsey, speaking to his Lord Chamberlain and Comptroller  when they      [Headnote: KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH.]      \"showed him that it seemed to them there should be some noblemen    and strangers [Henry VIII. and his courtiers masked] arrived at    his bridge, as ambassadors from some foreign prince. With that,    quoth the Cardinal, 'I shall desire you, _because ye can speak    French_, to take the pains to go down into the hall to encounter    and to receive them, according to their estates, and to conduct    them into this chamber' (_Cavendish_, p. 51). Then spake my Lord    Chamberlain unto them _in French_, declaring my Lord Cardinal's    mind (p. 53).\"    The general[21] opinion of our gentry as to the study of Letters, before  and about 1500 A.D., is probably well represented by the opinion of one  of them stated by Pace, in his Prefatory Letter to Colet, prefixed to  the former's _De Fructu_[22].      It remains that I now explain to you what moves me to compile and    publish a treatise with this title. When, two years ago, more or    less, I had returned to my native land from the city of Rome,    I was present at a certain feast, a stranger to many; where, when    enough had been drunk, one or other of the guests--no fool, as one    might infer from his words and countenance--began to talk of    educating his children well. And, first of all, he thought that he    must search out a good teacher for them, and that they should at    any rate attend school. There happened to be present one of those    whom we call gentle-men (_generosos_), and who always carry some    horn hanging at their backs, as though they would hunt during    dinner. He, hearing letters praised, roused with sudden anger,    burst out furiously with these words. \"Why do you talk nonsense,    friend?\" he said; \"A curse on those stupid letters! all learned    men are beggars: even Erasmus, the most learned of all, is a    beggar (as I hear), and in a certain letter of his calls +tên    kataraton penian+ (that is, execrable poverty) his wife, and    vehemently complains that he cannot shake her off his shoulders    right into +bathukêtea ponton+, that is, into the deep sea.    I swear by God's body I'd rather that my son should hang than    study letters. For it becomes the sons of gentlemen to blow the    horn nicely (_apte_), to hunt skilfully, and elegantly carry and    train a hawk. But the study of letters should be left to the sons    of rustics.\" At this point I could not restrain myself from    answering something to this most talkative man, in defence of good    letters. \"You do not seem to me, good man,\" I said, \"to think    rightly. For if any foreigner were to come to the king, such as    the ambassadors (_oratores_) of princes are, and an answer had to    be given to him, your son, if he were educated as you wish, could    only blow his horn, and the learned sons of rustics would be    called to answer, and would be far preferred to your hunter or    fowler son; and they, enjoying their learned liberty, would say to    your face, 'We prefer to be learned, and, thanks to our learning,    no fools, than boast of our fool-like nobility.'\" Then he upon    this, looking round, said, \"Who is this person that is talking    like this? I don't know the fellow.\" And when some one whispered    in his ear who I was, he muttered something or other in a low    voice to himself; and finding a fool to listen to him, he then    caught hold of a cup of wine. And when he could get nothing to    answer, he began to drink, and change the conversation to other    things. And thus I was freed from the disputing of this mad    fellow,--which I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24811"],[0,"Viking Tales (#9)"],[1," enough to hail them.    \"Where are you going?\" Ingolf would call.    \"To Norway,\" would come back the answer.    \"For trade or fight?\" Leif would shout.    Then would ring out a great laugh from that boat and this answer:    \"A shut mouth is a good friend.\"    So the two ships sailed on, and the men were glad to have heard a  greeting and to have called one.    But at last there were the Shetlands.    \"We will go in here and rest,\" Ingolf said.    When they rowed to shore a certain Shetland man stood there. He watched  them land and looked them all over. Then he walked up to Ingolf and  said:    \"You look like brave men. Welcome to Shetland. You shall come to my  house and rest your legs from ship-going and fill your stomachs. I  hunger for news of Norway.\"    So they went to his house and stayed there for three days. And good it  seemed to be near a fire and in a quiet bed and before a steaming  platter. When they went to the shore to start off again, the Shetland  man had his thralls carry a keg of ale and a great kettle of cooked meat  and put them into the ship.    \"Think of me when you eat this,\" he said.    Then the Norsemen put to sea again and sailed for a long time.    One day a terrible storm came up; the sky was black; the wind howled  through the ship. Great waves leaped in the sea.    \"Down with the sail and out with the oars!\" Ingolf shouted.    So the men furled the sail and took down the mast and laid it along the  bottom of the boat. As they worked, one man was washed overboard and  drowned. The men sat down to row, but the tumbling waves tossed the boat  about and poured over her and broke three of the oars. But still the men  held on. They were wet to the skin and were cold, and their arms and  legs ached with the hard work, and they were hungry from the long  waiting, but not one face was white with fear.    \"Ran, in her caves under sea, wants us for company to-night,\" Ingolf  laughed.    So they tossed about all night, but in the morning the wind died down.  Great waves still rolled, and for days the sea was rough, but they  could put up the sail. Then one day Leif, as he sat in the pilot's seat,  jumped to his feet and sang:        \"To eyes grown tired with looking far,      All at once appeared an island,      A stretching-place for sea-legs,      A quiet bed for backs grown stiff      On rowing-bench on rolling sea.      A place to build a red fire      And thaw the blood that sea-winds froze.\"    But when they came near they saw no place to land. The island was like a  mountain of rock standing out of the water. The sides were steep and  smooth. They sailed around it, but found no place to climb up.    \"There are many other islands here,\" said Leif. \"We will try another.\"    So he steered to another. It, too, was a steep rock, but one side sloped  down to the water and was green with grass.    \"Oh, I have not seen anything so good as that green grass since I looked  into my mother's face,\" one man said.    There was a little harbor there. The men rowed in and quickly jumped out  and put the rollers under the ship and pulled her upon shore. Then they  threw themselves down on the grass and rolled and stretched their arms  and shouted for joy. After that they built a fire and warmed themselves  and cooked a meal and ate like wolves. They slept there that night.    In the morning before Ingolf's men started away they were standing high  up on the hillside, looking about. They saw no houses on any of the  islands, but they saw smoke rise from one hillside.    \"Some other men, like us, weary of the sea and stopping to rest,\" said  Ingolf.    They saw the island that they had sailed around the night before.    \"There can surely be nothing but birds' nests on top of that,\" Sighvat  said.    \"Look!\" cried another, pointing.    Men were standing on the flat top of that island. They were letting a  boat down the steep side with ropes. When it struck the water, they made  a rope fast to the rock and slid down it into the ship and sailed off.    \"Some robber vikings from Scotland or Ireland,\" laughed Leif. \"It is a  good hiding place for treasure.\"    Soon Ingolf and his men got into their ship and were off. Old Sighvat  grumbled.    \"Is this land not new enough and empty enough and far enough? I am tired  of sea, sea, sea, and nothing else.\"    \"We started for Iceland,\" said Ingolf, \"and I will not stop before I  come there. I have a vow. Did you make none, Sighvat?\"    Then they were on the water again for weeks with no sight of land.    \"Oh! I would give my right hand to see a dragon pawing the water off  there and to fling a word to its men,\" Sighvat said.    \"No hope of that,\" replied Ingolf. \"Only three dragons before ours have  ever swept this water, and men are not sailing this way for pleasure or  riches.\"    So only the desolate sea stretched around them. Sometimes it was smooth  and shining under the sun. Often it was torn by winds, and a gray sky  hung over it, and the men were drenched with rain. Once they ran into a  fog. For three days and nights they could not see sun or stars to steer  by. They forgot which way was north. When after three days the fog  lifted, they found that they had been going in the wrong direction, and  they had to turn around and sail all that weary way over again. But at  last one afternoon they saw a white cloud resting on the water far off.  As they sailed toward it, it grew into long stretches of black, hilly  shore with a blue ice mountain rising from it. The sun was going down  behind that mountain, and long lines of pink and of shining green, and  great purple shadows streaked the blue.    \"It is Iceland!\" shouted the men.    \"It is like Asgard the Shining,\" Ingolf said.    But it was still far off. Men can see a long way there because the air  is so clear. So Ingolf and his people sailed on for hours and at last  came into a harbor. A little green valley sloped up from it. On one side  was the bright ice mountain. Back of it were bare black and red hills.  In that valley Ingolf and his men drew up their boat and camped. At  supper that night one of the men said:    \"I almost think I never felt a fire before or had warm food in my  mouth.\"    The men laughed.    \"It is four months since we left Norway,\" Ingolf said. \"Few men have  ever been on the sea so long.\"    That night they put up the awning in the boat and slept under it.    After that some men went fishing every day in the rowboat that they had.  And Ingolf took others, and they sailed along the shore, seeing what  kind of a land this was. But winter began to come on. Then Ingolf said:    \"Remember what Floki said of the ice and the rough sea in winter. Soon  we cannot sail any longer. Let us choose a place to stay and build a hut  there and cut hay for our cattle.\"    So they did. Their hut was a little mean thing of stones and turf. They  kept the cattle and the hay in it. Sometimes they slept there, when it  was very cold. But most of the time they ate and slept by a great  bonfire out of doors where it was clean. Leif said:    \"I like the cold air of the sea better than the bad-smelling air of a  house, even though it is warm.\"    Now every day Ingolf and Leif and some of the men walked about the  island. At night they all sat around the campfire and talked of what  they had seen during the day.    \"This is surely a wonderful land,\" Ingolf said once. \"It is at the same  time like Niflheim and like Asgard. Here is a spot green and soft, a  sweet cradle for men. Next it is a mountain of ice where men would  freeze to death. And next to that is a hill of rock that seems to have  come out of some great fire. Yesterday I saw a cave on the seashore. The  door of it was big enough for a giant. The waves broke at the doorstep.  A terrible roaring came from the cave. I think it is the home of a  giant. I think that giants of fire and giants of frost made this island.  I have seen great basins in the rocks filled with warm water. They  looked like giants' bath-tubs. I have seen boiling water shoot up out of  the ground. I have walked, and have felt and heard a great rumbling  under me as though some giant were sleeping there and turning over in  his sleep. One day I stood on a mountain and looked inland. There was a  wide desert of sand and black and red rock with nothing growing on it.  The fierce wind blew dirt into my eyes, and the cold of it froze the  marrow in my bones. When I have seen these things I have cursed the  country, and have said: 'The gods hate Iceland. I will not stay here.'  But then I have walked through beautiful warm valleys where the winds  did not come. I saw in my mind the flowers that we found last summer. I  saw our cattle feeding on the sweet grass. I thought of the sea full of  good fish. I saw my house built among green fields, and my wife sitting  in her home, and my children playing among the flowers and making up  tales about the bright ice mountains. I saw the wide, rough seas between  me and Harald and our foes. Then I thought to myself, 'It is the  sweetest home on earth.' As for me, I am coming here to live. What do  you say, comrades?\"    \"Have I not vowed to follow you, foster-brother?\" said Leif. \"And indeed  I never saw a land that I liked better. I don't believe in your giants.  My sword is my god, and my ship is my temple, and I like this land to  set them up in.\"    They sat about the fire long that night making plans.    \"You shall go home and get our women and our things, Ingolf,\" said Leif.  \"I will off to Ireland and have a frolic. There will be little play of  swords in this empty land, and I want to have one last game before I  hang up my battle-knife. Besides, I will come to you with a ship full of  gold and clothes and house-hangings such as we cannot get here, and they  will cost me nothing but the swing of a sword.\"    As they talked, Ingolf looked up at the sky. The northern lights were  quivering there. They were like great flames of yellow"]]]
