For he had other doubts besides those which held him in torment as to  his own salvation; he was in doubt about the whole framework of his  faith. Newman's conversion, he found, had meant something more to him  than he had first realised. It had seemed to come as a call to the  redoubling of his Anglican activities; but supposing, in reality, it  were a call towards something very different--towards an abandonment of  those activities altogether? It might be 'a trial', or again it might be  a 'leading'; how was he to judge? Already, before his illness, these  doubts had begun to take possession of his mind.    'I am conscious to myself,' he wrote in his Diary, 'of an extensively  changed feeling towards the Church of Rome ... The Church of England  seems to me to be diseased: 1. ORGANICALLY (six sub-headings). 2.  FUNCTIONALLY (seven sub-headings) ... Wherever it seems healthy, it  approximates the system of Rome.'    Then thoughts of the Virgin Mary suddenly began to assail him:        (1) If John the Baptist were sanctified from the womb,          how much more the B.V.!        (2) If Enoch and Elijah were exempted from death,          why not the B.V. from sin?        (3) It is a strange way of loving the Son to slight          the mother!'    The arguments seemed irresistible, and a few weeks later the following  entry occurs--'Strange thoughts have visited me:        (1) I have felt that the Episcopate of the Church of England is          secularised and bound down beyond hope....        (2) I feel as if a light had fallen upon me. My feeling about the          Roman Church is not intellectual. I have intellectual          difficulties, but the great moral difficulties seem melting.        (3) Something keeps rising and saying, \"You will end in the Roman          Church\".    He noted altogether twenty-five of these 'strange thoughts'. His mind  hovered anxiously round--        (1) The Incarnation,      (2) The Real Presence,             i. Regeneration,            ii. Eucharist, and      (3) The Exaltation of S. M. and Saints.    His twenty-second strange thought was as follows: 'How do I know where I  may be two years hence? Where was Newman five years ago?'    It was significant, but hardly surprising, that, after his illness,  Manning should have chosen to recuperate in Rome. He spent several  months there, and his Diary during the whole of that period is concerned  entirely with detailed descriptions of churches, ceremonies, and relics,  and with minute accounts of conversations with priests and nuns. There  is not a single reference either to the objects of art or to the  antiquities of the place; but another omission was still more  remarkable. Manning had a long interview with Pius IX, and his only  record of it is contained in the bald statement: 'Audience today at the  Vatican'. Precisely what passed on that occasion never transpired; all  that is known is that His Holiness expressed considerable surprise on  learning from the Archdeacon that the chalice was used in the Anglican  Church in the administration of Communion. 'What!' he exclaimed, is the  same chalice made use of by everyone?' 'I remember the pain I felt,'  said Manning, long afterwards, 'at seeing how unknown we were to the  Vicar of Jesus Christ. It made me feel our isolation.'    On his return to England, he took up once more the work in his  Archdeaconry with what appetite he might. Ravaged by doubt, distracted  by speculation, he yet managed to maintain an outward presence of  unshaken calm. His only confidant was Robert Wilberforce, to whom, for  the next two years, he poured forth in a series of letters, headed  'UNDER THE SEAL' to indicate that they contained the secrets of the  confessional--the whole history of his spiritual perturbations. The  irony of his position was singular; for, during the whole of this time,  Manning was himself holding back from the Church of Rome a host of  hesitating penitents by means of arguments which he was at the very  moment denouncing as fallacious to his own confessor. But what else  could he do? When he received, for instance, a letter such as the  following from an agitated lady, what was he to say?    'MY DEAR FATHER IN CHRIST,    ' ... I am sure you would pity me and like to help me, if you knew the  unhappy, unsettled state my mind is in, and the misery of being  ENTIRELY, WHEREVER I AM, with those who look upon joining the Church of  Rome as the most awful \"fall\" conceivable to any one, and are devoid of  the smallest comprehension of how any enlightened person can do it....  My old Evangelical friends, with all my deep, deep love for them, do not  succeed in shaking me in the least....    'My brother has just published a book called \"Regeneration\", which all  my friends are reading and highly extolling; it has a very contrary  effect to what he would desire on my mind. I can read and understand it  all in an altogether different sense, and the facts which he quotes  about the articles as drawn up in 1536, and again in 1552, and of the  Irish articles of 1615 and 1634, STARTLE and SHAKE me about the Reformed  Church in England far more than anything else, and have done so ever  since I first saw them in Mr. Maskell's pamphlet (as quoted from Mr  Dodsworth's).    'I do hope you have some time and thought to pray for me still. Mr.  Galton's letters long ago grew into short formal notes, which hurt me  and annoyed me particularly, and I never answered his last, so,  literally, I have no one to say things to and get help from, which in  one sense is a comfort when my convictions seem to be leading me on and  on, and gaining strength in spite of all the dreariness of my lot.    'Do you know I can't help being very anxious and unhappy about poor  Sister Harriet. I am afraid of her GOING OUT OF HER MIND. She comforts  herself by an occasional outpouring of everything to me, and I had a  letter this morning.... She says Sister May has promised the Vicar never  to talk to her or allow her to talk on the subject with her, and I doubt  whether this can be good for her, because though she has lost her faith,  she says, in the Church of England, yet she never thinks of what she  could have faith in, and resolutely without inquiring into the question  determines not to be a Roman Catholic, so that really, you see, she is  allowing her mind to run adrift and yet perfectly powerless.    'Forgive my troubling you with this letter, and believe me to be always  your faithful, grateful and affectionate daughter,    'EMMA RYLE.    'P.S. I wish I could see you once more so very much.'    How was Manning, a director of souls, and a clergyman of the Church of  England, to reply that in sober truth there was very little to choose  between the state of mind of Sister Emma, or even of Sister Harriet, and  his own? The dilemma was a grievous one: when a soldier finds himself  fighting for a cause in which he has lost faith, it is treachery to  stop, and it is treachery to go on.    At last, in the seclusion of his library, Manning turned in agony to  those old writings which had provided Newman with so much instruction  and assistance; perhaps the Fathers would do something for him as well.  He ransacked the pages of St. Cyprian and St. Cyril; he went through the  complete works of St. Optatus and St. Leo; he explored the vast  treatises of Tertullian and Justin Martyr. He had a lamp put into his  phaeton, so that he might lose no time during his long winter drives.  There he sat, searching St. Chrysostom for some mitigation of his  anguish, while he sped along between the hedges to distant sufferers, to  whom he duly administered the sacraments according to the rites of the  English Church. He hurried back to commit to his Diary the analysis of  his reflections, and to describe, under the mystic formula of secrecy,  the intricate workings of his conscience to Robert Wilberforce. But,  alas! he was no Newman; and even the fourteen folios of St. Augustine  himself, strange to say, gave him very little help.    The final propulsion was to come from an entirely different quarter. In  November, 1847, the Reverend Mr. Gorham was presented by the Lord  Chancellor to the living of Bramford Speke in the diocese of Exeter. The  Bishop, Dr. Phillpotts, was a High Churchman, and he had reason to  believe that Mr. Gorham held evangelical opinions; he therefore  subjected him to an examination on doctrine, which took the form partly  of a verbal interrogatory, lasting thirty-eight hours, and partly of a  series of one hundred and forty-nine written questions. At the end of  the examination he came to the conclusion that Mr. Gorham held heretical  views on the subject of Baptismal Regeneration, and he therefore refused  to institute. Mr. Gorham, thereupon, took proceedings against the Bishop  in the Court of Arches. He lost his case; and he then appealed to the  judicial Committee of the Privy Council.    The questions at issue were taken very seriously by a large number of  persons. In the first place, there was the question of Baptismal  Regeneration itself. This is by no means an easy one to disentangle; but  it may be noted that the doctrine of Baptism includes: (1) God's  intention, that is to say, His purpose in electing certain persons to  eternal life--an abstruse and greatly controverted subject, upon which  the Church of England abstains from strict definition; (2) God's action,  whether by means of sacraments or otherwise--concerning which the Church  of England maintains the efficacy of sacraments,' but does not formally  deny that grace may be given by other means, repentance and faith being  present; and (3) the question whether sacramental grace is given  instrumentally, by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#9)"],[1,"t. For it is precisely to those who are most  likely to err by temperament, ignorance, or folly, that the  threats of the law are the most dangerous.    The reconciliation of the doctrine that liability is founded on  blameworthiness with the existence of liability where the party  is not to blame, will be worked out more fully in the next  Lecture. It is found in the conception of the average man, the  man of ordinary intelligence and reasonable prudence. Liability  is said to arise out of such conduct as would be blameworthy in  him. But he is an ideal being, represented by the jury when they  are appealed to, and his conduct is an external or objective  standard when applied to any given individual. That individual  may be morally without stain, because he has less than ordinary  intelligence or prudence. But he is required to have those  qualities at his peril. If he has them, he will not, as a general  rule, incur liability without blameworthiness.    The next step is to take up some crimes in detail, and to  discover what analysis will teach with regard to them.    I will begin with murder. Murder is defined by Sir James Stephen,  in his Digest of Criminal Law, /1/ as unlawful homicide with  malice aforethought. In his earlier work, /2/ he explained that  malice meant wickedness, and that the law had determined what  states of mind were wicked in the necessary degree. Without the  same preliminary he continues in his Digest as follows:--    [52] \"Malice aforethought means any one or more of the following  states of mind..... \"(a.) An intention to cause the death of, or  grievous bodily harm to, any person, whether such person is the  person actually killed or not; \"(b.) Knowledge that the act which  causes death will probably cause the death of, or grievous bodily  harm to, some person, whether such person is the person actually  killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by  indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or  not, or by a wish that it may not be caused; \"(c.) An intent to  commit any felony whatever; \"(d.) An intent to oppose by force  any officer of justice on his way to, in, or returning from the  execution of the duty of arresting, keeping in custody, or  imprisoning any person whom he is lawfully entitled to arrest,  keep in custody, or imprison, or the duty of keeping the peace or  dispersing an unlawful assembly, provided that the offender has  notice that the person killed is such an officer so employed.\"    Malice, as used in common speech, includes intent, and something  more. When an act is said to be done with an intent to do harm,  it is meant that a wish for the harm is the motive of the act.  Intent, however, is perfectly consistent with the harm being  regretted as such, and being wished only as a means to something  else. But when an act is said to be done maliciously, it is  meant, not only that a wish for the harmful effect is the motive,  but also that the harm is wished for its own sake, or, as Austin  would say with more accuracy, for the sake of the pleasurable  feeling which knowledge of the suffering caused by the act would  excite. Now it is apparent from Sir James [53] Stephen's  enumeration, that of these two elements of malice the intent  alone is material to murder. It is just as much murder to shoot a  sentry for the purpose of releasing a friend, as to shoot him  because you hate him. Malice, in the definition of murder, has  not the same meaning as in common speech, and, in view of the  considerations just mentioned, it has been thought to mean  criminal intention. /1/    But intent again will be found to resolve itself into two things;  foresight that certain consequences will follow from an act, and  the wish for those consequences working as a motive which induces  the act. The question then is, whether intent, in its turn,  cannot be reduced to a lower term. Sir James Stephen's statement  shows that it can be, and that knowledge that the act will  probably cause death, that is, foresight of the consequences of  the act, is enough in murder as in tort.    For instance, a newly born child is laid naked out of doors,  where it must perish as a matter of course. This is none the less  murder, that the guilty party would have been very glad to have a  stranger find the child and save it. /2/    But again, What is foresight of consequences? It is a picture of  a future state of things called up by knowledge of the present  state of things, the future being viewed as standing to the  present in the relation of effect to cause. Again, we must seek a  reduction to lower terms. If the known present state of things is  such that the act done will very certainly cause death, and the  probability is a matter of common knowledge, one who does the  act, [54] knowing the present state of things, is guilty of  murder, and the law will not inquire whether he did actually  foresee the consequences or not. The test of foresight is not  what this very criminal foresaw, but what a man of reasonable  prudence would have foreseen.    On the other hand, there must be actual present knowledge of the  present facts which make an act dangerous. The act is not enough  by itself. An act, it is true, imports intention in a certain  sense. It is a muscular contraction, and something more. A spasm  is not an act. The contraction of the muscles must be willed. And  as an adult who is master of himself foresees with mysterious  accuracy the outward adjustment which will follow his inward  effort, that adjustment may be said to be intended. But the  intent necessarily accompanying the act ends there. Nothing would  follow from the act except for the environment. All acts, taken  apart from their surrounding circumstances, are indifferent to  the law. For instance, to crook the forefinger with a certain  force is the same act whether the trigger of a pistol is next to  it or not. It is only the surrounding circumstances of a pistol  loaded and cocked, and of a human being in such relation to it,  as to be manifestly likely to be hit, that make the act a wrong.  Hence, it is no sufficient foundation for liability, on any sound  principle, that the proximate cause of loss was an act.    The reason for requiring an act is, that an act implies a choice,  and that it is felt to be impolitic and unjust to make a man  answerable for harm, unless he might have chosen otherwise. But  the choice must be made with a chance of contemplating the  consequence complained of, or else it has no bearing on  responsibility for that consequence. [55] If this were not true,  a man might be held answerable for everything which would not  have happened but for his choice at some past time. For instance,  for having in a fit fallen on a man, which he would not have done  had he not chosen to come to the city where he was taken ill.    All foresight of the future, all choice with regard to any  possible consequence of action, depends on what is known at the  moment of choosing. An act cannot be wrong, even when done under  circumstances in which it will be hurtful, unless those  circumstances are or ought to be known. A fear of punishment for  causing harm cannot work as a motive, unless the possibility of  harm may be foreseen. So far, then, as criminal liability is  founded upon wrong-doing in any sense, and so far as the threats  and punishments of the law are intended to deter men from  bringing about various harmful results, they must be confined to  cases where circumstances making the conduct dangerous were  known.    Still, in a more limited way, the same principle applies to  knowledge that applies to foresight. It is enough that such  circumstances were actually known as would have led a man of  common understanding to infer from them the rest of the group  making up the present state of things. For instance, if a workman  on a house-top at mid-day knows that the space below him is a  street in a great city, he knows facts from which a man of common  understanding would infer that there were people passing below.  He is therefore bound to draw that inference, or, in other words,  is chargeable with knowledge of that fact also, whether he draws  the inference or not. If then, he throws down a heavy beam into  the street, he does an act [56] which a person of ordinary  prudence would foresee is likely to cause death, or grievous  bodily harm, and he is dealt with as if he foresaw it, whether he  does so in fact or not. If a death is caused by the act, he is  guilty of murder. /1/ But if the workman has reasonable cause to  believe that the space below is a private yard from which every  one is excluded, and which is used as a rubbish heap, his act is  not blameworthy, and the homicide is a mere misadventure.    To make an act which causes death murder, then, the actor ought,  on principle, to know, or have notice of the facts which make the  act dangerous. There are certain exceptions to this principle  which will be stated presently, but they have less application to  murder than to some smaller statutory crimes. The general rule  prevails for the most part in murder.    But furthermore, on the same principle, the danger which in fact  exists under the known circumstances ought to be of a class which  a man of reasonable prudence could foresee. Ignorance of a fact  and inability to foresee a consequence have the same effect on  blameworthiness. If a consequence cannot be foreseen, it cannot  be avoided. But there is this practical difference, that whereas,  in most cases, the question of knowledge is a question of the  actual condition of the defendant's consciousness, the question  of what he might have foreseen is determined by the standard of  the prudent man, that is, by general experience. For it is to be  remembered that the object of the law is to prevent human life  being endangered or taken; and that, although it so far considers  blameworthiness in punishing as not to "]]]
