And so the first apparent physical sign of puberty in a girl is the  gradual appearance of hair in the armpits, on the mons Veneris and the  labia majora. But all the genital organs are undergoing rapid  development; the vulva, the vagina, the uterus and the ovaries become  larger, and the ovaries which up to that time were elaborating an  internal secretion only, now also begin to manufacture ova; in other  words, the monthly process of ovulation is begun. Synchronously with  the process of ovulation, there commences the monthly function of  menstruation. The breasts also increase in size, assume the  characteristic contour, develop their glandular substance, and become  capable of secreting milk for the use of any possible offspring.  During this period of development they are often very sensitive to the  touch or feel painful without being touched.    But not only the genital organs undergo growth and development--the  entire body participates in the process. The growth in height is the  most rapid at this period; the greatest growth takes place in the  limbs--legs and arms. The pelvis becomes broader, and the chest or  thorax also becomes broader and larger. The muscles become larger and  rounder and finally give the girl the beautiful womanly form.    =Psychic Changes.= But the changes are not only physical; the changes  that take place in the girl's psychic sphere during the pubertal years  are also highly important. That is the period of the development of  the emotions; she is overflowing with emotion; she becomes sensitive;  in her relations with boys and men she becomes self-conscious.  Distinct sexual desire fortunately does not make its appearance in the  girl at this period, as it does in the boy, but she becomes filled  with vague undefined and undefinable longings. It is the period of  \"crushes\" when the girl is apt to bestow her overflowing emotion on a  girl friend. There is nothing reprehensible in these crushes--they  act as a safety valve--and only in rare cases are they apt to lead to  abnormal development. This is also the period of day-dreaming and of  romancing; the girl likes to read love-stories and novels in which she  identifies herself with the heroine. And it makes quite some  difference as to what the girl reads during this period, for  literature has a strong influence on the young in the most plastic  period of their lives; and it is important that older persons see to  it that those in their care spend their time on books of noble ideals  and high artistic value.    Girls of a highly sensitive or so-called \"nervous\" temperament,  especially if there is \"nervousness\" in the family, must be  particularly looked after. For it is during the years of puberty and  adolescence that any neurotic traits are apt to develop and become  emphasized. It is also the period when bad sexual habits  (masturbation) are apt to develop, and the careful mother will devote  special attention to her girls in their years of puberty, and guard  them as much as possible against physical and emotional shocks.    The age of puberty in girls is by many writers considered as  synonymous or synchronous with the onset of menstruation, which in  this country in the majority of cases occurs between the ages of  thirteen and fourteen. The year of gradual development before the  onset of menstruation is by some referred to as the pre-pubertal year;  and the first year after the onset of menstruation is the  post-pubertal year. The period from puberty to full sexual maturity is  called adolescence, and this term is applied generally to the period  between thirteen and eighteen. For at eighteen the boy and the girl  have reached full maturity. Mentally we acquire things as long as we  live, and even physically the body gets larger for some years after  eighteen. But sexually both boys and girls are fully mature at  eighteen, though in order to become parents it is best, for various  reasons, to wait to the ages of twenty or twenty-five.    =Nubility.= Nubility is the age or state when a boy or a girl is \"fit\"  for marriage. This is a vague and unsatisfactory term. At the age of  thirteen to fifteen boys and girls are physically \"fit\" for marriage,  that is at that age a boy is capable of begetting and a girl of having  children. But it does not mean that it would be advisable for them to  marry at such an early age. Neither their bodies nor their minds are  fully developed, and children begotten of such young parents are apt  to be weaklings, both mentally and physically. The youngest age for  girls to marry should be eighteen, and for boys twenty; but the  youngest age for becoming parents should be twenty to twenty-two for  the mother and twenty-three to twenty-five for the father.          CHAPTER SIX    MENSTRUATION     Definition of Menstruation--Where Menstrual Blood Comes From--Age    of Menstruation--Age of Cessation of    Menstruation--Duration--Amount--Regularity and Irregularity.      The first function with which the girl will be confronted, which will  impress upon her that she is a creature of sex, that she is decidedly  different from the boy, is _menstruation_. And this function we will  now proceed to study.    What is menstruation? Menstruation is a monthly discharge of blood.  The word is derived from the Latin word mensis, which means a month;  and menstruation is also frequently spoken of as _the menses_. It is  also called the catamenia or catamenia-flow (Greek, kata--by, men--a  month). Other terms are: the periods, courses, monthlies, turns,  monthly changes, monthly sickness, sickness, flowers, to be unwell, to  be regular. \"Not to see anything\" is a common term for having missed  the menses. This flow of blood recurs in most cases with remarkable  regularity once a month; not a calendar month, but once a lunar month,  i.e., once every twenty-eight days. And as there are thirteen lunar  months a year, a woman menstruates not twelve but thirteen times a  year.    Where does the menstrual blood come from? The menstrual blood comes  from the inside of the womb. Every month, for a few days prior to  menstruation, the inside lining of the womb (what we call the mucous  membrane or endometrium) becomes congested and its bloodvessels become  distended with blood. If the woman has sexual intercourse and  pregnancy happens to take place, then this extra blood is used to  nourish and develop the new child; but if no pregnancy takes place,  that extra blood exudes from the bloodvessels (some of the  bloodvessels rupture) and is discharged from the uterus into the  vagina, and from there to the outside, where it is caught on cotton,  sanitary napkins or some other pad.    =At what age does menstruation begin?= The usual age at which  menstruation begins in this country is thirteen or fourteen; in some  it may occur as early as twelve, in others as late as fifteen, sixteen  or even seventeen. For menstruation to begin earlier than twelve or  later than seventeen is in this country a rare exception. But in cold  northern climates the age of eighteen is not rare, and in the hot  southern climates menstruation often starts at the ages of ten or  eleven. Change of climate or of country will often have an influence  on the menses. In the early years of his medical practice, the author  had many Finnish girls as patients. It was a very common occurrence  for them to stop menstruating for the first few months or even for the  first year of their residence in this country.    =At what age does menstruation cease?= The age at which menstruation  ceases is called the _menopause_ or _climacteric_. It usually takes  place at the age of forty-eight or fifty. In some cases it does not  take place until the age of fifty-two, in others it takes place as  early as forty-five or forty-four. In general, it may be said that the  woman's menstruating period, during which she is able to have  children, lasts about thirty-five years. And if no restraint be taken,  and if no precautions be taken against conception, a woman could have  twenty or thirty children during her childbearing period.    =How many days does a woman menstruate?= The usual number of days is  from three to five; in some cases menstruation lasts only two days, in  others as long as seven. As a rule, the greatest amount of blood  passed is during the first two days.    =The amount of blood.= It is hard to estimate the exact amount of  blood passed by a woman during her menses, but it reaches about an  ounce and a half to three ounces. In some women the amount may reach  as much as four or five ounces and in exceptional cases as much as  eight ounces. Where it exceeds this amount, it is an abnormal  condition, requiring treatment. The usual statement that a normally  menstruating woman should not have to use more than three napkins  during the twenty-four hours is correct.    _The periodical regularity_ with which menstruation recurs in many  women is remarkable. I know a woman who has not missed her menses in  twenty years; during those twenty years the menses have started every  fourth Friday, almost always at the same hour. I know another one who  has her menses every fourth Wednesday, about seven in the morning. She  skipped her periods during her two pregnancies, then they were  irregular for a while, then they came back to Wednesday. Other women  have their menses on a certain day of the month, say the first or the  fifth, regardless of the number of days in the month (such cases are,  however, exceptional). And in some women the menses are irregular:  every three weeks, every five or six weeks, every six or seven weeks,  etc. Some women never know when they may expect their menses, so  irregular they are.
