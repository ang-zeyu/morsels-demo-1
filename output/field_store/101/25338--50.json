I wuz borned in  Virginia as yo' mought say ter my marster Mr. S. L. Allen.    We moved when I wuz little ter Durham County whar we fared bad. We  ain't had nothin' much ter eat an' ter w'ar. He had a hundert slaves an'  I reckon five hundert acres o' lan'. He made us wuck hard, de little  ones included.    One night I lay down on de straw mattress wid my mammy, an' de nex'  mo'nin' I woked up an' she wuz gone. When I axed 'bout her I fin's dat a  speculator comed dar de night before an' wanted ter buy a 'oman. Dey had  come an' got my mammy widout wakin' me up. I has always been glad  somehow dat I wuz asleep.    Dey uster tie me ter a tree an' beat me till de blood run down my back,  I doan 'member nothin' dat I done, I jist 'members de whuppin's. Some  of de rest wuz beat wuser dan I wuz too, an' I uster scream dat I wuz  sho' dyin'.    Yes'um I seed de Yankees go by, but dey ain't bodder us none, case dey  knows dat 'hind eber' bush jist about a Confederate soldier pints a gun.    I warn't glad at de surrender, case I doan understand hit, an' de  Allen's keeps me right on, an' whups me wuser den dan eber.    I reckon I wuz twelve years old when my mammy come ter de house an'  axes Mis' Allen ter let me go spen' de week en' wid her. Mis' Allen  can't say no, case Mammy mought go ter de carpet baggers so she lets me  go fer de week-en'. Mammy laughs Sunday when I says somethin' 'bout  goin' back.

C.  Johnston County.      I belonged ter Mr. Bob Lumsford hyar in Smithfield from de time of my  birth. My mammy wuz named Candice an' my pappy's name wuz Seth. My  brothers wuz Rufus, William an' George, an' my sisters wuz Mary an'  Laura.    I 'minds me of de days when as a youngin' [HW correction: youngun'] I  played marbles an' hide an' seek. Dar wuzn't many games den, case nobody  ain't had no time fer 'em. De grown folkses had dances an' sometimes  co'n shuckin's, an' de little niggers patted dere feets at de dances an'  dey he'p ter shuck de co'n. At Christmas we had a big dinner, an' from  den through New Year's Day we feast, an' we dance, an' we sing. De fust  one what said Christmas gift ter anybody else got a gif', so of cou'se  we all try ter ketch de marster.    On de night 'fore de first day of Jinuary we had a dance what lasts all  night. At midnight when de New Year comes in marster makes a speech an'  we is happy dat he thanks us fer our year's wuck an' says dat we is  good, smart slaves.    Marster wucked his niggers from daylight till dark, an' his thirteen  grown slaves had ter ten' 'bout three hundred acres o' land. Course dey  mostly planted co'n, peas an' vege'ables.    I can 'member, do' I wuz small, dat de slaves wuz whupped fer  disobeyin' an' I can think of seberal dat I got. I wuz doin' housewuck  at de time an' one of de silber knives got misplaced. Dey 'cused me of  misplacin' it on purpose, so I got de wust beatin' dat I eber had. I wuz  beat den till de hide wuz busted hyar an' dar.    We little ones had some time ter go swimmin' an' we did; we also  fished, an' at night we hunted de possum an' de coon sometimes. Ole  Uncle Jeems had some houn's what would run possums or coons an' he uster  take we boys 'long wid him.    I 'members onct de houn's struck a trail an' dey tree de coon. Uncle  Jeems sen's Joe, who wuz bigger den I wuz, up de tree ter ketch de coon  an' he warns him dat coons am fightin' fellers. Joe doan pay much mind  he am so happy ter git der chanct ter ketch de coon, but when he ketched  dat coon he couldn't turn loose, an' from de way he holler yo' would  s'pose dat he ain't neber wanted ter ketch a coon. When Joe Barbour wuz  buried hyar las' winter dem coon marks wuz still strong on his arms an'  han's an' dar wuz de long scar on his face.    I 'members onct a Yankee 'oman from New York looks at him an' nigh  'bout faints. 'I reckon', says she, dat am what de cruel slave owner or  driver done ter him'.    Yes mam, I knows when de Yankees comed ter Smithfield. Dey comed wid de  beatin' of drums an' de wavin' of flags. Dey says dat our governor wuz  hyar makin' a speech but he flewed 'fore dey got hyar. Anyhow, we libed  off from de main path of march, an' so we ain't been trouble so much  'cept by 'scootin' parties, as my ole missus call' em.    Dey am de darndest yo' eber seed, dey won't eat no hog meat 'cept hams  an' shoulders an' dey goes ter de smoke house an' gits 'em 'thout no  permission. Dey has what dey calls rammin' rods ter dere guns an' dey  knock de chickens in de haid wid dat. I hyard dem say dat dar warn't no  use wastin' powder on dem chickens.    Dey went ober de neighborhood stealin' an' killin' stock. I hyard 'bout  'em ketchin' a pig, cuttin' off his hams an' leave him dar alive. De  foun' all de things we done hid, not dat I thinks dat dey am witches,  but dat dey has a money rod, an' 'cides dat some of de slaves tol' 'em  whar marster had hid de things.    Yes 'um, I reckon I wuz glad ter git free, case I knows den dat I won't  wake up some mornin' ter fin' dat my mammy or some ob de rest of my  family am done sold. I left de day I hyard 'bout de surrender an' I  fared right good too, do' I knows dem what ain't farin' so well.    I ain't neber learn ter read an' write an' I knows now dat I neber  will. I can't eben write a letter ter Raleigh 'bout my ole man's  pension.    I 'members de days when mammy wored a blue hankerchief 'round her haid  an' cooked in de great house. She'd sometimes sneak me a cookie or a  cobbler an' fruits. She had her own little gyardin an' a few chickens  an' we w'oud ov been happy 'cept dat we wuz skeered o' bein' sold.    I'se glad dat slavery am ober, case now de nigger has got a chanct ter  live an' larn wid de whites. Dey won't neber be as good as de whites but  dey can larn ter live an' enjoy life more.    Speakin' 'bout de Ku Klux dey ain't do nothin' but scare me back in  '69, but iffen we had some now I thinks dat some of dese young niggers  what has forgot what dey mammies tol' 'em would do better.

Bloodworth Street, Raleigh,  N. C.      I reckon dat I wuz borned in McDowell County, case dat's whar my mammy,  Edith, lived. She 'longed ter Mr. Jefferson Mitchel dar, an' my pappy  'longed ter er Mr. Jordan in Avery County, so he said.    'Fore de war, I doan know nothin' much 'cept dat we lived on a big  plantation an' dat my mammy wucked hard, but wuz treated pretty good.    We had our little log cabin off ter one side, an' my mammy had sixteen  chilluns. Fas' as dey got three years old de marster sol' 'em till we  las' four dat she had wid her durin' de war. I wuz de oldes' o' dese  four; den dar wuz Henry an' den de twins, Liza an' Charlie.    One of de fust things dat I 'members wuz my pappy wakin' me up in de  middle o' de night, dressin' me in de dark, all de time tellin' me ter  keep quiet. One o' de twins hollered some an' pappy put his hand ober  its mouth ter keep it quiet.    Atter we wuz dressed he went outside an' peeped roun' fer a minute den  he comed back an' got us. We snook out o' de house an' long de woods  path, pappy totin' one of de twins an' holdin' me by de han' an' mammy  carryin' de udder two.    I reckons dat I will always 'member dat walk, wid de bushes slappin' my  laigs, de win' sighin' in de trees, an' de hoot owls an' whippoorwills  hollerin' at each other frum de big trees. I wuz half asleep an' skeered  stiff, but in a little while we pass de plum' thicket an' dar am de  mules an' wagin.    Dar am er quilt in de bottom o' de wagin, an' on dis dey lays we  youngins. An' pappy an' mammy gits on de board cross de front an' drives  off down de road.    I wuz sleepy but I wuz skeered too, so as we rides 'long I lis'ens ter  pappy an' mammy talk. Pappy wuz tellin' mammy 'bout de Yankees comin'  ter dere plantation, burnin' de co'n cribs, de smokehouses an' 'stroyin'  eber'thing. He says right low dat dey done took marster Jordan ter de  Rip Raps down nigh Norfolk, an' dat he stol' de mules an' wagin an'  'scaped.    We wuz skeerd of de Yankees ter start wid, but de more we thinks 'bout  us runnin' way frum our marsters de skeerder we gits o' de Rebs. Anyhow  pappy says dat we is goin' ter jine de Yankees.    We trabels all night an' hid in de woods all day fer a long time, but  atter awhile we gits ter Doctor Dillard's place, in Chowan County. I  reckons dat we stays dar seberal days.    De Yankees has tooked dis place so we stops ober, an' has a heap o' fun  dancin' an' sich while we am dar. De Yankees tells pappy ter head fer  New Bern an' dat he will be took keer of dar, so ter New Bern we goes.    When we gits ter New Bern de Yankees takes de mules an' wagin, dey  tells pappy something, an' he puts us on a long white boat named Ocean  Waves an' ter Roanoke we goes.

[36:1] Plea for the West (Cincinnati, 1835), pp. 11 ff.    [37:1] Colonial travelers agree in remarking on the phlegmatic  characteristics of the colonists. It has frequently been asked how such  a people could have developed that strained nervous energy now  characteristic of them. Compare Sumner, \"Alexander Hamilton,\" p. 98, and  Adams, \"History of the United States,\" i, p. 60; ix, pp. 240, 241. The  transition appears to become marked at the close of the War of 1812, a  period when interest centered upon the development of the West, and the  West was noted for restless energy. Grund, \"Americans,\" ii, ch. i.          II    THE FIRST OFFICIAL FRONTIER OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY[39:1]      In the Significance of the \"Frontier in American History,\" I took for my  text the following announcement of the Superintendent of the Census of  1890:         Up to and including 1880 the country had a frontier of       settlement but at present the unsettled area has been so       broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that there can       hardly be said to be a frontier line. In the discussion of its       extent, the westward movement, etc., it cannot therefore any       longer have a place in the census reports.    Two centuries prior to this announcement, in 1690, a committee of the  General Court of Massachusetts recommended the Court to order what shall  be the frontier and to maintain a committee to settle garrisons on the  frontier with forty soldiers to each frontier town as a main  guard.[39:2] In the two hundred years between this official attempt to  locate the Massachusetts frontier line, and the official announcement of  the ending of the national frontier line, westward expansion was the  most important single process in American history.    The designation \"frontier town\" was not, however, a new one. As early as  1645 inhabitants of Concord, Sudbury, and Dedham, \"being inland townes  & but thinly peopled,\" were forbidden to remove without authority;[40:1]  in 1669, certain towns had been the subject of legislation as \"frontier  towns;\"[40:2] and in the period of King Philip's War there were various  enactments regarding frontier towns.[40:3] In the session of 1675-6 it  had been proposed to build a fence of stockades or stone eight feet high  from the Charles \"where it is navigable\" to the Concord at Billerica and  thence to the Merrimac and down the river to the Bay, \"by which meanes  that whole tract will [be] environed, for the security & safty (vnder  God) of the people, their houses, goods & cattel; from the rage & fury  of the enimy.\"[40:4] This project, however, of a kind of Roman Wall did  not appeal to the frontiersmen of the time. It was a part of the  antiquated ideas of defense which had been illustrated by the impossible  equipment of the heavily armored soldier of the early Puritan regime  whose corslets and head pieces, pikes, matchlocks, fourquettes and  bandoleers, went out of use about the period of King Philip's War. The  fifty-seven postures provided in the approved manual of arms for loading  and firing the matchlock proved too great a handicap in the chase of the  nimble savage. In this era the frontier fighter adapted himself to a  more open order, and lighter equipment suggested by the Indian warrior's  practice.[40:5]    The settler on the outskirts of Puritan civilization took up the task of  bearing the brunt of attack and pushing forward the line of advance  which year after year carried American settlements into the wilderness.  In American thought and speech the term \"frontier\" has come to mean the  edge of settlement, rather than, as in Europe, the political boundary.  By 1690 it was already evident that the frontier of settlement and the  frontier of military defense were coinciding. As population advanced  into the wilderness and thus successively brought new exposed areas  between the settlements on the one side and the Indians with their  European backers on the other, the military frontier ceased to be  thought of as the Atlantic coast, but rather as a moving line bounding  the un-won wilderness. It could not be a fortified boundary along the  charter limits, for those limits extended to the South Sea, and  conflicted with the bounds of sister colonies. The thing to be defended  was the outer edge of this expanding society, a changing frontier, one  that needed designation and re-statement with the changing location of  the \"West.\"    It will help to illustrate the significance of this new frontier when we  see that Virginia at about the same time as Massachusetts underwent a  similar change and attempted to establish frontier towns, or  \"co-habitations,\" at the \"heads,\" that is the first falls, the vicinity  of Richmond, Petersburg, etc., of her rivers.[41:1]    The Virginia system of \"particular plantations\" introduced along the  James at the close of the London Company's activity had furnished a type  for the New England town. In recompense, at this later day the New  England town may have furnished a model for Virginia's efforts to create  frontier settlements by legislation.    An act of March 12, 1694-5, by the General Court of Massachusetts  enumerated the \"Frontier Towns\" which the inhabitants were forbidden to  desert on pain of loss of their lands (if landholders) or of  imprisonment (if not landholders), unless permission to remove were  first obtained.[42:1] These eleven frontier towns included Wells, York,  and Kittery on the eastern frontier, and Amesbury, Haverhill, Dunstable,  Chelmsford, Groton, Lancaster, Marlborough,[42:2] and Deerfield. In  March, 1699-1700, the law was reenacted with the addition of Brookfield,  Mendon, and Woodstock, together with seven others, Salisbury,  Andover,[42:3] Billerica, Hatfield, Hadley, Westfield, and Northampton,  which, \"tho' they be not frontiers as those towns first named, yet lye  more open than many others to an attack of an Enemy.\"[42:4]    In the spring of 1704 the General Court of Connecticut, following  closely the act of Massachusetts, named as her frontier towns, not to  be deserted, Symsbury, Waterbury, Danbury, Colchester, Windham,  Mansfield, and Plainfield.    Thus about the close of the seventeenth and the beginning of the  eighteenth century there was an officially designated frontier line for  New England. The line passing through these enumerated towns represents:  (1) the outskirts of settlement along the eastern coast and up the  Merrimac and its tributaries,--a region threatened from the Indian  country by way of the Winnepesaukee Lake; (2) the end of the ribbon of  settlement up the Connecticut Valley, menaced by the Canadian Indians by  way of the Lake Champlain and Winooski River route to the Connecticut;  (3) boundary towns which marked the edges of that inferior agricultural  region, where the hard crystalline rocks furnished a later foundation  for Shays' Rebellion, opposition to the adoption of the Federal  Constitution, and the abandoned farm; and (4) the isolated intervale of  Brookfield which lay intermediate between these frontiers.    Besides this New England frontier there was a belt of settlement in New  York, ascending the Hudson to where Albany and Schenectady served as  outposts against the Five Nations, who menaced the Mohawk, and against  the French and the Canadian Indians, who threatened the Hudson by way of  Lake Champlain and Lake George.[43:1] The sinister relations of leading  citizens of Albany engaged in the fur trade with these Indians, even  during time of war, tended to protect the Hudson River frontier at the  expense of the frontier towns of New England.    The common sequence of frontier types (fur trader, cattle-raising  pioneer, small primitive farmer, and the farmer engaged in intensive  varied agriculture to produce a surplus for export) had appeared, though  confusedly, in New England. The traders and their posts had prepared the  way for the frontier towns,[44:1] and the cattle industry was most  important to the early farmers.[44:2] But the stages succeeded rapidly  and intermingled. After King Philip's War, while Albany was still in the  fur-trading stage, the New England frontier towns were rather like mark  colonies, military-agricultural outposts against the Indian enemy.    The story of the border warfare between Canada and the frontier towns  furnishes ample material for studying frontier life and institutions;  but I shall not attempt to deal with the narrative of the wars. The  palisaded meeting-house square, the fortified isolated garrison houses,  the massacres and captivities are familiar features of New England's  history. The Indian was a very real influence upon the mind and morals  as well as upon the institutions of frontier New England. The occasional  instances of Puritans returning from captivity to visit the frontier  towns, Catholic in religion, painted and garbed as Indians and speaking  the Indian tongue,[44:3] and the half-breed children of captive Puritan  mothers, tell a sensational part of the story; but in the normal, as  well as in such exceptional relations of the frontier townsmen to the  Indians, there are clear evidences of the transforming influence of the  Indian frontier upon the Puritan type of English colonist.    In 1703-4, for example, the General Court of Massachusetts ordered five  hundred pairs of snowshoes and an equal number of moccasins for use in  specified counties \"lying Frontier next to the Wilderness.\"[45:1]  Connecticut in 1704 after referring to her frontier towns and garrisons  ordered that \"said company of English and Indians shall, from time to  time at the discretion of their chief co[=m]ander, range the woods to  indevour the discovery of an approaching enemy, and in especiall manner  from Westfield to Ousatunnuck.[45:2] . . .
