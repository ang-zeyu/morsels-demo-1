From three tall  flagstaffs on shore there floated gracefully as many American flags as  though to wish us well on our long journey out to civilization.    That night on board was simply pandemonium. Hundreds of people had no  beds, and were obliged to sit or walk about, many sitting in corners on  the floor, or on piles of luggage or lying under or upon the tables.  Every seat and berth were taken. Many of the staterooms below were  filled from floor to ceiling with flour in sacks for Nome, as well as  every foot of space in passage-ways or pantries. Many men were so  disorderly from drink that they kept constantly swearing and quarreling,  and one man, in a brawl, was almost toppled into the sea. To make  things worse, the stench from the pens of the animals on deck became  almost unbearable, and the wind came up, making the water rough.    There was no sleep for us that night. We longed to reach Nome that we  might be rid of some of these objectionable things, and hoped for an  improvement afterward.    From St. Michael to Nome, the distance is about one hundred and  twenty-five miles, and the latter place was reached about eight A. M. A  little before daylight we had been startled by a series of four sudden  shocks or jars, the first being accompanied by a very distinct creaking  of timbers of the ship, so that some of us rose and dressed; but the  ship had apparently sustained no injury, and we proceeded on our way.  Whether we had struck a rock, or only a sand-bar, we never knew, for the  ship's men laughed and evaded our questions; but the passengers believed  that the boat had touched a reef or rock, hidden, perhaps, beneath the  surface of the sea.    By daylight the animals had been removed to a barge, and soon after  breakfast the Nome passengers were taken ashore in like manner, for the  surf was so heavy on the beach, and there being no docks or wharves, it  was impossible for a large steamer to get nearer.    Away in the distance to the north lay the famous new gold camp of  Nome. Stretched for miles along the beach could be seen the little white  tents of the beach miners, back of which lay the town proper, and still  back, the rolling hills now partly covered with snow. Not a tree or  shrub could be seen, though we strained our eyes through a strong glass  in an effort to find them. A few wooden buildings larger than the rest  were pointed out as the Alaska Commercial Company's warehouses and  offices, near where the loaded barges were tossed by the huge breakers  toward the beach.    [Illustration: ESKIMOS.]    Passengers now went ashore to visit the camps, but to my great  disappointment I was not allowed to do so on account of the tremendous  surf. When, after watching others, seeing their little boats tossed like  cockle shells upon the sands, and hearing how thoroughly drenched with  salt water many of the people were while landing, I gave it up, and  remained on board.    For five days we lay anchored outside, while stevedores loaded supplies  from the \"Bertha\" on barges towed ashore by the side-wheeler \"Sadie.\"  For hours the wind would blow and the breakers and surf run so high that  nothing could be done; then at sundown, perhaps, the wind would die  away, and men were put to work unloading again. The calls of those  lifting and tugging, the rattle of pulleys and chains, never were  stilled night or day if the water was passably smooth, and we learned to  sleep soundly amid all the confusion.    Next morning the steamer \"Cleveland\" cast anchor near the \"Bertha.\"  Presently we saw a small boat lowered over the side and two women were  handed down into it, four men following and seating themselves at the  oars. The ship on which the women had first sailed had been wrecked on  St. George's Island; from there they were rescued by the revenue cutter  \"Bear,\" transferred to the \"Cleveland,\" and were now going ashore at  Nome, their destination. As they passed us we noticed that they sat  upright in the middle of the lifeboat, the hoods of their cloaks drawn  quite over their heads. We were told that one of these women had come to  meet her lover and be married, and we felt like cheering such heroism.    Next day the bodies of several men were picked up on the beach near  town. They had started for Cape Prince of Wales in a small boat and been  overtaken by disaster. Many were dying of fever on shore, and nurses,  doctors and drugs were in great demand.    Many tales of interest now reached our ears, but not many can here be  given.    One of the first American children to open his eyes to the light of day  in this bleak and barren place--Nome City--was Little Willie S. His  parents lived in a poor board shack or house which his father had built  just back of the golden beach sands. Here the surf, all foam-tipped,  spread itself at the rising and falling of the tides, and here the  miners toiled day after day washing out the precious gold.    It was here that Willie's papa, soon after the baby came, sickened and  died. He had worked too long in the wind and rain, and they laid him  under the tundra at the foot of the hill.    For a time the baby grew. The mother and child were now dependent upon  the community for support, but the burly and generous miners did not  allow them to want. Willie was a great pet in the mining camp; the men  being delighted with a peep of his tiny, round face and pink fingers.    The little child could have easily had his weight in gold dust, or  anything else, had he wanted it. Big, shining nuggets had already been  given him to cut his teeth upon when the time came, but that time never  came.    Willie died one day in his mother's arms, while her hot tears fell like  rain upon his face.    Then they laid him to sleep beside his papa under the tundra, where the  shining wheat-gold clung to the moss roots and sparkled as brightly as  the frost and snow which soon covered everything.    When spring came Willie's mamma found the baby's tiny grave, and put  wild flowers and grasses upon it, and there they nodded their pretty  heads above the spot where Willie and his papa quietly sleep.    Passengers for San Francisco were now coming on board with their  luggage. Several men were brought on board on spring beds, being ill  with no contagious disease. A box containing the body of a man, who had  shot himself the day before, was placed upon the hurricane deck, lashed  down, and covered with tarpaulins. Strong boxes of gold bullion, with  long, stout ropes and boards attached in case of accident, were stowed  away in as safe a place as could be found. Copies of the first issue of  the \"Nome News\" were bought at fifty cents a copy; size, four pages  about a foot square. Beach sand and pebbles, were handed about in many  funny receptacles,--pickle jars, tin cans, flour sacks,--any old thing  would do if only we had the pleasure of seeing the golden sand.    One night about three o'clock the barge brought the last passengers and  freight. The water was smooth, the moon shone brightly, there was no  wind, and the captain and his mate gave their orders in quick, stern  tones. They were in haste to leave. They had lingered here too long  already. All were soon hustled on board; the \"Sadie\" and her barges  moved away; we took a last, long look at Nome as she stretched herself  on the golden sands of the beach under her electric lights; the \"Bertha\"  whistled, stuck her nose into the rollers and steamed away.    A more majestic old body of water than Behring Sea would be hard to  find; and we remember it with thanksgiving, for we had no storms or  rough weather during the eight hundred and fifty miles to Unalaska.    Right glad was I that we were fortunate in having a pleasant little  party of eight or ten persons, and our evenings were spent in visiting,  spinning yarns, and singing songs, while some hours each day were passed  on the hurricane deck. Here we became familiar with the sea phrases  commonly used, and watched the old salts \"bracing the mast arms,\"  \"hoisting the jibs,\" or \"tacking,\" and could tell when we had a \"cross  sea,\" a \"beam sea,\" or a \"sou' wester.\" As we neared Unalaska on the  Aleutian Islands, the sea became rough, and we had more wind, but we  joyfully sighted high hills or rocks to the east, and bade good-bye to  old Behring. For three and a half days he had behaved well, and never  will we quietly hear him maligned.    Unalaska, sweet isle of the sea! How beautiful she looked to our eyes  which had only seen water for days! Its bold and rocky cliffs, its  towering peaks snow capped; its sequestered and winding valleys, and  bright, sparkling waterfalls; its hillsides in all the artistic shades  of red, brown, yellow, green, purple, black and white; its water in all  the tints of blue and azure, reflecting sky that looked       \"As though an angel in his upward flight,      Had left his mantle floating in mid-air.\"    All, all, greeted the eye of the worn voyager most restfully.    Clusters of quaint red buildings were soon seen nestling under the  mountain--that was Dutch Harbor, and a mile farther on we arrived at the  dock at Unalaska. We would be here twenty-four hours taking on fresh  water, coal, and food, they told us, and we all ran out like sheep from  a pen, or school children at intermission. We drank fresh water from the  spring under the green hillside; we bought apples and oranges at the  store, and furs of the furrier; we rowed in a skiff and scampered over  the hills to Dutch Harbor; we watched jelly-fish and pink star-fish in  the water; we saw white reindeer apparently as tame as cows browsing on  the slopes; we visited an old Greek church, and were kept from the very  holiest place where only men were allowed to go, retaliating when we  came to the cash box at the door--we dropped nothing in; we climbed the  highest mountain near by, and staked imaginary gold claims after  drinking in the beauties of the views which encompassed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],[0,"The Book of Nature Myths (#9)"],[1,"dusk came on, and the stars twinkling softly  in the summer sky.    It is no wonder that Argus closed one eye and then the other. Every one  of his hundred eyes was fast asleep, and Mercury went away to the king  of the gods with the cream-white cow.    [Illustration]    Juno had so often played tricks on the king that he was happy because he  had played this one on her, but Juno was angry, and she said to Argus,  \"You are a strange watchman. You have a hundred eyes, and you could not  keep even one of them from falling asleep. My peacock is wiser than you,  for he knows when any one is looking at him. I will put every one of  your eyes in the tail of the peacock.\" And to-day, whoever looks at the  peacock can count in his tail the hundred eyes that once belonged to  Argus.          THE STORY OF THE BEES AND THE FLIES.      There were once two tribes of little people who lived near together.  They were not at all alike, for one of the tribes looked for food and  carried it away to put it up safely for winter, while the other played  and sang and danced all day long.    \"Come and play with us,\" said the lazy people, but the busy workers  answered, \"No, come and work with us. Winter will soon be here. Snow and  ice will be everywhere, and if we do not put up food now we shall have  none for the cold, stormy days.\"    So the busy people brought honey from the flowers, but the lazy people  kept on playing. They laughed together and whispered to one another,  \"See those busy workers! They will have food for two tribes, and they  will give us some. Let us go and dance.\"    While the summer lasted, one tribe worked and the other played. When  winter came, the busy workers were sorry for their friends and said,  \"Let us give them some of our honey.\" So the people who played had as  much food as if they, too, had brought honey from the flowers.    Another summer was coming, and the workers said, \"If we should make our  home near the lilies that give us honey, it would be easier to get our  food.\" So the workers flew away, but the lazy people played and danced  as they had done before while their friends were near, for they thought,  \"Oh, they will come back and bring us some honey.\"    By and by the cold came, but the lazy people had nothing to eat, and the  workers did not come with food. The manito had said to them, \"Dear  little workers, you shall no longer walk from flower to flower. I will  give you wings, and you shall be bees. Whenever men hear a gentle  humming, they will say, 'Those are the busy bees, and their wings were  given them because they were wise and good.'\"    [Illustration]    To the other tribe the manito said, \"You shall be flies, and you, too,  shall have wings; but while the workers fly from flower to flower and  eat the yellow honey, you shall have for your food only what has been  thrown away. When men hear your buzzing, they will say, 'It is good that  the flies have wings, because we can drive them away from us the more  quickly.'\"          THE STORY OF THE FIRST MOLES.      A rich man and a poor man once owned a field together. The rich man  owned the northern half, and the poor man owned the southern half. Each  man sowed his ground with seed. The warm days came, the gentle rain  fell, and the seed in the poor man's half of the field sprang up and put  forth leaves. The seed in the rich man's half all died in the ground.    The rich man was selfish and wicked. He said, \"The southern half of the  field is mine,\" but the poor man replied, \"No, the southern half is  mine, for that is where I sowed my seed.\"    The rich man had a son who was as wicked as himself. This boy whispered,  \"Father, tell him to come in the morning. I know how we can keep the  land.\" So the rich man said, \"Come in the morning, and we shall soon see  whose land this is.\"    At night the rich man and his son pulled up some bushes that grew beside  the field, and the son hid in the hole where their roots had been.    Morning came, and many people went to the field with the rich man. The  poor man was sorrowful, for he feared that he would lose his ground.    \"Now we shall see,\" said the rich man boastfully, and he called aloud,  \"Whose ground is this?\"    \"This is the ground of the rich man,\" answered a voice from the hole.    \"How shall I ever get food for my children!\" cried the poor man.    Then another voice was heard. It was that of the spirit of the fields,  and it said, \"The southern half of the field is the poor man's, and the  northern half shall be his too.\"    The rich man would have run away, but the voice called, \"Wait. Look  where the bushes once stood. The boy in the hole and his wicked father  shall hide in the darkness as long as they live, and never again shall  they see the light of the sun.\"    This is the story of the first moles, and this is why the mole never  comes to the light of day.          THE STORY OF THE FIRST ANTS.      \"This jar is full of smoked flesh,\" said one voice.    \"This has fish, this is full of honey, and that one is almost running  over with oil,\" said another voice. \"We shall have all that we need to  eat for many days to come.\"    These are the words that a villager coming home from his work heard his  mother and his sister say.    \"They have often played tricks on me,\" he said to himself, \"and now I  will play one on them.\" So he went into the house and said, \"Mother, I  have found that I have a wonderful sense of smell, and by its help I can  find whatever is hidden away.\"    \"That is a marvelous story,\" cried the sister.    \"If you can tell me what is in these jars,\" said his mother, \"I shall  think you are really a magician. What is it now?\"    \"This is flesh, this fish, this honey, and this jar is full of oil,\"  said the man.    \"I never heard of such a marvel in all my life,\" cried the mother; and  in the morning she called her friends and said, \"Only think what a  wonderful sense of smell my son has! He told me what was in these jars  when they were closed.\"    It was not long before the people all through the country heard of the  wonderful man, and one day word came that the king wished to see him at  once.    The man was afraid, for he did not know what would happen to him, and he  was still more afraid when the king said, \"A pearl is lost that I had in  my hand last night. They say you can find things that are lost. Find my  pearl, or your head will he lost.\"    The poor man went out into the forest. \"Oh, how I wish I had not tried  to play tricks,\" he wailed. \"Then this sharp sorrow, this dire trouble,  would not have come upon me.\"    \"Please, please do not tell the king,\" said two voices in the shadow of  the trees.    \"Who are you?\" asked the man.    \"Oh, you must know us well,\" said a man coming out into the light. \"My  name is Sharp, and that man behind the tree is named Dire, but please do  not tell the king. We will give you the pearl; here it is. You called  our names, and we saw that you knew us. Oh, I wish I had not been a  thief!\"    The man gave the pearl to the king, and went home wishing that no one  would ever talk to him again of his sense of smell.    In three days word came from the queen that he must come to her at once.  She thought his power was only a trick, and to catch him she had put a  cat into a bag and the bag into a box.    When the man came, she asked sharply, \"What is in this box? Tell me the  truth, or off will go your head.\"    [Illustration: A WONDERFUL SENSE OF SMELL]    \"What shall I do?\" thought the man, \"Dire death is upon me.\" He did not  remember that he was before the queen, and he repeated half aloud an old  saying, \"The bagged cat soon dies.\"    \"What is that?\" cried the queen.    \"The bagged cat soon dies,\" repeated the man in great terror.    \"You are a marvelous man,\" said the queen. \"There is really a bag in the  box and a cat in the bag, but no one besides myself knew it.\"    \"He is not a man; he is a god,\" cried the people, \"and he must be in the  sky and live among the gods;\" so they threw him up to the sky. His hand  was full of earth, and when the earth fell back, it was no longer earth,  but a handful of ants. Ants have a wonderful sense of smell, and it is  because they fell from the hand of this man who was thrown up into the  sky to live among the gods.          THE FACE OF THE MANITO.      Many years ago the manito of the Indians lived in the sun. Every morning  the wise men of the tribe went to the top of a mountain, and as the sun  rose in the east, they sang, \"We praise thee, O sun! From thee come fire  and light. Be good to us, be good to us.\"    After the warm days of the summer had come, the sun was so bright that  the Indians said to their wise men, \"When you go to the mountain top,  ask the manito to show us his face in a softer, gentler light.\"    Then the wise men went to the mountain top, and this is what they said:  \"O great manito, we are but children before you, and we have no power to  bear the brightness of your face. Look down upon us here on the earth  with a gentler, softer light, that we may ever gaze upon you and show  you all love and all honor.\"    The bright sun moved slowly toward the south. The people were afraid  that the manito was angry with them, but when the moon rose they were  no longer sad, for from the moon the loving face of the manito was  looking down upon them.    Night after night the people gazed at the gentle face, but at last a  night came when the moon was not seen in the sky. The wise men went  sorrowfully to the mountain top. \"O manito,\" they said, \"we are never  happy when we cannot gaze into your face. Will you not show it to your  children?\"    The moon did not rise, and the people were sad, but when morning came,  there was the loving face of the manito showing clearly in the rocks at  the top of the mountain.    Again they were happy, but when dark clouds hid the gentle face, the  wise men went to the foot of the mountain and called sadly, \"O manito,"]]]
