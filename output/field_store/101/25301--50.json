He says he has  shaved it, his wife declares he has only cut it off. He flings her  into a deep pool, and calls to her to say \"shaved.\" Utterance is  impossible to her, but \"she lifts one hand above the water and by  means of two fingers makes signs to show that it was cut.\"[48] The  story has even settled into a proverb. Of a contradictory woman the  Russian peasants affirm that, \"If you say 'shaved' she'll say 'cut.'\"    In the same way another story shows us in Russian garb our old friend  the widower who, when looking for his drowned wife--a woman of a very  antagonistic disposition--went up the river instead of down, saying to  his astonished companions, \"She always did everything contrary-wise,  so now, no doubt, she's gone against the stream.\"[49] A common story  again is that of the husband who, having confided a secret to his wife  which he justly fears she will reveal, throws discredit on her  evidence about things in general by making her believe various absurd  stories which she hastens to repeat.[49] The final paragraph of one of  the variants of this time-honored jest is quaint, concluding as it  does, by way of sting, with a highly popular Russian saw. The wife has  gone to the seigneur of the village and accused her husband of having  found a treasure and kept it for his own use. The charge is true, but  the wife is induced to talk such nonsense, and the husband complains  so bitterly of her, that \"the seigneur pitied the moujik for being so  unfortunate, so he set him at liberty; and he had him divorced from  his wife and married to another, a young and good-looking one. Then  the moujik immediately dug up his treasure and began living in the  best manner possible.\" Sure enough the proverb doesn't say without  reason: \"Women have long hair and short wits.\"[50]    There is another story of this class which is worthy of being  mentioned, as it illustrates a custom in which the Russians differ  from some other peoples.    A certain man had married a wife who was so capricious that there was  no living with her. After trying all sorts of devices her dejected  husband at last asked her how she had been brought up, and learnt that  she had received an education almost entirely German and French, with  scarcely any Russian in it; she had not even been wrapped in  swaddling-clothes when a baby, nor swung in a _liulka_.[51] Thereupon  her husband determined to remedy the short-comings of her early  education, and \"whenever she showed herself capricious, or took to  squalling, he immediately had her swaddled and placed in a _liulka_,  and began swinging her to and fro.\" By the end of a half year she  became \"quite silky\"--all her caprices had been swung out of her.    But instead of giving mere extracts from any more of the numerous  stories to which the fruitful subject of woman's caprice has given  rise, we will quote a couple of such tales at length. The first is the  Russian variant of a story which has a long family tree, with  ramifications extending over a great part of the world. Dr. Benfey has  devoted to it no less than sixteen pages of his introduction to the  Panchatantra,[52] tracing it from its original Indian home, and its  subsequent abode in Persia, into almost every European land.        THE BAD WIFE.[53]      A bad wife lived on the worst of terms with her husband, and    never paid any attention to what he said. If her husband told    her to get up early, she would lie in bed three days at a stretch;    if he wanted her to go to sleep, she couldn't think of sleeping.    When her husband asked her to make pancakes, she would say:    \"You thief, you don't deserve a pancake!\"      If he said:      \"Don't make any pancakes, wife, if I don't deserve them,\"    she would cook a two-gallon pot full, and say,      \"Eat away, you thief, till they're all gone!\"      \"Now then, wife,\" perhaps he would say, \"I feel quite sorry    for you; don't go toiling and moiling, and don't go out to the    hay cutting.\"      \"No, no, you thief!\" she would reply, \"I shall go, and do    you follow after me!\"      One day, after having had his trouble and bother with her    he went into the forest to look for berries and distract his grief,    and he came to where there was a currant bush, and in the middle    of that bush he saw a bottomless pit. He looked at it for    some time and considered, \"Why should I live in torment with    a bad wife? can't I put her into that pit? can't I teach her a    good lesson?\"      So when he came home, he said:      \"Wife, don't go into the woods for berries.\"      \"Yes, you bugbear, I shall go!\"      \"I've found a currant bush; don't pick it.\"      \"Yes I will; I shall go and pick it clean; but I won't give    you a single currant!\"      The husband went out, his wife with him. He came to the    currant bush, and his wife jumped into it, crying out at the top    her voice:      \"Don't you come into the bush, you thief, or I'll kill you!\"      And so she got into the middle of the bush, and went flop    into the bottomless pit.      The husband returned home joyfully, and remained there    three days; on the fourth day he went to see how things were    going on. Taking a long cord, he let it down into the pit, and    out from thence he pulled a little demon. Frightened out of his    wits, he was going to throw the imp back again into the pit,    but it shrieked aloud, and earnestly entreated him, saying:      \"Don't send me back again, O peasant! let me go out into    the world! A bad wife has come, and absolutely devoured us    all, pinching us, and biting us--we're utterly worn out with it.    I'll do you a good turn, if you will.\"      So the peasant let him go free--at large in Holy Russia.    Then the imp said:      \"Now then, peasant, come along with me to the town of    Vologda. I'll take to tormenting people, and you shall cure    them.\"      Well, the imp went to where there were merchant's wives    and merchant's daughters; and when they were possessed by    him, they fell ill and went crazy. Then the peasant would go to    a house where there was illness of this kind, and, as soon as he    entered, out would go the enemy; then there would be blessing    in the house, and everyone would suppose that the peasant was    a doctor indeed, and would give him money, and treat him to    pies. And so the peasant gained an incalculable sum of money.    At last the demon said:      \"You've plenty now, peasant; arn't you content? I'm going    now to enter into the Boyar's daughter. Mind you don't go    curing her. If you do, I shall eat you.\"      The Boyar's daughter fell ill, and went so crazy that she    wanted to eat people. The Boyar ordered his people to find out    the peasant--(that is to say) to look for such and such a physician.    The peasant came, entered the house, and told Boyar to    make all the townspeople, and the carriages with coachmen, stand    in the street outside. Moreover, he gave orders that all the    coachmen should crack their whips and cry at the top of their    voices: \"The Bad Wife has come! the Bad Wife has come!\"    and then he went into the inner room. As soon as he entered    it, the demon rushed at him crying, \"What do you mean, Russian?    what have you come here for? I'll eat you!\"      \"What do _you_ mean?\" said the peasant, \"why I didn't    come here to turn you out. I came, out of pity to you, to say    that the Bad Wife has come here.\"      The Demon rushed to the window, stared with all his eyes,    and heard everyone shouting at the top of his voice the words,    \"The Bad Wife!\"      \"Peasant,\" cries the Demon, \"wherever can I take refuge?\"      \"Run back into the pit. She won't go there any more.\"      The Demon went back to the pit--and to the Bad Wife too.      In return for his services, the Boyar conferred a rich guerdon    on the peasant, giving him his daughter to wife, and presenting    him with half his property.      But the Bad Wife sits to this day in the pit--in Tartarus.[54]    Our final illustration of the Skazkas which satirize women is the  story of the _Golovikha_. It is all the more valuable, inasmuch as it  is one of the few folk-tales which throw any light on the working of  Russian communal institutions. The word _Golovikha_ means, in its  strict sense, the wife of a _Golova_, or elected chief [_Golova_ =  head] of a _Volost_, or association of village communities; but here  it is used for a \"female _Golova_,\" a species of \"mayoress.\"        THE GOLOVIKHA.[55]      A certain woman was very bumptious. Her husband came    from a village council one day, and she asked him:      \"What have you been deciding over there?\"      \"What have we been deciding? why choosing a Golova.\"      \"Whom have you chosen?\"      \"No one as yet.\"      \"Choose me,\" says the woman.      So as soon as her husband went back to the council (she was    a bad sort; he wanted to give her a lesson) he told the elders    what she had said. They immediately chose her as Golova.      Well the woman got along, settled all questions, took bribes,    and drank spirits at the peasant's expense. But the time came    to collect the poll-tax. The Golova couldn't do it, wasn't able    to collect it in time. There came a Cossack, and asked for the    Golova; but the woman had hidden herself. As soon as she    learnt that the Cossack had come, off she ran home.      \"Where, oh where can I hide myself?\" she cries to her    husband. \"Husband dear! tie me up in a bag, and put me out    there where the corn-sacks are.\"      Now there were five sacks of seed-corn outside, so her husband    tied up the Golova, and set her in the midst of them. Up    came the Cossack and said:      \"Ho! so the Golova's in hiding.\"      Then he took to slashing at the sacks one after another with    his whip, and the woman to howling at the pitch of her voice:      \"Oh, my father! I won't be a Golova, I won't be a Golova.\"      At last the Cossack left off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#9)"],[1,"espouses the cause of the Greeks and exerts all her influence on their  behalf. The Areopagus, a court of justice where religious causes and  murders were tried, was believed to have been instituted by her, and when  both sides happened to have an equal number of votes she gave the  casting-vote in favour of the accused. She was the patroness of learning,  science, and art, more particularly where these contributed directly  towards the welfare of nations. She presided over all inventions connected  with agriculture, invented the plough, and taught mankind how to use oxen  for farming purposes. She also instructed mankind in the use of numbers,  trumpets, chariots, &c., and presided over the building of the Argo,[20]  thereby encouraging the useful art of navigation. She also taught the  Greeks how to build the wooden horse by means of which the destruction of  Troy was effected.    The safety of cities depended on her care, for which reason her temples  were generally built on the citadels, and she was supposed to watch over  the defence of the walls, fortifications, harbours, &c. A divinity who so  faithfully guarded the best interests of the state, by not only protecting  it from the attacks of enemies, but also by developing its chief resources  of wealth and prosperity, was worthily chosen as the presiding deity of the  state, and in this character as an essentially political goddess she was  called Athene-Polias.    The fact of Athene having been born clad in armour, which merely signified  that her virtue and purity were unassailable, has given rise to the  erroneous supposition that she was the presiding goddess of war; but a  deeper {45} study of her character in all its bearings proves that, in  contradistinction to her brother Ares, the god of war, who loved strife for  its own sake, she only takes up arms to protect the innocent and deserving  against tyrannical oppression. It is true that in the Iliad we frequently  see her on the battlefield fighting valiantly, and protecting her favourite  heroes; but this is always at the command of Zeus, who even supplies her  with arms for the purpose, as it is supposed that she possessed none of her  own. A marked feature in the representations of this deity is the aegis,  that wonderful shield given to her by her father as a further means of  defence, which, when in danger, she swung so swiftly round and round that  it kept at a distance all antagonistic influences; hence her name Pallas,  from _pallo_, I swing. In the centre of this shield, which was covered with  dragon's scales, bordered with serpents, and which she sometimes wore as a  breastplate, was the awe-inspiring head of the Medusa, which had the effect  of turning to stone all beholders.    In addition to the many functions which she exercised in connection with  the state, Athene presided over the two chief departments of feminine  industry, spinning and weaving. In the latter art she herself displayed  unrivalled ability and exquisite taste. She wove her own robe and that of  Hera, which last she is said to have embroidered very richly; she also gave  Jason a cloak wrought by herself, when he set forth in quest of the Golden  Fleece. Being on one occasion challenged to a contest in this  accomplishment by a mortal maiden named Arachne, whom she had instructed in  the art of weaving, she accepted the challenge and was completely  vanquished by her pupil. Angry at her defeat, she struck the unfortunate  maiden on the forehead with the shuttle which she held in her hand; and  Arachne, being of a sensitive nature, was so hurt by this indignity that  she hung herself in despair, and was changed by Athene into a spider. This  goddess is said to have invented the flute,[21] upon {46} which she played  with considerable talent, until one day, being laughed at by the assembled  gods and goddesses for the contortions which her countenance assumed during  these musical efforts, she hastily ran to a fountain in order to convince  herself whether she deserved their ridicule. Finding to her intense disgust  that such was indeed the fact, she threw the flute away, and never raised  it to her lips again.    [Illustration]    Athene is usually represented fully draped; she has a serious and  thoughtful aspect, as though replete with earnestness and wisdom; the  beautiful oval contour of her countenance is adorned by the luxuriance of  her wealth of hair, which is drawn back from the temples and hangs down in  careless grace; she looks the embodiment of strength, grandeur, and  majesty; whilst her broad shoulders and small hips give her a slightly  masculine appearance.    When represented as the war-goddess she appears clad in armour, with a  helmet on her head, from which waves a large plume; she carries the aegis on  her arm, and in her hand a golden staff, which possessed the property of  endowing her chosen favourites with youth and dignity.    Athene was universally worshipped throughout Greece, but was regarded with  special veneration by the Athenians, she being the guardian deity of  Athens. Her most celebrated temple was the Parthenon, which stood on the  {47} Acropolis at Athens, and contained her world-renowned statue by  Phidias, which ranks second only to that of Zeus by the same great artist.  This colossal statue was 39 feet high, and was composed of ivory and gold;  its majestic beauty formed the chief attraction of the temple. It  represented her standing erect, bearing her spear and shield; in her hand  she held an image of Nike, and at her feet there lay a serpent.    The tree sacred to her was the olive, which she herself produced in a  contest with Poseidon. The olive-tree thus called into existence was  preserved in the temple of Erectheus, on the Acropolis, and is said to have  possessed such marvellous vitality, that when the Persians burned it after  sacking the town it immediately burst forth into new shoots.    The principal festival held in honour of this divinity was the Panathenaea.    The owl, cock, and serpent were the animals sacred to her, and her  sacrifices were rams, bulls, and cows.    [Illustration]    MINERVA.    The Minerva of the Romans was identified with the Pallas-Athene of the  Greeks. Like her she presides over learning and all useful arts, and is the  patroness of the feminine accomplishments of sewing, spinning, weaving, &c.  Schools were under her especial care, and schoolboys, therefore, had  holidays during her festivals (the Greater Quinquatria), when they always  brought a gift to their master, called the Minerval.    It is worthy of notice that the only three divinities {48} worshipped in  the Capitol were Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and in their joint honour the  Ludi Maximi or great games were held.    THEMIS.    Themis, who has already been alluded to as the wife of Zeus, was the  daughter of Cronus and Rhea, and personified those divine laws of justice  and order by means of which the well-being and morality of communities are  regulated. She presided over the assemblies of the people and the laws of  hospitality. To her was intrusted the office of convoking the assembly of  the gods, and she was also mistress of ritual and ceremony. On account of  her great wisdom Zeus himself frequently sought her counsel and acted upon  her advice. Themis was a prophetic divinity, and had an oracle near the  river Cephissus in Boeotia.    She is usually represented as being in the full maturity of womanhood, of  fair aspect, and wearing a flowing garment, which drapes her noble,  majestic form; in her right hand she holds the sword of justice, and in her  left the scales, which indicate the impartiality with which every cause is  carefully weighed by her, her eyes being bandaged so that the personality  of the individual should carry no weight with respect to the verdict.    This divinity is sometimes identified with Tyche, sometimes with Ananke.    Themis, like so many other Greek divinities, takes the place of a more  ancient deity of the same name who was a daughter of Uranus and Gaea. This  elder Themis inherited from her mother the gift of prophecy, and when she  became merged into her younger representative she transmitted to her this  prophetic power.    HESTIA (Vesta).    Hestia was the daughter of Cronus and Rhea. She was the goddess of Fire in  its first application to the wants of mankind, hence she was essentially  the presiding deity {49} of the domestic hearth and the guardian spirit of  man, and it was her pure and benign influence which was supposed to protect  the sanctity of domestic life.    Now in these early ages the hearth was regarded as the most important and  most sacred portion of the dwelling, probably because the protection of the  fire was an important consideration, for if once permitted to become  extinct, re-ignition was attended with extreme difficulty. In fact, the  hearth was held so sacred that it constituted the sanctum of the family,  for which reason it was always erected in the centre of every house. It was  a few feet in height and was built of stone; the fire was placed on the top  of it, and served the double purpose of preparing the daily meals, and  consuming the family sacrifices. Round this domestic hearth or altar were  gathered the various members of the family, the head of the house occupying  the place of honour nearest the hearth. Here prayers were said and  sacrifices offered, and here also every kind and loving feeling was  fostered, which even extended to the hunted and guilty stranger, who, if he  once succeeded in touching this sacred altar, was safe from pursuit and  punishment, and was henceforth placed under the protection of the family.  Any crime committed within the sacred precincts of the domestic hearth was  invariably visited by death.    [Illustration]    In Grecian cities there was a common hall, called the Prytaneum, in which  the members of the government had their meals at the expense of"]]]
