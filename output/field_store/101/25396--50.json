This has been of great service in identifying the various ruins  and assigning them dates, at least approximately. As is to be expected,  there is a notable difference in the specimens of different periods.  While on some bricks bearing the name of a king who lived about 3000  B.C. the inscription is uncouth and scarcely legible, and even their  shape is rude and the material very inferior, those of the later  Babylonian period (600 B.C.) are handsome and neatly made. As to the  quality, all explorers agree in saying it is fully equal to that of the  best modern English bricks. The excellence of these bricks for building  purposes is a fact so well known that for now two thousand years--ever  since the destruction of Babylon--its walls, temples and palaces have  been used as quarries for the construction of cities and villages. The  little town of HILLAH, situated nearest to the site of the ancient  capital, is built almost entirely with bricks from one single mound,  that of KASR--once the gorgeous and far-famed palace of Nebuchadnezzar,  whose name and titles thus grace the walls of the most lowly Arab and  Turkish dwellings. All the other mounds are similarly used, and so far  is the valuable mine from being exhausted, that it furnishes forth, to  this day, a brisk and flourishing trade. While a party of workmen is  continually employed in digging for the available bricks, another is  busy conveying them to Hillah; there they are shipped on the Euphrates  and carried to any place where building materials are in demand, often  even loaded on donkeys at this or that landing-place and sent miles away  inland; some are taken as far as Baghdad, where they have been used for  ages. The same thing is done wherever there are mounds and ruins. Both  Layard and his successors had to allow their Arab workmen to build their  own temporary houses out of ancient bricks, only watching them narrowly,  lest they should break some valuable relic in the process or use some of  the handsomest and best-preserved specimens.    [Illustration: 8.--VIEW OF NEBBI YUNUS]    4. No construction of bricks, either crude or kiln-dried, could have  sufficient solidity without the help of some kind of cement, to make  them adhere firmly together. This also the lowlands of Chaldea and  Babylonia yield in sufficient quantity and of various qualities. While  in the early structures a kind of sticky red clay or loam is used, mixed  with chopped straw, bitumen or pitch is substituted at a later period,  which substance, being applied hot, adheres so firmly to the bricks,  that pieces of these are broken off when an attempt is made to procure a  fragment of the cement. This valuable article was brought down by water  from IS on the Euphrates (now called HIT), where abundant springs of  bitumen are to this day in activity. Calcareous earth--i.e., earth  strongly mixed with lime--being very plentiful to the west of the lower  Euphrates, towards the Arabian frontier, the Babylonians of the latest  times learned to make of it a white mortar which, for lightness and  strength, has never been surpassed.    [Illustration: 9.--BUILDING IN BAKED BRICK (MODERN). (Perrot and  Chipiez.)]    5. All the essential materials for plain but durable constructions being  thus procurable on the spot or in the immediate neighborhood, the next  important point was the selection of proper sites for raising these  constructions, which were to serve purposes of defence as well as of  worship and royal majesty. A rocky eminence, inaccessible on one or  several sides, or at least a hill, a knoll somewhat elevated above the  surrounding plain, have usually been chosen wherever such existed. But  this was not the case in Chaldea. There, as far as eye can see, not the  slightest undulation breaks the dead flatness of the land. Yet there,  more than anywhere else, an elevated position was desirable, if only as  a protection from the unhealthy exhalations of a vast tract of swamps,  and from the intolerable nuisance of swarms of aggressive and venomous  insects, which infest the entire river region during the long summer  season. Safety from the attacks of the numerous roaming tribes which  ranged the country in every direction before it was definitely settled  and organized, was also not among the last considerations. So, what  nature had refused, the cunning and labor of man had to supply.  Artificial hills or platforms were constructed, of enormous size and  great height--from thirty to fifty, even sixty feet, and on their flat  summits the buildings were raised. These platforms sometimes supported  only one palace, sometimes, as in the case of the immense mounds of  Koyunjik and Nimrud in Assyria, their surface had room for several,  built by successive kings. Of course such huge piles could not be  entirely executed in solid masonry, even of crude bricks. These were  generally mixed with earth and rubbish of all kinds, in more or less  regular, alternate layers, the bricks being laid in clay. But the  outward facing was in all cases of baked brick. The platform of the  principal mound which marks the place of ancient UR, (now called  MUGHEIR),[H] is faced with a wall ten feet thick, of red kiln-dried  bricks, cemented with bitumen. In Assyria, where stone was not scarce,  the sides of the platform were even more frequently \"protected by  massive stone-masonry, carried perpendicularly from the natural ground  to a height somewhat exceeding that of the platform, and either made  plain at the top, or else crowned into stone battlements cut into  gradines.\"[I]    [Illustration: 10.--MOUND OF NIMRUD. (Hommel.)]    6. Some mounds are considerably higher than the others and of a peculiar  shape, almost like a pyramid, that is, ending in a point from which it  slopes down rapidly on all sides. Such is the pyramidal mound of Nimrud,  which Layard describes as being so striking and picturesque an object as  you approach the ruins from any point of the plain.[J] Such also is the  still more picturesque mound of BORSIP (now BIRS NIMRUD) near Babylon,  the largest of this kind.[K] These mounds are the remains of peculiar  constructions, called ZIGGURATS, composed of several platforms piled one  on the other, each square in shape and somewhat smaller than the  preceding one; the topmost platform supported a temple or sanctuary,  which by these means was raised far above the dwellings of men, a  constant reminder not less eloquent than the exhortation in some of our  religious services: \"Lift up your hearts!\" Of these heavenward pointing  towers, which were also used as observatories by the Chaldeans, great  lovers of the starry heavens, that of Borsip, once composed of seven  stages, is the loftiest; it measures over 150 feet in perpendicular  height.    [Illustration: 11.--MOUND OF MUGHEIR (ANCIENT UR).]    7. It is evident that these artificial hills could have been erected  only at an incredible cost of labor. The careful measurements which have  been taken of several of the principal mounds have enabled explorers to  make an accurate calculation of the exact amount of labor employed on  each. The result is startling, even though one is prepared for something  enormous. The great mound of Koyunjik--which represents the palaces of  Nineveh itself--covers an area of one hundred acres, and reaches an  elevation of 95 feet at its highest point. To heap up such a pile of  brick and earth \"would require the united exertions of 10,000 men for  twelve years, or of 20,000 men for six years.\"[L] Then only could the  construction of the palaces begin. The mound of Nebbi-Yunus, which has  not yet been excavated, covers an area of forty acres and is loftier and  steeper than its neighbor: \"its erection would have given full  employment to 10,000 men for the space of five years and a half.\"  Clearly, none but conquering monarchs, who yearly took thousands of  prisoners in battles and drove home into captivity a part of the  population of every country they subdued, could have employed such hosts  of workmen on their buildings--not once, but continually, for it seems  to have been a point of honor with the Assyrian kings that each should  build a new palace for himself.    [Illustration: 12.--TERRACE WALL AT KHORSABAD. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    8. When one considers the character of the land along the upper course  of the Tigris, where the Assyrians dwelt, one cannot help wondering why  they went on building mounds and using nothing but bricks in their  constructions. There is no reason for it in the nature of the country.  The cities of Assyria--NINEVEH (Koyunjik), KALAH (Nimrud), ARBELA,  DUR-SHARRUKIN (Khorsabad) were built in the midst of a hilly region  abounding in many varieties of stone, from soft limestone to hard  basalt; some of them actually stood on rocky ground, their moats being  in part cut through the rock. Had they wanted stone of better quality,  they had only to get it from the Zagros range of mountains, which skirts  all Assyria to the East, separating it from Media. Yet they never  availed themselves of these resources, which must have led to great  improvements in their architecture, and almost entirely reserved the use  of stone for ornamental purposes. This would tend to show, at all  events, that the Assyrians were not distinguished for inventive genius.  They had wandered northward from the lowlands, where they had dwelt for  centuries as a portion of the Chaldean nation. When they separated from  it and went off to found cities for themselves, they took with them  certain arts and tricks of handicraft learned in the old home, and never  thought of making any change in them. It does not even seem to have  occurred to them that by selecting a natural rocky elevation for their  buildings they would avoid the necessity of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#9)"],[1," the exception of the rabbit, all our English animals are found  in Norway--the badger, fox, hare, otter, squirrel, hedgehog, polecat,  stoat, and the rest of them. But besides these there are little Arctic  foxes and Arctic hares, with bluish-grey coats in the summer and  snowy-white ones in the winter. This change of colour is a provision  of Nature, rendering these particular animals, and some birds also,  almost invisible among the snows. The ermine is another instance of  this. In summer he is just an ugly little brown stoat; but in winter  he comes out in pure white, with a jet-black tip to his tail, a skin  worth a lot of money.    Of all these small Norwegian animals perhaps the most interesting  is the lemming, who, for some reason best known to himself, does not  trouble to put on a white coat in the winter, but keeps to his stripy  jacket all the year round. He lives everywhere--up on the mountains  and down in the valleys, and is hardly as large as an ordinary rat;  but woe betide the dog that brings him to bay, for if he finds his  road to escape barred, he will sit up and fight to the death, and he  knows how to bite. Yet he would much rather run away if he could,  as in ordinary life he is quite peacefully inclined, and feeds on  nothing more than grass and herbs and roots.    But there is a peculiarity about the lemming which makes the  country-folk of Norway more afraid of him than of any other animal. In  most years you may wander about the country for weeks and never see a  lemming, but occasionally there comes what is called a \"lemming-year,\"  when more young lemmings are born than usual, and then the trouble  begins. They eat up everything round about their homes, and they begin  to wander in search of food in packs of thousands, like swarms of  locusts. The farmers try to destroy them, but they soon give up the  attempt, as for days and days the lemmings come on in great waves,  eating up the grass and the crops wherever they pass. Except the sea,  nothing will stop them when once they have made a start; they come  down the mountain-sides, swim the rivers and streams, rush through the  forests, and, eating as they go, devastate the farm-lands. They do not  wander hither and thither, but keep to the same direction straight  ahead, until they eventually reach the sea. Whether they think that  it is only another river to be crossed, or whether they think that  they have done enough damage for one lifetime, nobody knows; but into  the sea they all plunge madly, and, of course, are soon drowned.    This, however, does not end the nuisance, for thousands of them  die as they sweep over the country, leaving their dead bodies to  poison the water, and thus making the people ill with what they term  \"lemming fever.\" So the pretty little lemmings are on occasions  more to be dreaded than are even bears and wolves, but fortunately  \"lemming-years\" do not come round very often, and the whole country  is not visited by the pest at the same time. They made their last  big raid in several districts in 1902, and they may come swarming  down from the mountains again any summer.    I must now say something about the wild animals which are helpful  to the people in that they provide them with food and bring money to  their pockets. Foxes and other fur-bearing animals will always fetch  good prices. There are also the hares, especially the white ones,  which are shot and snared in winter-time in great quantities, and  sold all over Europe. You may see them hanging up in the poulterers'  shops in London. Then there is that huge beast, the elk, almost as  big as a small horse, who roams about the forests like his Canadian  brother, the moose, and is hunted and shot for his flesh, skin, and  massive flat horns. Red deer there are also in some parts of Norway;  but the animal of greatest interest is undoubtedly the reindeer.    Up on the great mountain plateaux there are still plenty of wild  reindeer roaming about in large herds, and numbers of them are shot  every autumn by the farmers, who sell the skins, and dry the meat  to be eaten in the winter months. It is, however, the so-called tame  reindeer which are so invaluable to the people of the North. Without  them it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Laplanders to  exist, and without them thousands of Norwegians would be poor indeed.    It is a popular idea that, in the winter, reindeer draw the sleighs  all over Norway. As a matter of fact, it is only in the extreme North,  among the Lapps, that reindeer are employed for this kind of work; and  very few Europeans ever have the opportunity of enjoying a drive in a  reindeer \"pulk,\" as the queer sleigh is called. That the experience  is most exhilarating and exciting is certain. In the first place,  there is only one trace, connecting a kind of shoulder harness with  the forepart of the sleigh; again, there is only one rein coming from  a collar round the deer's neck, and consequently driving a reindeer  as we drive a horse is, of course, out of the question. All that  it is possible to do is to head him in the required direction, and  hope for the best. A jerk of the rein sets him going; and, as often  as not, he starts at a frantic gallop, kicking up the snow into the  driver's face until he is almost blinded, and careering right and  left at his own sweet will until he is tired. There is no difficulty  about keeping to the road, because there are no roads--only miles and  miles of snow, and the reindeer knows pretty well which way to go,  since the camping-places and habitations in these regions are limited.    Imagine what it would be like to jump into a boat-like \"pulk\" all  alone--for there is only room for one--twist the rein round your wrist,  give it a flick, and so away over the waste of snow, watching the  great antlers of the deer in front of you, and flinging yourself from  side to side to prevent capsizing. And, if you do happen to upset,  you must hang on to the rein like grim death and be dragged over the  snow, otherwise the reindeer will either fly like the wind and be lost,  or he may turn on you and attack you with his fore-hoofs.    These are the animals which are called the tame reindeer, but  their tameness only consists in the fact that they are kept in herds  together, and watched by men and dogs. They graze wherever they choose,  and the men and the dogs have to follow them. When they are wanted  for driving, to be milked, or to be killed, the Lapp has to lasso  them over the horns, from a distance of thirty or forty yards, for no  reindeer is ever sufficiently tame to permit a man to walk up to him.    The wealth of a Laplander depends on the number of reindeer which he  possesses. They carry his baggage and draw his sleighs when encampments  are moved; they provide him with milk and cheese, and, when killed,  with excellent meat. Their skins keep him warm at night, and out of  them are made boots, shoes, and leggings, as well as every kind of  article of leather which the Lapp has a use for. Horns, hoofs, and  bones all have their value, and not so long ago the women did all  their sewing with needles and threads made out of reindeer's bones  and sinews. Moreover, after supplying their own wants, the herdsmen  can sell the surplus meat and skins, and thus obtain the wherewithal  to buy other necessaries or luxuries.    Cows, horses, sheep, goats, or pigs would be out of place in Lapland,  and would find nothing to eat. But the \"camel of the Arctic Desert,\"  as the reindeer has been called, thrives in the cold without care or  shelter, and subsists on the moss, which he obtains by scraping deep  holes in the snow. Small wonder that he is a valuable beast to the  Laplander, who, however, repays him only with blows and lashes.    Farther south, on the Hardanger Fjeld and elsewhere, herds of tame  reindeer have now been established by Norwegian companies as a new  industry. Lapps are hired to look after them, and the meat is sold  in great quantities in many parts of Europe, especially in Paris. A  good trade is done also in the skins, for glove-making and other  purposes. It is by no means difficult to have a look at one of these  herds, and any visitor to Norway who finds himself within a day's  climb of the mountains whereon a herd is known to be grazing should do  his utmost to see the reindeer. He will find them not, like the deer  in Richmond Park, waiting to be looked at, but timid and restless,  and ready to take flight at the slightest provocation. Only the Lapp  herdsmen and their dogs are able to control these wild children of  a wild land.            CHAPTER XI    WILD NATURE--BIRDS      What a place Norway must be for birds'-nesting! There, if one went at  the right time, and did not mind roughing it, one might find eggs which  one could never come across in England, although laid by birds which  are called British. But the Norwegians protect a great many of their  birds by law in the same way as we do, and if this had only been done  a hundred years ago the Great Auk would not have disappeared for ever.    Most of our British birds are found in Norway at some time of the year,  and many of our rarer birds are almost common in Norway--golden eagles,  snowy owls, ravens, ring-ouzels, and crested tits, for instance. As  with us, there are resident birds and migratory birds. Nearly all the  kinds of birds which come from the South in the summer months to nest  in the British Isles also go farther North and nest in Norway. You will  find swallows, martins, cuckoos, warblers, and others of our summer  birds all nesting over there, and you will find some varieties of  southern birds which do not come to England, but go straight up from  Eastern or Central Europe to breed in the cool of the North. Amongst  these may be mentioned the blue-throated warbler, ortolan bunting,  Lapland bunting, shore lark, red-throated pipit, tree warbler, and  many others.    Then"]]]
