Perchance one turkey is minus her tail, the fox  having succeeded in getting only a mouthful of quills.    As the brood grows and their wings develop, they wander far from the  house in quest of grasshoppers. At such times they are all watchfulness  and suspicion. Crossing the fields one day, attended by a dog that much  resembled a fox, I came suddenly upon a brood about one third grown,  which were feeding in a pasture just beyond a wood. It so happened that  they caught sight of the dog without seeing me, when instantly, with the  celerity of wild game, they launched into the air, and, while the old  one perched upon a treetop, as if to keep an eye on the supposed enemy,  the young went sailing over the trees toward home.    The two hounds before referred to, accompanied by a cur-dog, whose  business it was to mind the farm, but who took as much delight in  running away from prosy duty as if he had been a schoolboy, would  frequently steal off and have a good hunt all by themselves, just for  the fun of the thing, I suppose. I more than half suspect that it was as  a kind of taunt or retaliation that Reynard came and took the geese  from under their very noses. One morning they went off and stayed till  the afternoon of the next day; they ran the fox all day and all night,  the hounds baying at every jump, the cur-dog silent and tenacious. When  the trio returned they came dragging themselves along, stiff, foot-sore,  gaunt, and hungry. For a day or two afterward they lay about the  kennels, seeming to dread nothing so much as the having to move. The  stolen hunt was their \"spree,\" and of course they must take time to get  over it.    Some old hunters think the fox enjoys the chase as much as the hound,  especially when the latter runs slowly, as the best hounds do. The fox  will wait for the hound, will sit down and listen, or play about,  crossing and recrossing and doubling upon his track, as if enjoying a  mischievous consciousness of the perplexity he would presently cause his  pursuer. It is evident, however, that the fox does not always have his  share of the fun: before a swift dog, or in a deep snow, or on a wet day  when his tail gets heavy, he must put his best foot forward. As a last  resort he \"holes up.\" Sometimes he resorts to numerous devices to  mislead and escape the dog altogether. He will walk in the bed of a  small creek, or on a rail-fence. I heard of an instance of a fox, hard  and long pressed, that took to a rail-fence, and, after walking some  distance, made a leap to one side to a hollow stump, in the cavity of  which he snugly stowed himself. The ruse succeeded, and the dogs lost  the trail; but the hunter, coming up, passed by chance near the stump,  when out bounded the fox, his cunning availing him less than he  deserved. On another occasion the fox took to the public road, and  stepped with great care and precision into a sleigh-track. The hard,  polished snow took no imprint of the light foot, and the scent was no  doubt less than it would have been on a rougher surface. Maybe, also,  the rogue had considered the chances of another sleigh coming along,  before the hound, and obliterating the trail entirely.    Audubon tells of a fox, which, when started by the hounds, always  managed to elude them at a certain point. Finally the hunter concealed  himself in the locality, to discover, if possible, the trick. Presently  along came the fox, and, making a leap to one side, ran up the trunk of  a fallen tree which had lodged some feet from the ground, and concealed  himself in the top. In a few minutes the hounds came up, and in their  eagerness passed some distance beyond the point, and then went still  farther, looking for the lost trail. Then the fox hastened down, and,  taking his back-track, fooled the dogs completely.    I was told of a silver-gray fox in northern New York, which, when  pursued by the hounds, would run till it had hunted up another fox, or  the fresh trail of one, when it would so manoeuvre that the hound would  invariably be switched off on the second track.    In cold, dry weather the fox will sometimes elude the hound, at least  delay him much, by taking to a bare, ploughed field. The hard, dry earth  seems not to retain a particle of the scent, and the hound gives a loud,  long, peculiar bark, to signify he has trouble. It is now his turn to  show his wit, which he often does by passing completely around the  field, and resuming the trail again where it crosses the fence or a  strip of snow.    The fact that any dry, hard surface is unfavorable to the hound  suggests, in a measure, the explanation of the wonderful faculty that  all dogs in a degree possess of tracking an animal by the scent of the  foot alone. Did you ever think why a dog's nose is always wet? Examine  the nose of a fox-hound, for instance; how very moist and sensitive!  Cause this moisture to dry up, and the dog would be as powerless to  track an animal as you are! The nose of the cat, you may observe, is  but a little moist, and, as you know, her sense of smell is far inferior  to that of the dog. Moisten your own nostrils and lips, and this sense  is plainly sharpened. The sweat of a dog's nose, therefore, is no doubt  a vital element in its power, and, without taking a very long logical  stride, we may infer how a damp, rough surface aids him in tracking  game.    A still hunt rarely brings you in sight of a fox, as his ears are much  sharper than yours, and his tread much lighter. But if the fox is  mousing in the fields, and you discover him before he does you, you may,  the wind favoring, call him within a few paces of you. Secrete yourself  behind the fence, or some other object, and squeak as nearly like a  mouse as possible. Reynard will hear the sound at an incredible  distance. Pricking up his ears, he gets the direction, and comes  trotting along as unsuspiciously as can be. I have never had an  opportunity to try the experiment, but I know perfectly reliable persons  who have. One man, in the pasture getting his cows, called a fox which  was too busy mousing to get the first sight, till it jumped upon the  wall just over where he sat secreted. He then sprang up, giving a loud  whoop at the same time, and the fox, I suspect, came as near being  frightened out of his skin as a fox ever was.    I have never been able to see clearly why the mother fox generally  selects a burrow or hole in the open field in which to have her young,  except it be, as some hunters maintain, for better security. The young  foxes are wont to come out on a warm day, and play like puppies in front  of the den. The view being unobstructed on all sides by trees or bushes,  in the cover of which danger might approach, they are less liable to  surprise and capture. On the slightest sound they disappear in the hole.  Those who have watched the gambols of the young foxes speak of them as  very amusing, even more arch and playful than those of kittens, while a  spirit profoundly wise and cunning seems to look out of their young  eyes. The parent fox can never be caught in the den with them, but is  hovering near the woods, which are always at hand, and by her warning  cry or bark telling them when to be on their guard. She usually has at  least three dens, at no great distance apart, and moves stealthily in  the night with her charge from one to the other, so as to mislead her  enemies. Many a party of boys, and of men, too, discovering the  whereabouts of a litter, have gone with shovels and picks, and, after  digging away vigorously for several hours, have found only an empty hole  for their pains. The old fox, finding her secret had been found out,  had waited for darkness, in the cover of which to transfer her household  to new quarters; or else some old fox-hunter, jealous of the  preservation of his game, and getting word of the intended destruction  of the litter, had gone at dusk the night before, and made some  disturbance about the den, perhaps flashed some powder in its mouth,--a  hint which the shrewd animal knew how to interpret.    The fox nearly always takes his nap during the day in the open fields,  along the sides of the ridges, or under the mountain, where he can look  down upon the busy farms beneath and hear their many sounds, the barking  of dogs, the lowing of cattle, the cackling of hens, the voices of men  and boys, or the sound of travel upon the highway. It is on that side,  too, that he keeps the sharpest lookout, and the appearance of the  hunter above and behind him is always a surprise.    Foxes, unlike wolves, never go in packs or companies, but hunt singly.  Many of the ways and manners of the fox, when tamed, are like the dog's.  I once saw a young red fox exposed for sale in the market in Washington.  A colored man had him, and said he had caught him out in Virginia. He  led him by a small chain, as he would a puppy, and the innocent young  rascal would lie on his side and bask and sleep in the sunshine, amid  all the noise and chaffering around him, precisely like a dog. He was  about the size of a full-grown cat, and there was a bewitching beauty  about him that I could hardly resist. On another occasion, I saw a gray  fox, about two thirds grown, playing with a dog, about the same size,  and by nothing in the manners of either could you tell which was the dog  and which was the fox.          VIII    THE WEASEL      My most interesting note of the season of 1893 relates to a weasel. One  day in early November, my boy and I were sitting on a rock at the edge  of a tamarack swamp in the woods, hoping to get a glimpse of some grouse  which we knew were in the habit of feeding in the swamp.

Clean  off the slate, Courtney. You and Vyse and I know it--nobody  else--Gilkins is dead. Come on, man! That boy of yours is a corker! I  love him--that little brother, Jim, of mine; and as for--Molly----\" His  voice broke and he turned sharply aside, saying: \"It's certainly  blue-bird weather, Courtney, and we all might as well go North. Come out  under the stars, and we'll talk it over.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was almost dawn when they returned. Marche's hand lay lightly on  Courtney's shoulder for a moment, as they parted.    Above, as Courtney stood feeling blindly for his door, Molly's door  swung softly ajar, and the girl came out in her night-dress.    \"Father,\" she whispered, \"is it all right?\"    \"All right, thank God, little daughter.\"    \"And--I may care for him?\"    \"Surely--surely, darling, because he is the finest specimen of manhood  that walks this merciless earth.\"    \"I knew it,\" she whispered gaily. \"If you'll lend me your wrapper a  moment, I'll go to his door and say good-night to him again.\"    Her father looked at her, picked up his tattered dressing-gown from his  bed, and wrapped her in it to the chin, then kissed her forehead.    So she trotted away to Marche's door and tapped softly; and when he  came and opened the door, she put her arms around his neck and kissed  him.    \"Good night,\" she whispered. \"I do love you, and I shall pray all night  that I may be everything that you would wish to have me. Good night,  once more--dearest of men--good night.\""]]]
