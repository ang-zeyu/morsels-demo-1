As he came nearer he  struck his shield with his sword and challenged the prince to battle.  The prince's sword almost leaped out of its scabbard at the martial  sound, and, like a true knight of Tara, he dashed against his foe, and  swinging his sword above his head, with one blow he clove the silver  helmet, and the strange warrior reeled from his horse and fell upon the  golden bridge. The prince, content with this achievement, spurred his  horse to pass the fallen champion, but the horse refused to stir, and  the bridge broke in two almost at his feet, and the part of it between  him and the mainland disappeared beneath the lake, carrying with it the  horse and the body of the champion, and before the prince could recover  from his surprise, his steed wheeled round and was galloping back, and  when he reached the land he rushed through the forest, and the prince  was not able to pull him up until he came to the palace door.    All that night the prince lay awake on his couch with his eyes fixed  upon the window, but no shadow fell upon the floor, and there was no  tapping at the pane, and with a heavy heart he joined the hunting party  in the morning. And day followed day, and his heart was sadder and  sadder, and found no pleasure in the joys and delights of fairyland. And  when all in the palace were at rest he used to roam through the forest,  always thinking of the Princess Ailinn, and hoping against hope that the  little woman would come again to him, but at last he began to despair of  ever seeing her. It chanced one night he rambled so far that he found  himself on the verge of the lake, at the very spot from which the golden  bridge had been thrown across the waters, and as he gazed wistfully upon  them a boat shot up and came swiftly to the bank, and who should he see  sitting in the stern but the little woman.    \"Ah, Cuglas, Cuglas,\" she said, \"I gave you three chances, and you  failed in all of them.\"    \"I should have borne the pain inflicted by the monster's claw,\" said  Cuglas. \"I should have borne the thirst on the sandy desert, and dashed  the crystal cup untasted from the fairy's hand; but I could never have  faced the nobles and chiefs of Erin if I had refused to meet the  challenge of the battle champion on the golden bridge.\"    \"And you would have been no true knight of Erin, and you would not have  been worthy of the wee girl who loves you, the bonny Princess Ailinn, if  you had refused to meet it,\" said the little woman; \"but for all that  you can never return to the fair hills of Erin. But cheer up, Cuglas,  there are mossy ways and forest paths and nestling bowers in fairyland.  Lonely they are, I know, in your eyes now,\" said the little woman; \"but  maybe,\" she added, with a laugh as musical as the ripple on a streamlet  when summer is in the air, \"maybe you won't always think them so  lonely.\"    \"You think I'll forget Ailinn for the fairy queen,\" said Cuglas, with a  sigh.    \"I don't think anything of the kind,\" said she.    \"Then what do you mean?\" said the prince.    \"Oh, I mean what I mean,\" said the little woman. \"But I can't stop here  all night talking to you: and, indeed, it is in your bed you ought to  be yourself. So now good-night; and I have no more to say, except that  perhaps, if you happen to be here this night week at this very hour,  when the moon will be on the waters, you will see---- But no matter what  you will see,\" said she; \"I must be off.\"    And before the prince could say another word the boat sped away from the  bank, and he was alone. He went back to the palace, and he fell asleep  that night only to dream of the Princess Ailinn.    As for the princess, she was pining away in the palace of Tara, the  color had fled from her cheeks, and her eyes, which had been once so  bright they would have lighted darkness like a star, lost nearly all  their luster, and the king's leeches could do nothing for her, and at  last they gave up all hope, and the king and queen of Erin and the  ladies of the court watched her couch by night and by day sadly waiting  for her last hour.    At length one day, when the sun was shining brightly over Tara's plain,  and its light, softened by the intervening curtains, was falling in the  sick chamber, the royal watchers noticed a sweet change coming over the  face of the princess; the bloom of love and youth were flushing on her  cheeks, and from her eyes shone out the old, soft, tender light, and  they began to hope she was about to be restored to them, when suddenly  the room was in darkness as if the night had swept across the sky, and  blotted out the sun. Then they heard the sound of fairy music, and over  the couch where the princess lay they beheld a gleam of golden light,  but only for a moment; and again there was perfect darkness, and the  fairy music ceased. Then, as suddenly as it came the darkness vanished,  the softened sunlight once more filled the chamber, and rested upon the  couch; but the couch was empty, and the royal watchers, looking at each  other, said in whispers: \"The fairies have carried away the Princess  Ailinn to fairyland.\"    Well, that very day the prince roamed by himself through the forest,  counting the hours until the day would fade in the sky and the moon come  climbing up, and at last, when it was shining full above the waters, he  went down to the verge of the lake, and he looked out over the gleaming  surface watching for the vision promised by the little woman. But he  could see nothing, and was about to turn away when he heard the faint  sound of fairy music. He listened and listened, and the sound came  nearer and clearer, and away in the distance, like drops of glistening  water breaking the level of the lake, he saw a fleet of fairy boats, and  he thought it was the fairy queen sailing in the moonlight. And it was  the fairy queen, and soon he was able to recognize the royal shallop  leading the others, and as it came close to the bank he saw the little  woman sitting in the prow between the little harpers, and at the stern  was the fairy queen, and by her side the lady of his heart, the Princess  Ailinn. In a second the boat was against the bank, and the princess in  his arms. And he kissed her again and again.    \"And have you never a kiss for me?\" said the little woman, tapping his  hand with the little gold bodkin.    \"A kiss and a dozen,\" said Cuglas, as he caught the little fairy up in  his arms.    \"Oh, fie, Cuglas,\" said the queen.    \"Oh, the princess isn't one bit jealous,\" said the little woman. \"Are  you, Ailinn?\"    \"Indeed I am not,\" said Ailinn.    \"And you should not be,\" said the fairy queen, \"for never lady yet had  truer knight than Cuglas. I loved him, and I love him dearly. I lured  him here hoping that in the delights of fairyland he might forget you.  It was all in vain. I know now that there is one thing no fairy power  above or below the stars, or beneath the waters, can ever subdue, and  that is love. And here together forever shall you and Cuglas dwell,  where old age shall never come upon you, and where pain or sorrow or  sickness is unknown.\"    And Cuglas never returned to the fair hills of Erin, and ages passed  away since the morning he followed the hounds into the fatal cave, but  his story was remembered by the firesides, and sometimes, even yet,  the herdboy watching his cattle in the fields hears the tuneful cry of  hounds, and follows it till it leads him to a darksome cave, and as  fearfully he listens to the sound becoming fainter and fainter he hears  the clatter of hoofs over the stony floor, and to this day the cave  bears the name of the prince who entered it never to return.[A]    [Footnote A: _Uaimh Bealach Conglais_, the cave of the road of  Cuglas--now Baltinglass--in the County Wicklow.]          THE HUNTSMAN'S SON      A long, long time ago there lived in a little hut on the borders of a  great forest a huntsman and his wife and son. From his earliest years  the boy, whose name was Fergus, used to hunt with his father in the  forest, and he grew up strong and active, sure and swift-footed as a  deer, and as free and fearless as the wind. He was tall and handsome; as  supple as a mountain ash, his lips were as red as its berries; his eyes  were as blue as the skies in spring; and his hair fell down over his  shoulders like a shower of gold. His heart was as light as a bird's,  and no bird was fonder of green woods and waving branches. He had lived  since his birth in the hut in the forest, and had never wished to leave  it, until one winter night a wandering minstrel sought shelter there,  and paid for his night's lodging with songs of love and battle. Ever  since that night Fergus pined for another life. He no longer found joy  in the music of the hounds or in the cries of the huntsmen in forest  glades. He yearned for the chance of battle, and the clang of shields,  and the fierce shouts of fighting warriors, and he spent all his spare  hours practicing on the harp and learning the use of arms, for in those  days the bravest warriors were also bards. In this way the spring and  summer and autumn passed; and when the winter came again it chanced that  on a stormy night, when thunder was rattling through the forest, smiting  the huge oaks and hurling them crashing to the earth, Fergus lay awake  thinking of his present lot, and wondering what the future might have in  store for him. The lightning was playing around the hut, and every now  and then a flash brightened up the interior.    After a peal, louder than any which had preceded it, Fergus heard three  loud knocks at the door. He called out to his parents that someone was  knocking.    \"If that is so,\" said his father, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22169"],[0,"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs (#9)"],[1," the Barbarossa of modern writers, and it is probable that  the name was given to him originally under some impression that it was  of the nature of a family name.

No one appreciated better the triumphs of the Beglerbeg of Algiers  than Sultan Suleym[=a]n. The Ottomans, as yet inexperienced in naval  affairs, were eager to take lessons. The Turkish navy had been of slow  growth, chiefly because in early days there were always people ready  to act as sailors for pay. When Mur[=a]d I. wished to cross from Asia  to Europe to meet the invading army of Vladislaus and Hunyady, the  Genoese skippers were happy to carry over his men for a ducat a head,  just to spite their immemorial foes the Venetians, who were enlisted  on the other side. It was not till the fall of Constantinople gave the  Turks the command of the Bosphorus that Mohammed II. resolved to  create for himself a naval power.    That fatal jealousy between the Christian States which so often aided  the progress of the Turks helped them now. The great commercial  republics, Genoa and Venice, had long been struggling for supremacy on  the sea. Venice held many important posts among the islands of the  Archipelago and on the Syrian coast, where the Crusaders had rewarded  her naval assistance with the gift of the fortress of Acre. Genoa was  stronger in the Black Sea and Marmora, where, until the coming of the  Turks, her colony at Galata was little less than an Oriental Genoa.  The Genoese tower is still seen on the steep slope of Pera, and  Genoese forts are common objects in the Bosphorus, and in the Crimea,  where they dominate the little harbour of Balaklava. The Sea of  Marmora was the scene of many a deadly contest between the rival  fleets. In 1352, under the walls of Constantinople, the Genoese  defeated the combined squadrons of the Venetians, the Catalonians, and  the Greeks. But next year the Bride of the Sea humbled the pride of  Genoa in a disastrous engagement off Alghero; and in 1380, when the  Genoese had gained possession of Chioggia and all but occupied Venice  itself, the citizens rose like one man to meet the desperate  emergency, and not only repulsed, but surrounded the invaders, and  forced them to capitulate. From this time Genoa declined in power,  while Venice waxed stronger and more haughty. The conquest of  Constantinople by the Turks, followed rapidly by the expulsion of the  Genoese from Trebizond, Sinope, Kaffa, and Azov, was the end of the  commercial prosperity of the Ligurian Republic in the East. The Black  Sea and Marmora were now Turkish lakes. The Castles of the  Dardanelles, mounted with heavy guns, protected any Ottoman fleet from  pursuit; and though Giacomo Veniero defiantly carried his own ship  under fire through the strait and back again with the loss of only  eleven men, no one cared to follow his example.    [Illustration: AN ADMIRAL'S GALLEY    (_Furttenbach, Architectura Navalis, 1629._)]    When Mohammed II. issued forth with a fleet of one hundred galleys and  two hundred transports, carrying seventy thousand troops, and ravished  the Negropont away from Venice in 1470, he had only to repass the  Hellespont to be absolutely safe. All that the Venetian admirals, the  famous Loredani, could do was to retaliate upon such islands of the  Archipelago as were under Turkish sway and ravage the coasts of Asia  Minor. Superior as they were to the Turks in the building and  management of galleys, they had not the military resources of their  foe. Their troops were mercenaries, not to be compared with the  Janissaries and Sip[=a]his, though the hardy Stradiotes from Epirus,  dressed like Turks, but without the turban, of whom Othello is a  familiar specimen, came near to rivalling them. On land, the Republic  could not meet the troops of the Grand Signior, and after her very  existence had been menaced by the near approach of a Turkish army on  the banks of the Piave[13] (1477), Venice made peace, and even, it is  said, incited the Turks to the capture of Otranto. The Ottoman galleys  were now free of the Adriatic, and carried fire and sword along the  Italian coast, insomuch that whenever the crescent was seen at a  vessel's peak the terrified villagers fled inland, and left their  homes at the mercy of the pirates. The period of the Turkish Corsairs  had already begun.    There was another naval power to be reckoned with besides discredited  Genoa and tributary Venice. The Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem,  driven from Smyrna (in 1403) by Timur, had settled at Rhodes, which  they hastened to render impregnable. Apparently they succeeded, for  attack after attack from the Maml[=u]k Sultans of Egypt failed to  shake them from their stronghold, whence they commanded the line of  commerce between Alexandria and Constantinople, and did a brisk trade  in piracy upon passing vessels. The Knights of Rhodes were the  Christian Corsairs of the Levant; the forests of Caramania furnished  them with ships, and the populations of Asia Minor supplied them with  slaves. So long as they roved the seas the Sultan's galleys were ill  at ease. Even Christian ships suffered from their high-handed  proceedings, and Venice looked on with open satisfaction when, in  1480, Mohammed II. despatched one hundred and sixty ships and a large  army to humble the pride of the Knights. The siege failed, however;  D'Aubusson, the Grand Master, repulsed the general assault with  furious heroism, and the Turks retired with heavy loss.[14]    Finding that the Ottomans were not quite invincible, Venice plucked up  heart, and began to prepare for hostilities with her temporary ally.  The interval of friendliness had been turned to good account by the  Turks. Y[=a]ni, the Christian shipbuilder of the Sultan, had studied  the improvements of the Venetians, and he now constructed two immense  _kokas_, seventy cubits long and thirty in the beam, with masts of  several trees spliced together, measuring four cubits round. Forty men  in armour might stand in the maintop and fire down upon the enemy.  There were two decks, one like a galleon's deck, and the other like a  galley, each with a big gun on either side. Four-and-twenty oars a  side, on the upper deck, were propelled each by nine men. Boats hung  from the stern; and the ship's complement consisted (so says H[=a]jji  Khal[=i]fa)[15] of two thousand soldiers and sailors. Kem[=a]l Reis  and Bor[=a]k Reis commanded these two prodigies, and the whole fleet,  numbering some three hundred other vessels, was despatched to the  Adriatic under the command of Da[=u]d Pasha. The object of attack was  Lepanto.    Towards the end of July, 1499, they sighted the Venetian fleet, which  was on the look-out for them, off Modon. They counted forty-four  galleys, sixteen galleasses, and twenty-eight ordinary sail. Neither  courted an action, which each knew to be fraught with momentous  consequences. Grimani, the Venetian admiral, retired to Navarino; the  Turks anchored off Sapienza. On August 12th Da[=u]d Pasha, who knew  the Sultan was awaiting him with the land forces at Lepanto, resolved  to push on at all costs. In those days Turkish navigators had little  confidence in the open sea; they preferred to hug the shore, where  they might run into a port in case of bad weather. Da[=u]d accordingly  endeavoured to pass between the island of Prodano and the Morea, just  north of Navarino. Perfectly aware of his course, the Venetians had  drawn out their fleet at the upper end of the narrow passage, where  they had the best possible chance of catching the enemy in confused  order. The Proveditore of Corfu, Andrea Loredano, had reinforced the  Christian fleet that very day with ten ships; the position was well  chosen; the wind was fair, and drove full down upon the Turks as they  emerged from the strait. But the Venetian admiral placed his chief  reliance in his galleasses, and as yet the art of manoeuvring sailing  vessels in battle array was in its youth. Bad steering here, a wrong  tack there, and then ship ran against ship, the great galleasses  became entangled and helpless, carried by the wind into the midst of  the enemy, or borne away where they were useless, and the Turkish  galleys had it all their own way. Loredano's flagship burnt down to  the water, and other vessels were destroyed by fire. Y[=a]ni's big  ships played an important part in the action. Two galleasses, each  containing a thousand men, and two other vessels, surrounded Bor[=a]k  Reis, but the smaller ships could not fire over the _koka's_ lofty  sides, and were speedily sunk. Bor[=a]k Reis threw burning pitch into  the galleasses, and burnt up crews and ships, till, his own vessel  catching fire, he and other notable captains, after performing  prodigies of valour, perished in the flames. Wherefore the island of  Prodano is by the Turks called Bor[=a]k Isle to this day.[16] To the  Christians the action was known as \"the deplorable battle of Zonchio,\"  from the name of the old castle of Navarino, beneath which it was  fought.    [Illustration: GALLEASSE.    (_Furttenbach, Architectura Navalis, 1620._)]    In spite of his success at Zonchio, Da[=u]d Pasha had still to fight  his way up to Lepanto. The Venetians had collected their scattered  fleet, and had been reinforced by their allies of France and Rhodes;  it was clear they were bent on revenge. The Turks hugged the land,  dropped anchor at night, and kept a sharp look-out. It was a perpetual  skirmish all the way. The Venetians tried to"]]]
