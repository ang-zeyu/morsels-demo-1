Harvey obeyed. \"Lower till that rope-loop--on the  after-leach--kris--no, it's cringle--till the cringle was down on the  boom. Then I'd tie her up the way you said, and then I'd hoist up the  peak-and throat-halyards again.\"    \"You've forgot to pass the tack-earing, but wid time and help ye'll  l'arn. There's good and just reason for ivry rope aboard, or else  'twould be overboard. D'ye follow me? 'Tis dollars an' cents I'm  puttin' into your pocket, ye skinny little supercargo, so that fwhin  ye've filled out ye can ship from Boston to Cuba an' tell thim Long  Jack l'arned you. Now I'll chase ye around a piece, callin' the ropes,  an' you'll lay your hand on thim as I call.\"    He began, and Harvey, who was feeling rather tired, walked slowly to  the rope named. A rope's end licked round his ribs, and nearly knocked  the breath out of him.    \"When you own a boat,\" said Tom Platt, with severe eyes, \"you can walk.  Till then, take all orders at the run. Once more--to make sure!\"    Harvey was in a glow with the exercise, and this last cut warmed him  thoroughly. Now, he was a singularly smart boy, the son of a very  clever man and a very sensitive woman, with a fine resolute temper that  systematic spoiling had nearly turned to mulish obstinacy. He looked at  the other men, and saw that even Dan did not smile. It was evidently  all in the day's work, though it hurt abominably; so he swallowed the  hint with a gulp and a gasp and a grin. The same smartness that led him  to take such advantage of his mother made him very sure that no one on  the boat, except, maybe, Penn, would stand the least nonsense. One  learns a great deal from a mere tone. Long Jack called over half a  dozen more ropes, and Harvey danced over the deck like an eel at  ebb-tide, one eye on Tom Platt.    \"Ver' good. Ver' good done,\" said Manuel. \"After supper I show you a  little schooner I make, with all her ropes. So we shall learn.\"    \"Fust-class fer--a passenger,\" said Dan. \"Dad he's jest allowed you'll  be wuth your salt maybe 'fore you're draownded. Thet's a heap fer dad.  I'll learn you more our next watch together.\"    \"Taller!\" grunted Disko, peering through the fog as it smoked over the  bows. There was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging  jib-boom, while alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn, pale  waves whispering and upping one to the other.    \"Now I'll learn you something Long Jack can't,\" shouted Tom Platt, as  from a locker by the stern he produced a battered deep-sea lead  hollowed at one end, smeared the hollow from a saucer full of mutton  tallow, and went forward. \"I'll learn you how to fly the Blue Pigeon.  Shooo!\"    Disko did something to the wheel that checked the schooner's way, while  Manuel, with Harvey to help (and a proud boy was Harvey), let down the  jib in a lump on the boom. The lead sung a deep droning song as Tom  Platt whirled it round and round.    \"Go ahead, man,\" said Long Jack, impatiently. \"We're not drawin'  twenty-five fut off Fire Island in a fog. There's no trick to ut.\"    \"Don't be jealous, Galway.\" The released lead plopped into the sea far  ahead as the schooner surged slowly forward.    \"Soundin' is a trick, though,\" said Dan, \"when your dipsey lead's all  the eye you're like to hev for a week. What d'you make it, dad?\"    Disko's face relaxed. His skill and honour were involved in the march  he had stolen on the rest of the fleet, and he had his reputation as a  master artist who knew the Banks blindfold. \"Sixty, mebbe--ef I'm any  judge,\" he replied, with a glance at the tiny compass in the window of  the house.    \"Sixty,\" sung out Tom Platt, hauling in great wet coils.    The schooner gathered way once more. \"Heave!\" said Disko, after a  quarter of an hour.    \"What d'you make it?\" Dan whispered, and he looked at Harvey proudly.  But Harvey was too proud of his own performances to be impressed just  then.    \"Fifty,\" said the father. \"I mistrust we're right over the nick o'  Green Bank on old Sixty-Fifty.\"    \"Fifty!\" roared Tom Platt. They could scarcely see him through the fog.  \"She's bu'st within a yard--like the shells at Fort Macon.\"    \"Bait up, Harve,\" said Dan, diving for a line on the reel.    The schooner seemed to be straying promiscuously through the smother,  her head-sail banging wildly. The men waited and looked at the boys,  who began fishing.    \"Heugh!\" Dan's lines twitched on the scored and scarred rail. \"Now haow  in thunder did dad know? Help us here, Harve. It's a big un.  Poke-hooked, too.\" They hauled together, and landed a goggle-eyed  twenty-pound cod. He had taken the bait right into his stomach.    \"Why, he's all covered with little crabs,\" cried Harvey, turning him  over.    \"By the great hook-block, they're lousy already,\" said Long Jack.  \"Disko, ye kape your spare eyes under the keel.\"    Splash went the anchor, and they all heaved over the lines, each man  taking his own place at the bulwarks.    \"Are they good to eat?\" Harvey panted, as he lugged in another  crab-covered cod.    \"Sure. When they're lousy it's a sign they've all been herdin' together  by the thousand, and when they take the bait that way they're hungry.  Never mind how the bait sets. They'll bite on the bare hook.\"    \"Say, this is great!\" Harvey cried, as the fish came in gasping and  splashing--nearly all poke-hooked, as Dan had said. \"Why can't we  always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?\"    \"Allus can, till we begin to dress-daown. Efter thet, the heads and  offals 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy. Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned  progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows. Guess we'll  run aout aour trawl to-night. Harder on the back, this, than frum the  dory, ain't it?\"    It was rather back-breaking work, for in a dory the weight of a cod is  water-borne till the last minute, and you are, so to speak, abreast of  him; but the few feet of a schooner's free-board make so much extra  dead-hauling, and stooping over the bulwarks cramps the stomach. But it  was wild and furious sport so long as it lasted; and a big pile lay  aboard when the fish ceased biting.    \"Where's Penn and Uncle Salters?\" Harvey asked, slapping the slime off  his oilskins, and reeling up the line in careful imitation of the  others.    \"Git's coffee and see.\"    Under the yellow glare of the lamp on the pawl-post, the fo'c'sle table  down and opened, utterly unconscious of fish or weather, sat the two  men, a checker-board between them, Uncle Salters snarling at Penn's  every move.    \"What's the matter naow?\" said the former, as Harvey, one hand in the  leather loop at the head of the ladder, hung shouting to the cook.    \"Big fish and lousy-heaps and heaps,\" Harvey replied, quoting Long  Jack. \"How's the game?\"    Little Penn's jaw dropped. \"Tweren't none o' his fault,\" snapped Uncle  Salters. \"Penn's deef.\"    \"Checkers, weren't it?\" said Dan, as Harvey staggered aft with the  steaming coffee in a tin pail. \"That lets us out o' cleanin' up  to-night. Dad's a jest man. They'll have to do it.\"    \"An' two young fellers I know'll bait up a tub or so o' trawl, while  they're cleanin',\" said Disko, lashing the wheel to his taste.    \"Urn! 'Guess I'd ruther clean up, dad.\"    \"Don't doubt it. Ye wun't, though. Dress-daown! Dress-daown! Penn'll  pitch while you two bait up.\"    \"Why in thunder didn't them blame boys tell us you'd struck on?\" said  Uncle Salters, shuffling to his place at the table. \"This knife's  gum-blunt, Dan.\"    \"Ef stickin' out cable don't wake ye, guess you'd better hire a boy o'  your own,\" said Dan, muddling about in the dusk over the tubs full of  trawl-line lashed to windward of the house. \"Oh, Harve, don't ye want  to slip down an' git's bait?\"    \"Bait ez we are,\" said Disko. \"I mistrust shag-fishin' will pay better,  ez things go.\"    That meant the boys would bait with selected offal of the cod as the  fish were cleaned--an improvement on paddling barehanded in the little  bait-barrels below. The tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a  big hook each few feet; and the testing and baiting of every single  hook, with the stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear  when shot from the dory, was a scientific business. Dan managed it in  the dark without looking, while Harvey caught his fingers on the barbs  and bewailed his fate. But the hooks flew through Dan's fingers like  tatting on an old maid's lap. \"I helped bait up trawl ashore 'fore I  could well walk,\" he said. \"But it's a putterin' job all the same. Oh,  dad!\" This shouted towards the hatch, where Disko and Tom Platt were  salting. \"How many skates you reckon we'll need?\"    \"Baout three. Hurry!\"    \"There's three hundred fathom to each tub,\" Dan explained; \"more'n  enough to lay out tonight. Ouch! 'Slipped up there, I did.\" He stuck  his finger in his mouth. \"I tell you, Harve, there ain't money in  Gloucester'u'd hire me to ship on a reg'lar trawler. It may be  progressive, but, barrin' that, it's the putterin'est, slimjammest  business top of earth.\"    \"I don't know what this is, if 'tisn't regular trawling,\" said Harvey,  sulkily. \"My fingers are all cut to frazzles.\"    \"Pshaw! This is jest one o' dad's blame experiments. He don't trawl  'less there's mighty good reason fer it. Dad knows. Thet's why he's  baitin' ez he is. We'll hev her saggin' full when we take her up er we  won't see a fin.\"    Penn and Uncle Salters cleaned up as Disko had ordained, but the boys  profited little. No sooner were the tubs furnished than Tom Platt and  Long Jack, who had been exploring the inside of a dory with a lantern,  snatched them away, loaded up the tubs and some small, painted  trawl-buoys, and hove the boat overboard into what Harvey regarded as  an exceedingly rough sea. \"They'll be drowned. Why, the dory's loaded  like a freight-car,\" he cried.    \"We'll be back,\" said Long Jack, \"an'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#9)"],[1," An inscription in a church at Tirnova records his prowess:        In the year 1230, I, John Assen, Czar and Autocrat of the      Bulgarians, obedient to God in Christ, son of the old Assen,      have built this most worthy church from its foundations, and      completely decked it with paintings in honour of the Forty holy      Martyrs, by whose help, in the 12th year of my reign, when the      church had just been painted, I set out to Roumania to the war      and smote the Greek army and took captive the Czar Theodore      Komnenus with all his nobles. And all lands have I conquered      from Adrianople to Durazzo, the Greek, the Albanian, and the      Servian land. Only the towns round Constantinople and that city      itself did the Franks hold; but these too bowed themselves      beneath the hand of my sovereignty, for they had no other Czar      but me, and prolonged their days according to my will, as God      had so ordained. For without Him no word or work is      accomplished. To Him be honour for ever. Amen.    John Assen II. was a great administrator as well as a great soldier.  Whilst he declared the Church of Bulgaria independent, repudiating alike  the Churches of Rome and of Constantinople, he tolerated all religions  and gave sound encouragement to education. With his death passed away  the last of the glory of ancient Bulgaria. Her story now was to be of  almost unrelieved misfortune until the culminating misery of the Turkish  conquest.    Internal dissensions, wars with the Venetians, the Hungarians, the  Serbs, the Greeks, the Tartars,--all these vexed Bulgaria. The country  became subject for a time to the Tartars, then recovered its  independence, then came under the dominion of Servia after the battle of  Kostendil (1330). The Servians, closely akin by blood, proved kind  conquerors, and for some years the two Slav peoples of the Balkans kept  peace by a common policy in which Bulgaria, if dependent, was not  enslaved. But the Turk was rapidly pouring into Europe. In 1366 the  Bulgarian Czar, Sisman III., agreed to become the vassal of the Turkish  Sultan Murad, and the centuries of subjection to the Turk began. After  the battle of Kossovo the grip of the Turk on Bulgaria was tightened.  Tirnova was captured, the nobles of the nation massacred, the national  freedom obliterated. The desire for independence barely survived. But  there was one happy circumstance:        \"It is a noteworthy fact,\" writes a Bulgarian authority, \"that      the Osmanlis, being themselves but little civilised, did not      attempt to assimilate the Bulgarians in the sense in which      civilised nations try to effect the intellectual and ethnic      assimilation of a subject race. Except in isolated cases, where      Bulgarian girls or young men were carried off and forced to      adopt Mohammedanism, the Government never took any general      measures to impose Mohammedanism or assimilate the Bulgarians to      the Moslems. The Turks prided themselves on keeping apart from      the Bulgarians, and this was fortunate for our nationality.      Contented with their political supremacy and pleased to feel      themselves masters, the Turks did not trouble about the      spiritual life of the _rayas_, except to try to trample out all      desires for independence. All these circumstances contributed to      allow the Bulgarian people, crushed and ground down by the      Turkish yoke, to concentrate and preserve their own inner      spiritual life. They formed religious communities attached to      the churches. These had a certain amount of autonomy, and,      beside seeing after the churches, could keep schools. The      national literature, full of the most poetic melancholy, handed      down from generation to generation and developed by tradition,      still tells us of the life of the Bulgarians under the Ottoman      yoke. In these popular songs, the memory of the ancient      Bulgarian kingdom is mingled with the sufferings of the present      hour. The songs of this period are remarkable for the Oriental      character of their tunes, and this is almost the sole trace of      Moslem influence.        \"In spite of the vigilance of the Turks, the religious      associations served as centres to keep alive the national      feeling. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, when      Russia declared war against Turkey (1827), Bulgaria awoke.\"    From 1366 to 1827 Bulgaria had been enslaved by the Turk. Now within the  space of a few days and with hardly an effort on her own behalf, she was  suddenly to be restored to independence.    [Illustration: ROUSTCHOUK, ON THE DANUBE]          CHAPTER V    THE LIBERATION OF BULGARIA      Significantly enough, the first sign of a renaissance of Bulgarian  national feeling was an agitation not against the Turks but the Greeks.  Patriotic Bulgarians, under the Sublime Porte, sought to re-establish  their old National Church and shake it free from its subjection to the  Greek Patriarch at Constantinople. The Sublime Porte was induced to look  upon this demand with favour. A step which promised to emphasise the  divisions between the Christians evidently should be of advantage to the  Turks. The Greek Patriarch was urged to consent to the appointment of a  Bulgarian bishop. He refused. In the face of that refusal Turkey acted  as the creator of a new Christian Church, and in 1870 a firman of the  Sultan created the Bulgarian Exarchate, and Bulgaria had again a  national ecclesiastical organisation. Two years later the first Exarch  was elected by the Bulgarian clergy. But gratitude for this religious  concession did not extinguish the longings for political independence of  the Bulgarian people. When a Christian insurrection broke out in  Herzegovina against Turkey in 1875, the Bulgarian patriots rose in arms  in different parts of their country. The massacres of Batak were the  Turkish response, those \"Bulgarian atrocities\" which sent a shudder  through all Europe and set a term to Turkish rule over the Christian  populations in her European provinces.    I have been recently in the Balkans with the veteran war artist, Mr.  Frederick Villiers, who has personal recollections of those times of  massacre and atrocity. Speaking with him, an eye-witness of the  devastation then wrought, it was possible to understand the fierce  indignation with which the English-speaking world was stirred as the  details of the horrors in the Balkans were unveiled. In all about 12,000  Bulgarian people perished, mostly butchered in cold blood. Turkish  anger, it seems, was inflamed against the Bulgarians, because, in spite  of the recent church concession, some of them had dared to strike for  freedom; and this display of Turkish anger made the full freedom of  Bulgaria certain.    [Illustration: \"MYSTERY\"--A STUDY IN THE ROUSTCHOUK DISTRICT]    At first an attempt had been made by the Powers to exert peaceful  pressure upon Turkey, so that her Christian provinces should be granted  local autonomy. The project of the Powers for Bulgaria proposed that the  districts inhabited by Bulgarians should be divided into two provinces;  the Eastern Province, with Tirnovo as capital, was to include the  Sandjaks of Roustchouk, Tirnovo, Toultcha, Varna, Sliven, Philippopolis  (not including Sultan-Eri and Ahi-Tchelebi), the kazas of Kirk Kilisse,  Mustapha Pasha and Kasilagatch; and the Western Province, with Sofia as  capital, the Sandjaks of Sofia, Vidin, Nisch, Uskub, Monastir, the three  kazas of the north of Seres, and the kazas of Stroumitza, Tikvesch,  Veles, and Kastoria. Districts of from five to ten thousand inhabitants  were to stand as the administrative unit. Christian and Mohammedans were  to be settled homogeneously in these districts. Each district was to  have at its head a mayor and a district council, elected by universal  suffrage, and was to enjoy entire autonomy as regards local affairs.  Several districts would form a Sandjak with a prefect at its head who  was to be Christian or Mohammedan, according to the majority of the  population of the Sandjak. He would be proposed by the Governor-General,  and nominated by the Porte for four years.    Finally, every two Sandjaks were to be administered by a Christian  Governor-General nominated by the Porte for five years, with consent of  the Powers. He would govern the province with the help of a provincial  assembly, composed of representatives chosen by the district councils  for a term of four years, at the rate of one deputy to thirty or forty  thousand inhabitants. This assembly would nominate an administrative  council of ten members. The provincial assembly would be summoned every  year to decide the budget and the taxes. The armed force was to be  concentrated in the towns and there would be local militia beside. The  language of the predominant nationality was to be employed, as well as  Turkish. Finally, a Commission of International Control was to supervise  the working of these proposals.    The Porte promised reforms on these lines, but did not go beyond  promising. The task of forcing her to end a cruel tyranny was one for  the battlefield.    The Russo-Turkish War broke out on April 12, 1877, and what Turkey had  refused to yield of her own accord was wrested from her by force of  arms, in the preliminary treaty of San Stefano. By this treaty, Bulgaria  was made an autonomous principality subject to Turkey, with a Christian  government and national militia. The Prince of Bulgaria was to be freely  chosen by the Bulgarian people and accepted by the Sublime Porte, with  the consent of the Powers. It was agreed that an assembly of notables,  presided over by a Russian Commissioner and attended by a Turkish  Commissioner, should meet at Philippopolis or Tirnovo before the  election of the Prince to draw up a constitutional statute similar to  those of the other Danubian principalities agreed to after the Treaty of"]]]
