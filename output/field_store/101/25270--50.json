I  almost wish that we might delay our journey a little.\"    \"That cannot be,\" returned Pedro, with decision.  \"Besides, it is  unnecessary, for I have spoken to our host, and told him to take good  care of the fellow.\"    Lawrence could scarcely forbear smiling at the quiet assurance with  which Pedro spoke.    \"Surely,\" he said, \"you cannot count on his being influenced by your  commands after you are gone?\"    \"Yes, senhor, I can count on that, for he knows me, and I occasionally  pass this way.\"    Pedro turned away as he spoke and went towards the mules, the fastenings  of whose loads he carefully inspected.  Lawrence went to look after his  own animal with his mind much relieved, for the manner of Pedro was such  as to inspire irresistible, almost blind, confidence.    During the first mile or two, as they rode along, our hero puzzled  himself in a vain attempt to analyse the cause of this confidence.  Was  it the result of that imperturbable self-possession and invariable  readiness of resource which marked the guide; or was it the stern  truthfulness of his dark eyes, coupled with the retiring modesty and  gravity of his demeanour?  Perhaps it was the union of these  characteristics.  He could not tell.    While thus engaged in profound thought he was roused by Manuela riding  alongside of him, and pointing upwards with animated looks while she  exclaimed--    \"See--look--senhor!\"    Much surprised, for this was the first time during the journey that the  girl had ventured to attract his attention, the youth looked in the  direction indicated, and certainly the view that met his eyes was  calculated to banish not only the surprise, but all other feelings save  those of admiration of Nature and reverence for Nature's God.    They had just rounded one of those rocky bluffs which so frequently  interrupted their view during their upward journey, and had come upon a  scene which they could not find words adequately to describe.  As  interjectional phrases alone could indicate something of their emotions  to each other, so fragmentary sentences alone will convey a faint  semblance of the truth to the intelligence of the reader.    Mountains, glens, and mighty cliffs; hideous precipices and yawning  gulfs; snow-clad summits high above them, and rock-riven gorges far  below.  Distance upon distance ranging backward and upward to infinity,  where all was mingled with cloudland; sunlit here, darkest shadowed  there--wildness, weirdness, grandeur, and magnificence everywhere!    In the immediate foreground the serpentine path wound upward among  rugged rocks, and the riders, picking their steps, as it were, midway up  the face of a stupendous precipice, looked upward on the left at an  apparently summitless wall, and downward on the right into an almost  bottomless valley, through which a river roared as if mad with joy at  having escaped its glacier-prison; though its roaring was softened  well-nigh to silence by distance, while in appearance it seemed little  larger than a silver thread.    \"I could almost believe that to be a giant's castle,\" remarked Lawrence,  pointing to the opposite side of the ravine, where a huge perpendicular  mountain of porphyry was so broken into turrets, towers, and  battlements, that it was difficult, except for its size, to believe it  other than the work of man.  There were even holes and formations about  it that had the appearance of antique windows, gates, and drawbridges!    \"Yes, it is a strange place,\" said the guide, checking his mule;  \"moreover, we must spend the night under its shadow, for it is  impossible to reach a better place of shelter to-night; and, by good  fortune, yonder is something fresh for supper.\"    Pedro pointed to a spot about seven or eight hundred yards distant,  where a group of guanacos stood gazing at the intruders with profound  attention.    \"How will you get near enough for a shot?\" asked Lawrence; \"they will be  gone before you can get across the ravine, and there is little or no  cover.\"    \"You shall see,\" said Pedro, cocking his rifle.    \"But--but no weapon short of a cannon will carry so far--at least with  accuracy,\" exclaimed Lawrence in surprise, for at the time of which we  write breech-loaders and the long-range weapons of precision had not  been introduced in those regions.  Indeed, the armies of South America,  and of Europe also, still slew each other with the familiar Brown Bess  and the clumsy flint-lock at that time.    Pedro paid no attention to the remark, but, dismounting, slowly raised  the rifle to his shoulder.  The guide was one of those men who seem to  live in advance of their age.  He had thought out, and carried out in a  rough-and-ready manner, ideas which have since been scientifically  reduced to practice.  Being well aware that any projectile is drawn  downward in its flight by the law of gravitation, and that if you want  to hit a distant point you must aim considerably above it, he had, by  careful experiment, found out how high above an object at a given  distance one must aim in order to hit, and, by constant practice in  judging distance, as well as in taking aim above his mark, he had  attained to such skill as a long-range marksman that his friends almost  believed it impossible for game to get beyond the range of his deadly  weapon, and foes never felt easy till they were entirely out of his  sight.  The comparative slowness, too, of the flint-lock in discharging  a rifle, had necessitated in him a degree of steadiness, not only while  taking aim, but even after pulling the trigger, which rendered him what  we might term statuesque in his action as he levelled his piece.    For a few seconds the rock beside him was not more steady.  Then the  cliffs burst into a fusillade of echoes, and the guanacos leaped wildly  up the mountain-side, leaving one of their number on the rocks behind  them.    It was some time before the young Englishman could get over his  astonishment at this feat, for Pedro had pointed his weapon so high that  he did not appear to be aiming at the animal at all, and he maintained  an animated discussion with the mountaineer until they reached a part of  the pass which proved to be somewhat dangerous.    And here they met with a party of muleteers crossing the mountains in  the opposite direction.  They were still far above them when first  observed descending the same steep and narrow road.    \"We will wait here till they pass,\" said the guide, pulling up at a  point where the width of the track was considerable.  \"I see by the  escort that they carry something of value--probably bars of silver from  one of the mines.  They have reached the worst part of the pass.  I  shouldn't wonder to see one of the mules go over--they often do.\"    \"And always get killed, I suppose,\" said Lawrence.    \"Not always.  Now and then they have wonderful escapes, but many  hundreds have been lost here.  See!\"    As he spoke one of the baggage-mules of the party touched the cliff with  its load.  This caused the animal to stagger; his hind-legs actually  went over the precipice, and the loose stones began to roll away from  under his hoofs.  With his fore-feet, however, still on the narrow  track, he held on bravely, even sticking his nose on the ground, so that  he had the appearance of holding on by his teeth!  Two of the peons  rushed to render assistance, but before they reached him he had slipped,  and rolled down the awful slope which ended in a sheer perpendicular  precipice.  Here he bounded off into space, and next moment fell,  baggage and all, with a tremendous splash into the river.    It seemed impossible that the poor animal could have escaped with life,  but in another moment his head reappeared above water, and he made a  brave struggle to gain the bank.  The current, however, was too strong  for him.  Down he went below the foaming water, his scraggy tail making  a farewell flourish as he disappeared.  But again his head appeared, and  once again he struggled for the bank.  This time with success, for he  had been swept into a shallow in which he was able to maintain his  foothold and slowly drag himself out of the river.  When in safety, he  stood with drooping head and tail, as if in a state of the most thorough  dejection at having made such an exhibition of himself.    \"Clebber beast!\" shouted Quashy, who had stood with his ten fingers  expanded, his great mouth open, and his whole emotional soul glaring out  of his monstrous eyes.    \"Well done!\" echoed Lawrence, who was scarcely less pleased than his  servant.    The party now drew near, and very striking was their appearance--the  variously coloured mules, following the bell-mare which went in advance  as a leader, winding slowly down the crooked path, and the peons in  their picturesque costumes shouting, laughing, or singing wild snatches  of song as they were moved by fury, fun, or fancy.    The men, who numbered a dozen or so, and were well-armed, were  apparently relieved to find that our travellers were not bandits, in  regard to whom their questions showed that they felt some anxiety.  They  had witnessed Pedro's shot from the heights above, and looked upon him  with no little surprise and much respect as they commented on his power  with the rifle.    A few questions were asked, a few compliments paid, and then the two  parties, passing each other, proceeded on their respective ways.    Crossing the mountain torrent at a rather dangerous ford, towards  evening Pedro led his companions to a spot not far from the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],[0,"Battles with the Sea (#9)"],[1,"sea,  her progress is comparatively safe, simple tugging against wind and sea  being all that has to be done until the wreck is reached, where dangers  of another kind await her.    I have now shown that the great qualities of our lifeboat  are--_buoyancy_, or a tendency not to sink; _self-righting_ power, or  inability to remain upside down; _self-emptying_ power, or a capacity to  discharge any water that may get into it; and _stability_, or a tendency  not to upset.  The last quality I shall refer to, though by no means the  least, is _strength_.    From what has been already written about lifeboats being hurled against  wrecks and rocks, it must be evident that the strength of ordinary boats  would not suffice.    In order to give them the requisite strength of frame for their  tremendous warfare, they are built of the best Honduras mahogany, on  what is known as the diagonal plan--that is, the boat has two distinct  \"skins\" of planking, one set of planks being laid on in a diagonal  position to the others.  Moreover, these planks run from one gunwale  round under the boat to the other gunwale, and have a complete layer of  prepared canvas between them.  Thus great strength and elasticity are  combined, so that the boat can stand an inconceivable amount of  battering on wreckage, rocks, or sand, without being destroyed.    That this is really so I will endeavour to prove by referring in the  next chapter to a particular instance in which the great strength of one  of our lifeboats was powerfully illustrated.    It may be added, in conclusion, that the oars of a lifeboat are short,  and so made as to combine the greatest possible strength with lightness.  They are fastened to the gunwale by short pieces of rope, and work in a  moveable iron crutch on an iron thole-pin.  Each boat is provided with a  set of spare oars.  Her equipment of compass, cables, grapnels, anchors,  etcetera, is, as may be supposed, very complete, and she rides upon the  storm in a rather gay dress of red, white, and blue, in order that she  may be readily distinguished from other boats--her lower parts being  white, her upper sides blue, and her line of \"fender\" all round being  scarlet.        CHAPTER FIVE.    MORE TALES OF HEROISM.    If any one should doubt the fact that a lifeboat is _all but_  indestructible, let that sceptical one read the following tale of wreck  and rescue.    On a terrible night in the year 1857 a Portuguese brig struck on the  Goodwin Sands, not far from the lightship that marks the northern  extremity of those fatal shoals.  A shot was fired, and a rocket sent up  by the lightship.  No second signal was needed.  The Ramsgate men were,  as usual, keeping a bright lookout.  Instantly they jumped into the  lifeboat, which lay calmly floating in the harbour alongside the pier.  So eager were the men to engage in the deadly struggle that the boat was  over-manned, and the last two who jumped in were obliged to go ashore  again.    The tug _Aid_ was all ready--according to custom--with steam up.  She  took the boat in tow and made for the mouth of the harbour.  Staggering  out in the teeth of tide and tempest they ploughed their way through a  heavy cross sea, that swept again and again over them, until they  reached the edge of the Goodwins.  Here the steamer cast off the boat,  and waited for her while she dashed into the surf, and bore the brunt of  the battle alone.    It was a familiar proceeding to all concerned.  Many a time before had  the Ramsgate boat and steamer rescued men and women and little ones from  the jaws of death on the Goodwins, but they were about to experience a  few novelties that night.    It was very dark, so that the boat had much difficulty in finding the  brig.  On coming within about eighty yards of her they cast anchor and  veered down under her lee.  At first they were in hopes of getting the  vessel off, and some hours were spent in vain attempts to do this, but  the gale increased in fury; the brig began to break up.  She rolled from  side to side, and the yards swung wildly in the air.  A blow from one of  these yards would have stove the boat in, so the Portuguese crew--twelve  men and a boy--were taken from the wreck, and the lifeboat-men  endeavoured to push off.    All this time the boat had been floating in a basin worked in the sand  by the motion of the wreck; but the tide had been falling, and when they  tried to pull up to their anchor the boat struck heavily on the edge of  this basin.  They worked to get off the shoals with the energy of men  who believe that their lives depend on their efforts.  For a moment they  succeeded in getting afloat, but again struck and remained fast.    Meanwhile the brig was lifted by each wave, that came rushing over the  shoals like a mountain chain of snow, and let fall with a thundering  crash.  Her timbers began to snap like pipe-stems, and, as she worked  nearer and nearer to the boat, the wildly-swaying yards threatened  immediate destruction.  The heavy seas flew continually over the  lifeboat, so that passengers and crew could do nothing but hold on to  the thwarts for their lives.  At last the brig came so near that there  was a stir among the men; they were preparing for the last struggle--  some of them intending to leap into the rigging of the wreck and take  their chance.  But the coxswain shouted, \"Stick to the boat, boys, stick  to the boat!\" and the men obeyed.    At that moment the boat lifted a little on the surf and grounded again.  New hope was inspired by this.  They pulled at the cable and shoved  might and main with the oars.  They succeeded in getting out of  immediate danger, but still could not pull up to their anchor in the  teeth of wind and tide.  The coxswain then saw plainly that there was  but one resource left--to cut the cable and drive away to leeward right  across the Goodwin Sands, which at that place were two miles wide.  But  there was not yet sufficient water on the sands even for the attempting  of that forlorn hope.  As far as could be seen in that direction, ay,  and far beyond the power of vision, there was nothing but a chaos of  wild, tumultuous, whirling foam, without sufficient depth to float them  over, so they held on, intending to wait till the tide, which had  turned, should rise.  Very soon, however, the anchor began to drag.  This compelled them to hoist sail, cut the cable sooner than they had  intended, and attempt to beat to windward--off the sands.  It was in  vain.  A moment more, and they struck with tremendous force.  A breaker  came rolling towards them, filled the boat, caught her up like a  plaything on its crest, and, hurling her a few yards onwards, let her  fall with a shock that well-nigh tore every man out of her.  Each  successive breaker treated her in this way!    Those who dwell by the seashore know well those familiar ripples that  mark the sands when the tide is out.  On the Goodwins those ripples are  gigantic banks, to be measured by feet, not by inches.  I can speak from  personal experience, having once visited the Goodwins and walked among  the sand-banks at low water.  From one to another of these banks this  splendid boat was thrown.  Each roaring surf caught it by the bow or  stern, and, whirling it right round, sent it crashing on the next ledge.  The Portuguese sailors gave up all hope and clung to the thwarts in  silent despair, but the crew did not lose heart altogether.  They knew  the boat well, had often gone out to battle in her, and hoped that they  might yet be saved, if they could only escape striking on the pieces of  old wreck with which the sands were strewn.    Thus, literally, yard by yard, with a succession of shocks, that would  have knocked any ordinary boat to pieces, did that lifeboat drive,  during two hours, over two miles of the Goodwin Sands!    A thrilling and graphic account of this wreck and rescue is given in the  Reverend John Gilmore's book, \"Storm Warriors,\" in which he tells us  that while this exciting work was going on, the _Aid_ lay head to wind,  steaming half power, and holding her own against the storm, waiting for  her lifeboat, but no lifeboat returned to her, and her gallant captain  became more and more anxious as time flew by.  Could it be possible that  her sturdy little comrade, with whom she had gone out to battle in  hundreds of gales, was overcome at last and destroyed!  They signalled  again and again, but got no reply.  Then, as their fears increased, they  began to cruise about as near to the dangerous shoals as they dared--  almost playing with death--as they eagerly sought for their consort.  At  last the conviction was forced upon them that the boat must have been  stove by the wreck and swamped.  In the midst of their gathering despair  they caught sight of the lightship's bright beam, shining like a star of  hope through the surrounding darkness.  With a faint hope they made for  the vessel and hailed her.  \"Have you seen anything of the lifeboat?\"  was the eager question.  \"Nothing! nothing!\" was the sad reply.  Back  they went again to the place they had left, determined to cruise on,  hoping against hope, till the night should pass away.  Hour after hour  they steamed hither and thither, with anxiously straining eyes.  At last  grey dawn appeared and the wreck became dimly visible.  They made for  it, and their worst fears were realised--the remnant of the brig's hull  was there with ropes and wreckage tossing wildly round it--but no  lifeboat!    Sadly they turned away and continued to search for some time in the  faint hope that some of her crew might be floating about, buoyed up by  their lifebelts, but none were found, and at last they reluctantly made  for the harbour.    And when the harbour was gained what saw they there?  The lifeboat! safe  and sound, floating as calmly beside the pier as if nothing had  happened!  As the captain of the _Aid_ himself said, he felt inclined at"]]]
