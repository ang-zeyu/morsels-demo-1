[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#9)"],[1,"visitor one morning, heard through the open  door.    \"I wish to see the editor of this paper,\" said the visitor.    \"Editor not in,\" said Master Maloney, untruthfully.    \"Ha! Then when he returns I wish you to give him a message.\"    \"Sure.\"    \"I am Aubrey Bodkin, of the National Theatre. Give him my  compliments, and tell him that Mr. Bodkin does not lightly forget.\"    An unsolicited testimonial which caused Psmith the keenest  satisfaction.    The section of the paper devoted to Kid Brady was attractive to all  those with sporting blood in them. Each week there appeared in the  same place on the same page a portrait of the Kid, looking moody  and important, in an attitude of self-defence, and under the  portrait the legend, \"Jimmy Garvin must meet this boy.\" Jimmy was  the present holder of the light-weight title. He had won it a year  before, and since then had confined himself to smoking cigars as  long as walking-sticks and appearing nightly as the star in a  music-hall sketch entitled \"A Fight for Honour.\" His reminiscences  were appearing weekly in a Sunday paper. It was this that gave  Psmith the idea of publishing Kid Brady's autobiography in _Cosy  Moments_, an idea which made the Kid his devoted adherent from then  on. Like most pugilists, the Kid had a passion for bursting into  print, and his life had been saddened up to the present by the  refusal of the press to publish his reminiscences. To appear in  print is the fighter's accolade. It signifies that he has arrived.  Psmith extended the hospitality of page four of _Cosy Moments_ to Kid  Brady, and the latter leaped at the chance. He was grateful to  Psmith for not editing his contributions. Other pugilists,  contributing to other papers, groaned under the supervision of a  member of the staff who cut out their best passages and altered the  rest into Addisonian English. The readers of _Cosy Moments_ got Kid  Brady raw.    \"Comrade Brady,\" said Psmith to Billy, \"has a singularly pure and  pleasing style. It is bound to appeal powerfully to the  many-headed. Listen to this bit. Our hero is fighting Battling Jack  Benson in that eminent artist's native town of Louisville, and the  citizens have given their native son the Approving Hand, while  receiving Comrade Brady with chilly silence. Here is the Kid on the  subject: 'I looked around that house, and I seen I hadn't a friend  in it. And then the gong goes, and I says to myself how I has one  friend, my poor old mother way out in Wyoming, and I goes in and  mixes it, and then I seen Benson losing his goat, so I ups with an  awful half-scissor hook to the plexus, and in the next round I seen  Benson has a chunk of yellow, and I gets in with a hay-maker and I  picks up another sleep-producer from the floor and hands it him,  and he takes the count all right.' . . Crisp, lucid, and to the  point. That is what the public wants. If this does not bring  Comrade Garvin up to the scratch, nothing will.\"    But the feature of the paper was the \"Tenement\" series. It was late  summer now, and there was nothing much going on in New York. The  public was consequently free to take notice. The sale of _Cosy  Moments_ proceeded briskly. As Psmith had predicted, the change of  policy had the effect of improving the sales to a marked extent.  Letters of complaint from old subscribers poured into the office  daily. But, as Billy Windsor complacently remarked, they had paid  their subscriptions, so that the money was safe whether they read  the paper or not. And, meanwhile, a large new public had sprung up  and was growing every week. Advertisements came trooping in. _Cosy  Moments_, in short, was passing through an era of prosperity  undreamed of in its history.    \"Young blood,\" said Psmith nonchalantly, \"young blood. That is the  secret. A paper must keep up to date, or it falls behind its  competitors in the race. Comrade Wilberfloss's methods were  possibly sound, but too limited and archaic. They lacked ginger. We  of the younger generation have our fingers more firmly on the  public pulse. We read off the public's unspoken wishes as if by  intuition. We know the game from A to Z.\"    At this moment Master Maloney entered, bearing in his hand a card.    \"'Francis Parker'?\" said Billy, taking it. \"Don't know him.\"    \"Nor I,\" said Psmith. \"We make new friends daily.\"    \"He's a guy with a tall-shaped hat,\" volunteered Master Maloney,  \"an' he's wearin' a dude suit an' shiny shoes.\"    \"Comrade Parker,\" said Psmith approvingly, \"has evidently not been  blind to the importance of a visit to _Cosy Moments_. He has dressed  himself in his best. He has felt, rightly, that this is no occasion  for the old straw hat and the baggy flannels. I would not have it  otherwise. It is the right spirit. Shall we give him audience,  Comrade Windsor?\"    \"I wonder what he wants.\"    \"That,\" said Psmith, \"we shall ascertain more clearly after a  personal interview. Comrade Maloney, show the gentleman in. We can  give him three and a quarter minutes.\"    Pugsy withdrew.    Mr. Francis Parker proved to be a man who might have been any age  between twenty-five and thirty-five. He had a smooth, clean-shaven  face, and a cat-like way of moving. As Pugsy had stated in effect,  he wore a tail-coat, trousers with a crease which brought a smile  of kindly approval to Psmith's face, and patent-leather boots of  pronounced shininess. Gloves and a tall hat, which he carried,  completed an impressive picture.    He moved softly into the room.    \"I wished to see the editor.\"    Psmith waved a hand towards Billy.    \"The treat has not been denied you,\" he said. \"Before you is  Comrade Windsor, the Wyoming cracker-jack. He is our editor. I  myself--I am Psmith--though but a subordinate, may also claim the  title in a measure. Technically, I am but a sub-editor; but such is  the mutual esteem in which Comrade Windsor and I hold each other  that we may practically be said to be inseparable. We have no  secrets from each other. You may address us both impartially. Will  you sit for a space?\"    He pushed a chair towards the visitor, who seated himself with the  care inspired by a perfect trouser-crease. There was a momentary  silence while he selected a spot on the table on which to place his  hat.    \"The style of the paper has changed greatly, has it not, during the  past few weeks?\" he said. \"I have never been, shall I say, a  constant reader of _Cosy Moments_, and I may be wrong. But is not its  interest in current affairs a recent development?\"    \"You are very right,\" responded Psmith. \"Comrade Windsor, a man of  alert and restless temperament, felt that a change was essential if  _Cosy Moments_ was to lead public thought. Comrade Wilberfloss's  methods were good in their way. I have no quarrel with Comrade  Wilberfloss. But he did not lead public thought. He catered  exclusively for children with water on the brain, and men and women  with solid ivory skulls. Comrade Windsor, with a broader view,  feels that there are other and larger publics. He refuses to  content himself with ladling out a weekly dole of mental  predigested breakfast food. He provides meat. He--\"    \"Then--excuse me--\" said Mr. Parker, turning to Billy, \"You, I take  it, are responsible for this very vigorous attack on the  tenement-house owners?\"    \"You can take it I am,\" said Billy.    Psmith interposed.    \"We are both responsible, Comrade Parker. If any husky guy, as I  fancy Master Maloney would phrase it, is anxious to aim a swift  kick at the man behind those articles, he must distribute it evenly  between Comrade Windsor and myself.\"    \"I see.\" Mr. Parker paused. \"They are--er--very outspoken  articles,\" he added.    \"Warm stuff,\" agreed Psmith. \"Distinctly warm stuff.\"    \"May I speak frankly?\" said Mr. Parker.    \"Assuredly, Comrade Parker. There must be no secrets, no restraint  between us. We would not have you go away and say to yourself, 'Did  I make my meaning clear? Was I too elusive?' Say on.\"    \"I am speaking in your best interests.\"    \"Who would doubt it, Comrade Parker. Nothing has buoyed us up more  strongly during the hours of doubt through which we have passed  than the knowledge that you wish us well.\"    Billy Windsor suddenly became militant. There was a feline  smoothness about the visitor which had been jarring upon him ever  since he first spoke. Billy was of the plains, the home of blunt  speech, where you looked your man in the eye and said it quick. Mr.  Parker was too bland for human consumption. He offended Billy's  honest soul.    \"See here,\" cried he, leaning forward, \"what's it all about? Let's  have it. If you've anything to say about those articles, say it  right out. Never mind our best interests. We can look after them.  Let's have what's worrying you.\"    Psmith waved a deprecating hand.    \"Do not let us be abrupt on this happy occasion. To me it is  enough simply to sit and chat with Comrade Parker, irrespective of  the trend of his conversation. Still, as time is money, and this is  our busy day, possibly it might be as well, sir, if you unburdened  yourself as soon as convenient. Have you come to point out some  flaw in those articles? Do they fall short in any way of your  standard for such work?\"    Mr. Parker's smooth face did not change its expression, but he came  to the point.    \"I should not go on with them if I were you,\" he said.    \"Why?\" demanded Billy.    \"There are reasons why you should not,\" said Mr. Parker.    \"And there are reasons why we should.\"    \"Less powerful ones.\"    There proceeded from Billy a noise not describable in words. It was  partly a snort, partly a growl. It resembled more than anything  else the preliminary sniffing snarl a bull-dog emits before he  joins battle. Billy's cow-boy blood was up. He was rapidly  approaching the state of mind in which the men of the plains,  finding speech unequal to the expression of their thoughts, reach  for their guns.    Psmith intervened.

W, 3 mi. S Acebuches), May  13, 1954, weight, 108 gms.; and [Male] 31651 and [Female] 31652 from  the north foot of Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S, 5 mi. W General Cepeda),  6500 ft., April 21, 1953.    In suitable habitats in Coahuila the Red-shafted Flicker is common.  Miller (1955a:165-166) stated that _C. c. nanus_ was common at Corte  Madera Canyon, Boquillas Canyon, and Carboneras Canyon in the Sierra  del Carmen and recorded a specimen also from Sierra de Jardin on August  7. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:192) recorded _C. c. nanus_ from Diamante  Pass and Saltillo. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:31) stated that the  Red-shafted Flickers, obtained 5 mi. E La Rosa and at Diamante Pass,  may be intermediate between _C. c. collaris_ (then called _C. c.  chihuahuae_) and _C. c. nanus_. Nesting of the Red-shafted Flicker in  Coahuila was reported by Miller (1955a:165) and Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:192). Hardy saw Red-shafted Flickers 13 mi. E San Antonio de las  Alazanas on July 6, 1955.    *_Centurus aurifrons aurifrons_ (Wagler).--_Specimens examined:_ total  6: [Male] 32054 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 19,  1952; [Female] [Female] 32055-32057 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June  20, 1952; [Female] 31039 from 8 mi. N, 4 mi. W Muzquiz, 1800 ft., April  1, 1952; and [Male] 33150 (skeleton only) from Parras, July 4, 1955.    The Golden-fronted Woodpecker occurs throughout Coahuila, but  uncommonly in the western part. Wetmore (1948:185-186) examined a  series of Golden-fronted Woodpeckers that showed a definite cline in  dorsal coloration from north-central Texas to Jalisco, Michoacan, and  Hidalgo in south-central Mexico. He (_loc. cit._) stated that \"the  extremes are easily separable, but in southern and southwestern Texas  and in northeastern Mexico the two kinds [_C. a. aurifrons_ and _C. a.  incanescens_] ... merge so gradually that over a broad area the whole  population is intermediate, making decisions as to any sharply drawn  dividing line difficult and in part arbitrary.\" _C. a. incanescens_,  according to Wetmore, occurs in western and central Texas south to  northeastern Chihuahua and northern Coahuila whereas _C. a. aurifrons_  occurs in north-central Coahuila (Monclova) and southern Texas south to  Jalisco, Michoacan, Hidalgo, and central Tamaulipas.    The specimens that I have examined from Coahuila are variably  intermediate between the subspecies _aurifrons_ and _incanescens_. The  dark and white cross-bars on the back of No. 31039 are nearly equal  (dark bands wider in _aurifrons_; white bands wider in _incanescens_);  the rump and upper tail coverts are more or less mixed with black as in  _aurifrons_. The dark cross-bars on the backs of Nos. 32054-32057 are  slightly larger than the white cross-bars; the rump and upper tail  coverts of these specimens are somewhat mixed with black.    *_Centurus aurifrons incanescens_ Todd.--This subspecies of the  Golden-fronted Woodpecker is listed by Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1957:34) from \"... northern Coahuila (upper Rio Grande valley).\"  Burleigh and Lowery (1942:192) stated that the Golden-fronted  Woodpecker \"apparently avoids the mountain slopes, but was found to be  not uncommon on the arid plateau about Saltillo.\" Findley saw  Golden-fronted Woodpeckers 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 feet, on June 19, 1952;  and 2 mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on June 22, 1952. Cory  (1919:424) listed the Golden-fronted Woodpecker from Sabinas. Nos.  32055-32057 are juveniles, and thus document breeding by this  woodpecker in Coahuila.    *_Melanerpes formicivorus formicivorus_ (Swainson).--_Specimens  examined:_ total 5: [Male] 31040 (skeleton only) from Fortin (=33 mi.  N, 8 mi. W San Geronimo), 3300 ft., March 28, 1952; [Male] 29423 and  [Female] 29424 from Club Sierra del Carmen (=2 mi. N, 6 mi. W Piedra  Blanca), 4950 ft., April 8, 1950; [Female] 31041 (skeleton only) from  26 mi. W Santa Teresa, 7050 ft., April 5, 1952; and [Female] 31668 from  Sierra Guadalupe, Canyon d. Meco (=10 mi. S General Cepeda), 6500 ft.,  April 23, 1953.    The Acorn Woodpecker in Coahuila is common in the oak and pine-oak  belts, from 4950 to 8000 feet. Miller (1955a:166) stated that the Acorn  Woodpecker in the Sierra del Carmen was an abundant and conspicuous  bird throughout the oak and pine-oak belts, from 5000 to 8000 feet.  Dickerman saw two Acorn Woodpeckers in the Sierra de la Madera on  December 13, 1953, and four 20 mi. S Ocampo, 6000 feet, on April 4,  1954. Breeding of _M. f. formicivorus_ was reported by Miller (_loc.  cit._) who took females nearly ready to begin laying; one of our  specimens (No. 29423) had enlarged testes (11 mm.).    _Sphyrapicus varius varius_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Female] 31649, from the north foot of Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S, 5  mi. W General Cepeda), 6400 ft., April 19, 1953.    Miller (1955a:166) reported this Yellow-bellied Sapsucker as a winter  visitant or migrant in the Sierra del Carmen. Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:192) took a female _S. v. varius_ at the summit of Diamante Pass  on April 14. Ridgway (1914:275) listed _S. v. varius_ from Sierra de  Guadalupe.    _Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis_ Baird.--Miller (1955a:166) reported this  Yellow-bellied Sapsucker as \"indeed common\" in the Sierra del Carmen,  and indicated that both _S. v. nuchalis_ and _S. v. varius_ were \"found  only at the upper levels in the pine-oak formation and usually in  relatively dense clumps of trees in the canyon bottoms.\" Ridgway  (1914:280) listed _C. v. nuchalis_ from Rio Sabinas.    **_Dendrocopos villosus icastus_ (Oberholser).--Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:39) remarked that this subspecies of the Hairy  Woodpecker occurs, in northwestern Mexico, from eastern Sonora,  Jalisco, Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas to southern Coahuila. Ridgway  (1914:222) stated that _D. v. icastus_ occurs in Coahuila at Carneros  and Sierra de Guadalupe, the former being the easternmost known  locality for the subspecies.    **_Dendrocopos villosus intermedius_ (Nelson).--_Specimens examined:_  total 2: [Male] 32701 from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, 9950  ft., July 6, 1955; and [Female] 31604 from 2 mi. E Mesa de Tablas, 8500  ft., January 15, 1954.    In northeastern Mexico this subspecies, according to Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:39), occurs in Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi,  Hidalgo, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Nos. 31604 and 32701 represent the  first records of _D. v. intermedius_ from Coahuila.    *_Dendrocopos scalaris cactophilus_ (Oberholser).--_Specimens  examined:_ total 2: [Female] 31042 from 7 mi. S, 2 mi. E Boquillas, 800  ft., March 1, 1952; and [Female] 31043 from 10 mi. S, 5 mi. E  Boquillas, 1500 ft., March 3, 1952.    These specimens of the Ladder-backed Woodpecker show signs of  intergradation with _D. s. symplectus_. Both specimens are pale enough  above for _D. s. symplectus_, but the wing and the tail of each (wing,  102, 103 mm.; tail, 60, 65 mm.) are too long for _symplectus_. This  suggestion of intergradation is not unexpected because _symplectus_  occurs in northeastern Coahuila and _cactophilus_ in the Chisos  Mountains of Texas. Miller (1955a:166) also obtained one female _D. s.  cactophilus_ from the Sierra del Carmen that suggested intergradation  with _symplectus_.    Miller (_loc. cit._) wrote that _D. c. cactophilus_ was found chiefly  in the oaks and was common in the lower oak belt at 5000 feet. The  upper limit of the range of the Ladder-backed Woodpecker, according to  Miller, is 6800 feet. He reported the species as breeding in the Sierra  del Carmen.    Miller (1955b:317) took a hybrid woodpecker representing a cross  between _Dendrocopos villosus_ and _Dendrocopos scalaris_ in the Sierra  del Carmen, where, although Ladder-backed Woodpeckers were common, he  found no Hairy Woodpeckers.    **_Dendrocopos scalaris symplectus_ (Oberholser).--_Specimens  examined:_ total 2: [Male] 32058 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, June 20, 1952;  and [Male] 31667 from Sierra Guadalupe, Domingo Canyon (=10 mi. S, 14  mi. W General Cepeda), 6700 ft., April 18, 1953.    This Ladder-backed Woodpecker, according to the AOU Check-list  Committee (1957:327) and Oberholser (1912:156), occurs in Texas (east  of Pecos), northeastern Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. The area  of intergradation of _D. s. symplectus_ and _giraudi_ is in  southeastern Coahuila. The dark smoky underparts and the equal size of  the white and black bars of the upper parts of No. 31667 suggest  intergradation with _D. s. giraudi_. Yet, the size of the wing  indicates that this specimen is closer to _D. s. symplectus_. No. 32058  has characters of typical representatives of _D. s. symplectus_.  Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193) reported _D. s. symplectus_ \"in the  desert country west of Saltillo.\" Ridgway (1914:257) listed the  Ladder-backed Woodpecker from Sabinas. Cory (1919:494) listed _D. s.  symplectus_ from Pabinas (=Sabinas?).    **_Dendrocopos scalaris giraudi_ (Stone).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 34623, from 12 mi. N, 10 mi. E Parras, 3850 ft., July 12, 1953,  weight, 35 gms.    Ridgway (1914:259) reported that _D. s. giraudi_ (then called  _Dryobates scalaris bairdi_) has been recorded from La Ventura,  Carneros, and Jaral. Oberholser (1912:159) indicated that the  subspecies _giraudi_ occurs north to Jaral in southern Coahuila, east  to La Ventura in southeastern Coahuila, and south through central  Mexico. The present specimen is darker ventrally than specimens of  either _D. s. cactophilus_ or _D. s. symplectus_, and on its upper  surface"]]]
