The discontent of the people, the inevitable result of the injuries  inflicted on the feelings and interests of individuals[13], was  increased by the open infringement of the rights of the people,  although these rights were secured to the country by a compact which  seemed to be inviolable.                       [Footnote 13: There are times when a government may                     attack general principles without danger. But men                     and their personal interests can never be assailed                     with impunity. Personal interest is the prime mover                     of public opinion and feeling; and however                     degrading the truth may appear, it is not to be                     disputed. After a great national catastrophe this                     baleful egotism is particularly evident. Dignified                     passions become extinct for want of fuel; and the                     human mind, destitute of external occupation, works                     inward upon itself, and begets selfishness, the                     true pestilence of the soul. When this disease                     affects a nation, the government is lost if it                     attacks the interests of individuals.]    Liberty of conscience had been promised by the charter, and this  liberty was immediately annihilated. An ordonnance was issued by the  police[14], which revived regulations enacted in _an age of  intolerance_, for enforcing the strict and universal observance of the  Lord's day, and the festivals of the church. Napoleon, anxious to  preserve a strict neutrality between the catholics and the  protestants, prohibited the religious processions of the former in all  towns containing places of worship belonging to the latter communion.  His prohibition was removed, and the catholic priesthood exulted in  their processions, in which they marched in triumph. They ought to  have tranquillized the apprehensions of their opponents, and to have  edified the faithful by humility, or at least by feigning humility;  but they disdained to conciliate the public, whom they scandalized by  their pride and irritated by their violence[15].                       [Footnote 14: By means of ordonnances the ministers                     legislated according to their pleasure in matters                     which ought only to have been regulated by the law,                     so that the greater part of the bills presented to                     the chambers \"had been already enacted and executed                     in the shape of ordonnances; and the legislature                     had no other function except that of giving a legal                     sanction to the arbitrary decrees of the                     ministers.\"--_Censeur._]                       [Footnote 15: Even in Paris several persons were                     ill treated and bayoneted, because they refused to                     pull off their hats and kneel, whilst the                     processions were passing by.]    The imagination of the priests became fired by the victory which they  supposed they had gained. They dreamt that they were in full  possession of their ancient power; and they wished immediately to  revive it according to their ancient fashion. An actress belonging to  the Theatre Francais died without being absolved, and without  suspecting that it was necessary to be absolved, from the  excommunication which had been formerly fulminated against stage  players; and which, as every body knows, deprived Moliere of Christian  burial.    Following the same precedents, the clergy would not allow the rites of  sepulture to the actress in question. The populace, who followed the  funeral out of curiosity, learnt the affront which was thus offered to  her remains. Transported by sudden indignation, they rushed to the  hearse, and dragged it onwards. The doors of the interdicted church  were burst open in a moment. They called for a priest; no priest  appeared. The tumult augmented. The church and the neighbouring  streets resounded with the groans and threats of ten thousand persons.  Their agitation became more violent, and there was no possibility of  foreseeing where the effervescence of popular feeling would stop, when  a messenger arrived from the court, who ordered, in the name of the  King, that the funeral should proceed.    The accounts of this event, and the comments to which it gave rise,  excited the most lively interest in Paris and throughout France: nor  did it fail to give the greatest pleasure to the enemies of religion.  The friends of public decency and good order accused the government of  encouraging the alarming progress of sacerdotal despotism. It was  particularly in the smaller towns, and in the country, that the  priests behaved with the most blamable audacity, abusing the privilege  of speech which had been restored to them[16]. The pulpit became a  tribunal from whence they pronounced sentence of present infamy, with  the reversion of eternal damnation, upon all who refused to  participate in their opinions and bigotry. Making common cause with  the emigrants, they employed hints, inuendoes, insinuations,  arguments, promises, and threats of every species, for the purpose of  compelling the owners of the national property to yield up their  lands, and of leading the wretched peasantry again beneath the tyrant  yokes of feudality and superstition.                       [Footnote 16: Under the reign of Napoleon, if a                     priest had ventured to utter any opinion contrary                     to the system of government, he would have been                     immediately removed.]    During the revolution, the priesthood had betrayed its real character.  Contempt had fallen on the clergy, and it was out of the power of the  government to invest them suddenly with the salutary influence which  they had lost. This influence ought to be gained by wise and prudent  conduct, by active and impartial benevolence, by the practice of  sacerdotal virtues. It cannot be gained by ordonnances of police, by  abuse, by violence, by mumming processions, which, in our times, are  out of character and ridiculous.    By the charter the liberty of the press had been guarantied as well as  the liberty of public worship; yet every day innumerable publications  were seized or suppressed contrary to the laws. M. Durbach, a deputy  who never equivocated with his conscience or yielded to danger,  complained on this subject in the chamber: the opinion of the house  went along with him; and the government, pretending to yield to the  feeling of the deputies, presented a bill to the chambers through the  medium of M. de Montesquiou, which, instead of delivering the press  from its slavery, gave full establishment to the censorship, and  legalized the tyranny which had been exercised over the press by mere  force under the former government.    Benjamin Constant attacked the bill with vigour: the same side was  taken by the public journals, and by all public writers; but there was  no possibility of putting M. de Montesquiou out of countenance. It was  demonstrated to him that his law would wholly destroy the liberty of  the press. By holding the charter before his eyes, the advocates of  public rights proved that the charter only declared that the licence  of the press was to be restrained, and that his bill was therefore  radically unconstitutional, because the preliminary censorship was not  intended to restrain abuses, but to prevent their taking place.  Montesquiou answered gravely, that the persons with whom such  objections originated did not understand French; that the words  \"_prevenir_\" and \"_reprimer_\" were perfectly synonymous: and that the  bill, instead of being offensive or unconstitutional, contained a most  complete and a most liberal development of the clause in the charter.    This unparalleled endeavour of Montesquiou, who persuaded himself that  he could convince an assembly of Frenchmen that they did not  understand their own language, was justly considered by the chamber as  a matchless specimen of impudence and folly. Lexicographical  subtleties were employed with bitter mockery for the purpose of  destroying a public right, consecrated by the constitutional compact.  Never had insolence and bad faith been displayed so prominently:  Raynouard, the reporter of the committee, exclaimed in the language of  grief and indignation, \"Minister of our King, confess, at least, that  your law is contrary to the constitution, since you cannot refute the  evidence adduced against it: your obstinacy in contesting such an  indisputable truth would not then inspire us with such just alarms.\"    The law was ultimately adopted by both chambers; ministerial influence  triumphed over reason, and rased the most important bulwark of the  rights guarantied to the nation. The result of the conflict produced  the most lively sensation. No man who was capable of forethought and  reasoning could remain undisturbed. Notwithstanding the patriotism of  Dupont (of the department of the Eure), of Raynouard, of Durbach, of  Bedoch, of Flaugergues, it was seen too clearly that the chamber of  deputies could not oppose any effectual obstacle to the despotic and  anti-constitutional plans of the government; and that the ministers  would have full power, whenever they thought proper, to interpret the  clauses of the charter according to their own way, and to rob the  French nation of the few rights which it yet might promise to them.  \"By means of such interpretations,\" the people said, \"the senate  sacrificed the independence of the nation to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22352"],[0,"American Boy's Life of Theodore Roosevelt (#9)"],[1," not struck  and lost no time in disappearing.    \"Never mind; one isn't so bad,\" said Theodore Roosevelt, and his  companion agreed with him.    The hunters now decided to go forward into the hollow and look for the  doe Theodore Roosevelt had missed. This was done, and soon the foreman  pointed to some drops and splashes of blood.    \"Must have hit her, after all,\" said the foreman. \"We can take our time  about following her up. We'll be sure to get her sooner or later.\"    But locating the wounded doe proved not so easy, after all. The trail  was followed for some time, but was lost on the hard ground higher up;  and at last the two hunters agreed to look for new game. They had lunch,  and then started out nearly as fresh as before when suddenly the foreman  called out:--    \"There's your game all right!\"    He pointed to a clump of bushes, and running forward, both saw the doe  stretched out, stiff and cold. She had been mortally wounded, after all,  much to both hunters' gratification.    So far the hunting had been on foot, but now the hunters took again to  their steeds. Mr. Roosevelt says he was wishing for just one more shot,  to see if he could not do better than before, when his wish was  gratified. Just ahead a yearling black-tail buck leaped into view and  cantered away. After the buck went both hunters, but Theodore Roosevelt  was in the lead, and this time determined to make no miss or poor shot.  He waited until the buck turned its side to him, then fired with  especial care. The game staggered on, then fell. The bullet had gone  clean through its body, and in a few seconds it breathed its last.          CHAPTER VII    RUNS FOR MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY--MARRIAGE TO EDITH KERMIT CAREW--HUNTING  IN THE BIGHORN MOUNTAINS--A WILD CHASE AFTER THREE ELK      Although Theodore Roosevelt was devoting himself to ranching, hunting,  and literary work in North Dakota he had by no means given up his  residence in New York or at Oyster Bay. More than this, he still  continued his connection with the Republican party in spite of the  set-back at the last National Convention.    In 1886, while Grover Cleveland was still President of the United  States, there was an exceedingly sharp and bitter fight in New York City  over the office of mayor. There was great discontent both in the  Republican and the Democratic party, and nobody could tell what was  going to happen on election day.    \"Let us put up Teddy Roosevelt,\" said some of the Republicans, and  shortly after this Theodore Roosevelt was nominated for mayor of New  York. His regular opponent was Abram Hewitt, while the Independents put  up Henry George, the \"single tax\" man, well known as the author of a  book entitled \"Progress and Poverty.\"    From the very start the campaign was an exceedingly hot one, and there  was a good deal of parading and speech-making. Many clubs were organized  in behalf of Theodore Roosevelt, and clubs were likewise formed to  support the other candidates. The supporters of Henry George came from  both regular parties, so political matters became very much mixed up.    \"There is no show for Roosevelt unless George withdraws,\" said more than  one old politician.    \"And George won't withdraw,\" added others. And so it proved. Henry  George was exceptionally strong with the poorer classes, and on election  day he polled over 68,000 votes; 90,552 votes were cast for Hewitt,  while Roosevelt received 60,435 votes.    It was certainly a disheartening defeat, and many a man would have  retired from the political field, never to show himself again. But  Theodore Roosevelt was made of sterner stuff. He held his ground and  went his way as before, resolved to do his duty as it should present  itself.    It was about this time that his intimacy with Miss Edith Kermit Carew  was renewed. It will be remembered that she had been his playmate during  his earlier days around Union Square. In the years that had followed she  had been graduated from a young ladies' seminary and had travelled  abroad, visiting London, Paris, and other large cities. Now she was home  again, and on December 2, 1886, she became Mr. Roosevelt's wife.    Mr. Roosevelt's second marriage has been a very happy one. Mrs.  Roosevelt is a loving wife and a gracious mistress of the White House.  Five children have come to bless their union, of which more will be said  later. Mrs. Roosevelt at once took Mr. Roosevelt's daughter Alice to her  heart, and from that time to this the two have been as mother and  daughter.    Theodore Roosevelt had already produced his \"Naval War of 1812\" and his  \"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman,\" both spoken of in previous pages. A  short while after he was married the second time he brought out a \"Life  of Thomas Benton,\" and a year later a \"Life of Gouverneur Morris.\" In  addition to this he wrote a number of articles for the magazines, and  also some short stories for young folks. All were well received and  added not a little to his literary reputation.    But the desire to be out in the open, to roam the prairie and to hunt,  was in his veins, and again and again he visited his ranches in the Bad  Lands, and took hunting trips in other directions. Sometimes he cared  little or nothing for the game brought down, and at others he went on  the hunt with great deliberation, for \"something worth while,\" as he  expressed it.    How careful he could be on the latter occasions is shown by his printed  views on hunting, in which he discusses the best rifles, shot-guns, and  pistols to use, the best knives to carry, how to dress with comfort, and  how to follow up game, on horseback and on foot, in the open and when in  the woods or in the short brush. He has also told us much about the  habits of the beasts and birds that he has hunted, showing that he  followed the sport intelligently and not in the haphazard fashion of  many who go out merely to get a big bagful of game.    [Illustration: Edith Kermit Roosevelt]    Hunting was not all fun in those days. We have already related how  Theodore Roosevelt was caught in a heavy hailstorm. At another time he  and his companions were caught in a three-days' rain-storm, during which  the wind blew a hurricane. They were miles away from the ranch home, and  it was utterly impossible to move in any direction.    \"Reckon we are booked to stay here,\" said one of the cowboys, a fellow  from the South. \"It's a right smart storm, and it's going to stay by  us.\" And stay by them it did, until the party were almost out of  provisions. They got what shelter they could in something of a hollow  overhung with trees and brush, but this was not very satisfactory, and  all were soaked to the skin, and the blankets in which they rolled  themselves at night were both wet and muddy.    \"Teddy Roosevelt didn't like that wetting, and I know it,\" one of the  cowboys has said since. \"But he didn't grumble near as much as some of  the others. We had to take our medicine, and he took his like a man.\"    There were no elk in the immediate vicinity of Theodore Roosevelt's  ranches, nor were there many bears or buffaloes. But all of these  animals were to be met with further westward, and the young ranchman had  been after them during a previous year's hunting while on a trip to  Montana and Wyoming.    At that time the destination of the party was the Bighorn Mountains,  which were reached only after a painful and disheartening journey over a  very uncertain Indian trail, during which one of the ponies fell into a  washout and broke his neck, and a mule stuck fast in a mud-hole and was  extricated only after hours of hard work.    \"It was on the second day of our journey into the mountains that I got  my first sight of elk,\" says Mr. Roosevelt. The party was on the trail  leading into a broad valley, moving slowly and cautiously along through  a patch of pine trees. When the bottom of the valley was gained, Mr.  Roosevelt saw a herd of cow elk at a great distance, and soon after  took a shot at one, but failed to reach his mark.    \"I'm going after that herd,\" he said. And as soon as the party had  pitched camp, he sallied forth in one direction, while his foreman,  Merrifield, took another.    As Theodore Roosevelt had supposed, the elk had gone off in a bunch, and  for some distance it was easy to follow them. But further on the herd  had spread out, and he had to follow with more care, for fear of getting  on the wrong trail, for elk tracks ran in all directions over the  mountains. These tracks are there to-day, but the elk and the bears are  fast disappearing, for ruthless hunters have done their best to  exterminate the game.    After passing along for several miles, Theodore Roosevelt felt he must  be drawing close to the herd. Just then his rifle happened to tap on the  trunk of a tree, and instantly he heard the elk moving away in new  alarm. His hunting blood was now aroused, and he rushed forward with all  speed, but as silently as possible. By taking a short cut, the young  ranchman managed to come up beside the running elk. They were less than  twenty yards away, and had it not been for the many trees which were on  every side, he would have had an excellent shot at them. As it was he  brought low a fine, full-grown cow elk, and hit a bull calf in the hind  leg. Later on he took up the trail of the calf and finished that also.    Of this herd the foreman also brought down two, so that for the time  being the hunters had all the meat they needed. But Theodore Roosevelt  was anxious to obtain some elk horns as trophies of the chase, and day  after day a watch was kept for bull elk, as the hunters moved the camp  from one place to another.    At last the long-looked-for opportunity arrived. Three big bulls were  seen, and Roosevelt and his man went after them with all possible speed.  They were on foot, and the trail led them over some soft ground, and  then through a big patch of burnt timber. Here running was by no means"]]]
