The bench can be made  from any of the furniture woods, but the case may demand one made from  mahogany. If so, this wood can be purchased from a piano factory. The  following stock list of materials may be ordered from a mill, planed and  sandpapered:      1 top, 1 by 16 by 36-1/2 in.    2 ends, 1 by 14 by 18 in.    1 stretcher, 1 by 4 by 31-1/2 in.    2 side rails, 7/8 by 4 by 29-1/2 in.    2 keys, 1 by 1 by 3-1/2 in.    6 cleats, 1 by 1 by 4 in.    The dimensions given, with the exception of the keys and cleats, are 1/2  in. longer than necessary for squaring up the ends.    The two rails are cut slanting from a point 1-1/2 in. from each end to  the center, making them only 3 in. wide in the middle. The rails are  \"let into\" the edges of the ends so the outside of the rails and end  boards will be flush. The joints are put together with glue and screws.  The cleats are fastened with screws to the inside of the rails and to  the top. The stretcher has a tenon cut on each end which fits into a  mortise cut in each end. The tenons will have sufficient length to cut  the small mortise for the key.    [Illustration]    The kind of wood used will determine the color of the stain for the  finish. This also depends on matching other pieces of furniture.          HOW TO MAKE A MISSION SHAVING STAND      This attractive and useful piece of mission furniture will be  appreciated by the person that does his own shaving. The shaving stand  can be made at home by a handy man in his spare time as the stock can be  ordered from a mill ready for making the joints and attaching the few  pieces of hardware. The following is a stock list of materials:      4 posts 1-1/2 in. square by 50-1/2 in.    4 slats 7/8 by 1 by 32-1/2 in.    2 cross rails 1 by 1-1/2 by 15 in.    2 end rails 1 by 1-1/2 by 13 in.    1 top 7/8 by 16-1/2 by 19-1/2 in.    1 bottom 7/8 by 15 by 17 in.    2 ends 7/8 by 12-1/2 in. square.    1 back 7/8 by 12-1/2 by 14-1/2 in.    1 door 7/8 by 6-1/2 by 12-1/2 in.    2 drawer ends 7/8 by 5-1/2 by 7-1/2 in.    1 partition 7/8 by 12 by 14 in.    1 partition 7/8 by 7 by 14 in.    7 pieces of soft wood 1/2 by 7-1/2 by 12 in.    2 posts 1 in. square by 10-1/2 in.    1 bottom piece 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 18-1/2 in.    4 mirror frame pieces 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 14-1/2 in.    2 sticks for pins.    2 hinges    1 lock    2 drawer pulls    1 beveled glass mirror 11-1/2 by 11-1/2 in.    While this piece of furniture can be made in any kind of wood, the  novice will find that quarter-sawed oak will work up and finish better  than the other woods. The stock list given has dimensions 1/2 in. larger  in some instances for dressing and squaring where necessary.    [Illustration]    The tenons and mortises are first cut for the crosspieces at the bottom  of the posts, and, as it is best to use dowels at the top, holes are  bored in the bottom piece and also the ends of the slats for pins. The  bottom piece is also fastened to the posts with dowels. The bottom must  have a square piece cut out from each corner almost the same size as the  posts. When setting the sides together the end board and posts can be  doweled and glued together and after drying well the posts can be  spread apart far enough to insert the bottom rail and two slats. The  rail and slats should be tried for a bit before putting on any glue,  which may save some trouble.    [Illustration: Shaving Stand Complete]    After the sides are put together, the back is put in and glued. The top  is then put on and fastened with cleats from the inside. The partitions  are put in as shown and the door fitted. Two drawers are made from the  ends and the soft wood material. The drawer ends may be supplied with  wood pulls of the same material or matched with metal the same as used  for the hinges.    [Illustration: Mirror Frame and Standards Details]    The pieces for the mirror frame must be rabbeted 1/2 in. deep to take  the glass, and the ends joined together with a miter at each corner. The  two short posts are tenoned and mortises cut in the bottom piece for  joints and these joints well glued together. The bottom piece is then  fastened to the top board of the stand. This will form the standards in  which to swing the mirror and its frame. This is done with two pins  inserted in holes bored through the standards and into the mirror frame.    After the parts are all put together, cleaned and sandpapered, the stand  is ready for the finish.          A MISSION WASTE-PAPER BASKET      [Illustration: Waste-Paper Basket to Match Library Table]    The basket shown in the accompanying sketch is designed to be used with  a library table having slats in the ends and wooden handles on the  drawers. The finish is made to match that of the table by fuming, when  completely assembled, in a large-size size, clean garbage can, with  fumes of concentrated ammonia.    [Illustration: Detail of Waste-Paper Basket]    The following quarter-sawed white-oak stock should be procured in the  exact dimensions given. This may be had, planed and cut to lengths, from  a mill for a slight extra charge. It is advisable not to have them  sandpapered, as the very coarse sandpaper generally used, gives a bad  surface for finishing.       4 posts, 1-1/4 by 1-1/4 by 16-1/2 in., S-4-S.     4 rails, 3/4 by 3 by 10-1/4 in., S-2-S.     4 rails, 3/4 by 2 by 10-1/4 in., S-2-S.    12 slats, 3/8 by 2-1/4 by 9-1/2 in., S-2-S.     4 handle pieces, 1 by 1 by 2-1/2 in., S-4-S.     2 handle pieces, 1/2 by 1/2 by 6 in., S-4-S.     1 bottom, 3/8 by 9-1/2 by 9-1/2 in., S-2-S.    See that the posts are absolutely square cross section. Mark with a  pencil--not gauge--the chamfers on the ends of the posts and plane them  off.    Carefully mark the tenons on the ends of all the rails with a knife and  gauge lines. Be sure that the distance from the tenon shoulder at one  end of rail to the shoulder at the other end is exactly the same on each  rail. Cut the tenons, using a backsaw and chisel.    Arrange the pieces as they are to stand in the finished basket, and  number each tenon and mortise. Mark all the mortises on the posts, being  sure to keep the distances between the top and lower rail the same on  each post. Cut each mortise to fit the correspondingly numbered tenon.  Next, mark the mortises for the slats in the rails, allowing the whole  slat to go in 1/4 in.    The handles are next in order. The pieces going into the rail should be  fastened with a round 1/2-in. tenon cut on one end and glued in place.  The crosspiece should be mortised all the way through these pieces and  held in place by a brad from the under side.    Now put the whole basket together without gluing, in order that errors,  if any, may be detected.    If everything fits perfectly, the basket is ready to be glued. For best  results hot glue should be used. First glue up two opposite sides with  the slats in place. Clamps must be used. When these have set for at  least 24 hours, the other rails and slats may be glued in place and  clamped. It is a good idea to pin the tenons in place with two 1-in.  brads driven from the inside.    The handles are then glued in place, using hand screws to hold them  until the glue sets. The bottom should rest on thin cleats, without  being nailed to them, so that it may be removed when the basket is to be  emptied of small papers, etc.    Before applying the stain, see that all glue spots are removed and all  surfaces sanded to perfect smoothness. If a fumed finish is not desired,  any good stain may be used, after which a thin coat of shellac and two  coats of wax should be applied. Allow plenty of time for drying between  the coats.          A CELLARETTE PEDESTAL      [Illustration: Plain-Oak Cellarette Pedestal]    The illustration shows a unique article for the den. It serves as a  pedestal and has one side which opens on hinges allowing the inside to  be used as a smoker's cabinet or cellarette. All the lines are straight  and the corners square, making it easy to construct. White oak will  make up best, although ash, birch or southern pine may be used with good  effect.    Stock of the following sizes should be bought, surfaced and cut to width  and length:      2 top pieces, 7/8 by 12 by 12 in., S-2-S.    2 base pieces, 7/8 by 14 by 14 in., S-2-S.    2 sides, 7/8 by 8 by 35-5/8 in., S-2-S.    1 back, 7/8 by 6-1/4 by 35-5/8 in., S-2-S.    1 door, 7/8 by 6-1/4 by 34-3/4 in., S-2-S.    4 blocks, 7/8 by 4 by 4 in., S-2-S.    4 shelves, 7/8 by 6-1/4 by 6-1/4 in., S-2-S.    4 pieces, 7/8 by 1 by 10 in., S-4-S.    Make the top and base of two pieces, glued and screwed together with the  grain crossed. This method prevents warping.

Such flights of ecstasy as \"My Wife's  a Winsome Wee Thing,\" and \"Bonnie Wee Thing,\" are simply tyrannical in  their appeal. Then there is an irresistible \"Polly Stewart;\" and \"My  Peggy's Heart\" is fairly ambrosial. These and several others, like  \"There Was a Bonnie Lass,\" could be made into an album of songs that  would delight a whole suite of generations.    A number of his songs are published: they include a \"John Anderson, My  Jo,\" that has no particular right to live; a ballad, \"Molly,\" with a  touch of art tucked into it; the beautiful \"Sylvan Slumbers,\" and the  quaint and fascinating \"Dutch Garden.\"    Aside from an occasional song like \"Thistledown,\" with its brilliantly  fleecy accompaniment, and the setting of Browning's famous \"The Year'  at the Spring,\" for which Loomis has struck out a superb frenzy, and a  group of songs by John Vance Cheney, Loomis has found some of his most  powerful inspirations in the work of our lyrist, Aldrich,--such as  the rich carillon of \"Wedded,\" and his \"Discipline,\" one of the best  of all humorous songs, a gruesome scherzo all about dead monks, in  which the music furnishes out the grim irreverence of the words with  the utmost waggery.    Chief among the lyrics by Cheney are three \"Spring Songs,\" in which  Loomis has caught the zest of spring with such rapture that, once they  are heard, the world seems poor without them in print. Loomis'  literary culture is shown in the sure taste of his selection of lyrics  for his music. He has marked aptitudes, too, in creative literature,  and has an excellent idea of the arts kindred to his own, particularly  architecture.    Like Chopin, Loomis is largely occupied in mixing rich new colors on  the inexhaustible palette of the piano. Like Chopin, he is not  especially called to the orchestra. What the future may hold for him  in this field (by no means so indispensable to classic repute as  certain pedants assume) it is impossible to say. In the meantime he is  giving most of his time to work in larger forms.    If in his restless hunt for novelty, always novelty, he grows too  original, too unconventional, this sin is unusual enough to approach  the estate of a virtue. But his oddity is not mere sensation-mongering.  It is his individuality. He could make the same reply to such  criticism that Schumann made; he thinks in strange rhythms and hunts  curious effects, because his tastes are irrevocably so ordained.    But we ought to show a new genius the same generosity toward flaws  that we extend toward the masters whose fame is won beyond the  patronage of our petty forgiveness. And, all in all, I am impelled to  prophesy to Loomis a place very high among the inspired makers of new  music. His harmonies, so indefatigably searched out and polished to  splendor, so potent in enlarging the color-scale of the piano; his  patient building up, through long neglect and through long silence, of  a monumental group of works and of a distinct individuality, must  prove at some late day a source of lasting pride to his country,  neglectful now in spite of itself. But better than his patience, than  his courage, than his sincerity, better than that insufficient  definition of genius,--the capacity for taking infinite pains,--is his  inspired felicity. His genius is the very essence of felicity.      _Ethelbert Nevin._    [Illustration: ETHELBERT NEVIN.]    It is refreshing to be able to chronicle the achievements of a  composer who has become financially successful without destroying his  claim on the respect of the learned and severe, or sacrificing his own  artistic conscience and individuality. Such a composer is Ethelbert  Nevin.    His published writings have been altogether along the smaller lines of  composition, and he has won an enviable place as a fervent worker in  diamonds. None of his gems are paste, and a few have a perfection, a  solidity, and a fire that fit them for a place in that coronet one  might fancy made up of the richest of the jewels of the world's  music-makers, and fashioned for the very brows of the Muse herself.    [Illustration: Autograph of Ethelbert Nevin]    Nevin was born in 1862, at Vineacre, on the banks of the Ohio, a few  miles from Pittsburgh. There he spent the first sixteen years of his  life, and received all his schooling, most of it from his father,  Robert P. Nevin, editor and proprietor of a Pittsburgh newspaper, and  a contributor to many magazines. It is interesting to note that he  also composed several campaign songs, among them the popular \"Our  Nominee,\" used in the day of James K. Polk's candidacy. The first  grand piano ever taken across the Allegheny Mountains was carted over  for Nevin's mother.    From his earliest infancy Nevin was musically inclined, and, at the  age of four, was often taken from his cradle to play for admiring  visitors. To make up for the deficiency of his little legs, he used to  pile cushions on the pedals so that he might manipulate them from  afar.    Nevin's father provided for his son both vocal and instrumental  instruction, even taking him abroad for two years of travel and music  study in Dresden under Von Boehme. Later he studied the piano for two  years at Boston, under B.J. Lang, and composition under Stephen A.  Emery, whose little primer on harmony has been to American music  almost what Webster's spelling-book was to our letters.    At the end of two years he went to Pittsburgh, where he gave lessons,  and saved money enough to take him to Berlin. There he spent the  years 1884, 1885, and 1886, placing himself in the hands of Karl  Klindworth. Of him Nevin says: \"To Herr Klindworth I owe everything  that has come to me in my musical life. He was a devoted teacher, and  his patience was tireless. His endeavor was not only to develop the  student from a musical standpoint, but to enlarge his soul in every  way. To do this, he tried to teach one to appreciate and to feel the  influence of such great minds of literature as Goethe, Schiller, and  Shakespeare. He used to insist that a man does not become a musician  by practising so many hours a day at the piano, but by absorbing an  influence from all the arts and all the interests of life, from  architecture, painting, and even politics.\"    The effect of such broad training--enjoyed rarely enough by music  students--is very evident in Nevin's compositions. They are never  narrow or provincial. They are the outpourings of a soul that is not  only intense in its activities, but is refined and cultivated in its  expressions. This effect is seen, too, in the poems Nevin chooses to  set to music,--they are almost without exception verses of literary  finish and value. His cosmopolitanism is also remarkable, his songs in  French, German, and Italian having no trace of Yankee accent and a  great fidelity to their several races.    In 1885, Hans von Buelow incorporated the best four pupils of his  friend, Klindworth, into an artist class, which he drilled personally.  Nevin was one of the honored four, and appeared at the unique public  _Zuhoeren_ of that year, devoted exclusively to the works of Brahms,  Liszt, and Raff. Among the forty or fifty studious listeners at these  recitals, Frau Cosima Wagner, the violinist Joachim, and many other  celebrities were frequently present.    Nevin returned to America in 1887, and took up his residence in  Boston, where he taught and played at occasional concerts.    Eighteen hundred and ninety-two found him in Paris, where he taught,  winning more pupils than here. He was especially happy in imparting to  singers the proper _Auffassung_ (grasp, interpretation, finish) of  songs, and coached many American and French artists for the operatic  stage. In 1893 the restless troubadour moved on to Berlin, where he  devoted himself so ardently to composition that his health collapsed,  and he was exiled a year to Algiers. The early months of 1895 he  spent in concert tours through this country. As Klindworth said of  him, \"he has a touch that brings tears,\" and it is in interpretation  rather than in bravura that he excels. He plays with that unusual  combination of elegance and fervor that so individualizes his  composition.    Desirous of finding solitude and atmosphere for composition, he took  up his residence in Florence, where he composed his suite, \"May in  Tuscany\" (op. 21). The \"Arlecchino\" of this work has much  sprightliness, and shows the influence of Schumann, who made the  harlequin particularly his own; but there is none of Chopin's  nocturnity in the \"Notturno,\" which presents the sussurus and the  moonlit, amorous company of \"Boccaccio's Villa.\" The suite includes a  \"Misericordia\" depicting a midnight cortege along the Arno, and  modelled on Chopin's funeral march in structure with its hoarse dirge  and its rich cantilena. The best number of the suite is surely the  \"Rusignuolo,\" an exceedingly fluty bird-song.    From Florence, Nevin went to Venice, where he lived in an old _casa_  on the Grand Canal, opposite the Browning palazzo, and near the house  where Wagner wrote \"Tristan und Isolde.\" One day his man, Guido, took  a day off, and brought to Venice an Italian sweetheart, who had lived  a few miles from the old dream-city and had never visited it. The day  these two spent gondoliering through the waterways, where romance  hides in every nook, is imaginatively narrated in tone in Nevin's  suite, \"Un Giorno in Venezia,\" a book more handsomely published even  than the others of his works, which have been among the earliest to  throw off the disgraceful weeds of type and design formerly worn by  native compositions.    The Venetian suite gains a distinctly Italian color from its  ingenuously sweet harmonies in thirds and sixths, and its frankly  lyric nature, and \"The Day"]]]
