You stopped him splendidly.  That last shot of  yours brought him up for me to finish.\"    \"Think I hit him, then?\"    \"Think?\" said Emson, laughing.  \"You can easily prove it.  Your bullet  must have hit him end on.  Mine were on his left flank.\"    \"He _is_ dead, isn't he?\" said Dyke dubious.    \"As dead as he can well be,\" said Emson, dismounting, and throwing his  rein over his horse's head.  \"Yes; here we are.  Your bullet caught him  half-way up the back here; one of mine hit him in the side, and here's  the other right through the left shoulder-blade.  That means finis.  But  that shot of yours regularly paralysed him behind.  _Your_ lion, little  un, and that skin will do for your museum.  It's a beauty.\"    \"But _you_ killed him,\" said the boy modestly.    \"Put him out of his misery, that's all.  He is a splendid fellow,  though.  But he won't run away now, little un.--Let's get on.\"    \"But his skin?\" said Dyke eagerly.    \"Too hard a job now, Dyke, under this sun.  We'll come over this evening  with Jack, and strip that off.  Now for the eggs.\"        CHAPTER SEVEN.    LIFE ON THE VELDT.    The task of finding the emptied ostrich nest proved harder than they  expected; but their ride across the barren plain was made interesting by  the sight of a herd of gnus and a couple of the beautiful black  antelope, with their long, gracefully curved, sharp horns.  Just before  reaching the nest, too, they had the rather unusual sight, in their  part, of half-a-dozen giraffes, which went off in their awkward,  lumbering trot toward the north.    At last, though, the nest was reached, the scattered eggs gathered into  the net, and heedless of these chinking together a little, as they hung  between them, they cantered on.    \"Won't do them any good shaking them up so, will it?\" said Dyke.    \"I've given up all idea of setting these,\" said Emson.  \"I should say it  would be very doubtful whether they would hatch, and we want a little  change in the way of feeding, old fellow.  We'll see which are addled,  and which are not.\"    Tanta Sal was at the door as they rode up, and her face expanded  largely, especially about the eyes and mouth, at the sight of the eggs.    \"I say, look at Tant,\" said Dyke merrily.  \"Did you ever see such a  face?\"    \"Never,\" replied Emson quietly.  \"She's not beautiful from our point of  view.\"    \"Beautiful!\"    \"Tastes differ, old chap,\" said Emson.  \"No doubt Jack thought her very  nice-looking.  English people admire small mouths and little waists.  It  is very evident that the Kaffirs do not; and I don't see why a small  mouth should be more beautiful than a large one.\"    \"And there isn't so much of it,\" cried Dyke.    \"Certainly not, and it is not so useful.  No: Tant is not handsome, but  she can cook, and I don't believe that Venus could have fetched water  from the spring in two buckets half so well.\"    \"Don't suppose she could, or made fires either,\" said Dyke, laughing.    \"Very good, then, little un.  Tant is quite good-looking enough for  us.--Hi! there, old girl, take these and keep them cool.  Cook one for  dinner.\"    The woman nodded, took the net, swung it over her back, and the next  minute the creamy-white eggs were seen reposing on the dark skin.    After seeing to the horses, Dyke made some remark to his brother about  wanting his corn too, and he went quietly round to the back, where Tant  was busy over the fire, preparing one of the eggs by cooking it _au  naturel_, not boiling in a saucepan, but making the thick shell itself  do duty for one.    She looked up and showed her teeth as Dyke came in sight, and then went  on with her work, which was that of stirring the egg, whose treatment  was very simple.  She had chipped a little hole in one end, big enough  to admit a stick, and had placed the other end deep down in the glowing  dry cake ashes, squatting down on her heels on one side of the fire,  while Jack sat in a similar position on the other, watching his wife as  she kept on stirring the egg with the piece of wood.    \"Oh there you are, Jack,\" said Dyke; \"we've shot a big lion.\"    \"Baas kill?\"    \"Yes.  You're coming with us to skin it this evening?\"    The Kaffir shook his head, and then lowered it upon one hand, making a  piteous grimace.    \"Jack sick, bad,\" he said.    \"Jack no sick bad,\" cried Tanta, leaping up angrily.    As she spoke, she raised one broad black foot, and gave her husband a  sharp thrust in the ribs, with the result that he rolled over and then  jumped up furiously to retaliate.    \"Ah, would you!\" cried Dyke; and the dog, which had followed him, began  to growl.  \"Yes, you hit her, and I'll set Duke at you,\" cried Dyke.  \"Can't you see he's ashamed?\"    Jack growled fiercely, and his wife reseated herself upon her heels, and  went on stirring the egg again, laughing merrily the while.    \"No sick bad,\" she said; and then wanting to say something more, she  rattled off a series of words, all oom and click, for Jack's benefit,  the Kaffir listening the while.    The egg was soon after declared to be done, and formed a very  satisfactory omelette-like addition to the hard biltong and mealie cake  which formed the ostrich-farmers' dinner.    \"I'd a deal rather we'd shot an antelope, Joe,\" said Dyke, as he ground  away at the biltong, that popular South African delicacy, formed by  cutting fresh meat into long strips, and drying them in the sun before  the flesh has time to go bad--a capital plan in a torrid country, where  decomposition is rapid and salt none too plentiful; but it has its  drawbacks, and is best suited to the taste of those who appreciate the  chewing of leather with a superlatively high flavour of game.    \"Yes, it is time we had some fresh meat, old chap,\" said Emson  good-humouredly.  \"After that slice of luck with the birds, we'll try  for some guinea-fowl or a springbok in the morning.\"    \"I wish we had a river nearer where we could fish,\" said Dyke, as he  worked away at the dried meat.    \"Yes, it would be handy, if we could catch any fish; but we usen't to  get a great many--not enough to live on--in the old days at home.\"    \"Not often,\" said Dyke.  \"I say, it is tough.\"    \"Well, yes.  A well-beaten-out piece would not make a bad shoe sole,  little un.  But about that fishing?  It would take a great many of those  sticklebacks you always would fish for with a worm to make a dish.\"    \"Well, they used to bite, and that's more than your carp would, Joe.  Why, you only used to catch about one a month.\"    \"But, then, look at the size.  One did make a dish.\"    \"Yes, of only head and bones.  Ugh!  I'd rather eat biltong.\"    Emson laughed good-humouredly.    \"Well,\" he said, \"we can't go fishing without we make a hundred miles'  journey, so we can't get fish.  How would a lion steak eat?\"    \"Worse than a cut out of the poor old goblin's breast.  But, I say, are  we to go and skin that old savage to-night?\"    \"I'll go with Jack, and do it, if you're tired.\"    \"That you won't,\" cried Dyke.  \"But, I say, Jack's bad sick he says.\"    \"Yes, I suppose so.  He generally is now, when we want him to work.  We've spoiled Master Jack by feeding him too well; and if it wasn't for  Tanta Sal, Master Jack would have to go upon his travels.  That woman's  a treasure, little un.  She's a capital cook; and what a wonderful thing  it is that it comes so natural to a woman, whether she's white or black,  to like washing shirts.  Do you know, I believe that Tanta Sal would  take to starching and ironing if she had a chance.  Have any more?\"    \"No: done,\" said Dyke, wiping his knife carefully, and returning it to  the sheath he wore in his belt.    \"Then let's go and have a look at the chickens.  Why, the other day I  felt as if I could open all the pens and say to the birds, `There, be  off with you, for you're no good.'\"    \"But now you're going to have another good try.\"    \"Yes; and we must give them greater liberty, and try to let them live in  a more natural way.\"    \"And that means always hunting them and driving them back to the pens.\"    \"We shan't mind that if they all turn out healthy,\" said Emson.  \"Come  along.\"    \"Wait till I call Tant,\" said Dyke; and he went out to the back to  summon the Kaffir woman, who came in smiling, cleared away, and then  proceeded to feed her lord; Duke, the dog, waiting for his turn, and not  being forgotten.    It was like playing at keeping bantams in Brobdingnag, Dyke said, as  they entered the pens pretty well provided with food for the birds, and  going from enclosure to enclosure, armed each with a stout stick,  necessitated by the manners and customs of their charge.  For though it  was plain sailing enough scattering out food for the young birds, which  stalked about looking very solemn and stupid, the full-grown and  elderly, especially the cocks, displayed a desire for more, to which  \"glutton\" would be far too mild a term to apply; while the goblin's  successor, as king of the farm, seemed to have become so puffed up with  pride at his succession to the throne, that the stick had to be applied  several times in response to his insatiable and aggressive demands.    But at last the feeding was done, the hens in attendance on the nest of  eggs visited, where all seemed satisfactory, and then the horses were  saddled, and Jack and Duke summoned.    The latter dashed up instantly; but Jack made no reply.    \"Yes, he is spoiled,\" said Emson.  \"It has always seemed to be so much  less trouble to saddle our own horses than to see that he did it  properly; but we ought to have made him do it, little un.\"    \"Of course we ought,\" said Dyke.  \"It isn't too late to begin now?\"    \"I'm afraid it is,\" said Emson.--\"Here!  Hi!  Jack,\" he shouted; and the  dog supplemented the cry by running toward the house, barking loudly,  with the result that the Kaffir "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#9)"],[1,"also guard all small and weak animals that come  to them for safety.    Did I not tell you that the buffaloes are the Knights of the Jungle?    [Illustration: Tame Water Buffaloes Plowing in the Rice Fields]          CHAPTER VII    Taming the Buffalo      Buffaloes do not always remain wild and wander about in the jungle.  Men need buffaloes. Farmers want to use them for plowing the ground,  in the same way that farmers in America use horses for plowing.    This kind of buffalo also lives in Italy, and because they are so fond  of water they are called _water buffaloes_ there. But in Italy they  are not wild any more, as they have been tamed and used by men for a  long time.    I shall tell you how the men catch the buffaloes from the jungle in  India, where they are still wild.    They catch the buffaloes in many ways. The easiest way is to find some  stream or pond where the buffaloes are fond of going. Then the men  take strong nets made of ropes, and spread the nets under the water.  So when the buffaloes come to bathe or roll in the mud, some of them  are caught in the nets.    Then the men rush in from their hiding place and drag out the nets. Of  course, those buffaloes which are not caught run away. But those that  are caught struggle fiercely. After a time they get tired of  struggling, as the nets are too strong for them to break.    When the buffaloes have become very weak from struggling, a lot of men  rush up and tie a stout rope around the neck of each buffalo. The rope  has two ends, one on each side of the buffalo, and each end is quite  long.    A dozen men haul at the rope, and the buffalo has to get up and march  with them. In this way the men bring the buffaloes one by one to the  village.    How do the men tame the buffaloes? That is quite easy, if they already  have a few tame buffaloes which they may have caught and tamed some  time before. And as the people have been doing this for many, many  years, they always have some tame buffaloes. So this is the way the  men treat the wild buffaloes:      _Wild Buffaloes Tamed Quickly by Kindness_    They put the wild buffaloes and the tame ones together in a pen, or  corral. Inside the corral there is a pond. In the deep part of the  pond there is plenty of good water to drink; and in the shallow part  of the pond there is plenty of mud in which the buffaloes may roll  about and wallow.    The men keep the buffaloes there together for many days, the wild ones  and the tame ones. Every day the men throw into the corral plenty of  fresh grass, which the buffaloes can eat all day.    Now, what more could the wild buffaloes want? They could not be  treated any better! They have plenty to eat, plenty to drink, and  plenty of mud in which to wallow. The tame buffaloes soon make friends  with them, and talk to them in their own language.    \"You will not be any better off in the jungle,\" the tame ones say to  the wild ones. \"Here you do not have to walk about all day to get  enough to eat, and then walk a good way to find water to drink, or a  place in which to wallow. And, also, we have no fear of tigers here.  What more do you want?\"    So in a few weeks the wild ones become quite tame. Still, even after  that, the old and the new ones are always kept together, and soon they  become like one herd.    Afterwards, when the farmers use them for plowing, they always hitch  to the plow one buffalo that has been tame for a long time, and one  that is newly-tamed. Then it becomes easy for the new one to learn the  work by just doing as his friend does.    The farmer uses the buffaloes for plowing for only a few hours, and he  gives them plenty of time for wallowing and enjoying themselves. So,  even if they have to do a little work, the new buffaloes soon see that  they are really much better off living in the village than running  wild in the jungle.    After the plowing season is over, the buffaloes have no work at all.  They can wallow all day, if they want to.    When all the new buffaloes are quite tame, they are not kept in the  corral any more, as they would never think of running away now. They  are allowed to lie about and sleep in a little plot of ground  somewhere in the village. By daytime they are taken out into the  fields outside the village, and allowed to graze as they please; and  as there is always a stream or a pond near, the buffaloes can go into  the water or the mud whenever they like.    So, as you understand, the buffaloes very soon become quite tame. Why?  Because they are treated kindly. Please remember that. _Most wild  animals can be tamed if treated kindly._    Now I am coming to the nicest part about the buffaloes. It is the  nicest part because it shows how the buffaloes can even be made to  love us.    I have just told you that the buffaloes are taken out into the fields  to graze. Well, then, somebody has to do that in the morning, and  somebody has to bring them home in the evening.    Can you tell who does that? Why, there is a herdsman to do it, you may  say. Quite true. But the herdsman does not bother to do a simple thing  like that every day.      _Little Boys Take Charge of Buffaloes_    Then who does it? I shall tell you. The little boys of the village!  They are about five or six years of age. They are not old enough to go  to school, and not old enough to do any work; so they can play all  day.    The most useful thing they can do is to take charge of the buffaloes.  The boys soon learn all the buffalo calls--\"Come out to graze,\" \"Come  to wallow,\" or \"Come home now.\" And the wonderful thing is that these  huge animals soon learn to obey these calls. When the boys call to  them, the buffaloes do just as they are ordered.    The buffaloes soon learn to love the little boys. You know how fond of  us an animal can become--especially a dog or a horse. Still, I do not  think that any animal can show such love for us as the huge buffaloes  do for the little boys who act as their herdsmen.    Why? Because the little boys _share the same mud_ with the buffaloes!  Boys and buffaloes mix very well with mud! The little boys tumble  about in the mud on the side of the bank where the buffaloes may be  wallowing. Or the boys will splash about in the water where the  buffaloes are lying neck deep to keep cool. Or they will climb up on  the buffaloes' backs for a while, then tumble off and play again.    Even when the buffaloes are grazing in the field, the boys may be near  them, playing hide and seek, and running in and out between the  buffaloes' legs, or under their horns. So the boys are with the  buffaloes all day long.      _How the Big Buffaloes Love the Little Boys_    It is quite wonderful to see a little boy actually twisting a huge  buffalo's tail. As I have told you, a buffalo is often more than ten  feet long, and taller than a tall man; and it has horns that reach  out more than a yard from each side of the head. This huge animal  could charge and smash up a big wagon as easily as if it were a match  box; and yet he will stand still and let his tail be twisted by any  little tot in the village.    Sometimes you may see a sight like this: A huge buffalo is grazing  hungrily, and a little boy comes up and stands right in front of him.    \"Put up your head!\" says the boy. But the buffalo goes on feeding  hungrily.    \"Put up your head, or I will spank you!\" says the boy. But the buffalo  still goes on feeding hungrily.    Then that tot raises his small hand and spanks the huge buffalo on the  jaw. The buffalo puts up his head, and rubs his nose lovingly against  the boy.    Well, why not? You have seen a baby pulling his Papa's hair. The Papa  just loves the baby all the more for it. So it is with the buffalo and  the little tot. And it would not matter a bit whether the tot were a  little boy or a little girl. The big buffalo is fond of both.    And now I shall tell you a wonderful true story about a buffalo and a  boy.          CHAPTER VIII    The Buffalo and the Boy      In a village there were many tame buffaloes, and among them thirty  bull buffaloes. The little boys of the village took charge of them  every day. The smartest boy among them was called Gulab. He was six  years of age.    Gulab knew quite well each of the thirty bull buffaloes, and was a  friend of each. Sometimes he alone had charge of them, and took them  out to graze and to wallow. That was because his father was the  herdsman.    The buffaloes loved Gulab, and they did exactly as he told them to do.  When he was going to take them to the fields, he would just stamp his  little bare foot and call out to them \"Stand in rows!\" And the huge  animals would stand in rows, one line behind another.    Then Gulab would come around to the side, and see if each line was  straight. If the line was not quite straight, and a buffalo happened  to be standing too much this way or that, Gulab would walk up to the  buffalo and spank him on the jaw. Then the buffalo would move into  line, exactly as Gulab wanted him to do. Or, if a buffalo happened to  be standing too far behind, Gulab would come around to the back and  twist the buffalo's tail, and the buffalo would move up into line.    Then, when the whole herd was in the right order, Gulab would come to  the front of the herd, and walk up to the biggest bull.    \"Bend down your head, Baldo!\" he would order.    And Baldo, the biggest bull, in the middle of the front line, would  bend down his head, and Gulab would climb up by one of the horns,  scramble up Baldo's neck, and sit down on his back.    \"March!\" Gulab would order--and the whole herd would march.    Now, a few miles away there was a grand palace. In the palace was a  little Prince, whose father was a Rajah--that is, a kind of king. The  little Prince's birthday was coming, and his father ordered grand  feasts for many days.    The Rajah had six English friends, who were quite big men. The  Englishmen were very fond of tiger hunting, so the Rajah "]]]
