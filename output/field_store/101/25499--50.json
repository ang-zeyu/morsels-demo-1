He also entreated God to  accept of his sacrifice, and to grant that the earth might never again  undergo the like effects of 'his wrath; that men might be permitted to  go on cheerfully in cultivating the same; to build cities, and live  happily in them; and that they might not be deprived of any of those  good things which they enjoyed before the Flood; but might attain to the  like length of days, and old age, which the ancient people had arrived  at before.    8. When Noah had made these supplications, God, who loved the man for  his righteousness, granted entire success to his prayers, and said, that  it was not he who brought the destruction on a polluted world, but that  they underwent that vengeance on account of their own wickedness; and  that he had not brought men into the world if he had himself determined  to destroy them, it being an instance of greater wisdom not to have  granted them life at all, than, after it was granted, to procure their  destruction; \"But the injuries,\" said he, \"they offered to my holiness  and virtue, forced me to bring this punishment upon them. But I will  leave off for the time to come to require such punishments, the effects  of so great wrath, for their future wicked actions, and especially on  account of thy prayers. But if I shall at any time send tempests of  rain, in an extraordinary manner, be not affrighted at the largeness of  the showers; for the water shall no more overspread the earth. However,  I require you to abstain from shedding the blood of men, and to keep  yourselves pure from murder; and to punish those that commit any such  thing. I permit you to make use of all the other living creatures at  your pleasure, and as your appetites lead you; for I have made you lords  of them all, both of those that walk on the land, and those that swim in  the waters, and of those that fly in the regions of the air on high,  excepting their blood, for therein is the life. But I will give you a  sign that I have left off my anger by my bow.\" [whereby is meant the  rainbow, for they determined that the rainbow was the bow of God]. And  when God had said and promised thus, he went away.    9. Now when Noah had lived three hundred and fifty years after the  Flood, and that all that time happily, he died, having lived the number  of nine hundred and fifty years. But let no one, upon comparing the  lives of the ancients with our lives, and with the few years which we  now live, think that what we have said of them is false; or make the  shortness of our lives at present an argument, that neither did they  attain to so long a duration of life, for those ancients were beloved of  God, and [lately] made by God himself; and because their food was then  fitter for the prolongation of life, might well live so great a number  of years: and besides, God afforded them a longer time of life on  account of their virtue, and the good use they made of it in  astronomical and geometrical discoveries, which would not have afforded  the time of foretelling [the periods of the stars] unless they had lived  six hundred years; for the great year is completed in that interval. Now  I have for witnesses to what I have said, all those that have written  Antiquities, both among the Greeks and barbarians; for even Manetho, who  wrote the Egyptian History, and Berosus, who collected the Chaldean  Monuments, and Mochus, and Hestieus, and, besides these, Hieronymus the  Egyptian, and those who composed the Phoenician History, agree to what I  here say: Hesiod also, and Hecatseus, Hellanicus, and Acusilaus; and,  besides these, Ephorus and Nicolaus relate that the ancients lived a  thousand years. But as to these matters, let every one look upon them as  he thinks fit.              CHAPTER 4. Concerning The Tower Of Babylon, And The Confusion Of  Tongues.    1. Now the sons of Noah were three,Â—Shem, Japhet, and Ham, born one  hundred years before the Deluge. These first of all descended from the  mountains into the plains, and fixed their habitation there; and  persuaded others who were greatly afraid of the lower grounds on account  of the flood, and so were very loath to come down from the higher  places, to venture to follow their examples. Now the plain in which they  first dwelt was called Shinar. God also commanded them to send colonies  abroad, for the thorough peopling of the earth, that they might not  raise seditions among themselves, but might cultivate a great part of  the earth, and enjoy its fruits after a plentiful manner. But they were  so ill instructed that they did not obey God; for which reason they fell  into calamities, and were made sensible, by experience, of what sin they  had been guilty: for when they flourished with a numerous youth, God  admonished them again to send out colonies; but they, imagining the  prosperity they enjoyed was not derived from the favor of God, but  supposing that their own power was the proper cause of the plentiful  condition they were in, did not obey him. Nay, they added to this their  disobedience to the Divine will, the suspicion that they were therefore  ordered to send out separate colonies, that, being divided asunder, they  might the more easily be Oppressed.    2. Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of  God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of  great strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God, as  if it was through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was  their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually  changed the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men  from the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on  his power. He also said he would be revenged on God, if he should have a  mind to drown the world again; for that he would build a tower too high  for the waters to be able to reach! and that he would avenge himself on  God for destroying their forefathers!    3. Now the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of  Nimrod, and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they  built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree  negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands  employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but  the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that  thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it  really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar,  made of bitumen, that it might not be liable to admit water. When God  saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them  utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the  former sinners; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them  divers languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those  languages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place  wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the  confusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the  Hebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion. The Sibyl also makes mention  of this tower, and of the confusion of the language, when she says thus:  \"When all men were of one language, some of them built a high tower, as  if they would thereby ascend up to heaven, but the gods sent storms of  wind and overthrew the tower, and gave every one his peculiar language;  and for this reason it was that the city was called Babylon.\" But as to  the plan of Shinar, in the country of Babylonia, Hestiaeus mentions it,  when he says thus: \"Such of the priests as were saved, took the sacred  vessels of Jupiter Enyalius, and came to Shinar of Babylonia.\"              CHAPTER 5. After What Manner The Posterity Of Noah Sent Out Colonies,  And Inhabited The Whole Earth.    1. After this they were dispersed abroad, on account of their languages,  and went out by colonies every where; and each colony took possession of  that land which they light upon, and unto which God led them; so that  the whole continent was filled with them, both the inland and the  maritime countries. There were some also who passed over the sea in  ships, and inhabited the islands: and some of those nations do still  retain the denominations which were given them by their first founders;  but some have lost them also, and some have only admitted certain  changes in them, that they might be the more intelligible to the  inhabitants. And they were the Greeks who became the authors of such  mutations. For when in after-ages they grew potent, they claimed to  themselves the glory of antiquity; giving names to the nations that  sounded well [in Greek] that they might be better understood among  themselves; and setting agreeable forms of government over them, as if  they were a people derived from themselves.              CHAPTER 6. How Every Nation Was Denominated From Their First  Inhabitants.    1. Now they were the grandchildren of Noah, in honor of whom names were  imposed on the nations by those that first seized upon them. Japhet, the  son of Noah, had seven sons: they inhabited so, that, beginning at the  mountains Taurus and Amanus, they proceeded along"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#9)"],[1," this exile, that was to be from its beginning during  those fatally determined thirteen years. Moreover, he pitched a camp for  his Ethiopian army, as a guard to king Amenophis, upon the borders of  Egypt. And this was the state of things in Ethiopia. But for the people  of Jerusalem, when they came down together with the polluted Egyptians,  they treated the men in such a barbarous manner, that those who saw how  they subdued the forementioned country, and the horrid wickedness they  were guilty of, thought it a most dreadful thing; for they did not only  set the cities and villages on fire but were not satisfied till they had  been guilty of sacrilege, and destroyed the images of the gods, and used  them in roasting those sacred animals that used to be worshipped, and  forced the priests and prophets to be the executioners and murderers of  those animals, and then ejected them naked out of the country. It was  also reported that the priest, who ordained their polity and their laws,  was by birth of Hellopolls, and his name Osarsiph, from Osyris, who was  the god of Hellopolls; but that when he was gone over to these people,  his name was changed, and he was called Moses.\"    27. This is what the Egyptians relate about the Jews, with much more,  which I omit for the sake of brevity. But still Manetho goes on, that  \"after this, Amenophis returned back from Ethiopia with a great army,  as did his son Ahampses with another army also, and that both of them  joined battle with the shepherds and the polluted people, and beat them,  and slew a great many of them, and pursued them to the bounds of  Syria.\" These and the like accounts are written by Manetho. But I will  demonstrate that he trifles, and tells arrant lies, after I have made a  distinction which will relate to what I am going to say about him;  for this Manetho had granted and confessed that this nation was not  originally Egyptian, but that they had come from another country, and  subdued Egypt, and then went away again out of it. But that those  Egyptians who were thus diseased in their bodies were not mingled with  us afterward, and that Moses who brought the people out was not one of  that company, but lived many generations earlier, I shall endeavor to  demonstrate from Manetho's own accounts themselves.    28. Now, for the first occasion of this fiction, Manetho supposes what  is no better than a ridiculous thing; for he says that, \"King Amenophis  desired to see the gods.\" What gods, I pray, did he desire to see? If  he meant the gods whom their laws ordained to be worshipped, the ox, the  goat, the crocodile, and the baboon, he saw them already; but for the  heavenly gods, how could he see them, and what should occasion this his  desire? To be sure? it was because another king before him had already  seen them. He had then been informed what sort of gods they were, and  after what manner they had been seen, insomuch that he did not stand in  need of any new artifice for obtaining this sight. However, the prophet  by whose means the king thought to compass his design was a wise man.  If so, how came he not to know that such his desire was impossible to  be accomplished? for the event did not succeed. And what pretense could  there be to suppose that the gods would not be seen by reason of the  people's maims in their bodies, or leprosy? for the gods are not angry  at the imperfection of bodies, but at wicked practices; and as to eighty  thousand lepers, and those in an ill state also, how is it possible to  have them gathered together in one day? nay, how came the king not to  comply with the prophet? for his injunction was, that those that were  maimed should be expelled out of Egypt, while the king only sent them  to work in the quarries, as if he were rather in want of laborers, than  intended to purge his country. He says further, that, \"this prophet slew  himself, as foreseeing the anger of the gods, and those events which  were to come upon Egypt afterward; and that he left this prediction for  the king in writing.\" Besides, how came it to pass that this prophet  did not foreknow his own death at the first? nay, how came he not to  contradict the king in his desire to see the gods immediately? how came  that unreasonable dread upon him of judgments that were not to happen  in his lifetime? or what worse thing could he suffer, out of the fear  of which he made haste to kill himself? But now let us see the silliest  thing of all:--The king, although he had been informed of these things,  and terrified with the fear of what was to come, yet did not he even  then eject these maimed people out of his country, when it had been  foretold him that he was to clear Egypt of them; but, as Manetho says,  \"he then, upon their request, gave them that city to inhabit, which had  formerly belonged to the shepherds, and was called Avaris; whither when  they were gone in crowds,\" he says, \"they chose one that had formerly  been priest of Hellopolls; and that this priest first ordained that they  should neither worship the gods, nor abstain from those animals that  were worshipped by the Egyptians, but should kill and eat them all, and  should associate with nobody but those that had conspired with them;  and that he bound the multitude by oaths to be sure to continue in  those laws; and that when he had built a wall about Avaris, he made  war against the king.\" Manetho adds also, that \"this priest sent to  Jerusalem to invite that people to come to his assistance, and promised  to give them Avaris; for that it had belonged to the forefathers of  those that were coming from Jerusalem, and that when they were come,  they made a war immediately against the king, and got possession of  all Egypt.\" He says also that \"the Egyptians came with an army of  two hundred thousand men, and that Amenophis, the king of Egypt, not  thinking that he ought to fight against the gods, ran away presently  into Ethiopia, and committed Apis and certain other of their sacred  animals to the priests, and commanded them to take care of preserving  them.\" He says further, that, \"the people of Jerusalem came accordingly  upon the Egyptians, and overthrew their cities, and burnt their temples,  and slew their horsemen, and, in short, abstained from no sort of  wickedness nor barbarity; and for that priest who settled their polity  and their laws,\" he says, \"he was by birth of Hellopolis, and his name  was Osarsiph, from Osyris the god of Hellopolis, but that he changed his  name, and called himself Moses.\" He then says that \"on the thirteenth  year afterward, Amenophis, according to the fatal time of the duration  of his misfortunes, came upon them out of Ethiopia with a great army,  and joining battle with the shepherds and with the polluted people,  overcame them in battle, and slew a great many of them, and pursued them  as far as the bounds of Syria.\"    29. Now Manetho does not reflect upon the improbability of his lie; for  the leprous people, and the multitude that was with them, although  they might formerly have been angry at the king, and at those that had  treated them so coarsely, and this according to the prediction of the  prophet; yet certainly, when they were come out of the mines, and had  received of the king a city, and a country, they would have grown milder  towards him. However, had they ever so much hated him in particular,  they might have laid a private plot against himself, but would hardly  have made war against all the Egyptians; I mean this on the account of  the great kindred they who were so numerous must have had among them.  Nay still, if they had resolved to fight with the men, they would not  have had impudence enough to fight with their gods; nor would they have  ordained laws quite contrary to those of their own country, and to  those in which they had been bred up themselves. Yet are we beholden  to Manethe, that he does not lay the principal charge of this horrid  transgression upon those that came from Jerusalem, but says that the  Egyptians themselves were the most guilty, and that they were their  priests that contrived these things, and made the multitude take their  oaths for doing so. But still how absurd is it to suppose that none  of these people's own relations or friends should be prevailed with  to revolt, nor to undergo the hazards of war with them, while these  polluted people were forced to send to Jerusalem, and bring their  auxiliaries from thence! What friendship, I pray, or what relation  was there formerly between them that required this assistance? On the  contrary, these people were enemies, and greatly differed from them in  their customs. He says, indeed, that they complied immediately, upon  their praising them that they should conquer Egypt; as if they did not  themselves very well know that country out of which they had been driven  by force. Now had these men been in want, or lived miserably, perhaps  they might have undertaken so hazardous an enterprise; but as they dwelt  in a happy city, and had a large country, and one better than Egypt  itself, how came it about that, for the sake of those that had of old  been their enemies, of those that were maimed in their bodies, and of  those whom none of their own relations would endure, they should run  such hazards in assisting them? For they could not foresee that the  king would run away from them: on the contrary, he saith himself that  \"Amenophis's son had three hundred thousand men with him, and met them  at Pelusium.\" Now, to be sure, those that came could not be ignorant of  this; but for the king's repentance and flight, how could they possibly  guess at it? He then says, that \"those who came from Jerusalem, and made  this invasion, got the granaries of Egypt into their possession, and  perpetrated many of the most horrid actions there.\" And thence he  reproaches them, as though he had not himself introduced them as  enemies, or as though he might accuse such as"]]]
