You forget that  it is the president himself you're talking to. You shouldn't have said  what you did, even though it's true.\"    But Peter scarcely heard.    He was watching his father--watching his face for the gleam that did not  come.    \"I will consider what you have said, Strong,\" replied Mr. Coddington  after a pause. \"I will acknowledge that I was ignorant of the fact that  the spot meant anything to the people of the community. If the  conditions are as you say we may be able to find a solution for the  problem. May we consider this interview at an end?\"    Although the remark was in the form of a question the committee felt  itself dismissed and uncomfortably the men filed into the corridor.    \"We've gained nothing!\" was Bryant's first word when they found  themselves alone. \"We've only succeeded in antagonizing Mr. Coddington  and solidified his intention of taking the field. We might have got  somewhere if Strong had not put his foot in it. What possessed you to  pitch into the president like that, young fellow?\"    \"What made you speak at all?\" put in Carmachel. \"Don't you know your  place better than to think a rich man like Mr. Coddington is going to  stand for having a kid like you lay down the law to him? How ever did  you dare? Your job is gone--that's certain. I'm sorry, too, for we all  like you here at the works.\"    \"Oh, Peter! Peter! Why did you say it?\" wailed Nat Jackson. \"I know you  had the best of intentions, but don't you see that you've upset the  whole thing?\"    There was something very like a sob in Nat's tone.    Poor Peter! From every hand came reproaches. If only he had not spoken!  His impulse, good at heart, had been one of mistaken zeal. It was not  that he himself had lost his cause--he had lost it for hundreds of men  in whom he had become interested, and whom he had struggled to serve.    Very wretched the boy was for the remainder of the day; when night came  he dreaded to go home. What would his father say to him?    Peter might have saved himself this worry, for when he entered the  dining-room and sat down to dinner he found the good-humor of his father  quite undisturbed and no allusion was made to the day's occurrence.  Surely this was carrying out to the letter the agreement they had made.  Peter Coddington was his son and he treated him as such; but to Peter  Strong, the boy of the tannery, he had nothing to say. Miserably Peter  waited for the opportunity to offer explanation or apology. It did not  come and all chance for securing it vanished when, directly after the  coffee was served, Mr. Coddington rose, announced that he had an  engagement, and was whirled off in the motor-car. He did not return  until long after his son was asleep.    Had Peter known what this mysterious engagement was his slumbers would  have been happier, for the president of the company had gone on no idle  errand. Screened from view in the far corner of the big touring-car he  had ridden past the tanneries and with his own eyes had seen the benches  in the ball field thronged with sweltering humanity. Twice, three times  he passed. He saw the boys at their games; the tired mothers resting in  the twilight; the babies that toddled at their feet; and the men--his  men--lying full-length on the grass drinking in the cool air. This was  what he had come out to see.    The result of it was that the next morning, in the doorway of every  factory of the Coddington Company, the following notice was posted:         After careful investigation Mr. Coddington has decided that it is       for the interest of his men that the plan to erect a building on       the ball field be abandoned. Instead the land will be laid out as a       recreation ground to be known as Strong Park, and to be reserved       for the Coddington employees, their families, and their friends.       Negotiations have been opened for a site on Central Street, where       the new patent leather factory will shortly be erected.                                       Signed: H. M. CODDINGTON, President.    What an ovation the men gave Peter that day! And how grateful Peter was  to his father! So grateful that before going to bed he felt compelled to  break their compact of silence and exclaim:    \"Father, it's splendid of you to keep the field for the men! I can't  thank you half enough, sir. But you ought not to name it after me.\"    \"I'm not naming it after you,\" was his father's laconic reply. \"I'm  naming it after Peter Strong.\"          [Illustration]    CHAPTER V    A CATASTROPHE      In an incredibly short space of time Strong Park began to be a reality.  Men commenced grading its uneven turf; laying out walks and flower-beds;  erecting benches and a band stand, and setting out trees and shrubs. An  ample area at one end of the grounds was reserved for a ball field; and  adjoining it parallel bars, traveling rings, and the apparatus necessary  to an out-of-door gymnasium was put in place.    All these arrangements Peter witnessed with delight. He longed to tell  his father so, but unfortunately was granted no opportunity. Once, and  once only, did Mr. Coddington refer to the project and that was to  inquire whimsically of Peter if his friend Strong was satisfied with the  preparations, and whether he had any suggestions to make. Young Strong  had no suggestions, Peter declared. He thought the park perfect. And  indeed it was! Neither thought nor money had been spared to make it so.    Peter was very proud of his father those days when, on every hand, he  heard the men extolling the president's generosity. More than once the  great secret of his relation to the Coddingtons trembled on his lips and  almost slipped from him, but he succeeded in holding it resolutely in  check. Despite his intimacy with Nat and his frequent visits to the  Jackson home not a hint of his real identity escaped him. His assumed  role was made easier, perhaps, by the fact that he had entered so  heartily into it. He was really living the career of Peter Strong, and  the Peter Coddington who had idled away so many months in purposeless,  irresponsible dallying was rapidly becoming but a hazy memory. There was  no denying that Peter Strong's life was the far more interesting  one--every day it became more absorbing.    \"You see we're really doing something!\" exclaimed Peter enthusiastically  to Nat Jackson one Saturday afternoon when they were taking one of their  long tramps together. \"Washing and carting skins isn't much in itself,  and it would not be any fun at all if it wasn't part of the chain. But  when you think how necessary a step in the process it is, and consider  that there could be no leather unless somebody did just what I am doing,  it seems well worth while. I never did anything before that was actually  necessary. It is rather good sport.\"    And, in truth, Peter was doing something. Had he doubted it the ever  increasing fund toward his motorcycle would have been a tangible proof.  Already it was quite a little nest-egg and the boy, who had never before  earned a penny, felt justifiably proud of the crisp bills that he was  able to tuck at intervals into the bank. Once more, as a recognition of  his faithful work, his pay had been raised--this time to seven dollars.    It was toward the middle of August that Mr. Tyler, the superintendent,  who evidently was keeping closer watch of Peter's progress than he had  suspected, notified him that on the fifteenth he was to leave the  beamhouse and report in the finishing department. Peter was not only  astonished but a good deal distressed. He had worked not a whit harder  or more faithfully than had Nat Jackson, and deserved the promotion no  more--in fact not as much as his chum. It seemed grossly unfair. Peter  turned the matter over and over in his mind. He would have rejoiced in  the good fortune had he considered it came to him justly; but to take  what belonged to somebody else--that robbed it of all its charm. He  thought and thought what he should do and at last he gained courage to  go to Mr. Tyler with his dilemma. An appeal for his friend could do no  harm and it might do good.    When he had made his errand known the superintendent tilted back in his  chair and regarded him in silence.    \"Jackson is far better informed as to the processes than I am, Mr.  Tyler,\" Peter pleaded. \"Besides, he has a mother to support and needs to  get on. If there is only one vacancy in the finishing department can't  you give him the chance? He has been a year in the beamhouse already,  and if there is a promotion it belongs by right to him.\"    Mr. Tyler fingered his watch-chain. He had never had precisely this  experience before--to try to push a man and have him beg that you give  his good luck to somebody else. Surely this Peter Strong was an  extraordinary person! Mr. Tyler could now understand how even the  president of the company, under the spell of his simple eloquence, had  not only surrendered a valuable building lot for a park but had actually  named it after the youthful enthusiast. The superintendent couldn't but  admire the lad's earnestness. At the same time, however, he did not at  all fancy having his plans questioned or interfered with; therefore when  he spoke it was to dash Peter's demands to earth with a rebuff.    \"Most men would hail with gratitude an opening that took them out of  the beamhouse, Strong,\" replied he stiffly. \"It is generous of you, no  doubt, to make this plea for your friend, but you see you are the person  recommended for the promotion. In this world we must take our chances as  they come. Unfortunately the opportunities of life are not transferable,  my boy. I will, however, bear Jackson in mind and see if anything can be  done for him. Good-morning.\"    The nod of Mr. Tyler's head was final.    Peter turned away, heart-sick at his failure. He had done all he could  unless, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25828"],[0,"History of Australia and New Zealand (#9)"],[1,"er, and of natives who might massacre  them in revenge, kept the scattered settlers in constant terror and  trouble.      #8. Governor Sorell.#--But in 1817, when Governor Davey grew tired of his  position and resigned it, choosing rather to live an easy-going life on  his estate near Hobart Town, than be troubled with the cares of office,  Colonel Sorell, the new Governor, set himself with vigour to suppress  these ruthless marauders. He was to some extent successful, and the  young colony enjoyed an interval of peace. Farming was profitable, and  the exports of wheat began to assume large dimensions. The best breeds  of sheep were brought into the island, and Van Diemen's Land wool, which  at first had been despised in England, and used only for stuffing  mattresses, grew into favour, and was bought by the manufacturers at  high prices. Thus many of the settlers became wealthy, and the estates  from which their wealth was derived began to have a correspondingly  high value, so as to give the colony an assured prosperity which was  certainly remarkable in the sixteenth year from its foundation. Another  industry was added, which indirectly contributed to the wealth of  Tasmania. The captain of a merchant vessel, on his way to Sydney, had  seen a great shoal of whales off the south coast of Tasmania, and, along  with the Governor of New South Wales, secretly formed a scheme to fit  out a whaling expedition. But his crew also had seen the whales, and  soon made the fact widely known; so that, by the time the captain's  party was ready to sail, there were several other whaling vessels on the  point of starting. They were all successful, and very soon a large  number of ships was engaged in whale fishing. Now, as Hobart Town was  the nearest port, the whalers found that it saved time to go thither  with their oil, and to buy their provisions and refit their ships there;  so that the trade and importance of the little city received a very  material impetus in this way.    Much of the progress was due to the sensible management of Governor  Sorell, who spared no effort to reform the convicts, as well as to  elevate and refine the free settlers. Hence it was with great regret  that the colonists saw his term of office expire in 1824. They  petitioned the English Government to allow him to stay for another six  years; and when the reply was given that this could not be done, as  Colonel Sorell was required elsewhere, they presented him with a  handsome testimonial, and settled on him an income of L500 a year from  their own revenues.      #9. Governor Arthur.#--After Colonel Sorell had left, bushranging became  as troublesome as ever. Governor Arthur arrived in 1824, and found the  colony fast relapsing into its former unsettled state. He learnt that,  shortly before, some thirteen or fourteen convicts had succeeded in  escaping from the penal settlement in an open boat, and had landed on a  lonely part of the coast. They were joined by a great crowd of concealed  convicts, and, under the leadership of Crawford and Brady, formed a  dangerous horde of robbers, who, for years, kept the whole colony in  terror. For a while they plundered without hindrance, till a party of  about a dozen attacked the house of an old gentleman named Taylor, who  had the courage to fight and defeat them. With his three sons, his  carpenter, and his servant, he fired upon the advancing ruffians, whilst  his daughters rapidly reloaded the muskets. The robbers retreated,  leaving their leader--Crawford--and two or three others, who had been  wounded, to be captured by Mr. Taylor and sent to Hobart Town, where  they were executed. Brady then became chief leader of the band, and  though his encounter with Mr. Taylor had taken away all his ardour for  fighting, he contrived to plunder and annoy for a long time. Deep in  the woods, along the silent banks of the Shannon, the outlaws lived  securely; for, even when the soldiers ventured to penetrate into these  lonely regions, the outlaws could easily escape to the rugged mountain  sides, where they could hide or defend themselves. Governor Arthur's  task was not an easy one, for Brady could command a powerful force, and  his was not the only one of the kind; the result was that, for a long  time, the country was unsettled and trade was paralysed. Seeing no other  course open, Governor Arthur offered a pardon and a free passage home to  those who surrendered. So many were thus induced to submit peaceably  that, at length, Brady was almost alone; and whilst he wandered in a  secluded valley, without followers, he was surprised by John Batman,  who, several years after, assisted in the settlement of Victoria. Brady  surrendered and was executed; the bushrangers, by degrees, disappeared,  and the colonists once more breathed freely.      #10. Separation.#--Hitherto Tasmania had only been a dependency of New  South Wales, but in 1825 it was made a separate colony, with a Supreme  Court of its own. In 1829 it received its first legislative body,  fifteen gentlemen being appointed to consult with the Governor and make  laws for the colony. For some years after, the history of Tasmania is  simply an account of quiet industry and steady progress. Hobart Town, by  degrees, grew to be a fine city, with handsome buildings and well kept  streets. The country districts were fenced in and well tilled, good  roads and bridges were made, and everything looked smiling and  prosperous. The only serious difficulty was the want of coin for the  ordinary purposes of trade. So great was the scarcity of gold and silver  money that pieces of paper, with promises to pay a certain sum--perhaps  a sixpence or a shilling--were largely used in the colony, in place of  the money itself. At the request of Governor Arthur, coins to the value  of a hundred thousand pounds were sent out from England for the use of  the colonists.    Governor Arthur's period of office expired in 1836, and he left the  colony, greatly to the regret of the colonists, who subscribed L1,500 to  present him with a testimonial. He was succeeded by Sir John Franklin,  the famous voyager, whose history will be related in a subsequent  chapter.          CHAPTER VI.    NEW SOUTH WALES, 1808-1837.      #1. Governor Macquarie.#--In 1808 the English Government held an inquiry  as to the circumstances which had caused the expulsion of Governor  Bligh; and though they cashiered Major Johnstone, and indeed ordered the  whole of the New South Wales Corps to be disbanded, yet, as it was clear  that Bligh had been himself very much to blame, they yielded to the  wishes of the settlers in so far as to appoint a new Governor in his  place, and therefore despatched Major-General Macquarie to take the  position. He was directed to reinstate Bligh for a period of twenty-four  hours, in order to indicate that the authorities in England would not  suffer the colonists to dictate to them in these matters; but that they  reserved completely to themselves the right to appoint and dismiss the  Governors. However, as Bligh had by this time gone to Tasmania,  Macquarie was forced to content himself, on his arrival, with merely  proclaiming what had been his instructions.    [Illustration: GOVERNOR MACQUARIE.]    In the early days of the colonies their destinies were, to a great  extent, moulded by the Governors who had charge of them. Whether for  good or for evil, the influence of the Governor was decisive; and it  was, therefore, a matter of great good fortune to Sydney that, during  the long administration of Governor Lachlan Macquarie, this influence  was almost wholly on the side of good. Not that Macquarie had no faults.  He was a man full of vanity and self-conceit; a man who, instead of  sober despatches to his superiors in England, wrote flowery accounts of  himself and his wonderful doings; a man who, in his egoism, affixed the  names of himself and of his family to nearly every place discovered in  the colony during his term of office. Yet, apart from this weakness,  Macquarie may be characterised as an exemplary man and an admirable  Governor. He devoted himself heartily to his work; his chief thought for  twelve years was how to improve the state of the little colony, and how  to raise the degraded men who had been sent thither. An ardent feeling  of philanthropy gave a kindly tone to his restless activity. Once every  year he made a complete tour of the settled portions of the colony, to  observe their condition and discover what improvements were needed. He  taught the farmers to build for themselves neat houses, in place of the  rude huts they had previously been content with; he encouraged them to  improve their system of farming, sometimes with advice, sometimes with  money, but more often with loans from the Government stores. He built  churches and schools; he took the warmest interest in the progress of  religion and of education; and neglected nothing that could serve to  elevate the moral tone of the little community. Certainly, no community  has ever been in greater need of elevation. The fact that the British  Government thought it necessary to send out 1,100 soldiers to keep order  among a population of only 10,000 indicates very plainly what was the  character of these people, and almost justifies the sweeping assertion  of Macquarie, that the colony consisted of those \"who had been  transported, and those who ought to have been\". Yet Macquarie uniformly  showed a kindly disposition towards the convicts; he settled great  numbers of them as free men on little farms of their own; and if they  did not succeed as well as they might have done, it was not for want of  advice and assistance from the Governor.      #2. Road over the Blue Mountains.# The most important result of  Macquarie's activity was the opening up of new country. He had quite a  passion for road-making; and though, on his arrival in the colony, he  found only forty-five miles of what were "]]]
