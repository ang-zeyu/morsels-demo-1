As he passed the rock behind which Buck lay sprawled on his face he  uttered a piercing whoop of triumph and leaned forward on his pony's  neck. Twenty leaps farther and the spiteful crack of a rifle echoed from  where the foreman was painfully supporting himself on his elbows. The  pony swept on in a spurt of nerve-racking speed, but alone. By-and-by  shrieked again and crashed heavily to the ground, where he rolled  inertly and then lay still. Men like Buck are dangerous until their  hearts have ceased to beat.        CHAPTER VI. Trials of the Convalescent      The days at the ranch passed in irritating idleness for those who  had obstructed the flight of hostile lead, and worse than any of the  patients was Hopalong, who fretted and fumed at his helplessness, which  retarded his recovery. But at last the day came when he was fit for  the saddle again, and he gave notice of his joy in whoops and forthwith  announced that he was entitled to a holiday; and Buck had not the heart  to refuse him.    So he started forth in his quest of peace and pleasure, but instead had  found only trouble and had been forced to leave his card at almost every  place he had visited.    There was that affair in Red Hot Gulch, Colorado, where, under pressure,  he had invested sundry pieces of lead in the persons of several  obstreperous citizens and then had paced the zealous and excitable  sheriff to the state line.    He next was noticed in Cheyenne, where his deformity was vividly  dwelt upon, to the extent of six words, by one Tarantula Charley, the  aforesaid Charley not being able to proceed to greater length on account  of heart failure. As Charley had been a ubiquitous nuisance, those  present availed themselves of the opportunity offered by Hopalong to  indulge in a free drink.    Laramie was his next stopping place, and shortly after his arrival he  was requested to sing and dance by a local terror, who informed all  present that he was the only seventeen-buttoned rattlesnake in the cow  country. Hopalong, hurt and indignant at being treated like a common  tenderfoot, promptly knocked the terror down. After he had irrigated  several square feet of parched throats belonging to the audience he  again took up his journey and spent a day at Denver, where he managed to  avoid any further trouble.    Santa Fe loomed up before him several days later and he entered it  shortly before noon. At this time the old Spanish city was a bundle of  high-strung nerves, and certain parts of it were calculated to furnish  any and all kinds of excitement except revival meetings and church  fairs. Hopalong straddled a lively nerve before he had been in the city  an hour. Two local bad men, Slim Travennes and Tex Ewalt, desiring to  establish the fact that they were roaring prairie fires, attempted to  consume the placid and innocent stranger as he limped across the plaza  in search of a game of draw poker at the Black Hills Emporium, with the  result that they needed repairs, to the chagrin and disgust of their  immediate acquaintances, who endeavored to drown their mortification  and sorrow in rapid but somewhat wild gun play, and soon remembered that  they had pressing engagements elsewhere.    Hopalong reloaded his guns and proceeded to the Emporium, where he found  a game all prepared for him in every sense of the word. On the third  deal he objected to the way in which the dealer manipulated the cards,  and when the smoke cleared away he was the only occupant of the room,  except a dog belonging to the bartender that had intercepted a stray  bullet.    Hunting up the owner of the hound, he apologized for being the indirect  cause of the animal's death, deposited a sum of Mexican dollars in  that gentleman's palm and went on his way to Alameda, which he entered  shortly after dark, and where an insult, simmering in its uncalled-for  venom, met him as he limped across the floor of the local dispensary on  his way to the bar. There was no time for verbal argument and precedent  had established the manner of his reply, and his repartee was as quick  as light and most effective. Having resented the epithets he gave his  attention to the occupants of the room.    Smoke drifted over the table in an agitated cloud and dribbled lazily  upward from the muzzle of his six-shooter, while he looked searchingly  at those around him. Strained and eager faces peered at his opponent,  who was sliding slowly forward in his chair, and for the length of a  minute no sound but the guarded breathing of the onlookers could be  heard. This was broken by a nervous cough from the rear of the room, and  the faces assumed their ordinary nonchalant expressions, their rugged  lines heavily shadowed in the light of the flickering oil lamps, while  the shuffling of cards and the clink of silver became audible. Hopalong  Cassidy had objected to insulting remarks about his affliction.    Hopalong was very sensitive about his crippled leg and was always  prompt to resent any scorn or curiosity directed at it, especially  when emanating from strangers. A young man of twenty-three years, when  surrounded by nearly perfect specimens of physical manhood, is apt to  be painfully self-conscious of any such defect, and it reacted on his  nature at times, even though he was well-known for his happy-go-lucky  disposition and playfulness. He consoled himself with the knowledge  that what he lost in symmetry was more than balanced by the celerity  and certainty of his gun hand, which was right or left, or both, as the  occasion demanded.    Several hours later, as his luck was vacillating, he felt a heavy hand  on his shoulder, and was overjoyed at seeing Buck and Red, the latter  grinning as only Red could grin, and he withdrew from the game to enjoy  his good fortune.    While Hopalong had been wandering over the country the two friends had  been hunting for him and had traced him successfully, that being due  to the trail he had blazed with his six-shooters. This they had  accomplished without harm to themselves, as those of whom they inquired  thought that they must want Hopalong \"bad,\" and cheerfully gave the  information required.    They had started out more for the purpose of accompanying him for  pleasure, but that had changed to an urgent necessity in the following  manner:    While on the way from Denver to Santa Fe they had met Pete Willis of the  Three Triangle, a ranch that adjoined their own, and they paused to pass  the compliments of the season.    \"Purty far from th' grub wagon, Pie,\" remarked Buck.    \"Oh, I'm only goin' to Denver,\" responded Pie.    \"Purty hot,\" suggested Red.    \"She shore is. Seen anybody yu knows?\" Pie asked.    \"One or two--Billy of th' Star Crescent an' Panhandle Lukins,\" answered  Buck.    \"That so? Panhandle's goin' to punch for us next year. I'll hunt him up.  I heard down south of Albuquerque that Thirsty Jones an' his brothers  are lookin' for trouble,\" offered Pie.    \"Yah! They ain't lookin' for no trouble--they just goes around  blowin' off. Trouble? Why, they don't know what she is,\" remarked Red  contemptuously.    \"Well, they's been dodgin' th' sheriff purty lively lately, an' if that  ain't trouble I don't know what is,\" said Pie.    \"It shore is, an' hard to dodge,\" acquiesced Buck.    \"Well, I has to amble. Is Panhandle in Denver? Yes? I calculates as  how me an' him'll buck th' tiger for a whirl--he's shore lucky. Well, so  long,\" said Pie as he moved on.    \"So long,\" responded the two.    \"Hey, wait a minute,\" yelled Pie after he had ridden a hundred yards.  \"If yu sees Hopalong yu might tell him that th' Joneses are goin' to  hunt him up when they gits to Albuquerque. They's shore sore on him.  'Tain't none of my funeral, only they ain't always a-carin' how they  goes after a feller. So long,\" and soon he was a cloud of dust on the  horizon.    \"Trouble!\" snorted Red; \"well, between dodgin' Harris an' huntin'  Hopalong I reckons they'll shore find her.\" Then to himself he murmured,  \"Funny how everythin' comes his way.\"    \"That's gospel shore enough, but, as Pie said, they ain't a whole lot  particular as how they deal th' cards. We better get a move on an' find  that ornery little cuss,\" replied Buck.    \"O. K., only I ain't losin' no sleep about Hoppy. His gun's too lively  for me to do any worryin',\" asserted Red.    \"They'll get lynched some time, shore,\" declared Buck.    \"Not if they find Hoppy,\" grimly replied Red.    They tore through Santa Fe, only stopping long enough to wet their  throats, and after several hours of hard riding entered Alameda, where  they found Hopalong in the manner narrated.    After some time the three left the room and headed for Albuquerque,  twelve miles to the south. At ten o'clock they dismounted before the  Nugget and Rope, an unpainted wooden building supposed to be a  clever combination of barroom, dance and gambling hall and hotel. The  cleverness lay in the man who could find the hotel part.        CHAPTER VII. The Open Door      The proprietor of the Nugget and Rope, a German named Baum, not being  troubled with police rules, kept the door wide open for the purpose  of inviting trade, a proceeding not to the liking of his patrons for  obvious reasons. Probably not one man in ten was fortunate enough to  have no one \"looking for him,\" and the lighted interior assured good  hunting to any one in the dark street. He was continually opening the  door, which every newcomer promptly and forcibly slammed shut. When he  saw men walk across the room for the express purpose of slamming it he  began to cherish the idea that there was a conspiracy on foot to anger  him and thus force him to bring about his own death.    After the door had been slammed three times in one evening by one man,  the last slam being so forcible as to shake two bottles from the shelf  and to crack the door itself, he became positive that his suspicions  were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25502"],[0,"Hero-Myths & Legends of the British Race (#9)"],[1,"hilt, wrought with curious  ornaments and signs of old time. This hilt and Grendel's head were all  that Beowulf carried off from the water-fiends' dwelling; and laden  with these the hero sprang up through the now clear and sparkling  water.    [Illustration: Beowulf shears off the head of Grendel]    Meanwhile the Danes and Geats had waited long for his reappearance.  When the afternoon was well advanced the Danes departed sadly,  lamenting the hero's death, for they concluded no man could have  survived so long beneath the waters; but his loyal Geats sat there  still gazing sadly at the waves, and hoping against all hope that  Beowulf would reappear. At length they saw changes in the mere--the  blood boiling upwards in the lake, the quenching of the unholy light,  then the flight of the sea-monsters and a gradual clearing of the  waters, through which at last they could see their lord uprising. How  gladly they greeted him! What awe and wonder seized them as they  surveyed his dreadful booty, the ghastly head of Grendel and the  massive hilt of the gigantic sword! How eagerly they listened to his  story, and how they vied with one another for the glory of bearing his  armour, his spoils, and his weapons back over the moorlands and the  fens to Heorot. It was a proud and glad troop that followed Beowulf  into the hall, and up through the startled throng until they laid down  before the feet of King Hrothgar the hideous head of his dead foe, and  Beowulf, raising his voice that all might hear above the buzz and hum  of the great banquet-hall, thus addressed the king:        \"Lo! we this sea-booty,    O wise son of Healfdene,      Lord of the Scyldings, have    brought for thy pleasure,      In token of triumph,    as thou here seest.      From harm have I hardly    escaped with my life,      The war under water    sustained I with trouble,      The conflict was almost    decided against me,      If God had not guarded me!    Nought could I conquer      With Hrunting in battle,    though 'tis a doughty blade.      But the gods granted me    that I saw suddenly      Hanging high in the hall    a bright brand gigantic:      So seized I and swung it    that in the strife I slew      The lords of the dwelling.    The mighty blade melted fast      In the hot boiling blood,    the poisonous battle-gore;      But the hilt have I here    borne from the hostile hall.      I have avenged the crime,    the death of the Danish folk,      As it behoved me.    Now can I promise thee      That thou in Heorot    care-free mayest slumber      With all thy warrior-troop    and all thy kindred thanes,      The young and the aged:    thou needst not fear for them      Death from these mortal foes,    as thou of yore hast done.\"    King Hrothgar was now more delighted than ever at the return of his  friend and the slaughter of his foes. He gazed in delight and wonder  at the gory head of the monster, and the gigantic hilt of the weapon  which struck it off. Then, taking the glorious hilt, and scanning  eagerly the runes which showed its history, as the tumult stilled in  the hall, and all men listened for his speech, he broke out: \"Lo! this  may any man say, who maintains truth and right among his people, that  good though he may be this hero is even better! Thy glory is  widespread, Beowulf my friend, among thine own and many other nations,  for thou hast fulfilled all things by patience and prudence. I will  surely perform what I promised thee, as we agreed before; and I  foretell of thee that thou wilt be long a help and protection to thy  people.\"    King Hrothgar spoke long and eloquently while all men listened, for he  reminded them of mighty warriors of old who had not won such glorious  fame, and warned them against pride and lack of generosity and  self-seeking; and then, ending with thanks and fresh gifts to Beowulf,  he bade the feast continue with increased jubilation. The tumultuous  rejoicing lasted till darkness settled on the land, and when it ended  all retired to rest free from fear, since no more fiendish monsters  would break in upon their slumbers; gladly and peacefully the night  passed, and with the morn came Beowulf's resolve to return to his king  and his native land.    When Beowulf had come to this decision he went to Hrothgar and said:        \"Now we sea-voyagers    come hither from afar      Must utter our intent    to seek King Hygelac.      Here were we well received,    well hast thou treated us.      If on this earth I can    do more to win thy love,      O prince of warriors,    than I have wrought as yet,      Here stand I ready now    weapons to wield for thee.      If I shall ever hear    o'er the encircling flood      That any neighbouring foes    threaten thy nation's fall,      As Grendel grim before,    swift will I bring to thee      Thousands of noble thanes,    heroes to help thee.      I know of Hygelac,    King of the Geat folk,      That he will strengthen me    (though he is young in years)      In words and warlike deeds    to bear my warrior-spear      Over the ocean surge,    when arms would serve thy need,      Swift to thine aid.    If thy son Hrethric young      Comes to the Geat court,    there to gain skill in arms,      Then will he surely find    many friends waiting him:      Better in distant lands    learneth by journeying      He who is valiant.\"    Hrothgar was greatly moved by the words of the Geat hero and his  promise of future help. He wondered to find such wisdom in so young a  warrior, and felt that the Geats could never choose a better king if  battle should cut off the son of Hygelac, and he renewed his assurance  of continual friendship between the two countries and of enduring  personal affection. Finally, with fresh gifts of treasure and with  tears of regret Hrothgar embraced Beowulf and bade him go speedily to  his ship, since a friend's yearning could not retain him longer from  his native land. So the little troop of Geats with their gifts and  treasures marched proudly to their vessel and sailed away to Geatland,  their dragon-prowed ship laden with armour and jewels and steeds,  tokens of remembrance and thanks from the grateful Danes.      Beowulf's Return    Blithe-hearted were the voyagers, and gaily the ship danced over the  waves, as the Geats strained their eyes towards the cliffs of their  home and the well-known shores of their country. When their vessel  approached the land the coast-warden came hurrying to greet them, for  he had watched the ocean day and night for the return of the valiant  wanderers. Gladly he welcomed them, and bade his underlings help to  bear their spoils up to the royal palace, where King Hygelac, himself  young and valiant, awaited his victorious kinsman, with his beauteous  queen, Hygd, beside him. Then came Beowulf, treading proudly the rocky  paths to the royal abode, for messengers had gone in advance to  announce to the king his nephew's success, and a banquet was being  prepared, where Beowulf would sit beside his royal kinsman.    Once more there was a splendid feast, with tumultuous rejoicing. Again  a queenly hand--that of the beauteous Hygd--poured out the first bowl  in which to celebrate the safe return of the victorious hero. And now  the wonderful story of the slaying of the fen-fiends must be told.    Beowulf was called upon to describe again his perils and his  victories, and told in glowing language of the grisly monsters and the  desperate combats, and of the boundless gratitude and splendid  generosity of the Danish king, and of his prophecy of lasting  friendship between the Danes and the Geats. Then he concluded:        \"Thus that great nation's king    lived in all noble deeds.      Of guerdon I failed not,    of meed for my valour,      But the wise son of Healfdene    gave to me treasures great,      Gifts to my heart's desire.    These now I bring to thee,      Offer them lovingly:    now are my loyalty      And service due to thee,    O hero-king, alone!      Near kinsmen have I few    but thee, O Hygelac!\"    As the hero showed the treasures with which Hrothgar had rewarded his  courage, he distributed them generously among his kinsmen and friends,  giving his priceless jewelled collar to Queen Hygd, and his best steed  to King Hygelac, as a true vassal and kinsman should. So Beowulf  resumed his place as Hygelac's chief warrior and champion, and settled  down among his own people.      Fifty Years After    When half a century had passed away, great and sorrowful changes had  taken place in the two kingdoms of Denmark and Geatland. Hrothgar was  dead, and had been succeeded by his son Hrethric, and Hygelac had been  slain in a warlike expedition against the Hetware. In this expedition  Beowulf had accompanied Hygelac, and had done all a warrior could do  to save his kinsman and his king. When he saw his master slain he had  fought his way through the encircling foes to the sea-shore, where,  though sorely wounded, he flung himself into the sea and swam back to  Geatland. There he had told Queen Hygd of the untimely death of her  husband, and had called on her to assume the regency of the kingdom  for her young son Heardred. Queen Hygd called an assembly of the  Geats, and there, with the full consent of the nation, offered the  crown to Beowulf, the wisest counsellor and bravest hero among them;  but he refused to accept it, and so swayed the Geats by his eloquence  and his loyalty that they unanimously raised Heardred to the throne,  with Beowulf as his guardian and protector. When in later years  Heardred also fell before an enemy, Beowulf was again chosen king, and  as he was now the next of kin he accepted the throne, and ruled long  and gloriously over Geatland. His fame as a warrior kept his country  free from invasion, and his wisdom as a statesman increased its  prosperity and happiness; whilst the vengeance he took for his  kinsman's death fulfilled all ideals of family and feudal"]]]
