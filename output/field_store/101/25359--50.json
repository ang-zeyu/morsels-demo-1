Yet even in the case of the spiders,  the female spider already gives proof of a certain capacity for  sacrifice where her young are concerned, at any rate for a short time  after they have crept from the egg.    In animals somewhat higher in the creative scale, more or less  powerful feelings of affection may develop out of their sex  association. There is affection on the part of the male for his mate,  and on the part of the female for her young. Often these feelings  develop into a strong, lasting affection between the sexes, and years  of what might be called faithful matrimonial union have been observed  in the case of birds. This in itself is sufficient to establish the  intimate relationship between love in a sex sense and love in a  general sense. And even in the animal creation we find the same  analogy existing between these feelings of sympathy and their  opposites which occur in the case of human beings. Every feeling of  attachment or sympathy existing between two individuals has a  counterpart in an opposite feeling of discontent when the object of  the love or attachment in question dies, falls sick, or runs away.  This feeling of discontent may assume the form of a sorrow ending in  lasting melancholy. In the case of apes and of certain parrots, it has  been noticed that the death of a mate has frequently led the survivor  to refuse nourishment, and die in turn from increasing grief and  depression. If, on the other hand, an animal discovers the cause of  the grief or loss which threatens it; if some enemy creature tries to  rob it of its mate or little ones, the mixed reactive feeling of rage  or anger is born in it, anger against the originator of its  discontent. Jealousy is only a definite special form of this anger  reaction.    A further development of the feeling of sympathy is that of duty.  Every feeling of love or sympathy urges those who feel it to do  certain things which will benefit the object of that love. A mother  will feed her young, bed them down comfortably, caress them; a father  will bring nourishment to the mother and her brood, and protect them  against foes. All these actions, not performed to benefit the creature  itself, but to help its beloved mate, represent exertion, trouble, the  overcoming of danger, and lead to a struggle between egoism and the  feeling of sympathy. Out of this struggle is born a third feeling,  that of responsibility and conscience. Thus the elements of the human  social feelings are already quite pronounced in the case of many  animals, including those of love as well as sex.    In the human animal, speaking in general, these feelings of sympathy  (love) and duty are strongly developed in the family connection; that  is, they are developed with special strength in those who are most  intimately united in sex life, in husband and wife and in children.  Consequently the feelings of sympathy or love which extend to larger  communal groups, such as more distant family connections, the tribe,  the community, those speaking the same tongue, the nation, are  relatively far weaker. Weakest of all, in all probability, is that  general human feeling which sees a brother in every other human being  and is conscious of the social duties owed him.    As regards man and wife, the relation of the actual sex instinct to  love is often a very complicated one. In the case of man the sex  feeling may, and frequently does exist independent of love in the  higher sense; in the case of woman it is quite certain that love  occurs far less seldom unaccompanied by the sex inclination. It is  also quite possible for love to develop before the development of the  sex feeling, and this often, in married life, leads to the happiest  relationships.    The mutual adoration of two individuals, husband and wife, often  degenerates into a species of egoistic enmity toward the remainder of  the world. And this, in turn, in many cases reacts unfavorably upon  the love the two feel for each other. Human solidarity, especially in  this day, is already too great not to revenge itself upon the  egotistical character of so exclusive a love. The real ideal of sex in  love might be expressed as follows: A man and a woman should be  induced to unite in marriage through genuine sex attraction and  harmony of character and disposition. In this union they should  mutually encourage each other to labor socially for the common good of  mankind, in such wise that _they further their own mutual education  and that of their children_, the beings nearest and dearest to them,  _as the natural point of departure for helping general human  betterment_.    If love in its relation to sex be conceived in this manner, it will  purify it by doing away with its pettinesses and it is just into these  pettinesses that the most honest and upright of matrimonial loves too  often degenerate. The constructive work done in common by two human  beings who, while they care lovingly for each other, at the same time  encourage each other to strive and endure in carrying out the  principles of right living and high thinking, will last. Love and  marriage looked at from this point of view, are relatively immune from  the small jealousies and other evil little developments of a  one-sided, purely physical affection. It will work for an ever more  ideal realization of love in its higher and nobler dispensations.    Real and true love is lasting. The suddenly awakened storm of sex  affection for a hitherto totally unknown person can never be accepted  as a true measure for love. This sudden surge of the sex feeling warps  the judgment, makes it possible to overlook the grossest defects,  colors all and everything with heavenly hues. It makes a man who is  \"in love,\" or two beings who are in love, mutually blind, and causes  each to carefully conceal his or her real inward self from the other.  This may be the case even when the feelings of both are absolutely  honest, especially if the sex feeling is not paired with cool egoistic  calculation. Not until the first storm of the sex feeling has  subsided, when honeymoon weeks are over, is a more normal point of  view regained. And then love, indifference, or hatred, as the case may  be develops. It is for this reason that love at first sight is always  dangerous, and that only a longer and more intimate acquaintance with  the object of one's affection is calculated to give a lasting union a  relatively good chance of turning out happily. One thing is worth  bearing in mind. Woman invariably represents the conservative element  in the family. Her emotional qualities, combined with wonderful  endurance, always control her intellect more powerfully than is the  case with man; and the feelings and emotions form the conservative  element in the human soul."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23691"],[0,"Archeological Expedition to Arizona in 1895 (#9)"],[1,"Head, it winds up a steep hill of lava or malpais to  the top of the Mogollones. If, instead of ascending this hill, one  turns to the left, taking an obscure road across the river bed,  which is full of rough lava blocks, and in June, when I traveled its  course, was without water, he soon finds himself penetrating a rugged  country with bright-red cliffs on his right (plate XCVIII). Continuing  through great parks and plains he finally descends to the well-wooded  valley of Oak creek, an affluent of Rio Verde. Here he finds evidences  of aboriginal occupancy on all sides--ruins of buildings, fortified  hilltops, pictographs, and irrigating ditches--testifying that there  was at one time a considerable population in this valley. The fields  of the ancient inhabitants have now given place to many excellent  ranches, one of the most flourishing of which is not far from a lofty  butte of red rock called the Court-house, which from its great size is  a conspicuous object for miles around. In many of these canyons there  are evidences of a former population, but the country is as yet almost  unexplored; there are many difficult places to pass, yet once near the  base of the rocks a way can be picked from the mouth of one canyon to  another. It does not take long to discover that this now uninhabited  region contains, like that along the Verde and its tributaries, many  ancient dwellings, for there is scarcely a single canyon leading into  these red cliffs in which evidences of former human habitations are  not found in the form of ruins. There is little doubt that these  unfrequented canyons have many and extensive cliff houses, the  existence of which has thus far escaped the explorer. The sandstone of  which they are composed is much eroded into caves with overhanging  roofs, forming admirable sites for cliff houses as distinguished from  cavate dwellings like those we have described. They are the only  described ruins of a type hitherto thought to be unrepresented in the  valley of the Verde.[23]    In our excursion into the Red-rock country we were obliged to make our  own wagon road, as no vehicle had ever penetrated the rugged canyons  visited by us. It was necessary to carry our drinking water with us  from Oak creek, which fact impeded our progress and limited the time  available in our reconnoissance. There was, however, in the pool near  the ruins of Honanki enough water for our horses, and at the time we  were there a limited amount of grass for fodder was found. I was told  that later in the season both forage and water are abundant, so that  these prime necessities being met, there is no reason why successful  archeological investigations may not be successfully conducted in this  part of the Verde region.    The limited population of this portion of the country rendered it  difficult to get laborers at the time I made my reconnoissance, so  that it would be advisable for one who expects to excavate the ruins  in this region to take with him workmen from the settled portions of  the valley.      RUINS NEAR SCHUeRMANN'S RANCH    The valley of Oak creek, near Court-house butte, especially in the  vicinity of Schuermann's ranch, is dotted with fortifications, mounds  indicative of ruins, and like evidences of aboriginal occupancy. There  is undoubted proof that the former occupants of this plain constructed  elaborate irrigating ditches, and that the waters of Oak creek were  diverted from the stream and conducted over the adjoining valleys.  There are several fortified hills in this locality. One of the best of  these defensive works crowned a symmetrical mountain near Schuermann's  house. The top of this mesa is practically inaccessible from any but  the southern side, and was found to have a flat surface covered with  scattered cacti and scrub cedar, among which were walls of houses  nowhere rising more than two feet. The summit is perhaps 200 feet  above the valley, and the ground plan of the former habitations  extends over an area 100 feet in length, practically occupying the  whole of the summit. Although fragments of pottery are scarce, and  other evidences of long habitation difficult to find, the house walls  give every evidence of being extremely ancient, and most of the rooms  are filled with red soil out of which grow trees of considerable age.    Descending from this ruin-capped mesa, I noticed on the first terrace  the remains of a roundhouse, or lookout, in the middle of which a  cedar tree had taken root and was growing vigorously. Although the  walls of this structure do not rise above the level of the ground,  there is no doubt that they are the remains of either a lookout or  circular tower formerly situated at this point.    Many similar ruins are found throughout this vicinity, yet but little  more is known of them than that they antedate the advent of white men.  The majority of them were defensive works, built by the house  dwellers, and their frequency would indicate either considerable  population or long occupancy. Although many of those on the hilltops  differ somewhat from the habitations in the valleys, I think there is  little doubt that both were built by the same people.[24] There are  likewise many caves in this region, which seem to have been camping  places, for their walls are covered with soot and their floors strewn  with charred mescal, evidences, probably, of Apache occupancy. This  whole section of country was a stronghold of this ferocious tribe  within the last few decades, which may account for the modern  appearance of many of the evidences of aboriginal habitation.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XCVI    RUIN ON THE BRINK OF MONTEZUMA WELL]    There are some good pictographs on the foundation rocks of that great  pinnacle of red rock, called the Court-house, not far from Schuermann's  ranch.[25] Some of these are Apache productions, and the neighboring  caves evidently formed shelters for these nomads, as ash pit and  half-burnt logs would seem to show. This whole land was a stronghold  of the Apache up to a recent date, and from it they were dislodged,  many of the Indians being killed or removed by authority of the  Government.    From the geological character of the Red-rocks I was led to suspect  that cavate dwellings were not to be expected. The stone is hard and  not readily excavated by the rude implements with which the aborigines  of the region were supplied. But the remarkable erosion shown in this  rock elsewhere had formed many deep caverns or caves, with  overreaching roofs, very favorable for the sites of cliff houses. My  hurried examination confirmed my surmises, for we here found dwellings  of this kind, so similar to the type best illustrated in Mancos canyon  of southern Colorado. There were several smoke-blackened caves without  walls of masonry, but with floors strewn with charred wood, showing  Apache occupancy. No cavate dwellings were found in the section of the  Red-rocks visited by our party.    The two largest of the Red-rock cliff houses to which I shall refer  were named Honanki or Bear-house and Palatki or Red-house. The former  of these, as I learned from the names scribbled on its walls, had  previously been visited by white men, but so far as I know it has  never been mentioned in archeological literature. My attention was  called to it by Mr Schuermann, at whose hospitable ranch I outfitted  for my reconnoissance into the Red-rock country. The smaller ruin,  Palatki, we discovered by chance during our visit, and while it is  possible that some vaquero in search of a wild steer may have visited  the neighborhood before us, there is every reason to believe that the  ruin had escaped even the notice of these persons, and, like Honanki,  was unknown to the archeologist.    The two ruins, Honanki and Palatki, are not the only ones in the lone  canyon where we encamped. Following the canyon a short distance from  its entrance, there was found to open into it from the left a  tributary, or so-called box canyon, the walls of which are very  precipitous. Perched on ledges of the cliffs there are several rows of  fortifications or walls of masonry extending for many yards. It was  impossible for us to enter these works, even after we had clambered up  the side of the precipice to their level, so inaccessible were they to  our approach. These \"forts\" were probably for refuge, but they are ill  adapted as points of observation on account of the configuration of  the canyon. Their masonry, as examined at a distance with a field  glass, resembles that of Palatki and Honanki.    I was impressed by the close resemblance between the large cliff  houses of the Red-rocks, with their overhanging roof of rock, and  those of the San Juan and its tributaries in northern New Mexico.  While it is recognized that cliff houses have been reported from Verde  valley, I find them nowhere described, and our lack of information  about them, so far as they are concerned, may have justified  Nordenskioeld's belief that \"the basin of the Colorado actually  contains almost all the cliff dwellings of the United States.\" As the  Gila flows into the Colorado near its mouth, the Red-rock ruins may in  a sense be included in the Colorado basin, but there are many and  beautiful cliff houses higher up near the sources of the Gila and its  tributary, the Salt. In calling attention to the characteristic cliff  dwellings of the Red-rocks I am making known a new region of ruins  closely related to those of Canyon de Tsegi, or Chelly, the San Juan  and its tributaries.    Although the cliff houses of Verde valley had been known for many  years, and the ruins here described are of the same general character,  anyone who examines Casa Montezuma, on Beaver creek, and compares it  with Honanki, will note differences of an adaptive nature. The one  feature common to Honanki and the \"Cliff Palace\" of Mancos canyon is  the "]]]
