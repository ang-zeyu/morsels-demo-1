In the  cold weather, the canal takes such a heavy toll from it that below  Madhopur the supply of water is mainly drawn from the Ujh, and in  Montgomery one may cross the bed dryshod for months together. The valley  of the Ravi is far narrower than those of the rivers described in the  preceding paragraphs, and the floods are most uncertain, but when they  occur are of very great value.    [Illustration: Fig. 15. Bias at Manali.]    ~The Bias.~--The Bias (Sanskrit, Vipasa; Greek, Hyphasis) rises near the  Rotang pass at a height of about 13,000 feet. Its head-waters are  divided from those of the Ravi by the Bara Bangahal range. It flows for  about sixty miles through the beautiful Kulu valley to Larji (3000  feet). It has at first a rapid course, but before it reaches Sultanpur  (4000 feet), the chief village in Kulu, some thirty miles from the  source, it has become, at least in the cold weather, a comparatively  peaceful stream fringed with alder thickets. Heavy floods, however,  sometimes cover fields and orchards with sand and boulders. There is a  bridge at Manali (6100 feet), a very lovely spot, another below Nagar,  and a third at Larji. Near Larji the river turns to the west down a bold  ravine and becomes for a time the boundary between Kulu and the Mandi  State. Near the town of Mandi, where it is bridged, it bends again, and  winds in a north-west and westerly direction through low hills in the  south of Kangra till it meets the Siwaliks on the Hoshyarpur border. In  this reach there is a bridge of boats at Dera Gopipur on the main road  from Jalandhar and Hoshyarpur to Dharmsala. Elsewhere in the south of  Kangra the traveller can cross without difficulty on a small bed  supported on inflated skins. Sweeping round the northern end of the  Siwaliks the Bias, having after long parting again approached within  about fifteen miles of the Ravi, turns definitely to the south, forming  henceforth the dividing line between Hoshyarpur and Kapurthala (left  bank) and Gurdaspur and Amritsar (right). Finally above the Harike ferry  at a point where Lahore, Amritsar, Ferozepur, and Kapurthala nearly  meet, it falls into the Sutlej. The North Western Railway crosses it by  a bridge near the Bias station and at the same place there is a bridge  of boats for the traffic on the Grand Trunk Road. The chief affluents  are the Chakki, the torrent which travellers to Dharmsala cross by a  fine bridge twelve miles from the railhead at Pathankot, and the Black  Bein in Hoshyarpur and Kapurthala. The latter is a winding drainage  channel, which starts in a swamp in the north of the Hoshyarpur  district. The Bias has a total course of 390 miles. Only for about  eighty miles or so is it a true river of the plains, and its floods do  not spread far.    ~The Sutlej.~--The Sutlej is the Shatadru of Vedic hymns and the Zaradros  of Greek writers. The peasant of the Panjab plains knows it as the Nili  or Ghara. After the Indus it is the greatest of Panjab rivers, and for  its source we have to go back to the Manasarowar lakes in Tibet. From  thence it flows for 200 miles in a north-westerly direction to the  British frontier near Shipki. A little beyond the Spiti river brings it  the drainage of the large tract of that name in Kangra and of part of  Western Tibet. From Shipki it runs for forty miles in deep gorges  through Kunawar in the Bashahr State to Chini, a beautiful spot near the  Wangtu bridge, where the Hindustan-Tibet road crosses to the left bank.  A little below Chini the Baspa flows in from the southeast. The fall  between the source and Chini is from 15,000 to 7500 feet. There is  magnificent cliff scenery at Rogi in this reach. Forty miles below Chini  the capital of Bashahr, Rampur, on the south bank, is only 3300 feet  above sea level. There is a second bridge at Rampur, and from about this  point the river becomes the boundary of Bashahr and Kulu, the route to  which from Simla passes over the Luri bridge (2650 feet) below Narkanda.  Beyond Luri the Sutlej runs among low hills through several of the Simla  Hill States. It pierces the Siwaliks at the Hoshyarpur border and then  turns to the south, maintaining that trend till Rupar and the head-works  of the Sirhind canal are reached. For the next hundred miles to the Bias  junction the general direction is west. Above the Harike ferry the  Sutlej again turns, and flows steadily, though with many windings, to  the south-west till it joins the Chenab at the south corner of the  Multan district. There are railway bridges at Phillaur, Ferozepur, and  Adamwahan. In the plains the Sutlej districts are--on the right bank  Hoshyarpur, Jalandhar, Lahore, and Montgomery, and on the left Ambala,  Ludhiana and Ferozepur. Below Ferozepur the river divides Montgomery and  Multan from Bahawalpur (left bank). The Sutle; has a course of 900  miles, and a large catchment area in the hills. Notwithstanding the  heavy toll taken by the Sirhind canal, its floods spread pretty far in  Jalandhar and Ludhiana and below the Bias junction many monsoon canals  have been dug which inundate a large area in the lowlands of the  districts on either bank and of Bahawalpur. The dry bed of the Hakra,  which can be traced through Bahawalpur, Bikaner, and Sindh, formerly  carried the waters of the Sutlej to the sea.    ~The Ghagar and the Sarusti.~--The Ghagar, once a tributary of the Hakra,  rises within the Sirmur State in the hills to the east of Kalka. A few  miles south of Kalka it crosses a narrow neck of the Ambala district,  and the bridge on the Ambala-Kalka railway is in this section. The rest  of its course, till it loses itself in the sands of Bikaner, is chiefly  in Patiala and the Karnal and Hissar districts. It is joined by the Umla  torrent in Karnal and lower down the Sarusti unites with it in Patiala  just beyond the Karnal border. It is hard to believe that the Sarusti of  to-day is the famous Sarasvati of the Vedas, though the little  ditch-like channel that bears the name certainly passes beside the  sacred sites of Thanesar and Pehowa. A small sandy torrent bearing the  same name rises in the low hills in the north-east of the Ambala  district, but it is doubtful if its waters, which finally disappear into  the ground, ever reach the Thanesar channel. That seems rather to  originate in the overflow of a rice swamp in the plains, and in the cold  weather the bed is usually dry. In fact, till the Sarusti receives above  Pehowa the floods of the Markanda torrent, it is a most insignificant  stream. The Markanda, when in flood, carries a large volume of water,  and below the junction the small channel of the Sarusti cannot carry the  tribute received, which spreads out into a shallow lake called the  Sainsa _jhil_. This has been utilized for the supply of the little  Sarusti canal, which is intended to do the work formerly effected in a  rude way by throwing _bands_ or embankments across the bed of the  stream, and forcing the water over the surrounding lands. The same  wasteful form of irrigation was used on a large scale on the Ghagar and  is still practised on its upper reaches. Lower down earthen _bands_ have  been superceded by a masonry weir at Otu in the Hissar district. The  northern and southern Ghagar canals, which irrigate lands in Hissar and  Bikaner, take off from this weir.    ~Action of Torrents.~--The Ghagar is large enough to exhibit all the three  stages which a _cho_ or torrent of intermittent flow passes through.  Such a stream begins in the hills with a well-defined boulder-strewn  bed, which is never dry. Reaching the plains the bed of a cho becomes a  wide expanse of white sand, hardly below the level of the adjoining  country, with a thread of water passing down it in the cold weather. But  from time to time in the rainy season the channel is full from bank to  bank and the waters spill far and wide over the fields. Sudden spates  sometimes sweep away men and cattle before they can get across. If, as  in Hoshyarpur, the _chos_ flow into a rich plain from hills composed of  friable sandstone and largely denuded of tree-growth, they are in their  second stage most destructive. After long delay an Act was passed in  1900, which gives the government large powers for the protection of  trees in the Siwaliks and the reclamation of torrent beds in the plains.  The process of recovery cannot be rapid, but a measure of success has  already been attained. It must not be supposed that the action of _chos_  in this second stage is uniformly bad. Some carry silt as well as sand,  and the very light loam which the great Markanda _cho_ has spread over  the country on its banks is worth much more to the farmer than the stiff  clay it has overlaid. Many _chos_ do not pass into the third stage, when  all the sand has been dropped, and the bed shrinks into a narrow  ditch-like channel with steep clay banks. The inundations of torrents  like the Degh and the Ghagar after this stage is reached convert the  soil into a stiff impervious clay, where flood-water will lie for weeks  without being absorbed into the soil. In Karnal the wretched and  fever-stricken tract between the Ghagar and the Sarusti known as the  Naili is of this character.    ~The Jamna.~--The Jamna is the Yamuna of Sanskrit writers. Ptolemy's and  Pliny's versions, Diamouna and Jomanes, do not deviate much from the  original. It rises in the Kumaon Himalaya, and, where it first meets the  frontier of the Simla Hill States, receives from the north a large  tributary called the Tons. Henceforth, speaking broadly, the Jamna is  the boundary of the Panjab and the United Provinces. On the Panjab bank  are from north to south the Sirmur State, Ambala, Karnal, Rohtak, Delhi,  and Gurgaon. The river leaves the Panjab where Gurgaon and the district  of Mathra, which belongs to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24583"],[0,"Langstroth on the Hive and the Honey-Bee: A Bee Keeper's Manual (#9)"],[1,"colony is too feeble to maintain  sufficient heat, a smaller number of eggs are developed in her ovaries,  just as unfavorable circumstances diminish the number of eggs laid by  the hen; if the weather is very cold, egg-laying usually ceases  altogether. In the latitude of Philadelphia, I opened one of my hives on  the 5th day of February, and found an abundance of eggs and brood,  although the winter had been an unusually cold one, and the temperature  of the preceding month very low. The fall of 1852 was a warm one, and  eggs and brood were found in a hive which I examined on the 21st of  October. Powerful stocks in well protected hives contain some brood, at  least ten months in the year; in warm countries, bees probably breed,  every month in the year.    It is highly interesting to see in what way the supernumerary eggs of  the queen are disposed of. When the number of workers is too small to  take charge of all her eggs, or when there is a deficiency of bee bread  to nourish the young, (See chapter on Pollen,) or when, for any reason,  she judges it not best to deposit them in cells, she stands upon a comb,  and simply extrudes them from her oviduct, and the workers devour them  as fast as they are laid! This I have repeatedly witnessed in my  observing hives, and admired the sagacity of the queen in economizing  her necessary work after this fashion, instead of laboriously depositing  the eggs in cells where they are not wanted. What a difference between  her wise management and the stupidity of a hen obstinately persisting to  set upon addled eggs, or pieces of chalk, and often upon nothing at all.    The workers eat up also all the eggs which are dropped, or deposited out  of place by the queen; in this way, nothing goes to waste, and even a  tiny egg is turned to some account. Was there ever a better comment upon  the maxim? \"Take care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of  themselves.\"    Do the workers who appear to be so fond of a tit-bit in the shape of a  new laid egg, ever experience a struggle between their appetites and the  claims of duty, and does it cost them some self denial to refrain from  making a breakfast on a fresh laid egg? It is really very difficult for  one who has carefully watched the habits of bees, to speak of his little  favorites in any other way than as though they possessed an intelligence  almost, if not quite, akin to reason.    It is well known to every breeder of poultry, that the fertility of a  hen decreases with age, until at length, she becomes entirely barren; it  is equally certain that the fertility of the queen bee ordinarily  diminishes after she has entered upon her third year. She sometimes  ceases to lay Worker eggs, a considerable time before she dies of old  age; the contents of the spermatheca are exhausted; the eggs can no  longer be impregnated and must therefore produce drones.    The queen bee usually dies of old age, some time in her fourth year,  although instances are on record of some having survived a year longer.  It is highly important to the bee keeper who would receive the largest  returns from his bees, to be able, as in my hives, to catch the queen  and remove her, when she has passed the period of her greatest  fertility. In the sequel, full directions will be given, as to the  proper time and mode of effecting it.    Before proceeding farther in the natural history of the queen bee, I  shall describe more particularly, the other inmates of the hive.      THE DRONES OR MALE BEES.    The drones are, unquestionably, the male bees. Dissection proves that  they have the appropriate organs of generation. They are much larger and  stouter than either the queen or workers; although their bodies are not  quite so long as that of the queen. They have no sting with which to  defend themselves; no proboscis which is suitable for gathering honey  from the flowers, and no baskets on their thighs for holding the  bee-bread. They are thus physically disqualified for work, even if they  were ever so well disposed to it. Their proper office is to impregnate  the young queens, and they are usually destroyed by the bees, soon after  this is completed.    Dr. Evans the author of a beautiful poem on bees thus appropriately  describes them:--                \"Their short proboscis sips      No luscious nectar from the wild thyme's lips,      From the lime's leaf no amber drops they steal,      Nor bear their grooveless thighs the foodful meal:      On other's toils in pamper'd leisure thrive      The lazy fathers of the industrious hive.\"    The drones begin to make their appearance in April or May; earlier or  later, according to climate and the forwardness of the season, and  strength of the stock. They require about twenty-four days for their  full development from the egg. In colonies which are too weak to swarm,  none, as a general rule, are reared: they are not needed, for in such  hives, as no young queens are raised, they would be only useless  consumers.    The number of drones in a hive is often very great, amounting, not  merely to hundreds, but sometimes to thousands. It seems, at first, very  difficult to understand why there should be so many, especially since it  has been ascertained that a single one will impregnate a queen for life.  But as intercourse always takes place high in the air, the young queens  are obliged to leave the hive for this purpose; and it is exceedingly  important to their safety, that they should be sure of finding one,  without being compelled to make frequent excursions. Being larger than a  worker, and less quick on the wing, they are more exposed to be caught  by birds, or blown down and destroyed by sudden gusts of wind.    In a large Apiary, a few drones in each hive, or the number usually  found in one, might be amply sufficient. But it must be borne in mind,  that under these circumstances, bees are not in a state of nature.  Before they were domesticated, a colony living in a forest, often had no  neighbors for miles. Now a good stock in our climate, sometimes sends  out three or more swarms, and in the tropical climates, of which the bee  is a native, they increase with astonishing rapidity. At Sydney, in  Australia, a single colony is stated to have multiplied to 300 in three  years. All the new swarms except the first, are led off by a young  queen, and as she is never impregnated until after she has been  established as the head of a separate family, it is important that they  should all be accompanied by a goodly number of drones; and this  renders it necessary that a large number should be produced in the  parent hive.    As this necessity no longer exists, when the bee is domesticated, the  production of so many drones should be discouraged. Traps have been  invented to destroy them, but it is much better to save the bees the  labor and expense of rearing such a host of useless consumers. This can  readily be done by the use of my hives. The cells in which the drones  are reared, are much larger than those appropriated to the raising of  workers. The combs containing them may be taken out, to have their  places supplied with worker's cells, and thus the over production of  drones may easily be prevented. Some colonies contain so much drone comb  as to be nearly worthless.    I have no doubt that some of my readers will object to this mode of  management as interfering with nature: but let them remember that the  bee is not in a state of nature, and that the same objection might be  urged against killing off the super-numerary males of our domestic  animals.    In July or August, soon after the swarming season is over, the bees  expel the drones from the hive. They sometimes sting them, and sometimes  gnaw the roots of their wings, so that when driven from the hive, they  cannot return. If not treated in either of these summary ways, they are  so persecuted and starved, that they soon perish. The hatred of the bees  extends even to the young which are still unhatched: they are  mercilessly pulled from the cells, and destroyed with the rest. How  wonderful that instinct which teaches the bees that there is no longer  any occasion for the services of the drones, and which impels them to  destroy those members of the colony, which, a short time before, they  reared with such devoted attention!    A colony which neglects to expel its drones at the usual season, ought  always to be examined. The queen is probably either diseased or dead. In  my hives, such an examination may be easily made, the true state of the  case ascertained, and the proper remedies at once applied. (See Chapter  on the Loss of the Queen.)      THE PRODUCTION OF SO MANY DRONES NECESSARY, IN A STATE OF NATURE, TO  PREVENT DEGENERACY FROM \"IN AND IN BREEDING.\"    I have often been able, by the reasons previously assigned, to account  for the necessity of such a large number of drones in a state of nature,  to the satisfaction of others, but never fully to my own. I have  repeatedly queried, why impregnation might not just as well have been  effected _in the hive_, as on the wing, in the open air. Two very  obvious and highly important advantages would have resulted from such an  arrangement. 1st. A few dozen drones would have amply sufficed for the  wants of any colony, even if, (as in tropical climates,) it swarmed half  a dozen times or oftener, in the same season. 2d. The young queens would  have been exposed to none of those risks which they now incur, in  leaving the hive for fecundation.    I was unable to show how the existing arrangement is best; although I  never doubted that there must be a satisfactory reason for this seeming  imperfection. To suppose otherwise, would be highly unphilosophical,  since we constantly see, as the circle of our knowledge is enlarged,  many mysteries in nature hitherto inexplicable, fully cleared up.    Let me here ask if the disposition which too many students of nature  cherish, to"]]]
