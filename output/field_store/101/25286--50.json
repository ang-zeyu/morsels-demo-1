CHAPTER VIII    IMITATION OF NATURAL FORMS           Difficulties of Selection and Arrangement--Limits of an Imitative       Treatment--Light and Distance Factors in the Arrangement of a       Design--Economy of Detail Necessary--The Word \"Conventional.\"      Broadly stated, the three most formidable difficulties which confront  the beginner when he sets out to make what he is pleased to call his  design for carving in relief, are: Firstly, the choice of a subject;  secondly, how far he may go in the imitation of its details; thirdly,  its arrangement as a whole when he has decided the first two points.    Just now we shall deal only with the second difficulty, that is, how far  may likeness to nature be carried. We shall do this, because until we  come to some understanding on that point, a right choice of subject  becomes practically impossible, consequently the consideration of its  arrangement would be premature.    There is, strictly speaking, only one aim worthy of the artist's  attention, be he carver or painter; and that is the representation of  some form of life, or its associations. Luckily, there is a mighty  consensus of opinion in support of this dictum, both by example and  precept, so there is no need to discuss it, or question its authority.  We shall proceed, therefore, to act upon it, and choose for our work  only such material as in some way indicates life, either directly, as in  trees, animals, or figures, or by association, and as explanation  thereof, as in drapery and other accessories--never choosing a subject  like those known to painters as \"still life,\" such as bowls, fiddles,  weapons, etc., unless, as I have said, they are associated with the more  important element.    You have already discovered by practise that wood has a grain which sets  bounds to the possibilities of technique. You have yet to learn that it  has also an inordinate capacity for swallowing light. Now, as it is by  the aid of light that we see the results of our labor, it follows that  we should do everything in our power to take full advantage of that  helpful agency. It is obvious that work which can not be seen is only so  much labor thrown away. There is approximately a right relative distance  from which to view all manner of carvings, and if from this position the  work is not both distinct and coherent, its result is valueless.    Then what is the quality which makes all the difference between a  telling piece of carving, and one which looks, at a moderate distance,  like crumpled paper or the cork bark which decorates a suburban  summer-house? The answer is, attention to _strict economy in detail_.  Without economy there can be no arrangement, and without the latter no  general effect. We are practically dealing, not with so much mere wood,  but unconsciously we are directing our efforts to a manipulation of the  light of day--playing with the lamps of the sky--and if we do not  understand this, the result must be undoubtedly failure, with a piece of  wood left on our hands, cut into unintelligible ruts.    But what, you will say, has all this to do with copying the infinite  variety of nature's detail; surely it can not be wrong to imitate what  is really beautiful in itself? You will find the best answer to this in  the technical difficulties of your task. You have the grain of the wood  to think of, and now you have this other difficulty in managing the  light which is to display your design. The obstinacy of the wood may be  to some extent conquered, and indeed has been almost entirely so, by the  technical resources of Grinling Gibbons, but the treatment demanded by  the laws of light and vision is quite another question, and if our work  is to have its due effect, there is no other solution of the problem  than by finding a way of complying with those laws.    If I want to represent a rose and make it intelligible at a glance from  such and such a point of view, and I find after taking infinite pains to  reproduce as many as I can of its numerous petals, and as much as  possible of its complicated foliage, that I had not reckoned with the  light which was to illuminate it, and that instead of displaying my work  to advantage, it has blurred all its delicate forms into dusky and  chaotic masses, would I not be foolish if I repeated such an experiment?  Rather, I take the opposite extreme, and produce a rose this time which  has but five petals, and one or two sprays of rudimentary foliage.  Somehow the result is better, and it has only taken me a tenth part of  the time to produce. I now find that I can afford, without offending the  genius of light, or straining my eyesight, to add a few more petals and  one or two extra leaves between those I have so sparingly designed, and  a kind of balance is struck. The same thing happens when I try to  represent a whole tree--I can not even count the leaves upon it, why  then attempt to carve them? Let me make one leaf that will stand for  fifty, and let that leaf be simplified until it is little more than an  abstract of the form I see in such thousandfold variety. The proof that  I am right this time is that when I stand at the proper distance to view  my work, it is all as distinct as I could wish it to be. Not a  leaf-point is quite lost to sight, except where, in vanishing into a  shadow, it adds mystery without creating confusion.    We have in this discovery a clue to the meaning of the word  \"Conventional\": it means that a particular method has been \"agreed upon\"  as the best fitted for its purpose, i.e., as showing the work to most  advantage with a minimum of labor. Not that experience had really  anything to do with the invention of the method. Strange to say, the  earliest efforts in carving were based upon an unquestioning sense that  no other was possible, certainly no attempts were made to change it  until in latter days temptations arose in various directions, the  effects of which have entailed upon ourselves a conscious effort of  choice in comparing the results of the many subsequent experiments.    Before I continue this subject further, I shall give you another  exercise, with the object of making a closer resemblance to natural  forms, bearing in mind the while all that has been said about a sparing  use of minute detail with reference to its visible effect. We shall in  this design attempt some shaping on the surface of the leaves and a  little rounding too, which may add interest to the work. In my next  lecture to you, I shall have something to say about another important  element in all designs for wood-carving. I mean the shapes taken by the  background between the leaves, like the patches of sky seen behind a  tree.          CHAPTER IX    ROUNDED FORMS           Necessity for Every Carver Making his own Designs--Method of       Carving Rounded Forms on a Sunk Ground.      [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    Fig. 16, our second exercise, like the first one, is only to be taken as  a suggestion for a design to be made by yourself. It is a fundamental  principle that both design and execution should be the work of one and  the same person, and I want you to begin by strictly practising this  rule. It was indeed one of the main conditions of production in the best  times of the past, and there is not a shadow of doubt that it must again  come to be the universal rule if any real progress is to be made in the  art of wood-carving, or in any other art for that matter. Just think  for a moment how false must be the position of both parties, when one  makes a \"design\" and another carries it out. The \"designer\" sets his  head to work (we must not count his hands at present, as they only note  down the results in a kind of writing), a \"design\" is produced and  handed over to the carver to execute. He, the carver, sets his hands and  eyes to work, to carry out the other man's idea, or at least interpret  his notes for the same, his head meanwhile having very little to do,  further than transfer the said notes to his hands. For very good reasons  such an arrangement as this is bound to come to grief. One is, that no  piece of carving can properly be said to be \"designed\" until it is  finished to the last stroke. A drawing is only a map of its general  outline, with perhaps contours approximately indicated by shading. In  any case, even if a full-size model were supplied by the designer, the  principle involved would suffer just the same degree of violence, for it  is in the actual carving of the wood that the designer should find both  his inspiration and the discipline which keeps it within reasonable  bounds. He must be at full liberty to alter his original intention as  the work develops under his hand.    Apparently I have been led into giving you another lecture; we must now  get to work on our exercise.    Draw and trace your outline in the same manner as before, and transfer  it to the wood. You may make it any convenient size, say on a board 18  ins. long by 9 ins. wide, or what other shape you like, provided you  observe one or two conditions which I am going to point out. It shall  have a fair amount of background between the features, and the design,  whatever it is, shall form a traceable likeness to a pattern of some  description; it shall have a rudimentary resemblance to nature, without  going into much detail; and last, it shall have a few _rounded_ forms in  it, rounded both in outline and on the surface, as, for instance, plums.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.]    In setting to work to carve this exercise, follow the same procedure as  in the first one, up to the point when the surface decorations began. In  the illustration, there is a suggestion for a variety in the background  which does not occur in the other. In this case the little branches are  supposed to lie along the tops of gentle elevations, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22108"],[0,"The Untroubled Mind (#9)"],[1,"h. The great human virtues will become easy and natural, the  untroubled mind, or as much of it as is good to possess, will be ours,  not because we have escaped trouble, but because we have disarmed it,  have welcomed it even, so long as it has served to strengthen and  ennoble our lives.          XI    THE CURE BY FAITH          The healing of his seamless dress      Is by our beds of pain--      We touch Him in life's throng and press,      And we are whole again.                  WHITTIER.    I cannot finish my little book of ideals without writing some things  that are in my mind about cure by faith or by prayer. It is a subject  that I approach with hesitation because of the danger of  misunderstanding. No subject is more difficult and none is more  important for the invalid to understand. We hear a great deal about the  wonderful cures of Christian Science or of similar agencies, and we all  know of people who have been restored to usefulness by such means. Has  the healing of Christ again become possible on earth? No one would be  more eager to accept it and acknowledge it than the physician if it  were really so. But careful investigation always reveals the fact that  the wonderful cures are not of the body but of the mind. It is easy  enough to say that a cancer or tuberculosis has been cured by faith, and  apparently easy for many people to believe it, but alas, the proof is  wanting. The Christian Scientist, honest and sincere as he may be, is  not qualified to say what is true disease and what is not. What looks  like diseased tissue recovers, but medical men know that it could not  have been diseased in the most serious sense, and that the prayer for  recovery could have had nothing to do with the cure, save in a very  indirect way.    The man who discards medicine for philosophy or religion is courting  unnecessary suffering and even death. The worst part of it is that he  may induce some one else to make the same mistake with similar results.  In writing this opinion I am in no way denying the great significance  and value of faith nor of the prayerful and trustful mind. If it cannot  cure actual physical disease, faith can accomplish veritable miracles of  healing in the mind of the patient. No thoughtful or honest medical man  will deny it. Nor will most medical men deny that the course of almost  any physical illness may be modified by faith and prayer. I am almost  saying that there is no known medicine of such potency. Every bodily  function is the better for the conquering spirit that transcends the  earth and finds its necessary expression in prayer.    There really need be no issue or disagreement between medicine and faith  cure. At its best, one is not more wonderful than the other, and both  aim to accomplish the same end--the relief of human suffering. When the  two are merged, as some day they will be, we shall be surprised to  discover how alike they are. Christian Science is rightly scorned by  medical men because it is unscientific, because it makes absurd and  untenable claims outside its own field, and because it has not as yet  investigated that field in the scientific spirit. When proper study and  investigation have been made it will be found that faith cure, not in  its present state, but in some future development, will have an immense  field of usefulness. It will be worthy of as much respect in that field  as medicine proper in its own sphere. As a matter of fact both medicine  and faith cure are miraculous in a very real sense, as both depend for  efficiency now and always upon the same great laws which may be fairly  called divine. What is the discovery that the serum of a horse will  under certain circumstances cure diphtheria? Does it not mean that man  is tapping sources of power far beyond his understanding? Is man  responsible save as the agent? Did he produce the complex animal  chemistry that makes this cure possible? Did man make the horse, or the  laws that control the physiology and pathology of that animal? Here,  then, is faith cure in its largest and best sense. The biologist may not  be willing to admit it, but his faith in these great laws of God have  made possible the cure of a dread disease. Here, as in all matters of  pure religion, it is what men say and write, not the fact itself, that  makes all the misunderstanding; we make our judgments and conceive our  prejudices from mere surface considerations. Call life what you  will,--leave out the symbolic word \"God\" altogether,--the facts remain.  The true scientific spirit must reverence and adore the power that lies  behind creation. It is as inconsistent for the bacteriologist to be an  unbeliever as it is for the Christian Scientist to deny the value of  bacteriology. Medicine is infinitely farther advanced than Christian  Science, and yet Christian Science has grasped some truth that the  natural scientist has stupidly missed. When an obsession is thrown off  and courage substituted for fear, we witness as important a \"cure\" as  can be shown to the credit of surgery. If the Christian Scientists and  the other faith-curers were only less superficial and less narrow in  their explanation of the facts, if they would condescend to study the  diseases they treat, they would be entitled to, and would receive, more  respect and consideration.    The cure and prevention of disease through the agency of man are  evidently part of the divine plan. Our eagerness to advance along the  lines of investigation and practice is but that divine plan in action.  The truly scientific spirit will neglect no possible curative agent.  When scientific men ridicule prayer, they are thinking not of the real  thing which is above all possible criticism, but of the feeble and often  pathetic groping for the real thing. We ask in our prayers for  impossible blessings that would invert the laws of God and change the  face of nature--very well, we must be prepared for disappointment. The  attitude of prayer may, indeed, transform our own lives and make  possible for us experiences that would otherwise have been impossible.  But our pathetic demands--we shall never know how forlorn and weak they  are. Prayer is the opening of the heart to the being we call God--it is  most natural and reasonable. If we pray in our weakness and blindness  for what we may not have, there is, nevertheless, a wonderful  re-creative effect within us. The comfort and peace of such communion is  beyond all else healing and restoring in its influence upon the troubled  and anxious mind of man. The poet or the scientist who bows in adoration  before the glory of God revealed in nature, prays in effect to that God  and his soul is refreshed and renewed. The poor wretch who stands  blindfolded before the firing squad, waiting the word that ends the life  of a military spy, is near enough to God--and the whispered prayer upon  his lips is cure for the wounds that take his life.    The best kind of prayer seeks not and asks not for physical relief or  benefit, but opens the heart to its maker, and so receives the cure of  peace that is a greater miracle than any yet wrought by man. Under the  influence of that cure the sick are well and the dead are alive again.  With the courage and spirit of such a cure in our lives, we shall  inevitably do our utmost to relieve, by any good means, the physical  suffering of the world. We shall follow the laws of nature. We shall  study them with the utmost care. We shall take nothing for granted,  since by less careful steps we shall miss the divine law and so go  astray. The science of healing will become no chance and irrational  thing. We shall use all the natural means to relieve and prevent  suffering--there will be no scoring of one set of doctors by another  because all will have one purpose. But more to the point than that, men  will discover that health in its largest sense consists in living devout  and prayerful lives whereunto shall be revealed in good time all that  our finite minds can know and use. There will be no suffering of the  body in the old and pitiful sense, for we shall be so much alive that  disease and death can no longer claim us."]]]
