Early next morning, after the hunters had reciprocated Macora's  hospitality by giving him the best breakfast they were capable of  cooking, they started off on their search for sea-cows.  Macora,  accompanied by four attendants, acted as guide, while fifty others were  to follow, to assist in the chase.  The pack-horses and all other  property were taken along, as they did not intend to return to the  kraal, although the chief earnestly requested them to remain and make  his village their home so long as they remained in the neighbourhood.    For more than a mile their way led through small plantations of maize,  owned by Macora's subjects, and cultivated by the women and younger  people of the tribe.    Our adventurers had seen many kraals of Bushmen, also of Bechuana and  Kaffir tribes, and were surprised to observe such evidences of  civilisation so far removed from the teachings and example of the Cape  Colonists.    On their way down the river, buffaloes were observed in small droves, as  also herds of koodoos and zebras.  They had reached a land that gave  good promise of the very adventures they were in search of.    About five miles from the village they came upon a small open space  thickly covered with grass.  Here Macora suggested that they should make  their hunting camp, as the thick growth of timber seen farther down the  river was the resort of every species of game to be found for many miles  around.    Macora's suggestion was adopted; and his followers soon constructed a  stockade enclosure or kraal, to protect the camp.  While this was being  done the young hunters were not idle.    On the open plain beyond some antelopes were seen grazing, and Hendrik  and Arend went after them for the purpose of providing Macora's people  with food.    Groot Willem, on the other hand, preferred going towards the timber,  where he had been told there was larger game; and, accompanied by Macora  and four attendants, he started off, leaving Hans with Swartboy and  Congo to take care of the pack-horses and other _impedimenta_, as also  to superintend the building of the kraal.    Not far from the river-bank, Macora, with Willem, entered a dense forest  standing in a tract of low marshy ground.  They had not gone far, before  coming within sight of some reet boks (reed bucks, _Antelope  eleotragus_, Schreber).  These were not more than three hundred yards  away; and, from the unconcerned manner in which they continued their  occupation, Groot Willem saw that they had never been hunted by men  carrying fire-arms, although so near to a village of the Makololo.  The  innocent creatures were unworthy of a shot from his roer, and he passed  on without molesting them.    He was soon upon a path that showed signs of being nightly trodden by  large animals, on their way to the water.  Amongst other spoor, he was  pleased to observe that of the hippopotamus.  Several of these animals  had evidently left the river only two or three hours before, and were  then probably grazing in the neighbourhood.  They had been so little  disturbed by man, that, contrary to their usual custom, they came out  upon the land to browse by day.    Willem was satisfied that they had reached a place where they would be  content to stop for a while; and, without proceeding any farther, he  resolved to commence business by bringing down one of two buffaloes he  saw lying at some distance off, under the shade of a clump of trees.    Leaving Macora and his men in care of his horse and three dogs which he  had brought with him, he passed to the leeward of the game, trying to  get between the buffaloes and the forest, to head them off in case of  their retreating to the cover.    Willem was too much of a sportsman to think of stalking upon the  buffaloes, and shooting at them while asleep; and after gaining the  desired station, he whistled for his dogs, for the purpose of giving the  buffaloes a bit of a chase, and trying a shot at them while on the run.  His signal was scarce given, when he heard loud yells from the natives  and the report of Macora's musket.    Something had gone wrong; for he saw that his own horse was loose and  galloping over the plain, while the natives were scampering in different  directions, evidently under the inspiration of fear.    The ox upon which Macora sat seemed trying its speed with his horse.  The three dogs had answered his call and were coming towards him.  They  were pursued by something,--by a creature that passed over the ground in  a succession of long low leaps, and yet so much time was lost in  gathering strength for each spring, that it did not much lessen the  distance between itself and the animals it was pursuing.    The buffaloes had started up and gone off at full canter towards the  timber,--passing within less than fifty paces of the spot where Willem  stood.  He allowed them to escape unmolested.  A creature more deserving  of his attention was rapidly approaching from the other side.        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    THE FAITHFUL \"SMOKE.\"    As yet, the dogs did not seem aware that an enemy was after them.  They  had heard their master's whistle, and having been released from the  leash, were only intent in obeying the command.    On rousing the buffaloes from their repose, they probably thought that  they had been called for the express purpose of pursuing and destroying  them; and, heedless of all else, they followed upon the heels of the  great quadrupeds, passing close to the hunter, who in vain endeavoured  to call them off.  He was soon otherwise occupied.    The creature in pursuit of the dogs, and which had caused the flight of  Macora and his attendants, was a large leopard.  It was a female, and  rapidly there passed through the hunter's mind a conjecture of the  circumstances under which the animal was acting.    It had left its young in its forest lair, and had been on a visit to the  river for water or food.  It had not pursued Macora or his attendants,  as its solicitude was for its young, and the dogs were now running in  the direction where these were concealed.    At sight of Groot Willem, the leopard desisted from its pursuit of the  dogs; and, crouching low upon the ground, crawled towards him,--not  slowly, but with a speed only checked by instinctive caution.  As it  advanced, its whole body was covered by the head, its eyes being the  highest part of it presented to the view of the hunter.    The _felidea_ was now within ten yards of him and rapidly drawing  nearer.  Something must be done.  The roer was raised to his shoulder,  and with a steady hand and eye,--nerved by the perilous position he was  in,--he drew a fine sight at the creature's snout and fired.    The shot took effect, for the leopard rolled over, rose up, turned  around two or three times, and for a while seemed to have lost all  consciousness of what had transpired.  Its young and its enemy were for  a time apparently forgotten in the agony it was suffering from a broken  jaw.  This, however, was but for a few seconds, for the sight of the  hunter soon after aroused it to a perfect realisation of all that had  taken place.    Willem, after firing, had run off to about fifty paces, and then stopped  to reload.  While so engaged he kept his eye fixed upon the leopard.  It  was again coming towards him, no longer with the caution it had before  exhibited, but in a manner that showed its whole animal nature was  absorbed by the spirit of revenge.    By the time he had placed the bullet in the barrel of his gun and driven  it home, the brute was close upon him.  There was not time for him to  withdraw the ramrod, much less to put on a cap.  Grasping his roer by  the barrel, he prepared to defend himself, intending to use the weapon  as a club.  The enraged creature was about to make a spring upon him,  when assistance came from a quarter altogether unexpected.    One of the dogs--a large bull-dog called \"Smoke\"--had not followed the  buffaloes to cover.  It had obeyed its master's command when called back  from the chase.  Just as the leopard was crouching upon the earth to  gather force for the final spring, Smoke seized it by one of the hind  legs.  Not a second of time was lost by Willem.  One more chance for  life had been thus given him, and he hastened to avail himself of it.    The hammer of the lock was thrown back and a cap placed on the nipple in  less time than nine out of ten well-drilled soldiers could have  performed the same feat; but by the time it was done, and the gun  brought to his shoulder, poor Smoke was lying in his death-struggle  along the grass.    The _felidea_ had turned to renew the attack on its human enemy.  One  second more, and its huge body would have been launched against him,--  its sharp claws buried in his flesh.    He pulled trigger and sprang backwards.  A cloud of smoke rolled before  his eyes, and, as this cleared away, he saw the leopard laid out along  the earth by the side of the wounded dog,--like the latter, kicking out  its legs in the last throes of death.    On looking for his companions, Willem saw that Macora and his men,  having stopped at a distance of about five hundred yards off, had  witnessed his victory.  The chief was now hastening towards him on foot,  and was soon by his side, when, pointing to the ox about half a mile  away, he tried to make Willem understand that that animal had carried  him unwillingly away from his friend.    Perceiving all danger was over, the others came up; when, by signs, the  big hunter gave them to understand that he wanted the hide taken off the  leopard.  The four attendants went to work with their short assagais, in  a manner that told him he would not have long to wait for a beautiful  leopard skin, as a trophy of his victory, as also a memento of the  danger through which he had passed.    He himself turned his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],[0,"Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#9)"],[1,"a man-o'-war dressed  out in all her bunting for some great gala occasion, but still showing  her grim, heavy outlines beneath her decorations. His broad mouth opened  clear back under his eyes, and was armed with rows of backward-pointing  teeth, so sharp and strong that when they once fastened themselves upon  a smaller fish they never let him go again. The only way out from  between those jaws was down his throat. His eyes were large and bright,  and were set well apart; and the bulge of his forehead between them  hinted at more brains than are allotted to some of the people of the  stream. Altogether, he was a most gallant and knightly little fish, and  it would certainly have been a pity if he hadn't found a mate.    [Illustration: _Nesting Grounds._]    And now he started the third time for the gravelly shallow, and  travelled as he had never travelled before in all his life. Streams are  made to swim against--every brook trout knows that--and the faster they  run, the greater is the joy of breasting them. The higher the  water-fall, the prouder do you feel when you find you can leap it. And  our friend was in a mood for swimming, and for swimming with all his  might. Never had he felt so strong and vigorous and so full of life and  energy, and he made his fins and his tail go like the oars of a  racing-shell. Now he was working up the swift current of a long rapid  like a bird in the teeth of the wind. Now he was gathering all his  strength for the great leap to the top of the water-fall. And now,  perhaps, he rested for a little while in a quiet pool, and presently  went hurrying on again, diving under logs and fallen trees, swinging  round the curves, darting up the still places where the water lay  a-dreaming, and wriggling over shallow bars where it was not half deep  enough to cover him; until at last he reached the old familiar place  where so many generations of brook trout had first seen the light of day  and felt the cold touch of the snow-water.    As before, he and the other males arrived at the nesting grounds some  days in advance of their mates, and spent the intervening time in  scooping hollows in the gravel and quarrelling among themselves. Two or  three times he was driven from a choice location by someone who was  bigger than he, but he always managed in some way to regain it, or else  stole another from a smaller fish; and when the ladies finally appeared  he had a fine large nest in a pleasant situation a little apart from  those of his rivals. But for some reason the first candidates who came  to look at it declined to stay. Perhaps they were not quite ready to  settle down, or perhaps they were merely disposed to insist on the  feminine privilege of changing their minds. But finally there came one  who seemed to be quite satisfied, and with whom the Trout himself had  every reason to be pleased.    She was not a native of the stream, but of one of the hatcheries of the  Michigan Fish Commission; and while he was lying in the gravel she was  one of a vast company inhabiting a number of black wooden troughs that  stood in a large, pleasant room filled with the sound of running water.  Here there were no yearlings nor musk-rats nor saw-bill ducks looking  for fresh eggs, nor any dragons nor star-gazers lying in wait for the  young fry. Instead there were nice, kind men, who kept the hatching  troughs clean and the water at the right temperature, and who gently  stirred up the troutlets with a long goose-feather whenever too many of  them crowded together in one corner, trying to get away from the hateful  light. Under this sort of treatment most of the thirty million babies in  the hatchery lived and thrived. Only a few thousands of them were brook  trout, but among those thousands one of the smartest and most precocious  was the one in whom we are just now most interested. She was always  first into the dark corners, as long as dark corners seemed desirable;  and later, when they began to come up into the light and partake of the  pulverized beef-liver which their attendants offered them, there was no  better swimmer or more voracious feeder than she. All this was  especially fortunate because there was a very hard and trying experience  before her--one in which she would have need of all her strength and  vitality, and in which her chances of life would be very small, indeed.  It came with planting time, when she and a host of her companions were  whisked through a rubber tube and deposited in a big can made of  galvanized iron, in which they were borne away to the trout stream. The  journey was a long one, they were pretty badly cramped for room, and  before they reached their destination the supply of oxygen in the water  became exhausted. The baby trout began to think they had blown out the  gas, and they all crowded to the surface, where, if anywhere, the minute  bubbles that keep one alive are to be found. They gulped down great  mouthfuls of water and forced it out through their gills as fast as ever  they could, but, somehow, all the life seemed to be gone out of it, and  it did them no good whatever. Pretty soon a few turned over on their  backs and died, and every last one of them would have suffocated if the  man who had charge of the party hadn't noticed what was going on and  come to the rescue. Picking up a dipperful of water and troutlets, and  holding it high in the air, he poured it back into the can with much  dashing and splashing. Hundreds and hundreds of tiny bubbles were caught  in the rush and carried down to the bottom, and so the oxygen came back  again to the tired gills, and the danger was over.    The emigrants reached the trout stream at last, and one would have  supposed that their troubles were ended. In reality the chapter of  trials and tribulations had only just begun, for the same fishes and  frogs and lizards that had so persecuted our friend and his brothers and  sisters were on hand to welcome the new arrivals, and very few escaped.  And so, in spite of its quiet beginnings in the peaceful surroundings  of the hatchery, this young lady trout's life proved quite as exciting  and adventurous as our friend's, and it is possible that the good care  which she received during her early infancy really served to make things  all the harder for her when she came to be thrown entirely on her own  resources. The mere change in the temperature of the water when she was  turned out of the can was quite a shock to her nervous system; and,  whereas most trout are somewhat acquainted with the dangers and  hardships of the stream, almost from the time they rip their shells  open, she did not even know that there was such a place until she was  set down in it and told to shift for herself.    However, by dint of strength, speed, agility, and good judgment in  selecting hiding-places--and also, in all probability, by a run of  remarkably good luck--she made her way unharmed through all the perils  of babyhood and early youth, and now she was one of the most beautiful  little three-year-old pirates that ever swooped down upon a helpless  victim.    As she and our friend swam side by side, her nose and the end of her  tail were exactly even with his. Her colors were the same that he had  worn before he put on his wedding garments, and if you had seen them  together in the early summer I don't believe you could ever have told  them apart. They were a well-matched pair, more evenly mated, probably,  than is usual in fish marriages.    But they were not to be allowed to set up housekeeping together without  fighting for the privilege. Hardly had she finished inspecting the nest,  and made up her mind that it would answer, and that he was, on the  whole, quite eligible as a husband, when a third trout appeared and  attempted to do as the big bully had done the year before. This time,  however, our young friend's blood was up, and, though the enemy was  considerably larger than he, he was ready to strike for his altars and  his fires. He made a quick rush, like a torpedo-boat attacking a  man-of-war, and hit the intruder amidships, ramming him with all his  might. Then the enemy made as sudden a turn, and gave our Trout a poke  in the ribs, and for a few minutes they dodged back and forth, and round  and round, and over and under each other, each getting in a punch  whenever he had a chance. So far it seemed only a trial of strength and  speed and dexterity, and if our Trout was not quite as large and  powerful as the other, yet he proved himself the quicker and the more  agile and lively. But before it was over he did more than that, for,  suddenly ranging up on the enemy's starboard quarter, he opened his  mouth, and the sharp teeth of his lower jaw tore a row of bright scales  from his adversary's side, and left a long, deep gash behind. That  settled it. The big fellow lit out as fast as he could go, and our Trout  was left in undisputed possession.    The nesting season cannot last forever, and by and by, when the days  were very short and the nights were very long, when the stars were  bright, and when each sunrise found the hoar-frost lying thick and heavy  on the dead and fallen leaves, the last trout went in search of better  feeding grounds, and again the gravelly shallow seemed deserted. But it  was only seeming. There were no eggs in sight--the frogs, the rats, the  ducks, and the yearlings had taken care of that, and I am very much  afraid that our friend may have eaten a few himself, on the sly, when  his wife wasn't looking--but hidden away among the pebbles there were  thousands, and the old, old miracle was being re-enacted, and multitudes  of little live creatures were getting ready for the time when something  should tell them to tear their shells open and come out into the world.    One of the Trout's most remarkable adventures, and the one which  probably taught him more than any other, came during the hot weather of  the following summer. The"]]]
