The world applauds the lucky hit,  When it beholds the biter bit.    A treach'rous fox invited down  A cock, who on a tree had flown.  \"Do you not know, my friend,\" says he,  \"Bird, beast, fish, reptile, man agree,  To live henceforth in amity?  Come down and celebrate the day.\"  \"Troth,\" quoth the cock, \"you truly say;  For hounds I see come o'er the dell,  With open mouths, the news to tell.\"  \"Adieu,\" says Ren. \"'Tis best to go;  Those dogs the treaty may not know.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE BLIND MAN AND THE LAME.      Who kind assistance give and take,  Life's arduous journey best will make.    Two men, one blind, the other lame,  To pass a ford together came.  The stream was rapid, and the way  Obliquely thwart the current lay;  To his companion says the blind,  \"Yon winding road I ne'er shall find.\"  \"Nor my poor limbs,\" the lame replied,  \"The current's rapid force abide.\"  \"Come,\" says the blind, \"my loins are strong,  I'll bear you on my back along,  While you to guide me give the word;\"  And thus they safely cross'd the ford.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE MAN AND THE SERPENT.      There's in the world a cursed race,  Of nature so perverse and base,  If from the gallows you should save,  A dangerous enemy you have.    A countryman a serpent found,  Stiffen'd with frost upon the ground,  And took her home; but when the fire  Began new vigor to inspire,  Swelling her neck with angry eyes,  She fills the cot with hissing cries.  The rustic then his axe did take,  \"Is this then the return you make?  Is this your gratitude?\" he said,  And knock'd the reptile on the head.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE TWO STREAMS.      Those who display much dash and din,  Have seldom any thing within.    A weary traveller, one day,  Cross'd o'er a river in his way;  Alarm'd to see the foaming tide  Dashing o'er rocks from side to side,  Nevertheless, his course to keep,  He ventur'd in with trembling step;  And found the water neither deep,  Nor footing bad; and got well o'er.  When he had travell'd some leagues more,  He to another river came,  That smoothly flowed, a silent stream:  This he thought easily to pass;  But ere he in the middle was,  He plunged into a gulf profound,  And for his feet no bottom found;  But, forced to swim with all his might,  Got to the shore in piteous plight.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE SOT AND HIS WIFE.      Inveterate sin is seldom cur'd.    A wife had long a sot endur'd,  Who all his time in taverns spent,  While his affairs in ruin went.  Once as insensible he lay,  She dress'd him in a corpse's array,  And with the undertaker's aid,  Into a burying vault convey'd.  The fumes dispersed, the man awakes;  All for reality he takes.  When by the glimmering of a lamp  He saw his mansion drear and damp,  Reflecting how his life had pass'd,  A forced repentance came at last.  The wife, with suited voice and dress,  Presented an infernal mess:  \"Good Trap, pray take away your meat;  I have no appetite to eat,\"  He cried, \"but faith I'm devilish dry:  Can't you a bowl of wine supply?\"  The woman, seeing all was vain,  Restor'd him to his casks again:  Consol'd with certainty, that he  Ere long a real corpse must be.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE FARMER AND HIS QUARRELSOME  SONS.      Three sons an honest farmer had;  And it so happen'd, ne'er a lad  Could with the other two agree;  All quarrelling perpetually.  Their time in idle contest spent,  Garden and farm to ruin went;  And the good farmer and his wife  Led but a miserable life.  One day as this unhappy sire  Sat musing by his evening fire,  He saw some twigs in bundles stand,  Tied for the basket-maker's hand.  Taking up one: \"My boys,\" says he,  \"Which is the strongest, let me see;  He who this bundle breaks in twain,  The preference, and this prize shall gain,\"  (Showing a pair of Sunday shoes.)  The rivals every effort use  In vain. Their utmost force when tried,  The father took the twigs untied,  And giving to them one by one,  The work immediately was done.  \"Yon twigs,\" he says, \"that broken lie,  This useful lesson may supply:  That those in amity who live,  And succor to each other give,  Double their forces to resist  Oppression, and their work assist.\"          [Illustration]    THE FIG TREE AND THE FLOWERING  SHRUB.      Flowers which many leaves display,  In fruitless beauty fade away.    Cries one of these, with saucy sneer,  To a plain fig-tree growing near,  \"How comes it, honest friend, that thou  Dost in the spring no blossoms show?\"  Says he, \"I keep them out of view,  For fear I should resemble you,  And in the autumn nought produce  Of permanence and solid use.\"    Who soon and much essay to shine,  May dread a premature decline.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE FARMER AND THE LANDLORD.      A farmer of an honest fame,  One morning to his landlord came:  \"Alas, my lord,\" he weeping said,  \"Gored by my bull, your ox is dead.  What must be done?\" \"The case is plain,\"  Replies the lord; \"the creature slain,  The owner of the bull must pay;  Let it be done without delay.\"  \"Heav'n give your worship long to live!  I hope you will a good one give,  For mine was good!\" \"How! your's, my friend?  Let me your story comprehend:  Your bull, you say, my ox has gored?\"  \"Forgive me the mistake, my lord,  In my confusion I have made;  Mine was the ox that must be paid;  But 'tis all one--what's just for me  The same must for your worship be:  I'll tell the steward what you say.\"  \"Not yet--we'll think of it to-day.  Further inquiry must be had;  Perhaps your fences were but bad;  Perhaps--but come again to-morrow.\"  The honest laborer saw with sorrow,  That justice wears a different face,  When for themselves men put the case.          [Illustration]    THE SCHOOL-BOY AND THE  MONITOR.      At play on Thames's verdant side  A school boy fell into the tide,  Where providentially there stood  A willow, bending o'er the flood.  Buoy'd on its branch, he floating lay,  The monitor pass'd by that way.  The lad entreats his life to save:  The Don replies with aspect grave,  \"Sirrah, what business had you there?  How vain is all our watchful care!  You never heed a word we say;  Your disobedience you shall pay!\"  \"First,\" says the boy, \"pray stretch your hand:  I'll hear you when I come to land.\"    This is for those, with vain parade  Who give advice, instead of aid.          [Illustration]    THE MILLER AND HIS ASS.      A rustic bringing to the fair  An ass, that he might show him there,  Sleek and well looking let him trot;  He followed with his son on foot.  The first they met upon the road,  At our pedestrians laugh'd loud,  \"Look at those two legged asses,\" cried,  \"Who trudge on foot when they might ride!\"  The father with the hint complies:  Makes the boy mount. Now other cries  Assail their ears; by graybeards blam'd;  \"Sirrah, you ought to be asham'd  To ride and let your father walk!\"  Again he listened to their talk.  The sire got up, the youth got down;  When passing through a country town,  At every door the mothers said,  \"A murrain light on thy old head!  Hast thou no bowels for thy kind?  At least take up the lad behind.\"  This done they next were thus address'd:  \"Two lubbers on a little beast?  They fitter are to carry him!\"  Complying with this senseless whim,  Upon a pole his feet in air,  The ass they on their shoulders bear.  Now laughing shouts spread far and wide.  The ass's ligatures untied,  \"Proceed, my son,\" then said the man:  \"To please the world, do all we can,  Since 'tis impossible, you see,  To please ourselves content we'll be.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE DREAMER AND HIS SON.      Mortals bring down upon their head  The very miseries most they dread.    The only son of a rich knight  In hunting daily took delight.  The father living in alarm,  Lest he should come to any harm,  Dream'd that he saw him on the ground,  Rent with the lion's fatal wound.  The youth, allow'd to hunt no more,  Impatiently confinement bore.  Remarking, one unlucky day,  In the fine chamber where he lay,  A lion painted on the wall,  \"Thou art,\" he cried, \"the cause of all.\"  With idle rage the wall he struck,  And in his hand an iron stuck,  Which piercing bones and sinews through,  Fester'd and then a gangrene grew.  And thus the father's ill-tim'd care  Deprived him of his son and heir.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE OLD MAN AND DEATH.      Though life be welcome to the wise,  Death cannot take him by surprise;  Aware that every day and hour  He holds but at the tyrant's power,  That beauty, talents, worth, are vain.  A moment's respite to obtain.  Nothing more known, and yet how rare  It is with courage to prepare  For this inevitable day!  All hope a little more delay.    One who had suffer'd many a year,  And to a century drew near,  At last complain'd, that unawares  Death came, unsettled his affairs:  \"My will is not completely made;  A little time,\" he trembling said,  \"A little longer let me live;  Some warning 'tis but fair to give!  My grandson is expected home;  At least pray, let the doctor come.\"  \"Poor helpless driveller!\" Death replied,  \"Ten years ago thou should'st have died!  Thy friends, thy foes, thyself outliv'd:  Almost an age thou hast surviv'd:  Some who their day had scarce begun.  Others beneath their noon-tide sun--  Time's deepest lines engrave thy brow,  And dost thou hesitate to go?  Idiot, what warning would'st thou have?  One foot already in the grave:  Sight, hearing, feeling, day by day,  Sunk gradual in a long decay.  I blame myself for my neglect;  Thou'st not a moment to expect!\"    When failing nature warns, the sage  Sees death a refuge from old age;  And rising from life's lengthened feast,  Willing retires, a sated guest.

He lent money, but  expected to be repaid even by his brother-in-law. And this prudence  helped to retain the confidence, while his sympathetic temperament  secured the liking, of most. Again, he had the valuable knack of  constantly replenishing the number of his friends among men junior to  himself. His character attracted the liking of Sulla, who was  twenty-seven years his senior, and he remained the close friend of his  contemporaries Hortensius and Cicero (the former five years his senior,  the latter three years his junior) till the day of their death. But we  also find him on intimate terms with Brutus, twenty-four, and Octavian,  forty-six years junior to himself. Lastly, he was not too much at Rome.  More than twenty years of his earlier manhood (B.C. 87-65) were spent in  Greece, principally at Athens, partly in study and partly in business.  And Athens at this time, long deprived of political importance, had  still the charm not only of its illustrious past, but also of its  surviving character as the home of culture and refinement. When he at  length returned to Rome in B.C. 65, he had already purchased a property  in Epirus, near Buthrotum (see p. 3), where he built a villa, in which  he continued to spend a considerable part of his remaining years. This  was sufficiently remote, not only from Rome, but from the summer  residences of the Roman nobles, to secure his isolation from the  intrigues and enmities of Roman society. He did not indeed--as who  does?--always escape giving offence. At the very beginning of the  correspondence we hear of his vain attempts to mollify the anger of L.  Lucceius--how incurred we do not know; and Quintus Cicero, of whose  sharp temper we hear so much, was on more than one occasion on the point  of a rupture with him. But his family life was generally as pleasing as  his connexion with his friends. With his mother, who lived to a great  age, he boasted that he had never been reconciled, because he had never  quarrelled. He was the only one who could get on with the crusty uncle  Caecilius. In the delicate matter of his sister Pomponia's differences  with her husband Quintus Cicero, he seems to have acted with kindness as  well as prudence; and though he married late in life (B.C. 56, when he  was in his fifty-third year), he appears to have made an excellent  husband to Pilia and a very affectionate father to his daughter. His  unwearied sympathy with the varied moods of Cicero--whether of  exultation, irritation, or despair--and the entire confidence which  Cicero feels that he will have that sympathy in every case, are  creditable to both. It is only between sincere souls that one can speak  to the other as to a second self, as Cicero often alleges that he does  to Atticus.    [Sidenote: Quintus Tullius Cicero.]    Of QUINTUS CICERO, the next most important correspondent in this volume,  we get a fairly clear picture. Four years younger than his famous  brother (b. B.C. 102), he followed him at the due distance up the ladder  of official promotion to the praetorship, to which he was elected in the  year of his elder's consulship. There, however, Quintus stopped. He  never seems to have stood for the consulship. He had no oratorical  genius to give him reputation in the forum, nor were his literary  productions of any value, either for style or originality. His abilities  for administration, as shewn in his three years' government of Asia,  appear to have been respectable, but were marred by faults of temper,  which too often betrayed him into extreme violence of language. In  military command he shewed courage and energy in defending his camp in  the rising of the Gauls in the winter of B.C. 54-53; but he spoilt the  reputation thus gained by the mistake committed in the autumn of B.C.  53, which cost the loss of a considerable number of troops, and all but  allowed the roving Germans to storm his camp. He remained another year  in Gaul, but did nothing to retrieve this mistake. In military affairs  fortune rarely forgives. In politics he seems to have contented himself  generally with saying ditto to his brother. And this continued to be the  case up to Pharsalia. After that, finding himself on the losing side, he  turned somewhat fiercely upon the brother, whom he regarded as having  misled him; and for a time there was a miserable breach between them,  which, however, did not last very long. When the end came it found the  brothers united in heart as in misfortune. His private happiness was  marred by an uncongenial marriage. Pomponia--sister of Atticus--seems to  have been as high-tempered as her husband, and less placable. The  constant quarrels between them exercised the patience both of Cicero and  Atticus, and crops up all through the correspondence. One effect of them  was the loss of all control over their son, who, being called upon to  smooth over the differences between father and mother, naturally took up  at an early age a line of his own, and shewed a disposition to act  independently of his elders.    [Sidenote: Terentia.]    The letters to TERENTIA do not fill much space in the correspondence,  and are rarely interesting. Married about B.C. 80, Cicero seems to have  lived in harmony with her at least till the time of his return from  exile, during which unhappy period he acknowledges the activity of her  exertions in support of his recall, and the drain which his ruin was  making upon her resources. Terentia had a large private fortune, and  apparently used it liberally in his service. Nevertheless, immediately  on his return from exile, there seems to have been some cause of  coldness between the husband and wife. He darkly alludes to certain  domestic troubles in the first letter to Atticus written from Rome (vol  i., p. 189), and repeats the hint in the next (p. 193). When he landed  at Brundisium it was Tullia, not Terentia, who came to meet him (p.  187), and for some time after she appears to be presiding in his house  rather than Terentia (see pp. 224, 257). Whatever the cause of this  coldness was, however, it appears to have been removed for a time. He  kept up a correspondence with her while he was in Cilicia (B.C. 51-50),  and though he does not seem pleased at her having arranged the marriage  of Tullia with Dolabella, he addresses her warmly when about to return,  and was met by her on landing. During the five or six months that  followed, before Cicero left Italy to join Pompey, there is no  indication of any alienation: but the short notes from Pompey's camp,  and in the first half of B.C. 47, are cold and conventional, and on his  return to Brundisium after Pharsalia, and during his lengthened stay  there, he appears to have declined to allow her to come and see him.  Soon after his return to Rome, in September, B.C. 47, matters came to a  climax. Perhaps some of the mischief was caused by the mismanagement or  dishonesty of Terentia's steward, Philotimus, of whom we hear a good  deal in the letters from Cilicia: but whatever was the origin of the  quarrel, Cicero asserts that on his return he found his affairs in a  state of utter disorder. It may well have been that, like other  adherents to the losing cause, he had to suffer from loss of any  property that could be easily laid hands on in Rome, and that Terentia  had had no power to save it. But Cicero, rightly or wrongly, attributed  the embarrassment which he found awaiting him to his wife. He says in a  letter to Gnaeus Plancius:[21] \"I should not have taken any new step at a  time of such general disaster had I not on my return found my private  affairs in as sorry a position as the public. The fact is, that when I  saw that, owing to the criminal conduct of those to whom my life and  fortunes ought, in return for my never-to-be-forgotten services, to have  been their dearest object, there was nothing safe within the walls of my  house, nothing that was not the subject of some intrigue, I made up my  mind that I must arm myself by the faithful support of new marriage  connexions against the perfidy of the old.\" This is a lame excuse for a  man of sixty separating from the companion of his whole manhood, and in  the eyes of Roman Society it was rendered still more questionable by a  prompt marriage with a young girl, rich, and his own ward: from whom,  however, he soon again divorced himself, angered, it is said, by her  want of feeling at the death of Tullia. Terentia long survived her  husband, living, we are told, to be over a hundred years old. Divorce  was, of course, not regarded in these days of the Republic as it had  once been, or as it is now among ourselves; still we should have been  glad, both for his fame and his happiness, if the few years remaining to  him had not had this additional cloud. A man of sixty embarking on such  matrimonial enterprise is not a dignified spectacle, or one pleasing to  gods and men.    The other correspondents may be dismissed in few words.    [Sidenote: P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther.]    P. CORNELIUS LENTULUS SPINTHER, to whom some of the longest letters are  addressed, represents the high aristocracy, to which Cicero wished to  commend himself, though seeing keenly the weakness which underlay their  magnificence. The part played by Lentulus in politics had been showy,  but never founded on steadfast principle. He owed his earlier promotions  to Caesar's influence, but in his consulship of B.C. 57 had taken the  side of the aristocracy in promoting the recall of Cicero, though he had  gone against their sentiment by supporting Pompey's appointment to the  _cura annonae_. But as he was going to Cilicia in B.C. 56, Lentulus  wished to have the lucrative task of restoring Ptolemy Auletes to the  throne of Egypt, from which he had been righteously driven by his  subjects. Therefore it was all to the good that Pompey should have  business at home preventing him from taking this in hand. How Lentulus "]]]
