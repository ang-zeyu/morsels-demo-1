There was a sort of sulky  defiance in her eyes, which only goes with guilty knowledge. However,  there's no good talking any more about it, Watson; but unless some lucky  chance comes our way I fear that the Norwood Disappearance Case will not  figure in that chronicle of our successes which I foresee that a patient  public will sooner or later have to endure.\"    \"Surely,\" said I, \"the man's appearance would go far with any jury?\"    \"That is a dangerous argument, my dear Watson. You remember that  terrible murderer, Bert Stevens, who wanted us to get him off in '87?  Was there ever a more mild-mannered, Sunday-school young man?\"    \"It is true.\"    \"Unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory this man is  lost. You can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now be presented  against him, and all further investigation has served to strengthen it.  By the way, there is one curious little point about those papers which  may serve us as the starting-point for an inquiry. On looking over the  bank-book I found that the low state of the balance was principally due  to large cheques which have been made out during the last year to Mr.  Cornelius. I confess that I should be interested to know who this  Mr. Cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large  transactions. Is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair?  Cornelius might be a broker, but we have found no scrip to correspond  with these large payments. Failing any other indication my researches  must now take the direction of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman  who has cashed these cheques. But I fear, my dear fellow, that our  case will end ingloriously by Lestrade hanging our client, which will  certainly be a triumph for Scotland Yard.\"    I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night, but  when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his bright  eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. The carpet round his  chair was littered with cigarette-ends and with the early editions of  the morning papers. An open telegram lay upon the table.    \"What do you think of this, Watson?\" he asked, tossing it across.    It was from Norwood, and ran as follows:--         \"IMPORTANT FRESH EVIDENCE TO HAND.  MCFARLANE'S GUILT       DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED.  ADVISE YOU TO ABANDON CASE.       --LESTRADE.\"    \"This sounds serious,\" said I.    \"It is Lestrade's little cock-a-doodle of victory,\" Holmes answered,  with a bitter smile. \"And yet it may be premature to abandon the case.  After all, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing, and may  possibly cut in a very different direction to that which Lestrade  imagines. Take your breakfast, Watson, and we will go out together and  see what we can do. I feel as if I shall need your company and your  moral support to-day.\"    My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his peculiarities  that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and I  have known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from  pure inanition. \"At present I cannot spare energy and nerve force for  digestion,\" he would say in answer to my medical remonstrances. I was  not surprised, therefore, when this morning he left his untouched meal  behind him and started with me for Norwood. A crowd of morbid sightseers  were still gathered round Deep Dene House, which was just such a  suburban villa as I had pictured. Within the gates Lestrade met us, his  face flushed with victory, his manner grossly triumphant.    \"Well, Mr. Holmes, have you proved us to be wrong yet? Have you found  your tramp?\" he cried.    \"I have formed no conclusion whatever,\" my companion answered.    \"But we formed ours yesterday, and now it proves to be correct; so you  must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this time,  Mr. Holmes.\"    \"You certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred,\" said  Holmes.    Lestrade laughed loudly.    \"You don't like being beaten any more than the rest of us do,\" said he.  \"A man can't expect always to have it his own way, can he, Dr. Watson?  Step this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I think I can convince you  once for all that it was John McFarlane who did this crime.\"    He led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond.    \"This is where young McFarlane must have come out to get his hat  after the crime was done,\" said he. \"Now, look at this.\" With dramatic  suddenness he struck a match and by its light exposed a stain of blood  upon the whitewashed wall. As he held the match nearer I saw that it was  more than a stain. It was the well-marked print of a thumb.    \"Look at that with your magnifying glass, Mr. Holmes.\"    \"Yes, I am doing so.\"    \"You are aware that no two thumb marks are alike?\"    \"I have heard something of the kind.\"    \"Well, then, will you please compare that print with this wax impression  of young McFarlane's right thumb, taken by my orders this morning?\"    As he held the waxen print close to the blood-stain it did not take  a magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from the same  thumb. It was evident to me that our unfortunate client was lost.    \"That is final,\" said Lestrade.    \"Yes, that is final,\" I involuntarily echoed.    \"It is final,\" said Holmes.    Something in his tone caught my ear, and I turned to look at him. An  extraordinary change had come over his face. It was writhing with inward  merriment. His two eyes were shining like stars. It seemed to me that  he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of  laughter.    \"Dear me! Dear me!\" he said at last. \"Well, now, who would have thought  it? And how deceptive appearances may be, to be sure! Such a nice young  man to look at! It is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgment, is  it not, Lestrade?\"    \"Yes, some of us are a little too much inclined to be cocksure, Mr.  Holmes,\" said Lestrade. The man's insolence was maddening, but we could  not resent it.    \"What a providential thing that this young man should press his right  thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg! Such a very  natural action, too, if you come to think of it.\" Holmes was outwardly  calm, but his whole body gave a wriggle of suppressed excitement as he  spoke. \"By the way, Lestrade, who made this remarkable discovery?\"    \"It was the housekeeper, Mrs. Lexington, who drew the night constable's  attention to it.\"    \"Where was the night constable?\"    \"He remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was committed, so  as to see that nothing was touched.\"    \"But why didn't the police see this mark yesterday?\"    \"Well, we had no particular reason to make a careful examination of the  hall. Besides, it's not in a very prominent place, as you see.\"    \"No, no, of course not. I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was  there yesterday?\"    Lestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he was going out of his mind.  I confess that I was myself surprised both at his hilarious manner and  at his rather wild observation.    \"I don't know whether you think that McFarlane came out of gaol in the  dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself,\"  said Lestrade. \"I leave it to any expert in the world whether that is  not the mark of his thumb.\"    \"It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb.\"    \"There, that's enough,\" said Lestrade. \"I am a practical man, Mr.  Holmes, and when I have got my evidence I come to my conclusions. If  you have anything to say you will find me writing my report in the  sitting-room.\"    Holmes had recovered his equanimity, though I still seemed to detect  gleams of amusement in his expression.    \"Dear me, this is a very sad development, Watson, is it not?\" said he.  \"And yet there are singular points about it which hold out some hopes  for our client.\"    \"I am delighted to hear it,\" said I, heartily. \"I was afraid it was all  up with him.\"    \"I would hardly go so far as to say that, my dear Watson. The fact is  that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our  friend attaches so much importance.\"    \"Indeed, Holmes! What is it?\"    \"Only this: that I KNOW that that mark was not there when I examined the  hall yesterday. And now, Watson, let us have a little stroll round in  the sunshine.\"    With a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of hope  was returning, I accompanied my friend in a walk round the garden.  Holmes took each face of the house in turn and examined it with great  interest. He then led the way inside and went over the whole building  from basement to attics. Most of the rooms were unfurnished, but  none the less Holmes inspected them all minutely. Finally, on the top  corridor, which ran outside three untenanted bedrooms, he again was  seized with a spasm of merriment.    \"There are really some very unique features about this case, Watson,\"  said he. \"I think it is time now that we took our friend Lestrade into  our confidence. He has had his little smile at our expense, and perhaps  we may do as much by him if my reading of this problem proves to be  correct. Yes, yes; I think I see how we should approach it.\"    The Scotland Yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when Holmes  interrupted him.    \"I understood that you were writing a report of this case,\" said he.    \"So I am.\"    \"Don't you think it may be a little premature? I can't help thinking  that your evidence is not complete.\"    Lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words. He laid down  his pen and looked curiously at him.    \"What do you mean, Mr. Holmes?\"    \"Only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen.\"    \"Can you produce him?\"    \"I think I can.\"    \"Then do so.\"    \"I will do my best. How many constables have you?\"    \"There are three within call.\"    \"Excellent!\" said Holmes. \"May I ask if they are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22101"],[0,"Wood Folk at School (#9)"],[1,"another bit  of the poetic justice which you stumble upon everywhere in the big  woods.    It is more and more evident, I think, that Nature adapts her gifts, not  simply to the necessities, but more largely to the desires, of her  creatures. The force and influence of that intense desire--more intense  because usually each animal has but one--we have not yet learned to  measure. The owl has a silent wing, not simply because he needs it--for  his need is no greater than that of the hawk, who has no silent  wing--but, more probably, because of his whole-hearted desire for  silence as he glides through the silent twilight. And so with the  panther's foot; and so with the deer's eye, and the wolf's nose, whose  one idea of bliss is a good smell; and so with every other strongly  marked gift which the wild things have won from nature, chiefly by  desiring it, in the long years of their development.    This theory may possibly account for some of Mooween's peculiarities.  Nature, who measures her gifts according to the desires of her  creatures, remembers his love of peace and solitude, and endows him  accordingly. He cares little to see you or anybody else; therefore his  eyes are weak--his weakest point, in fact. He desires ardently to avoid  your society and all society but his own; therefore his nose and ears  are marvelously alert to discover your coming. Often, when you think  yourself quite alone in the woods, Mooween is there. The wind has told  your story to his nose; the clatter of your heedless feet long ago  reached his keen ears, and he vanishes at your approach, leaving you to  your noise and inquisitiveness and the other things you like. His gifts  of concealment are so much greater than your powers of detection that he  has absolutely no thought of ever seeing you. His surprise, therefore,  when you do meet unexpectedly is correspondingly greater than yours.    What he will do under the unusual circumstances depends largely, not  upon himself, but upon you. With one exception, his feelings are  probably the reverse of your own. If you are bold, he is timid as a  rabbit; if you are panic-stricken, he knows exactly what to do; if you  are fearful, he has no fear; if you are inquisitive, he is instantly  shy; and, like all other wild creatures, he has an almost uncanny way of  understanding your thought. It is as if, in that intent, penetrating  gaze of his, he saw your soul turned inside out for his inspection. The  only exception is when you meet him without fear or curiosity, with the  desire simply to attend to your own affairs, as if he were a stranger  and an equal. That rare mental attitude he understands perfectly--for is  it not his own?--and he goes his way quietly, as if he had not seen you.    For every chance meeting Mooween seems to have a plan of action ready,  which he applies without a question or an instant's hesitation. Make an  unknown sound behind him as he plods along the shore, and he hurls  himself headlong into the cover of the bushes, as if your voice had  touched a button that released a coiled spring beneath him. Afterwards  he may come back to find out what frightened him. Sit perfectly still,  and he rises on his hind legs for a look and a long sniff to find out  who you are. Jump at him with a yell and a flourish the instant he  appears, and he will hurl chips and dirt back at you as he digs his  toes into the hillside for a better grip and scrambles away whimpering  like a scared puppy.    Once in a way, as you steal through the autumn woods or hurry over the  trail, you will hear sudden loud rustlings and shakings on the hardwood  ridge above you, as if a small cyclone were perched there for a while,  amusing itself among the leaves before blowing on. Then, if you steal up  toward the sound, you will find Mooween standing on a big limb of a  beech tree, grasping the narrowing trunk with his powerful forearms,  tugging and pushing mightily to shake down the ripe beechnuts. The  rattle and dash of the falling fruit are such music to Mooween's ears  that he will not hear the rustle of your approach, nor the twig that  snaps under your careless foot.    If you cry aloud now to your friends, under the hilarious impression  that you have Mooween sure at last, there is another surprise awaiting  you. And that suggests a bit of advice, which is most pertinent: don't  stand under the bear when you cry out. If he is a little fellow, he will  shoot up the tree, faster than ever a jumping jack went up his stick,  and hide in a cluster of leaves, as near the top as he can get. But if  he is a big bear, he will tumble down on you before you know what has  happened. No slow climbing for him; he just lets go and comes down by  gravitation. As Uncle Remus says--who has some keen knowledge of animal  ways under his story-telling humor--\"Brer B'ar, he scramble 'bout  half-way down de bee tree, en den he turn eve'ything loose en hit de  groun' _kerbiff_! Look like 't wuz nuff ter jolt de life out'n 'im.\"    Somehow it never does jolt the life out of him, notwithstanding his  great weight; nor does it interfere in any way with his speed of action,  which is like lightning, the instant he touches the ground. Like the  coon, who can fall from an incredible distance without hurting himself,  Mooween comes down perfectly limp, falling on himself like a great  cushion; but the moment he strikes, all his muscles seem to contract at  once, and he bounds off like a rubber ball into the densest bit of cover  at hand.    Twice have I seen him come down in this way. The first time there were  two cubs, nearly full-grown, in a tree. One went up at our shout; the  other came down with such startling suddenness that the man who stood  ready with his rifle, to shoot the bear, jumped for his life to get out  of the way; and before he had blinked the astonishment out of his eyes  Mooween was gone, leaving only a violent nodding of the ground spruces  to tell what had become of him.    All these plans of ready action in Mooween's head, for the rare  occasions when he meets you unexpectedly, are the result of careful  training by his mother. If you should ever have the good fortune to  watch a mother bear and her cubs when they have no idea that you are  near them, you will note two characteristic things. First, when they are  traveling--and Mooween is the most restless tramp in all the woods--you  will see that the cubs follow the mother closely and imitate her every  action with ludicrous exactness, sniffing where she sniffs, jumping  where she jumps, rising on their hind legs, with forearms hanging  loosely and pointed noses thrust sharp up into the wind, on the instant  that she rises, and then drawing silently away from the shore into the  shelter of the friendly alders when some subtle warning tells the  mother's nose that the coast ahead is not perfectly clear. So they learn  to sift the sounds and smells of the wilderness, and to govern their  actions accordingly. And second, when they are playing you will see that  the mother watches the cubs' every action as keenly as they watched hers  an hour ago. She will sit flat on her haunches, her fore paws planted  between her outstretched hind legs, her great head on one side, noting  every detail of their boxing and wrestling and climbing, as if she had  showed them once how it ought to be done and were watching now to see  how well they remembered their lessons. And now and then one or the  other of the cubs receives a sound cuffing; for which I am unable to  account, except on the theory that he was doing something contrary to  his plain instructions.    It is only when Mooween meets some new object, or some circumstance  entirely outside of his training, that instinct and native wit are set  to work; and then you see for the first time some trace of hesitation on  the part of this self-confident prowler of the big woods. Once I  startled him on the shore, whither he had come to get the fore quarters  of a deer that had been left there. He jumped for cover at the first  alarm without even turning his head, just as he had seen his mother do,  a score of times, when he was a cub. Then he stopped, and for three or  four seconds considered the danger in plain sight--a thing I have never  seen any other bear imitate. He wavered for a moment more, doubtful  whether my canoe were swifter than he and more dangerous. Then satisfied  that, at least, he had a good chance, he jumped back, grabbed the deer,  and dragged it away into the woods.    Another time I met him on a narrow path where he could not pass me and  where he did not want to turn back, for something ahead was calling him  strongly. That short meeting furnished me the best study in bear nature  and bear instinct that I have ever been allowed to make. And, at this  distance, I have small desire to repeat the experience.    It was on the Little Sou'west Mirimichi, a very wild river, in the heart  of the wilderness. Just above my camp, not half a mile away, was a  salmon pool that, so far as I know, had never been fished. One bank of  the river was an almost sheer cliff, against which the current fretted  and hissed in a strong deep rush to the rapids and a great silent pool  far below. There were salmon under the cliff, plenty of them, balancing  themselves against the arrowy run of the current; but, so far as my  flies were concerned, they might as well have been in the Yukon. One  could not fish from the opposite shore--there was no room for a back  cast, and the current was too deep and swift for wading--and on the  shore where the salmon were there was no place to stand. If I had had a  couple of good Indians, I might have dropped down to the head of the  swift water and fished, while they held the canoe with poles braced on  the bottom; but I had no two good Indians, and the one I did have was  unwilling to take the risk. So we went hungry, almost within sight and  sound of the plunge of"]]]
