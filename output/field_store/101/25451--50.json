[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26500"],[0,"Anecdotes of Dogs (#9)"],[1," a point of honour never to begin, but on receiving a hint  from me; some one of his enemies was sure to commence the battle, and  then he or both of us would turn to as an oppressed party. I have seen  him walk leisurely out into the middle of a field where oxen were  grazing, and then throw himself down. Either a bull or the oxen were  sure to be attracted by the novel sight, and come dancing and blowing  round him. All this he used to bear with the most stoical fortitude,  till some one more forward than the rest touched him with the horn.  'War to the knife, and no favour,' was then the cry; and Grumbo had  one of them by the nose directly. He being engaged at odds, I of  course made in to help him, and such a scene of confusion used to  follow as was scarce ever seen. Grumbo tossed in the air, and then  some beast pinned by the nose would lie down and bellow. I should all  this time be swinging round on to some of their tails, and so it would  go on till Grumbo and myself were tired and our enemies happy to beat  a retreat. If he wished to pick a quarrel with a man, he would walk  listlessly before him till the man trod on him, and then the row  began. Grumbo was the best assistant, night or day, for catching  delinquents, in the world. As a proof of his thoughtful sagacity, I  give the following fact. He was my sole companion when I watched two  men steal a quantity of pheasants' eggs: we gave chase; but before I  could come near them, with two hundred yards start of me, they fled.  There was no hope of my overtaking them before they reached the  village of Harlington, so I gave Grumbo the office. Off he went, but  in the chase the men ran up a headland on which a cow was tethered.  They passed the cow; and when the dog came up to the cow he stopped,  and, to my horror, contemplated a grab at the tempting nose. He was,  however, uncertain as to whether or not this would be right, and he  looked back to me for further assurance. I made the sign to go ahead,  and he understood it, for he took up the running again, and  disappeared down a narrow pathway leading through the orchards to the  houses. When I turned that corner, to my infinite delight I found him  placed in the narrow path, directly in front of one of the poachers,  with such an evident determination of purpose, that the man was  standing stock still, afraid to stir either hand or foot. I came up  and secured the offender, and bade the dog be quiet.\"    It is, I believe, a fact, and if so, it is a curious one, that the dog  in a wild state only howls; but when he becomes the friend and  companion of man, he has then wants and wishes, hopes and fears, joys  and sorrows, to which in his wilder state he appears to have been a  stranger. His vocabulary, if it may be so called, then increases, in  order to express his enlarged and varying emotions. He anticipates  rewards and punishments, and learns to solicit the former and  deprecate the latter. He bounds exultingly forth to accompany his  master in his walks, rides, and sports of the field. He acts as the  faithful guardian of his property. He is his fire-side companion,  evidently discerns days of household mirth or grief, and deports  himself accordingly. Hence, his energies and his sensibilities are all  expanded, and what he feels he seeks to tell in various accents, and  in different ways. For instance, our little dog comes and pulls his  mistress's gown and makes significant whines, if any one is in or  about the premises whom he thinks has no right to be there. I have  seen a dog pick up a stick and bring it in his mouth to his master,  looking at the water first and then at his master, evidently that the  stick might be thrown into it, that he might have the pleasure of  swimming after it. In my younger days, I was in the habit of teazing a  favourite dog by twitching his nose and pretending to pull his ears.  He would snap gently at me, but if, by accident, he gave me rather a  harder bite than he had intended, he became instantly aware of it, and  expressed his regret in a way not to be mistaken. Dogs who have hurt  or cut themselves will submit patiently while the wound is being  dressed, however much the operation may hurt them. They become  instantly sensible that no punishment is intended to be inflicted, and  I have seen them lick the hand of the operator, as if grateful for  what he was doing. Those who are in the habit of having dogs  constantly in the room with them, will have perceived how alive they  are to the slightest change in the countenance of their master; how  gently they will touch him with their paw when he is eating, in order  to remind him of their own want of food; and how readily they  distinguish the movements of any inmate of the house from those of a  stranger. These, and many other circumstances which might be  mentioned, show a marked distinction between a domesticated dog and  one that is wild, or who has lived with people who are in an  uncivilized state, such as the Esquimaux, &c. Both the wild and  domestic dog, however, appear to be possessed of and to exercise  forethought. They will bury or hide food, which they are unable to  consume at once, and return for it. But the domestic dog, perhaps,  gives stronger proofs of forethought; and I will give an instance of  it. A large metal pot, turned on one side, in which a great quantity  of porridge had been boiled, was set before a Newfoundland puppy of  three or four months old. At first, he contented himself by licking  off portions of the oatmeal which adhered to the interior, but finding  this unsatisfactory, he scraped the morsels with his fore-paws into a  heap, and then ate the whole at once. I had a dog, who, having once  scalded his tongue, always afterwards, when I gave him his milk and  water at breakfast, put his paw very cautiously into the saucer, to  see if the liquid was too hot, before he would touch it with his  tongue.    Dogs have frequently been known to hunt in couples; that is, to assist  each other in securing their prey: thus associating together and  admitting of no partnership.    At Palermo, in Sicily, there is an extraordinary quantity of dogs  wandering about without owners. Amongst the number, two more  particularly distinguished themselves for their animosity to cats. One  day they were in pursuit of a cat, which, seeing no other place of  refuge near, made her escape into a long earthen water-pipe which was  lying on the ground. These two inseparable companions, who always  supported each other, pursued the cat to the pipe, where they were  seen to stop, and apparently to consult each other as to what was to  be done to deceive and get possession of the poor cat. After they had  stood a short time they divided, taking post at each end of the pipe,  and began to back alternately, thus giving the cat reason to suppose  that they were both at one end, in order to induce her to come out.  This manoeuvre had a successful result, and the cheated cat left her  hiding-place. Scarcely had she ventured out, when she was seized by  one of the dogs; the other hastened to his assistance, and in a few  moments deprived her of life.[C]    The memory of dogs is quite extraordinary, and only equalled by that  of the elephant. Mr. Swainson, in his work on the instincts of  animals, gives the following proof of this. He says that \"A spaniel  belonging to the Rev. H. N., being always told that he must not follow  his master to church on Sundays, used on those days to set off long  before the service, and lie concealed under the hedge, so near the  church, that at length the point was yielded to him.\" My little  parlour dog never offers to go with me on a Sunday, although on other  days he is perfectly wild to accompany me in my walks.    In my younger days I had a favourite dog, which always accompanied me  to church. My mother, seeing that he attracted too much of my  attention, ordered the servant to shut him every Sunday morning. This  was done once, but never afterwards; for he concealed himself early  every Sunday morning, and I was sure to find him either under my seat  at church, or else at the church-door. That dogs clearly distinguish  the return of Sunday cannot be doubted.    The almost incredible penetration and expedition with which dogs are  known to return to their former homes, from places to which they have  been sent, or carried in such a recluse way as not to retain a trace  of the road, will ever continue to excite the greatest admiration.    A dog having been given by a gentleman at Wivenhoe to the captain of a  collier, he took the dog on board his vessel, and landed him at  Sunderland; but soon after his arrival there the dog was missing, and  in a very few days arrived at the residence of his old master, in  Essex. A still more extraordinary circumstance is upon record, of the  late Colonel Hardy, who, having been sent for express to Bath, was  accompanied by a favourite spaniel bitch in his chaise, which he never  quitted till his arrival there. After remaining there four days, he  accidentally left his spaniel behind him, and returned to his  residence at Springfield, in Essex, with equal expedition; where, in  three days after, his faithful and steady adherent arrived also,  notwithstanding the distance between that place and Bath is 140 miles,  and she had to explore her way through London, to which she had never  been, except in her passage to Bath, and then within the confines of a  close carriage.[D]    In the small town of Melbourne, in Derbyshire, cocks and hens may be  seen running about the streets. One day a game cock attacked a small  bantam, and they fought furiously, the bantam having, of course, the  worst of it. Some persons were standing about looking at the fight,  when my informant's house-dog suddenly darted out, snatched up the  bantam in his mouth, and carried it into the house. Several of the  spectators followed, believing that the poor fowl"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26556"],[0,"Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (#9)"],[1,"any number of horary questions can be  asked. It is on account of their skill in horary astrology that the  Zadkiels of our own time have occasionally found their way into the  twelfth house, or House of Enemies. Even Lilly himself, not devoting, it  would seem, five minutes to inquire into the probable success of the  affair, was indicted in 1655 by a half-witted young woman, because he  had given judgment respecting stolen goods, receiving two shillings and  sixpence, contrary to an Act made under and provided by the wise and  virtuous King James, First of England and Sixth of Scotland.    State astrology relates to the destinies of kingdoms, thrones, empires,  and may be regarded as a branch of horary science relating to subjects  (and rulers) of more than ordinary importance.    In former ages all persons likely to occupy an important position in the  history of the world had their horoscopes erected; but in these  degenerate days neither the casting of nativities nor the art of ruling  the planets flourishes as it should do. Our Zadkiels and Raphaels  publish, indeed, the horoscopes of kings and emperors, princes and  princesses, and so forth; but their fate is as that of Benedict  (according to Beatrice)--men 'wonder they will still be talking, for  nobody marks them.' Even those whose horoscopes have been erected show  no proper respect for the predictions made in their behalf. Thus the  Prince of Wales being born when Sagittarius was in the ascendant should  have been, according to Zadkiel, a tall man, with oval face, ruddy  complexion, somewhat dusky, and so forth; but I understand he has by no  means followed these directions as to his appearance. The sun, being  well aspected, prognosticated honours--a most remarkable and  unlooked-for circumstance, strangely fulfilled by the event; but then  being in Cancer, in sextile with Mars, the Prince of Wales was to be  partial to maritime affairs and attain naval glory, whereas as a  field-marshal he can only win military glory. (I would not be understood  to say that he is not quite as competent to lead our fleets as our  battalions into action.) The House of Wealth was occupied by Jupiter,  aspected by Saturn, which betokened great wealth through inheritance--a  prognostication, says Professor Miller, which is not unlikely to come  true. The House of Marriage was unsettled by the conflicting influences  of Venus, Mars, and Saturn; but the first predominating, the Prince,  after some trouble in his matrimonial speculations, was to marry a  Princess of high birth, and one not undeserving of his kindest and most  affectionate attention, probably in 1862. As to the date, an almanack  informs me that the Prince married a Danish Princess in March 1863,  which looks like a most culpable neglect of the predictions of our  national astrologer. Again, in May 1870, when Saturn was stationary in  the ascending degree, the Prince ought to have been injured by a horse,  and also to have received a blow on the left side of the head, near the  ear; but reprehensibly omitted both these ceremonies. A predisposition  to fever and epileptic attacks was indicated by the condition of the  House of Sickness. The newspapers described, a few years since, a  serious attack of fever; but as most persons have some experience of the  kind, the fulfilment of the prediction can hardly be regarded as very  wonderful. Epileptic attacks, which, as less common, might have saved  the credit of the astrologers, have not visited 'this royal native.' The  position of Saturn in Capricorn betokened loss or disaster in one or  other of the places ruled over by Capricorn--which, as we have seen, are  India, Macedonia, Thrace, Greece, Mexico, Saxony, Wilna, Mecklenburgh,  Brandenburgh, and Oxford. Professor Miller expresses the hope that  Oxford was the place indicated, and the disaster nothing more serious  than some slight scrape with the authorities of Christchurch. But  princes never get into scrapes with college dons. Probably some one or  other of the 'hair-breadth 'scapes' chronicled by the reporters of his  travels in India was the event indicated by the ominous position of  Saturn in Capricorn.    A remarkable list of characteristics were derived by Zadkiel from the  positions of the various planets and signs in the twelve houses of the  'royal native.' Some, of course, were indicated in more ways than one,  which will explain the parenthetical notes in the following alphabetical  table which Professor Miller has been at the pains to draw up from  Zadkiel's predictions. The prince was to be 'acute, affectionate,  amiable, amorous, austere, avaricious, beneficent, benevolent, brave,  brilliant, calculated for government' (a quality which may be understood  two ways), 'candid, careful of his person, careless, compassionate,  courteous (twice over), delighting in eloquence, discreet, envious, fond  of glory, fond of learning, fond of music, fond of poetry, fond of  sports, fond of the arts and sciences, frank, full of expedients,  generous (three times), gracious, honourable, hostile to crime,  impervious, ingenious, inoffensive, joyous, just (twice), laborious,  liberal, lofty, magnanimous, modest, noble, not easy to be understood  (!), parsimonious, pious (twice), profound in opinion, prone to regret  his acts, prudent, rash, religious, reverent, self-confident, sincere,  singular in mode of thinking, strong, temperate, unreserved, unsteady,  valuable in friendship, variable, versatile, violent, volatile, wily,  and worthy.' Zadkiel concludes thus:--'The square of Saturn to the moon  will add to the gloomy side of the picture, and give a tinge of  melancholy at times to the native's character, and also a disposition to  look at the dark side of things, and lead him to despondency; nor will  he be at all of a sanguine character, but cool and calculating, though  occasionally rash. Yet, all things considered, though firm and sometimes  positive in opinion, this royal native, if he live to mount the throne,  will sway the sceptre of these realms in moderation and justice, and be  a pious and benevolent man, and a merciful sovereign.' Fortunately, the  time has long since passed when swaying the sceptre of these realms had  any but a figurative meaning, or when Englishmen who obeyed their  country's laws depended on the mercy of any man, or when even bad  citizens were judged by princes. But we still prefer that princes should  be well-mannered gentlemen, and therefore it is sincerely to be hoped  that Zadkiel's prediction, so far as it relates to piety and  benevolence, may be fulfilled, should this 'royal native' live to mount  the throne. As for mercy, it is a goodly quality even in these days and  in this country; for if the law no longer tolerates cruelty to men, even  on the part of princes, who once had prescribed rights in that  direction, there are still some cruel, nay brutal sports in which 'royal  natives' might sometimes be tempted to take part. Wherefore let us hope  that, even in regard to mercy, the predictions of astrologers respecting  this 'royal native' may be fulfilled.    Passing however, from trivialities, let us consider the lessons which  the history of astrology teaches us respecting the human mind, its  powers and weaknesses. It has been well remarked by Whewell that for  many ages 'mysticism in its various forms was a leading character both  of the common mind and the speculations of the most intelligent and  profound reasoners.' Thus mysticism was the opposite of that habit of  thought which science requires, 'namely, clear ideas, distinctly  employed to connect well-ascertained facts; inasmuch as the ideas in  which it dealt were vague and unstable, and the temper in which they  were contemplated was an urgent and aspiring enthusiasm, which could not  submit to a calm conference with experience upon even terms.' We have  seen what has been the history of one particular form of the mysticism  of ancient and mediaeval ages. If we had followed the history of alchemy,  magic, and other forms of mysticism, we should have seen similar  results. True science has gradually dispossessed science falsely so  called, until now none but the weaker minds hold by the tenets formerly  almost universally adopted. In mere numbers, believers in the ancient  superstitions may be by no means insignificant; but they no longer have  any influence. It has become a matter of shame to pay any attention to  what those few say or do who not merely hold but proclaim the ancient  faith in these matters. We can also see why this has been. In old times  enthusiasm usurped the place of reason in these cases; but opinions so  formed and so retained could not maintain their ground in the presence  of reasoning and experience. So soon as intelligent and thoughtful men  perceived that facts were against the supposed mysterious influences of  the stars, the asserted powers of magicians, the pretended knowledge of  alchemists, the false teachings of magic, alchemy, and astrology, were  rejected. The lesson thus learned respecting erroneous doctrines which  were once widely prevalent has its application in our time, when, though  the influence of those teachings has passed away, other doctrines  formerly associated with them still hold their ground. Men in old times,  influenced by erroneous teachings, wasted their time and energies in  idle questionings of the stars, vain efforts to find Arcana of  mysterious power, and to acquire magical authority over the elements. Is  it altogether clear that in these our times men are not hampered,  prevented to some degree from doing all the good they might do in the  short life-time allotted to them, by doctrines of another kind? Is there  in our day no undue sacrifice of present good in idle questionings? is  there no tendency to trust in a vain fetishism to prevent or remove  evils which energy could avert or remedy? The time will come, in my  belief, when "]]]
