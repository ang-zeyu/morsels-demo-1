Economic considerations have played second fiddle to    political and military upheavals during two decades of war,    including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended    15 February 1989). During that conflict one-third of the population    fled the country, with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak    of more than 6 million refugees. Now, only 750,000 registered Afghan    refugees remain in Pakistan and about 1.2 million in Iran. Another 1    million have probably moved into and around urban areas within    Afghanistan. Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over    the past 20 years because of the loss of labor and capital and the    disruption of trade and transport. Much of the population continues    to suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical    care. Inflation remains a serious problem throughout the country,    with one estimate putting the rate at 240% in Kabul in 1996.    International aid can deal with only a fraction of the humanitarian    problem, let alone promote economic development. Government efforts    to encourage foreign investment have not worked. The economic    situation did not improve in 1998. Numerical data are likely to be    either unavailable or unreliable.    GDP: purchasing power parity--$20 billion (1998 est.)

Dr. Fisher was called in the middle of the morning to see what was the  matter with Polly's eyes. The little man looked at her keenly over his  spectacles; then he said, \"When were you taken?\"    \"This morning,\" answered Polly, her eyes smarting.    \"Didn't you feel badly before?\" questioned the doctor. Polly thought  back; and then she remembered that she had felt very badly; that when  she was baking over the old stove the day before her back had ached  dreadfully; and that, somehow, when she sat down to sew, it didn't stop;  only her eyes had bothered her so; she didn't mind her back so much.    \"I thought so,\" said the doctor, when Polly answered. \"And those eyes  of yours have been used too much; what has she been doing, ma'am?\" He  turned around sharply on Mrs. Pepper as he asked this.    \"Sewing,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"and everything; Polly does everything,  sir.\"    \"Humph!\" said the doctor; \"well, she won't again in one spell; her eyes  are very bad.\"    At this a whoop, small but terrible to hear, came from the middle of the  bed; and Phronsie sat bolt upright. Everybody started; while Phronsie  broke out, \"Don't make my Polly sick! oh! please don't!\"    \"Hey!\" said the doctor; and he looked kindly at the small object with  a very red face in the middle of the bed. Then he added, gently, \"We're  going to make Polly well, little girl; so that she can see splendidly.\"    \"Will you, really?\" asked the child, doubtfully.    \"Yes,\" said the doctor; \"we'll try hard; and you mustn't cry; 'cause  then Polly'll cry, and that will make her eyes very bad; very bad  indeed,\" he repeated, impressively.    \"I won't cry,\" said Phronsie; \"no, not one bit.\" And she wiped off the  last tear with her fat little hand, and watched to see what next was to  be done.      And Polly was left, very rebellious indeed, in the big bed, with a  cooling lotion on the poor eyes, that somehow didn't cool them one bit.    \"If 'twas anythin' but my eyes, mammy, I could stand it,\" she bewailed,  flouncing over and over in her impatience; \"and who'll do all the work  now?\"    \"Don't think of the work, Polly,\" said Mrs. Pepper.    \"I can't do anything but think,\" said poor Polly.    Just at that moment a queer noise out in the kitchen was heard.    \"Do go out, mother, and see what 'tis,\" said Polly.    \"I've come,\" said a cracked voice, close up by the bedroom door,  followed by a big black cap, which could belong to no other than Grandma  Bascom, \"to set by you a spell; what's the matter?\" she asked, and  stopped, amazed to see Polly in bed.    \"Oh, Polly's taken,\" screamed Mrs. Pepper in her ear.    \"Taken!\" repeated the old lady, \"what is it--a fit?\"    \"No,\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"the same as Ben's got; and Phronsie; the  measles.\"    \"The measles, has she?\" said grandma; \"well, that's bad; and Ben's away,  you say.\"    \"No, he isn't either,\" screamed Mrs. Pepper, \"he's got them, too!\"    \"Got two what?\" asked grandma.    \"Measles! he's got the measles too,\" repeated Mrs. Pepper, loud as she  could; so loud that the old lady's cap trembled at the noise.    \"Oh! the dreadful!\" said grandma; \"and this girl too?\" laying her hand  on Phronsie's head.    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pepper, feeling it a little relief to tell over her  miseries; \"all three of them!\"    \"I haven't,\" said Joel, coming in in hopes that grandma had a stray  peppermint or two in her pocket, as she sometimes did; \"and I'm not  going to, either.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" groaned his mother; \"that's what Polly said; and she's  got 'em bad. It's her eyes,\" she screamed to grandma, who looked  inquiringly.    \"Her eyes, is it?\" asked Mrs. Bascom; \"well, I've got a receet that  cousin Samanthy's folks had when John's children had 'em; and I'll run  right along home and get it,\" and she started to go.    \"No, you needn't,\" screamed Mrs. Pepper; \"thank you, Mrs. Bascom; but  Dr. Fisher's been here; and he put something on Polly's eyes; and he  said it mustn't be touched.\"    \"Hey?\" said the old lady; so Mrs. Pepper had to go all over it again,  till at last she made her understand that Polly's eyes were taken care  of, and they must wait for time to do the rest.    \"You come along of me,\" whispered grandma, when at last her call was  done, to Joel who stood by the door. \"I've got some peppermints to home;  I forgot to bring 'em.\"    \"Yes'm,\" said Joel, brightening up.    \"Where you going, Joe?\" asked Mrs. Pepper, seeing him move off with Mrs.  Bascom; \"I may want you.\"    \"Oh, I've got to go over to grandma's,\" said Joel briskly; \"she wants  me.\"    \"Well, don't be gone long then,\" replied his mother.    \"There,\" said grandma, going into her \"keeping-room\" to an old-fashioned  chest of drawers; opening one, she took therefrom a paper, from which  she shook out before Joe's delighted eyes some red and white peppermint  drops. \"There now, you take these home; you may have some, but be  sure you give the most to the sick ones; and Polly--let Polly have the  biggest.\"    \"She won't take 'em,\" said Joel, wishing he had the measles. \"Well, you  try her,\" said grandma; \"run along now.\" But it was useless to tell Joel  that, for he was half-way home already. He carried out grandma's wishes,  and distributed conscientiously the precious drops. But when he came to  Polly, she didn't answer; and looking at her in surprise he saw two big  tears rolling out under the bandage and wetting the pillow.    \"I don't want 'em, Joe,\" said Polly, when he made her understand that  \"twas peppermints, real peppermints;\" \"you may have 'em.\"    \"Try one, Polly; they're real good,\" said Joel, who had an undefined  wish to comfort; \"there, open your mouth.\"    So Polly opened her mouth, and Joel put one in with satisfaction.    \"Isn't it good?\" he asked, watching her crunch it.    \"Yes,\" said Polly, \"real good; where'd you get 'em?\"    \"Over to Grandma Bascom's,\" said Joel; \"she gave me lots for all of us;  have another, Polly?\"    \"No,\" said Polly, \"not yet; you put two on my pillow where I can reach  'em; and then you keep the rest, Joel.\"    \"I'll put three,\" said Joel, counting out one red and two white ones,  and laying them on the pillow; \"there!\"    \"And I want another, Joey, I do,\" said Phronsie from the other side of  the bed.    \"Well, you may have one,\" said Joel; \"a red one, Phronsie; yes, you may  have two. Now come on, Dave; we'll have the rest out by the wood-pile.\"    How they ever got through that day, I don't know. But late in the  afternoon carriage wheels were heard; and then they stopped right at the  Peppers' little brown gate.    \"Polly,\" said Mrs. Pepper, running to the bedroom door, \"it's Mrs.  Henderson!\"    \"Is it?\" said Polly, from the darkened room, \"oh! I'm so glad! is Miss  Jerushy with her?\" she asked, fearfully.    \"No,\" said Mrs. Pepper, going back to ascertain; \"why, it's the parson  himself! Deary! how we look!\"    \"Never mind, mammy,\" called back Polly, longing to spring out of bed and  fix up a bit.    \"I'm sorry to hear the children are sick,\" said Mrs. Henderson, coming  in, in her sweet, gentle way.    \"We didn't know it,\" said the minister, \"until this morning--can we see  them?\"    \"Oh yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"Ben's upstairs; and Polly and Phronsie  are in here.\"    \"Poor little things!\" said Mrs. Henderson, compassionately; \"hadn't you  better,\" turning to the minister, \"go up and see Ben first, while I will  visit the little girls?\"    So the minister mounted the crooked stairs; and Mrs. Henderson went  straight up to Polly's side; and the first thing Polly knew, a cool,  gentle hand was laid on her hot head, and a voice said, \"I've come to  see my little chicken now!\"    \"Oh, ma'am,\" said Polly, bursting into a sob, \"I don't care about my  eyes--only mammy--\" and she broke right down.    \"I know,\" said the minister's wife, soothingly; \"but it's for you to  bear patiently, Polly--what do you suppose the chicks were doing when I  came away?\" And Mrs. Henderson, while she held Polly's hand, smiled and  nodded encouragingly to Phronsie, who was staring at her from the other  side of the bed.    \"I don't know, ma'am,\" said Polly; \"please tell us.\"    \"Well, they were all fighting over a grasshopper--yes, ten of them.\"    \"Which one got it?\" asked Polly in intense interest; \"oh! I hope the  white one did!\"    \"Well, he looked as much like winning as any of them,\" said the lady,  laughing.    \"Bless her!\" thought Mrs. Pepper to herself out in the kitchen,  finishing the sack Polly had left; \"she's a parson's wife, I say!\"    And then the minister came down from Ben's room, and went into the  bedroom; and Mrs. Henderson went up-stairs into the loft.    \"So,\" he said kindly, as after patting Phronsie's head he came over and  sat down by Polly, \"this is the little girl who came to see me when I  was sick.\"    \"Oh, sir,\" said Polly, \"I'm so glad you wasn't!\"    \"Well, when I come again,\" said Mr. Henderson, rising after a merry  chat, \"I see I shall have to slip a book into my pocket, and read for  those poor eyes.\"    \"Oh, thank you!\" cried Polly; and then she stopped and blushed.    \"Well, what is it?\" asked the minister, encouragingly.    \"Ben loves to hear reading,\" said Polly.    \"Does he? well, by that time, my little girl, I guess Ben will be  down-stairs; he's all right, Polly; don't you worry about him--and I'll  sit in the kitchen, by the bedroom door, and you can hear nicely.\"    So the Hendersons went away. But somehow, before they went, a good many  things found their way out of the old-fashioned chaise into the Peppers'  little kitchen.    But Polly's eyes didn't get any better, with all the care; and the lines  of worry on Mrs. Pepper's face grew deeper and deeper. At last, she just  "]]]
