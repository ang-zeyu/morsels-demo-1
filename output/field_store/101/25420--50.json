I cannot comprehend how  a man can be so mad as to shoot himself, and the bare idea of it shocks  me.\"    \"But why should any one,\" said I, \"in speaking of an action, venture  to pronounce it mad or wise, or good or bad? What is the meaning of all  this? Have you carefully studied the secret motives of our actions? Do  you understand--can you explain the causes which occasion them, and make  them inevitable? If you can, you will be less hasty with your decision.\"    \"But you will allow,\" said Albert; \"that some actions are criminal, let  them spring from whatever motives they may.\" I granted it, and shrugged  my shoulders.    \"But still, my good friend,\" I continued, \"there are some exceptions  here too. Theft is a crime; but the man who commits it from extreme  poverty, with no design but to save his family from perishing, is he an  object of pity, or of punishment? Who shall throw the first stone at a  husband, who, in the heat of just resentment, sacrifices his faithless  wife and her perfidious seducer? or at the young maiden, who, in her  weak hour of rapture, forgets herself in the impetuous joys of love?  Even our laws, cold and cruel as they are, relent in such cases, and  withhold their punishment.\"    \"That is quite another thing,\" said Albert; \"because a man under the  influence of violent passion loses all power of reflection, and is  regarded as intoxicated or insane.\"    \"Oh! you people of sound understandings,\" I replied, smiling, \"are ever  ready to exclaim 'Extravagance, and madness, and intoxication!' You  moral men are so calm and so subdued! You abhor the drunken man, and  detest the extravagant; you pass by, like the Levite, and thank God,  like the Pharisee, that you are not like one of them. I have been more  than once intoxicated, my passions have always bordered on extravagance:  I am not ashamed to confess it; for I have learned, by my own  experience, that all extraordinary men, who have accomplished great and  astonishing actions, have ever been decried by the world as drunken or  insane. And in private life, too, is it not intolerable that no one can  undertake the execution of a noble or generous deed, without giving rise  to the exclamation that the doer is intoxicated or mad? Shame upon you,  ye sages!\"    \"This is another of your extravagant humours,\" said Albert: \"you always  exaggerate a case, and in this matter you are undoubtedly wrong; for we  were speaking of suicide, which you compare with great actions, when it  is impossible to regard it as anything but a weakness. It is much easier  to die than to bear a life of misery with fortitude.\"    I was on the point of breaking off the conversation, for nothing puts me  so completely out of patience as the utterance of a wretched commonplace  when I am talking from my inmost heart. However, I composed myself, for  I had often heard the same observation with sufficient vexation; and  I answered him, therefore, with a little warmth, \"You call this a  weakness--beware of being led astray by appearances. When a nation,  which has long groaned under the intolerable yoke of a tyrant, rises at  last and throws off its chains, do you call that weakness? The man  who, to rescue his house from the flames, finds his physical strength  redoubled, so that he lifts burdens with ease, which, in the absence of  excitement, he could scarcely move; he who, under the rage of an insult,  attacks and puts to flight half a score of his enemies, are such persons  to be called weak? My good friend, if resistance be strength, how can  the highest degree of resistance be a weakness?\"    Albert looked steadfastly at me, and said, \"Pray forgive me, but I do  not see that the examples you have adduced bear any relation to the  question.\" \"Very likely,\" I answered; \"for I have often been told that  my style of illustration borders a little on the absurd. But let us see  if we cannot place the matter in another point of view, by inquiring  what can be a man's state of mind who resolves to free himself from  the burden of life,--a burden often so pleasant to bear,--for we cannot  otherwise reason fairly upon the subject.    \"Human nature,\" I continued, \"has its limits. It is able to endure a  certain degree of joy, sorrow, and pain, but becomes annihilated as soon  as this measure is exceeded. The question, therefore, is, not whether a  man is strong or weak, but whether he is able to endure the measure  of his sufferings. The suffering may be moral or physical; and in  my opinion it is just as absurd to call a man a coward who destroys  himself, as to call a man a coward who dies of a malignant fever.\"    \"Paradox, all paradox!\" exclaimed Albert. \"Not so paradoxical as you  imagine,\" I replied. \"You allow that we designate a disease as mortal  when nature is so severely attacked, and her strength so far exhausted,  that she cannot possibly recover her former condition under any change  that may take place.    \"Now, my good friend, apply this to the mind; observe a man in  his natural, isolated condition; consider how ideas work, and how  impressions fasten on him, till at length a violent passion seizes him,  destroying all his powers of calm reflection, and utterly ruining him.    \"It is in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understands the  condition of such a wretched being, in vain he counsels him. He can no  more communicate his own wisdom to him than a healthy man can instil his  strength into the invalid, by whose bedside he is seated.\"    Albert thought this too general. I reminded him of a girl who had  drowned herself a short time previously, and I related her history.    She was a good creature, who had grown up in the narrow sphere of  household industry and weekly appointed labour; one who knew no pleasure  beyond indulging in a walk on Sundays, arrayed in her best attire,  accompanied by her friends, or perhaps joining in the dance now and then  at some festival, and chatting away her spare hours with a neighbour,  discussing the scandal or the quarrels of the village, trifles  sufficient to occupy her heart. At length the warmth of her nature is  influenced by certain new and unknown wishes. Inflamed by the flatteries  of men, her former pleasures become by degrees insipid, till at length  she meets with a youth to whom she is attracted by an indescribable  feeling; upon him she now rests all her hopes; she forgets the world  around her; she sees, hears, desires nothing but him, and him only. He  alone occupies all her thoughts. Uncorrupted by the idle indulgence of  an enervating vanity, her affection moving steadily toward its object,  she hopes to become his, and to realise, in an everlasting union with  him, all that happiness which she sought, all that bliss for which  she longed. His repeated promises confirm her hopes: embraces and  endearments, which increase the ardour of her desires, overmaster her  soul. She floats in a dim, delusive anticipation of her happiness; and  her feelings become excited to their utmost tension. She stretches out  her arms finally to embrace the object of all her wishes and her lover  forsakes her. Stunned and bewildered, she stands upon a precipice. All  is darkness around her. No prospect, no hope, no consolation--forsaken  by him in whom her existence was centred! She sees nothing of the wide  world before her, thinks nothing of the many individuals who might  supply the void in her heart; she feels herself deserted, forsaken by  the world; and, blinded and impelled by the agony which wrings her soul,  she plunges into the deep, to end her sufferings in the broad embrace of  death. See here, Albert, the history of thousands; and tell me, is not  this a case of physical infirmity? Nature has no way to escape from the  labyrinth: her powers are exhausted: she can contend no longer, and the  poor soul must die.    \"Shame upon him who can look on calmly, and exclaim, 'The foolish girl!  she should have waited; she should have allowed time to wear off the  impression; her despair would have been softened, and she would have  found another lover to comfort her.' One might as well say, 'The fool,  to die of a fever! why did he not wait till his strength was restored,  till his blood became calm? all would then have gone well, and he would  have been alive now.'\"    Albert, who could not see the justice of the comparison, offered some  further objections, and, amongst others, urged that I had taken the  case of a mere ignorant girl. But how any man of sense, of more enlarged  views and experience, could be excused, he was unable to comprehend. \"My  friend!\" I exclaimed, \"man is but man; and, whatever be the extent  of his reasoning powers, they are of little avail when passion rages  within, and he feels himself confined by the narrow limits of nature.  It were better, then--but we will talk of this some other time,\" I said,  and caught up my hat. Alas! my heart was full; and we parted without  conviction on either side. How rarely in this world do men understand  each other!    AUGUST 15.    There can be no doubt that in this world nothing is so indispensable as  love. I observe that Charlotte could not lose me without a pang, and the  very children have but one wish; that is, that I should visit them again  to-morrow. I went this afternoon to tune Charlotte's piano. But I could  not do it, for the little ones insisted on my telling them a story; and  Charlotte herself urged me to satisfy them. I waited upon them at tea,  and they are now as fully contented with me as with Charlotte; and  I told them my very best tale of the princess who was waited upon by  dwarfs. I improve myself by this exercise, and am quite surprised at the  impression my stories create.

It was to be called \"Altneuland.\" He  began to write it in 1899. It was completed in April 1902, and  published six months later. It is remarkable that he could write such  a novel while engaged in varied political activities in  Constantinople, in London and in Berlin; and while he had to deal with  the many troublesome internal Zionist problems.    \"Altneuland\" was a novel with a purpose. It described the Palestine of  the near future as it would develop through the Zionist Movement. It  had the weaknesses of every propaganda novel. The entire work has  something of the state about it and proceeds in the form of scenes  rather than by way of narrative. Each type has a specific outlook.  Most of the characters are portraits of living personalities. It was  his purpose to memorialize his friends and his opponents.    \"Altneuland\" tells of a Jew who visits Palestine in 1898 and then  comes again in 1923 when he finds the Promised Land developed under  Jewish influence. Its territory lies East and West of the Jordan. The  dead land of 1898 is now thoroughly alive. Its real creators were the  irrigation engineers. Technology had given a new form to labor, a new  social and economic system had been created which is described as  \"mutualistic,\" a huge cooperative, a mediate form between  individualism and collectivism. Haifa had become a world city. Around  the Holy City of Jerusalem, modern suburbs had arisen, shaded  boulevards and parks, institutes of learning, places of amusement,  markets--\"a world city in the spirit of the twentieth century.\" In  this new land, the Arabs live side by side in friendship with the  Jews.    \"Altneuland\" did not produce the effect Herzl had expected. Within the  Zionist Movement it did more harm than good. Many of Herzl's friends  were disappointed that the novel should have so little of the Jewish  spirit. It ignored the Hebraic renaissance. The novel evoked the  sharpest criticism from Achad Haam.           *       *       *       *       *    While Herzl was immersed in political action, visiting European  capitals, carrying on correspondence with leading persons whose  interest in Zionism he had engaged, and submitting reports to the  Zionist Congress or to the Actions Committee, often facing critical  situations in his struggle with growing Zionist parties, the Zionist  Organization was gradually becoming an accepted institution in Jewish  life. It was the international sounding board for the discussion of  the Jewish question. The Jewish National Fund was founded at the  Fourth Congress held in London in 1900. The Jewish Colonial Trust was  finally established with headquarters in London.    The first Zionist party in the Congress was the Democratic faction led  by Leo Motzkin, but soon there were added the Mizrachi party and the  beginnings of a labor party. Not only Dr. Nordau's stirring addresses,  but many controversies \"made\" Congresses. The cultural issue was a  Congress perennial. Many discussions also took place around what was  called the issue of \"practical\" and \"political\" Zionism. The Russians,  under the leadership of Ussishkin, were all heartily against the  \"charter\" emphasis and drove with maddening persistence for immediate  work in Palestine. In the course of these debates, continued over the  years, the Congress became a forum for the discussion of international  Jewish problems and developed speakers and theorists of varying  degrees of talent. It also produced men with hobbies. The Jewish  National Fund and the Hebrew University was the hobby of Dr. Herman  Schapiro. Colonization in Cyprus was the hobby of Davis Trietsch, who  created many scenes on the floor of the Congress. Dr. Chaim Weizmann  was not only a leader of the Democratic faction, crossing swords time  and again with Herzl, but devoted much time and thought to the idea of  a Hebrew University. The procedure of the Congress, based on  Continental models, was gradually worked out and became fixed, and  many of the delegates were adepts in the art of procedural sparring.  The language in Congresses used during Herzl's life was German, but  gradually the imperfect use of German by East European Zionists led to  the development of what was called \"Congress German.\" This was a form  of German that was easy to use, because respect for grammar and  pronunciation was not required.    During the Congresses Herzl maintained throughout the role of leader  and moderator. His manner was gracious and he never lost his sense of  dignity. He was capable of sharp retort, but always bore in mind that  it was high duty to hold a balance and to seek compromise rather than  sharp division. He developed it in a most remarkable way on the  platform. His appearances were dramatic. His interventions were  arresting. The man of the writing desk developed as one of the ablest  in the parliamentary arts. After some of the Congresses he had to  retire to a health resort, having exhausted his strength and bringing  on a recurrence of his heart trouble. On a number of occasions his  close friends feared for his life. But after a few weeks of rest he  usually returned stronger than before and with greater determination  to pursue his course, regardless of the consequences to himself.           *       *       *       *       *    At this point it is important to refer to his family life. He had  married Julie Naschauer on July 25, 1889. She was the daughter of  wealthy parents and grew up in a conventional social circle. When she  married Herzl he was already a rising young author who was highly  regarded among those with whom she associated. He was attractive,  aristocratic in bearing, a keen conversationalist and had all the  qualities of being a conventional partner of a conventional wife. But  Herzl threw himself into Zionist affairs with such tremendous dynamic  activity and was so completely absorbed in the idea which his thinking  had given birth to, that except for occasional interim periods, his  family played a secondary part in his life ever after he had taken up  the Jewish problems his special task in life. Julie Herzl also  suffered by reason of Herzl's devotion to his own mother. Herzl never  rid himself of his filial dependence which made it very hard for his  wife to understand. They had three children. In 1890 a daughter was  born and named Paula or Pauline. In 1891 his son, Hans, was born,  whose life after his father's death became a serious problem. There  was a third child, a daughter Margaret, known as Trude, who was born  in May 1893. During this period there were many separations from his  family. There were disagreements and reconciliations, but the cup of  unhappiness for Julie Herzl overflowed when Herzl became the official  leader of a public movement. From that time on her home was constantly  overrun with unwelcome visitors. Not only did Herzl give his life to  the movement in the literal sense, but he gave his reserve of funds  and sacrificed the welfare of his family for the sake of the movement  he had brought to life. His domestic affairs as well as his failing  heart, made all the years of Herzl's brief Zionist life pain and  struggle.    The tragic position of Jews in various parts of Europe, greatly  agitated Herzl during the time he was carrying on negotiations with  the Kaiser and the Sultan. He was constantly being led to the thought  that it would become necessary to find a temporary haven of refuge for  Jews. In 1899 a series of pogroms broke out in Galicia. In his diary  at the time, he had references to England and Cyprus, \"we may even  have to consider South Africa or America.\" But he banished these  thoughts from his mind because he knew that the Zionists would place  serious obstacles in the way of considering any project other than  Palestine. When his hopes with regard to Germany had collapsed,  however, he thought of these alternative proposals again.           *       *       *       *       *    On October 22, 1902 a Conference between Joseph Chamberlain, the  Colonial Secretary, and Herzl took place. Chamberlain had been in the  Colonial Office since 1895. He held an influential position in the  councils of the British Government. He was a man of strong will and  political integrity. Herzl submitted his plan for the colonization of  Cyprus and the Sinai Peninsula, which included El Arish--\"Jewish  settlers under a Jewish administration.\"    Chamberlain said that he could speak definitely only about Cyprus. The  Sinai Peninsula came under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Office. As  far as Cyprus was concerned, he believed that it was not promising  because the Greeks and Moslems would object, and it would be his  official duty to side with them. He took a more favorable view,  however, of El Arish. In that connection, it was necessary for Herzl  to talk to Lord Lansdowne of the Foreign Office. A great deal would  depend upon the good-will of Lord Cromer, the British Consul General  in Egypt, and actually the Vice Regent of that country. Through the  good offices of Chamberlain, it became possible for Herzl to meet  Lord Lansdowne a few days later. He was well received and was  listened to with a great deal of attention.    Herzl was asked to submit a written expose. Then he asked for  permission to have Leopold J. Greenberg go to Egypt and confer with  Lord Cromer. Lord Lansdowne said that he would arrange for such a  meeting. Greenberg discussed the matter with Lord Cromer in Cairo.  There were objections raised by both Lord Cromer and the Egyptian  Prime Minister on the ground that an attempted Jewish economy,  undertaken in 1891-2 in the region of ancient Midian, had been a  pitiful failure. There had been political complications and border  disputes with Turkey.    A definitive reply was received by Herzl on December 18, 1902 written  on behalf of Lord Lansdowne by Sir T.H. Sanderson,"]]]
