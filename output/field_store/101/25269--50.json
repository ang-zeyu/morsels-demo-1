Its motto still is \"Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the Word,\"  and its seal emblems have been thus interpreted: \"The employment of  these four emblems (fish, bird, tree, bell) in connection with St.  Kentigern was meant to convey that he was sent as a fisher of men, that  his work from small beginnings grew to very large dimensions, 'like to  a grain of mustard-seed, ... which is the least indeed of all seeds, but  when it is grown up ... becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air  come and dwell in the branches thereof'; and that his name and fame  became so great that he was heard of everywhere. 'Verily their sound  hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the  whole world.'\"[87]    The most beautiful features of the exterior are pronounced to be the  doorways, especially those of the lower church,[88] the vaulting of  which was said by Sir Gilbert Scott to contain nowhere two compartments  in juxtaposition which are alike.[89] It has been suggested that the  motive of the architect was to reproduce, as nearly as circumstances  permitted, the plan of Solomon's Temple, and the arrangement corresponds  exactly.[90] The beauty of the lower church is much obscured by the dark  stained glass in the windows, and it is matter for regret that this  masterpiece of design and wonderful variety of effect[91] are not more  visible.    \"The plan of the cathedral,\" says Mr. Honeyman, \"is remarkably compact,  and the exterior is symmetrical and harmonious. The best points of view  are from the north-east and the south-east. From either of these points  the full height of the structure is seen, and that is sufficiently great  to give the building a dignified and impressive effect, the height from  the ground-level to the apex of the choir gable being 115 feet. The  well-proportioned short transept breaks the monotony of the long  clerestory, without unduly hiding it, as transepts with more projections  do. The gable of the choir, with its four lancets, rises picturesquely  over the double eastern aisles, while the sombre keep-like mass of the  chapter-house adds a romantic element to the effect of the whole  composition, which culminates gracefully in the lofty spire. The  pervading characteristic is simplicity, and the effect solemnising. Sir  Walter Scott, with his usual quick perception of _character_ in  buildings, as well as in man, puts an admirable reference to these  salient points into the mouth of Andrew Fairservice, who exclaims, 'Ah!  it's a brave kirk; nane o' yer whigmaleeries an' curliwurlies, an'  open-steek hems about it.' It may, indeed, be called severe, but not  tame.\"[92] Internally the cathedral has a nave of eight bays, with side  aisles; transepts, not projecting beyond the aisles; a choir of five  bays, with side aisles and an aisle at the east end, with chapels beyond  it. At the north-east corner of the choir is the sacristy or vestiarium;  below it is the chapter-house, with an entrance from the lower church;  on the south side of the church, as a continuation of the transept, is  another low church or crypt, called \"Blacader's Aisle\"; on the north  side are the foundations of a large chapel. Over the crossing rise the  tower and spire, 217 feet high. The church within is 283 feet long by 61  feet broad.[93]    The history of the cathedral is closely connected with many of the  stirring events in Scottish history. King Edward prostrated himself  before its altar; Robert the Bruce within it received absolution, \"while  the Red Cumyn's blood was scarce yet dry upon his dagger\"; and within  its walls was held the Glasgow Assembly of 1638, when the Episcopate was  abolished, and the Presbyterian government was restored. Robert Leighton  has preached within its choir, in his low, sweet voice, and with those  angelic strains of eloquence and devotion which lingered in the memory  of his hearers to their dying day.      3. DIOCESE OF DUNKELD    Dunkeld is situated amid lovely scenery, and was from the earliest times  a religious centre. The name means fort of the Culdees. After the  destruction of Iona by the Norsemen in the beginning of the ninth  century, Dunkeld became the seat of the Columban authority in Scotland,  and part of the relics of St. Columba were brought here by King Kenneth  Macalpine in 850. Its abbot was named Bishop of Fortreum, but in 865 the  primacy was transferred to Abernethy, and thence to St. Andrews in 908.  One of the lay abbots at Dunkeld married a daughter of Malcolm II., and  through the influence of their descendants the religious order in  Scotland was changed. Emerging as great secular chiefs, these lay abbots  weakened, if they did not destroy, the ecclesiastical foundation. The  bishopric was revived by Alexander I. in 1107, and prior to the  thirteenth century was not confined to Atholl, but extended to the  western sea, and included the districts stretching along its shores from  the Firth of Clyde to Lochbroom, and forming the province of Argyll.[94]  The western part was separated about 1200, and formed into a new  bishopric, termed first that of Argyll, and afterward that of  Lismore.[95] Cormac, the Culdee abbot, was the first bishop under the  new order, and among his successors may be mentioned Bishop Sinclair  (1312-1338), the friend of Bruce, and a \"man of courage, the champion of  the Church, and the brave defender of the constitution of the  kingdom\";[96] Bishop Lauder (1452-1476), who filled the see \"with  unfading honour,\"[97] and built a bridge across the Tay, as well as  adorned the cathedral; George Brown (1485-1514), who divided the see  into four deaneries, procured Gaelic preachers,[98] promoted clerical  efficiency, enlarged the palace at Dunkeld, and built the castle of  Cluny;[99] Gavin Douglas (1516-1522), \"a noble, learned, worthy  bishop,\"[100] who translated the _AEneid_ into Scots verse, and thus                    in a barbarous age,      Gave to rude Scotland Virgil's page.    The diocese had four deaneries: (1) Atholl and Drumalbane, with 47  parishes; (2) Angus, with 5; (3) Fife, Fotherick, and Stratherne, with  7; (4) South Forth, with 7.[101]    Canon Myln's quaint _Lives of the Bishops of Dunkeld_ professes to give  an account of the building of the cathedral, and it appears that the  existing structure is chiefly of the fifteenth century.[102] It consists  of an aisleless choir, a nave with two aisles, a north-west tower, and a  chapter-house to the north of the choir. It appears that the different  parts of the structure were begun at the dates given by Abbot Myln, but  were not completed until some time afterwards.[103] All are Third  Pointed in style except the choir, which retains some scanty portions of  First Pointed work. The following are given as the approximate dates of  the original construction: choir (1318-1400); nave (1406-1465);  chapter-house (1457-1465); tower (1469-1501).    The episcopal palace was a little south-west of the cathedral, which  contained many valuable ornaments and vessels, a painted reredos, and in  its great tower two large bells, named St. George and St. Colm  (Columba). At the Reformation in 1560, the cathedral suffered the common  fate of most of such structures, although Argyll and Ruthven, in  requiring the lairds of Airntully and Kinvaid \"to purge the kirk of all  kinds of monuments of idolatry,\" requested them also \"to tak good heid  that neither the desks, windocks, nor doors be onyways hurt or broken,  either glassin work or iron work.\" The closing injunction was not  observed, and the roofs were also demolished. In 1600 the choir was  re-roofed, and is the present parish church. But the ruins still speak  of the former grandeur of this old church-town, and perhaps a like day  may yet dawn for Dunkeld, as has been seen at Dunblane.      4. DIOCESE OF ABERDEEN    The earliest ecclesiastical history of Aberdeen is connected with St.  Machar (a disciple of St. Columba), who preached the Gospel among the  Northern Picts and settled on the banks of the Don, founding there both  a Christian colony and a church, which, from its situation, was called  the Church of Aberdon.

Of course, although in the same city, he was  never again permitted to see wife or children.  He was very dangerous at  first, attacking and nearly killing his guards whenever he got a chance,  and frequently attempting to take his own life, so that they were  obliged to make him work constantly in heavy irons, and, I need scarcely  add, bastinadoed and tortured him until his body became a mass of  bruises from head to foot.  They subdued him, in the course of years, to  a condition of callous and brutal indifference to everything, and at  last his great strength began to give way.  He is now considered  incapable of doing much injury to any one, and seems almost tamed.  The  Turks think that this has been brought about by sickness and starvation;  it may be partly so, but I cannot help thinking that, despite the  contempt which, in a sudden burst of passion, he poured on it just now,  religion has something to do with it, for I have noticed a considerable  change in him since he began to listen to the voice of an old man who  has been a true friend of the poor slaves since long before I came here.  The old man professes, at least he teaches, your religion; but I know  not to what sect he belongs.  Indeed, I think he belongs to none.  This,  however, am I sure of, that he holds equally by our Scriptures and your  Testament as being the whole Word of God.\"    The three captives listened to this narration with sinking hearts, for  it opened up a glimpse of the terrible and hopeless future that lay  before themselves, so that for some time they sat gazing in silence at  their visitor, and at the miserable beings who were devouring the last  crumbs of their black bread around them.    \"I came to see you,\" continued Bacri, \"partly to assure you of the  comparative safety of the girls who interested us all so much on board  the vessel of Sidi Hassan, and partly to say that I will do what lies in  my power to alleviate your sad condition.  With Lucien's education and  knowledge of languages, it may be possible to get him into the immediate  service of the Dey, in which case he will be able to aid his father and  brother.\"    \"Have you, then, much influence with the Dey?\" asked Francisco.    \"None,\" replied the Jew, with a sad smile.  \"I have already told you  that the pirates detest us; that we are tolerated only because of our  money-making powers, and the ease with which they can bleed us when they  want gold.  But I have some influence with others in the city who have  power to move the Dey.  There is one thing, however,\" here the Jew  glanced pointedly at Mariano, \"in regard to which I would give you most  earnest counsel, namely, that you should at once dismiss all idea of  rebellion.  It will be utterly unavailing.  You may, like the caged  lion, if you will, dash yourselves to death against your prison bars,  but you cannot break them.  Countless thousands of bold and brave  spirits have attempted this plan, with no good result, in time past.  The Turks are well acquainted with and quite prepared for it.  Your only  chance of mitigating the woes of your condition lies in submission.\"    \"It were better and nobler to die than to submit,\" said Mariano  gloomily.    \"It were better and nobler to bow to the will of the Almighty than to  commit suicide,\" retorted Bacri, somewhat sternly.  \"It is selfishness  and pride which induces us to seek deliverance from sorrow and suffering  in death.  There are men who have thought that truest nobility lay in  choosing a life in the midst of suffering and woe for the purpose of  alleviating it, and who have acted on their opinion.  This lesson,  however, is not so frequently learnt by us through precept as in the  school of sorrow.\"    Mariano felt abashed, yet at the same time rather nettled.    \"Truly, then,\" he said, with a glance at his blood-stained shirt, \"it  seems to me that I have at all events begun my lesson in the right  school.  However, I believe thou art right, Bacri, and I bear thee no  ill-will for the rap thou didst bestow on my skull, which, luckily, is a  thick one, else thy ponderous fist had split it from the cranium to the  chin.\"    \"We had misjudged you, Bacri,\" said Francisco, extending his hand, as  the Jew rose to depart.    \"We will lay your advice to heart; and we thank you, meanwhile, for  coming to see us in this foul den, which I dislike less because of  moisture and dirt--these being familiar to me--than because of the  lively reptiles which hold their nightly revels in it.\"    There was mingled humour and bitterness in Francisco's tone, as he  uttered this sentence, which he concluded with a heavy sigh.  Immediately after, the rusty bolts of their prison-door grated harshly  on their ears, and they listened sadly to the retreating footsteps of  one whom they now esteemed their only friend, as they died away in the  distance.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    SOME NEW CHARACTERS WALK, GLIDE, AND FURIOUSLY GALLOP INTO THE TALE, AND  OTHERWISE INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO NOTICE.    In the interior court of a beautiful Moorish villa not far from the  city, sat Mrs Langley, wife of Colonel Langley, British consul at the  \"Court\" of Algiers.    The lady of whom we write was unusually romantic, for her romance  consisted of a deep undercurrent of powerful but quiet enthusiasm, with  a pretty strong surface-flow of common-sense.  Her husband was a man of  noble mind and commanding presence--a magnificent representative John  Bull, with the polish of a courtier and the principles of a Christian;  one who had been wisely chosen to fill a very disagreeable post, full of  responsibility and danger.    On a stool at the feet of Mrs Langley sat a sunny second edition of  herself, about eight years of age, named Agnes.  In the cradle which  Agnes had formerly occupied reposed a remarkably plump and dimpled  representative of the Colonel.  When respectfully addressed he was  called Jim, but he was more familiarly known as Baby.    A small negress from beyond the Zahara, and blacker than any coal,  rocked Jim violently.  For this--not the rocking, but the violence--she  had been unavailingly rebuked by Mrs Langley, until that lady's heart  had nearly lost all hope.    \"There--you have done it again, Zubby,\" said Mrs Langley, referring to  a push that well-nigh rolled Master Jim, (as a sea-captain once said),  out at the starboard side of the cradle.    Zubby confessed her guilt, by looking abashed--and what a solemn look an  abashed one is in a negress with very large eyes!--as well as by rocking  more gently.    Agnes vented a sudden little laugh at the expression of Zubby's face;  and, the door opening at that moment, Colonel Langley entered the court,  and sat down beside his wife under the giant leaves of a small  banana-tree, whose life was drawn from a boxful of earth about three  feet square.    \"My dear,\" said the Colonel, \"I have two rather amusing things to lay  before you this evening.  One is a gift from the Dey, the other is a  letter.  Which will you have first?\"    \"The gift, of course,\" replied the lady.    \"Let her come in, Ali,\" called the Colonel to his interpreter, who stood  in the passage outside.    Rais Ali, a Moor clad in the usual Turkish garb, but with a red fez or  skull-cap on his head instead of a turban, threw open the door leading  out of the court, and ushered in poor Paulina Ruffini with her child.    \"Is _this_ the Dey's gift?\" asked the astonished lady, rising hurriedly.    \"It is; at least she is lent to us, and we are bound to accept her.--  Address her in French, my dear; she does not understand English.  In  fact, you'd better take her to your own room and have a talk.\"    Mrs Langley addressed to the poor captive a few reassuring words, and  led her away, leaving the Colonel to amuse himself with Agnes.    \"What has she been sent to us for?\" asked Agnes.    \"To be a serv--a companion to you and baby, my pet.\"    \"That was kind of the Dey, wasn't it?\" said the child.    \"Well--ye-es; oh yes, doubtless, it was very kind of him,\" replied the  Colonel.    We fear that the Colonel did not fully appreciate the kindness that  resulted in the gift either of Paulina Ruffini as his servant, or of  Sidi Hassan as his attendant, for he saw clearly that the former was  unaccustomed to menial work, and he knew that Sidi Hassan was a  turbulent member of the community.  However, being a man of prompt  action, and knowing that it was of the utmost importance that he should  stand well in the good graces of the Dey, he resolved to receive Paulina  into his establishment as governess of the nursery and companion to his  wife, and to leave Sidi Hassan very much to the freedom of his own will,  so long as that will did not interfere with the interests of the  consulate.    On the return of his wife he listened to her pathetic account of  Paulina's sad history, and then produced the letter to which he had  referred on first entering.    \"This letter necessitates my riding into town immediately.  It is a  curious document in its way, therefore lend me your ear.\"    Opening it he began to read.  We give it _verbatim et literatim_:--      \"_To the brittish Cownsul algeers_.      \"7 _teenth Jully_, 18--      \"Sur i'm an irishman an a sailer an recked on the cost of boogia wid    six of me messmaits hoo are wel an arty tho too was drowndid on landin    an wan wos spiflikated be the moors which are born divls an no    mistaik.
