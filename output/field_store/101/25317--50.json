His books passed to his son-in-law, Lord Lumley, at whose  decease they were purchased by Henry, Prince of Wales, and are now in  the British Museum. The Earl of Arundel's books are handsomely bound,  and are known by his badge of the white horse and oak branch which  generally occurs on the covers.    [Illustration: _Earl of Arundel's Badge._]    In Jeremy Collier's 'Ecclesiastical History' (vol. ii. 307) we get a  glimpse of book-matters in London in the middle of the sixteenth  century. At the end of February, 1550, we learn that the Council book  mentions the King's sending a letter for the purging of the library at  Westminster. The persons are not named, but the business was to cull out  all superstitious books, as missals, legends, and such-like, and to  deliver the garniture of the books, either gold or silver, to Sir  Anthony Archer. These books were many of them plated with gold and  silver and curiously embossed. This, as far as we can collect, was the  superstition that destroyed them. 'Here avarice had a very thin  disguise, and the courtiers discovered of what spirit they were to a  remarkable degree.' Here is another picture of an almost contemporaneous  event, equally vivid in its suggestiveness: 'John Tyndale, the  translator's brother, and Thomas Patmore, merchants, were condemned to  do penance by riding with their faces to their horses' tails, with their  books fastened thick about them, pinned, or tacked, to their gowns or  clokes, to the Standard in Cheap; and there with their own hands to  fling them into the fire, kindled on purpose to burn them.'    As a book-collecting period the sixteenth century, from the accession of  Henry VIII.--when books became the organs of the passions of mankind--to  the death of Elizabeth, is full of intense interest. The old order had  changed; the world itself had made an entirely fresh start. Men and  events of the previous two or three centuries were almost as antique  then as they are to-day, and perhaps in many respects they were  infinitely less clearly understood. As the century grew in age, so the  number of book-collectors increased. The hobby became first a passion  with the few, and then the fashion with the many. Henry VIII. was  perhaps a passive rather than an active collector, with a distinct  leaning in favour of beautiful books. His three children, who followed  him on the throne of England, were collectors of books, and the majority  of their purchases must have been made in London. Many of these books  have, at some time or other, drifted from private hands into the  sale-rooms, but perhaps the majority of those now existing are to be  found within the walls of our public institutions. For example, at the  sale of Dr. Askew's MSS., in 1775, a very interesting item was purchased  by a Mr. Jackson, a Quaker, and a dealer in wine and spirits, with whom  book-collecting was a passion. The MS. proved to be in the handwriting  of Edward VI.; it was in French, and dealt with his opinion of his right  to the title of Supreme Head of the Church. At Jackson's sale the MS.  became the property of the British Museum. As another illustration, we  may refer to the copy of the 'Flores Historiarum per Matthaeum  Westmonasteriensem,' etc., 1570, in the British Museum (Cracherode  Collection) which is the identical one presented by Archbishop Parker  (by whose authority it was published) to Queen Elizabeth. It afterwards  fell into the hands of Francis, Earl of Bedford, who bequeathed it, with  the furniture of a little study, to his secretary. It was subsequently  in the possession of Ritson. And yet again, in the Eton College Library,  there is a copy of the 'Missale Romanum,' printed at Paris by Hardouyn,  1530, which belonged to Mary, with a sentence in her handwriting; this  volume afterwards came into the possession of Mary of Este, Queen of  James II., and subsequently into the hands of a London bookseller, from  whom it was purchased for fifty-three shillings by Bishop Fleetwood, and  presented to the college library. Indeed, a large volume might be  compiled on the Adventures of Some Famous Books.    Interesting and important as is the phase of book-collecting which  relates to royal personages, it falls into insignificance beside that of  men who have achieved greatness through their own abilities. The books  collected by Thomas Cranmer, for example, quite overshadow in interest  anything which the whole reign of the Tudors could produce. It has been  well said that his knowledge of books was wide, and his opportunities  for acquiring them unrivalled. Cranmer was a generous collector, for his  library was quite open for the use of learned men. Latimer spent 'many  an hour' there, and has himself told us that he met with a copy of  Dionysius 'in my Lord of Canterbury's library.' We have already seen  that many of Cranmer's books passed into the possession of the Earl of  Arundel, but many were 'conveyed and stolen awaie.' Cranmer's books have  found an enthusiastic historian in Prebendary Burbidge, who has almost  rehabilitated the great ecclesiastic's library in the first part of Mr.  Quaritch's 'Dictionary of English Book-collectors.' Another  book-collector of a very different type was amassing an extensive  library at a somewhat later period than Cranmer: Dr. Dee, the famous  necromancer, had collected '4,000 volumes, printed and unprinted, bound  and unbound, valued at 2,000 lib.,' of which one Greek, two French and  one High Dutch volumes of MSS. alone were 'worth 533 lib.' It occupied  forty years to form this library. Most of his books passed into the  possession of Elias Ashmole--who was another collector with an  insatiable appetite--and now form a part of the Ashmolean Museum. Some  of Dee's singular MSS. were found, long after his death, in the secret  drawer of a chest, which had passed through many hands undiscovered.  Reverting for a moment to Ashmole, he himself tells us that he gave  'five volumes of Mr. Dugdale's' works to the Temple Library. And  further: 'My first boatful of books, which were carried to Mrs.  Tradescant's, were brought back to the Temple.' In May, 1667, he bought  Mr. John Booker's study of books, and gave L140 for them. In 1681 he  bought 'Mr. Lilly's library of books of his widow, for L50.'    A very distinguished book-collector of the Elizabethan period was Sir  Francis Drake, the great Admiral. It did not seem to be at all known  that the distinguished naval hero was also a bibliophile until 1883,  when the collection of books was brought from the old residence of the  Drakes, Nutwell Court, Lympstone, Devon, to Sotheby's. The sale  comprised 1,660 lots, representing several thousand volumes, the total  being L3,276 17s. 6d. It was especially rich in books and old tracts of  the early seventeenth century relating to the English voyages to  America, and some of these realized very high figures. Although the  library was undoubtedly founded by Drake, it was evidently continued by  his descendants. Bacon, Baron of Verulam, was a distinguished  book-collector, as the shelves of his chambers in Gray's Inn would have  testified. Archbishop Parker, than whom 'a more determined book-fancier  never existed in Great Britain,' and Gabriel Harvey, the friend of  Spenser, and the object of Tom Nash's withering scorn, were among the  most inveterate book-collectors of Elizabethan London. Had Harvey--whose  books usually contain his autograph on the title-page, and not a few of  which were given him by Spenser--studied his books less, and the proper  study of mankind a little more, he might have shown his talents off to a  better advantage than in his conflicts with Nash. In the Bodleian there  is a set of old tales and romances which Spenser lent Harvey, taking as  a hostage, apparently, Harvey's copy of Lucian in four volumes. Harvey  had a very poor opinion of such 'foolish' books, but he does not seem to  have returned them to their rightful owner. The fire which destroyed Ben  Jonson's MSS. undoubtedly consumed many of his printed books, but  examples from his library, with 'Sum Ben Jonson' inscribed, are  sometimes met with. Shakespeare may have had a library, but we have no  evidence that he possessed even a copy of his own plays in quarto. The  Elizabethan poets and dramatists were prodigious contributors to the  press, but very poor patrons of booksellers. From various sources we get  some highly-coloured and unflattering pictures of the typical  booksellers of the period. Tom Nash has limned for us a vivid little  portrait in 'Pierce Penilesse' (1592), in which he declares that if he  were to paint Sloth, 'I swear that I would draw it like a stationer that  I know, with his thumb under his girdle, who, if ever a man come to his  stall to ask him for a book, never stirs his head, or looks upon him,  but stands stone still, and speaks not a word, only with his little  finger points backward to his boy, who must be his interpreter; and so  all day, gaping like a dumb image, he sits without motion, except at  such times as he goes to dinner or supper, for then he is as quick as  other three, eating six times every day.'      II.    From start to finish the Stuart dynasty ruled England for close on  three-quarters of a century. That book-collecting should have existed at  all under it is a marvel. But the hobby no longer depended upon the  patronage of courts and courtiers. From the Wise Fool, James I., to the  Foolish Fool, the second James, collectors pursued their hobby in London  and out of it. James I. began to collect books at a very early age, and  a list of his library was published for the first time in the _Athenaeum_  in 1893. It has, however, but little interest to us in this place, for  doubtless most of the books were imported into Scotland "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#9)"],[1,"old editions of books of English  history and controversial theology.    The most famous second-hand book-shop in Boston was Burnham's, whose  fore-name was Thomas Oliver Hazard Perry, shortened into \"Perry Burnham\"  by his familiars. He was a little, pale-faced, wiry, nervous man, with  piercing black eyes and very brusque manners. In old and musty books he  lived and moved and had his being, for more than a generation. He  exchanged a stuffy, narrow shop in Cornhill for more spacious quarters in  Washington street, near School street, where he bought and sold books  with an assiduous devotion to business, never trusting to others what he  could do himself. He was proud of his collection and its extent. He  bought books and pamphlets at auction literally by the cart-load, every  thing that nobody else wanted being bid off to Burnham at an  insignificant price, almost nominal. He got a wide reputation for  selling cheaply, but he always knew when to charge a stiff price for a  book, and to stick to it. Once when I was pricing a lot of miscellaneous  books picked out for purchase, mostly under a dollar a volume, we came to  a copy of \"The Constitutions of the Several Independent States of  America,\" 1st edition, Philadelphia, 1781, of which two hundred copies  only were printed, by order of Congress. This copy was in the original  boards, uncut, and with the autograph of Timothy Pickering on the title  page. \"If the Congress Library wants that book,\" said Mr. Burnham, \"it  will have to pay eight dollars for it.\" I took it, well pleased to secure  what years of search had failed to bring. The next year my satisfaction  was enhanced when an inferior copy of the same book was offered at twenty  dollars.    Burnham died a wealthy man, having amassed a million dollars in trade and  by rise in real estate, as he owned the land on which the Parker House  stands in Boston.    Among Philadelphia dealers in second-hand books, one John Penington was  recognized as most intelligent and honorable. He was a book-lover and a  scholar, and one instinctively ranked him not as a bookseller, but as a  gentleman who dealt in books. On his shelves one always found books of  science and volumes in foreign languages.    Another notable dealer was John Campbell, a jolly, hearty Irish-American,  with a taste for good books, and an antipathy to negroes, as keen as the  proverbial hatred of the devil for holy water. Campbell wrote a book  entitled \"Negromania,\" published in 1851, in which his creed was set  forth in strong language. He was a regular bidder at book auctions, where  his burly form and loud voice made him a prominent figure.    Of notable auction sales of books, and of the extravagant prices obtained  for certain editions by ambitious and eager competition, there is little  room to treat. The oft-told story of the Valdarfer Boccaccio of 1471,  carried off at the Roxburghe sale in 1812, at L2,260 from Earl Spencer by  the Marquis of Blandford, and re-purchased seven years after at another  auction for L918, has been far surpassed in modern bibliomania. \"The  sound of that hammer,\" wrote the melodramatic Dibdin, \"echoed through  Europe:\" but what would he have said of the Mazarin Bible of Gutenberg  and Fust (1450-55) sold in 1897, at the Ashburnham sale, for four  thousand pounds, or of the Latin Psalter of Fust and Schoeffer, 2d ed.  1459, which brought L4,950 at the Syston Park sale in 1884? This last sum  (about twenty-four thousand dollars) is the largest price ever yet  recorded as received for a single volume. Among books of less rarity,  though always eagerly sought, is the first folio Shakespeare of 1623, a  very fine and perfect copy of which brought L716.2 at Daniel's sale in  1864. Copies warranted perfect have since been sold in London for L415 to  L470. In New York, a perfect but not \"tall\" copy brought $4,200 in 1891  at auction. Walton's \"Compleat Angler,\" London, 1st ed. 1653, a little  book of only 250 pages, sold for L310 in 1891. It was published for one  shilling and sixpence. The first edition of Robinson Crusoe brought L75  at the Crampton sale in 1896.    The rage for first editions of very modern books reached what might be  called high-water mark some time since, and has been on the decline.  Shelley's \"Queen Mab,\" 1st ed. 1813, was sold at London for L22.10, and  his \"Refutation of Deism,\" 1814, was sold at L33, at a London sale in  1887. In New York, many first editions of Shelley's poems brought the  following enormous prices in 1897.        Shelley's Adonais, 1st ed. Pisa, Italy, 1821, $335.      Alastor, London, 1816, $130.      The Cenci, Italy, 1819, $65.      Hellas, London, 1822, $13.    But these were purely adventitious prices, as was clearly shown in the  sale at the same auction rooms, a year or two earlier, of the following:        Shelley's Adonais, 1st ed. Pisa, 1821, $19.      Alastor, London, 1816, $32.      The Cenci, Italy, 1819, $21.      Hellas, London, 1822, $2.    The sales occasionally made at auction of certain books at extraordinary  prices, prove nothing whatever as to the real market value, for these  reasons: (1) The auctioneer often has an unlimited bid, and the price is  carried up to an inordinate height. (2) Two or more bidders present,  infatuated by the idea of extreme rarity, bid against one another until  all but one succumb, when the price has reached a figure which it is a  mild use of terms to call absurd. (3) Descriptions in sale catalogues,  though often entirely unfounded, characterising a book as \"excessively  rare;\" \"only -- copies known,\" \"very scarce,\" \"never before offered at  our sales,\" etc., may carry the bidding on a book up to an unheard-of  price.    The appeal always lies to the years against the hours; and many a poor  book-mad enthusiast has had to rue his too easy credulity in giving an  extravagant sum for books which he discovers later that he could have  bought for as many shillings as he has paid dollars. Not that the  _rarissimi_ of early printed books can ever be purchased for a trifle;  but it should ever be remembered that even at the sales where a few--a  very few--bring the enormous prices that are bruited abroad, the mass of  the books offered are knocked down at very moderate figures, or are even  sacrificed at rates very far below their cost. The possessor of one of  the books so advertised as sold at some auction for a hundred dollars or  upwards, if he expects to realise a tithe of the figure quoted, will  speedily find himself in the vocative.    While there are almost priceless rarities not to be found in the market  by any buyer, let the book collector be consoled by the knowledge that  good books, in good editions, were never so easy to come by as now. A  fine library can be gathered by any one with very moderate means,  supplemented by a fair amount of sagacity and common sense. The buyer  with a carefully digested list of books wanted will find that to buy them  wisely takes more time and less money than he had anticipated. The time  is required to acquaint himself with the many competing editions, with  their respective merits and demerits. This involves a comparison of type,  paper, and binding, as well as the comparative prices of various dealers  for the same books. No one who is himself gifted with good perceptions  and good taste, should trust to other hands the selection of his library.  His enjoyment of it will be proportioned to the extent to which it is his  own creation. The passion for nobly written books, handsomely printed,  and clothed in a fitting garb, when it has once dawned, is not to be  defrauded of its satisfaction by hiring a commission merchant to appease  it. What we do for ourselves, in the acquirement of any knowledge, is apt  to be well done: what is done for us by others is of little value.    We have heard of some uninformed _parvenus_, grown suddenly rich, who  have first ordered a magnificent library room fitted with rose-wood,  marble and gilded trappings, and then ordered it to be filled with  splendidly bound volumes at so much per volume. And it is an authentic  fact, that a bookseller to the Czar of Russia one Klostermann, actually  sold books at fifty to one hundred roubles by the yard, according to the  binding. The force of folly could no farther go, to debase the aims and  degrade the intellect of man.    In the chapter upon rare books, the reader will find instances in great  variety of the causes that contribute to the scarcity and enhancement of  prices of certain books, without at all affecting their intrinsic value,  which may be of the smallest.          CHAPTER 3.    THE ART OF BOOK BINDING.      In these suggestions upon the important question of the binding of books,  I shall have nothing to say of the history of the art, and very little of  its aesthetics. The plainest and most practical hints will be aimed at,  and if my experience shall prove of value to any, I shall be well  rewarded for giving it here. For other matters readers will naturally  consult some of the numerous manuals of book-binding in English, French  and German. The sumptuous bindings executed in the sixteenth century,  under the patronage and the eyes of Grolier, the famous tooled  masterpieces of Derome, Le Gascon, Padeloup, Trautz and other French  artists, and the beautiful gems of the binder's art from the hands of  Roger Payne, Lewis, Mackenzie, Hayday and Bedford, are they not  celebrated in the pages of Dibdin, Lacroix, Fournier, Wheatley, and  Robert Hoe?    There are some professed lovers of books who affect either indifference  or contempt for the style in which their favorites are dressed. A well  known epigram of Burns is sometimes quoted against the fondness for fine  bindings which widely prevails in the present day, as it did in that of  the Scottish Poet. A certain Scottish nobleman, endowed with more wealth  than brains, was vain of his splendidly bound Shakespeare, which,"]]]
