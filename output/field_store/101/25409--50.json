Inasmuch as the coal went on  a down grade from the mines to the markets, it could be carried more  economically by railway than by canal.    Of far greater importance are the St. Marys Canal on the Canadian side,  and the St. Marys Falls Canal on the American side, of St. Marys River.  These canals obviate the falls in St. Marys River and form the  commercial outlet of Lake Superior. The tonnage of goods, mainly iron  ore and coal, is about one-half greater than that of the Suez Canal.  About twenty-five thousand vessels pass through these canals yearly.    The Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal,[10] from Lake Michigan to Lockport,  on the Illinois River, was designed mainly to carry the sewage of  Chicago which, prior to the construction of the canal, was poured into  the lake through the Chicago River. The completion of the canal turned  the course of the river and caused the water to flow out of the lake,  carrying the city's sewage. It is intended to complete a navigable  water-way from Chicago to St. Louis deep enough for vessels drawing  fourteen feet. Its value is therefore strategic as well as industrial,  for by means of it gun-boats may readily pass from the Gulf of Mexico to  the Great Lakes.    Oceanic canals are designed both for naval strategic purposes and for  industrial uses. Thus, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, from the mouth of the  Elbe to Kiel Bay, across the base of Jutland, saves two days between  Hamburg and the Baltic ports. It also enables German war-vessels to  concentrate quickly in either the North or the Baltic Sea. The  Manchester Ship Canal makes Manchester a seaport and saves the cost of  trans-shipping freights by rail from Liverpool. The Corinth Canal across  the isthmus that joins the Peloponnesus to the mainland of Greece  affords a much shorter route between Italian ports and Odessa. The North  Holland Ship Canal makes Amsterdam practically a seaport.    Probably no other highway of commerce since the discovery of the Cape  route around Africa has caused such a great change and readjustment of  trade between Europe and Asia as the Suez Canal. Sailing-vessels still  take the Cape route, because the heavy towage tolls through the canal  more than offset the gain in time. Steamships have their own power and  generally take the canal route, thereby saving about ten days in time  and fuel, and about four thousand eight hundred miles in distance. In  spite of the heavy tolls the saving is considerable. About three  thousand five hundred vessels pass through the canal yearly.    The Suez Canal, constructed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, for some time was  under the control of French capitalists. Subsequently, by the purchase  of stock partly in open market and partly from the Khedive of Egypt, the  control of the canal passed into the hands of the English. The  restrictions placed upon the passage of war-ships is such that the canal  would be of little use to nations at war.    [Illustration: THE ROUTE OF THE PANAMA CANAL]    The necessity of an interoceanic canal across the American continent has  become more imperative year by year for fifty years. The discovery of  gold in California caused an emigration from the Atlantic to the Pacific  coast which resulted in a permanent settlement of the latter region. A  railway across the Isthmus of Panama and another across the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec have afforded very poor means of communication between  oceans.    In 1881 work on a tide-level canal across the Isthmus of Panama was  begun, but the plan was afterward changed to a high-level canal. The  change was thought necessary partly on account of the great cost of the  former, and partly because of the difficulties of constructing so deep a  cut--about three hundred and forty feet--at the summit of the Culebra  ridge. The construction company, after spending the entire  capital--about one hundred and twenty million dollars--in accomplishing  one-tenth of the work, became bankrupt. The United States subsequently  purchased the franchise.    A canal by way of Lake Nicaragua has also been projected, and two  treaties with Great Britain, whereby the United States agreed to build  no fortifications to guard it, have been made. No work beyond the  surveys has yet been undertaken, however. The cost of each canal is  estimated between one hundred and fifty million and two hundred million  dollars. The Panama route will require about twelve hours for the  passage of a vessel; the Nicaragua route about sixty hours.[11] (_See  map, p. 270._)    The completion of a canal by either route will cause a readjustment of  the world's commerce far greater than that which followed the  construction of the Suez Canal. By such a route San Francisco is brought  nearer to London than Calcutta now is, and the all-water route between  the Atlantic ports of the United States and those of China and Japan  will be shortened by upward of eight thousand miles. The importance of  the Hawaiian Islands, already a great ocean depot, will be greatly  increased, and the latter is becoming one of the great commercial  stations of the world.      QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION    What were some of the effects which resulted from the various embargo  and non-intercourse acts that preceded the war of 1812?    What is the effect upon an industry when all means of getting the  products to market are cut off?    In the early history of the country rivers were the most important  highways of commerce; obtain an account of some instance of this in  detail.    Certain commodities have been carried about four-fifths of the distance  between Moscow and Vladivostok by water, across Siberia. Illustrate  this, using the map of the Russian Empire, plate, p. 342.    What has been the effect of cheap steel on ocean navigation?    Discuss the difference between a screw-steamship and a side-wheeler; a  ship and a schooner. How are vessels steered?    How does a triple-expansion engine differ from an ordinary steam-engine?    Cargoes are carried by water across Europe from Havre to Marseilles, and  from The Hague to the mouth of the Danube; illustrate the route on a map  of Europe.    The following instruction occasionally is found in the pilothouse of a  vessel--what is its meaning?        \"Green to green and red to red--      Perfect safety; go ahead.\"    From the chart on p. 49 show how a pilot uses the range lights in  entering New York Harbor.    The new freighter Minnesota is designed to carry a load of 30,000 tons;  how many trains of fifty cars, each car holding 30,000 pounds, are  required to furnish her cargo?

[Illustration: A MODERN LOCOMOTIVE--THE TWENTIETH CENTURY LIMITED AT A  SPEED EXCEEDING NINETY MILES AN HOUR]          CHAPTER VI    TRANSPORTATION--RAILWAYS AND RAILWAY ORGANIZATION; PUBLIC HIGHWAYS      In the United States and western Europe, in spite of the low cost of  water transportation, the railways have almost wholly monopolized the  transportation of commodities. This is due in part to the saving of time  in transit--for under the demands of modern business, the only economy  is economy of time--and in part to prompt delivery at the specified  time.    Into a large centre of population like New York, London, or Berlin, many  millions of pounds of perishable food-stuffs must be brought daily for  consumption. Now these food-stuffs must be delivered with promptness,  and no delay can be tolerated. A shipper having half a million pounds of  meat or a hundred thousand pounds of flour or a car-load of fruit to  deliver can take no risks; he sends it by rail, not only because it is  the quickest way, but because experience has shown it to be the most  prompt way; as a rule, it is delivered on the exact minute of schedule  time.    Cargoes of silks and teas from China and Japan might be sent all the way  to London by water, but experience has shown a more profitable way. The  consignments are sent by swift steamships to Seattle; thence by fast  express trains to New York; there they are transferred to swift liners  that take them across the Atlantic to European ports. And although this  method of shipment is enormously expensive as compared with the  all-water route, the saving of time and certainty of prompt delivery  more than offset the extra cost of delivery.    In the last half of the nineteenth century the cost of haulage in the  United States by rail decreased so materially that in a few instances  only--notably the Great Lakes and the Hudson River--do inland waters  compete with the railways.[12] This is due in part to better  organization of the railways, but mainly to the substitution of Bessemer  steel for iron rails and the great improvements in locomotives and  rolling stock.    The use of a steam-driven locomotive became possible for the first time  when Stephenson used the tubular boiler and the forced draught,[13]  thereby making steam rapidly enough for a short, quick stroke. In 1865 a  good freight locomotive weighing thirty tons could haul about forty  box-cars, each loaded with ten tons. This was the maximum load for a  level track; the average load for a single locomotive was about  twenty-five or thirty cars. Heavier locomotives could not well be used  because the iron rails went to pieces under them.    The invention of Bessemer steel produced a rail that was safe under the  pounding of a locomotive three or four times as heavy as those formerly  employed; it produced boilers that would carry steam at 250 instead of  60 pounds pressure per square inch. As a result, with only a moderate  increase in the fuel burned, a single"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24902"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 4, March, 1851 (#9)"],[1,"artistic  treatment of his subject. His novel is socialistic. Adolph Hahr and  Alfred Meissner are also among the contributors. On the whole the book  is a good one.    Leopold Schefer has published lately in Berlin _The Bishop's Wife, a  Tale of the Papacy_, in which the great Napoleon of the church,  Hildebrand, figures as the hero. The Germans have never succeeded in the  historical novel. With vast resources in materiel, they have always a  vagueness, a want of definite interest, of picturesque arrangement, and  of sustained and disciplined power. Schefer is a scholar, and his  didactic purpose is plain enough, and well enough managed. The Teutonic  character has always instinctively revolted against the practice of  celibacy, a form of ascetism quite natural, and sometimes perhaps  inevitable, as a reaction against the unbridled sensualism of the  Africans and Asiatics, but quite out of place in climes so temperate and  races so moderate, conscientious, and self-respecting as those of  Northern Europe. It needed all the genius and determination of  Hildebrand himself to enforce the celibacy of the German clergy, and  certainly they have never ceased more or less covertly to revolt against  it. It is well understood that, at the present time, there is a very  general wish among the Catholics of Germany--more especially of South  Germany, where they are not jealous of Protestant encroachments--to have  marriage allowed to the parochial clergy; and the clergy themselves are  foremost in this tendency, though it may not accord with their interest  unreservedly to display it. It has, however, betrayed its existence in  various ways, especially in anonymous literary productions, in prose and  verse. So general is this feeling, and so profound the conviction that  something must be done, that in 1848 it was very generally credited that  the Pope was prepared to sanction a relaxation of the laws of the church  in this respect. For this belief, however, there could have been no  just foundation, since Pius IX. is the reputed author of the official  reply, made while he was but a priest, to the Brazilian Archbishop  Feijo, upon this very subject, in which it was alleged that such a  relaxation of discipline would be an abandonment of the \"integrity of  the church.\" Yet without something of the kind, it is thought that a  very extensive schism in catholic Germany will be inevitable.           *       *       *       *       *    _Der Mensch im Spiegel der Natur_ (Man in the Mirror of Nature), is an  excellent little work for popular use, by Mr. E.

The work well deserves a  translation into English.           *       *       *       *       *    A work of extreme interest to geologists is the _Gaea Norwegica_, edited  by Professor KEILHAU of the Christiana University, and published at that  place.

The authoress is well known and  well liked by those readers of German novels who take delight in the  genius of authoresses, and think ladies can write as well as men. Jeanne  Marie has seen much, felt much, and thought almost if not quite as much  as she has seen and felt. Her poetic culture is however still defective,  and her stories are better than her lyrics. The latter lack finish and  correctness, and abound in mere conceits rather than in genuine poetic  images. Where she attempts simply to narrate an event in the ballad  style she is more successful.           *       *       *       *       *    A BOOK of curious historical interest is now in course of publication in  Germany, the first volume of which has already made its appearance.

He was in the habit of noting every thing that passed  around him, or with which he was connected, whether of a political,  military, or personal nature. His field of service extended throughout  the entire empire, and embraced the most important events in the reign  of Peter the Great. He participated in the suppression of the corps of  Strelitzes, made two campaigns against the Turks, was active in Peter's  reorganization of the army, &c., &c. The first volume comes down to  1678; the remainder will soon follow. As the whole was written without  any design of being communicated to the world, it is especially valuable  for its glimpses at the domestic habits of the country at that peculiar  period.           *       *       *       *       *    GEORGE SAND'S NEW DRAMA.--George Sand's _Claudie_ has had a brilliant  fortune at Paris, where it was first performed the second week in  January. It is a drama of peasant life, in three acts, in prose. Jules  Janin says of it: \"The success of Claudie is a true, sincere, and  energetic success. It has impassioned the calmest souls; it has calmed  the most agitated. This poem is a veritable festival, full of the rustic  delights of the country, of the most honorable passions of the human  heart, of the noblest sentiments. Add to this, a charm altogether new, a  charm both inspired and inspiring, in the style, which is reason and  good sense in the most delicious costume. Neither effort nor study is  there, but only that simplicity so much sought for in the most precious  passages of _Daphnis and Chloe_ translated to the Marivaux by Amyot  himself. The piece was listened to with ravishment. There was universal  praise among the audience, an inexpressible abundance of tears, of  laughter, of gayety, of sighs, of words fitly spoken, of eloquent  silence.\" Of the plot we take the following account from an article by  Paul de Musset: From the beginning we feel the air of the country, the  harvest, and the sun of August. Farmer Fauveau is preparing to pay the  harvesters. His employer, Dame Rose, a young and pretty widow, has just  returned from the city, where she had been for a lawsuit. Fauveau, a  shrewd but good-natured man, skilfully calls her attention to the sad  and agitated air of his son, who is no doubt in love with some one, and  with whom can it be except his charming mistress? Dame Rose admits that  Sylvain Fauveau is a handsome fellow, and a good and intelligent  workman, who would manage affairs with discretion, but he would be  jealous of his wife. Jealousy, replies the old man, is a proof of love,  and so Dame Rose begins to cherish the idea that Sylvain is in love with  her. This is not true, but the old man has said it purposely. He  suspects Sylvain of being in love with Claudie, a simple laborer in the  harvest field, without a penny, and gaining her living, with no other  relative than a grandfather of eighty, who may any day become a charge  upon her little earnings. Claudie comes in from work with her  grandfather, and they ask for their pay, the harvest being finished, and  it being six leagues to their home. They are paid, and Sylvain takes  care that they shall receive more than his father intends, and that they  shall be invited to the harvest festival. Claudie aids in the  preparations, and Sylvain, reproaching her tenderly for working after a  day so fatiguing, takes from her the severer part of the duties she has  undertaken. But she only replies in monosyllables, and does not turn her  eyes from the plates and other utensils she is engaged with. Sylvain,  troubled by this, withdraws, murmuring at her coldness and indifference.  We soon see the cause of this. A young peasant appears. It is the  handsome Denis Ronciat, the beau and cajoler of the village girls, who  utters an exclamation of surprise. A brief explanation informs us that  Denis was betrothed to Claudie when she was fifteen, that he"]]]
