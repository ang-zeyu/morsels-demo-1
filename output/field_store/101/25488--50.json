[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],[0,"Music and Some Highly Musical People (#9)"],[1,"\"Musical Festival,\" as it was called, continued three days,  the performance of each part of the triology occupying--exclusive of a  wait of one hour after each act--from four to five hours.    At these performances the nobility of Germany and other countries,  together with the Abbe Liszt, and many others in the higher walks of  music, were present. The audiences were immense, brilliant, and  exceedingly demonstrative in applause. At the close of the opera,  Wagner was called before the curtain, receiving quite an ovation: and  in his speech he said, \"Now we see what can be done: at last we have a  German art.\"    It is perhaps too early, as yet, to decide that Richard Wagner's ideal  will be adopted by the musical world; nor should we be in too much  haste to conclude that it will not be. Certainly he has succeeded, at  least, in dividing the highest critics of the glorious art; and the  history of music shows, as does also that of all art, that what is  rejected to-day may be warmly and even rapturously accepted to-morrow.    Of the festival at Bayreuth, Mr. Hazard, musical critic of \"The  New-York Tribune,\" writes, \"The effect of the music was magnificent  beyond all description. It far surpassed all expectation; and the  general verdict is that it is a triumph of the new school of music,  final and complete.\"    Of the impression created by one of the parts of the opera,  \"Rheingold\" (Mr. F.A. Schwabe), of \"The New-York Times,\" says,  \"Musically considered, it is not significant. It is hopeless,  therefore, to look for popularity for the work; at present, at least.\"    \"The agony is over; and the grandest of all operatic conceptions, the  musical drama over which Richard Wagner toiled and dreamed for twenty  years, has been given to the world in its complete form.\"[10]    [Footnote 10: From a writer in the New-York Herald.]    Very recently, Mr. Moncure D. Conway thus expresses his high  admiration for the work of Wagner:--         \"I am satisfied that the English-speaking world is little       aware at present of the immensity and importance of the work       Wagner has done for art. Plato declared that the true       musician must have poetry and music harmonized in himself;       and the world has waited twenty-five hundred years for that       combination to appear. Having carefully read the poems all       written by himself which Wagner has set to music, or rather       which incarnated themselves in music, and costumed       themselves in scenery as he wrote them, I venture to affirm       that none can so read them without the conviction that their       author is a true poet. In the first place, the general       conception of his chief operas, taken together, is in the       largest sense poetic, and I might even say Homeric. This man       has transmitted an entire religion to poetry, and then set       it to music. And it is one of the greatest of       religions,--what Nature engraved on the heart of our own       Teutonic ancestors. It is all there,--its thousand       phantasmal years, from the first cowering cry of the Norse       savage before the chariot of his storm-god to the last       gentle hymn that rose to Freya under her new name of       Mary,--all. It is interpreted as a purely human expression;       and, I repeat, no man has done so vast and worthy an       artistic work in our time.\"    While America has perhaps produced as yet no _great_ composers, it has  several of very high merit, such as J.K. Paine, Dudley Buck, and  others. In the United States there are many remarkable vocal and  instrumental artists, a large number of classical musical clubs and  societies; while several of its great vocalists, male and female,  accept and decline engagements in Europe. Perhaps no finer orchestra  exists anywhere than that of Theodore Thomas of New York; while nearly  as high praise may be given to the Mendelssohn and Beethoven Quintette  Clubs of Boston, and to others in different parts of the country.    Music is quite generally cultivated in this country; and there are  many excellent critics, musical writers, and periodicals devoted to  this beautiful and elevating science.    A very startling late American musical invention is the \"telephone,\" a  description of the working of which is given below:--         \"MUSIC BY TELEGRAPH.         \"A most interesting field for the musical student is the       progress that is being made in _telegraphing musical       sounds_.         \"This is done by means of the telephone, which transmits       simultaneously several different tones through one wire by       means of steel forks made to vibrate at one end of the line,       the pulsations passing through the wire independently of       each other, and reappearing at the distant station on       vibrating reeds.         \"Some very interesting tests were made in the Centennial       Main Building a few days ago in the presence of about fifty       invited guests, among whom were noticed the Emperor and       Empress of Brazil, Sir William Thompson, and quite a number       of eminent electricians.         \"The experiments were of a very interesting and successful       character.         \"The inventor, Mr. Gray of Chicago, asked his assistant, Mr.       Goodridge, to transmit musical sounds, which were received       very distinctly amid hearty applause from those present.         \"It was the first time that many present had heard 'Home,       Sweet Home,' 'My Country, 'tis of Thee,' or 'Old Hundred,'       rendered so beautifully by telegraph; and they evidently       enjoyed the treat.\"    By this invention, music played upon a piano-forte or melodeon is  reproduced upon a violin attached to the receiving end of the wire at  a distance of twenty-four hundred miles.    Another important musical invention (English) is that of the \"voice  harmonium.\" Of this Mr. Theo. T. Seward writes,--         \"To all such the invention of which I speak is a matter of       deep interest, because in it is practically solved the       problem of perfect intonation. It is called the 'voice       harmonium,' because the securing of perfect intonation       brings the tones much nearer to the quality of the human       voice. The instrument has been invented and patented by Mr.       Colin Brown of Glasgow, Ewing lecturer on music. By the use       of additional reeds and a most ingenious keyboard, he has       succeeded in giving each key in _perfect_ tune. The 'wolf'       is banished altogether, without the privilege of a single       growl. I do not need to say that the effect upon the ear is       rich, and extremely satisfactory. After listening to it a       little while, the tones of a tempered organ sound coarse and       harsh. I wish very much that some of our ingenious American       instrument-makers could have the opportunity of examining       it. It has been publicly exhibited at the South-Kensington       Exhibition, before the recent meeting of the British       Association, and elsewhere. The highest scientific       authorities have pronounced most thoroughly in favor of its       'perfectness, beauty, and simplicity.' Whether the greater       complication of the keyboard will interfere seriously with       its popular use, remains to be seen.\"    Mr. Theodore Thomas recently gave an excellent performance of the  works of American composers. Among those rendered were compositions by  Dudley Buck, A.H. Pease, and William Mason. One of the gems of the  evening was a symphonic poem by William H. Foy, entitled \"A Day in the  Country.\"    Mr. Thomas's orchestra, noted for placing upon its programmes only  works of the highest merit, has recently also presented with much  success a new symphony by the talented composer of oratorios, &c.,  J.K. Paine.    In alluding to the progress of music in the United States, \"The Music  Trade Review\" says, \"If the centennial year could disclose all its  triumphs, music would shine among its garlands. A hundred years ago  was a voiceless void for us compared with the native voices and native  workers who now know a sonnet from a saraband.\"          IV.    THE BEAUTY, POWER, AND USES OF MUSIC.         \"The soul lives its best hours when surrounded by melody,       and is drawn towards its home, Paradise, dreaming of its       hymning seraphs who adore with ecstasies that can find       utterance only in song.\"         \"And how can happiness be better expressed than by song or       music? And, if the body and mind are both attuned to a true       enjoyment of their resources, how much more will the moral       nature be refined and educated!\"      The cultivation of the art of music has ever followed closely the  progress of civilization; and those nations that have attained to the  highest state of the latter have most encouraged the growth, and have  been most skilled in the creation and performance, of music.  Montesquieu avers that \"music is the only one of all the arts that  does not corrupt the mind.\" Confucius said, \"Wouldst thou know if a  people be well governed, if its laws be good or bad? examine the music  it practises.\" Again: another has quite aptly said that         \"Music is one of the greatest educators in the world; and       the study of it in its higher departments, such as       composition, harmony, and counterpoint, develops the mind as       much as the study of mathematics or the languages. It       teaches us love, kindness, charity, perseverance, patience,       diligence, promptness, and punctuality.\"    And a writer in \"Chambers's Journal\" remarks, that         \"In society, where education requires a submission to rule       singing belongs to the domain of art; but, in a primitive       state, all nations have their songs. Musical rhythm drives       away weariness, lessens fatigue, detaches the mind from the       painful realities of life, and braces up the courage to meet       danger.

[Illustration: _The Devil's Jumps, beyond Frensham Pond._]    Frensham Pond still lies open and wild to the sky, though it may not be  long before its shyer visitors leave it for more secluded waters. The  motor omnibuses from Farnham have not yet frightened them all away. Coot  and moorhens paddle in and out of the reeds, and great grebes float  leisurely about its surface. It has always been famous for its fishing.  In Aubrey's time it was \"well known for its carps to the London  fishmongers,\" and to-day it holds pike, perch and tench. I heard of no  carp. Who would eat a carp?    In the bar of the little inn that stands on the edge of Frensham Pond  there is an interesting case holding two blackcocks and a grey-hen,  whose unhappy lot it was to be shot--perhaps the last of their race seen  in this part of Surrey. They were killed nineteen years ago, in 1889.  Actually the last blackcock chronicled in Surrey were a pair seen near  Hindhead, I believe in 1906.    [Illustration: _The Devil's Jumps, from Frensham Common._]    From Frensham Great Pond one may push on to Hindhead, three or four  miles to the south-east, or may return to Farnham through Tilford by way  of the Little Pond, another broad and shining stretch of water. The way  to Farnham is the better, for it means leaving the high road for the  natural paths that run over and round the windy ridges of the commonland  to the east. From the rising ground between the two Frensham ponds there  is a fine panorama of pine and heather. Crooksbury Hill juts up dark and  commanding to the north; the level line of the ridge on the left, a few  hundred yards away, is broken and humped with barrows; far away to the  east lies Charterhouse, grey in the haze by Godalming; behind, to the  south-east, the Devil's Jumps, three little squat, conical hills whose  very oddity is one of their attractions. They edge the horizon like  inverted pudding bowls covered with bracken, and with bell-heather  kindling to crimson in the July sunlight.    [Illustration: _Bridge at Tilford._]    July is the month in which to visit Frensham Little Pond. It was an  accident which first showed me the pond as it ought to be seen, and as  few see it. I had been watching a number of herons through my glasses;  one of them eyeing me discontentedly from the reeds on a southern arm of  the water, and three more flapping majestically over the trees,  apparently dropping suddenly down into the valley of the Wey. Trying to  take a short cut to the stream I missed my way among the woodland rides,  and suddenly found myself again on the edge of the pond. It was worth  making the mistake. The northern corner of the pond by the little  boathouse is one sheet of white waterlilies. The corner runs into a  rough triangle, with two sides fifty yards in length and a base of  perhaps thirty yards. There must be nearly a thousand square yards of  lilies, and from five to ten lilies to the yard, green buds, opening  blossoms, and great white cups and gold-centred chalices, wet and  swaying in the wind. Through all the summer those lilies flower, and  there cannot be as many people see them as there are lilies.  Fortunately, it would be difficult to find them unless you were walking:  you could not drive a motor-car or ride a bicycle down those sandy  lanes, and nobody on foot would pick the lilies.    To walk from Frensham Little Pond over Tilford Common to Tilford is to  traverse some of the wildest and freshest commonland in Surrey. For some  distance from the northern corner of the pond the way runs through  woodland, crossed and recrossed by so many sandy paths that it is a good  deal easier to get lost than to find the high road running into Tilford  from the south. It is worth while getting lost, for that matter, if only  to realise the wildness of the place; though it would perhaps be better  to choose daytime for the business, for there are some awkward-looking,  though perhaps not dangerous, bogs on the lower ground near the Wey.  This lower ground, by the way, is a wonderful place for rabbits. You  come suddenly out from the wood on the border of a reedy field, and see  dozens of scampering bodies cleaving paths through the shaking rushes.  Now and then a rabbit, puzzled by the silence following the sound of the  invader's coming, sits and cocks up a pair of ears above the grass; his  head goes a little higher, his timorous eye catches yours, and the  greenery closes behind him.    Tilford to-day cannot be very different from the Tilford of the days of  Cobbett. It is a straggling little hamlet, lying about the triangle  formed by its cricket-green. The Wey runs halfway round the green, and  is crossed by two grey and ancient bridges. But the chief glory of  Tilford is its mighty oak, one of the greatest of English trees. Its age  is unknown, and perhaps would hardly be known if it were felled. It has  been claimed as \"the oak at Kynghoc,\" mentioned in the charter given to  Waverley Abbey in 1128; but that oak is mentioned as standing on the  Abbeyland boundary, and the Tilford oak has never stood on the boundary.  These historic oaks make difficult problems. Wherever you find a great  tree, local legend gathers round it. Queen Elizabeth dined under it or  shot a stag under it; Charles II climbed in it; Wesley preached under  it; it is the boundary of the parish; it was the boundary of the  Abbeyland eight hundred years ago. But was it always, then, the greatest  tree for miles round? Eight hundred years ago, may there not have stood  another tree near where it stands to-day, as large or even larger?  Surely the traditions of one great tree pass, when the tree falls, to  its nearest great neighbour; but they pass so seldom, and so slowly,  that the villagers hardly note the change. Three generations are born  and die, and no villager living has seen the older greater oak; the  younger, slighter tree succeeds to its glories. Tilford's oak to-day is  called by all Tilford the King's Oak. On the old estate maps it is  Novel's Oak; Novel, perhaps, was a yeoman farmer.    [Illustration: _Between Tilford and Elstead._]    Cobbett made a curious mistake about the Tilford Oak. He and his son  were riding through Tilford to Farnham on an autumn day in 1822:--        \"We veered a little to the left after we came to Tilford, at which      place on the Green we stopped to look at an _oak tree_, which, when      I was a little boy, was but a very little tree, comparatively, and      which is now, take it altogether, by far the finest tree that I ever      saw in my life. The stem or shaft is short; that is to say, it is      short before you come to the first limbs; but it is full _thirty      feet round_, at about eight or ten feet from the ground. Out of the      stem there come not less than fifteen or sixteen limbs, many of      which are from five to ten feet round, and each of which would, in      fact, be considered a decent stick of timber. I am not judge enough      of timber to say anything about the quantity in the whole tree, but      my son stepped the ground, and, as nearly as we could judge, the      diameter of the extent of the branches was upwards of ninety feet,      which would make a circumference of about three hundred feet. The      tree is in full growth at this moment. There is a little hole in one      of the limbs; but with that exception, there appears not the      smallest sign of decay.\"    Visitors to Tilford can amuse themselves with trying over Cobbett's  measurements. I could not reach to measure it ten feet from the ground;  but at five feet I made its girth, in July, 1907, twenty-four feet nine  inches. Probably it was not much less when Cobbett was a little boy.  That independent, combative mind would not accept another's  measurements, and if he remembered the tree as a little tree, then a  little tree he was right in remembering. Since his day the signs of  decay have set in; the oak is still superb, but a Jubilee sapling has  been planted as a neighbour. Centuries hence the sapling, perhaps, will  be the King's Oak again.    Tilford has another memory of green old age. William Beldham--\"Silver  Billy,\" because of his straw-coloured hair--lived most of his life in  the village, where he kept an inn, and died in a cottage close under the  oak. He was born at Wrecclesham on February 5, 1766, and died February  20, 1862, aged 96, having played thirty-five years' unbroken \"great\"  cricket, as Lillywhite calls it--a finer name than first-class. Let John  Nyren, most discerning of biographers, describe him:--        \"William Beldham was a close-set, active man, standing about five      feet eight inches and a-half. He had light-coloured hair, a fair      complexion, and handsome as well as intelligent features. We used to      call him 'Silver Billy.' No one within my recollection could stop a      ball better, or make more brilliant hits all over the ground.      Wherever the ball was bowled, there she was hit away, and in the      most severe, venomous style. Besides this, he was so remarkably safe      a player; he was safer than the Bank, for no mortal ever thought of      doubting Beldham's stability. He received his instructions from a      gingerbread baker at Farnham, of the name of Harry Hall....        \"He would get in at the balls, and hit them away in a gallant style;      yet, in this single feat, I think I have seen him excelled; but when      he could cut them at the point of the bat he was in his glory; and      upon my life, their speed was as the speed of thought.\"    [Illustration: _The King's Oak, Tilford._]    When were the great days of Surrey cricket? When Surrey could lend All  England William Beldham, and still win--which they did twice--a Tilford  man might answer. At all events, they were days in which cricketers  lived to heroic ages.
