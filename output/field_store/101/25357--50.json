Square up the front posts to length. From the single piece specified cut  out the back posts, giving them the amount of slant indicated in the  drawing. Set these four posts upright in the positions they are to  occupy relative to one another in the finished piece, and mark off, as  with penciled circles, the approximate locations of mortises. After  this, lay them on the bench side by side, even the lower ends and locate  accurately the ends of the mortises. Gauge their sides.    Saw the rails to length and lay out the shoulder lines and the cheeks of  the tenons and cut them. Plan to house the ends of the slats in the back  rails.    [Illustration: Side Chair of Dining-Room Set]    While the drawing shows a chair in which the front and back are of equal  width, the amateur may make the back narrower if he so desires. A  measurement of a common chair will give the proportions.    [Illustration: Detail of the Side Chair]    Place the front and the back in the clamps and after the glue has had  time to harden, assemble the remaining parts. Thoroughly scrape and  sandpaper all the parts, carefully removing any surplus glue. Wood  finish will not \"take hold\" where any glue has been allowed to remain.    The seat may be given the same treatment as suggested for the armchair.  This should not be done, however, until the finish has been applied.    A simple finish is obtained by the application of a coat of paste filler  of a soft brown color, if oak has been used. Apply and clean this off in  the manner directed by the manufacturers and after it has had 24 hours  in which to harden, sand it lightly with No. 00 paper. Over this apply a  thin coat of shellac. Allow this to harden, then sandpaper lightly with  fine paper. Upon the shellac apply several coats of some good rubbing  wax. Follow the directions that are to be found upon the cans, being  careful not to apply too much at a time. If too much wax is applied, it  stays in the small pores of the wood and produces an ugly chalk-like  appearance.          ANOTHER PIANO BENCH      The piano bench shown is best made of black walnut or oak and should be  finished in the natural color for walnut, but stained some rich brown  for oak.    The following pieces will be needed:      1 top, 1 by 15-1/2 by 38-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 legs, 1 by 14-1/2 by 20-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 rails, 7/8 by 3-3/4 by 36-1/2 in., S-2-S.    1 stretcher, 3/4 by 4-1/4 by 37 in., S-2-S.    The keys can be secured from the waste that will be cut off from the  other parts.    Square up the top in the usual manner to the size indicated in the  working drawing. In a similar manner square up the stretcher to width  and length.    There will be no need to square the ends of the rails as they are to be  cut off on a slant. Square up the sides or edges and then lay off and  cut the slanting ends, smoothing them with the plane. Lay off and work  the shape on their under edges.    [Illustration: Detail of the Piano Bench]    The ends are best laid off by means of a template or pattern for which a  piece of rather heavy paper will do. Lay off the main dimensions on a  center line. Sketch in the curve of the edge after the slant has been  laid out. Lay out the form at the bottom, then fold the paper along the  center line and trace the other half. With this pattern lay off the  outline upon the wood. For convenience in laying out the grooves for the  rails and the mortise for the tenon on the stretcher, it is well to work  a face edge upon each leg and allow this to remain until these joints  have been made and the parts fitted. The shape at the bottom of the leg  is merely suggestive and may be modified as desired.    Lay out and work the tenons on the stretcher. Then lay out and work the  grooves upon the rails. Each side of each rail is grooved 1/8 in, to  allow the leg to be recessed. This is done to give the bench the bracing  that is needed to make it stand firmly. Work the grooves in the legs and  the mortises for the rails.    [Illustration: Piano Bench in Quarter-Sawed Oak]    It should be noted that the mortise for the key in the stretcher must be  laid out before the shoulders and cheeks of the tenon on which the  mortise is made are cut off. Otherwise there would be no place to put  the gauge in marking the sides of the mortise for the key.    Thoroughly scrape all the parts and then assemble them. No glue is  needed. The rails are held in place by dowel pins, the heads of which  are allowed to project slightly and rounded so as to give an ornamental  effect. The top is attached by means of small angle irons or by means of  blocks and screws fastened to the corners made by top and rails.          ANOTHER SCREEN      The screen shown in the accompanying illustration is made of burlap and  plain-sawed oak. The stock list follows:      2 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 40 in., S-4-S.    2 base pieces, 3 by 3 by 12-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 horizontals, 3/4 by 4-1/4 by 38 in., S-2-S.    1 horizontal, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 38 in., S-2-S.    1 vertical, 3/4 by 1-3/4 by 20 in., S-2-S.    4 braces, 1-1/8 by 4-1/4 by 6-1/2 in., S-2-S.    The two base pieces may be shaped first. The drawing shows the form and  the dimensions. Make use of a face edge in laying out the mortises in  the base pieces for the uprights, before these face edges are removed to  make the slanting sides.    Work the verticals to length, laying out and cutting the tenons at the  bottoms, and shaping the tops as shown.    Lay out and shape the three horizontals as shown, working the tenons  upon the ends of each and the mortises in the lower two for the tenons  of the middle vertical.    For the braces, secure a face edge on each piece and square one end of  each to that. Lay off the curve free-hand upon one block and cut it out.  Use this block as a pattern or template to lay off the others.    Thoroughly scrape and sandpaper all the parts, then assemble them,  using clamps and good hot glue. Take care to see that there is no warp  in the frame as it lies in the clamps. After the glue on the frame has  hardened, remove the clamps and attach the base blocks and the braces.  The braces are secured by means of round-head screws.    [Illustration: Plain-Oak Frame with Burlap Panels]    Remove the surplus glue and then apply a finish as desired.    For the paneling, frames will be needed about which to fasten the  burlap. These may be made of 1/2-in, soft wood and the following pieces  will be necessary:      2 pieces, 1/2 by 2 by 36 in., S-2-S.    2 pieces, 1/2 by 2 by 8 in., S-2-S.    4 pieces, 1/2 by 2 by 18 in., S-2-S.    4 pieces, 1/2 by 2 by 19 in., S-2-S.    Make these frames enough smaller than the openings they are to occupy to  allow for burlap and tacks. These frames are held in place by putting  fixed nails in the top of each frame before the burlap is attached.  Holes are bored in the rails to correspond to them. The lower edges of  the frames are held in place by nails inserted up through the rails upon  which the frames rest.    [Illustration: Detail of the Frame]          A FOLDING CARD TABLE      The accompanying sketch shows the details of a card table that can be  folded up and carried about or stored away when not in use. We would  advise making two tables at the same time, as the material for both can  be purchased nearly as cheaply as for one. The material necessary for  making one table is given in the following list:       1 piece, 7/8 by 1-3/16 by 27-1/2 in., basswood or poplar.     2 pieces, 7/8 by 1-3/16 by 29-1/4 in., basswood or poplar.     4 legs, 1 in. square, 24-3/4 in. long; oak.     4 pieces, 1 in. square, 5 in. long; oak.     4 side pieces, 3/8 by 1-3/8 by 29-5/8 in.; oak.     4 pieces, 27-1/2 in. long, single groove electric wire moulding with       batten.     1 piece cardboard, 1/8 in. thick, 29-1/4 in. square.     4 pieces brass rod, 3-16 in. diameter, 15 in. long.    30 small copper washers, 3/8 or 7/16 in. outside diameter and drilled       3/16 in.     4 brass corners, 1-3/8 in, deep.     2-1/2 doz. No. 5 oval head brass screws, 3/4 in. long.     4 No. 2, 7/8-in. rubber screw tips.     1 piece felt, 1 yd. square.     1 sheet wadding, 1 yd. square (if pad is wanted under felt).     1 pt. wood stain.     3 doz. No. 14 wire beads, 2 in. long.    Some 2-oz., 4-oz., and 6-oz. flat-head tacks.    Begin by squaring up the four legs making them all 24-3/4 in. long and 1  in. square. Also square up the crosspieces marked B in the detail  drawing. These should be 5 in. long and should have 1/4-in. holes about  1 in. deep drilled in both ends of each for the 1/4-in. oak swivel pins.  Measure back 1-1/2 in. from one end of each and bore a 9/16-in. hole,  7/8 in. deep as shown. Now cut a tenon on one end of each leg, 3/4 in.  long, that will fit tightly in this 9/16-in. hole. Round the corners of  the piece B at the top as shown at C. Fasten the two pieces together  with glue and brads, being careful to get them square with each other.  After the glue is set bore a 3/16-in. hole in the center of the leg, 7  in. from the edge of the crosspiece, for the brace rod. Bevel the  corners as shown. Sandpaper them smooth, then stain and polish.    [Illustration: Detail of the Card Table]    [Illustration: Card Table Ready for Use]    Lay the two pieces marked D and E in the sketch on a level surface with  the 7/8-in. edge up, place the cardboard on top and tack it fast to the  pieces, using 6-oz. tacks. Place the center piece in and tack it fast  also. Fasten the ends to the other pieces with brads. The four pieces of  electric wire moulding should each measure exactly 27-1/2 in. long, or  the same length as the center"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#9)"],[1," me, they are not  Dutchman's breeches and never could be.    [Illustration: The Seven Sour Sisters]      TALE 25    The Seven Sour Sisters    If you look along any half-open bank in the edge of the woods, or even  in the woods itself, you are sure to see one of the Seven Sorrel  Sisters, with leaves a little like Clover, only notched in the end and  without the white marks, that the Brownie put on the Clover. There are  seven of them, according to most doctors; five have yellow eyes, one  purple, and one white streaked with blood. Their Latin name means  \"vinegar\" and their Greek name means \"acid.\" \"Sorrel\" itself means  \"Little sour one,\" so you see they have the reputation of a sour bunch.  If you eat one of the leaves, you will agree that the name was  well-chosen, and understand why the druggists get the tart \"salt of  lemons\" from this family. The French use these Sour Sisters for their  sour soup. But in spite of their unsweetness, they are among the pretty  things of the woods; their forms are delicate and graceful; their eyes  are like jewels, and when the night comes down, they bow their heads,  gracefully fold their hands, and sleep like a lot of tired children.      TALE 26    Self-heal or Blue-curls in the Grass    [Illustration: Self-heal or Blue-curls in the Grass]    You should know the history of the lowly little flower called  Blue-curls; and you must remember that flowers have their troubles just  as you have. For one thing, flowers must get their pollen or yellow  flower-dust, carried to some other of their kind, or they cannot keep on  growing good seed. And since the flower cannot walk about finding places  for its pollen, it generally makes a bargain with a bee. It says, \"If  you will carry my pollen to my cousins yonder, I will give you a sweet  sip of nectar.\" That is where the bees get the stuff for all their  honey, and that is how the pollen is carried.    Well, the modest little Blue-curls long had had a working agreement with  the Meadow Bees, and got on nicely. But one summer Blue-curls became  discontented. She saw all the other plants with wonderful gifts that had  power to cure pain and sickness; while she was doing nothing but live  her own easy life, and she felt she was a nobody.    So one day as Mother Carey's slowest steed was swishing over the grass,  Blue-curls cried out: \"Mother Carey, Mother Carey, won't you hear me and  grant me a gift?\"    \"What is it, little one?\" said the All-mother.    \"Oh, Mother Carey, the pansy cures heartache, the monkshood cures  canker-lip, the tansy cures colds, and all the others have some joy and  honour of service, but I am good for nothing, Mother Carey so the wise  men despise me. Won't you give me a job? Won't you give me some little  power?\"    \"Little one, such an asking never finds me deaf. I love those who would  help. I will give you a little bit of _all healing_ so that you shall be  good medicine, if not the best, for all ills, and men shall call you  'Self-heal' and 'All-heal' for you shall have all healing in yourself.\"    And it has been so ever since. So that some who go by looks call the  modest little meadow flower, \"Blue-curls in the Grass,\" but the old  herb-men who know her goodness call her \"All-heal\" or \"Self-heal.\"      TALE 27    The Four Butterflies You See Every Summer    [Illustration: Summer Butterflies (a little over life size)]    There are four Butterflies that you are sure to see every summer, on our  fields; and remember that each of them goes through the same changes.  First it is an egg, then a greedy grub, next a hanging bundle-baby,  and last a beautiful winged fairy, living a life of freedom and joy.    In the picture I have shown the butterflies life size, but you must add  the colour as you get each one to copy.    The first is the _White_ or _Cabbage Butterfly_ that flits over our  gardens all summer long.    It is not a true American, but came from Europe in 1860 and landed at  Quebec, from whence it has spread all over the country. In the drawing I  have shown the female; the male is nearly the same but has only one  round dark spot on the front wings. Its grub is a little naked green  caterpillar, that eats very nearly a million dollars' worth of cabbages  a year; so it is a pity it was ever allowed to land in this country.  There are moths that we should like to get rid of, but this is the only  butterfly that is a pest.    2nd. The _Yellow_ or _Clouded Sulphur Butterfly_. You are sure to find  it, as soon as you begin to look for butterflies. This is the one that  is often seen in flocks about mud puddles.    When I was a very small boy, I once caught a dozen of them, and made a  little beehive to hold them, thinking that they would settle down and  make themselves at home, just like bees or pigeons. But the grown-ups  made me let them fly away, for the Sulphur is a kindly creature, and  does little or no harm.    One of the most beautiful things I ever came across, was, when about ten  years old, I saw on a fence stake ahead of me a big bird that was red,  white and blue, with a flaming yellow fan-crest. Then as I came closer,  I knew that it was a red-headed woodpecker, with a Sulphur Butterfly in  his beak; this made the crest; what I thought was blue turned out to be  his glossy black back reflecting the blue sky.    3rd. The next is the _Red Admiral_ or _Nettle Butterfly_. The \"red\" part  of the name is right, but why \"Admiral\"? I never could see unless it was  misprint for \"Admirable.\"    [Illustration: Red Admiral]    [Illustration: Tiger Swallowtail (life size)]    This beautiful insect lays its eggs and raises its young on nettles, and  where nettles are, there is the Red Admiral also. And that means over  nearly all the world! Its caterpillar is not very well protected with  bristles, not at all when compared with the Woolly-bear, but it lives in  the nettles, and, whether they like it or not, the hospitable nettles  with their stings protect the caterpillar. The crawler may be grateful,  but he shows it in a poor way, for he turns on the faithful nettle, and  eats it up. In fact the only food he cares about is nettle-salad, and he  indulges in it several times a day, yes all day long, eating, growing  and bursting his skin a number of times, till he is big enough to hang  himself up for the winter, probably in a nettle. Then next spring he  comes forth, in the full dress uniform of a Red Admiral, gold lace, red  sash, silver braid and all.    4th. The last of the four is the _Tiger Swallowtail_. You are sure to  see it some day--the big yellow butterfly that is striped like a tiger,  with peacock's feathers in its train, and two long prongs, like a  swallow-tail, to finish off with. It is found in nearly all parts of the  Eastern States and Canada. I saw great flocks of them on the Slave River  of the North.    It is remarkable in that there are both blondes and brunettes among its  ladies. The one shown in the drawing is a blonde. The brunettes are so  much darker as to be nearly black; and so different that at one time  everyone thought they were of a different kind altogether.      TALE 28    The Beautiful Poison Caterpillar    [Illustration: The Beautiful Poison Caterpillar (the moth is a little  over life size)]    The lovely Io Moth is one that you will see early, and never forget, for  it is common, and ranges over all the country from Canada to the Gulf.  When you see it, you will be inclined to spell its name Eye-oh--for it  has on each wing a splendid eye like that on a peacock's tail-feather,  while the rest of its dress is brown velvet and gold.    There is a strange chapter in the life of Io, which you should know  because it shows that Mother Carey never gives any wonderful gift to her  creatures without also giving with it some equal burden of sorrow.    This is how it all came about.    Long ago when the little ones of the Io Moth were small, they were, like  most caterpillars, very ugly little things. They felt very badly about  it, and so they set out one day for the great Home Place of Mother Carey  in the Whispering Grove of the Ages.    There they prayed, \"Dear Mother Carey, we are not of an ugly race, why  should we be so ugly as caterpillars? Will you not make us beautiful,  for beauty is one of the best things of all?\"    Mother Carey smiled and waved a finger toward a little Brownie, who came  with a tray on which were two cups; one full of bright sparkling pink  stuff, and the other with something that looked like dark green oil. But  the glasses were joined at the top, there was but one place to drink,  and that reached both.    Then Mother Carey said, \"These are the goblets of life, one is balm and  will give you joy, the other is gall and will give you suffering. You  may drink little or much, but you must drink equally of both. Now what  would ye?\"    The little ugly creatures whispered together, then one said: \"Mother  Carey, if we drink, will it give us beauty?\"    \"Yes, my children, the red goblet of life will give you beauty, but with  it the other will give you grief.\"    They whispered together, then all the little crawlers went silently  forward, and each took a long drink of the double goblet.    Then they crawled away, and at once became the most beautiful of all  caterpillars, brilliant jewel-green with stripes of pink, velvet, and  gold. Never before were there seen such exquisite little crawlers.    But now a sad thing happened. They were so beautiful that many creatures  became their enemies, and began to kill them and eat them one after  another. They crawled as fast as they could, and hid away, but many of  them were killed by birds and beasts of prey, as well as by big fierce  insects.    They did not know what to do, so next day the few that were left crawled  back to the Grove of Ages, and once more stood before Mother Carey.    \"Well, my Beauty-crawlers,\" she said, \"what would you?\"    \"Oh, Mother Carey, it is fearful, everyone"]]]
