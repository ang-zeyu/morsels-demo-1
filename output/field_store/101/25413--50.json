Pardon me, but there is the door, and I trust that  you will never enter my room again.\"    She sprang to her feet in deep confusion, and passed through the door,  murmuring: \"Very well; you will live to regret your action today.\"    \"Never, never!\" I exclaimed, and closed the door after her with a bang.  I afterwards learned that this woman was an actress, and that her object  was to enter the White House as a servant, learn its secrets, and then  publish a scandal to the world. I do not give her name, for such  publicity would wound the sensitive feelings of friends, who would have  to share her disgrace, without being responsible for her faults. I  simply record the incident to show how I often was approached by  unprincipled parties. It is unnecessary to say that I indignantly  refused every bribe offered.    The first public appearance of Mrs. Lincoln that winter was at the  reception on New Year's Day. This reception was shortly followed by a  brilliant levee. The day after the levee I went to the White House, and  while fitting a dress to Mrs. Lincoln, she said:    \"Lizabeth\"--she had learned to drop the E--\"Lizabeth, I have an idea.  These are war times, and we must be as economical as possible. You know  the President is expected to give a series of state dinners every  winter, and these dinners are very costly; Now I want to avoid this  expense; and my idea is, that if I give three large receptions, the  state dinners can be scratched from the programme. What do you think,  Lizabeth?\"    \"I think that you are right, Mrs. Lincoln.\"    \"I am glad to hear you say so. If I can make Mr. Lincoln take the same  view of the case, I shall not fail to put the idea into practice.\"    Before I left her room that day, Mr. Lincoln came in. She at once stated  the case to him. He pondered the question a few moments before  answering.    \"Mother, I am afraid your plan will not work.\"    \"But it _will_ work, if you will only determine that it _shall_ work.\"    \"It is breaking in on the regular custom,\" he mildly replied.    \"But you forget, father, these are war times, and old customs can be  done away with for the once. The idea is economical, you must admit.\"    \"Yes, mother, but we must think of something besides economy.\"    \"I do think of something else. Public receptions are more democratic  than stupid state dinners--are more in keeping with the spirit of the  institutions of our country, as you would say if called upon to make a  stump speech. There are a great many strangers in the city, foreigners  and others, whom we can entertain at our receptions, but whom we cannot  invite to our dinners.\"    \"I believe you are right, mother. You argue the point well. I think that  we shall have to decide on the receptions.\"    So the day was carried. The question was decided, and arrangements were  made for the first reception. It now was January, and cards were issued  for February.    The children, Tad and Willie, were constantly receiving presents. Willie  was so delighted with a little pony, that he insisted on riding it every  day. The weather was changeable, and exposure resulted in a severe cold,  which deepened into fever. He was very sick, and I was summoned to his  bedside. It was sad to see the poor boy suffer. Always of a delicate  constitution, he could not resist the strong inroads of disease. The  days dragged wearily by, and he grew weaker and more shadow-like. He was  his mother's favorite child, and she doted on him. It grieved her heart  sorely to see him suffer. When able to be about, he was almost  constantly by her side. When I would go in her room, almost always I  found blue-eyed Willie there, reading from an open book, or curled up in  a chair with pencil and paper in hand. He had decidedly a literary  taste, and was a studious boy. A short time before his death he wrote  this simple little poem:      \"WASHINGTON, D. C., October 30, 1861.       DEAR SIR:--I enclose you my first attempt at poetry.          \"Yours truly,        \"WM. W. LINCOLN.      \"_To the Editor of the National Republican._\"      LINES ON THE DEATH OF COLONEL EDWARD BAKER.        THERE was no patriot like Baker,        So noble and so true;      He fell as a soldier on the field,        His face to the sky of blue.        His voice is silent in the hall        Which oft his presence graced;      No more he'll hear the loud acclaim        Which rang from place to place.        No squeamish notions filled his breast,        _The Union_ was his theme;      \"_No surrender and no compromise_,\"        His day-thought and night's dream.        His Country has _her_ part to pay        To'rds those he has left behind;      His widow and his children all,        She must always keep in mind.    Finding that Willie continued to grow worse, Mrs. Lincoln determined to  withdraw her cards of invitation and postpone the reception. Mr. Lincoln  thought that the cards had better not be withdrawn. At least he advised  that the doctor be consulted before any steps were taken. Accordingly  Dr. Stone was called in. He pronounced Willie better, and said that  there was every reason for an early recovery. He thought, since the  invitations had been issued, it would be best to go on with the  reception. Willie, he insisted, was in no immediate danger. Mrs. Lincoln  was guided by these counsels, and no postponement was announced. On the  evening of the reception Willie was suddenly taken worse. His mother sat  by his bedside a long while, holding his feverish hand in her own, and  watching his labored breathing. The doctor claimed there was no cause  for alarm. I arranged Mrs. Lincoln's hair, then assisted her to dress.  Her dress was white satin, trimmed with black lace. The trail was very  long, and as she swept through the room, Mr. Lincoln was standing with  his back to the fire, his hands behind him, and his eyes on the carpet.  His face wore a thoughtful, solemn look. The rustling of the satin dress  attracted his attention. He looked at it a few moments; then, in his  quaint, quiet way remarked--    \"Whew! our cat has a long tail to-night.\"    Mrs. Lincoln did not reply. The President added:    \"Mother, it is my opinion, if some of that tail was nearer the head, it  would be in better style;\" and he glanced at her bare arms and neck. She  had a beautiful neck and arm, and low dresses were becoming to her. She  turned away with a look of offended dignity, and presently took the  President's arm, and both went down-stairs to their guests, leaving me  alone with the sick boy.    The reception was a large and brilliant one, and the rich notes of the  Marine Band in the apartments below came to the sick-room in soft,  subdued murmurs, like the wild, faint sobbing of far-off spirits. Some  of the young people had suggested dancing, but Mr. Lincoln met the  suggestion with an emphatic veto. The brilliance of the scene could not  dispel the sadness that rested upon the face of Mrs. Lincoln. During the  evening she came upstairs several times, and stood by the bedside of the  suffering boy. She loved him with a mother's heart, and her anxiety was  great. The night passed slowly; morning came, and Willie was worse. He  lingered a few days, and died. God called the beautiful spirit home, and  the house of joy was turned into the house of mourning. I was worn out  with watching, and was not in the room when Willie died, but was  immediately sent for. I assisted in washing him and dressing him, and  then laid him on the bed, when Mr. Lincoln came in. I never saw a man so  bowed down with grief. He came to the bed, lifted the cover from the  face of his child, gazed at it long and earnestly, murmuring, \"My poor  boy, he was too good for this earth. God has called him home. I know  that he is much better off in heaven, but then we loved him so. It is  hard, hard to have him die!\"    Great sobs choked his utterance. He buried his head in his hands, and  his tall frame was convulsed with emotion. I stood at the foot of the  bed, my eyes full of tears, looking at the man in silent, awe-stricken  wonder. His grief unnerved him, and made him a weak, passive child. I  did not dream that his rugged nature could be so moved. I shall never  forget those solemn moments--genius and greatness weeping over love's  idol lost. There is a grandeur as well as a simplicity about the picture  that will never fade. With me it is immortal--I really believe that I  shall carry it with me across the dark, mysterious river of death.    Mrs. Lincoln's grief was inconsolable. The pale face of her dead boy  threw her into convulsions. Around him love's tendrils had been twined,  and now that he was dressed for the tomb, it was like tearing the  tendrils out of the heart by their roots. Willie, she often said, if  spared by Providence, would be the hope and stay of her old age. But  Providence had not spared him. The light faded from his eyes, and the  death-dew had gathered on his brow.    In one of her paroxysms of grief the President kindly bent over his  wife, took her by the arm, and gently led her to the window. With a  stately, solemn gesture, he pointed to the lunatic asylum.    \"Mother, do you see that large white building on the hill yonder? Try  and control your grief, or it will drive you mad, and we may have to  send you there.\"    Mrs. Lincoln was so completely overwhelmed with sorrow that she did not  attend the funeral. Willie was laid to rest in the cemetery, and the  White House was draped in mourning. Black crape everywhere met the eye,  contrasting strangely with the gay and brilliant colors of a few days  before. Party dresses were laid aside, and every one who crossed the  threshold of the Presidential mansion spoke in subdued tones when they  thought of the sweet boy at rest--    \"Under the sod and the dew.\"    Previous to this I had lost my son. Leaving Wilberforce, he went to the  battle-field with the three"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24989"],[0,"A Short Method Of Prayer (#9)"],[1," if we were to give them first _the key of  the interior_, the outside would be reformed at once with a natural  facility.    And this is very easy. To teach them to seek God in their heart, to  think of Him, to return to Him when they find they have turned away, to  do all and suffer all for the sake of pleasing Him--this is to direct  them to the source of all grace, and to make them find there all that is  necessary for their sanctification. O you who serve souls! I conjure you  to put them first of all into this way, which is Jesus Christ; and it is  He who conjures you to do this by the blood He has shed for the souls He  confides to your care. \"Speak to the heart of Jerusalem\" (Isa. xl. 2,  marg.) O dispensers of His grace, preachers of His Word, ministers of  sacraments! establish His kingdom; and, in order to establish it truly,  make it reign over HEARTS. For as it is the heart alone which can oppose  His empire, it is by the subjection of the heart that His sovereignty is  most honoured. Alas! we seek to make _studied_ prayers; and by wishing  to arrange them too much, we render them impossible. We have alienated  children from the best of Fathers, in seeking to teach them a polished  language. Go, poor children, and speak to your Heavenly Father in your  natural language: however uncultivated it may be, it is not so to Him. A  father loves best the speech which is put in disorder by love and  respect, because he sees that it comes from the heart: it is more to him  than a dry harangue, vain and unfruitful though well studied. Oh, how  certain glances of love charm and ravish Him! They express infinitely  more than all language and reason. By wishing to teach how to love Love  Himself with method, much of this love has been lost. Oh! it is not  necessary to teach the art of loving. The language of love is barbarous  to him who does not love; and we cannot learn to love God better than  by loving Him. The Spirit of God does not need our arrangements; He  takes shepherds at His pleasure to make them prophets; and, far from  closing the palace of prayer to any, as it is imagined, He leaves the  doors open to all, and Wisdom is ordered to cry in the public places,  \"Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth  understanding, she saith to him, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the  wine which I have mingled\" (Prov. ix. 4, 5). Did not Christ thank His  Father that He had hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and  had revealed them to babes? (Matt. xi. 25.)          CHAPTER XIX.    AFTER THE PRECEDING WAYS, THERE REMAINS AN AFTER WAY, PREPARATORY TO  DIVINE UNION, IN WHICH WISDOM AND JUSTICE MAKE THE PASSIVE PURIFICATION  OF THE SOUL, ALL WHICH IS TREATED IN DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING TREATISE,  ENTITLED \"SPIRITUAL TORRENTS.\"      It is impossible to attain divine union by the way of meditation alone,  or even by the affections, or by any luminous or understood prayer.  There are several reasons. These are the principal.    First, according to Scripture, \"No man shall see God and live\" (Exod.  xxxiii. 20). Now all discursive exercises of prayer, or even of _active  contemplation_, regarded as an end, and not as a preparation for the  _passive_, are exercises of life by which we cannot see God, that is,  become united to Him. All that is of man, and of his own industry,  however noble and elevated it may be, must die.    St John tells us that \"there was silence in heaven.\" Heaven represents  the depths and centre of the soul, where all must be in silence when the  majesty of God appears. All that belongs to our own efforts, or to  ourselves in any way, must be destroyed, because nothing is opposed to  God but appropriation, and all the malignity of man is in this  appropriation, which is the source of his evil; so that the more a soul  loses its appropriation, the more it becomes pure.    Secondly, in order to unite two things so opposed as the purity of God  and the impurity of the creature, the simplicity of God and the  multiplicity of the creature, God must operate alone; for this can never  be done by the effort of the creature, since two things cannot be united  unless there is some relation or resemblance between them, as an impure  metal would never unite with one that was pure and refined.    What does God do then? He sends before Him His own Wisdom, as fire will  be sent upon the earth to consume by its activity all the impurity that  is there. Fire consumes all things, and nothing resists its activity. It  is the same with Wisdom; it consumes all impurity in the creature, to  prepare him for divine union.    This impurity, so opposed to union, is appropriation and activity.  _Appropriation_, because it is the source of the real impurity which can  never be united to essential purity; as the sun's rays may touch the mud  but cannot unite with it. _Activity_, because God being in an infinite  repose, in order that the soul may be united to Him, it must participate  in His repose, without which there can be no union, because of the  dissemblance; and to unite two things, they must be in a proportionate  rest.    It is for this reason that the soul can only attain divine union by the  rest of its will; and it can only be united to God when it is in a  _central rest_ and in the purity of its creation.    To purify the soul God makes use of wisdom as fire is used for the  purification of gold. It is certain that gold can only be purified by  fire, which gradually consumes all that is earthly and foreign, and  separates it from the gold. It is not sufficient that the earth should  be changed into gold; it is necessary that the fire should melt and  dissolve it, to remove from it all that is earthly; and this gold is put  in the fire so many times that it loses its impurity, and all necessity  of purification. Then it is fit to be employed in the most excellent  workmanship.    And if this gold is impure in the end, it is because it has contracted  fresh defilement by coming in contact with other bodies. But this  impurity is only superficial, and does not prevent its being used;  whereas its former impurity was hidden within it, and, as it were,  identified with its nature.    In addition to this, you will remark that gold of an inferior degree of  purity cannot mix with that of a superior purity. The one must contract  the impurity of the other, or else impart its own purity to it. Put a  refined gold with an unrefined one, what can the goldsmith ever do with  it? He will have all the impurity taken from the second piece, that it  may be able to mix with the first. This is what St Paul tells us, that  \"the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is;\" he adds, that  if any man's work should be found to deserve burning, he should be saved  \"so as by fire\" (1 Cor. iii. 13, 15). That means, that though there are  some works which are good, and which God receives, yet, so that he who  has done them may be pure, they too must pass through the fire, in order  that all appropriation, that is, all that was his own, may be taken  from them. God will judge our righteousness, because \"by the deeds of  the law there shall no flesh be justified,\" but by \"the righteousness of  God, which is by faith\" (Rom. iii. 20, 22).    This being understood, I say that, in order that man may be united to  his God, wisdom and divine justice, like a pitiless and devouring fire,  must take from him all appropriation, all that is terrestrial, carnal,  and of his own activity; and having taken all this from him, they must  unite him to God.    This is never brought about by the labours of the creature; on the  contrary, it even causes him regret, because, as I have said, man so  loves what is his own, and is so fearful of its destruction, that if God  did not accomplish it Himself, and by His own authority, man would never  consent to it.    It will be objected to this, that God never deprives man of his liberty,  and that therefore he can always resist God; for which reason I ought  not to say that _God acts absolutely, without the consent of man_. In  explanation I say, that it is sufficient that man should give a  _passive consent_, that he may have entire and full liberty; because  having at the beginning given himself to God, that He may do as He will  both with him and in him, he gave from that time an _active_ and general  assent to all that God might do. But when God destroys, burns, and  purifies, the soul does not see that all this is for its advantage; it  rather believes the contrary: and as at first the fire seems to tarnish  the gold, so this operation seems to despoil the soul of its purity. So  that if an _active_ and _explicit_ consent were required, the soul would  find a difficulty in giving it, and often would not give it. All that it  does is to remain in a passive contentment, enduring this operation as  well as it can, being neither able nor willing to prevent it.    God then so purifies this soul of all natural, distinct, and perceived  operations, that at last He makes it more and more _conformed_ to  Himself, and then _uniform_, raising the passive capacity of the  creature, enlarging it and ennobling it, though in a hidden and  unperceived manner, which is termed mystical. But in all these  operations the soul must concur passively, and in proportion as the  working of God becomes stronger, the soul must continually yield to Him,  until He absorbs it altogether. We do not say, then, as some assert,  that there must be no _action_; since, on the contrary, this is _the  door_; but only that _we must not remain in it_, seeing that man should  tend towards the perfection of his end, and that he can never reach it  without quitting the first means, which, though they were necessary to  introduce him into the way, would greatly hinder him afterwards, if he  attached himself obstinately to them. This is what Paul said, \"I forget  those things which are behind, and reach forth"]]]
