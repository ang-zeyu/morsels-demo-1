A  correspondent of Cyprian, the celebrated African bishop,  describes a woman who pretended 'to be inspired by the Holy  Ghost, but was really acted on by a diabolical spirit, by which  she counterfeited ecstasies, and pretended to prophesy, and  wrought many wonderful and strange things, and boasted she would  cause the earth to move. Not that the devil [he is cautious to  affirm] has so great a power either to move the earth or shake  the elements by his command; but the wicked spirit, foreseeing  and understanding that there will be an earthquake, pretends to  do that which he foresees will shortly come to pass. And by these  lies and boastings, the devil subdued the minds of many to obey  and follow him whithersoever he would lead them. And he made that  woman walk barefoot through the snow in the depth of winter, and  feel no trouble nor harm by running about in that fashion. But at  last, after having played many such pranks, one of the exorcists  of the Church discovered her to be a cheat, and showed that to be  a wicked spirit which before was thought to be the Holy  Ghost.'[36]      [36] _Origines Ecclesiasticae_, xvi. The exorcists were a    recognised and respectable order in the Church. See id. iii.    for an account of the _Energumenoi_ or demoniacs. The lawyer    Ulpian, in the time of Tertullian, mentions the Order of    Exorcists as well known. St. Augustin (_De Civit. Dei_,    xxii. 8) records some extraordinary cures on his own    testimony within his diocess of Hippo.    Christian witchcraft was of a more tremendous nature than even  that of older times, both in its origin and practice. The devils  of Christianity were the metamorphosed deities of the old  religions. The Christian convert was convinced, and the Fathers  of the Church gravely insisted upon the fact, that the oracles of  Delphi or Dodona had been inspired in the times of ignorance and  idolatry by the great Enemy, who used the priest or priestess as  the means of accomplishing his eternal schemes of malice and  mischief. At the instant, however (so it was confidently  affirmed), of the divine incarnation the oracular temples were  closed for ever; and the demons were no longer permitted to  delude mankind by impersonating pagan deities. They must now find  some other means of effecting their fixed purpose. It was not far  to seek. There were human beings who, by a preeminently wicked  disposition, or in hope of some temporary profit, were prepared  to risk their future prospects, willing to devote both soul and  body to the service of hell. The 'Fathers' and great expounders  of Christianity, by their sentiments, their writings, and  their claims to the miraculous powers of exorcising, greatly  assisted to advance the common opinions. Justin Martyr, Origen,  Tertullian, Jerome, were convinced that they were in perpetual  conflict with the disappointed demons of the old world, who had  inspired the oracles and usurped the worship of the true God. Nor  was the contest always merely spiritual: they engaged personally  and corporeally. St. Jerome, like St. Dunstan in the tenth, or  Luther in the sixteenth century, had to fight with an incarnate  demon.    Exorcism--the magical or miraculous ejection of evil spirits by a  solemn form of adjuration--was a universal mode of asserting the  superior authority of the orthodox Church against the spurious  pretensions of heretics.[37]      [37] The art of expelling demons, indeed, has been preserved    in the Protestant section of the Christian Church until a    recent age. The _exorcising_ power, it is remarkable, is the    sole claim to miraculous privilege of the Protestants. The    formula _de Strumosis Attrectandis_, or the form of touching    for the king's evil (a similar claim), was one of the    recognised offices of the English Established Church in the    time of Queen Anne, or of George I.    Christian theology in the first age even was considerably indebted  to the Platonic doctrines as taught in the Alexandrian school; and  demonology in the third century received considerable accessions  from the speculations of Neo-Platonism, the reconciling medium  between Greek and Oriental philosophy. Philo-Judaeus (whose  reconciling theories, displayed in his attempt to prove the  derivation of Greek religious or philosophical ideas from those  of Moses, have been ingeniously imitated by a crowd of modern  followers) had been the first to undertake to adapt the Jewish  theology to Greek philosophy. Plotinus and Porphyrius, the  founders of the new school of Platonism, introduced a large number  of angels or demons to the acquaintance of their Christian  fellow-subjects in the third century.[38] It has been remarked that  'such was the mild spirit of antiquity that the nations were less  attentive to the difference than to the resemblance of their  religious worship. The Greek, the Roman, and the barbarian, as  they met before their respective altars, easily persuaded themselves  that, under various names and with various ceremonies, they adored  the same deities.'[39] Magianism and Judaism, however, were little  imbued with the spirit of toleration; and the purer the form of  religious worship, the fiercer, too often, seems to be the  persecution of differing creeds. Christianity, with something of  the spirit of Judaism from which it sprung, was forced to believe  that the older religions must have sprung from a diabolic origin.  The whole pagan world was inspired and dominated by wicked  spirits. 'The pagans _deified_, the Christians _diabolised_,  Nature.'[40] It is in this fact that the entirely opposite  spirit of antique and mediaeval thought, evident in the life,  literature, in the common ideas of ancient and mediaeval Europe,  is discoverable.      [38] 'The knowledge that is suited to our situation and    powers, the whole compass of moral, natural, and    mathematical science, was neglected by the new Platonists;    whilst they exhausted their strength in the verbal disputes    of metaphysics, they attempted to explore the secrets of the    invisible world, and studied to reconcile Aristotle with    Plato on subjects of which both these philosophers were as    ignorant as the rest of mankind. Consuming their reason in    those deep but unsubstantial meditations, their minds were    exposed to illusions of fancy. They flattered themselves    that they possessed the secret of disengaging the soul from    its corporeal prison; claimed a familiar intercourse with    demons and spirits; and by a very singular revolution,    converted the study of philosophy into that of magic.'--_The    Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, chap. xiii.      [39] The Egyptians, almost the only exception to polytheistic    tolerance, seem to have been rendered intolerant by the    number of antagonistic animal-gods worshipped in different    parts of the country, enumerated by Juvenal, who describes    the effects of religious animosity displayed in a faction    fight between Ombi or Coptos and Tentyra.--_Sat._ xv.      [40] _Life of Goethe_, by G. H. Lewes.    The female sex has been always most concerned in the crime of  Christian witchcraft. What was the cause of this general  addiction, in the popular belief, of that sex, it is interesting  to inquire. In the East now, and in Greece of the age of  Simonides or Euripides, or at least in the Ionic States, women  are an inferior order of beings, not only on account of their  weaker natural faculties and social position, but also in respect  of their natural inclination to every sort of wickedness. And if  they did not act the part of a Christian witch, they were skilled  in the practice of toxicology. With the Latin race and many  European peoples, the female sex held a better position; and  it may appear inconsistent that in Christendom, where the  Goddess-Mother was almost the highest object of veneration, woman  should be degraded into a slave of Satan. By the northern nations  they were supposed to be gifted with supernatural power; and the  universal powers of the Italian hag have been already noticed.  But the Church, which allowed no miracle to be legitimate out of  the pale, and yet could not deny the fact of the miraculous  without, was obliged to assert it to be of diabolic origin. Thus  the _priestess_ of antiquity became a _witch_. This is the  historical account. Physically, the cause seems discoverable in  the fact that the natural constitution of women renders their  _imaginative_ organs more excitable for the ecstatic conditions  of the prophetic or necromantic arts. On all occasions of  religious or other cerebral excitement, women (it is a matter of  experience) are generally most easily reduced to the requisite  state for the expected supernatural visitation. Their hysterical  (_hystera_) natures are sufficiently indicative of the origin of  such hallucinations. Their magical or pharmaceutical attributes  might be derived from savage life, where the men are almost  exclusively occupied either in war or in the chase: everything  unconnected with these active or necessary pursuits is despised  as unbecoming the superior nature of the male sex. To the female  portion of the community are abandoned domestic employments,  preparation of food, the selection and mixture of medicinal  herbs, and all the mysteries of the medical art. How important  occupations like these, by ignorance and interest, might be  raised into something more than natural skill, is easy to be  conjectured. That so extraordinary an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#9)"],[1,"in the direction which  the finest minds of the race hold to be good; and that the only time  when it would not be wrong to feed upon such food would be when, owing  to misfortunes such as shipwreck, war, famine, etc., starvation can only  be kept at bay by the sacrifice of animal life. In such a case, man,  considering his own life the more valuable, must resort to the  unnatural practice of flesh-eating.    The reformer may have, indeed must have, to pay a price, and sometimes a  big one, for the privilege, the greatest of all privileges, of educating  his fellows to a realisation of their errors, to a realisation of a  better and nobler view of life than they have hitherto known. Seldom do  men who carve out a way for themselves, casting aside the conventional  prejudices of their day, and daring to proclaim, and live up to, the  truth they see, meet with the esteem and respect due to them; but this  should not, and, if they are sincere and courageous, does not, deter  them from announcing their message and caring for the personal  discomfort it causes. It is such as these that the world has to thank  for its progress.    It often happens that the reformer reaps not the benefit of the reform  he introduces. Men are slow to perceive and strangely slow to act, yet  he who has genuine affection for his fellows, and whose desire for the  betterment of humanity is no mere sentimental pseudo-religiosity, bears  bravely the disappointment he is sure to experience, and with undaunted  heart urges the cause that, as he sees it, stands for the enlightenment  and happiness of man. The vegetarian in the West (Europe, America, etc.)  is often ridiculed and spoken of by appellations neither complimentary  nor kind, but this should deter no honorable man or woman from entering  the ranks of the vegetarian movement as soon as he or she perceives the  moral obligation to do so. It may be hard, perhaps impossible, to  convert others to the same views, but the vegetarian is not hindered  from living his own life according to the dictates of his conscience.  'He who conquers others is strong, but the man who conquers himself is  mighty,' wrote Laotze in the _Tao Teh Ch'ing_, or 'The Simple Way.'    When we call to mind some heroic character--a Socrates, a Regulus, a  Savonarola--the petty sacrifices our duties entail seem trivial indeed.  We do well to remember that it is only by obedience to the highest  dictates of our own hearts and minds that we may obtain true happiness.  It is only by living in harmony with all living creatures that nobility  and purity of life are attainable. As we obey the immediate vision, so  do we become able to see yet richer visions: but the _strength of the  vision is ours only as we obey its high demands_.          NUTRITION AND DIET          I    THE SCIENCE OF NUTRITION      The importance of some general knowledge of the principles of nutrition  and the nutritive values of foods is not generally realised. Ignorance  on such a matter is not usually looked upon as a disgrace, but, on the  contrary, it would be commonly thought far more reprehensible to lack  the ability to conjugate the verb 'to be' than to lack a knowledge of  the chemical properties of the food we eat, and the suitability of it to  our organism. Yet the latter bears direct and intimate relation to man's  physical, mental, and moral well-being, while the former is but a  'sapless, heartless thistle for pedantic chaffinches,' as Jean Paul  would say.    The human body is the most complicated machine conceivable, and as it is  absurd to suppose that any tyro can take charge of so comparatively  simple a piece of mechanism as a locomotive, how much more absurd is it  to suppose the human body can be kept in fit condition, and worked  satisfactorily, without at least some, if only slight, knowledge of the  nature of its constitution, and an understanding of the means to  satisfy its requirements? Only by study and observation comes the  knowledge of how best to supply the required material which, by its  oxidation in the body, repairs waste, gives warmth and produces energy.    Considering, then, that the majority of people are entirely ignorant  both of the chemical constitution of the body, and the physiological  relationship between the body and food, it is not surprising to observe  that in respect to this question of caring for the body, making it grow  and work and think, many come to grief, having breakdowns which are  called by various big-sounding names. Indeed, to the student of  dietetics, the surprise is that the body is so well able to withstand  the abuse it receives.    It has already been explained in the previous essay how essential it is  if we live in an artificial environment and depart from primitive  habits, thereby losing natural instincts such as guide the wild animals,  that we should study diet. No more need be said on this point. It may  not be necessary that we should have some general knowledge of  fundamental principles, and learn how to apply them with reasonable  precision.    The chemical constitution of the human body is made up of a large  variety of elements and compounds. From fifteen to twenty elements are  found in it, chief among which are oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen,  calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and sulphur. The most important compounds  are protein, hydrocarbons, carbohydrates, organic mineral matter, and  water. The food which nourishes the body is composed of the same  elements and compounds.    Food serves two purposes,--it builds and repairs the body tissues, and  it generates vital heat and energy, burning food as fuel. Protein and  mineral matter serve the first purpose, and hydrocarbons (fats) and  carbohydrates (sugars and starches) the second, although, if too much  protein be assimilated it will be burnt as fuel, (but it is bad fuel as  will be mentioned later), and if too much fat is consumed it will be  stored away in the body as reserve supply. Most food contains some  protein, fat, carbohydrates, mineral matter, and water, but the  proportion varies very considerably in different foods.    Water is the most abundant compound in the body, forming on an average,  over sixty per cent. of the body by weight. It cannot be burnt, but is a  component part of all the tissues and is therefore an exceedingly,  important food. Mineral matter forms approximately five or six per cent.  of the body by weight. Phosphate of lime (calcium phosphate), builds  bone; and many compounds of potassium, sodium, magnesium and iron are  present in the body and are necessary nutrients. Under the term protein  are included the principal nitrogenous compounds which make bone, muscle  and other material. It forms about 15 per cent. of the body by weight,  and, as mentioned above, is burnt as fuel for generating heat and  energy. Carbohydrates form but a small proportion of the body-tissue,  less than one per cent. Starches, sugars, and the fibre of plants, or  cellulose, are included under this term. They serve the same purpose as  fat.    All dietitians are agreed that protein is the essential combined in  food. Deprivation of it quickly produces a starved physical condition.  The actual quantity required cannot be determined with perfect accuracy,  although estimates can be made approximately correct. The importance of  the other nutrient compounds is but secondary. But the system must have  all the nutrient compounds in correct proportions if it is to be  maintained in perfect health. These proportions differ slightly  according to the individual's physical constitution, temperament and  occupation.    Food replenishes waste caused by the continual wear and tear incidental  to daily life: the wear and tear of the muscles in all physical  exertion, of the brain in thinking, of the internal organs in the  digestion of food, in all the intricate processes of metabolism, in the  excretion of waste matter, and the secretion of vital fluids, etc. The  ideal diet is one which replenishes waste with the smallest amount of  suitable material, so that the system is kept in its normal condition of  health at a minimum of expense of energy. The value, therefore, of some  general knowledge of the chemical constituents of food is obvious. The  diet must be properly balanced, that is, the food eaten must provide  the nutrients the body requires, and not contain an excess of one  element or a deficiency of another. It is impossible to substitute  protein for fat, or _vice versa_, and get the same physiological result,  although the human organism is wonderfully tolerant of abuse, and  remarkably ingenious in its ability to adapt itself to abnormal  conditions.    It has been argued that it is essentially necessary for a well-balanced  dietary that the variety of food be large, or if the variety is to be  for any reason restricted, it must be chosen with great discretion.  Dietetic authorities are not agreed as to whether the variety should be  large or small, but there is a concensus of opinion that, be it large or  small, it should be selected with a view to supplying the proper  nutrients in proper proportions. The arguments, so far as the writer  understands them, for and against a large variety of foods, are as  follows:--    If the variety be large there is a temptation to over-feed. Appetite  does not need to be goaded by tasty dishes; it does not need to be  goaded at all. We should eat when hungry and until replenished; but to  eat when not hungry in order to gratify a merely sensual appetite, to  have dishes so spiced and concocted as to stimulate a jaded appetite by  novelty of taste, is harmful to an extent but seldom realised. Hence the  advisability, at least in the case of persons who have not attained  self-mastery over sensual desire, of having little variety, for then,  when the system is replenished, over-feeding is less likely to occur.    In this connection it should be remembered"]]]
