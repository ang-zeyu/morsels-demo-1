The sharp distinction of sap wood and heartwood is  wanting; the rings are not so clearly defined; the vessels of the  wood are small, very numerous, and rather evenly scattered through the  wood of the annual rings, so that the distinction of the ring almost  vanishes and the medullary or pith rays in poplar can be seen, without  being magnified, only on the radial section.               LIST OF MOST IMPORTANT BROAD-LEAVED TREES (HARDWOODS)    Woods of complex and very variable structure, and therefore differing  widely in quality, behavior, and consequently in applicability to the  arts.                                     AILANTHUS    =1. Ailanthus= (_Ailanthus glandulosa_). Medium to large-sized tree.  Wood pale yellow, hard, fine-grained, and satiny. This species  originally came from China, where it is known as the Tree of \"Heaven,\"  was introduced into the United States and planted near Philadelphia  during the 18th century, and is more ornamental than useful. It is  used to some extent in cabinet work. Western Pennsylvania and Long  Island, New York.                                        ASH    Wood heavy, hard, stiff, quite tough, not durable in contact with the  soil, straight-grained, rough on the split surfaces and coarse in  texture. The wood shrinks moderately, seasons with little injury,  stands well, and takes a good polish. In carpentry, ash is used for  stairways, panels, etc. It is used in shipbuilding, in the  construction of cars, wagons, etc., in the manufacture of all kinds of  farm implements, machinery, and especially of all kinds of furniture;  for cooperage, baskets, oars, tool handles, hoops, etc., etc. The  trees of the several species of ash are rapid growers, of small to  medium height with stout trunks. They form no forests, but occur  scattered in almost all our broad-leaved forests.    =2. White Ash= (_Fraxinus Americana_). Medium-, sometimes large-sized  tree. Heartwood reddish brown, usually mottled; sapwood lighter color,  nearly white. Wood heavy, hard, tough, elastic, coarse-grained,  compact structure. Annual rings clearly marked by large open pores,  not durable in contact with the soil, is straight-grained, and the  best material for oars, etc. Used for agricultural implements, tool  handles, automobile (rim boards), vehicle bodies and parts, baseball  bats, interior finish, cabinet work, etc., etc. Basin of the Ohio, but  found from Maine to Minnesota and Texas.    =3. Red Ash= (_Fraxinus pubescens_ var. _Pennsylvanica_). Medium-sized  tree, a timber very similar to, but smaller than _Fraxinus Americana_.  Heartwood light brown, sapwood lighter color. Wood heavy, hard,  strong, and coarse-grained. Ranges from New Brunswick to Florida, and  westward to Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas.    =4. Black Ash= (_Fraxinus nigra_ var. _sambucifolia_) (Hoop Ash, Ground  Ash). Medium-sized tree, very common, is more widely distributed than  the _Fraxinus Americana_; the wood is not so hard, but is well suited  for hoops and basketwork. Heartwood dark brown, sapwood light brown or  white. Wood heavy, rather soft, tough and coarse-grained. Used for  barrel hoops, basketwork, cabinetwork and interior of houses. Maine to  Minnesota and southward to Alabama.    =5. Blue Ash= (_Fraxinus quadrangulata_). Small to medium-sized tree.  Heartwood yellow, streaked with brown, sapwood a lighter color. Wood  heavy, hard, and coarse-grained. Not common. Indiana and Illinois;  occurs from Michigan to Minnesota and southward to Alabama.    =6. Green Ash= (_Fraxinus viridis_). Small-sized tree. Occurs from New  York to the Rocky Mountains, and southward to Florida and Arizona.    =7. Oregon Ash= (_Fraxinus Oregana_). Small to medium-sized tree. Occurs  from western Washington to California.    =8. Carolina Ash= (_Fraxinus Caroliniana_). Medium-sized tree. Occurs in  the Carolinas and the coast regions southward.                                ASPEN (See Poplar)                                     BASSWOOD    =9. Basswood= (_Tilia Americana_) (Linden, Lime Tree, American Linden,  Lin, Bee Tree). Medium- to large-sized tree. Wood light, soft, stiff,  but not strong, of fine texture, straight and close-grained, and white  to light brown color, but not durable in contact with the soil. The  wood shrinks considerably in drying, works well and stands well in  interior work. It is used for cooperage, in carpentry, in the  manufacture of furniture and woodenware (both turned and carved), for  toys, also for panelling of car and carriage bodies, for agricultural  implements, automobiles, sides and backs of drawers, cigar boxes,  excelsior, refrigerators, trunks, and paper pulp. It is also largely  cut for veneer and used as \"three-ply\" for boxes and chair seats. It  is used for sounding boards in pianos and organs. If well seasoned and  painted it stands fairly well for outside work. Common in all northern  broad-leaved forests. Found throughout the eastern United States, but  reaches its greatest size in the Valley of the Ohio, becoming often  130 feet in height, but its usual height is about 70 feet.    =10. White Basswood= (_Tilia heterophylla_) (Whitewood). A small-sized  tree. Wood in its quality and uses similar to the preceding, only it  is lighter in color. Most abundant in the Alleghany region.    =11. White Basswood= (_Tilia pubescens_) (Downy Linden, Small-leaved  Basswood). Small-sized tree. Wood in its quality and uses similar to  _Tilia Americana_. This is a Southern species which makes it way as  far north as Long Island. Is found at its best in South Carolina.                                       BEECH    =12. Beech= (_Fagus ferruginea_) (Red Beech, White Beech). Medium-sized  tree, common, sometimes forming forests of pure growth. Wood heavy,  hard, stiff, strong, of rather coarse texture, white to light brown  color, not durable in contact with the soil, and subject to the  inroads of boring insects. Rather close-grained, conspicuous medullary  rays, and when quarter-sawn and well smoothed is very beautiful. The  wood shrinks and checks considerably in drying, works well and stands  well, and takes a fine polish. Beech is comparatively free from  objectionable taste, and finds a place in the manufacture of  commodities which come in contact with foodstuffs, such as lard tubs,  butter boxes and pails, and the beaters of ice cream freezers; for the  latter the persistent hardness of the wood when subjected to attrition  and abrasion, while wet gives it peculiar fitness. It is an excellent  material for churns. Sugar hogsheads are made of beech, partly because  it is a tasteless wood and partly because it has great strength. A  large class of woodenware, including veneer plates, dishes, boxes,  paddles, scoops, spoons, and beaters, which belong to the kitchen and  pantry, are made of this species of wood. Beech picnic plates are made  by the million, a single machine turning out 75,000 a day. The wood  has a long list of miscellaneous uses and enters in a great variety of  commodities. In every region where it grows in commercial quantities  it is made into boxes, baskets, and crating. Beech baskets are chiefly  employed in shipping fruit, berries, and vegetables. In Maine thin  veneer of beech is made specially for the Sicily orange and lemon  trade. This is shipped in bulk and the boxes are made abroad. Beech is  also an important handle wood, although not in the same class with  hickory. It is not selected because of toughness and resiliency, as  hickory is, and generally goes into plane, handsaw, pail, chisel, and  flatiron handles. Recent statistics show that in the production of  slack cooperage staves, only two woods, red gum and pine, stood above  beech in quantity, while for heading, pine alone exceeded it. It is  also used in turnery, for shoe lasts, butcher blocks, ladder rounds,  etc. Abroad it is very extensively used by the carpenter, millwright,  and wagon maker, in turnery and wood carving. Most abundant in the  Ohio and Mississippi basin, but found from Maine to Wisconsin and  southward to Florida.                                       BIRCH    =13. Cherry Birch= (_Betula lenta_) (Black Birch, Sweet Birch, Mahogany  Birch, Wintergreen Birch). Medium-sized tree, very common. Wood of  beautiful reddish or yellowish brown, and much of it nicely figured,  of compact structure, is straight in grain, heavy, hard, strong, takes  a fine polish, and considerably used as imitation of mahogany. The  wood shrinks considerably in drying, works well and stands well, but  is not durable in contact with the soil. The medullary rays in birch  are very fine and close and not easily seen. The sweet birch is very  handsome, with satiny luster, equalling cherry, and is too costly a  wood to be profitably used for ordinary purposes, but there are both  high and low grades of birch, the latter consisting chiefly of sapwood  and pieces too knotty for first class commodities. This cheap material  swells the supply of box lumber, and a little of it is found wherever  birch passes through sawmills. The frequent objections against sweet  birch as box lumber and crating material are that it is hard to nail  and is inclined to split. It is also used for veneer picnic plates and  butter dishes, although it is not as popular for this class of  commodity as are yellow and paper birch, maple and beech. The best  grades are largely used for furniture and cabinet work, and also for  interior finish. Maine to Michigan and to Tennessee.    =14. White Birch= (_Betula populifolia_) (Gray Birch, Old Field Birch,  Aspen-leaved Birch). Small to medium-sized tree, least common of all  the birches. Short-lived, twenty to thirty feet high, grows very  rapidly. Heartwood light brown, sapwood lighter color. Wood light,  soft, close-grained, not strong, checks badly in drying, decays  quickly, not durable in contact with the soil, takes a good polish.

Here it is:    \"Don Quixote is imbued with devotion towards his ideal, for which he is  ready to suffer all possible privations, to sacrifice his life; life  itself he values only so far as it can serve for the incarnation of the  ideal, for the promotion of truth, of justice on earth.... He lives for  his brothers, for opposing the forces hostile to mankind: the witches,  the giants--that is, the oppressors.... Therefore he is fearless,  patient; he is satisfied with the most modest food, the poorest cloth:  he has other things to think of. Humble in his heart, he is great and  daring in his mind.... And who is Hamlet? Analysis, first of all, and  egotism, and therefore no faith. He lives entirely for himself, he is  an egotist; but to believe in one' self--even an egotist cannot do that:  we can believe only in something which is outside us and above us.... As  he has doubts of everything, Hamlet evidently does not spare himself;  his intellect is too developed to remain satisfied with what he finds in  himself; he feels his weakness, but each self-consciousness is a force  where-from results his irony, the opposite of the enthusiasm of Don  Quixote.... Don Quixote, a poor man, almost a beggar, without means and  relations, old, isolated--undertakes to redress all the evils and to  protect oppressed strangers over the whole world. What does it matter to  him that his first attempt at freeing the innocent from his oppressor  falls twice as heavy upon the head of the innocent himself?... What does  it matter that, thinking that he has to deal with noxious giants, Don  Quixote attacks useful windmills?... Nothing of the sort can ever happen  with Hamlet: how could he, with his perspicacious, refined, sceptical  mind, ever commit such a mistake! No, he will not fight with windmills,  he does not believe in giants ... but he would not have attacked them  even if they did exist.... And he does not believe in evil. Evil and  deceit are his inveterate enemies. His scepticism is not  indifferentism.... But in negation, as in fire, there is a destructive  power, and how to keep it in bounds, how to tell it where to stop, when  that which it must destroy, and that which it must spare are often  inseparably welded together? Here it is that the often-noticed tragical  aspect of human life comes in: for action we require will, and for  action we require thought; but thought and will have parted from each  other, and separate every day more and more....           \"And thus the native hue of resolution       Is sickled o'er by the pale cast of thought....\"      [Illustration]          ON THE BANKS OF ACHERON    By EDWIN BJORKMAN      The air was still and full of a gray melancholy light, yet the waters of  the river boiled angrily as if touched by a raging tempest. The billows  rose foaming above its surface, all white with the whiteness of fear.  When they sank back again, they were black--black as despair that knows  of no hope.    Steep hills mounted abruptly on either side of the river until they  touched the sullen, colorless cloud-banks overhead. Their sides were  seamed with numberless paths, running on narrow ledges, one above the  other, from the river's edge to the crest of the hill. Men were moving  along those paths: they swarmed like ants across the hillside, but I  could not see whence they were coming nor whither they were going. All  were pushing and jostling and scratching and howling and fighting. Every  one's object seemed to be to raise himself to the path above his own and  to prevent all others from doing the same.    Down at the water's edge, they moved in a solid mass, arms pinned down,  shoulder to shoulder and chest to back. At times a man got an arm out of  the press and began to claw the up-turned, tear-stained faces of his  neighbors in wild endeavors to lift his whole body. But soon his madness  subsided, the writhing arm sank back, and the man vanished out of sight.  The mass once more moved stolidly, solidly onward. Once in a great while  its surface of heads would begin to boil like the waters of the river  near by, and a man would be spouted into the air, landing on one of the  paths above. Then each face would be turned toward him for a breathless  moment, at the end of which the mass glided slowly onward as before.    The crush on the paths higher up on the hillside was not so great, but  the fighting of man against man was incessant and bitter. I could see  them clambering up the steep sides of the ledges, with bleeding nails,  distorted features and locked teeth. Waving arms and clutching fingers  pursued them from below; ironshod heels trampled them from above.  Ninety-nine out of the hundred ended their struggles with a fall, and in  their rapid descent they swept others with them. But rising or falling,  they all pushed onward, onward--from nowhere to nowhere, as it seemed to  me. I watched them for hours, for days, for years--always the same  wandering, the same scrambling, the same tumbling, without apparent  purpose or result. Then my blood rose hotly to my heart and head. A  scarlet mist floated before my eyes and my soul swelled within me almost  unto bursting.    \"Why?\" I cried, and the word rolled back and forth between the hillsides  until its last echo was swallowed by the murmur that hovered over the  wrathful river. The strugglers on the hillside paths, each and all,  turned toward me. On every face I read astonishment.    \"Why?\" I yelled at them again, and the sound of my voice lingered above  the waters like a distant thunder. Gradually the expression on all those  staring faces changed from wonder to scorn. A man on one of the paths  near the crest of the hill laughed aloud. Two more joined him. It became  contagious and spread like wildfire. All those millions were laughing  into my face, laughing like demons rather than men.    My frown only increased the mirth of that grinning multitude. I shook my  clenched, up-stretched fists against them. And when at last their  ghastly merriment ceased, I raised my voice once more in defiance.    \"Why?\"    As when on a bleak winter day the black snow clouds suddenly begin to  darken the sky, so hatred and rage spread over their faces. Crooked,  bony fingers were pointed at me. Men leaned recklessly from their narrow  ledges to shout abuse at me. Stones and mud were flung at me. A hundred  arms seized me and tossed my body in a wide curve from the hillside out  over the river. For one long minute I struggled to keep myself above the  yawning waters. Then I sank. All grew dark about me. A strange fullness  in my chest seemed to rise up toward my head. There was a last moment  of consciousness in which I heard a single word uttered by a ringing,  bell-like voice that came from within myself. That last word was:    \"Why?\"    [Illustration]          The British Elections and the Labor Parties    By H. KELLY      \"We are a left-center country; we live by compromise.\"    The above statement was made by an aged member of Parliament to  Kropotkin some years ago, and the present elections testify strongly to  the truth of that remark. For a country which produced the father of  political economy, Adam Smith--for Scotland is included in our  generalization--Robert Owen, the father of libertarian Socialism, which  in the forties stood almost at the head of the Socialist movement in  Europe, which has been the scene of so many Socialist and workingmen's  congresses and has furnished a refuge for so many distinguished exiles,  it is passing strange, to say the least, that up to the present no one  has been elected to Parliament on a purely Socialist platform; this  notwithstanding that, in the elections just past, of forty-three labor  members elected nineteen are members of the Independent Labor Party and  one of the Social Democratic Federation. John Burns was elected to  Parliament just after the great Dock Strike on his trade-union record  and has been elected regularly ever since, although he has long since  ceased to be a Socialist. Keir Hardie was elected for West Ham as a  Radical, and when he stood for re-election as a Socialist was defeated.  In 1900 he was elected again as member for Merthyr Tydfill, a radical  mining district in Wales, on a trade union-Socialist platform, and  undoubtedly received a large number of votes on the ground of having  been a miner once himself. R. B. Cunningham-Graham, probably the ablest  Socialist who has yet sat in the British Parliament, was elected as a  Radical, announcing himself a Socialist some time after his election.    The British workman, true to his traditions, has consistently demanded  compromise before electing anyone, and where that has been refused, the  candidates have gone down to defeat. Hyndman, founder of the Social  Democratic Federation and the ablest Socialist in public life; Quelch,  editor of \"Justice,\" the official organ of that party, for more than a  decade, and Geo. Lansbury, one of their oldest, ablest and most  respected members, refused to compromise in the recent election, and  paid the inevitable penalty. Hyndman's case was really remarkable, he is  a man of exceptional ability, has devoted himself for twenty-five years  to the Socialist and labor movement, was endorsed by all the labor  bodies of Burnley, and Mr. Phillip Stanhope, recently created a lord and  one of the ablest Liberal politicians in the country, did him the honor  of declining to stand against him. Still he was defeated--while  politicians of an inferior stamp like John Burns, Keir Hardie, J. R.  MacDonald and two score of others were triumphantly elected on a labor  platform. Therein lies the secret, they were elected on a \"Labor  Platform!\" Eight-hour day, trade-union rate of wages, better factory  legislation, secular education, annual sessions of Parliament, paid  members, one man, one vote, etc. All excellent things in themselves, but  not"]]]
