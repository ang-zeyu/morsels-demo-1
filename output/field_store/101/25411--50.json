Cellulose is  insoluble in all menstrua, but, when boiled for a long time with  sulphuric acid, is converted into a substance called dextrine. Cellulose  consists of--               From pith of Elder-tree.  Spongioles of roots.    Carbon              43.37                43.00  Hydrogen             6.04                 6.18  Oxygen              50.59                50.82                    -------              -------                     100.00               100.00    It is represented chemically by the formula, C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}, which  shows it to be a compound of 24 atoms of carbon with 21 of hydrogen and  21 of oxygen.    _Incrusting matter._--Large quantities of this substance enter into the  composition of all plants. Of its chemical nature little is known, as it  cannot be obtained separate from cellulose, but it is analogous to that  substance in its composition, and probably contains hydrogen and oxygen  in the proportion to form water.    _Starch._--Starch is one of the most abundant constituents of plants,  and is found in most seeds, as those of the cereals and the leguminous  plants; in the tubers of the potatoe, the bulbs of tulips, &c. &c. It is  obtained by placing a quantity of wheat flour in a bag, and kneading it  under a gentle stream of water. When the water is allowed to stand, it  deposits the starch as a fine white powder, which, when examined by the  microscope, is found to be composed of minute grains, formed of  concentric layers deposited on one another. These grains vary  considerably in size and structure in different plants; but in the same  plant they are generally so much alike as to admit of their recognition  by a practised observer. They were formerly believed to be composed of  an external coating of a substance insoluble in water, and containing in  their interior a soluble kernel; but this opinion has been refuted, and  distinct evidence been brought to show that the exterior and interior of  the globules are identical in chemical properties. Starch is insoluble  in cold water, but by boiling, it dissolves, forming a thick paste. By  long continued boiling with water containing a small quantity of acid,  it is completely dissolved and converted into dextrine, and eventually  into sugar. The same change is produced by the action of fermenting  substances, such as the extract of malt; when heated in the dry state to  a temperature of about 390 Fahr., it becomes soluble in cold water. It  is distinguished by giving a brilliant blue compound with iodine. Starch  contains--         Carbon    44.47       Hydrogen   6.28       Oxygen    49.25                ------                100.00    and its composition is represented by the formula C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}, so  that it differs but little from cellulose in composition, although its  chemical functions in the plant are extremely different. It is connected  with some of the most important changes which occur in the growing  plants, and by a series of remarkable transformations is converted into  sugar and other important compounds.    _Lichen Starch_ is found in most species of lichens, and is  distinguished from common starch by producing a green colour with  iodine. Its composition is the same as that of ordinary starch.    _Inuline._--The species of starch to which this name is given is  characterised by its dissolving in boiling water, and giving a white  pulverulent deposit in cooling. It is found in the tuber of the dahlia,  in the dandelion, and some other plants. Its composition is identical  with that of cellulose, and its formula is C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}.    _Gum_ is excreted from various plants as a thick fluid, which dries up  into transparent masses. Its composition is identical with that of  starch. It dissolves readily in cold water, and is converted into sugar  by long continued boiling with acids. Its properties are best marked in  gum arabic, which is obtained from various species of acacia; that from  other plants differs to some extent, although its chemical composition  is the same.    _Dextrine._--When starch is exposed to a heat of about 400 deg., or when  treated with sulphuric acid, or with a substance extracted from malt  called _diastase_, it is converted into dextrine. It may also be  obtained from cellulose by a similar treatment. The dextrine so obtained  has the same composition as the starch from which it is produced, but  its properties more nearly resemble those of gum. It plays a very  important part in the process of germination, and may be converted into  sugar on the one hand, and apparently also into starch on the other.    _Sugar._--Under this name are included four or five distinct substances,  of which the most important are, cane sugar, grape sugar, and the  uncrystallisable sugar found in many plants.    _Cane Sugar._--This variety of sugar, as its name implies, is found most  abundantly in the sugar cane, but it occurs also in the maple,  beet-root, and various species of palms, from all of which it is  extracted on the large scale. It is extremely soluble in water, and can  be obtained in large transparent prismatic crystals, as in common  sugar-candy. It swells up, and is converted into a brown substance  called caramel, when heated, and by contact with fermenting substances,  yields alcohol and carbonic acid. It contains--         Carbon    42.22       Hydrogen   6.60       Oxygen    51.18                ------                100.00    and its chemical formula is C_{12}H_{11}O_{11}.    _Grape Sugar_ is met with in the grape, and most other fruits, as well  as in honey. It is produced artificially when starch is boiled for a  long time with sulphuric acid, or treated with a large quantity of  diastase. It is less soluble in water than cane sugar, and crystallises  in small round grains. Its composition, when dried at 284 deg., is--         Carbon    40.00       Hydrogen   6.66       Oxygen    53.34                ------                100.00    and its formula is C_{12}H_{12}O_{12}; but when crystallised it contains  two equivalents of water, and is then represented by the formula  C_{12}H_{12}O_{12} + 2H_{2}O.    The uncrystallisable sugar of plants is closely allied to grape sugar,  and, so far as at present known, has the same composition, although,  from the difficulty of obtaining it quite free from crystallised sugar,  this is still uncertain.    _Mucilage_ is the name applied to the substance existing in linseed,  and in many other seeds, and which communicates to them the property of  swelling up and becoming gelatinous when treated with water. It is found  in a state of considerable purity in gum tragacanth and some other gums.  Its composition is not known with absolute certainty, but it is either  C_{24}H_{19}O_{19}, or C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}; and in the latter case it  must be identical with starch and gum.    It will be observed that all the substances belonging to this class are  very closely related in chemical composition, some of them, as starch  and gum, though easily distinguished by their properties, being  identical in constitution, while others only differ in the quantity of  water, or of its elements which they contain. In fact, they may all be  considered as compounds of carbon and water, and their relations are,  perhaps, more distinctly seen when their formulae are written so as to  show this, as is done in the following table, in the second column of  which those containing twelve equivalents of carbon are doubled, so as  to make them comparable with cellulose:--                                                                Water.  Grape sugar,   C_{12}H_{12}O_{12}   C_{24}H_{24}O_{24}   C_{24} + 24  Cane sugar,    C_{12}H_{11}O_{11}   C_{24}H_{22}O_{22}   C_{24} + 22  Cellulose,     C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}   C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}   C_{24} + 21  Inuline,       C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}   C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}   C_{24} + 21  Starch,        C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}   C_{24}H_{20}O_{20}   C_{24} + 20  Dextrine,      C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}   C_{24}H_{20}O_{20}   C_{24} + 20  Gum,           C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}   C_{24}H_{20}O_{20}   C_{24} + 20  Mucilage,      C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}   C_{24}H_{20}O_{20}   C_{24} + 20    The relation between these substances being so close, it is not  difficult to understand how one may be converted into another by the  addition or subtraction of water. Thus, cellulose has only to absorb an  equivalent of water to become grape sugar, or to lose an equivalent in  order to be converted into starch, and we shall afterwards see that  such changes do actually occur in the plant during the process of  germination.    _Pectine and Pectic Acid._--These substances are met with in many fruits  and roots, as, for instance, in the apple, the carrot, and the turnip.  They differ from the starch group in containing more oxygen than is  required to form water along with their hydrogen; but their exact  composition is still uncertain, and they undergo numerous changes during  the ripening of the fruit.    _2d. Oily or Fatty Matters._--The oily constituents of plants form a  rather extensive group of substances all closely allied, but  distinguished by minor differences in properties and constitution. Some  of them are very widely distributed throughout the vegetable kingdom,  but others are almost peculiar to individual plants. They are all  compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and are at once distinguished  from the preceding class, by containing much less oxygen than is  required to form water with their hydrogen. The principal constituents  of the fatty matters and oils of plants are three substances, called  stearine, margarine, and oleine, the two former solids, the latter a  fluid; and they rarely, if ever, occur alone,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24951"],[0,"The War in South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#9)"],[1,"guarantees from the  Government of this State for a recognition of their rights as British  subjects.'    From the date of this direct petition from our ill-used people to their  Sovereign events moved inevitably towards one end. Sometimes the surface  was troubled and sometimes smooth, but the stream always ran swiftly and  the roar of the fall sounded ever louder in the ears.          CHAPTER III    THE NEGOTIATIONS      The British Government and the British people do not desire any direct  authority in South Africa. Their one supreme interest is that the  various States there should live in concord and prosperity, and that  there should be no need for the presence of a British redcoat within the  whole great peninsula. Our foreign critics, with their misapprehension  of the British colonial system, can never realise that whether the  four-coloured flag of the Transvaal or the Union Jack of a  self-governing colony waved over the gold mines would not make the  difference of one shilling to the revenue of Great Britain. The  Transvaal as a British province would have its own legislature, its own  revenue, its own expenditure, and its own tariff against the mother  country, as well as against the rest of the world, and Britain be none  the richer for the change. This is so obvious to a Briton that he has  ceased to insist upon it, and it is for that reason perhaps that it is  so universally misunderstood abroad. On the other hand, while she is no  gainer by the change, most of the expense of it in blood and in money  falls upon the home country. On the face of it, therefore, Great Britain  had every reason to avoid so formidable a task as the conquest of the  South African Republic. At the best she had nothing to gain, and at the  worst she had an immense deal to lose. There was no room for ambition or  aggression. It was a case of shirking or fulfilling a most arduous duty.    There could be no question of a plot for the annexation of the  Transvaal. In a free country the Government cannot move in advance of  public opinion, and public opinion is influenced by and reflected in the  newspapers. One may examine the files of the press during all the months  of negotiations and never find one reputable opinion in favour of such a  course, nor did one in society ever meet an advocate of such a measure.  But a great wrong was being done, and all that was asked was the minimum  change which would set it right, and restore equality between the white  races in Africa. 'Let Kruger only be liberal in the extension of the  franchise,' said the paper which is most representative of the sanest  British opinion, 'and he will find that the power of the republic will  become not weaker, but infinitely more secure. Let him once give the  majority of the resident males of full age the full vote, and he will  have given the republic a stability and power which nothing else can. If  he rejects all pleas of this kind, and persists in his present policy,  he may possibly stave off the evil day, and preserve his cherished  oligarchy for another few years; but the end will be the same.' The  extract reflects the tone of all the British press with the exception of  one or two papers which considered that even the persistent ill-usage of  our people, and the fact that we were peculiarly responsible for them in  this State, did not justify us in interfering in the internal affairs of  the republic. It cannot be denied that the Jameson Raid had weakened the  force of those who wished to interfere energetically on behalf of  British subjects. There was a vague but widespread feeling that perhaps  the capitalists were engineering the situation for their own ends. It is  difficult to imagine how a state of unrest and insecurity, to say  nothing of a state of war, can ever be to the advantage of capital, and  surely it is obvious that if some arch-schemer were using the grievances  of the Uitlanders for his own ends the best way to checkmate him would  be to remove those grievances. The suspicion, however, did exist among  those who like to ignore the obvious and magnify the remote, and  throughout the negotiations the hand of Great Britain was weakened, as  her adversary had doubtless calculated that it would be, by an earnest  but fussy and faddy minority.    It was in April 1899 that the British Uitlanders sent their petition  praying for protection to their native country. Since the April previous  a correspondence had been going on between Dr. Leyds, Secretary of State  for the South African Republic, and Mr. Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary,  upon the existence or non-existence of the suzerainty. On the one hand,  it was contended that the substitution of a second convention had  entirely annulled the first; on the other, that the preamble of the  first applied also to the second. If the Transvaal contention were  correct it is clear that Great Britain had been tricked and jockeyed  into such a position, since she had received no _quid pro quo_ in the  second convention, and even the most careless of Colonial Secretaries  could hardly have been expected to give away a very substantial  something for nothing. But the contention throws us back upon the  academic question of what a suzerainty is. The Transvaal admitted a  power of veto over their foreign policy, and this admission in itself,  unless they openly tore up the convention, must deprive them of the  position of a sovereign State.    But now to this debate, which had so little of urgency in it that seven  months intervened between statement and reply, there came the bitterly  vital question of the wrongs and appeal of the Uitlanders. Sir Alfred  Milner, the British Commissioner in South Africa, a man of liberal  politics who had been appointed by a Conservative Government, commanded  the respect and confidence of all parties. His record was that of an  able, clear-headed man, too just to be either guilty of or tolerant of  injustice. To him the matter was referred, and a conference was arranged  between President Kruger and him at Bloemfontein, the capital of the  Orange Free State. They met on May 31, 1899.    There were three different classes of subject which had to be discussed  at the Conference. One included all those alleged breaches of the  Convention of London which had caused so much friction between the two  Governments, and which had thrice in eighteen years brought the States  to the verge of war. Among these subjects would be the Boer annexations  of native territory, such interference with trade as the stopping of the  Drifts, the question of suzerainty, and the possibility of arbitration.  The second class of questions would deal with the grievances of the  Uitlanders, which presented a problem which had in no way been provided  for in the Conventions. The third class contained the question of the  ill-treatment of British Indians, and other causes of quarrel. Sir  Alfred Milner was faced with the alternative either to argue over each  of these questions in turn--an endless and unprofitable business--or to  put forward some one test-question which would strike at the root of the  matter and prove whether a real attempt would be made by the Boer  Government to relieve the tension. The question which he selected was  that of the franchise for the Uitlanders, for it was evident that if  they obtained not a fair share--such a request was never made--but any  appreciable share in the government of the country, they would in time  be able to relieve their own grievances and so spare the British  Government the heavy task of acting as their champions. But the  Conference was quickly wrecked upon this question. Milner contended for  a five-years' retroactive franchise, with provisions to secure adequate  representation for the mining districts. Kruger offered a seven-years'  franchise, coupled with numerous conditions which whittled down its  value very much; promised five members out of thirty-one to represent  half the male adult population; and added a provision that all  differences should be subject to arbitration by foreign powers--a  condition which is incompatible with any claim to suzerainty. This offer  dropped the term for the franchise from fourteen years to seven, but it  retained a number of conditions which might make it illusory, while  demanding in exchange a most important concession from the British  Government. The proposals of each were impossible to the other, and  early in June Sir Alfred Milner was back in Cape Town and President  Kruger in Pretoria, with nothing settled except the extreme difficulty  of a settlement.    On June 12 Sir Alfred Milner received a deputation at Cape Town and  reviewed the situation. 'The principle of equality of races was,' he  said, 'essential for South Africa. The one State where inequality  existed kept all the others in a fever. Our policy was one not of  aggression, but of singular patience, which could not, however, lapse  into indifference.' Two days later Kruger addressed the Raad. 'The other  side had not conceded one tittle, and I could not give more. God has  always stood by us. I do not want war, but I will not give more away.  Although our independence has once been taken away, God had restored  it.' He spoke with sincerity no doubt, but it is hard to hear God  invoked with such confidence for the system which encouraged the liquor  traffic to the natives, and bred the most corrupt set of officials that  the modern world has seen.    A despatch from Sir Alfred Milner, giving his views upon the situation,  made the British public recognise, as nothing else had done, how serious  the position was, and how essential it was that an earnest national  effort should be made to set it right. In it he said:    'The case for intervention is overwhelming. The only attempted answer is  that things will right themselves if left alone. But, in fact, the  policy of leaving things alone has been tried for years, and "]]]
