He also has read about expeditions into districts with strange names,  but naturally these names have meant nothing to him. I know that I read  reams of African stuff about big game shooting and about _safari_, yet  in spite of all that, I remained in the dark as to many details of such  a life. I wanted to know what kind of money or trade stuff the hunter  carried; what sort of things he had to eat each day; what he wore, and  how he got from place to place. Most writers have a way of saying: \"We  equipped our _safari_ in Nairobi and made seven marches to such and such  a place, where we ran into some excellent eland.\" All the important  small details are thus left out, and the reader remains in ignorance of  what the tent boy does, who skins the game that is killed, and what sort  of a cook stove they use.    The purpose of this chapter is to tell something about the little things  that happen on _safari_. First of all, at the risk of repeating what has  been written so often before, I will say a few words about the personnel  of a _safari_, such as the one I was with.    There were four white people in our expedition--Mr. and Mrs. Akeley, Mr.  Stephenson, and myself. Mr. Akeley's chief object was to get a group of  five elephants for the American Museum of Natural History and  incidentally secure photographic and moving picture records of animal  life. Both he and Mrs. Akeley had been in Africa before and knew the  country as thoroughly perhaps as any who has ever been there. Mr. Akeley  undoubtedly is the foremost taxidermist of the world, and his work is  famous wherever African animal life has been studied. Mr. Stephenson  went for the experience in African shooting, and I for that experience  and any other sort that might turn up.    To supply an expedition of four white people, we had one head-man, whose  duty it was to run the _safari_--that is, to get us where we wanted to  go. The success and pleasure of the _safari_ depends almost wholly upon  the head-man. If he is weak, the discipline of the camp will disappear  and all sorts of annoyances will steadily increase. If he is strong,  everything will run smoothly.    [Drawing: _The Cook--A Toto--The Head-Man_]    Our head-man was a young Somali, named Abdi. For several years he was  with Mr. McMillan of Juja farm, and he spoke English well and knew the  requirements of white men. He was strikingly handsome, efficient, and  ruled the native porters firmly and kindly. Each day we patted ourselves  on the back because of Abdi.    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce. It Is Tropical Along the Athi  River]    [Photograph: Hippos in the Tana River]    [Photograph: Our Camp Down on the Tana]    Second in the list came our four gunbearers, all Somalis, they being  considered the best gunbearers. The duty of the gunbearer is always to  be with you when you are hunting, to carry your gun, and to have it in  your hand the instant it is needed. Then there were four second  gunbearers, who came along just behind the first gunbearers. The second  men were, in our case, selected from the native porters, and were  subject to the orders of the first gunbearer. The first gunbearer  carries your field-glasses and your light, long-range rifle; the second  gunbearer carries your camera, your water bottle, and your heavy cordite  double-barreled rifle. In close quarters, as in a lion fight, the first  gunbearer crouches at your elbow, hands the big rifle to you; you fire,  and he immediately takes the rifle and places in your hands the other  rifle, ready for firing. By the time you have fired this one the first  is again ready, and in this way you always have a loaded rifle ready for  use. There frequently is no time for turning around, and so the first  gunbearer is at your elbow with the barrel of one rifle pressed against  your right leg that you may know that he is there. Sometimes they run  away, but the Somali gunbearers are the most fearless and trustworthy,  and seldom desert in time of need. The gunbearer has instructions never  to fire unless his master is disarmed and down before the charge of a  beast. When an animal is killed the gunbearers skin it and care for the  trophy. Usually when on a shooting jaunt of several hours from camp  several porters go along to carry home the game.    Third in the social scale came the askaris--armed natives in uniforms  who guard the camp at night. One or more patrol the camp all night long,  keep up the fires and scare away any marauding lion or hyena that may  approach the camp. We had four askaris, one of whom was the noisiest man  I have ever heard. He reminded me of a congressman when congress is not  in session.    [Drawing: _Gunbearer--Askari--Tent Boy--Porter_]    Then came the cook, who is always quite an important member of the  community, because much of the pleasure of the _safari_ depends upon  him. Our cook was one that the Akeleys had on their former trip. His  name was Abdullah, he had a jovial face and a beaming smile, cooked  well, and was funny to look at. He wore a slouch hat with a red band  around it, a khaki suit and heavy shoes. When on the march he carried  his shoes and when in camp he wore a blue jersey and a polka-dotted  apron which took the place of trousers. He was good-natured, which  atoned somewhat for his slowness. The suggestion may be made that he  might not have been slow, but that our appetites might have been so fast  that he seemed slow.    The cook usually picks out a likely porter to help him, or a _toto_,  which means \"little boy\" in Swahili. There are always a lot of boys who  go along, unofficially, just for the fun and the food of the trip. They  are not hired, but go as stowaways, and for the first few days out  remain much in the background. Gradually they appear more and more until  all chance of their being sent back has disappeared, and then they  become established members of the party. They carry small loads and help  brighten up the camp. Then there are the tent boys, personal servants of  the white people. Each white person has his tent boy, who takes care of  his tent, his bedding, his bath, his clothes, and all his personal  effects. A good tent boy is a great feature on _safari_, for he relieves  his master of all the little worries of life. The tent boys always wait  on the table and do the family washing. They also see that the drinking  water is boiled and filtered and that the water bottles are filled each  evening.    Last of all come the porters, of whom we had eighty. There were  Swahilis, Wakambas, Kikuyus, Masai, Minyamwezis, Lumbwas, Bagandas,  Kavirondos, and doubtless members of various other tribes. It was their  duty to carry the camp from place to place, each porter carrying sixty  pounds on his head. When they arrive at the spot selected for camp they  put up the tents, get in firewood, and carry in what game may later be  shot by the white men.    Then, lowest in the social scale, are the saises, or grooms. There is  one for each mule or horse, of which we had four. The sais is always at  hand to hold the mount and is supposed to take care of it after hours.    The foregoing members of our personally conducted party, therefore,  included:       Head-man      1     Gunbearers    4     Askaris       4     Cook          1     Tent Boys     4     Porters      80     Saises        4     \"Totos\"      20    The head-man and the four gunbearers get seventy-five rupees a month,  the askaris fifteen rupees, the cook forty rupees, the tent boys twenty  and twenty-five rupees, depending upon experience, the porters ten  rupees, and the saises twelve rupees. The _totos_ get nothing except  food and lodging, as well as experience, which may be valuable when they  grow up to be porters at ten rupees a month. A rupee is about  thirty-three cents American. We were also required by law to provide a  water bottle, blanket, and sweater for each porter, as well as uniforms  and water bottles, shoes and blankets for all the other members of the  party. We also supplied twenty tents for them.    For the first day or two on _safari_ there may be little hitches and  delays, but after a short time the work is reduced to a beautiful  system, and camp is broken or pitched in a remarkably short time. The  porters get into the habit of carrying a certain load and so there is  usually little confusion in distributing the packs.    [Photograph: At the Edge of the Athi River]    [Photograph: The Totos Are Not Fastidious]    Life and activity begin early in camp. You go to bed early and before  dawn you are awakened by the singing of countless birds of many kinds.  The air is fresh and cool, and you draw your woolen blankets a little  closer around you. The tent is closed, but through the little cracks you  can see that all is still dark. In a few moments a faint grayness steals  into the air, and off in the half darkness you hear the Somali  gunbearers chanting their morning prayers--soft, musical, and soothing.  Then there are more voices murmuring in the air and the camp slowly  awakens to life. Some one is heard chopping wood, and by that time day  breaks with a crash. All is life, and the birds are singing as though  mad with the joy of life and sunshine. A little later a shadowy figure  appears by your cot and says, \"_Chai, bwana_\" which means, \"Tea,  master.\"    You turn over and slowly sip the hot tea, while outside in the clear  morning air the sound of voices grows and grows until you know that  eighty or a hundred men are busy getting their breakfasts. The crackling  of many fires greets your ears and the pungent smell of wood fires  salutes your nostrils. You look at your watch and it is perhaps five or  half past. The air is still cold and you hasten to slip out of your cot.  It is never considered wise to bathe in the morning here.    Your shoes or boots are by your bed, all oiled and cleaned, and your  puttees"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#9)"],[1," cultured voice faltered as he  spoke; and now, without apparent reason, he moved a step to the  right and glanced oddly along the room.  I followed the direction  of his glance, and saw a tall man in conventional morning dress,  irreproachable in every detail, whose head was instantly bent upon  his catalogue.  But before his eyes fell I knew that their long  almond shape, as well as the peculiar burnt pallor of his  countenance, were undoubtedly those of an Oriental.    \"There have been mysterious outrages committed, I believe, upon  many of those who have come in contact with the slipper?\" asked one  of the savants.    \"Exactly.  Professor Deeping was undoubtedly among the victims.  His instructions were explicit that the relic should be brought here  by a Moslem, but for a long time we failed to discover any Moslem  who would undertake the task; and, as you are aware, while the  slipper remained at the Professor's house attempts were made to  steal it.\"    He ceased uneasily, and glanced at the tall Eastern figure.  It had  edged a little nearer; the head was still bowed and the fine yellow  waxen fingers of the hand from which he had removed his glove  fumbled with the catalogue's leaves.  It may well have been that  in those days I read menace in every eye, yet I felt assured that  the yellow visitor was eavesdropping--was malignantly attentive to  the conversation.    The curator spoke lower than ever now; no one beyond the circle  could possibly hear him as he proceeded--    \"We discovered an Alexandrian Greek who, for personal reasons, not  unconnected with matrimony, had turned Moslem!  He carried the  slipper here, strongly escorted, and placed it where you now see it.  No other hand has touched it.\"  (The speaker's voice was raised ever  so slightly.)  \"You will note that there is a rail around the case,  to prevent visitors from touching even the glass.\"    \"Ah,\" said Dr. Nicholson quizzically, \"And has anything untoward  happened to our Graeco-Moslem friend?\"    \"Perhaps Inspector Bristol can tell,\" replied the curator.    The straight, military figure of the well-known Scotland Yard man  was conspicuous among the group of distinguished--and mostly  round-shouldered--scholars.    \"Sorry, gentlemen,\" he said, smiling, \"but Mr. Acepulos has vanished  from his tobacco shop in Soho.  I am not apprehensive that he had  been kidnapped or anything of that kind.  I think rather that the  date of his disappearance tallies with that on which he cashed his  cheque for service rendered!  His present wife is getting most  unbeautifully fat, too.\"    \"What precautions,\" someone asked, \"are being taken to guard the  slipper?\"    \"Well,\" Mostyn answered, \"though we have only the bare word of the  late Professor Deeping that the slipper was actually worn by  Mohammed, it has certainly an enormous value according to Moslem  ideas.  There can be no doubt that a group of fanatics known as  Hashishin are in London engaged in an extraordinary endeavour to  recover it.\"    Mostyn's voice sank to an impressive whisper.  My gaze sought again  the tall Eastern visitor and was held fascinated by the baffled  straining in those velvet eyes.  But the lids fell as I looked; and  the effect was that of a fire suddenly extinguished.  I determined  to draw Bristol's attention to the man.    \"Accordingly,\" Mostyn continued, \"we have placed it in this room,  from which I fancy it would puzzle the most accomplished thief to  remove it.\"    The party, myself included, stared about the place, as he went on  to explain--    \"We have four large windows here; as you see.  The Burton Room  occupies the end of a wing; there is only one door; it communicates  with the next room, which in turn opens into the main building by  another door on the landing.  We are on the first floor; these two  east windows afford a view of the lawn before the main entrance;  those two west ones face Orpington Square; all are heavily barred  as you see.  During the day there is a man always on duty in these  two rooms.  At night that communicating door is locked.  Short of  erecting a ladder in full view either of the Square or of Great  Orchard Street, filing through four iron bars and breaking the  window and the case, I fail to see how anybody can get at the  slipper here.\"    \"If a duplicate key to the safe--\" another voice struck in; I knew  it afterward for that of Professor Rhys-Jenkyns.    \"Impossible to procure one, Professor,\" cried Mostyn, his eyes  sparkling with an almost boyish interest.  \"Mr. Cavanagh here holds  the keys of the case, under the will of the late Professor Deeping.  They are of foreign workmanship and more than a little complicated.\"    The eyes of the savants were turned now in my direction.    \"I suppose you have them in a place of safety?\" said Dr. Nicholson.    \"They are at my bankers,\" I replied.    \"Then I venture to predict,\" said the celebrated Orientalist, \"that  the slipper of the Prophet will rest here undisturbed.\"    He linked his arm into that of a brother scholar and the little  group straggled away, Mostyn accompanying them to the main entrance.    But I saw Inspector Bristol scratching his chin; he looked very much  as if he doubted the accuracy of the doctor's prediction.  He had  already had some experience of the implacable devotion of the Moslem  group to this treasure of the Faithful.    \"The real danger begins,\" I suggested to him, \"when the general public  is admitted--after to-day, is it not?\"    \"Yes.  All to-day's people are specially invited, or are using  special invitation cards,\" he replied.  \"The people who received  them often give their tickets away to those who will be likely  really to appreciate the opportunity.\"    I looked around for the tall Oriental.  He seemed to have vanished,  and for some reason I hesitated to speak of him to Bristol; for my  gaze fell upon an excessively thin, keen-faced man whose curiously  wide-open eyes met mine smilingly, whose gray suit spoke Stein-Bloch,  whose felt was a Boss raw-edge unmistakably of a kind that only  Philadelphia can produce.  At the height of the season such visitors  are not rare, but this one had an odd personality, and moreover his  keen gaze was raking the place from ceiling to floor.    Where had I met him before?  To the best of my recollection I had  never set eyes upon the man prior to that moment; and since he was  so palpably an American I had no reason for assuming him to be  associated with the Hashishin.  But I remembered--indeed, I could  never forget--how, in the recent past, I had met with an apparent  associate of the Moslems as evidently European as this curiously  alert visitor was American.  Moreover ... there was something  tauntingly familiar, yet elusive, about that gaunt face.    Was it not upon the eve of the death of Professor Deeping that the  girl with the violet eyes had first intruded her fascinating  personality into my tangled affairs?  Patently, she had then been  seeking the holy slipper, and by craft had endeavoured to bend me  to her will.  Then had I not encountered her again, meeting the  glance of her unforgettable violet eyes outside a Strand hotel?  The encounter had presaged a further attempt upon the slipper!  Certainly she acted on behalf of someone interested in it; and since  neither Bristol nor I could conceive of any one seeking to possess  the bloodstained thing except the mysterious leader of the  Hashishin--Hassan of Aleppo--as a creature of that awful fanatic  being I had written her down.    Why, then, if the mysterious Eastern employed a European girl,  should he not also employ an American man?  It might well be that  the relic, in entering the doors of the impregnable Antiquarian  Museum, had passed where the diabolical arts of the Hashishin had  no power to reach it--where the beauty of Western women and the  craft of Eastern man were equally useless weapons.  Perhaps Hassan's  campaign was entering upon a new phase.    Was it a shirking of plain duty on my part that wish--that  ever-present hope--that the murderous company of fanatics who had  pursued the stolen slipper from its ancient resting-place to London,  should succeed in recovering it?  I leave you to judge.    The crescent of Islam fades to-day and grows pale, but there are yet  fierce Believers, alust for the blood of the infidel.  In such as  these a faith dies the death of an adder, and is more venomous in  its death-throes than in the full pulse of life.  The ghastly  indiscretion of Professor Deeping, in rifling a Moslem Sacristy, had  led to the mutilation of many who, unwittingly, had touched the  looted relic, had brought about his own end, had established a league  of fantastic assassins in the heart of the metropolis.    Only once had I seen the venerable Hassan of Aleppo--a stately,  gentle old man; but I knew that the velvet eyes could blaze into a  passionate fury that seemed to scorch whom it fell upon.  I knew  that the saintly Hassan was Sheikh of the Hashishin.  And  familiarity with that dreadful organization had by no means bred  contempt.  I was the holder of the key, and my fear of the fanatics  grew like a magic mango, darkened the sunlight of each day, and  filled the night with indefinable dread.    You, who have not read poor Deeping's \"Assyrian Mythology\", cannot  picture a creature with a huge, distorted head, and a tiny, dwarfed  body--a thing inhuman, yet human--a man stunted and malformed by  the cruel arts of brother men--a thing obnoxious to life, with but  one passion, the passion to kill.  You cannot conceive of the years  of agony spent by that creature strapped to a wooden frame--in  order to prevent his growth!  You cannot conceive of his fierce  hatred of all humanity, inflamed to madness by the Eastern drug,  hashish, and directed against the enemies of Islam--the holders of  the slipper--by the wonderful power of Hassan of Aleppo.    But I had not only read of such beings, I had"]]]
