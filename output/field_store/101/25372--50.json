Oh,  here's Honor! Do you know, Paddy, you have got notice to quit?--in  fact, you're going to be evicted from No. 13.\"    Honor had already been informed of the fact by the house-mistress  herself. She appeared to take the news with the utmost sangfroid.    \"I don't care in the least which room I have,\" she replied. \"All I  bargain for is a room-mate who doesn't use 'cold pig' in the mornings.  I haven't forgotten your wet sponge.\"    \"You ungrateful Paddy! It was for your good.\"    \"If you call me Paddy I shall call you Salad!\"    \"You can if you like. It's rather a pretty name, and has a juicy,  succulent sound about it.\"    \"Make haste, Honor, and clear your drawers,\" grunted Maisie. \"Here's  Flossie Taylor coming down the passage with her arms full of  under-linen.\"    No. 8, like all other bedrooms at St. Chad's, was divided by a curtain  that could be drawn at pleasure. At present, however, this was pulled  aside for the mutual convenience of the occupants of both cubicles. To  Janie the burning question to be decided was the possession of the  bookcase. She tried to imagine that it was nearer her bed than Honor's,  but justice forced her to come to the conclusion that it stood exactly  in the middle, between the two. With heroic self-denial she offered her  companion the first choice of its shelves before she put away her own  little library.    \"But I haven't brought any books with me,\" declared Honor. \"You're  welcome to the bookcase, so far as I'm concerned. We can take turns at  this luxury,\" sinking into the basket-chair.    \"Don't you ever read?\"    \"Very seldom.\"    Janie went on arranging her volumes in silence, the poets on the top  shelf, by the side of her edition of Scott's novels, and the  miscellaneous authors below. She touched each book tenderly, as though  it were an old and dear friend, opening one occasionally to glance at a  favourite passage; and she became so absorbed in her occupation that  she utterly forgot Honor's presence.    \"There! I've stowed away all my possessions,\" remarked the latter at  last. \"I don't know whether Miss Maitland judges a room by a tidy  bookcase. She said she was coming up presently, to see if we had put  our things straight.\"    Janie started guiltily. She, who was expected to be the mentor and to  keep her companion up to the mark, was certainly the defaulter in this  instance. Her bed and the chairs were strewn with various articles, and  nothing seemed as yet in its right place.    \"I couldn't help dipping into that book,\" she confessed. \"It's a  collection of old Irish fairy tales and legends. It was given me  yesterday, before I left home, and I've scarcely had time even to look  at it.\"    \"Are they nice?\"    \"Lovely, to judge by the one I've just sampled!\"    \"Then do tell it to me! I hate reading, but I'm an absolute baby for  loving to be told old tales.\"    \"I? Oh, I couldn't!\" exclaimed Janie.    \"Yes, you can--while I'm helping you to put all these things into your  drawers. Do, mavourneen! I want to hear the Irish story.\"    When Honor's grey eyes looked pleadingly from under their long, dark  lashes, and a soft blarney crept into her voice, there were few people  who could resist her. Janie flushed pink; she was so seldom asked to do  anything for anybody! She had no natural gift for narrative, but she  made an effort.    \"There was once an Irishman called Murtagh O'Neil,\" she began, \"and he  was walking over London Bridge, with a hazel staff in his hand, when an  Englishman met him and told him that the stick he carried grew on a  spot under which were hidden great treasures. The Englishman was a  wizard, and he promised that if Murtagh would go with him to Ireland,  and show him the place, he would gain as much gold as he could carry.  Murtagh consented, so they went over to Bronbhearg, in Kerry, where  there was a big green mound; and there they dug up the hazel tree on  which the staff had grown. Under it they found a broad, flat stone, and  this covered the entrance to a cavern where thousands of warriors lay  in a circle, sleeping beside their shields, with their swords clasped  in their hands. Their arms were so brightly polished that they  illuminated the whole cave; and one of them had a shield that outshone  the rest, and a crown of gold on his head. In the centre of the cave  hung a bell, which the wizard told Murtagh to beware of touching; but,  if at any time he did so, and one of the warriors were to ask: 'Is it  day?' he was to answer without hesitation: 'No, sleep thou on!' The two  men took as much as they could carry from a heap of gold pieces that  lay amidst the warriors, and Murtagh managed accidentally to touch the  bell. It rang, and one of the warriors immediately asked: 'Is it day?'  when Murtagh answered promptly: 'No, sleep thou on!' The wizard told  him that the company he had seen were King Brien Borombe and his  knights, who lay asleep ready for the dawn of a new day. When the right  time should come the bell would ring loudly, and the warriors would  start up and destroy the enemies of Erin, and once more the descendants  of the Tuatha di Danan should rule the isle in peace. When Murtagh's  treasure was all finished, he went back to the cave and helped himself  to more. On his way out he touched the bell, and again it rang; but  this time he was not so ready with his answer, and some of the warriors  rose up, took the gold from him, beat him, and flung him out of the  cave. He never recovered from the beating, but was a cripple to the end  of his days.\"    \"And serve him right, too!\" declared Honor. \"Brien Borombe was a great  hero of Ireland.\"    \"Yes, there's one of Moore's _Irish Melodies_ that begins: 'Remember the  glories of Brien the brave',\" said Janie.    \"Are there any more stories about him in that book?\"    \"I'm not sure, but there are tales about fairy raths and changelings  and leprechauns and pookas and banshees, and all kinds of extraordinary  creatures.\"    \"Then we'll have one every day, please! I think you're a first-rate  story-teller. You're almost as good as old Mary O'Grady. I've often sat  by her peat fire and heard about the banshee and the leprechaun; only,  she believes in them. I'm so glad I've moved into this bedroom! I like  you far better than those girls in No. 13.\"    When Miss Maitland came upstairs to inspect No. 8, she found Honor and  Janie already on a more favourable footing than she had dared to hope,  the latter chatting with a vivacity that no one at St. Chad's had  hitherto imagined she possessed. Once she had broken the ice of her  shyness, and had broached her beloved topic of books, Janie had plenty  to say; and, as Honor was also in a communicative mood, the pair seemed  well started on the high road to friendship.    It was fortunate for Honor that she had found a congenial room-mate, as  her first days at Chessington proved rather a time of trial. She was  woefully and terribly home-sick. It seemed an absolute uprooting to  have been torn away from Kerry, and she considered that nothing in her  new surroundings could make amends for the change. Her pride upheld her  sufficiently to prevent her from showing any outward signs of misery  before the inquisitive eyes of her schoolfellows, but every now and  then the yearning for Kilmore would rise with an almost unbearable  pain, and she would have to fight hard to keep her self-control. Maisie  Talbot, she was sure, would regard home-sickness as \"early Victorian\",  and consequently worthy of contempt; and she was determined not to give  either Maisie or any of the others an opportunity of laughing at her.    She felt very keenly the confinement and restraint of school life. To  be obliged to study lessons and play games at specified hours, all  within a certain limited area, seemed an utter contrast to the freedom  in which she had hitherto revelled; and she would long for a scamper  with Bute and Barney, her two terriers, or a sail with her father down  the creek and out into the Atlantic. She would pour enthusiastic  descriptions of her home into Janie's ears, until the latter felt she  knew Kilmore Castle and its demesne, and the little fishing village,  with its peat smoke and its warm-hearted peasants; and the rocks and  the moors and the stream, and the green, treacherous bogs, almost as  well as Honor herself.    Notwithstanding her former reputation for unsociability, Janie, at the  end of three days, had completely lost her heart to this wayward,  impulsive daughter of Erin. It was true, Honor was apt to be trying at  times. Her gusts of hot temper, petulance, or utter unreasonableness  were rather disconcerting to anyone unaccustomed to the Celtic  disposition; but they never lasted long, and Janie soon found out that  her friend rarely meant what she then said, and was generally  particularly lovable after an outburst, with a winsome look on her face  and a beguiling, endearing tone in her voice that would have gained  forgiveness from a stone.    With the rest of the members of St. Chad's Honor was also on good  terms. She could be very amusing and full of racy Irish humour when she  liked, and would send the girls into fits of laughter with her quaint  sayings and funny stories. Her nickname of \"Paddy Pepper-box\" stuck to  her, and she certainly justified it occasionally.    \"She's like a volcano,\" declared Lettice Talbot. \"Sometimes if you  tease her she starts with a bang, and lets off steam for five minutes.  Then it's all over, and she's quite pleasant again, until next time.\"    \"I'd rather have that than sulking, at any rate,\" said Dorothy  Arkwright. \"A storm often clears the air.\"    \"It's not much use chaffing her, either,\" said Madge Summers, \"for she  always seems to get the best of it.\"    \"Yes; if she's down one minute she'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24062"],[0,"A History of the United States (#9)"],[1,"than that of his ceremoniously returning  the salute of an aged Negro and saying to a friend who was disposed to  deride his actions: \"Would you have me let a poor ignorant coloured man  say that he had better manners than I?\" For the rest the traditional  eulogy of his public character is not undeserved. It may justly be said  of him, as it can be said of few of the great men who have moulded the  destinies of nations, that history can put its fingers on no act of his  and say: \"Here this man was preferring his own interest to his  country's.\"    As a military commander Washington ranks high. He had not, indeed, the  genius of a Marlborough or a Napoleon. Rather he owed his success to a  thorough grasp of his profession combined with just that remarkably  level and unbiassed judgment which distinguished his conduct of civil  affairs. He understood very clearly the conditions of the war in which  he was to engage. He knew that Great Britain, as soon as she really woke  up to the seriousness of her peril, would send out a formidable force of  well-disciplined professional soldiers, and that at the hands of such a  force no mere levy of enthusiastic volunteers could expect anything but  defeat. The breathing space which the incredible supineness of the  British Government allowed him enabled him to form something like a real  army. Throughout the campaigns that followed his primary object was not  to win victories, but to keep that army in being. So long as it existed,  he knew that it could be continually reinforced by the enthusiasm of the  colonials, and that the recruits so obtained could be consolidated into  and imbued with the spirit of a disciplined body. The moment it ceased  to exist Great Britain would have to deal simply with rebellious  populations, and Washington was soldier enough to know that an army can  always in time break up and keep down a mere population, however eager  and courageous.    And now England at last did what, if she were determined to enforce her  will upon the colonists, she ought to have done at least five years  before. She sent out an army on a scale at least reasonably adequate to  the business for which it was designed. It consisted partly of excellent  British troops and partly of those mercenaries whom the smaller German  princes let out for hire to those who chose to employ them. It was  commanded by Lord Howe. The objective of the new invasion--for the  procrastination of the British Government had allowed the war to assume  that character--was the city of New York.    New York harbour possesses, as anyone who enters it can see, excellent  natural defences. Manhattan Island, upon which the city is built, lies  at the mouth of the Hudson between two arms of that river. At the  estuary are a number of small islets well suited for the emplacement of  powerful guns. The southern bank runs northward into a sharp promontory,  at the end of which now stands the most formidable of American  fortresses. The northern approach is covered by Long Island. The British  command decided on the reduction of Long Island as a preliminary to an  assault upon the city. The island is long and narrow, and a ridge of  high ground runs down it like a backbone. This ridge Washington's army  sought to hold against the attack of the British forces. It was the  first real battle of the war, and it resulted in a defeat so  overwhelming that it might well have decided the fate of America had not  Washington, as soon as he saw how the day was going, bent all his  energies to the tough task of saving his army. It narrowly escaped  complete destruction, but ultimately a great part succeeded, though with  great loss and not a little demoralization, in reaching Brooklyn in  safety.    The Americans still held New York, the right bank of the Hudson; but  their flank was dangerously threatened, and Washington, true to his  policy, preferred the damaging loss of New York to the risk of his army.  He retired inland, again offered battle, was again defeated and forced  back into Pennsylvania. So decided did the superiority of the British  army prove to be that eventually Philadelphia itself, then the capital  of the Confederacy, had to be abandoned.    Meanwhile another British army under the command of General Burgoyne  held Canada. That province had shown no disposition to join in the  revolt; an early attempt on the part of the rebels to invade it had been  successfully repelled. Besides English and German troops, Burgoyne had  the aid of several tribes of Indian auxiliaries, whose aid the British  Government had been at some pains to secure--a policy denounced by  Chatham in a powerful and much-quoted speech. Burgoyne was a clever and  imaginative though not a successful soldier. He conceived and suggested  to his Government a plan of campaign which was sound in strategic  principle, which might well have succeeded, and which, if it had  succeeded, would have dealt a heavy and perhaps a decisive blow to  American hopes. How far its failure is to be attributed to his own  faulty execution, how far to the blunders of the Home Government, and  how far to accidents which the best general cannot always avoid, is  still disputed. But that failure was certainly the turning-point of the  war.    Burgoyne's project was this: He proposed to advance from Canada and push  across the belt of high land which forms the northern portion of what is  now New York State, until he struck the upper Hudson. Howe was at the  same time to advance northward up the Hudson, join hands with him and  cut the rebellion in two.    It was a good plan. The cutting off and crushing of one isolated  district after another is just the fashion in which widespread  insurrectionary movements have most generally been suppressed by  military force. The Government accepted it, but, owing as it would seem  to the laziness or levity of the English Minister involved, instructions  never reached Howe until it was too late for him to give effective  support to his colleague. All, however, might have prospered had  Burgoyne been able to move more rapidly. His first stroke promised well.  The important fort of Ticonderoga was surprised and easily captured,  and the road was open for his soldiers into the highlands. But that  advance proved disastrously slow. Weeks passed before he approached the  Hudson. His supplies were running short, and when he reached Saratoga,  instead of joining hands with Howe he found himself confronted by  strongly posted American forces, greatly outnumbering his own  ill-sustained and exhausted army. Seeing no sign of the relief which he  had expected to the south--though as a fact Howe had by this time learnt  of the expedition and was hastening to his assistance--on October 6,  1777, he and his army surrendered to the American commander, General  Gates.    The effect of Burgoyne's surrender was great in America; to those whose  hopes had been dashed by the disaster of Long Island, the surrender of  New York and Washington's enforced retreat it brought not only a revival  of hope but a definite confidence in ultimate success. But that effect  was even greater in Europe. Its immediate fruit was Lord North's famous  \"olive branch\" of 1778; the decision of the British Government to accept  defeat on the original issue of the war, and to agree to a surrender of  the claim to tax the colonists on condition of their return to their  allegiance. Such a proposition made three years earlier would certainly  have produced immediate peace. Perhaps it might have produced peace even  as it was--though it is unlikely, for the declaration had filled men's  souls with a new hunger for pure democracy--if the Americans had  occupied the same isolated position which was theirs when the war began.  But it was not in London alone that Saratoga had produced its effect.  While it decided the wavering councils of the British Ministry in favour  of concessions, it also decided the wavering councils of the French  Crown in favour of intervention.    As early as 1776 a mission had been sent to Versailles to solicit on  behalf of the colonists the aid of France. Its principal member was  Benjamin Franklin, the one revolutionary leader of the first rank who  came from the Northern colonies. He had all the shrewdness and humour of  the Yankee with an enlarged intelligence and a wide knowledge of men  which made him an almost ideal negotiator in such a cause. Yet for some  time his mission hung fire. France had not forgotten her expulsion from  the North American continent twenty years before. She could not but  desire the success of the colonists and the weakening or dismemberment  of the British Empire. Moreover, French public opinion--and its power  under the Monarchy, though insufficient, was far greater than is now  generally understood--full of the new ideals which were to produce the  Revolution, was warmly in sympathy with the rebellion. But, on the other  hand, an open breach with England involved serious risks. France was  only just recovering from the effects of a great war in which she had on  the whole been worsted, and very decidedly worsted, in the colonial  field. The revolt of the English colonies might seem a tempting  opportunity for revenge; but suppose that the colonial resistance  collapsed before effective aid could arrive? Suppose the colonists  merely used the threat of French intervention to extort terms from  England and then made common cause against the foreigner? These obvious  considerations made the French statesmen hesitate. Aid was indeed given  to the colonial rebels, especially in the very valuable form of arms and  munitions, but it was given secretly and unofficially, with the satirist  Beaumarchais, clever, daring, unscrupulous and ready to push his damaged  fortunes in any fashion, as unaccredited go-between.
