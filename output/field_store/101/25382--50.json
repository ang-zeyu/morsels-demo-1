Cut each artichoke into four parts and put them to boil in salt water  for only five minutes. If left longer on the fire they become too soaked  in water and lose their taste. Remove from the water, drain them, grind  or pound and rub them through a sieve. Season the pulp so obtained with  two or three beaten eggs, two or three tablespoonfuls of =Balsamella=  (No. 54) grated cheese, salt and a taste of nutmeg, but taste the  seasoning several times to see that it is correctly dosed.    Place in a mold with brown stock or meat gravy (in that case use a mold  with a hole) and cook in double boiler.      97    FRIED MUSHROOMS    (Funghi fritti)    Choose middle-sized mushrooms, which are also of the right ripeness:  when they are too big they are too soft and if small they are too hard.    Scrape the stems, wash them carefully but do not keep in water, for then  they would lose their pleasant odor. Then cut them in rather large  slices and dip them in flour before putting in the frying pan. Olive oil  is best for frying mushrooms and the seasoning is composed exclusively  of salt and pepper to be applied when they are frying. They can also be  dipped in beaten eggs after being sprinkled with flour, but this is  superfluous.      98    STEWED MUSHROOMS    (Funghi in umido)    For a stew the mushrooms ought to be below middle-size. Clean, wash and  cut as for the preceding. Put a saucepan on the fire with olive oil, one  or two cloves of oil and some mint leaves. When the oil begins to  splutter, put the mushrooms in without dipping in flour, season with  salt and pepper and when they are half cooked pour in some tomato sauce.  Be sparing however, with the seasoning, in order that the mushrooms do  not absorb it too much and so lose some of their own delicate flavor.      99    DRIED MUSHROOMS    (Funghi secchi)    Mushrooms are an excellent condiment of various dishes and for this  reason it is well to have some always at hand. Since, however, it is  not always possible to have them fresh, the following recipe to prepare  dried mushrooms will be found useful.    First of all wait until there is a sunny day. Choose young mushrooms  middle sized or big, but not too soft. Scrape the stem, clean them well  in order to remove the earth and, without washing cut them in big  pieces. This because when dried they diminish considerably in size. Keep  these pieces exposed in the sun for two or three days, then thread them  on a string (practising a hole in them) and keep in a well ventilated  room or in the sun until they become quite dry. Then put them away well  closed in a paper bag, but don't fail to look at them from time to time  to see if it is necessary to expose them some more to sun and  ventilation.    To use them soften in warm water, but keep them in as little as  possible, so that they do not lose their delicate flavor. The best time  to dry the mushrooms is June or July.      100    FRIED EGG-PLANTS    (Melanzane fritte)    Egg-plant or, as they are also called, mad-apples are an excellent  vegetable which may be used as dressing or as a dish by itself. Small or  middle-sized egg-plants are to be preferred, as the big ones have  sometimes a slightly bitter taste.    Remove the skin, cut into cubes, salt and leave them in a plate for a  few hours. Then wipe them to remove the juice that they have thrown out,  dip in flour and fry in oil.      101    STEWED EGG-PLANTS    (Melanzane in umido)    Remove the skin, cut them into cubes and place on the fire with a piece  of butter. When this is all absorbed, complete the cooking with tomato  sauce (No. 12).      102    EGG-PLANTS IN THE OVEN    (Melanzane al forno)    Skin five or six egg-plants, cut them in round slices and salt them so  that they throw out the water that they contain. After a few hours dip  in flour and frying oil.    Take a fireproof vase or baking tin and place the slices in layers, with  grated cheese between each layer, abundantly seasoned with tomato sauce  (No. 12).    Beat one egg with a pinch of salt, a tablespoonful of tomato sauce, a  teaspoonful of grated cheese and two of crumbs of bread, and cover the  upper layer with this sauce. Put the vase in the oven and when the egg  is coagulated, serve hot.      103    DRESSING OF CELERY    (Sedano per contorno)    The following are three ways to prepare celery to be served as seasoning  or seasoning for meat dishes. For the first two make the pieces about  four inches long, and two inches for the third. The stalk must be  skinned, cut crosswise and left attached to the rib of the celery. Boil  it in water moderately salted not over five minutes and remove dry.    1. Put the celery to brown in butter, then complete the cooking with  brown stock (No. 13) and sprinkle with grated cheese when serving.    2. Put in saucepan a piece of butter and a hash made with ham and a  middle sized onion, chopped fine. Add two cloves and make it boil. When  the onion is browned add soup stock or hot water with bouillon cubes and  complete the cooking. Then rub everything through a sieve and put the  gravy in a plate with the celery, seasoning with pepper only, as the  salt is already in the ham and serve with the gravy.    3. Dip the celery in flour and in the paste for frying (No. 58) and fry  in fat or oil. Or else dip in flour and then in beaten egg, wrap in  bread crumbs and fry.      104    ARTICHOKES WITH SAUCE    (Carciofi in salsa)    Remove the hard leaves of the artichokes, cut the points and skin the  stalk. Divide each artichoke into four parts or six if they are big, and  put them on the fire with butter in proportion, seasoning with salt and  pepper. Shake the saucepan to turn them and when they have absorbed a  good part of the melted butter, pour in some broth to complete the  cooking. Remove them dry, and in the gravy that remains put a pinch of  chopped parsley, one or two teaspoonfuls of cheese grated fine, lemon  juice, more salt and pepper if needed, and, mixing the whole, make it  simmer for a while. Then remove the sauce from the fire and add one or  two yolks of egg, according to the quantity and put back on the fire  with more broth to make the sauce loose. Put the artichokes in the sauce  this second time to heat them and serve especially as a side-dish for  boiled meat.      105    STUFFED ARTICHOKES    (Carciofi ripieni)    Cut the stalk at the base, remove the small outside leaves and wash the  artichokes. Then cut the top and open the internal leaves so that you  can cut the bottom with a small knife and remove the hairy part if it is  there. Keep aside the small interior leaves to put them with the  stuffing. This, if to be used, for example, for six artichokes, must be  composed of the above small leaves, 1/8 lb. of ham more lean than fat,  one fourth of a small onion, just a taste of garlic, some leaves of  celery or parsley, a pinch of dry mushrooms, softened in water, a crumb  of bread and a pinch of pepper, but no salt.    First chop the ham, then grind everything together and with the hash  fill the artichokes, and put them to cook standing on their stalks in a  saucepan with some oil, salt and pepper. Some prefer to give the  artichokes a half cooking in water before stuffing it, but it is hardly  advisable, because in this way they lose part of their special flavor.      106    ARTICHOKES STUFFED WITH MEAT    (Carciofi ripieni di carne)    For six artichokes, make the following stuffing:      1/4 lb. lean veal.    Two slices of ham, more fat than lean.    The interior part of the artichokes.    One fourth of onion (small).    Some leaves of parsley.    One pinch of softened dried mushrooms.    One small crumb of bread rolled and sifted.    One pinch of grated cheese.    When the artichokes have been browned with oil alone, pour a little  water and cover with a moistened cloth kept in place by the cover. The  steam that surrounds the artichokes cooks them better.      107    PEAS WITH ONION SAUCE    (Piselli alla francese)    The following recipe is good for one of fresh peas. Take two young  onions, cut them in half, put some stems of parsley in the middle and  tie them. Then put them into the fire with a piece of butter and when  they are browned, pour over a cup of soup stock. Make it boil and when  the onions are softened rub them through a sieve together with the gravy  that you will then put on the fire with the peas and two whole hearts of  lettuce. Season with salt and pepper and let it simmer. When the peas  are half cooked add another piece of butter dipped in a scant  tablespoonful of flour and pour in some broth, if necessary. Before  sending to the table put in two yolks of eggs dissolved in a little  broth.    II    The following recipe is simpler than the preceding, but not so delicate.  Cut an onion in very thin slices and put it on the fire in a saucepan  with a little butter. When it is well browned add a pinch of flour, mix  and then add according to the quantity, a cup or two of soup stock or  water with bouillon cubes and allow the flour to cook. Put in the peas,  season with salt and pepper and add, when they are half cooked, one or  two whole hearts of lettuce. Let it simmer, seeing that the gravy is not  too thick.    Before serving remove the lettuce.      108    PEAS WITH HAM    (Piselli col prosciutto)    Cut in two one or two young onions, according to the quantity of the  peas and put them on the fire with oil and one thick slice of ham cut  into small cubes. Brown until the ham is shrivelled; then put the peas  in, season with a pinch of pepper and very little salt, mix and complete  the cooking with broth, adding a little butter.    Before serving, throw the onion away.      109    PEAS WITH CORNED BEEF    (Piselli con la carne secca)    Put on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24409"],[0,"Our Common Insects (#9)"],[1," of bees' nests, and at the very  moment that the bee lays her egg in the honey cell, the flattened, ovate  Sitaris larva drops from the body of the bee upon which it has been  living, and feasts upon the contents of the freshly laid egg. After  eating this delicate morsel it devours the honey in the cells of the bee  and changes into a white, cylindrical, nearly footless grub, and after  it is full-fed, and has assumed a supposed \"pupa\" state, the skin,  without bursting, incloses a kind of hard \"pupa\" skin, which is very  similar in outline to the former larva, within whose skin is found a  whitish larva which directly changes into the true pupa. In a succeeding  state this pupa in the ordinary way changes to a beetle which belongs to  the same group of Coleoptera as Meloe. We cannot but think, from  observations made on the humble bee, the wasp, two species of moths and  several other insects, that this \"hyper-metamorphosis\" is not so  abnormal a mode of insect metamorphosis as has been supposed, and that  the changes of these insects, made beneath the skin of the mature larva  before assuming the pupa state, are almost as remarkable as those of  Meloe and Sitaris, though less easily observed than they. Several other  beetles allied to Meloe are known to be parasitic on wild bees, though  the accounts of them are fragmentary.      THE STYLOPS PARASITE.    The history of Stylops, a beetle allied to Meloe, is no less strange  than that of Meloe, and is in some respects still more interesting. On  June 18th I captured an Andrena vicina which had been \"stylopized.\" On  looking at my capture I saw a pale reddish-brown triangular mark on the  bee's abdomen; this was the flattened head and thorax of a female  Stylops (Fig. 39_a_, position of the female of Stylops, seen in profile  in the abdomen of the bee; Fig. 39_b_, the female seen from above. The  head and thorax are soldered into a single flattened mass, the baggy  hind-body being greatly enlarged like that of the gravid female of the  white ant, and consisting of nine segments).    [Illustration: 39. Female Stylops.]    On carefully drawing out the whole body (Pl. 1, Fig. 6, as seen from  above, and showing the alimentary canal ending in a blind sac; Fig.  6_a_, side view), which is very extensible, soft and baggy, and  examining it under a high power of the microscope, we saw multitudes, at  least several hundred, of very minute larvae, like particles of dust to  the naked eye, issuing in every direction from the body of the parent  now torn open in places, though most of them made their exit through an  opening on the under side of the head-thorax. The Stylops, being hatched  while still in the body of the parent, is, therefore viviparous. She  probably never lays eggs.    On the last of April, when the Mezereon was in blossom, I caught the  singular looking male (Stylops Childreni, Fig. 40; a, side view; it is  about one-fourth of an inch long), which was as unlike its partner as  possible. I laid it under a tumbler, when the delicate insect flew and  tumbled about till it died of exhaustion in a few hours.    It appears, then, that the larvae are hatched during the middle or last  of June from eggs fertilized in April. The larvae then crawl out upon the  body of the bee, on which they are transported to the nest, where they  enter, according to Peck's observations, the body of the larva, on whose  fatty parts they feed. Previous to changing to a pupa the larva lives  with its head turned towards that of its host, but before assuming the  perfect state (which they do in the late summer or autumn) it must  reverse its position. The female protrudes the front part of her body  between the segments of the abdomen of her host, as represented in our  figure. This change, Newport thinks, takes place after the bee-host has  undergone its metamorphoses, though the bee does not leave her earthen  cells until the following spring. Though the male Stylops deserts his  host, his wingless partner is imprisoned during her whole life within  her host, and dies immediately after giving birth to her myriad (for  Newport thinks she produces over two thousand) offspring.    [Illustration: 40. Male Stylops.]    Xenos Peckii, an allied insect, was discovered by Dr. Peck to be  parasitic in the body of wasps, and there are now known to be several  species of this small but curious family, Stylopidae, which are known to  live parasitically on the bodies of our wild bees and wasps. The  presence of these parasites finally exhausts the host, so that the  sterile female bee dies prematurely.    As in the higher animals, bees are afflicted with parasitic worms which  induce disease and sometimes death. The well-known hair worm, Gordius,  is an insect parasite. The adult form is about the size of a slender  knitting needle, and is seen in moist soil and in pools. It lays,  according to Dr. Leidy, \"millions of eggs connected together in long  cords.\" The microscopical, tadpole-shaped young penetrate into the  bodies of insects frequenting damp localities. Fairly ensconced within  the body of their unsuspecting host, they luxuriate on its fatty  tissues, and pass through their metamorphoses into the adult form, when  they desert their living house and take to the water to lay their eggs.  In Europe, Siebold has described Gordius subbifurcus, which infests the  drones of the Honey bee, and also other insects. Professor Siebold has  also described Mermis albicans, which is a similar kind of hair worm,  from two to five inches long, and whitish in color. This worm is also  found, strangely enough, only in the drones, though it is the workers  which frequent watery places to appease their thirst.    [Illustration: 41. Bee fungus.]    Thousands of insects are carried off yearly by parasitic fungi. The  ravages of the Muscardine, caused by a minute fungus (Botrytris  Bassiana), have threatened the extinction of silk culture in Europe, and  the still more formidable disease called _pebrine_ is thought to be of  vegetable origin. Dr. Leidy mentions a fungus which must annually carry  off myriads of the Seventeen Year Locust. A somewhat similar fungus,  Mucor mellitophorus (Fig. 41), infests bees, filling the stomach with  microscopical colorless spores, so as greatly to weaken the insect.    As there is a probability that many insects, parasites on the wild bees,  may sooner or later afflict the Honey bee, and also to illustrate  farther the complex nature of insect parasitism, we will for a moment  look at some other bee parasites.    [Illustration: Pl. 1    PARASITES OF BEES.]    Among the numerous insects preying in some way upon the Humble bee are  to be found other species of bees and moths, flies and beetles. Insect  parasites often imitate their host: Apathus (Plate I, Fig. 1, A.  Ashtoni) can scarcely be distinguished from its host, and yet it lives  cuckoo-like in the cells of the Humble bee, though we know not yet how  injurious it really is. Then there are Conops and Volucella, the  former of which lives like Tachina and Phora within the bee's body,  while the latter devours the brood. The young (Plate I, Figs. 5, 5_a_)  of another fly allied to Anthomyia, of which the Onion fly (Fig. 42) is  an example, is also not unfrequently met with. A small beetle (Plate 1.  Fig. 4, Antherophagus ochraceus) is a common inmate of Humble bees'  nests, and probably feeds upon the wax and pollen. We have also found  several larvae (Fig. 43) of a beetle of which we do not know the adult  form. Of similar habits is probably a small moth (Nephopteryx Edmandsii,  Plate I, Figs. 2; 2_a_, larva; Fig. 2_b_, chrysalis, or pupa) which  undoubtedly feeds upon the waxen walls of the bee cells, and thus, like  the attacks of the common bee moth (Galleria cereana, whose habits are  so well known as not to detain us, must prove very prejudicial to the  well being of the colony. This moth is in turn infested by an Ichneumon  fly (Microgaster nephoptericis, Plate I, Figs. 3, 3_a_) which must prove  quite destructive.    [Illustration: 42. Onion Fly and Maggot.]    [Illustration: 43. Larva of Beetle.]    The figures of the early stages of a minute ichneumon represented on the  same plate (Fig. 7, larva, and 7_a_, pupa, of Anthophorabia megachilis)  which is parasitic on Megachile, the Leaf-cutter bee, illustrates the  transformations of the Ichneumon flies, the smallest species of which  yet known (and we believe the smallest insect known at all) is the  Pteratomus Putnami (Pl. I, Fig. 8, wanting the hind leg), or \"winged  atom,\" which is only one-ninetieth of an inch in length, and is  parasitic on Anthophorabia, itself a parasite. A species of mite (Plate  I, Figs. 9; 9_a_, the same seen from beneath) is always to be found In  humble bees' nests, but it is not thought to be specially obnoxious to  the bees themselves, though several species of mites (Gamasus, etc.) are  known to be parasitic on insects.          CHAPTER IV.    A FEW WORDS ABOUT MOTHS.      The butterflies and moths from their beauty and grace, have always been  the favorites among amateur entomologists, and rare and costly works  have been published in which their forms and gorgeous colors are  represented in the best style of natural history art. We need only  mention the folio volume of Madam Merian of the last century, Harris's  Aurelian, the works of Cramer, Stoll, Drury, Huebner, Horsfield,  Doubleday and Westwood, and Hewitson, as comprising the most luxurious  and costly entomological works.    Near the close of the last century, John Abbot went from London and  spent several years in Georgia, rearing the larger and more showy  butterflies and moths, and painting them in the larva, chrysalis and  adult, or imago stage. These drawings he sent to London to be sold. Many  of them were collected by Sir James Edward Smith, and published under  the title of \"The Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of  Georgia, collected from"]]]
