For a short time it clung motionless, gathering  strength. Then, bracing its legs firmly on the edges of the shell, it  lifted its tail quite clear, and crawled up the weed a perfect  dragon-fly, forgetful of that grim husk it was leaving behind. A few  minutes later, the good sun having dried its wings, it went darting  and hurtling over the pool, a gemlike, opalescent shining thing,  reflected gloriously in the polished mirror beneath.          The Little Wolf of the Air      The pool lay shimmering and basking in the flood of the June sun. On  three sides, east, west, and north, the willows and birches gathered  close about it, their light leafage hanging motionless in the clear,  still heat. On the south side it lay open toward the thick-grassed  meadows, where bees and flies of innumerable species flickered lazily  over the pale crimson clover-blooms. From the clover-blooms and the  vetch-blooms, the wheel-rayed daisies, and the tall umbels of the wild  parsnip, strange perfumes kept distilling in the heat and pulsing in  across the pool on breaths of air too soft to ruffle its surface.    Above this unruffled surface the air was full of dancing life. Gnats  hung in little, whirling nebulae; mosquitoes, wasplike flies, and  whirring, shard-winged beetles, passed and repassed each other in  intricate lines of flight; and, here and there, lucently flashing on  long, transparent, veined wings, darted the dragon-flies in their  gemlike mail. Their movements were so swift, powerful, and light that  it was difficult, in spite of their size and radiant colour, to detect  the business that kept the dragon-flies so incessantly and tirelessly  in action. Sometimes two or three would hurtle out for a brief  expedition over the blossoming meadow. Often one would alight for a  moment on a leaf or twig in the sun, and lie there gleaming, its two  pairs of wings flatly outspread in a way that showed every delicate  interlacing of the nerves. Then it would rise again into the air with  a bold, vehement spring; and when ever it began its flight, or  whenever it abruptly changed the direction of its flight, its wings  would make a dry, sharp, rustling sound.    The business that so occupied these winged and flashing gems, these  darting iridescences, was in truth the universal business of hunting.  But there were few indeed among all the kindred of earth, air, and  water whose hunting was so savage and so ravenous as that of these  slender and spiritlike beings. With appetites insatiable, ferocity  implacable, strength and courage prodigious for their stature, to call  them the little wolves of the air is perhaps to wrong the ravening  gray pack whose howlings strike terror down the corridors of the  winter forest. Mosquitoes and gnats they hunted every moment,  devouring them in such countless numbers as to merit the gratitude of  every creature that calls the mosquito its foe. But every summer fly,  also, was acceptable prey to these indomitable hunters, every  velvet-bodied moth, every painted butterfly. And even the envenomed  wasp, whose weapon no insect can withstand, was not safe. If the  dragon-fly could catch her engrossed in some small slaughter of her  own, and, pouncing upon her from above, grip the back of her armed  abdomen in his great grinding jaws, her sting could do nothing but  dart out vainly like a dark, licking flame; and she would prove as  good a meal as the most unresisting bluebottle or horse-fly.    Down to the pool, through the luxurious shadows of the birches, came a  man, and stretched himself against a leaning trunk by the waterside.  At his approach, all the business of life and death and mating in his  immediate neighbourhood came to a halt, and most of the winged  kindred, except the mosquitoes, drew away from him. The mosquitoes, to  whom he had become, so to speak, in a measure acclimatized, attacked  him with less enthusiasm than they would have displayed in the case of  a stranger, and failed to cause him serious annoyance. He fixed  himself in a position that was thoroughly comfortable, and then lay  quite still.    The man's face was under the shadow of the birch-tree, but his body  lay out in the full sun, and the front of his soft white summer shirt  made a patch of sharp light against the surrounding tones of brown and  green. When it had for a time remained quite still, the patch of  whiteness attracted attention, and various insects alighted upon it to  investigate. Presently the man noticed a very large steel-blue  dragon-fly on rustling wings balancing in the air a few feet in front  of him. At this moment, from a branch overhead, a hungry shrike dashed  down. The dragon-fly saw the peril just in time; and, instead of  fleeing desperately across the pool, to be almost inevitably overtaken  by the strong-winged bird, it dashed forward and perched for refuge on  a fold of the dazzling white shirt. The foiled shrike, with an angry  and astonished twitter, flew off to a tree across the pool.    For perhaps a minute the great fly stood with moveless, wide-spread  wings, scintillating aerial hues as if its body was compacted of a  million microscopic prisms. The transparent tissue of its wings was  filled with a finer and more elusive iridescence. The great rounded,  globose, overlapping jaws, half as big as the creature's whole head,  kept opening and shutting, as if to polish their edges. The other half  of its head was quite occupied by two bulging, brilliant spheres of  eyes, which seemed to hold in their transparent yet curiously  impenetrable depths a shifting light of emerald and violet. These  inscrutable and enormous eyes--each one nearly as great in  circumference as the creature's body--rolled themselves in a steady  stare at the man's face, till he felt the skin of his cheeks creep at  their sinister beauty. It seemed to him as if a spirit hostile and  evil had threatened him from beneath those shining eyes; and he was  amused to experience, for all his interest, a sense of half-relief  when the four beautiful wings hurtled crisply and the creature darted  away.    It would seem, however, that the fold of white shirt had found favour  in those mysteriously gleaming eyes; for a minute or two later the  same fly returned to the same spot. The man recognized not only its  unusual size and its splendour of colour, but a broken notch on one of  its wing films, the mark of the tip of a bird's beak. This time the  dragon-fly came not as a fugitive from fate, but as a triumphant  dispenser of fate to others. It carried between its jaws the body of  a small green grasshopper, which it had already partly eaten.    Fixing the enigmatic radiance of its eyes upon the man's face, the  dragon-fly calmly continued its meal, using the second joints of its  front pair of legs to help manipulate the rather awkward morsel. Its  great round jaws crushed their prey resistlessly, while the inner  mouth sucked up the juices so cleanly and instantaneously that the  repast left no smallest stain upon the man's spotless shirt. When the  feast was over there remained nothing of the victim but a compact,  perfectly rounded, glistening green ball, the size of a pea, made up  of the well-chewed shell-like parts of the grasshopper's body. It  reminded the man of the round \"castings\" of fur or feathers which an  owl ejects after its undiscriminating banquet. Having rolled the  little green ball several times between its jaws, to make sure there  was no particle of nourishment left therein, the dragon-fly coolly  dropped it into a crease in the shirt-bosom, and rustled away.    [Illustration: \"A LARGE FROG RISE TO THE SURFACE JUST BELOW HER.\"]    It chanced that this particular and conspicuous individual of the  little wolves of the air was a female. A half-hour later, when the man  had almost grown tired of his watching, he again caught sight of the  great fly. This time she alighted on a half-submerged log, one end  of which lay on shore by the man's feet, while the other end was  afloat in deep water, where it could rise and fall with every change  in the level of the pool. Quivering and gleaming with all her subtle  fires, the dragon-fly stood motionless on the log for a few seconds.  Then she backed down close to the water's edge, thrust her long,  slender abdomen a good inch into the water, and curled it under her as  if she were trying to sting the hidden surface of the log. In reality,  as the man at once understood, she was busy laying eggs,--eggs that  should presently develop into those masked and terrible larvae of hers,  the little wolves of the pool. She laid the eggs in a row under the  log, where there was no danger of the water receding from them. She  moved along the log daintily, step by step, and her wings fluttered  over the task.    The man had taken out his watch as soon as he saw what she was about,  in order that he might time the egg-laying process. But he was not  destined to discover what he wanted to know. The dragon-fly had been  at her business for perhaps two minutes, when the man saw a large frog  rise to the surface just below her. He liked all dragon-flies,--and  for this one in particular he had developed a personal interest.  Suddenly and violently he jumped to his feet, hoping to chase her away  from the approaching doom. But he was just too late. As he jumped, the  big frog sprang, and a long, darting, cleft tongue clutched the busy  fly, dragging her down. The frog disappeared with his prize,--to come  to the surface again at the edge of a lily-pad, a few feet off, and  blink his goggle-eyes in satisfaction. He had avenged (though about  that he cared as little as he knew) the lives of a thousand tadpoles.

[Illustration: Fig. 36.--A warp weighted loom made at Bankfield  Museum, to show the possibility of weaving by this method. There is no  heddle nor shuttle used. The weaver made the \"shed\" and pushed the  weft through with his fingers. He naturally worked _down_wards.]    [Illustration: Fig. 37.--Diagram to show how the warp is kept taut on  a Syrian loom.]    Finally, it may not be out of place here to point out that there are  other looms, besides the Greek and Scandinavian, on which the warp is  made taut by means of warp weights. The Rev. Dr. Harvey Porter, of the  American College, Beyrout, Syria, writing about the year 1901, thus  describes the common loom of the country. He says: \"Two upright posts  are fixed in the ground, which hold the roller to which the threads of  the warp are fastened, and upon which the cloth is wound as it is  woven. The threads of the warp are carried upward towards the ceiling  at the other end of the room, and pass over rollers, and are gathered  in hanks and weighted to keep them taut (_Dic. of the Bible_,  Edinburgh, 1902, IV., p. 901).\" He has kindly sent me an illustration  of this loom, but unfortunately the weights are not clearly shown, and  the same is the case with an illustration of a loom from Cyprus.[J]  The diagram, Fig. 37, shows the principle. In a Shan loom illustrated  by Mrs. Leslie Milne, in _The Shans at Home_, London, 1910, p. 120,  the warp makes a somewhat similar detour over the head of the weaver,  it is, however, not weighted but tied to a beam. The point to be  observed is that these warp-weighted looms are horizontal and not  perpendicular, and also that the weaving is the reverse of that on the  Greek loom but similar to that on our horizontal looms, so that the  present Syrian and Cyprian looms have nothing in common with the old  Greek loom.    [Illustration: Fig. 38.--Hand of Penelope clutching her shuttle. From  a corner of a piece of sculpture discovered by O. Kern and described  by C. Robert, (_The Feet Washing of Odysseus_, fifth Century B.C.,  _Mitt. Kais. Deutsch. Arch. Inst._, Athens, XXV., 1900, pp. 332-3).  The author considers Penelope to be in the act of unravelling what she  has woven: \"We see her holding the spool with her right hand, while  the left hand, half closed, is raised to about shoulder high, and the  fingers, if I read the traces correctly, are posed as though she held  a thread.\"]    The Greeks evidently used a spool in weaving, that is a piece of stick  round which was wound the thread that became the weft, as is shown in  the hand of Penelope, Fig. 38, and in Kirke's loom, Fig. 15.      FOOTNOTES:    [E] I find frequent references, by various writers, to an upright loom  mentioned by E. H. Palmer as used by a Bedawin woman near Jebel Musa,  but on looking up his description (_The Desert of the Exodus_, I. p.  125), I find it to be so indifferent as to be quite useless for  purposes of comparison.    [F] My attention to this was kindly drawn by Mr. F. N. Pryce,  Assistant in the Dept. of Greek and Roman Antiquities.    [G] The existence of warp weighted looms amongst the prehistoric Lake  Dwellers of Switzerland was first surmised by Pauer (_Keller's Lake  Dwellings_) from the discovery of the weights, and was made  practically certain by Messikommer and Jentsch.    [H] Comparing the loom Olafsson saw with the description in the Nial  Saga, he concludes this sort of loom was in use A.D. 1014, in the  North of Scotland.    [I] He criticises the detail of the illustration of Penelope's loom.  It must be remembered this illustration is not a technical drawing,  but an artist's representation where correctness of detail cannot be  expected. In his own drawing of the Egyptian horizontal loom many of  the warp threads are shown over instead of under the laze rods, and  yet this is supposed to be a correct technical drawing!    [J] Since writing Dr. Porter has sent me photograph of another sort of  loom in which weights are used as counter balances to keep the heddles  raised. The subject requires further elucidation.          III. CONCLUSION.      From the foregoing we gather that the Ancient Egyptians had two forms  of looms. The earlier or horizontal form, date about B.C. 2000, has in  a modified way survived to the present day in desert Egypt and is also  found in Seistan. It required a large area of ground for working and  probably in earlier times when there was plenty of space this did not  much matter. But as the population in the towns increased and with  the increase of civilisation and its concomitant increased demand for  cloth, probably out of proportion to the increase of population, space  would be begrudged and this may have caused the invention or the  introduction of the vertical form of loom which we find in use some  500 years later. In Egypt therefore the horizontal loom preceded the  vertical loom but it does not necessarily follow that such was the  case elsewhere. In so far as we can gather from the small amount of  information at our disposal, in the earlier days the women were the  weavers, and later on with the introduction of the upright loom the  men were the weavers with an occasional female weaver. In the Egyptian  Desert and in Seistan in the present day with horizontal looms the  weavers appear to be males, but among the nomads of Persia who  likewise use horizontal looms the weavers are females. In the use of  either form of loom the Egyptian weavers beat the weft downwards or  towards themselves and _not_ upwards or away from themselves. They had  the heddle in one of its earliest forms and had consequently made the  first great step in the evolution of the loom as we now know it. In  the beginning they made no selvedges so that for every pick a separate  length of weft thread was used. The adoption of the selvedge was  another improvement and until it was introduced the weft would no  doubt have been put through with the fingers, later on a spool being  used. It is possible also that in very late times the weavers' comb  was introduced. It is safe to say that the Egyptians had no knowledge  of the reed. Both forms of looms were simple, without harness or other  complicated pieces of mechanism. The Egyptians accomplished fairly  good work and judging these people from their looms alone we must  conclude they were a progressive race.    The Greek form of loom was an upright one on which the warp threads  were kept taut by means of weights and similar to the form which  existed in Central and Northern Europe (in the latter until recent  times) but of which so far there is no trace to the east, or south, or  west. The Greek loom may have been furnished with a heddle but the  drawings are not clear on this point. A spool was used. The weavers  were women and the weft was beaten upwards or away from the weaver. It  was not a form of loom so capable of improvement as the Egyptian forms  and there appears to be no connection between the forms used on either  side of the Mediterranean. The Greek tapestry loom could hardly have  been more primitive. In respect to the forms of looms used by the two  peoples the Egyptians were considerably in advance of the Greeks.
