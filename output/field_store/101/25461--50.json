I have spoken of Babylonian perspectives, and of words  written with a fiery finger, like that huge unhuman finger that wrote on  Belshazzar's wall.... But what did it write on Belshazzar's wall?... I  am content once more to end on a note of doubt and a rather dark  sympathy with those many-coloured solar systems turning so dizzily, far  up in the divine vacuum of the night.    'From the earth we come and to the earth we return; when people get away  from that they are lost.'          _Irish and other Interviewers_      It is often asked what should be the first thing that a man sees when he  lands in a foreign country; but I think it should be the vision of his  own country. At least when I came into New York Harbour, a sort of grey  and green cloud came between me and the towers with multitudinous  windows, white in the winter sunlight; and I saw an old brown house  standing back among the beech-trees at home, the house of only one among  many friends and neighbours, but one somehow so sunken in the very heart  of England as to be unconscious of her imperial or international  position, and out of the sound of her perilous seas. But what made most  clear the vision that revisited me was something else. Before we touched  land the men of my own guild, the journalists and reporters, had already  boarded the ship like pirates. And one of them spoke to me in an accent  that I knew; and thanked me for all I had done for Ireland. And it was  at that moment that I knew most vividly that what I wanted was to do  something for England.    Then, as it chanced, I looked across at the statue of Liberty, and saw  that the great bronze was gleaming green in the morning light. I had  made all the obvious jokes about the statue of Liberty. I found it had a  soothing effect on earnest Prohibitionists on the boat to urge, as a  point of dignity and delicacy, that it ought to be given back to the  French, a vicious race abandoned to the culture of the vine. I proposed  that the last liquors on board should be poured out in a pagan libation  before it. And then I suddenly remembered that this Liberty was still in  some sense enlightening the world, or one part of the world; was a lamp  for one sort of wanderer, a star of one sort of seafarer. To one  persecuted people at least this land had really been an asylum; even if  recent legislation (as I have said) had made them think it a lunatic  asylum. They had made it so much their home that the very colour of the  country seemed to change with the infusion; as the bronze of the great  statue took on a semblance of the wearing of the green.    It is a commonplace that the Englishman has been stupid in his relations  with the Irish; but he has been far more stupid in his relations with  the Americans on the subject of the Irish. His propaganda has been worse  than his practice; and his defence more ill-considered than the most  indefensible things that it was intended to defend. There is in this  matter a curious tangle of cross-purposes, which only a parallel example  can make at all clear. And I will note the point here, because it is  some testimony to its vivid importance that it was really the first I  had to discuss on American soil with an American citizen. In a double  sense I touched Ireland before I came to America. I will take an  imaginary instance from another controversy; in order to show how the  apology can be worse than the action. The best we can say for ourselves  is worse than the worst that we can do.    There was a time when English poets and other publicists could always be  inspired with instantaneous indignation about the persecuted Jews in  Russia. We have heard less about them since we heard more about the  persecuting Jews in Russia. I fear there are a great many middle-class  Englishmen already who wish that Trotsky had been persecuted a little  more. But even in those days Englishmen divided their minds in a curious  fashion; and unconsciously distinguished between the Jews whom they had  never seen, in Warsaw, and the Jews whom they had often seen in  Whitechapel. It seemed to be assumed that, by a curious coincidence,  Russia possessed not only the very worst Anti-Semites but the very best  Semites. A moneylender in London might be like Judas Iscariot; but a  moneylender in Moscow must be like Judas Maccabaeus.    Nevertheless there remained in our common sense an unconscious but  fundamental comprehension of the unity of Israel; a sense that some  things could be said, and some could not be said, about the Jews as a  whole. Suppose that even in those days, to say nothing of these, an  English protest against Russian Anti-Semitism had been answered by the  Russian Anti-Semites, and suppose the answer had been somewhat as  follows:--    'It is all very well for foreigners to complain of our denying civic  rights to our Jewish subjects; but we know the Jews better than they do.  They are a barbarous people, entirely primitive, and very like the  simple savages who cannot count beyond five on their fingers. It is  quite impossible to make them understand ordinary numbers, to say  nothing of simple economics. They do not realise the meaning or the  value of money. No Jew anywhere in the world can get into his stupid  head the notion of a bargain, or of exchanging one thing for another.  Their hopeless incapacity for commerce or finance would retard the  progress of our people, would prevent the spread of any sort of economic  education, would keep the whole country on a level lower than that of  the most prehistoric methods of barter. What Russia needs most is a  mercantile middle class; and it is unjust to ask us to swamp its small  beginnings in thousands of these rude tribesmen, who cannot do a sum of  simple addition, or understand the symbolic character of a threepenny  bit. We might as well be asked to give civic rights to cows and pigs as  to this unhappy, half-witted race who can no more count than the beasts  of the field. In every intellectual exercise they are hopelessly  incompetent; no Jew can play chess; no Jew can learn languages; no Jew  has ever appeared in the smallest part in any theatrical performance; no  Jew can give or take any pleasure connected with any musical instrument.  These people are our subjects; and we understand them. We accept full  responsibility for treating such troglodytes on our own terms.'    It would not be entirely convincing. It would sound a little far-fetched  and unreal. But it would sound exactly like our utterances about the  Irish, as they sound to all Americans, and rather especially to  Anti-Irish Americans. That is exactly the impression we produce on the  people of the United States when we say, as we do say in substance,  something like this: 'We mean no harm to the poor dear Irish, so dreamy,  so irresponsible, so incapable of order or organisation. If we were to  withdraw from their country they would only fight among themselves; they  have no notion of how to rule themselves. There is something charming  about their unpracticability, about their very incapacity for the coarse  business of politics. But for their own sakes it is impossible to leave  these emotional visionaries to ruin themselves in the attempt to rule  themselves. They are like children; but they are our own children, and  we understand them. We accept full responsibility for acting as their  parents and guardians.'    Now the point is not only that this view of the Irish is false, but that  it is the particular view that the Americans know to be false. While we  are saying that the Irish could not organise, the Americans are  complaining, often very bitterly, of the power of Irish organisation.  While we say that the Irishman could not rule himself, the Americans are  saying, more or less humorously, that the Irishman rules them. A highly  intelligent professor said to me in Boston, 'We have solved the Irish  problem here; we have an entirely independent Irish Government.' While  we are complaining, in an almost passionate manner, of the impotence of  mere cliques of idealists and dreamers, they are complaining, often in a  very indignant manner, of the power of great gangs of bosses and  bullies. There are a great many Americans who pity the Irish, very  naturally and very rightly, for the historic martyrdom which their  patriotism has endured. But there are a great many Americans who do not  pity the Irish in the least. They would be much more likely to pity the  English; only this particular way of talking tends rather to make them  despise the English. Thus both the friends of Ireland and the foes of  Ireland tend to be the foes of England. We make one set of enemies by  our action, and another by our apology.    It is a thing that can from time to time be found in history; a  misunderstanding that really has a moral. The English excuse would carry  much more weight if it had more sincerity and more humility. There are  a considerable number of people in the United States who could  sympathise with us, if we would say frankly that we fear the Irish.  Those who thus despise our pity might possibly even respect our fear.  The argument I have often used in other places comes back with  prodigious and redoubled force, after hearing anything of American  opinion; the argument that the only reasonable or reputable excuse for  the English is the excuse of a patriotic sense of peril; and that the  Unionist, if he must be a Unionist, should use that and no other. When  the Unionist has said that he dare not let loose against himself a  captive he has so cruelly wronged, he has said all that he has to say;  all that he has ever had to say; all that he will ever have to say. He  is like a man who has sent a virile and rather vindictive rival unjustly  to penal servitude; and who connives at the continuance of the sentence,  not because he himself is particularly vindictive,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27262"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 3, May 1906 (#9)"],[1,"of  \"Hannele,\" at the Angel of Death with the impenetrable brow, over whom  Hannele passes into the region of beauty, I have the consciousness, that  that is Gerhart Hauptmann, such is the inexhaustible wealth of his inner  world.    The stress of the life effort and the certainty of death, groping forth  from delicate intimacies, ripened the fineness and sweetness of this  man's soul. The picture contains transitoriness, finiteness, yet also a  vista of new formation, new land.    Of Gerhart Hauptmann one can say, his art has given meaning to the idea  of human love, which in this period is looked upon with suspicious eyes  as a bad coin, a new impetus, the reality and symbolic depth of which  grips the heart. Out of his books one can draw life more than  literature. A strong soul-similarity with Tolstoi might be observed, I  think, if Hauptmann were a fighting spirit.    I met the poet among the weavers of the Eulengebirge, Silesia, in the  districts of greatest human misery, February, 1891, in Langenbielau, the  large Silesian weaving village. One evening, on my return from a  journey, I was informed that a tall gentleman in black had inquired for  me. The name of the stranger was Gerhart Hauptmann, who came to study  the conditions of the weaving districts. The visitor had taken lodgings  in the \"Preussischen Hof,\" where I called on him the same evening, with  joyous expectation. The name of Gerhart Hauptmann in those days seemed  to contain a watchword, a battle call: not only against the unimportant  thrones of literature at that time but also against social oppression,  prejudices and moral crippling. Hauptmann's first drama, \"Vor  Sonnenaufgang,\" had just appeared and been produced by the Free Stage in  Berlin; and had operated like an explosive. It was followed by a flood  of vicious and vile criticism. The literary clique little imagined that  the future held great success for such \"stuff\" both in book form and on  the stage.    This lamentable lack of judgment misled the various pot-boiler writers  to attack the new tendency with the most repulsive arguments. One  leading paper of those days wrote of Hauptmann as an individual of a  pronounced criminal physiognomy, of whom one could expect nothing else  but dirty, appalling things.    Such literary highway assaults made one feel doubly happy over the fact,  that together with Hauptmann were a few splendidly armed fighters, like  the aged Fontane, with his great poise and fine exactness.    The first impression of Hauptmann was that he was not a man of easy  social carriage, rather discreet, almost shy, and uncommunicative. An  absorbed, deep dreamer, yet a keen observer of the human all too human,  not easily led astray, not Goethe, rather Hoelderlin.    The guest room of the \"Preussischen Hof\" contained many empty benches.  The keeper thereof had ample time to meditate over the mission of the  strange gentleman, in the weaving districts. I learned the next morning  that he had quite decided that Hauptmann was some government emissary,  intrusted with examining the prevailing distress of the weavers. One  thing, however, appeared suspicious, the man associated with the \"Reds,\"  who, according to the government newspaper, only exaggerated the need  and poverty to incite the people for their own political ends.    Whether or not the misery of the weavers that winter had reached such a  point as to warrant an official investigation, had been the topic of  discussion for weeks. The State Attorney, too, had taken an active part  in the matter. The criticism in the labor paper, \"The Proletarian,\" of  which I was the editor, that the exorbitant profit-making methods of the  manufacturers, which left the workers nothing to live on, were met with  a number of indictments against the paper on the following grounds: \"It  was indictable to incite the public at the moment when the prevailing  poverty was in itself sufficient to arouse the people and cause danger;  that this was criminal, and therefore punishable. The distress was  thereby officially acknowledged; was that not sufficient? Why then hold  the conditions up before the special attention of the people?\"    We mapped out a tour through the home-weaving settlements. At  Langenbielau, the textile industry had to a large extent been carried on  in mills and factories and at a higher wage. Misery was not so appalling  and hopeless there, as in the huts of the home weavers.    The following days unrolled a horrible picture before the eyes of the  poet. The figures of Baumann and Ansorge from his play \"The Weavers\"  became real.    With mute accusation on their lips, they moved before the human eye in  tangible shape; yet one longed to believe they were only phantoms. They  lived, but how they lived was a burning shame to civilization. Huts,  standing deep in the snow, like whitened sepulchres, and despair staring  from every nook, in these days of paternal care, just as at the time of  the famine that swept across the district in 1844.    Strewn among the hills and valleys lay bits of industry that had been  passed by technical progress, as so many damned, spooklike spots; and  yet those, who vegetated, worked and gradually perished here, were  compelled to compete with the great productive giants of steel and iron  machinery.    The poet entered these homes not with the spirit of a cool observer, nor  as a samaritan,--he came as man to man, with no appearance of one  stooping to poor Lazarus. Indeed, it seemed as though Hauptmann walked  with a much steadier gait in the path of human misery, than on the road  of conventionality.    Steinseifersdorf, situated beyond Peterswaldau. A bare snow field,  spread about huts of clay, shingles and branches, without a sign of  life. Neither a cat, dog nor sparrow, not even chimney smoke, to  indicate the activity of the inhabitants. Heated dwellings in this  stretch of land are luxuries, difficult of achievement; and how is one  to prepare a warm meal out of nothing?    We attempted to enter one of the huts to the right; there was no path  leading to it, so that we were compelled to work our way through the  deep snow. Was it possible that human beings breathed within? The old  weather-worn shanty looked as if the slightest breeze would tumble it  over. The few wooden steps, leading to the entrance, creaked underneath  our steps, and our knock was met with dead silence. We knocked again,  and this time heard a faint step slowly moving toward the door; a heavy  wooden bolt was moved aside, and we perceived a human face, with the  expression of a wounded, frightened animal. Like a delinquent, caught at  the offense, the human being at the door stared at the invaders. Not a  ray of hope enlivened the dead expression. No doubt the man had long  ceased to expect amelioration of his needs from his fellow beings. The  figure was covered with rags, and what rags! Not the kind of rags, that  tramps wear and which they throw off when luck strikes them, but eternal  rags, that seemed to have grown to the skin, to have mingled with it so  long that they had become part of it,--disgustingly filthy, but the only  cover he had and that he could not throw away.    The man, about fifty years of age, was silent and led us through a  dirty, cold gray entry into a room. In front of the loom we observed the  drooping figure of a woman, a cold oven, four dirty, wet walls, at one  of them a wooden bunk also covered with rags that served as bedding;  nothing else. The man murmured something to the woman, she rose; both  had inflamed eyes, water dripping from them with the same monotony as  from the walls.    Hauptmann began to speak hesitatingly, depressed by the sight of such  misery. He received a few harsh replies. The last piece of cloth had  been delivered some time since; there was neither bread, flour,  potatoes, coal nor wood in the house; in fact, no food or fuel of any  sort. This was said in a subdued, fearful voice, as if they expected  severe censure or punishment. Hauptmann gave the woman some money. The  thought of going without leaving sufficient for a supply of food at  least for the next few days, was agony.    On the widening of the road stood the village inn. The guest room showed  little comfort, the innkeeper looked worn and in bad spirits. No trade.  Innkeepers of factory towns are better off. They can afford guest rooms  of a higher order, since they enjoy the patronage of bookkeepers, clerks  and teachers. In Steinseifersdorf one had to depend on the weavers, and  that did not bring enough for a square meal, especially in the winter.  The wife of the innkeeper assured us that the misery in Kaschbach, a  neighboring village, was even greater, even more awful. It was getting  late, so we decided to go there the following day.    Our conversation on our ride homeward dwelt on the fate of these  unfortunates, condemned by modern industrialism to a life of the  Inferno. I asked Hauptmann what an effect an artistic, dramatic  representation of such a fate could possibly have. He replied that his  inclinations were more for summernight's dreams toward sunny vistas, but  that an impelling inner force urged him to use this appalling want as an  object of his art. As for the hoped-for effect, human beings are not  insensible; even the most satisfied, the most comfortable or rich must  be gripped in his innermost depths when pictures of such terrible human  wretchedness are being unrolled before him. Every human being is related  to another.    My remark that the right of possession has the tendency to blind those  who are part of it, Hauptmann would not accept as generally true. He was  anxious to bring the sympathies of the wealthy into energetic activity;  sympathies that would, of course, bring to the poor real relief from  their hideous conditions. He added that the poverty of the masses had at  times tortured him to such an extent that he was unable to partake"]]]
