When the Revolution began, he sided of course with  his own people, and he stood two sieges by the Indians in Boonesborough.  It was here that Boone found him in 1778 when he escaped from Old  Chillicothe, and they promptly made a foray together into the Ohio  country, against an Indian town on Paint Creek. They fell in with a war  party on the way, and after some fighting, Boone went back, but Kenton  kept on with another friend, and did not return till they had stolen  some Indian horses. As soon as they reached Boonesborough the commandant  sent them into Ohio again to reconnoiter a town on the Little Miami  which he wished to attack, and here once more Kenton was tempted by the  chance to steal horses. He could not bear to leave any, and he and his  men started homeward through the woods with the whole herd. When they  came to the Ohio, it was so rough that Kenton was nearly drowned in  trying to cross the river. He got back to the northern shore, where they  all waited for the wind to go down, and the waves to fall, and where  the Indians found them the second morning. His comrades were killed and  Kenton was taken prisoner by the Indians whose horses they had stolen.  The Indians were always stealing white men's horses, but they seemed to  think it was very much more wicked and shameful for white men to steal  Indians' horses. They fell upon Kenton and beat him over the head with  their ramrods and mocked him with cries of, \"Steal Indians' hoss, hey!\"  But this was only the beginning of his sufferings. They fastened him  for the night by stretching him on the ground with one stick across  his breast and another down his middle, and tying his hands and feet to  these with thongs of buffalo skin: stakes were driven into the earth,  and his pinioned arms and legs were bound to them, while a halter, which  was passed round his neck and then round a sapling near by, kept him  from moving his head. All the while they were making sure in this  way that he should not escape, the Indians were cuffing his ears, and  reviling him for a \"Tief! A hoss steal! A rascal!\" In the morning they  mounted him on an unbroken colt, with his hands tied behind him and his  legs tied under the horse, and drove it into the briers and underbrush,  where his face and hands were torn by the brambles, until the colt  quieted down of itself, and followed in line with the other horses. The  third day, as they drew near the town of Old Chillicothe, where Boone  had been held captive, they were met by the chief Blackfish, who said  sternly to Kenton in English, \"You have been stealing horses.\" \"Yes,  sir.\" \"Did Captain Boone tell you to steal our horses?\" \"No, sir, I did  it on my own accord.\" Blackfish then lashed him over the naked back with  a hickory switch till the blood ran, and with blows and taunts from all  sides Kenton was marched forward to the village.    The Indians could not wait for his arrival. They came out, men, women,  and children, to meet him, with whoops and yells, and when they had made  his captors fasten him to a stake, they fell upon him, and tore off all  that was left of his clothes, and amused themselves till midnight by  dancing and screaming round him, and beating him with rods and their  open hands. In the morning he was ordered to run the gantlet, through  two rows of Indians of all ages and sexes, armed with knives, clubs,  switches, and hoe handles, and ready to cut, strike, and stab at him as  he dashed by them on his way to the council house, a quarter of a mile  from the point of starting. But Kenton was too wary to take the risks  before him. He suddenly started aside from the lines; he turned and  doubled in his course, and managed to reach the council house unhurt  except for the blows of two Indians who threw themselves between him and  its door. Here a council was held at once, and he was sentenced to be  burnt at the stake, but the sentence was ordered to be carried out at  the town of Wapatimika on Mad River. A white renegade among the Indians  told him of his fate with a curse, and Kenton resolved that rather than  meet it he would die in the attempt to escape. On the way to Wapatimika  he gave his guard the slip and dashed into the woods; and he had left  his pursuers far behind, when he ran into the midst of another party  of Indians, who seized him and drove him forward to the town. A second  council was now held, and after Kenton had run the gantlet a second time  and been severely hurt, the warriors once more gathered in the council  house, and sitting on the ground in a circle voted his death by striking  the earth with a war club, or by passing it to the next if inclined to  mercy. He was brought before them, as he supposed, to be told when he  was to die, but a blanket was thrown upon the ground for him to sit upon  in the middle of the circle, and Simon Girty, the great renegade, who  was cruder to the whites than the Indians themselves, began harshly to  question him about the number of men in Kentucky. A few words passed,  and then Girty asked, \"What is your name?\" \"Simon Butler,\" said Kenton,  and Girty jumped from his seat and threw his arms around Kenton's  neck. They had been scouts together in the English service, before the  Revolution began, and had been very warm friends, and now Girty set  himself to save Kenton's life. He pleaded so strongly in his favor that  the council at last voted to spare him, at least for the time being.    [Illustration: Kenton and Girty 072]    Three weeks of happiness for Kenton followed in the society of his old  friend, who clothed him at his own cost from the stores of an English  trader in the town, and took him to live with him; and it is said that  if the Indians had continued to treat him kindly, Kenton might perhaps  have cast his lot with them, for he could not hope to go back to his own  people, with the crime of murder, as he supposed, hanging over him, and  he had no close ties binding him to the whites elsewhere. But at the  end of these days of respite, a war party came back from the Virginian  border, where they had been defeated, and the life of the first white  man who fell into their power must pay, by the Indian law, for the life  of the warrior they had lost. The leaders of this party found Kenton  walking in the woods with Girty, and met him with scowls of hate,  refusing his hand when he offered it. The rage of the savages against  him broke out afresh. One of them caught an ax from his squaw who was  chopping wood, and as Kenton passed him on his way into the village,  dealt him a blow that cut deep into his shoulder. For a third time a  council was held, and for a third time Kenton was doomed to die by fire.  Nothing that Girty could say availed, and he was left to tell his friend  that he must die.    Kenton's sentence was to be now carried out at Sandusky, and with five  Indian guards he set out for that point. On their way they stopped at a  town on the waters of the Scioto, where the captive found himself in  the presence of a chief of noble and kindly face, who said to him, in  excellent English, \"Well, young man, these young men seem very mad at  you.\" Kenton had to own that they were so, indeed, and then the Indian  said, \"Well, don't be discouraged. I am a great chief. You are to go to  Sandusky; they speak of burning you there, but I will send two runners  tomorrow to speak good for you.\"    This was the noble chief Logan, whose beautiful speech ought to be known  to every American boy and girl, and who, in spite of all he had suffered  from them, was still the friend of the white men. He kept his word  to Kenton, though he seemed to fail, as Girty had failed, to have his  sentence set aside, and Kenton was taken on to Sandusky. But here, the  day before that set for him to die, a British Indian agent, a merciful  man whose name, Drewyer, we ought to remember, made the Indians give him  up, that the commandant at Detroit might find out from him the state  of the American forces in Kentucky. He had to promise the savages that  Kenton should afterwards be returned to them; but though Kenton could  not or would not tell him what he wished to know, Drewyer assured him  that he would never abandon any white prisoner to their cruelty.    At Detroit Kenton was kindly treated by the English, and beyond having  to report himself daily to the officer who had charge of him, there was  nothing to make him feel that he was a prisoner. But he grew restive in  his captivity, and after he had borne seven months of it, and got well  of all his wounds and bruises, he plotted with two young Kentuckians,  who had been taken with Boone at the Blue Licks, to attempt his escape  with them. They bought guns from some drunken Indians, and hid them  in the woods. Then in the month of June, 1778, they started southward  through the wilderness, and after thirty days reached Louisville in  safety. Kenton continued to fight the Indians in all the wars, large  and little, till they were beaten by General Wayne in 1794. Eight years  later he came to live in Ohio, settling near Urbana, but removing later  to Zanesfield, on the site of the Indian town Wapatimika, where he was  once to have been burned, and where he died peaceably in 1836, when he  was eighty-one years old. He is described as a tall, handsome man, of  an erect figure and carriage, a fair complexion, and a most attractive  countenance. \"He had,\" his biographer tells us, \"a soft, tremulous  voice, very pleasing to the hearer, and laughing gray eyes that appeared  to fascinate the beholder,\" except in his rare moments of anger, when  their fiery glance would curdle the blood of those who had roused his  wrath. He was above all the heroes of Ohio history, both in his virtues  and his vices, the type of the Indian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21391"],[0,"Great African Travellers: From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley (#9)"],[1," overtaken by one of Kafa's domestic slaves with poor Nealee's  garment on the end of a bow.  On making inquiries of the man, he replied  that Kafa and the schoolmaster would not consent to her being killed,  but had left her on the road, where probably she was soon devoured by  wild animals.    Such is one example of the cruel treatment received by the unhappy  slaves.  The old schoolmaster, however, was so affected, that he fasted  the whole of the ensuing day.    The party now travelled on rapidly, everyone being apprehensive that he  might otherwise meet with the fate of poor Nealee.    The coffle had still many dangers to encounter.  Receiving information  that two hundred Jallonkas were lying in wait to plunder them, they  altered their course and travelled with great secrecy until midnight,  when they entered the town of Koba.  Here they remained some days to  escape the Jallonkas.    The next town they reached, Malacotta, was the birthplace of the  schoolmaster, whose brother came out to meet him.  The interview was  very natural and affecting.  They fell on each other's neck, and it was  some time before either of them could speak.  The schoolmaster then  turning, pointed to Kafa, saying, \"This is the man who has been my  father in Manding.  I would have pointed him out sooner to you, but my  heart was too full.\"    They were now in the country of friends, and were well received at each  of the towns they entered.    Park, however, witnessed numerous instances of the sad effects of the  slave trade.  A singing man, the master of one of the slaves who had  travelled for some time with great difficulty, and was found unable to  proceed further, proposed to exchange him for a young slave girl  belonging to one of the townspeople.  The poor girl was ignorant of her  fate until the bundles were all laid up in the morning, and the coffle  ready to depart, when, coming with some of the other young women to see  the coffle set out, her master took her by the hand and delivered her to  the singing man.  Never was a face of serenity more suddenly changed  into one of the deepest distress; the terror she manifested on having  the load put on her head and the rope round her neck, and the sorrow  with which she bid adieu to her companions, were truly affecting.  Notwithstanding the treatment which the slaves received, they had hearts  which could feel for the white stranger amidst their infinitely greater  sufferings, and they frequently of their own accord brought water to  quench his thirst, and at night collected branches and leaves for his  bed, during that weary journey of more than five hundred British miles.    Knowing that the greater number were doomed to a life of slavery in a  foreign land, he could not part from them without feeling much emotion.    At last Pisania was reached, and Park was warmly welcomed as one risen  from the dead by the Mr Ainsleys and Dr Laidley.  They had heard that  the Moors had murdered him as they had murdered Major Haughton.  He  learned with great sorrow that neither of his two attendants, Johnson  and Demba, had returned, and that nothing was known of them.  Park gave  double the amount he had promised to Kafa, and sent a present also to  the good old schoolmaster at Malacotta.  Kafa, who had never before  heard English spoken, listened with great attention to Park, when  conversing with his friends.  His astonishment at the various articles  of furniture in the houses was very great; but it was still greater when  he saw Mr Ainsley's schooner lying in the river.  He could not  comprehend the use of the masts and sails, or conceive how so large a  body could be moved by the wind.  He was frequently heard to exclaim,  with a sigh: \"Ah! black men are nothing.\"    After waiting at Pisania some time, finding no vessel likely to sail  direct for England, he took his passage on board a slave vessel bound  for South Carolina.  She, however, meeting with bad weather, put into  Antigua, and from thence he sailed in an English packet, and arrived at  Falmouth on the 22nd of December, having been from England about two  years and seven months.

Soon after his return to England Park married the daughter of Mr  Anderson, with whom he had served his apprenticeship, and resided a  couple of years with his mother and one of his brothers on the farm that  his father had occupied at Fowlshiels, in Scotland.  After this he  practised his profession for some time at Peebles.  But this sort of  life not satisfying his ardent temperament, on hearing from Sir Joseph  Banks that another expedition into Africa to explore the Niger was  proposed, he at once offered his services.    Nothing, however, was settled till the year 1803, when, being directed  to hold himself in readiness to proceed to Africa, he engaged a native  of Mogadore, named Sidi Omback Boubi, then residing in London, to  accompany him to Scotland for the purpose of instructing him in Arabic.    Nearly another year passed before all arrangements were concluded.  It  was finally determined that the expedition should consist of Park  himself, his brother-in-law (Mr Anderson), and Mr George Scott, who  was to act as draughtsman, together with a few boat-builders and  artificers.  They were to be joined at Goree by a party of soldiers of  the African corps stationed in that garrison.    Three months after this elapsed ere they set sail on board the  \"Crescent\" transport on the 30th of January, 1805; and, after touching  at Saint Jago to obtain asses for the journey, they reached Goree on the  28th of March.    There was no lack of volunteers, the whole garrison offering their  services.  Thirty-five soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Martyn  of the Royal Artillery Corps were selected, as well as two sailors from  the \"Squirrel\" frigate.    They left Goree on the 6th of April, the men jumping into the boats in  the highest spirits, and bidding adieu to their friends with repeated  huzzas.    Landing at Kayee on the northern bank of the Gambia, they commenced  their overland journey to Pisania on the 27th of April.  The weather was  intensely hot, and the asses, unaccustomed to carry loads, made their  march very fatiguing and troublesome, three of the animals sticking fast  in a muddy rice field soon after they started.    So many delays had occurred that the rainy season was already  approaching, and it would have been more prudent had the expedition  remained at Goree or Pisania till the country had become again suitable  for travelling.  It was just possible, however, that they might reach  the Niger before the middle of June, when the rainy season usually  commences, and that river could then have been navigated without much  exposure or toil.  So eager, however, was Mr Park to proceed, that he  disregarded the warnings of his friends, and determined to set forth on  his journey.    Several days were lost at Pisania in arranging the burdens of the asses  and in purchasing more animals, as those they possessed were not  sufficient for carrying all the loads.    He here engaged a Mandingo priest named Isaaco, who was also a  travelling merchant, to serve as a guide, and, on the 4th of May, all  being ready, the caravan set forth from Pisania, whence nearly ten years  before Park had commenced his adventurous journey into the interior.    The arrangements for the march were well devised.  The animals as well  as their loads were marked and numbered with red paint, and a certain  number allotted to the care of each of the six messes into which the  soldiers were divided.  Mr Scott and Isaaco generally led, Lieutenant  Martyn marched in the centre, and Anderson and Park brought up the rear.    All their forethought, however, could not guard them against the deadly  attacks of the climate.  The asses from the first gave them a great deal  of trouble--many, from being overloaded, lying down in the road, while  others kicked off their bundles--so that the caravan made but slow  progress.    They had not gone far when two of the soldiers died, and, a few days  afterwards, another lost his life.    At most of the places through which they passed they were well received;  but at the town of Bady the chief man demanded enormously high duties,  and sent a large band of armed followers to collect them.  When Isaaco  was sent over to Bady to enquire the reason of this conduct, he was  seized, his weapons taken from him, and he was tied to a tree and  flogged.  It was proposed to attack the place; but early the next day  the guide was sent back, and the matter was settled by payment of a  portion of the duties demanded.    While halting at a creek, the asses being unloaded, some of the men went  in search of honey.  Unfortunately they disturbed a large swarm of bees,  which, rushing out, attacked both men and beasts.
