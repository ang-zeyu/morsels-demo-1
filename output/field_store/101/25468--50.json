They are legally married, for  the head of the Church--who is moreover by my grandfather's will the  head of our family--has granted his permission. I only pity my poor  sister; I pity her for becoming so young the prey of a wretched man who  sacrifices her to his own ambition, hoping by this marriage to establish  a claim to the throne. O God! what a strange fate oppresses the royal  house of Anjou! My father's early death in the midst of his triumphs; my  mother's so quickly after; my sister and I, the sole offspring of  Charles I, both before we are women grown fallen into the hands of  cowardly men, who use us but as the stepping-stones of their ambition!\"  Joan fell back exhausted on her chair, a burning tear trembling on her  eyelid.    \"This is the second time,\" said Bertrand reproachfully, \"that I have  drawn my sword to avenge an insult offered to you, the second time I  return it by your orders to the scabbard. But remember, Joan, the third  time will not find me so docile, and then it will not be Robert of  Cabane or Charles of Durazzo that I shall strike, but him who is the  cause of all your misfortunes.\"    \"Have mercy, Bertrand! do not you also speak these words; whenever this  horrible thought takes hold of me, let me come to you: this threat of  bloodshed that is drummed into my ears, this sinister vision that haunts  my sight; let me come to you, beloved, and weep upon your bosom, beneath  your breath cool my burning fancies, from your eyes draw some little  courage to revive my perishing soul. Come, I am quite unhappy enough  without needing to poison the future by an endless remorse. Tell me  rather to forgive and to forget, speak not of hatred and revenge; show  me one ray of hope amid the darkness that surrounds me; hold up my  wavering feet, and push me not into the abyss.\"    Such altercations as this were repeated as often as any fresh wrong  arose from the side of Andre or his party; and in proportion as the  attacks made by Bertrand and his friends gained in vehemence--and we  must add, in justice--so did Joan's objections weaken. The Hungarian  rule, as it became more and more arbitrary and unbearable, irritated  men's minds to such a point that the people murmured in secret and the  nobles proclaimed aloud their discontent. Andre's soldiers indulged in a  libertinage which would have been intolerable in a conquered city: they  were found everywhere brawling in the taverns or rolling about  disgustingly drunk in the gutters; and the prince, far from rebuking  such orgies, was accused of sharing them himself. His former tutor, who  ought to have felt bound to drag him away from so ignoble a mode of  life, rather strove to immerse him in degrading pleasures, so as to keep  him out of business matters; without suspecting it, he was hurrying on  the denouement of the terrible drama that was being acted behind the  scenes at Castel Nuovo. Robert's widow, Dona Sancha of Aragon, the good  and sainted lady whom our readers may possibly have forgotten, as her  family had done, seeing that God's anger was hanging over her house, and  that no counsels, no tears or prayers of hers could avail to arrest it,  after wearing mourning for her husband one whole year, according to her  promise, had taken the veil at the convent of Santa Maria delta Croce,  and deserted the court and its follies and passions, just as the  prophets of old, turning their back on some accursed city, would shake  the dust from off their sandals and depart. Sandra's retreat was a sad  omen, and soon the family dissensions, long with difficulty suppressed,  sprang forth to open view; the storm that had been threatening from afar  broke suddenly over the town, and the thunderbolt was shortly to follow.    On the last day of August 1344, Joan rendered homage to Americ, Cardinal  of Saint Martin and legate of Clement VI, who looked upon the kingdom of  Naples as being a fief of the Church ever since the time when his  predecessors had presented it to Charles of Anjou, and overthrown and  excommunicated the house of Suabia. For this solemn ceremony the church  of Saint Clara was chosen, the burial-place of Neapolitan kings, and but  lately the tomb of the grandfather and father of the young queen, who  reposed to right and left of the high altar. Joan, clad in the royal  robe, with the crown upon her head, uttered her oath of fidelity between  the hands of the apostolic legate in the presence of her husband, who  stood behind her simply as a witness, just like the other princes of the  blood. Among the prelates with their pontifical insignia who formed the  brilliant following of the envoy, there stood the Archbishops of Pisa,  Bari, Capua, and Brindisi, and the reverend fathers Ugolino, Bishop of  Castella, and Philip, Bishop of Cavaillon, chancellor to the queen. All  the nobility of Naples and Hungary were present at this ceremony, which  debarred Andre from the throne in a fashion at once formal and striking.  Thus, when they left the church the excited feelings of both parties  made a crisis imminent, and such hostile glances, such threatening words  were exchanged, that the prince, finding himself too weak to contend  against his enemies, wrote the same evening to his mother, telling her  that he was about to leave a country where from his infancy upwards he  had experienced nothing but deceit and disaster.    Those who know a mother's heart will easily guess that Elizabeth of  Poland was no sooner aware of the danger that threatened her son than  she travelled to Naples, arriving there before her coming was suspected.  Rumour spread abroad that the Queen of Hungary had come to take her son  away with her, and the unexpected event gave rise to strange comments:  the fever of excitement now blazed up in another direction. The Empress  of Constantinople, the Catanese, her two daughters, and all the  courtiers, whose calculations were upset by Andre's departure, hurried  to honour the arrival of the Queen of Hungary by offering a very cordial  and respectful reception, with a view to showing her that, in the midst  of a court so attentive and devoted, any isolation or bitterness of  feeling on the young prince's part must spring from his pride, from an  unwarrantable mistrust, and his naturally savage and untrained  character. Joan received her husband's mother with so much proper  dignity in her behaviour that, in spite of preconceived notions,  Elizabeth could not help admiring the noble seriousness and earnest  feeling she saw in her daughter-in-law. To make the visit more pleasant  to an honoured guest, fetes and tournaments were given, the barons vying  with one another in display of wealth and luxury. The Empress of  Constantinople, the Catanese, Charles of Duras and his young wife, all  paid the utmost attention to the mother of the prince. Marie, who by  reason of her extreme youth and gentleness of character had no share in  any intrigues, was guided quite as much by her natural feeling as by her  husband's orders when she offered to the Queen of Hungary those marks of  regard and affection that she might have felt for her own mother. In  spite, however, of these protestations of respect and love, Elizabeth of  Poland trembled for her son, and, obeying a maternal instinct, chose to  abide by her original intention, believing that she should never feel  safe until Andre was far away from a court in appearance so friendly but  in reality so treacherous. The person who seemed most disturbed by the  departure, and tried to hinder it by every means in his power, was Friar  Robert. Immersed in his political schemes, bending over his mysterious  plans with all the eagerness of a gambler who is on the point of  gaining, the Dominican, who thought himself on the eve of a tremendous  event, who by cunning, patience, and labour hoped to scatter his enemies  and to reign as absolute autocrat, now falling suddenly from the edifice  of his dream, stiffened himself by a mighty effort to stand and resist  the mother of his pupil. But fear cried too loud in the heart of  Elizabeth for all the reasonings of the monk to lull it to rest: to  every argument he advanced she simply said that while her son was not  king and had not entire unlimited power, it was imprudent to leave him  exposed to his enemies. The monk, seeing that all was indeed lost and  that he could not contend against the fears of this woman, asked only  the boon of three days' grace, at the end of which time, should a reply  he was expecting have not arrived, he said he would not only give up his  opposition to Andre's departure, but would follow himself, renouncing  for ever a scheme to which he had sacrificed everything.    Towards the end of the third day, as Elizabeth was definitely making her  preparations for departure, the monk entered radiant. Showing her a  letter which he had just hastily broken open, he cried triumphantly--    \"God be praised, madam! I can at last give you incontestable proofs of  my active zeal and accurate foresight.\"    Andre's mother, after rapidly running through the document, turned her  eyes on the monk with yet some traces of mistrust in her manner, not  venturing to give way to her sudden joy.    \"Yes, madam,\" said the monk, raising his head, his plain features  lighted up by his glance of intelligence--\"yes, madam, you will believe  your eyes, perhaps, though you would never believe my words: this is not  the dream of an active imagination, the hallucination of a credulous  mind, the prejudice of a limited intellect; it is a plan slowly  conceived, painfully worked out, my daily thought and my whole life's  work. I have never ignored the fact that at the court of Avignon your  son had powerful enemies; but I knew also that on the very day I  undertook a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27509"],[0,"The 2006 CIA World Factbook (#9)"],[1,"Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches  followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums;  mortality rate is approximately 30%.    Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and  humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection  may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood;  geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where  cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and  some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic  fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about  1% of cases.    Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated  with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by  sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7  days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.    water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in  freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:    Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans;  infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated  by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache,  vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in  kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress;  fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.    Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm Schistosoma;  fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of  parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated  water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys,  and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues  triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or  intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity;  mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due  to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of  infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the  reservoir for this parasite.    aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation of  aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:    Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys;  endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct  contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or  fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in  epidemic outbreaks.    respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an infectious  person:    Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of  the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important  bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of its potential  to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches,  and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by  respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact  resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal  distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48  hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease  occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the  \"Meningitis Belt\" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.    animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local  animals:    Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite  of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central  nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially  are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological  symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.    Manpower available for military service    This entry gives the number of males and females falling in the  military age range for the country and assumes that every individual is  fit to serve.    Manpower fit for military service    This entry gives the number of males and females falling in the  military age range for the country and who are not otherwise  disqualified for health reasons; accounts for the health situation in  the country and provides a more realistic estimate of the actual number  fit to serve.    Manpower reaching military service age annually    This entry gives the number of draft-age males and females entering the  military manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of the  availability of draft-age young adults.    Map references    This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference map on which a  country may be found. The entry on Geographic coordinates may be  helpful in finding some smaller countries.    Maritime claims    This entry includes the following claims, the definitions of which are  excerpted from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and definitive descriptions:    territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond its  land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea,  described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this  sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well  as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right to  establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not  exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the  breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as  marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal  state; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic states.    contiguous zone - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a zone  contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it may  exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its customs,  fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its  territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the above laws and  regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea; the  contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the  baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured  (e.g. the US has claimed a 12-nautical mile contiguous zone in addition  to its 12-nautical mile territorial sea).    exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ as  a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a coastal  state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and  exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether  living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of  the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the  economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the  production of energy from the water, currents, and winds; jurisdiction  with regard to the establishment and use of artificial islands,  installations, and structures; marine scientific research; the  protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer limit  of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical miles from  the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is  measured.    continental shelf - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental  shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the  submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the  natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the  continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the  baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured  where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to  that distance; the continental margin comprises the submerged  prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and consists of the  seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise; wherever the  continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline,  coastal states may extend their claim to a distance not to exceed 350  nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2500  meter isobath; it does not include the deep ocean floor with its  oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.    exclusive fishing zone - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS,  some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an EEZ,  but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off their  coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often used;  the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or 200  nautical miles.    Median age    This entry is the age that divides a population into two numerically  equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and  half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age  distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from a  low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several  European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for the  importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by  implication, a low versus a higher median age.    Merchant marine    Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage of  goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships),  which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. This  entry contains information in four fields - total, ships by type,  foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.    Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for  those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage  is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc., that a ship  can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line. GRT or gross  register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered  volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers"]]]
