Collect several nymphs and keep them in a jar of water and study their  movements and feeding habits. Disturb one with a pencil or straw and see  how it darts forward. It has a water chamber in the large intestines,  including also the respiratory tracheal gills, from which the water can  be suddenly squirted which throws the insect forward. The escaping  stream of water forces the insect forward on the same principle as the  rotating lawn sprinkler. If you collect some almost mature nymphs and  keep them for a time in a vessel of water you may see them crawl out of  the water, shed their skin and change to winged adults. Collect a few  adults of different species for pinning in your permanent collection.          CHAPTER XIV    THE SQUASH BUG      This common blackish or earth-colored bug is usually called the squash  stink-bug. It has a very disagreeable odor which gives it this name.  When disturbed it throws off from scent glands a small quantity of an  oily substance which produces this odor. This is a protection to it for  few birds or animals care to feed on it. Most species of sap or blood  sucking true bugs have a similar protecting odor.    The squash bug feeds largely on squash and pumpkins. It has a slender  beak with needle-like mouth parts which are stuck into the plant for  extracting the sap. It feeds only on plant sap. When it can not get  squash or pumpkins it will feed on watermelons, muskmelons and related  crops. It is very destructive to these crops. It not only extracts sap  thus weakening the plant but it also seems to poison the plant while  feeding. In this way its bite injures the plant something like the  effects of the bed-bug's bite on our flesh. It feeds first on the leaves  and vines often killing them in a few days. Later it may cluster and  feed on the unripe squashes or pumpkins in such numbers as to completely  cover them. Every country boy or girl has seen these stinking bugs on  pumpkins in the corn field, at corn cutting time in the fall.    [Illustration: Pumpkin in field covered with adults and nymphs of squash  stink-bug.]    The squash bug lives thru the winter as the matured winged insect. It  flies from its food plant to winter quarters late in the fall. For  winter protection it may enter buildings, hide under shingles on roofs,  crawl into piles of lumber, under bark of dead trees or stumps or hide  under any similar protection. When its chosen food crops begin to come  up in the spring it leaves its winter home and flies in search of food.  After feeding for a time the female lays patches of oval, flattened,  gold-colored eggs set on edge. When first deposited the eggs have a  pale color but in a short time the golden color appears. In some cases  only three or four eggs may be found in one patch while again there may  be twenty or thirty of them. They are so brightly colored that they can  easily be seen and most boys and girls have seen them on the leaves of  squashes or pumpkins.    [Illustration: Cluster of golden-brown eggs of squash stink-bug showing  two recently hatched nymphs.]    In a few days after they are laid they hatch and out of each crawls a  small, long-legged blackish or greenish young bug called the nymph.  These little fellows usually stay in a crowd hiding on the under side of  a leaf. After feeding for a time their leaf begins to turn yellow and  soon dies. Then they move to a new leaf. As they feed they grow rapidly  and after shedding their skins they change to the second nymph stage.  This shedding of their skins or molting occurs five times before they  mature. Of course each time before the old skin or suit of clothes is  discarded a new one is developed beneath. The females may continue to  deposit eggs for later clusters of young. They become most abundant on  the crop late in the fall. Just before cold weather sets in the adults  again seek winter shelter.    This is a very difficult insect to control. Since it feeds on liquid sap  only it is impossible to kill it by spraying the crop with a poison such  as arsenate of lead. It can not chew and swallow such poison. The young  can be killed fairly well with a spray or dust containing nicotine but  such treatments are not effective against the adults or nearly mature  nymphs. A better method is to destroy all the bugs possible in the fall  before they go to the winter protection and then watch for and destroy  the adults and the eggs masses in the spring when they appear on the  young crop. If the first adults and the eggs and newly hatched nymphs  are destroyed the crop can be protected against the destructive work  later.      OBSERVATIONS AND FIELD STUDIES    Plant a few squash hills in the garden in the spring and also plant a  few seeds in rich dirt in discarded tin cans or flower pots. As the  spring advances and the squashes start to vine watch for squash bugs on  them. Examine in piles of lumber, stove wood and under bark for some of  the bugs before they come to the squash hills. If any are found put them  on the squash plants in flower pots and cover them with a pint mason  fruit jar. Watch for eggs to appear on the plants and also examine for  eggs on the squashes in the garden. When eggs appear examine them  carefully, measure them and write a brief description of them. Try to  mash them between your fingers. When they hatch carefully study the  young nymph and describe it. Can you see the slender beak which incloses  the mouth parts? How many joints are there to the antennae? As the nymph  grows watch it shed its skin. How does it do it? Where does its skin  first crack? Save the cast skin and try to follow the nymph thru all  the nymph stages to the adult. Collect a bottle of the nymphs of varying  sizes from the garden. Examine them and describe the different stages.  Can you see the wings forming on the backs of the older nymphs? How many  small wing pads are there? Examine the adult closely and write a careful  description of it. Can you find where the secretion that causes the odor  is produced? How long will the odor stay on your hands? Can you wash it  off? Spread the wings of the adult and make a careful drawing of one  front and one hind wing showing accurately the wing veins. In the garden  try to protect all the hills of squash from the bugs except one or two  used for your studies. Write a brief description of your methods of  control.    [Illustration: Squash stink-bug adult and nymph extracting sap from  squash.]          CHAPTER XV    THE PLANT-LOUSE      For this chapter any common species of plant-louse may be used. If the  study is made in the spring the louse on rose, apple, clover, wheat or  any other crop may be used. If the study is made in the fall the species  on turnips, corn or other plant or crop may be selected. The different  species vary greatly but for these studies any available species will be  satisfactory.    The plant-louse or aphis is a sap-sucking insect which feeds and  multiplies rapidly often seriously injuring crops. The loss of sap  together with the poisoning effect of the bite causes the weakening of  the plant or leaf with its ultimate death if feeding continues. The  greatest damage is usually done during cold springs or during a cool  rainy period. This prevents the enemies of the louse from increasing and  attacking it while the weather may not be too severe to prevent the  louse from working. Under favorable climatic conditions the natural  enemies of the louse as a rule are able to hold it in check. The  principal enemies of the louse are certain small insect feeding birds,  lady-beetles, syrphid-flies, lace-wings and tiny wasp parasites. The  beneficial work of the lady-beetles is discussed in an earlier chapter.  The birds and lady-beetles devour them bodily, the larvae of the  lace-wings and syrphid-flies extract their blood while the wasps live as  internal parasites.    In the latitude of Missouri the plant-lice as a rule live thru the  winter in the form of a fertile egg attached to the twigs of trees and  shrubs. The winter egg is produced by a true female plant-louse. As a  rule there is only one generation of true males and females produced  each year. This brood develops late in the fall to produce the  fertilized winter eggs. In the spring these eggs hatch and the tiny  nymphs begin to extract sap. On maturing they begin to give birth to  young lice. Throughout the summer this method of reproduction continues.  These summer forms are known as the stem mothers or agamic females.  These are not true females for they produce living young in place of  eggs and during the summer no male lice are produced at all. This is  nature's way of increasing the race of plant-lice rapidly. Late in the  fall again a brood of true males and females is produced. During the  summer the plant-lice increase more rapidly than any other type of  insect.    [Illustration: Black winter eggs of Aphis showing how they are deposited  in masses on twigs of apple. (After U. S. Dept. Agri.)]    Plant-lice vary in size, color and general appearance. Many are green  while some are red or black or covered with a cottony secretion.      OBSERVATIONS AND FIELD STUDIES    Plant some melon, radish or other seeds in fertile soil in pots for use  in this study. When lice appear on crops in the garden or field, collect  a leaf with a few on it and carefully transfer them to the leaves on  your potted plants. Watch the lice feed and increase from day to day. A  reading lens or a magnifying glass will be helpful as plant-lice are  very small. How do they move about? Can you count their legs? How many  have they? Can you see their eyes and feelers? When feeding observe how  the beak is pressed against the leaf. Disturb one while it is feeding  and see it attempt to loosen its mouth parts.

That were an union I will not believe.        _Bel._ Where is the proof?        _Sal._                          I'll answer that, if once          200      The king demands your fellow-traitor's sword.        _Arb._ (_to Sal._). A sword which hath been drawn as oft as thine      Against his foes.        _Sal._          And now against his brother,      And in an hour or so against himself.        _Sar._ That is not possible: he dared not; no--      No--I'll not hear of such things. These vain bickerings      Are spawned in courts by base intrigues, and baser      Hirelings, who live by lies on good men's lives.      You must have been deceived, my brother.        _Sal._                                   First      Let him deliver up his weapon, and                                 210      Proclaim himself your subject by that duty,      And I will answer all.        _Sar._                 Why, if I thought so--      But no, it cannot be: the Mede Arbaces--      The trusty, rough, true soldier--the best captain      Of all who discipline our nations----No,      I'll not insult him thus, to bid him render      The scimitar to me he never yielded      Unto our enemies. Chief, keep your weapon.        _Sal._ (_delivering back the signet_).      Monarch, take back your signet.        _Sar._                          No, retain it;      But use it with more moderation.        _Sal._                          Sire,                             200      I used it for your honour, and restore it      Because I cannot keep it with my own.      Bestow it on Arbaces.        _Sar._                So I should:      He never asked it.        _Sal._             Doubt not, he will have it,      Without that hollow semblance of respect.        _Bel._ I know not what hath prejudiced the Prince      So strongly 'gainst two subjects, than whom none      Have been more zealous for Assyria's weal.        _Sal._ Peace, factious priest, and faithless soldier! thou      Unit'st in thy own person the worst vices                          230      Of the most dangerous orders of mankind.      Keep thy smooth words and juggling homilies      For those who know thee not. Thy fellow's sin      Is, at the least, a bold one, and not tempered      By the tricks taught thee in Chaldea.        _Bel._                                Hear him,      My liege--the son of Belus! he blasphemes      The worship of the land, which bows the knee      Before your fathers.        _Sar._               Oh! for that I pray you      Let him have absolution. I dispense with      The worship of dead men; feeling that I                            240      Am mortal, and believing that the race      From whence I sprung are--what I see them--ashes.        _Bel._ King! Do not deem so: they are with the stars,      And----        _Sar._   You shall join them ere they will rise,      If you preach farther--Why, _this_ is rank treason.        _Sal._ My lord!        _Sar._          To school me in the worship of      Assyria's idols! Let him be released--      Give him his sword.        _Sal._              My Lord, and King, and Brother,      I pray ye pause.        _Sar._           Yes, and be sermonised,      And dinned, and deafened with dead men and Baal,                   250      And all Chaldea's starry mysteries.        _Bel._ Monarch! respect them.        _Sar._                       Oh! for that--I love them;      I love to watch them in the deep blue vault,      And to compare them with my Myrrha's eyes;      I love to see their rays redoubled in      The tremulous silver of Euphrates' wave,      As the light breeze of midnight crisps the broad      And rolling water, sighing through the sedges      Which fringe his banks: but whether they may be      Gods, as some say, or the abodes of Gods,                          260      As others hold, or simply lamps of night,      Worlds--or the lights of Worlds--I know nor care not.      There's something sweet in my uncertainty      I would not change for your Chaldean lore;      Besides, I know of these all clay can know      Of aught above it, or below it--nothing.      I see their brilliancy and feel their beauty[m]--      When they shine on my grave I shall know neither.        _Bel._ For _neither_, Sire, say _better_.        _Sar._                                    I will wait,      If it so please you, Pontiff, for that knowledge.                  270      In the mean time receive your sword, and know      That I prefer your service militant      Unto your ministry--not loving either.        _Sal._ (_aside_). His lusts have made him mad. Then must I save him,      Spite of himself.        _Sar._            Please you to hear me, Satraps!      And chiefly thou, my priest, because I doubt thee      More than the soldier; and would doubt thee all      Wert thou not half a warrior: let us part      In peace--I'll not say pardon--which must be      Earned by the guilty; this I'll not pronounce ye,                  280      Although upon this breath of mine depends      Your own; and, deadlier for ye, on my fears.      But fear not--for that I am soft, not fearful--      And so live on. Were I the thing some think me,      Your heads would now be dripping the last drops      Of their attainted gore from the high gates      Of this our palace, into the dry dust,      Their only portion of the coveted kingdom      They would be crowned to reign o'er--let that pass.      As I have said, I will not _deem_ ye guilty,                       290      Nor _doom_ ye guiltless. Albeit better men      Than ye or I stand ready to arraign you;      And should I leave your fate to sterner judges,      And proofs of all kinds, I might sacrifice      Two men, who, whatsoe'er they now are, were      Once honest. Ye are free, sirs.        _Arb._                          Sire, this clemency----        _Bel._ (_interrupting him_).      Is worthy of yourself; and, although innocent,      We thank----        _Sar._      Priest! keep your thanksgivings for Belus;      His offspring needs none.        _Bel._                    But being innocent----        _Sar._ Be silent.--Guilt is loud. If ye are loyal,                 300      Ye are injured men, and should be sad, not grateful.        _Bel._ So we should be, were justice always done      By earthly power omnipotent; but Innocence      Must oft receive her right as a mere favour.        _Sar._ That's a good sentence for a homily,      Though not for this occasion. Prithee keep it      To plead thy Sovereign's cause before his people.        _Bel._ I trust there is no cause.        _Sar._                             No _cause_, perhaps;      But many causers:--if ye meet with such      In the exercise of your inquisitive function                       310      On earth, or should you read of it in heaven      In some mysterious twinkle of the stars,      Which are your chronicles, I pray you note,      That there are worse things betwixt earth and heaven      Than him who ruleth many and slays none;      And, hating not himself, yet loves his fellows      Enough to spare even those who would not spare him      Were they once masters--but that's doubtful. Satraps!      Your swords and persons are at liberty      To use them as ye will--but from this hour                         320      I have no call for either. Salemenes!      Follow me.

Yet he did it nobly;      Gave royally what we had forfeited      Basely----        _Bel._    Say bravely.        _Arb._                 Somewhat of both, perhaps--      But it has touched me, and, whate'er betide,                       340      I will no further on.        _Bel._                And lose the world!        _Arb._ Lose any thing except my own esteem.        _Bel._ I blush that we should owe our lives to such      A king of distaffs!        _Arb._              But no less we owe them;      And I should blush far more to take the grantor's![16]        _Bel._ Thou may'st endure whate'er thou wilt--the stars      Have written otherwise.        _Arb._                  Though they came down,      And marshalled me the way in all their brightness,      I would not follow.        _Bel._             This is weakness--worse      Than a scared beldam's dreaming of the dead,                       350      And waking in the dark.--Go to--go to.        _Arb._ Methought he looked like Nimrod as he spoke,      Even as the proud imperial statue stands      Looking the monarch of the kings around it,      And sways, while they but ornament, the temple.        _Bel._ I told you that you had too much despised him,      And that there was some royalty within him--What      then? he is the nobler foe.        _Arb._                     But we      The meaner.--Would"]]]
