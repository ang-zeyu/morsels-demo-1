I've often thought of it  since I was so cold and wet; and got to your camp-fire. \"The fire  of coals, and fish laid thereon, and bread,\" that's it.'    I read with a will, but rather sadly.    'That's it,' he said. 'It seems to bring back the fog, and going  to early Service past that coffee-stall, and the smell of that  shop next to the Surrey Arms.'    I thought of his homely comparison after I had left him for the  night. It moved me strangely. I read the letter he had lent me  the letter of Cecilia, who found the Berkshire moors so banal.  Yes, she promised to prove a very undesirable help-meet on the  veld, so far as I could judge. I thought over things generally  that night, and I made up my mind to make a Quixotic offer in the  morning. I would offer to take on Leonard's work. Let him go home  and be happy in his scented town, with his intolerantly urban (or  suburban) Cecilia. He was splendid stuff. He might do much,  surely, in that quaint atmosphere of light and locomotion and  fragrance that his sense of romance demanded. Here Cecilia would  surely be either impossible or a very great nuisance. While, even  without Cecilia, Leonard did not seem well suited in his sphere,  and I judged that he would soon be rotten with fever and wouldn't  last.    As for me, I liked country life much, and roughing it a little. I  had no particular fear of fever. I compared my physique with  Leonard's not without complacency. I thought of the other side,  too: the east country that village of all villages, those  villagers of all villagers.    But that night I was full of over-seas fervor. I remembered  phrases that had rung cut finely at meetings Outpost Duty, the  Church in Greater Britain, The White Man's Burden, In Darkest  Africa, etc., etc. When I fell asleep there seemed to be a  symphony in my ears sounding brass and tinkling cymbals enough  and to spare, but flute-voices of honest pity and sympathy as  well.    In the morning I took Leonard's place in his church. We had the  English Liturgy again. The thatched dome, with much tinier  windows than the windows at home, but much more sun to fill them,  seemed a sort of parable to me that morning. After I had finished  the rite, I stayed on in the church, and spread out two letters  before the Lord, so to speak. One was my schoolmaster's, the  other was that one from Cecilia.    It took me half an hour to feel fairly sure of my answer. But I  felt very sure then just as sure as I had been the night before  but the answer was different.    I thought of my own fold and flock as I read my own friend's  letter. How little the locum tenens seemed to see what I saw in  them! I read Cecilia's letter, and compared 'her view of the  importance of a country cure with my own. After all, I thought,  the latter tended to be an exceptional view in our megalomaniac  days. On the other hand, the locum tenens' view might be rather a  normal one, and so might Cecilia's be. Cecilia's scorn, it was,  that materially helped the answer to come as clearly as it did.  The thought of a Cecilia reigning in that east-country vicarage  seemed no more right than pleasant. It sounds a callous thing to  say, but I left my lonely and convalescent friend with something  of a sigh of relief, and no real misgiving. I felt troubled about  his future certainly, but I saw clearly that I was not meant to  take his place. I hoped to find the man who was meant to take it,  however.    And, by God's help, I believe that I really did find him before  many months were over.    A cousin of mine Richard East had been persuaded by a certain  bishop to accept an urban charge.    I fancy the said bishop had been reared in a rather strait school  of enthusiasts, who regarded work in slums as ideally the best  sphere for clerics of activity. So he had routed my cousin out of  his west-country village, and brought him to a big town--my  cousin, who was an outdoor man from his youth. Curiously enough,  at Cape Town, there was a letter waiting for me from him.  Wouldn't I tell him something about the 'great spaces washed with  sun'? The midland town in general seemed not to have gained his  affections, though he loved his people one by one. 'I want to  clear out,' he wrote, 'for the parish's sake more than for my  own, if only I can find the right place to clear to. I'm not  a townsman, and I think by now the bishop understands my  small-mindedness. I haven't the breadth of a good modern citizen.  I want to go to some Little Peddlington an African village might  suit me. No, directly the right man turns up, I don't doubt the  bishop will want to put him here in my room. Do you know of  anyone likely?' I did know of someone.    I did not write back; I got on my boat and started off for home.  I went down to the east country and set free the locum tenens.  The village had a bridal look for my eyes; the red-thorn tree was  just coming out, the roses would not be long now. I was in time  to be at our yearly May games after all. Next day I went to the  Midland town and saw my cousin; also, I saw his charge. I tried  to look at it with Leonard Reeve's eyes, recalling to my  remembrance that delirious night of his. Yes, though it was not  South London, it had a drab look on a dull June day. There was a  Warwick Arms, if no Surrey Arms. There was a shop with the  authentic fragrance only two or three doors off. I knew that  bishop, and I found him in, and in a listening mood, on the  following day. He wanted to hear about Africa. I described  missions and missionaries to him. Then I told him at some length  about Leonard Reeve.    'Yes, you have drawn the man convincingly,' he said. 'You didn't  invent those touches. I think he's a man after my own heart. I  don't understand you people that bury yourselves in little  rose-covered, immoral, earthy country villages. But I think I do  understand the man that you have described.' I went straight to  the point, and spoke of my cousin's parish. He agreed that my  cousin was a disappointment. 'He's got the same peddling way of  looking at things as you,' he said. 'I thought he'd flourish  after transplantation, but I admit he doesn't seem to. Yes, I  should think a desert and a barbarous people might suit him. I  don't deny that he has vision, but his sense of perspective seems  to be rather ridiculous.' I tried to arrange matters there and  then after that, but his lordship became politic, and seemed a  little afraid that he had said too much to me.    However, the business was on the way to be settled before I  parted from him. It has been settled quite a long while now. My  cousin, Richard East, now tramps the Kaffir paths and ministers  in the hill chapel and in that seven-domed church at the mission  station. I do not think that there is any Cecilia in his case,  nor that there is likely to be one. He personifies the abstract  too passionately to need the love of women.    Africa is personified to him the Cinderella of the continents,  the drudge with a destiny worthy of her charms and her good-temper.  He is writing a monograph on the Song of Solomon, he tells  me. He follows certain scholars in his conjecture that the  Shulamite was given back to a humble shepherd by Solomon, when  she had conquered the latter by the power of her impassioned  chastity. But he has his own theory as well that the true lovers  were both of African blood, that she came from the Ophir-land  south of the Zambesi, and thither returned in peace at last from  the foam of perilous seas. Perhaps his argument is slender; but  it is good for him to believe in it himself, I think, for surely  it helps his work among those that he deems her descendants.    He works on out there, personifying and idealizing. I think he  is as much in love with his country parish as I am with mine in  England. May we both, in our placid and unfashionable ways, dream  our dreams and see our visions! Meanwhile Leonard Reeve reigns  in that midland town, and is treasured by the bishop who was not  deceived when he expected a kindred spirit. He and Cecilia have  chosen a date in this next November for their deferred marriage.    Their choice of month seems to me characteristic. I do not think  they will be disappointed if the day is a little urban in its  murkiness.    It is good for a man to be in love with his charge, is it not?  Next time some fanatic of West-End work, or East-End work, or  foreign mission work gets hold of you and talks excellent sense  about discipline, and offering yourself to your bishop, and  packing up your kit at a week's notice remember this story of  mine!    Is it not well to import something of the precise devotion of  Holy Matrimony into the general self-oblation of Holy Orders?    It is good to think that three of us friends have the very same  sort of feeling Leonard Reeve for the crowds and the fogs and the  odors; my cousin for the rock-sown plains and the little circles  of thatched huts; I for the cornlands and the elm-shaded ridges  and the cottage people.    Yes, to Leonard anything grimy is just as romantic as green  fields to me, or brown veld to my cousin.    Do you know, I was asked to preach Leonard's Institution sermon  last Whit Monday, and I dared to preach it? Cecilia, who was  stately but really pleasant-looking, sat beneath me in the front  pew. Leonard, in his stall, looked oppressed with the weight of  the ceremony.    But his eyes lighted up, I saw, as I gave out my text. It was  from the end of St. John's Gospel. I preached very shortly. I  drew for that poor and earnest-looking congregation the picture  of a dripping missionary as I had seen him. I told of him going  about his business at dawn, cheered by the Easter Feast in front  at the chapel on the hill. I passed up to it by the cheery  camp-fire. I did not forget the smell of breakfast cooking, with  its reminder of home afterwards.    Then I spoke of the charm of the town work that Leonard had been "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22914"],[0,"The Sceptical Chymist (#9)"],[1,"Mass, and mingle  _per minima_, as they speak, whereas a much vehementer Fire will drive  or carry off the baser Metals (I mean the Lead, and the Copper or  other Alloy) from the Silver, though not, for ought appears, separate  them from one another. Besides, when a Vegetable abounding in fixt  Salt is analyz'd by a naked Fire, as one degree of Heat will reduce it  into Ashes, (as the Chymists themselves teach us) so, by only a  further degree of Fire, those Ashes may be vitrified and turn'd into  Glass. I will not stay to examine how far a meere Chymist might on  this occasion demand, If it be lawful for an _Aristotelian_ to make  Ashes, (which he mistakes for meere Earth) pass for an Element,  because by one degree of Fire it may be produc'd, why a Chymist may  not upon the like Principle argue, that Glass is one of the Elements  of many Bodies, because that also may be obtain'd from them, barely by  the Fire? I will not, I say, lose time to examine this, but observe,  that by a Method of applying the Fire, such similar Bodies may be  obtain'd from a Concrete, as Chymists have not been able to separate;  either by barely burning it in an open Fire, or by barely distilling  it in close Vessels. For to me it seems very considerable, and I  wonder that men have taken so little notice of it, that I have not by  any of the common wayes of Distillation in close Vessels, seen any  separation made of such a volatile Salt as is afforded us by Wood,  when that is first by an open Fire divided into Ashes and Soot, and  that Soot is afterwards plac'd in a strong Retort, and compell'd by an  urgent Fire to part with its Spirit, Oyl and Salt; for though I dare  not peremptorily deny, that in the Liquors of _Guajacum_ and other  Woods distill'd in Retorts after the common manner, there may be  Saline parts, which by reason of the Analogy may pretend to the name  of some kinde of volatile Salts; yet questionless there is a great  disparity betwixt such Salts and that which we have sometimes obtain'd  upon the first Distillation of Soot (though for the most part it has  not been separated from the first or second Rectification, and  sometimes not till the third) For we could never yet see separated  from Woods analyz'd only the vulgar way in close vessels any volatile  Salt in a dry and Saline form, as that of Soot, which we have often  had very Crystalline and Geometrically figur'd. And then, whereas the  Saline parts of the Spirits of _Guajacum_, &c. appear upon  distillation sluggish enough, the Salt of Soot seems to be one of the  most volatile Bodies in all Nature; and if it be well made will  readily ascend with the milde heat of a Furnace, warm'd only by the  single Wieck of a Lamp, to the top of the highest Glass Vessels that  are commonly made use of for Distillation: and besides all this, the  taste and smell of the Salt of Soot are exceeding differing from those  of the Spirits of _Guajacum_, &c. and the former not only smells and  tastes much less like a vegetable Salt, than like that of Harts-horn,  and other Animal Concretes; but in divers other Properties seems more  of Kinne to the Family of Animals, than to that of vegetable Salts, as  I may elsewhere (God permitting) have an occasion more particularly to  declare. I might likewise by some other Examples manifest, That the  Chymists, to have dealt clearly, ought to have more explicitly and  particularly declar'd by what Degree of Fire, and in what manner of  Application of it, they would have us Judge a Division made by the  Fire to be a true _Analysis_ into their Principles, and the  Productions of it to deserve the name of Elementary Bodies. But it is  time that I proceed to mention the particular Reasons that incline me  to Doubt, whether the Fire be the true and universal Analyzer of mixt  Bodies; of which Reasons what has been already objected may pass for  one.    In the next place I observe, That there are some mixt Bodies from  which it has not been yet made appear, that any degree of Fire can  separate either Salt or Sulphur or Mercury, much less all the Three.  The most obvious Instance of this Truth is Gold, which is a Body so  fix'd, and wherein the Elementary Ingredients (if it have any) are so  firmly united to each other, that we finde not in the operations  wherein Gold is expos'd to the Fire, how violent soever, that it does  discernably so much as lose of its fixednesse or weight, so far is it  from being dissipated into those Principles, whereof one at least is  acknowledged to be Fugitive enough; and so justly did the Spagyricall  Poet somewhere exclaim,         _Cuncta adeo miris illic compagibus harent._    And I must not omit on this occasion to mention to you, _Eleutherius_,  the memorable Experiment that I remember I met with in _Gasto  Claveus_,[2] who, though a Lawyer by Profession, seems to have had no  small Curiosity and Experience in Chymical affairs: He relates then,  that having put into one small Earthen Vessel an Ounce of the most  pure Gold, and into another the like weight of pure Silver, he plac'd  them both in that part of a Glass-house Furnace wherein the Workmen  keep their Metal, (as our English Artificers call their Liquid Glass)  continually melted, and that having there kept both the Gold and the  Silver in constant Fusion for two Moneths together, he afterwards took  them out of the Furnace and the Vessels, and weighing both of them  again, found that the Silver had not lost above a 12th part of its  weight, but the Gold had not of his lost any thing at all. And though  our Author endeavours to give us of this a Scholastick Reason, which I  suppose you would be as little satisfied with, as I was when I read  it; yet for the matter of Fact, which will serve our present turne, he  assures us, that though it be strange, yet Experience it self taught  it him to be most true.    [Footnote 2: _Gasto Claveus_ Apolog. Argur. & Chrysopera.]    And though there be not perhaps any other Body to be found so  perfectly fix'd as Gold, yet there are divers others so fix'd or  compos'd, at least of so strictly united parts, that I have not yet  observ'd the Fire to separate from them any one of the Chymists  Principles. I need not tell you what Complaints the more Candid and  Judicious of the Chymists themselves are wont to make of those  Boasters that confidently pretend, that they have extracted the Salt  or Sulphur of Quicksilver, when they have disguis'd it by Additaments,  wherewith it resembles the Concretes whose Names are given it;  whereas by a skilful and rigid _Examen_, it may be easily enough  stript of its Disguises, and made to appear again in the pristine form  of running Mercury. The pretended Salts and Sulphurs being so far from  being Elementary parts extracted out of the Bodie of Mercurie, that  they are rather (to borrow a terme of the Grammarians) De-compound  Bodies, made up of the whole Metal and the _Menstruum_ or other  Additaments imploy'd to disguise it. And as for Silver, I never could  see any degree of Fire make it part with any of its three Principles.  And though the Experiment lately mentioned from _Claveus_ may beget a  Suspition that Silver may be dissipated by Fire, provided it be  extreamly violent and very lasting: yet it will not necessarily  follow, that because the Fire was able at length to make the Silver  lose a little of its weight, it was therefore able to dissipate it  into its Principles. For first I might alledge that I have observ'd  little Grains of Silver to lie hid in the small Cavities (perhaps  glas'd over by a vitrifying heat) in Crucibles, wherein Silver has  been long kept in Fusion, whence some Goldsmiths of my Acquaintance  make a Benefit by grinding such Crucibles to powder, to recover out of  them the latent particles of Silver. And hence I might argue, that  perhaps _Claveus_ was mistaken, and imagin'd that Silver to have been  driven away by the Fire, that indeed lay in minute parts hid in his  Crucible, in whose pores so small a quantity as he mist of so  ponderous a Bodie might very well lie conceal'd.    But Secondly, admitting that some parts of the Silver were driven away  by the violence of the Fire, what proof is there that it was either  the Salt, the Sulphur, or the Mercury of the Metal, and not rather a  part of it homogeneous to what remain'd? For besides, that the Silver  that was left seem'd not sensibly alter'd, which probably would have  appear'd, had so much of any one of its Principles been separated from  it: We finde in other Mineral Bodies of a less permanent nature than  Silver, that the Fire may divide them into such minute parts, as to be  able to carry them away with its self, without at all destroying their  Nature. Thus we see that in the refining of Silver, the Lead that is  mix'd with it (to carry away the Copper or other ignoble Mineral that  embases the Silver) will, if it be let alone, in time evaporate away  upon the Test; but if (as is most usual amongst those that refine  great quantities of Metals together) the Lead be blown off from the  Silver by Bellowes, that which would else have gone away in the Form  of unheeded steams, will in great part be collected not far from the  Silver, in the Form of a darkish Powder or Calx, which, because it is  blown off from Silver, they call Litharge of Silver. And thus  _Agricola_[3] in divers places informs us, when Copper, or the Oare of  it is colliquated by the violence of the Fire with _Cadmia_, the  Sparks that in great multitudes do fly upwards do, some of them, stick  to the vaulted Roofs of the Furnaces, in the form of little and (for  the most part) White Bubbles, which therefore the Greeks, and, in  Imitation of them, our Drugsters call _Pompholix_: and others more  heavy partly adhere to the sides of the Furnace, and partly  (especially if the Covers be not kept upon the Pots) fall to the  Ground, and by reason of their Ashy Colour as well as Weight were  called by the same"]]]
