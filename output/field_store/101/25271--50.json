[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#9)"],[1,"meantime  let us try the tree.\"    This was agreed on; so we started off to a spot, not far distant, where  we knew of a tree that would suit us which grew near the water's edge.  As soon as we reached it Jack threw off his coat, and wielding the axe  with his sturdy arms, hacked and hewed at it for a quarter of an hour  without stopping.  Then he paused, and while he sat down to rest I  continued the work.  Then Peterkin made a vigorous attack on it; so that  when Jack renewed his powerful blows, a few minutes' cutting brought it  down with a terrible crash.    \"Hurrah!  Now for it!\" cried Jack.  \"Let us off with its head!\"    So saying, he began to cut through the stem again at about six yards  from the thick end.  This done, he cut three strong, short poles or  levers from the stout branches, with which to roll the log down the  beach into the sea; for, as it was nearly two feet thick at the large  end, we could not move it without such helps.  With the levers, however,  we rolled it slowly into the sea.    Having been thus successful in launching our vessel, we next shaped the  levers into rude oars or paddles, and then attempted to embark.  This  was easy enough to do; but after seating ourselves astride the log, it  was with the utmost difficulty we kept it from rolling round and  plunging us into the water.  Not that we minded that much; but we  preferred, if possible, to fish in dry clothes.  To be sure, our  trousers were necessarily wet, as our legs were dangling in the water on  each side of the log; but as they could be easily dried, we did not  care.  After half-an-hour's practice, we became expert enough to keep  our balance pretty steadily.  Then Peterkin laid down his paddle, and  having baited his line with a whole oyster, dropped it into deep water.    \"Now, then, Jack,\" said he, \"be cautious; steer clear o' that seaweed.  There! that's it; gently, now--gently.  I see a fellow at least a foot  long down there coming to--Ha! that's it!  Oh bother! he's off!\"    \"Did he bite?\" said Jack, urging the log onwards a little with his  paddle.    \"Bite?  Ay! he took it into his mouth, but the moment I began to haul he  opened his jaws and let it out again.\"    \"Let him swallow it next time,\" said Jack, laughing at the melancholy  expression of Peterkin's visage.    \"There he's again!\" cried Peterkin, his eyes flashing with excitement.  \"Look out!  Now, then!  No!  Yes!  No!  Why, the brute _won't_ swallow  it!\"    \"Try to haul him up by the mouth, then!\" cried Jack.  \"Do it gently.\"    A heavy sigh and a look of blank despair showed that poor Peterkin had  tried and failed again.    \"Never mind, lad,\" said Jack in a voice of sympathy; \"we'll move on and  offer it to some other fish.\"  So saying, Jack plied his paddle; but  scarcely had he moved from the spot when a fish with an enormous head  and a little body darted from under a rock and swallowed the bait at  once.    \"Got him this time--that's a fact!\" cried Peterkin, hauling in the line.  \"He's swallowed the bait right down to his tail, I declare!  Oh, what a  thumper!\"    As the fish came struggling to the surface we leaned forward to see it,  and overbalanced the log.  Peterkin threw his arms round the fish's  neck, and in another instant we were all floundering in the water!    A shout of laughter burst from us as we rose to the surface, like three  drowned rats, and seized hold of the log.  We soon recovered our  position, and sat more warily; while Peterkin secured the fish, which  had well-nigh escaped in the midst of our struggles.  It was little  worth having, however.  But, as Peterkin remarked, it was better than  the smouts he had been catching for the last two or three days; so we  laid it on the log before us, and having re-baited the line, dropped it  in again for another.    Now, while we were thus intent upon our sport, our attention was  suddenly attracted by a ripple on the sea, just a few yards away from  us.  Peterkin shouted to us to paddle in that direction, as he thought  it was a big fish and we might have a chance of catching it.  But Jack,  instead of complying, said, in a deep, earnest tone of voice, which I  never before heard him use, \"Haul up your line, Peterkin; seize your  paddle.  Quick--it's a shark!\"    The horror with which we heard this may well be imagined; for it must be  remembered that our legs were hanging down in the water, and we could  not venture to pull them up without upsetting the log.  Peterkin  instantly hauled up the line, and grasping his paddle, exerted himself  to the utmost, while we also did our best to make for shore.  But we  were a good way off, and the log being, as I have before said, very  heavy, moved but slowly through the water.  We now saw the shark quite  distinctly swimming round and round us, its sharp fin every now and then  protruding above the water.  From its active and unsteady motions, Jack  knew it was making up its mind to attack us; so he urged us vehemently  to paddle for our lives, while he himself set us the example.  Suddenly  he shouted, \"Look out! there he comes!\" and in a second we saw the  monstrous fish dive close under us and turn half-over on his side.  But  we all made a great commotion with our paddles, which, no doubt,  frightened it away for that time, as we saw it immediately after  circling round us as before.    \"Throw the fish to him!\" cried Jack in a quick, suppressed voice; \"we'll  make the shore in time yet if we can keep him off for a few minutes.\"    Peterkin stopped one instant to obey the command, and then plied his  paddle again with all his might.  No sooner had the fish fallen on the  water than we observed the shark to sink.  In another second we saw its  white breast rising; for sharks always turn over on their sides when  about to seize their prey, their mouths being not at the point of their  heads like those of other fish, but, as it were, under their chins.  In  another moment his snout rose above the water; his wide jaws, armed with  a terrific double row of teeth, appeared; the dead fish was engulfed,  and the shark sank out of sight.  But Jack was mistaken in supposing  that it would be satisfied.  In a very few minutes it returned to us,  and its quick motions led us to fear that it would attack us at once.    \"Stop paddling!\" cried Jack suddenly.  \"I see it coming up behind us.  Now, obey my orders _quickly_.  Our lives may depend on it.  Ralph--  Peterkin--do your best to _balance the log_.  Don't look out for the  shark.  Don't glance behind you.  Do nothing but balance the log.\"    Peterkin and I instantly did as we were ordered, being only too glad to  do anything that afforded us a chance or a hope of escape, for we had  implicit confidence in Jack's courage and wisdom.  For a few seconds,  that seemed long minutes to my mind, we sat thus silently; but I could  not resist glancing backward, despite the orders to the contrary.  On  doing so, I saw Jack sitting rigid like a statue, with his paddle  raised, his lips compressed, and his eyebrows bent over his eyes, which  glared savagely from beneath them down into the water.    I also saw the shark, to my horror, quite close under the log, in the  act of darting towards Jack's foot.  I could scarce suppress a cry on  beholding this.  In another moment the shark rose.  Jack drew his leg  suddenly from the water and threw it over the log.  The monster's snout  rubbed against the log as it passed, and revealed its hideous jaws, into  which Jack instantly plunged the paddle and thrust it down its throat.  So violent was this act that Jack rose to his feet in performing it; the  log was thereby rolled completely over, and we were once more plunged  into the water.  We all rose, spluttering and gasping, in a moment.    \"Now, then, strike out for shore!\" cried Jack.--\"Here, Peterkin, catch  hold of my collar, and kick out with a will!\"    Peterkin did as he was desired, and Jack struck out with such force that  he cut through the water like a boat; while I, being free from all  encumbrance, succeeded in keeping up with him.  As we had by this time  drawn pretty near to the shore, a few minutes more sufficed to carry us  into shallow water; and finally, we landed in safety, though very much  exhausted, and not a little frightened, by our terrible adventure.

Our encounter with the shark was the first great danger that had  befallen us since landing on this island; and we felt very seriously  affected by it, especially when we considered that we had so often  unwittingly incurred the same danger before while bathing.  We were now  forced to take to fishing again in the shallow water until we should  succeed in constructing a raft.  What troubled us most, however, was  that we were compelled to forego our morning swimming-excursions.  We  did, indeed, continue to enjoy our bathe in the shallow water; but Jack  and I found that one great source of our enjoyment was gone when we  could no longer dive down among the beautiful coral groves at the bottom  of the lagoon.  We had come to be so fond of this exercise, and to take  such an interest in watching the formations of coral and the gambols of  the many beautiful fish amongst the forest of red and green seaweeds,  that we had become quite familiar with the appearance of the fish and  the localities that they chiefly haunted.  We had also become expert  divers.  But we made it a rule never to stay long under water at a time.  Jack told me that to do so often was bad for the lungs, and instead of  affording us enjoyment, would ere"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21724"],[0,"The Handbook of Soap Manufacture (#9)"],[1,"been recommended from time to time,  including strontianite, lead oxide, caustic baryta, aluminium hydrate,  but none of these is of any practical importance.    _Soda and Potash._--Unlike the preceding bases, the soaps formed by soda  and potash are soluble in water, and constitute the soap of commerce.  These reagents are always used in sufficient quantity to combine with  the whole of the fatty acids contained in an oil or fat, though  doubtless, by the use of considerably smaller quantities, under  pressure, complete resolution of the fatty matter into fatty acids and  glycerol could be accomplished. They are, by far, the most important  saponifying agents from the point of view of the present work, and their  practical use is fully described in Chapter V.          CHAPTER III.    RAW MATERIALS USED IN SOAP-MAKING.         _Fats and Oils--Waste Fats--Fatty Acids--Less-known Oils and       Fats of Limited Use--Various New Fats and Oils Suggested for       Soap-making--Rosin--Alkali (Caustic and       Carbonated)--Water--Salt--Soap-stock._      _Fats and Oils._--All animal and vegetable oils and fats intended for  soap-making should be as free as possible from unsaponifiable matter, of  a good colour and appearance, and in a sweet, fresh condition. The  unsaponifiable matter naturally present as cholesterol, or phytosterol,  ranges in the various oils and fats from 0.2 to 2.0 per cent. All oils  and fats contain more or less free acidity; but excess of acidity,  though it may be due to the decomposition of the glyceride, and does not  always denote rancidity, is undesirable in soap-making material.  Rancidity of fats and oils is entirely due to oxidation, in addition to  free acid, aldehydes and ketones being formed, and it has been proposed  to estimate rancidity by determining the amount of these latter  produced. It is scarcely necessary to observe how very important it is  that the sampling of fats and oils should be efficiently performed, so  that the sample submitted to the chemist may be a fairly representative  average of the parcel.    In the following short description of the materials used, we give, under  each heading, figures for typical samples of the qualities most suitable  for soap-making.    _Tallows._--Most of the imported tallow comes from America, Australia  and New Zealand. South American mutton tallow is usually of good  quality; South American beef tallow is possessed of a deep yellow colour  and rather strong odour, but makes a bright soap of a good body and  texture. North American tallows are, as a general rule, much paler in  colour than those of South America, but do not compare with them in  consistence. Most of the Australasian tallows are of very uniform  quality and much in demand.    Great Britain produces large quantities of tallow which comes into the  market as town and country tallow, or home melt. Owing to the increasing  demand for edible fat, much of the rough fat is carefully selected,  rendered separately, and the product sold for margarine-making.  Consequently the melted tallow for soap-making is of secondary  importance to the tallow melter.    The following are typical samples of tallow:--     _______________________________________________________________________  |                                 |                |           |        |  |                                 |                |  Acidity  |        |  |                                 | Saponification | (as Oleic | Titre, |  |                                 |   Equivalent.  |   Acid)   | deg.C. |  |                                 |                | Per Cent. |        |  |_________________________________|________________|___________|________|  |                                 |                |           |        |  | Australian mutton               |     285        |   0.85    |  45    |  | Australian mutton               |     284.4      |   0.48    |  48.3  |  | Australian beef                 |     284.2      |   1.68    |  43.9  |  | Australian beef                 |     283.6      |   0.85    |  42.6  |  | Australian mixed                |     285.1      |   3.52    |  44    |  | Australian mixed                |     284.6      |   1.89    |  43.5  |  | South American mutton           |     284.5      |   1.11    |  47    |  | South American mutton           |     285        |   0.90    |  47.4  |  | South American beef             |     284.7      |   0.81    |  45    |  | South American beef             |     284        |   0.94    |  44    |  | North American mutton           |     284.3      |   1.32    |  44    |  | North American mutton           |      85        |   2.18    |  43.2  |  | North American beef, fine       |     284.5      |   1.97    |  41.5  |  | North American beef, good       |     283.8      |   4.30    |  42    |  | North American ordinary         |     285.2      |   5.07    |  41.75 |  | North American prime city       |     286        |   1.01    |  41.2  |  | Selected English mutton         |     283.9      |   1.45    |  47    |  | Selected English beef           |     284.2      |   2.40    |  44    |  | Home-rendered or country tallow |     284.6      |   5.1     |  43    |  | Town tallow                     |     285.3      |   7.4     |  42.5  |  |_________________________________|________________|___________|________|    Tallow should absorb from 39 to 44 per cent. iodine.    _Lard._--Lard is largely imported into this country from the United  States of America.

The dried kernels of the cocoa-nut are exported to various ports in  Europe, and the oil obtained comes on the market as Continental Coprah  Oil, with the prefix of the particular country or port where it has been  crushed, _e.g._, Belgian, French and Marseilles Coprah Oil. Coprah is  also imported into England, and the oil expressed from it is termed  English Pressed Coprah.

The fruit  of this tree yields the oil.    The free fatty acid content of olive oil varies very considerably. Very  fine oils contain less than 1 per cent. acidity; commercial oils may be  graded according to their free acidity, _e.g._, under 5 per cent., under  10 per cent., etc., and it entirely depends upon the desired price of  the resultant soap as to what grade would be used.
