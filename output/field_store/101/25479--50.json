They were thumping him by twos and threes and tens till his eyes turned  round and round. He could only gasp and point at Taffy.    'Where are the bad people who speared you, my darling?' said Teshumai  Tewindrow.    'There weren't any,' said Tegumai. 'My only visitor this morning was the  poor fellow that you are trying to choke. Aren't you well, or are you  ill, O Tribe of Tegumai?'    'He came with a horrible picture,' said the Head Chief,--'a picture that  showed you were full of spears.'    'Er-um-Pr'aps I'd better 'splain that I gave him that picture,' said  Taffy, but she did not feel quite comfy.    'You!' said the Tribe of Tegumai all together.  'Small-person-with-no-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked! You?'    'Taffy dear, I'm afraid we're in for a little trouble,' said her Daddy,  and put his arm round her, so she didn't care.    'Explain! Explain! Explain!' said the Head Chief of the Tribe of  Tegumai, and he hopped on one foot.    'I wanted the Stranger-man to fetch Daddy's spear, so I drawded it,'  said Taffy. 'There wasn't lots of spears. There was only one spear. I  drawded it three times to make sure. I couldn't help it looking as if it  stuck into Daddy's head--there wasn't room on the birch-bark; and those  things that Mummy called bad people are my beavers. I drawded them to  show him the way through the swamp; and I drawded Mummy at the mouth of  the Cave looking pleased because he is a nice Stranger-man, and I think  you are just the stupidest people in the world,' said Taffy. 'He is a  very nice man. Why have you filled his hair with mud? Wash him!'    Nobody said anything at all for a longtime, till the Head Chief laughed;  then the Stranger-man (who was at least a Tewara) laughed; then Tegumai  laughed till he fell down flat on the bank; then all the Tribe laughed  more and worse and louder. The only people who did not laugh were  Teshumai Tewindrow and all the Neolithic ladies. They were very polite  to all their husbands, and said 'Idiot!' ever so often.    Then the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai cried and said and sang, 'O  Small-person-with-out-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked, you've hit  upon a great invention!'    'I didn't intend to; I only wanted Daddy's black-handled spear,' said  Taffy.    'Never mind. It is a great invention, and some day men will call it  writing. At present it is only pictures, and, as we have seen to-day,  pictures are not always properly understood. But a time will come, O  Babe of Tegumai, when we shall make letters--all twenty-six of 'em,--and  when we shall be able to read as well as to write, and then we shall  always say exactly what we mean without any mistakes. Let the Neolithic  ladies wash the mud out of the stranger's hair.'    'I shall be glad of that,' said Taffy, 'because, after all, though  you've brought every single other spear in the Tribe of Tegumai, you've  forgotten my Daddy's black-handled spear.'    Then the Head Chief cried and said and sang, 'Taffy dear, the next time  you write a picture-letter, you'd better send a man who can talk our  language with it, to explain what it means. I don't mind it myself,  because I am a Head Chief, but it's very bad for the rest of the Tribe  of Tegumai, and, as you can see, it surprises the stranger.'    Then they adopted the Stranger-man (a genuine Tewara of Tewar) into the  Tribe of Tegumai, because he was a gentleman and did not make a fuss  about the mud that the Neolithic ladies had put into his hair. But  from that day to this (and I suppose it is all Taffy's fault), very few  little girls have ever liked learning to read or write. Most of them  prefer to draw pictures and play about with their Daddies--just like  Taffy.           THERE runs a road by Merrow Down--         A grassy track to-day it is       An hour out of Guildford town,         Above the river Wey it is.         Here, when they heard the horse-bells ring,         The ancient Britons dressed and rode       To watch the dark Phoenicians bring         Their goods along the Western Road.         And here, or hereabouts, they met         To hold their racial talks and such--       To barter beads for Whitby jet,         And tin for gay shell torques and such.         But long and long before that time         (When bison used to roam on it)       Did Taffy and her Daddy climb         That down, and had their home on it.         Then beavers built in Broadstone brook         And made a swamp where Bramley stands:       And bears from Shere would come and look         For Taffimai where Shamley stands.         The Wey, that Taffy called Wagai,         Was more than six times bigger then;       And all the Tribe of Tegumai         They cut a noble figure then!          HOW THE ALPHABET WAS MADE    THE week after Taffimai Metallumai (we will still call her Taffy,  Best Beloved) made that little mistake about her Daddy's spear and the  Stranger-man and the picture-letter and all, she went carp-fishing again  with her Daddy. Her Mummy wanted her to stay at home and help hang up  hides to dry on the big drying-poles outside their Neolithic Cave,  but Taffy slipped away down to her Daddy quite early, and they fished.  Presently she began to giggle, and her Daddy said, 'Don't be silly,  child.'    'But wasn't it inciting!' said Taffy. 'Don't you remember how the Head  Chief puffed out his cheeks, and how funny the nice Stranger-man looked  with the mud in his hair?'    'Well do I,' said Tegumai. 'I had to pay two deerskins--soft ones with  fringes--to the Stranger-man for the things we did to him.'    'We didn't do anything,' said Taffy. 'It was Mummy and the other  Neolithic ladies--and the mud.'    'We won't talk about that,' said her Daddy, 'Let's have lunch.'    Taffy took a marrow-bone and sat mousy-quiet for ten whole minutes,  while her Daddy scratched on pieces of birch-bark with a shark's tooth.  Then she said, 'Daddy, I've thinked of a secret surprise. You make a  noise--any sort of noise.'    'Ah!' said Tegumai. 'Will that do to begin with?'    'Yes,' said Taffy. 'You look just like a carp-fish with its mouth open.  Say it again, please.'    'Ah! ah! ah!' said her Daddy. 'Don't be rude, my daughter.'    'I'm not meaning rude, really and truly,' said Taffy. 'It's part of my  secret-surprise-think. Do say ah, Daddy, and keep your mouth open at  the end, and lend me that tooth. I'm going to draw a carp-fish's mouth  wide-open.'    'What for?' said her Daddy.    'Don't you see?' said Taffy, scratching away on the bark. 'That will be  our little secret s'prise. When I draw a carp-fish with his mouth open  in the smoke at the back of our Cave--if Mummy doesn't mind--it will  remind you of that ah-noise. Then we can play that it was me jumped  out of the dark and s'prised you with that noise--same as I did in the  beaver-swamp last winter.'    'Really?' said her Daddy, in the voice that grown-ups use when they are  truly attending. 'Go on, Taffy.'    'Oh bother!' she said. 'I can't draw all of a carp-fish, but I can draw  something that means a carp-fish's mouth. Don't you know how they stand  on their heads rooting in the mud? Well, here's a pretence carp-fish (we  can play that the rest of him is drawn). Here's just his mouth, and that  means ah.' And she drew this. (1.)    'That's not bad,' said Tegumai, and scratched on his own piece of bark  for himself; but you've forgotten the feeler that hangs across his  mouth.'    'But I can't draw, Daddy.'    'You needn't draw anything of him except just the opening of his mouth  and the feeler across. Then we'll know he's a carp-fish, 'cause the  perches and trouts haven't got feelers. Look here, Taffy.' And he drew  this. (2.)    'Now I'll copy it.' said Taffy. 'Will you understand this when you see  it?'    'Perfectly,' said her Daddy.    And she drew this. (3.) 'And I'll be quite as s'prised when I see it  anywhere, as if you had jumped out from behind a tree and said '\"Ah!\"'    'Now, make another noise,' said Taffy, very proud.    'Yah!' said her Daddy, very loud.    'H'm,' said Taffy. 'That's a mixy noise. The end part is  ah-carp-fish-mouth; but what can we do about the front part? Yer-yer-yer  and ah! Ya!'    'It's very like the carp-fish-mouth noise. Let's draw another bit of the  carp-fish and join 'em,' said her Daddy. He was quite incited too.    'No. If they're joined, I'll forget. Draw it separate. Draw his tail.  If he's standing on his head the tail will come first. 'Sides, I think I  can draw tails easiest,' said Taffy.    'A good notion,' said Tegumai. 'Here's a carp-fish tail for the  yer-noise.' And he drew this. (4.)    'I'll try now,' said Taffy. ''Member I can't draw like you, Daddy. Will  it do if I just draw the split part of the tail, and the sticky-down  line for where it joins?' And she drew this. (5.)    Her Daddy nodded, and his eyes were shiny bright with 'citement.    'That's beautiful,' she said. 'Now make another noise, Daddy.'    'Oh!' said her Daddy, very loud.    'That's quite easy,' said Taffy. 'You make your mouth all around like an  egg or a stone. So an egg or a stone will do for that.'    'You can't always find eggs or stones. We'll have to scratch a round  something like one.' And he drew this. (6.)    'My gracious!' said Taffy, 'what a lot of noise-pictures we've  made,--carp-mouth, carp-tail, and egg! Now, make another noise, Daddy.'    'Ssh!' said her Daddy, and frowned to himself, but Taffy was too incited  to notice.    'That's quite easy,' she said, scratching on the bark.    'Eh, what?' said her Daddy. 'I meant I was thinking, and didn't want to  be disturbed.'    'It's a noise just the same. It's the noise a snake makes, Daddy,  when it is thinking and doesn't want to be disturbed. Let's make the  ssh-noise a snake. Will this do?' And she drew this. (7.)    'There,' she said. 'That's another s'prise-secret. When you draw a  hissy-snake by the door of your little back-cave where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27827"],[0,"The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (#9)"],[1,"a man and woman who  have come together is of four kinds, viz.:       Touching.     Piercing.     Rubbing.     Pressing.    The action in each case is denoted by the meaning of the word which  stands for it.    (1). When a man under some pretext or other goes in front or alongside  of a woman and touches her body with his own, it is called the \"touching  embrace.\"    (2). When a woman in a lonely place bends down, as if to pick up  something, and pierces, as it were, a man sitting or standing, with her  breasts, and the man in return takes hold of them, it is called a  \"piercing embrace.\"    The above two kinds of embrace takes place only between persons who do  not, as yet, speak freely with each other.    (3). When two lovers are walking slowly together, either in the dark, or  in a place of public resort, or in a lonely place, and rub their bodies  against each other, it is called a \"rubbing embrace.\"    (4). When on the above occasion one of them presses the other's body  forcibly against a wall or pillar, it is called a \"pressing embrace.\"    These two last embraces are peculiar to those who know the intentions of  each other.    At the time of the meeting the four following kinds of embrace are used,  viz.:    _Jataveshtitaka_, or the twining of a creeper.    _Vrikshadhirudhaka_, or climbing a tree.    _Tila-Tandulaka_, or the mixture of sesamum seed with rice.    _Kshiraniraka_, or milk and water embrace.    (1). When a woman, clinging to a man as a creeper twines round a tree,  bends his head down to hers with the desire of kissing him and slightly  makes the sound of sut sut, embraces him, and looks lovingly towards  him, it is called an embrace like the \"twining of a creeper.\"    (2). When a woman, having placed one of her feet on the foot of her  lover, and the other on one of his thighs, passes one of her arms round  his back, and the other on his shoulders, makes slightly the sounds of  singing and cooing, and wishes, as it were, to climb up him in order to  have a kiss, it is called an embrace like the \"climbing of a tree.\"    These two kinds of embrace take place when the lover is standing.    (3). When lovers lie on a bed, and embrace each other so closely that  the arms and thighs of the one are encircled by the arms and thighs of  the other, and are, as it were, rubbing up against them, this is called  an embrace like \"the mixture of sesamum seed with rice.\"    (4). When a man and a woman are very much in love with each other, and  not thinking of any pain or hurt, embrace each other as if they were  entering into each other's bodies, either while the woman is sitting on  the lap of the man or in front of him, or on a bed, then it is called an  embrace like a \"mixture of milk and water.\"    These two kinds of embrace take place at the time of sexual union.    Babhravya has thus related to us the above eight kinds of embraces.    Suvarnanabha, moreover, gives us four ways of embracing simple members  of the body, which are:    The embrace of the thighs.    The embrace of the jaghana, _i.e._, the part of the body from the navel  downwards to the thighs.    The embrace of the breasts.    The embrace of the forehead.    (1). When one of two lovers presses forcibly one or both of the thighs  of the other between his or her own, it is called the \"embrace of  thighs.\"    (2). When a man presses the jaghana or middle part of the woman's body  against his own, and mounts upon her to practise, either scratching with  the nail or finger, or biting, or striking, or kissing, the hair of the  woman being loose and flowing, it is called the \"embrace of the  jaghana.\"    (3). When a man places his breast between the breasts of a woman, and  presses her with it, it is called the \"embrace of the breasts.\"    (4). When either of the lovers touches the mouth, the eyes and the  forehead of the other with his or her own, it is called the \"embrace of  the forehead.\"    Some say that even shampooing is a kind of embrace, because there is a  touching of bodies in it. But Vatsyayana thinks that shampooing is  performed at a different time, and for a different purpose, and it is  also of a different character, it cannot be said to be included in the  embrace.    There are also some verses on the subject as follows: \"The whole subject  of embracing is of such a nature that men who ask questions about it, or  who hear about it, or who talk about it, acquire thereby a desire for  enjoyment. Even those embraces that are not mentioned in the Kama  Shastra should be practised at the time of sexual enjoyment, if they are  in any way conducive to the increase of love or passion. The rules of  the Shastra apply so long as the passion of man is middling, but when  the wheel of love is once set in motion, there is then no Shastra and no  order.\"          CHAPTER III.    ON KISSING.      It is said by some that there is no fixed time or order between the  embrace, the kiss, and the pressing or scratching with the nails or  fingers, but that all these things should be done generally before  sexual union takes place, while striking and making the various sounds  generally takes place at the time of the union. Vatsyayana, however,  thinks that anything may take place at any time, for love does not care  for time or order.    On the occasion of the first congress, kissing and the other things  mentioned above should be done moderately, they should not be continued  for a long time, and should be done alternately. On subsequent  occasions, however, the reverse of all this may take place, and  moderation will not be necessary, they may continue for a long time, and  for the purpose of kindling love, they may be all done at the same time.    The following are the places for kissing, viz., the forehead, the eyes,  the cheeks, the throat, the bosom, the breasts, the lips, and the  interior of the mouth. Moreover, the people of the Lat country kiss also  on the following places, viz., the joints of the thighs, the arms, and  the navel. But Vatsyayana thinks that though kissing is practised by  these people in the above places on account of the intensity of their  love, and the customs of their country, it is not fit to be practised by  all.    Now in a case of a young girl there are three sort of kisses, viz.:       The nominal kiss.     The throbbing kiss.     The touching kiss.    (1). When a girl only touches the mouth of her lover with her own, but  does not herself do anything, it is called the \"nominal kiss.\"    (2). When a girl, setting aside her bashfulness a little, wishes to  touch the lip that is pressed into her mouth, and with that object  moves her lower lip, but not the upper one, it is called the \"throbbing  kiss.\"    (3). When a girl touches her lover's lip with her tongue, and having  shut her eyes, places her hands on those of her lover, it is called the  \"touching kiss.\"    Other authors describe four other kinds of kisses, viz.:       The straight kiss.     The bent kiss.     The turned kiss.     The pressed kiss.    (1). When the lips of two lovers are brought into direct contact with  each other, it is called a \"straight kiss.\"    (2). When the heads of two lovers are bent towards each other, and when  so bent kissing takes place, it is called a \"bent kiss.\"    (3). When one of them turns up the face of the other by holding the head  and chin, and then kissing, it is called a \"turned kiss.\"    (4). Lastly, when the lower lip is pressed with much force, it is called  a \"pressed kiss.\"    There is also a fifth kind of kiss called the \"greatly pressed kiss,\"  which is effected by taking hold of the lower lip between two fingers,  and then after touching it with the tongue, pressing it with great force  with the lip.    As regards kissing, a wager may be laid as to which will get hold of the  lips of the other first. If the woman loses, she should pretend to cry,  should keep her lover off by shaking her hands, and turn away from him  and dispute with him, saying \"let another wager be laid.\" If she loses  this a second time, she should appear doubly distressed, and when her  lover is off his guard or asleep, she should get hold of his lower lip,  and hold it in her teeth, so that it should not slip away, and then she  should laugh, make a loud noise, deride him, dance about, and say  whatever she likes in a joking way, moving her eyebrows, and rolling her  eyes. Such are the wagers and quarrels as far as kissing is concerned,  but the same may be applied with regard to the pressing or scratching  with the nails and fingers, biting and striking. All these, however, are  only peculiar to men and women of intense passion.    When a man kisses the upper lip of a woman, while she in return kisses  his lower lip, it is called the \"kiss of the upper lip.\"    When one of them takes both the lips of the other between his or her  own, it is called \"a clasping kiss.\" A woman, however, only takes this  kind of kiss from a man who has no moustache. And on the occasion of  this kiss, if one of them touches the teeth, the tongue, and the palate  of the other, with his or her tongue, it is called the \"fighting of the  tongue.\" In the same way, the pressing of the teeth of the one against  the mouth of the other is to be practised.    Kissing is of four kinds, viz., moderate, contracted, pressed, and soft,  according to the different parts of the body which are kissed, for  different kinds of kisses are appropriate for different parts of the  body.    When a woman looks at the face of her lover while he is asleep, and  kisses it to show her intention or desire, it is called a \"kiss that  kindles love.\"    When a woman kisses her lover while he is engaged in business, or while  he is quarrelling with her, or while he is looking at something else, so  that his mind may be turned away, it is called a \"kiss that turns away.\"    When a lover coming home late at night kisses his beloved, who is asleep  or in bed, in order to show her his"]]]
