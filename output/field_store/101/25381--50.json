Some courtiers of less note succeeded in  extorting smaller sums. The unhappy man had spirit enough to feel keenly  the degradation to which he had stooped. He survived the day of his  ignominy several years. He lived to see his party triumphant, to be once  more an important member of it, to rise high in the state, and to make  his persecutors tremble in their turn. But his prosperity was embittered  by one insupportable recollection. He never regained his cheerfulness,  and at length died by his own hand. [39]    That Delamere, if he had needed the royal mercy, would have found it is  not very probable. It is certain that every advantage which the letter  of the law gave to the government was used against him without scruple  or shame. He was in a different situation from that in which Stamford  stood. The indictment against Stamford had been removed into the House  of Lords during the session of Parliament, and therefore could not be  prosecuted till the Parliament should reassemble. All the peers would  then have voices, and would be judges as well of law as of fact. But the  bill against Delamere was not found till after the prorogation. [40]  He was therefore within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Lord High  Steward. This court, to which belongs, during a recess of Parliament,  the cognizance of treasons and felonies committed by temporal peers, was  then so constituted that no prisoner charged with a political offence  could expect an impartial trial. The King named a Lord High Steward.  The Lord High Steward named, at his discretion, certain peers to sit  on their accused brother. The number to be summoned was indefinite. No  challenge was allowed. A simple majority, provided that it consisted of  twelve, was sufficient to convict. The High Steward was sole judge of  the law; and the Lords Triers formed merely a jury to pronounce on  the question of fact. Jeffreys was appointed High Steward. He selected  thirty Triers; and the selection was characteristic of the man and of  the times. All the thirty were in politics vehemently opposed to the  prisoner. Fifteen of them were colonels of regiments, and might be  removed from their lucrative commands at the pleasure of the King. Among  the remaining fifteen were the Lord Treasurer, the principal Secretary  of State, the Steward of the Household, the Comptroller of the  Household, the Captain of the Band of Gentlemen Pensioners, the Queen's  Chamberlain, and other persons who were bound by strong ties of interest  to the court. Nevertheless, Delamere had some great advantages over the  humbler culprits who had been arraigned at the Old Bailey. There the  jurymen, violent partisans, taken for a single day by courtly Sheriffs  from the mass of society and speedily sent back to mingle with that  mass, were under no restraint of shame, and being little accustomed to  weigh evidence, followed without scruple the directions of the bench.  But in the High Steward's Court every Trier was a man of some experience  in grave affairs. Every Trier filled a considerable space in the public  eye. Every Trier, beginning from the lowest, had to rise separately and  to give in his verdict, on his honour, before a great concourse. That  verdict, accompanied with his name, would go to every part of the world,  and would live in history. Moreover, though the selected nobles were  all Tories, and almost all placemen, many of them had begun to look with  uneasiness on the King's proceedings, and to doubt whether the case of  Delamere might not soon be their own.    Jeffreys conducted himself, as was his wont, insolently and unjustly.  He had indeed an old grudge to stimulate his zeal. He had been Chief  Justice of Chester when Delamere, then Mr. Booth, represented that  county in Parliament. Booth had bitterly complained to the Commons that  the dearest interests of his constituents were intrusted to a drunken  jackpudding. [41] The revengeful judge was now not ashamed to resort  to artifices which even in an advocate would have been culpable. He  reminded the Lords Triers, in very significant language, that Delamere  had, in Parliament, objected to the bill for attainting Monmouth, a  fact which was not, and could not be, in evidence. But it was not in  the power of Jeffreys to overawe a synod of peers as he had been in  the habit of overawing common juries. The evidence for the crown would  probably have been thought amply sufficient on the Western Circuit or  at the City Sessions, but could not for a moment impose on such men  as Rochester, Godolphin, and Churchill; nor were they, with all their  faults, depraved enough to condemn a fellow creature to death against  the plainest rules of justice. Grey, Wade, and Goodenough were produced,  but could only repeat what they had heard said by Monmouth and by  Wildman's emissaries. The principal witness for the prosecution, a  miscreant named Saxton, who had been concerned in the rebellion, and  was now labouring to earn his pardon by swearing against all who were  obnoxious to the government, who proved by overwhelming evidence to  have told a series of falsehoods. All the Triers, from Churchill who,  as junior baron, spoke first, up to the Treasurer, pronounced, on their  honour, that Delamere was not guilty. The gravity and pomp of the whole  proceeding made a deep impression even on the Nuncio, accustomed as  he was to the ceremonies of Rome, ceremonies which, in solemnity and  splendour, exceed all that the rest of the world can show. [42]  The King, who was present, and was unable to complain of a decision  evidently just, went into a rage with Saxton, and vowed that the wretch  should first be pilloried before Westminster Hall for perjury, and then  sent down to the West to be hanged, drawn, and quartered for treason.  [43]    The public joy at the acquittal of Delamere was great. The reign  of terror was over. The innocent began to breathe freely, and false  accusers to tremble. One letter written on this occasion is scarcely to  be read without tears. The widow of Russell, in her retirement, learned  the good news with mingled feelings. \"I do bless God,\" she wrote, \"that  he has caused some stop to be put to the shedding of blood in this poor  land. Yet when I should rejoice with them that do rejoice, I seek a  corner to weep in. I find I am capable of no more gladness; but every  new circumstance, the very comparing my night of sorrow after such a  day, with theirs of joy, does, from a reflection of one kind or another,  rack my uneasy mind. Though I am far from wishing the close of theirs  like mine, yet I cannot refrain giving some time to lament mine was not  like theirs.\" [44]    And now the tide was on the turn. The death of Stafford, witnessed with  signs of tenderness and remorse by the populace to whose rage he was  sacrificed, marks the close of one proscription. The acquittal of  Delamere marks the close of another. The crimes which had disgraced the  stormy tribuneship of Shaftesbury had been fearfully expiated. The blood  of innocent Papists had been avenged more than tenfold by the blood of  zealous Protestants. Another great reaction had commenced. Factions  were fast taking new forms. Old allies were separating. Old enemies  were uniting. Discontent was spreading fast through all the ranks of  the party lately dominant. A hope, still indeed faint and indefinite,  of victory and revenge, animated the party which had lately seemed to be  extinct. Amidst such circumstances the eventful and troubled year 1685  terminated, and the year 1686 began.    The prorogation had relieved the King from the gentle remonstrances  of the Houses: but he had still to listen to remonstrances, similar in  effect, though uttered in a tone even more cautious and subdued. Some  men who had hitherto served him but too strenuously for their own fame  and for the public welfare had begun to feel painful misgivings, and  occasionally ventured to hint a small part of what they felt.    During many years the zeal of the English Tory for hereditary monarchy  and his zeal for the established religion had grown up together and  had strengthened each other. It had never occurred to him that the two  sentiments, which seemed inseparable and even identical, might one day  be found to be not only distinct but incompatible. From the commencement  of the strife between the Stuarts and the Commons, the cause of the  crown and the cause of the hierarchy had, to all appearance, been one.  Charles the First was regarded by the Church as her martyr. If Charles  the Second had plotted against her, he had plotted in secret. In public  he had ever professed himself her grateful and devoted son, had knelt  at her altars, and, in spite of his loose morals, had succeeded in  persuading the great body of her adherents that he felt a sincere  preference for her. Whatever conflicts, therefore, the honest Cavalier  might have had to maintain against Whigs and Roundheads he had at least  been hitherto undisturbed by conflict in his own mind. He had seen the  path of duty plain before him. Through good and evil he was to be true  to Church and King. But, if those two august and venerable powers, which  had hitherto seemed to be so closely connected that those who were true  to one could not be false to the other, should be divided by a deadly  enmity, what course was the orthodox Royalist to take? What situation  could be more trying than that in which he would be placed, distracted  between two duties equally sacred, between two affections equally  ardent? How was he to give to Caesar all that was Caesar's, and yet to  withhold from God no part of what was God's? None who felt thus could  have watched, without deep concern and gloomy forebodings, the dispute  between the King and the Parliament on the subject of the test. If James  could even now be induced to reconsider his course, to let"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#9)"],[1,"yesterday--'De Jure inter  Gentes'--published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles'  head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed  volume was struck off.\"    \"Who is the printer?\"    \"Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very  faded ink, is written 'Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.' I wonder who William  Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His  writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.\"    As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose  softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the  servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she  opened it.    \"Does Dr. Watson live here?\" asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We  could not hear the servant's reply, but the door closed, and some one  began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling  one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he  listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble  tap at the door.    \"Come in,\" I cried.    At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very  old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be  dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she  stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket  with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face  had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to  keep my countenance.    The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our  advertisement. \"It's this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\" she said,  dropping another curtsey; \"a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It  belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,  which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he'd say if  he come 'ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he  being short enough at the best o' times, but more especially when he  has the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along  with----\"    \"Is that her ring?\" I asked.    \"The Lord be thanked!\" cried the old woman; \"Sally will be a glad woman  this night. That's the ring.\"    \"And what may your address be?\" I inquired, taking up a pencil.    \"13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.\"    \"The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,\" said  Sherlock Holmes sharply.    The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little  red-rimmed eyes. \"The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,\" she said.  \"Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.\"    \"And your name is----?\"    \"My name is Sawyer--her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her--and  a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the  company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what  with liquor shops----\"    \"Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\" I interrupted, in obedience to a sign  from my companion; \"it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad  to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.\"    With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone  packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock  Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into  his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and  a cravat. \"I'll follow her,\" he said, hurriedly; \"she must be an  accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.\" The hall door had  hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair.  Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the  other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.  \"Either his whole theory is incorrect,\" I thought to myself, \"or else he  will be led now to the heart of the mystery.\" There was no need for him  to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until  I heard the result of his adventure.    It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might  be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages  of Henri Murger's \"Vie de Boheme.\" Ten o'clock passed, and I heard the  footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the  more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same  destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of  his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not  been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the  mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a  hearty laugh.    \"I wouldn't have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\" he cried,  dropping into his chair; \"I have chaffed them so much that they would  never have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I  know that I will be even with them in the long run.\"    \"What is it then?\" I asked.    \"Oh, I don't mind telling a story against myself. That creature had  gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being  foot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which  was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but  I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to  be heard at the other side of the street, 'Drive to 13, Duncan Street,  Houndsditch,' she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and  having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That's an art  which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and  never drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off  before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy,  lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw  him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When  I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and  giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I  listened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it  will be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13  we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named  Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever  been heard of there.\"    \"You don't mean to say,\" I cried, in amazement, \"that that tottering,  feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,  without either you or the driver seeing her?\"    \"Old woman be damned!\" said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \"We were the old  women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an  active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was  inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means  of giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as  lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk  something for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice  and turn in.\"    I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I  left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the  watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin,  and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he  had set himself to unravel.          CHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.      THE papers next day were full of the \"Brixton Mystery,\" as they termed  it. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it  in addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I  still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing  upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--    The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had  seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German  name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister  inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political  refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in  America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws,  and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht,  aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian  theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the  article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer  watch over foreigners in England.    The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort  usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the  unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening  of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had  been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the  boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.  He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph  Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the  4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of  catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon  the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber's body  was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,  many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are  questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the  whereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and  Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it  is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily  throw light upon the matter.    The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being  a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which"]]]
