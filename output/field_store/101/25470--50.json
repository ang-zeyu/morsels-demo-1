Her agitation, however, did not escape the notice of  the marchioness, who the next day had horses put to her coach and  retired to hey estate of Lavoine. This clumsy proceeding strengthened  suspicion.    The first determination of the countess was to arrest Louise Goillard;  but she saw that in so serious a matter every step must be taken with  precaution. She consulted the count and the countess dowager. They  quietly summoned the midwife, to question her without any preliminaries.  She prevaricated and contradicted herself over and over again; moreover,  her state of terror alone sufficed to convict her of a crime. They  handed her over to the law, and the Count de Saint-Geran filed an  information before the vice-seneschal of Moulins.    The midwife underwent a first interrogatory. She confessed the truth of  the accouchement, but she added that the countess had given birth to a  still-born daughter, which she had buried under a stone near the step of  the barn in the back yard. The judge, accompanied by a physician and a  surgeon, repaired to the place, where he found neither stone, nor  foetus, nor any indications of an interment. They searched  unsuccessfully in other places.    When the dowager countess heard this statement, she demanded that this  horrible woman should be put on her trial. The civil lieutenant, in the  absence of the criminal lieutenant, commenced the proceedings.    In a second interrogation, Louise Goillard positively declared that the  countess had never been confined;    In a third, that she had been delivered of a mole;    In a fourth, that she had been confined of a male infant, which Baulieu  had carried away in a basket;    And in a fifth, in which she answered from the dock, she maintained that  her evidence of the countess's accouchement had been extorted from her  by violence. She made no charges against either Madame de Bouille or the  Marquis de Saint Maixent. On the other hand, no sooner was she under  lock and key than she despatched her son Guillemin to the marchioness to  inform her that she was arrested. The marchioness recognised how  threatening things were, and was in a state of consternation; she  immediately sent the sieur de la Foresterie, her steward, to the  lieutenant-general, her counsel, a mortal enemy of the count, that he  might advise her in this conjuncture, and suggest a means for helping  the matron without appearing openly in the matter. The lieutenant's  advice was to quash the proceedings and obtain an injunction against the  continuance of the preliminaries to the action. The marchioness spent a  large sum of money, and obtained this injunction; but it was immediately  reversed, and the bar to the suit removed.    La Foresterie was then ordered to pass to Riom, where the sisters Quinet  lived, and to bribe them heavily to secrecy. The elder one, on leaving  the marchioness's service, had shaken her fist in her face, feeling  secure with the secrets in her knowledge, and told her that she would  repent having dismissed her and her sister, and that she would make a  clean breast of the whole affair, even were she to be hung first. These  girls then sent word that they wished to enter her service again; that  the countess had promised them handsome terms if they would speak; and  that they had even been questioned in her name by a Capuchin superior,  but that they said nothing, in order to give time to prepare an answer  for them. The marchioness found herself obliged to take back the girls;  she kept the younger, and married the elder to Delisle, her house  steward. But la Foresterie, finding himself in this network of intrigue,  grew disgusted at serving such a mistress, and left her house. The  marchioness told him on his departure that if he were so indiscreet as  to repeat a word of what he had learned from the Quinet girls, she would  punish him with a hundred poniard stabs from her major-domo Delisle.  Having thus fortified her position, she thought herself secure against  any hostile steps; but it happened that a certain prudent Berger,  gentleman and page to the Marquis de Saint-Maixent, who enjoyed his  master's confidence and went to see him in the Conciergerie, where he  was imprisoned, threw some strange light on this affair. His master had  narrated to him all the particulars of the accouchement of the countess  and of the abduction of the child.    \"I am astonished, my lord,\" replied the page, \"that having so many  dangerous affairs on hand; you did not relieve your conscience of this  one.\"    \"I intend,\" replied the marquis, \"to restore this child to his father: I  have been ordered to do so by a Capuchin to whom I confessed having  carried off from the midst of the family, without their knowing it, a  grandson of a marshal of France and son of a governor of a province.\"    The marquis had at that time permission to go out from prison  occasionally on his parole. This will not surprise anyone acquainted  with the ideas which prevailed at that period on the honour of a  nobleman, even the greatest criminal. The marquis, profiting by this  facility, took the page to see a child of about seven years of age, fair  and with a beautiful countenance.    \"Page,\" said he, \"look well at this child, so that you may know him  again when I shall send you to inquire about him.\"    He then informed him that this was the Count de Saint-Geran's son whom  he had carried away.    Information of these matters coming to the ears of justice, decisive  proofs were hoped for; but this happened just when other criminal  informations were lodged against the marquis, which left him helpless to  prevent the exposure of his crimes. Police officers were despatched in  all haste to the Conciergerie; they were stopped by the gaolers, who  told them that the marquis, feeling ill, was engaged with a priest who  was administering the sacraments, to him. As they insisted on seeing  him; the warders approached the cell: the priest came out, crying that  persons must be sought to whom the sick man had a secret to reveal; that  he was in a desperate state, and said he had just poisoned himself; all  entered the cell.      M. de Saint-Maixent was writhing on a pallet, in a pitiable condition,       sometimes shrieking like a wild beast, sometimes stammering       disconnected words. All that the officers could hear was--    \"Monsieur le Comte . . . call . . . the Countess . . . de Saint-Geran .  . . let them come. . . .\" The officers earnestly begged him to try to be  more explicit.    The marquis had another fit; when he opened his eyes, he said--    \"Send for the countess . . . let them forgive me . . . I wish to tell  them everything.\" The police officers asked him to speak; one even told  him that the count was there. The marquis feebly murmured--    \"I am going to tell you----\" Then he gave a loud cry and fell back dead.    It thus seemed as if fate took pains to close every mouth from which the  truth might escape. Still, this avowal of a deathbed revelation to be  made to the Count de Saint-Geran and the deposition of the priest who  had administered the last sacraments formed a strong link in the chain  of evidence.    The judge of first instruction, collecting all the information he had  got, made a report the weight of which was overwhelming. The carters,  the nurse, the domestic servants, all gave accounts consistent with each  other; the route and the various adventures of the child were plainly  detailed, from its birth till its arrival at the village of Descoutoux.    Justice, thus tracing crime to its sources, had no option but to issue a  warrant for the arrest of the Marchioness de Bouilie; but it seems  probable that it was not served owing to the strenuous efforts of the  Count de Saint-Geran, who could not bring himself to ruin his sister,  seeing that her dishonour would have been reflected on him. The  marchioness hid her remorse in solitude, and appeared again no more. She  died shortly after, carrying the weight of her secret till she drew her  last breath.    The judge of Moulins at length pronounced sentence on the midwife, whom  he declared arraigned and convicted of having suppressed the child born  to the countess; for which he condemned her to be tortured and then  hanged. The matron lodged an appeal against this sentence, and the case  was referred to the Conciergerie.    No sooner had the count and countess seen the successive proofs of the  procedure, than tenderness and natural feelings accomplished the rest.  They no longer doubted that their page was their son; they stripped him  at once of his livery and gave him his rank and prerogatives, under the  title of the Count de la Palice.    Meanwhile, a private person named Sequeville informed the countess that  he had made a very important discovery; that a child had been baptized  in 1642 at St. Jean-en-Greve, and that a woman named Marie Pigoreau had  taken a leading part in the affair. Thereupon inquiries were made, and  it was discovered that this child had been nursed in the village of  Torcy. The count obtained a warrant which enabled him to get evidence  before the judge of Torcy; nothing was left undone to elicit the whole  truth; he also obtained a warrant through which he obtained more  information, and published a monitory. The elder of the Quinet girls on  this told the Marquis de Canillac that the count was searching at a  distance for things very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2755"],[0,"Murat (#9)"],[1,"ts, he saw his whole life  pass before him, from the inn where he had started to the palace he had  reached; no doubt his adventurous career unrolled itself before him like  some golden dream, some brilliant fiction, some tale from the Arabian  Nights.    His life gleamed athwart the storm like a rainbow, and like a rainbow's,  its two extremities were lost in clouds--the clouds of birth and death.  At last he roused himself from this inward contemplation, and lifted a  pale but tranquil face. Then he went to the glass and arranged his hair.  His strange characteristics never left him. The affianced of Death, he  was adorning himself to meet his bride.    Four o'clock struck.    Murat went to the door himself and opened it.    General Nunziante was waiting for him.    \"Thank you, general,\" said Murat. \"You have kept your word. Kiss me, and  go at once, if you like.\"    The general threw himself into the king's arms, weeping, and utterly  unable to speak.    \"Courage,\" said Murat. \"You see I am calm.\" It was this very calmness  which broke the general's heart. He dashed out of the corridor, and left  the castle, running like a madman.    Then the king walked out into the courtyard.    Everything was ready for the execution.    Nine men and a corporal were ranged before the door of the council  chamber. Opposite them was a wall twelve feet high. Three feet away from  the wall was a stone block: Murat mounted it, thus raising himself about  a foot above the soldiers who were to execute him. Then he took out his  watch,[Madame Murat recovered this watch at the price of 200 Louis]  kissed his wife's portrait, and fixing his eyes on it, gave the order to  fire. At the word of command five out of the nine men fired: Murat  remained standing. The soldiers had been ashamed to fire on their king,  and had aimed over his head. That moment perhaps displayed most  gloriously the lionlike courage which was Murat's special attribute. His  face never changed, he did not move a muscle; only gazing at the  soldiers with an expression of mingled bitterness and gratitude, he  said:    \"Thank you; my friends. Since sooner or later you will be obliged to aim  true, do not prolong my death-agonies. All I ask you is to aim at the  heart and spare the face. Now----\"    With the same voice, the same calm, the same expression, he repeated the  fatal words one after another, without lagging, without hastening, as if  he were giving an accustomed command; but this time, happier than the  first, at the word \"Fire!\" he fell pierced by eight bullets, without a  sigh, without a movement, still holding the watch in his left hand.    The soldiers took up the body and laid it on the bed where ten minutes  before he had been sitting, and the captain put a guard at the door.    In the evening a man presented himself, asking to go into the  death-chamber: the sentinel refused to let him in, and he demanded an  interview with the governor of the prison. Led before him, he produced  an order. The commander read it with surprise and disgust, but after  reading it he led the man to the door where he had been refused  entrance.    \"Pass the Signor Luidgi,\" he said to the sentinel.    Ten minutes had hardly elapsed before he came out again, holding a  bloodstained handkerchief containing something to which the sentinel  could not give a name.    An hour later, the carpenter brought the coffin which was to contain the  king's remains. The workman entered the room, but instantly called the  sentinel in a voice of indescribable terror.    The sentinel half opened the door to see what had caused the man's  panic.    The carpenter pointed to a headless corpse!    At the death of King Ferdinand, that, head, preserved in spirits of  wine, was found in a secret cupboard in his bedroom.    A week after the execution of Pizzo everyone had received his reward:  Trenta Capelli was made a colonel, General Nunziante a marquis, and  Luidgi died from the effects of poison.                                            ----"]]]
