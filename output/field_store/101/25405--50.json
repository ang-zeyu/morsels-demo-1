The following  determinations were made by Mr. Wm. M. Hall for mixtures of blue  limestone and Ohio River washed gravel:    Per cent.         Per cent.   Per cent.   Stone.            Gravel.

Using the same sizes of gravel  and Hudson River trap rock, the results were:    Per cent.     Per cent.           Per cent.   Trap.         Gravel.

Pure quartz weighs 165 lbs., per cu. ft., hence broken quartz having 40  per cent. voids weighs 165 × .60 = 99 lbs. per cu. ft. Few gravels are  entirely quartz, and many contain stone having a greater specific  gravity like some traps or a less specific gravity like some shales and  sandstone. Tables VI and VII give the specific gravities of common  stones and minerals and Table VIII gives the weights corresponding to  different percentages of voids for different specific gravities.

Table IX shows the results of tests made by the Illinois Highway  Commission to determine the settlement of crushed stone in wagon loads  for different lengths of haul. The road over which the tests were made  was a macadam road, not particularly smooth, but might be considered as  an average road surface. The wagon used was one with a dump bottom  supported by chains, which were drawn as tight as possible, so as to  reduce the sag to a minimum. It will be noticed that about 50 per cent.  of the settlement occurs within the first 100 ft., and 75 per cent. of  the settlement in the first 200 ft. Almost all of the settlement occurs  during the first half mile, as the tests showed practically no  additional settlement for distances beyond. Some of the wagons were  loaded from the ground with shovels, others were loaded from bins, the  stone having a 15-ft. drop, which compacted the stone a little more than  where loaded with shovels, so that there was somewhat less settlement.  But at the end of a half mile the density was practically the same,  whatever the method of loading. The density at the beginning and at the  end of the haul can be compared by the weight of a given volume of  crushed stone. For convenience, the weight of a cubic yard of the  material at the beginning of the haul and at the end was computed from  the known contents of a wagon.

It  seemed as if he was the only being in the whole world.    Further out he leaned.    Then he started suddenly.    All that great sea of human creatures that had surrounded him when he  went to sleep had vanished!    Not a sheep was to be seen.    Thoroughly alarmed, he turned.    \"Sandy!\" he called. \"Sandy!\"    There was no reply.    With growing apprehension he thrust out his hand in the direction where  the herder had been lying.    The chill of the cold earth met his touch.    Terrified he sprang to his feet and bent down in the darkness.    There was no one with him in the tent! Sandy and the herd were gone!    For a while Donald stood very still. He was really alone, then--alone,  miles from the home ranch, and not knowing the way back again! This was  his first thought. The next was of Sandy.    All that Thornton had hinted flashed into his mind. Sandy was not to be  trusted, Thornton had told his father. If they placed any dependence on  the young Scotchman they would some time regret it.    Had Sandy deceived him?    What possible object could he have, Donald asked himself, in so quietly  departing with the sheep and leaving him behind?    At least he had left the tent.    Had he taken the food and rifles with him?    With beating heart Donald scrambled for his match-box and made a light.    No, there was the knapsack of provisions, the saucepan, the coffee-pot!  In the corner, too, stood his own rifle. But Sandy's rifle was missing.    Donald reflected a moment.    Sandy must be coming back. Ah, that was it! But where had he gone? Why  should he rise up in the middle of the night, take the flock and dogs,  and steal off in this noiseless fashion? The boy could not solve the  enigma.    For the present, at least, there was nothing to be done. He glanced at  his watch. It was three o'clock. He turned into his sleeping-bag again,  having first taken the precaution to put his rifle within easy reach.  Yet try as he would he could not sleep. His eyes stared, broad awake, at  the shadowy dome of the tent. He wished it was day.    As he lay there straining his ears for the cadence of approaching  herd-bells he was conscious of a muffled sound--a dull, soft footfall,  as if some one was loitering stealthily about the tent. He heard it  again. Then he could distinctly hear a sniffing at the corner of the  tent near which the provisions lay.    Donald's heart leaped to his throat.    He could feel the blood pounding under his ears.    Who was coming so near with that velvety tread?    Noiselessly he wriggled out of his sleeping-bag and stood behind the  flap of the tent, rifle in hand. Then he heard the unmistakable panting  of some heavy creature--some creature so close to him that he could  detect the rhythm of every breath it drew. Shaking in every limb he  stole a look outside. Just beside the opening of his shelter he could  see, clearly defined in the moonlight, a thick, dark shadow outlined on  the grass. It was cast by some beast that was halting near the doorway.    In another second it would be upon him.    The boy caught his breath.    There was no time to think.    Raising his rifle, he fired at the great dark mass. Again he fired!    Had he struck the mark?    Another instant would tell.    The creature would either roll over wounded, or would spring upon him.    He jammed back the trigger of his rifle. The tremor that had swept over  him at first now left his hand. His arm was perfectly steady, his blood  swinging in quick throbs through his body. He fired a third time.    There was a heavy thud, the rolling of a black mass on the ground, a  gasp, a growl! Then all was quiet.    Still Donald dared not take any chances. He poured another round of shot  into his victim. It did not move.    Then cautiously he crept outside, his rifle tight in his grasp.    There on the ground a shaggy object lay motionless.    He went nearer.    Then he gave a shout of astonishment.    It was a bear!    He had shot a bear--he, Donald Clark, alone and unaided, had really shot  a bear! What a story to tell his father; and Sandy, too; and the fellows  at home!    Then, for the first time, he was conscious of a trembling in his arms.  His knees felt strangely weak. Now that the excitement was over he  realized that he wanted to sit down. His rifle slipped from his fingers  and he dropped to the turf. There he rested in a dazed sort of way and  reviewed the tragedy. Suppose he had not been awake? Suppose the bear  had come into the tent while he lay there asleep and unarmed? In his  heart he felt very grateful for his escape.    Then there followed a disquieting thought--suppose there were other  bears! He had often read of their coming in groups of fives and sixes.  It was no time for him to sit limply on the ground. He caught up his  rifle and recharged its empty chambers. Then before the tent door he sat  until sunrise, anxiously scanning the dim pasture-land and the distant  rocky fastnesses. It seemed as if the day would never come.    Presently across the intervale he caught the faint tinkle of herd-bells.  Over the brim of rolling green just ahead of him came the flock, Sandy  leading them, and the collies nipping at their heels. The herder strode  rapidly forward, waving his sombrero as he came. Donald ran to meet  him.    \"Are you safe and sound, laddie?\" called Sandy when he got within  shouting distance. \"I have had a thousand minds about you--whether I  ought not to have waked you, tired as you were, and taken you with me;  or whether it was better to let you sleep. You see when the full moon  rose the sheep set out grazing. It's a trick they have. Many a time they  have done it; when they once set out no power on earth will stop them.  So the dogs and I had to go along too. I reckoned you would sleep until  we got back. The herd went farther, though, than I thought they would. I  had great trouble rounding them up.\"    As he talked they neared the camp where Sandy's keen eye took in at a  glance every detail of the scene before him. Then he looked sharply at  Donald. Under the thick tan the boy could see him pale. His lips became  livid.    \"Donald, lad, you are not hurt?\" he cried, motioning to the bear that  lay stretched on the grass.    \"No, Sandy, not a bit. Truly I'm not. See! Isn't he a big one?\"    \"He is many a size too big for a boy like you to be fighting alone. I  was a blind idiot to leave you behind me. Thank the good Lord you got  off without a scratch. When I think of what might have come to you----!  The next time I'll no go grazing without you, Don. But who would have  thought of a bear venturing into these lowlands! He must have been very  hungry.\"    Later Donald had to relate every part of his adventure, and they skinned  the black bear and spread his hide out in the sun.    \"His coat is thicker than that of most bears at this season of the year.  It will make a bonny rug for your father's office, Don. When the  camp-tender comes we will send it back by him to the home ranch.  Thornton can get it cured for you at Glen City and it will be a sightly  present for your father. You are a son worth having!\"    \"I want to be, Sandy.\"    \"Dinna bother your head. I've seen full a dozen lads worse than you!\"  was the grim reply.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER VII    A NARROW ESCAPE      It was not long before Donald felt almost as at home in the hill country  as did Sandy himself. They pitched camp and stayed in one place until  the grazing began to get scarce; then they \"pulled up\" and tramped on.  Sandy knew the region well and was therefore seldom at a loss to find  water-holes. During the night they watched the flock, and as soon as the  herd had fed in the morning and was ready to come to rest they left the  dogs on guard and slept. Donald usually slept soundly, for the fresh air  and exercise kept him in perfect health. Sandy, on the other hand,  slept with one eye open--or one ear open--the boy could never quite  decide which it was. But the result was the same; by some mysterious  means Sandy was always conscious of every move of his flock.    Donald never tired of watching the young Scotchman. What a picture he  was in his flannel blouse, open at the throat; his baggy trousers and  sheepskin belt; his sombrero with its band of Mexican leather; and the  field-glasses slung over his shoulder! From these glasses, his rifle,  and his crook he was seldom parted. His great knuckles, broad from the  grasp of his staff, were like iron; and his lithe, wiry body was never  weary. And yet with all his strength Sandy was the gentlest of men with  his sheep.    To his dogs he was a god! Still, with all their devotion, the collies  evidently understood that the sheep were their first care and they never  deserted their watch to accompany Sandy when he went on a hunt for  water-holes or more abundant feeding grounds. They were wonderfully  intelligent animals--these collies. Donald constantly marveled at their  cleverness. They were quick in singling out the slow or wayward sheep  and would bite their heels to hurry them along. They also recognized the  leaders and it was to them that they communicated the directions Sandy  gave them. Yet Sandy seldom spoke to his dogs. A motion of his arm and  they would spring forward and follow out his wish. Only when he  commanded it did they bark. With their drooping, bushy tails and sharp  noses they reminded Donald far more of wolves than dogs. Sandy was kind  to all of them, but it was Robin and Prince Charlie of which he was most  fond. They had been bred from dogs his father had brought from the Old  Country, he explained to Donald. There were few persons in the world for  whom he cared so much. Once when Robin had been lost on the range the  herder had traveled the hills three whole days to find him.    \"What makes shepherd dogs so different from other dogs, Sandy?\" asked  Donald one day.    \"Some of it is in their blood.
