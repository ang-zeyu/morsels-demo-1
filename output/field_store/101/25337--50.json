To teach his son better \"manners\" in the presence of his  \"superiors,\" Thomas Lincoln struck Abe a heavy blow which knocked him  backward off the fence, and silenced him for a time.    Of course, every one present laughed at Abe's discomfiture, and the  neighbors approved of Thomas Lincoln's rude act as a matter of  discipline. In their opinion Abe Lincoln was getting altogether too  smart. While they enjoyed his homely wit and good nature, they did not  like to admit that he was in any way their superior. A visitor to  Springfield, Ill., will even now find some of Lincoln's old neighbors  eager to say \"there were a dozen smarter men in this city than Lincoln\"  when he \"happened to get nominated for the presidency!\"      SPORTS AND PASTIMES    Abe was \"hail fellow, well met\" everywhere. The women comprehended his  true greatness before the men did so. There was a rough gallantry about  him, which, though lacking in \"polish,\" was true, \"heart-of-oak\"  politeness. He wished every one well. His whole life passed with \"malice  toward none, with charity for all.\"    When he \"went out evenings\" Abe Lincoln took the greatest pains to make  everybody comfortable and happy. He was sure to bring in the biggest  backlog and make the brightest fire. He read \"the funniest fortunes\" for  the young people from the sparks as they flew up the chimney. He was the  best helper in paring the apples, shelling the corn and cracking the  nuts for the evening's refreshments.    When he went to spelling school, after the first few times, he was not  allowed to take part in the spelling match because everybody knew that  the side that \"chose first\" would get Abe Lincoln and he always \"spelled  down.\" But he went just the same and had a good time himself if he could  add to the enjoyment of the rest.    He went swimming, warm evenings, with the boys, and ran races, jumped  and wrestled at noon-times, which was supposed to be given up to eating  and resting. He was \"the life\" of the husking-bee and barn raising, and  was always present, often as a judge because of his humor, fairness and  tact, at horse races. He engaged heartily in every kind of \"manly sport\"  which did not entail unnecessary suffering upon helpless animals.    Coon hunting, however, was an exception. The coon was a pest and a  plague to the farmer, so it should be got rid of. He once told the  following story:      THE LITTLE YELLOW \"COON DOG\"    \"My father had a little yellow house dog which invariably gave the alarm  if we boys undertook to slip away unobserved after night had set in--as  we sometimes did--to go coon hunting. One night my brother, John  Johnston, and I, with the usual complement of boys required for a  successful coon hunt, took the insignificant little cur with us.    \"We located the coveted coon, killed him, and then in a sporting vein,  sewed the coon skin on the little dog.    \"It struggled vigorously during the operation of sewing on, and when  released made a bee-line for home. Some larger dogs on the way, scenting  coon, tracked the little animal home and apparently mistaking him for a  real coon, speedily demolished him. The next morning, father found,  lying in his yard, the lifeless remains of yellow 'Joe,' with strong  circumstantial evidence, in the form of fragments of coon skin, against  us.    \"Father was much incensed at his death, but as John and I, scantily  protected from the morning wind, stood shivering in the doorway, we felt  assured that little yellow Joe would never again be able to sound the  alarm of another coon hunt.\"      THE \"CHIN FLY\" AS AN INCENTIVE TO WORK    While he was President, Mr. Lincoln told Henry J. Raymond, the founder  of the New York _Times_, the following story of an experience he had  about this time, while working with his stepbrother in a cornfield:    \"Raymond,\" said he, \"you were brought up on a farm, were you not? Then  you know what a 'chin fly' is. My brother and I were plowing corn once,  I driving the horse and he holding the plow. The horse was lazy, but on  one occasion he rushed across the field so that I, with my long legs,  could scarcely keep pace with him. On reaching the end of the furrow I  found an enormous chin fly fastened upon the horse and I knocked it off.  My brother asked me what I did that for. I told him I didn't want the  old horse bitten in that way.    \"'Why,' said my brother,'that's all that made him go.'\"    \"Now if Mr. Chase (the Secretary of the Treasury) has a presidential  'chin fly' biting him, I'm not going to knock it off, if it will only  make his department go.\"      \"OLD BLUE NOSE'S\" HIRED MAN    It seemed to be the \"irony of fate\" that Abe should have to work for  \"Old Blue Nose\" as a farm hand. But the lad liked Mrs. Crawford, and  Lincoln's sister Nancy lived there, at the same time, as  maid-of-all-work. Another attraction, the Crawford family was rich, in  Abe's eyes, in possessing several books, which he was glad of the chance  to read.    Mrs. Crawford told many things about young Lincoln that might otherwise  have been lost. She said \"Abe was very polite, in his awkward way,  taking off his hat to me and bowing. He was a sensitive lad, never  coming where he was not wanted. He was tender and kind--like his sister.    \"He liked to hang around and gossip and joke with the women. After he  had wasted too much time this way, he would exclaim:    \"'Well, this won't buy the child a coat,' and the long-legged hired boy  would stride away and catch up with the others.\"    One day when he was asked to kill a hog, Abe answered promptly that he  had never done that, \"but if you'll risk the hog, I'll risk myself!\"    Mrs. Crawford told also about \"going to meeting\" in those primitive  days:    \"At that time we thought it nothing to go eight or ten miles. The ladies  did not stop for the want of a shawl or riding dress, or horses. In the  winter time they would put on their husbands' old overcoats, wrap up  their little ones, and take two or three of them on their beasts, while  their husbands would walk.    \"In winter time they would hold church in some of the neighbors' houses.  At such times they were always treated with the utmost kindness; a  basket of apples, or turnips--apples were scarce in those days--was set  out. Sometimes potatoes were used for a 'treat.' In old Mr. Linkhorn's  (Lincoln's) house a plate of potatoes, washed and pared nicely, was  handed around.\"      FEATS OF STRENGTH    Meanwhile the boy was growing to tall manhood, both in body and in mind.  The neighbors, who failed to mark his mental growth, were greatly  impressed with his physical strength. The Richardson family, with whom  Abe seemed to have lived as hired man, used to tell marvelous tales of  his prowess, some of which may have grown somewhat in the telling. Mr.  Richardson declared that the young man could carry as heavy a load as  \"three ordinary men.\" He saw Abe pick up and walk away with \"a chicken  house, made up of poles pinned together, and covered, that weighed at  least six hundred if not much more.\"    When the Richardsons were building their corn-crib, Abe saw three or  four men getting ready to carry several huge posts or timbers on  \"sticks\" between them. Watching his chance, he coolly stepped in,  shouldered all the timbers at once and walked off alone with them,  carrying them to the place desired. He performed these feats off-hand,  smiling down in undisguised pleasure as the men around him expressed  their amazement. It seemed to appeal to his sense of humor as well as  his desire to help others out of their difficulties.    Another neighbor, \"old Mr. Wood,\" said of Abe: \"He could strike, with a  maul, a heavier blow than any other man. He could sink an ax deeper  into wood than any man I ever saw.\"    Dennis Hanks used to tell that if you heard Abe working in the woods  alone, felling trees, you would think three men, at least, were at work  there--the trees came crashing down so fast.    On one occasion after he had been threshing wheat for Mr. Turnham, the  farmer-constable whose \"Revised Statutes of Indiana\" Abe had devoured,  Lincoln was walking back, late at night from Gentryville, where he and a  number of cronies had spent the evening. As the youths were picking  their way along the frozen road, they saw a dark object on the ground by  the roadside. They found it to be an old sot they knew too well lying  there, dead drunk. Lincoln stopped, and the rest, knowing the tenderness  of his heart, exclaimed:    \"Aw, let him alone, Abe. 'Twon't do him no good. He's made his bed, let  him lay in it!\"    The rest laughed--for the \"bed\" was freezing mud. But Abe could see no  humor in the situation. The man might be run over, or freeze to death.  To abandon any human being in such a plight seemed too monstrous to him.  The other young men hurried on in the cold, shrugging their shoulders  and shaking their heads--\"Poor Abe!--he's a hopeless case,\" and left  Lincoln to do the work of a Good Samaritan alone. He had no beast on  which to carry the dead weight of the drunken man, whom he vainly tried,  again and again, to arouse to a sense of the predicament he was in. At  last the young man took up the apparently lifeless body of the  mud-covered man in his strong arms, and carried him a quarter of a mile  to a deserted cabin, where he made up a fire and warmed and nursed the  old drunkard the rest of that night. Then Abe gave him \"a good talking  to,\" and the unfortunate man is said to have been so deeply impressed by  the young man's kindness that he heeded the temperance lecture and never  again risked his life as he had done that night. When the old man told  John Hanks of Abe's Herculean effort to save him, he added:    \"It was mighty clever in Abe Lincoln to tote me to a warm fire that cold  night.\"      IN JONES' STORE    While Abe was working for the farmers round about his father's farm he  spent many "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#9)"],[1,"under a  shoulder of the summit, where there was dry spruce and green spruce for  camping, the dry for fire and the green for couch, and there we halted  for the night.    [Sidenote: JOHN MUIR]    Next morning we crossed the low pass and dropped down easily into the  wide valley of the Koyukuk South Fork, with a fine prospect of mountains  everywhere as far as the eye could see. I had stood and gazed upon those  same mountains on my journey of the previous winter, my first winter in  Alaska, and had seen a most remarkable sight. As we began the descent  and a turn of the trail gave a new panorama of peaks I did not at first  realise the nature of the peculiar phenomenon I was gazing at. Each peak  had a fine, filmy, fan-shaped cloud stretching straight out from it into  the sky, waving and shimmering as it stretched. The sun was not above  the horizon, but his rays caught these sheer, lawn-like streamers and  played upon them with a most delicate opalescent radiance. Then all at  once came to my mind the recollection of a description in John Muir's  _Mountains of California_ (surely the finest mountain book ever written)  of the snow banners of the Sierra Nevada, and I knew that I was looking  at a similar spectacle. It meant that a storm was raging on high,  although so far we were sheltered from it. It meant that the dry,  sand-like snow of the mountain flanks was driven up those flanks so  fiercely before the wind that it was carried clean over them and beyond  them out into the sky, and still had such pressure behind it that it  continued its course and spread out horizontally, thinning and spreading  for maybe a mile before it lost all coherence and visibility. As far as  I could see mountain peaks I could see the snow banners, all pointing  one way, all waving, all luminous and shimmering in the sun-rays. It was  a very noble sight, and I gazed a long while entranced, not knowing how  ominous it was. When we reached the valley and left the shelter of the  gulch we struck the full force of that fearful gale, and for two days  and nights of incessant blizzard we lay in a hole dug out of a sand-bank  (for we had no tent that year), the trail lost, the grub box nearly  empty, and no fire possible to cook anything with had the grub box been  full.    The valley before us--to resume the narrative--is a high, wind-swept  region of niggerhead and swamp, the catch-basin of the South Fork of the  Koyukuk River. The trail descends one of its southern draws, follows up  the main valley awhile, crosses it, and leaves by one of its northern  draws to pass over the mountains that separate its drainage from the  main fork of the Koyukuk. The cold had given place to wind, and though  the gale did not approach the fierceness of last year's storm, it gave  great trouble in following the track. These high headwater basins are  always windy; the timber is scrubby spruce with many open places, and in  such open places the trail is soon obliterated altogether.    When the light fails this casting about for blazes whenever a clump of  spruce is reached becomes increasingly slow and difficult and at last  becomes hopeless. The general direction determined, it might be thought  that the traveller could ignore the tracks of previous passage and  strike out for himself, but he knows that the trail, however rough, is  at least practicable, whereas an independent course may soon lead to  steep gullies or cut banks, or may entangle him in some thicket that he  must resort to the axe to pass through. Moreover, even two or three  passages through the snow in the winter will give some bottom to a  trail; a bottom that, when the wind-swept areas are passed and the  snow-shoes are resumed, both he and his dogs will be thankful for.    [Sidenote: CAMP MAKING]    So we made a camp as it darkened to night, not far from the spot where I  had \"siwashed\" with an Indian companion the previous winter, the wind  blowing half a gale at 20 deg. below zero.    Making camp under such circumstances is always a very disagreeable  proceeding. It takes time and care to make a comfortable camp, and time  and care in the wind and the cold involve suffering. Two suitable trees  must be selected between which the tent is to be suspended by the  ridge-rope, and the snow must all be scraped away by the snow-shoes, or,  if it be too deep, beaten down. Then while one man unlashes and unpacks  the sleds, another cuts green spruce and lays it all over the tent  space, thicker and finer where the bed is to be. Then up goes the tent,  its corner ropes and its side strings made fast to boughs, if there be  such, or to stakes, or to logs laid parallel to the sides. Then the  stovepipe is jointed and the stove set up on the edge of green billets  properly shaped. Meanwhile the axe-man, the green boughs cut, has been  felling and splitting a dry tree for stove wood, and the whole  proceedings are rushed and hastened towards getting a fire in that  stove. Sometimes it is a question whether we shall get a fire before we  freeze our fingers or freeze our fingers before we get a fire. The fire  once going, we are safe, for however much more work there is in the  open, and there is always a good deal more, one can go to the tent to  get warm. Enough stove wood must be cut, not only for night and morning,  but for cooking the dog feed. The dog pot, filled with snow, into which  the fish are cut up, is put upon the outdoor fire as soon as man-supper  begins cooking in the tent. When it boils, the rice and tallow must be  added, and when the rice has boiled twenty minutes the whole is set  aside to cool. Meanwhile the two aluminum pots full of snow, replenished  from time to time as it melts, are put upon the stove in the tent as the  necessary preliminary to cooking. Sometimes ice, and more rarely water,  may be had, and then supper is hastened. If we are camped on the river  bank sometimes a steel-pointed rifle-bullet fired straight down into the  ice will penetrate to the water below and allow a little jet to bubble  up. Melting snow is a tedious business at best; but, since three times  out of four when camping it must be done, the aluminum pots are a  treasure. There is still work for every one as well as the cook. Snow  must be banked all round the tent to keep out the wind. Little heaps of  spruce boughs must be cut for the dogs' beds; it is all we can do for  them whatever the weather, and they appreciate it highly. It may be that  dog moccasins must be taken off and strung around the stove to dry, and  before supper is ready the inside ridge-rope of the tent is heavy with  all sorts of drying man-wear: socks, moccasins, scarfs, toques,  mittens. One of the earliest habits a man learns on the trail is to hang  up everything to dry as soon as he takes it off. Why should it be hung  up to dry unless it has got wet? the writer was once asked, in detailing  these operations. Because there is no other way to remove the ice with  which everything becomes incrusted in very cold weather.    [Sidenote: CAMP COOKING]    As his snow melts the cook throws into the pot a few handfuls of  evaporated potatoes, a handful of evaporated onions, and smaller  quantities of evaporated \"soup vegetables,\" and leaves them to soak and  simmer and resume their original size and flavour. By and by he will cut  up the moose meat or the rabbits or birds, or whatever game he may have,  and throw it in, and in an hour or an hour and a half there will be a  savoury stew that, with a pan of biscuits cooked in an aluminum  reflector beside the stove and a big pot of tea, constitutes the  principal meal of the day. Or if the day has been long and sleep seems  more attractive even than grub, he will turn some frozen beans, already  boiled, into a frying-pan with a big lump of butter, and when his meat  is done supper is ready. Beans thus prepared eaten red hot with grated  cheese are delicious to a hungry man. With the stove for a sideboard,  food may always be eaten hot, and that is one advantage of camp fare.    The men satisfied, the dogs remain, and while two of the party wash  dishes and clean up, the third feeds the dogs. Their pot of food has  been cooling for an hour or more. They will not eat it until it is cold  and a mess of rice will hold heat a long time even in the coldest  weather. When it is nearly cold it is dished out with a paddle into the  individual pans and the dogs make short work of it. There are some who  feed straight fish, and, if the fish be king salmon of the best quality,  the dogs do well enough on it. But on any long run it is decidedly  economical to cook for the dogs--not so much from the standpoint of  direct cost as from that of weight and ease of hauling. An hundred  pounds of fish plus an hundred pounds of rice plus fifty pounds of  tallow will go a great deal farther than two hundred and fifty pounds of  fish alone. There is little doubt, too, that in the long run the dogs do  better on cooked food. It is easier of digestion and easier to apportion  in uniform rations. Rice and fish make excellent food. The Japs took  Port Arthur on rice and fish. The tallow answers a demand of the climate  and is increased as the weather grows colder. Man and dog alike require  quantities of fat food in this climate; it is astonishing how much bacon  and butter one can eat. When the dogs have eaten, and each one has made  the rounds of all the other pans to be sure nothing is left, they retire  to their respective nests of spruce bough and curl themselves up with  many turnings round and much rearranging of the litter. Feet and nose  are neatly tucked in, the tail is adjusted carefully over all, the hair  on the body stands straight up, and the dogs have gone to bed and do not  like to be disturbed again.    [Sidenote: DOG-HARNESS]    Therein lies the cruelty of depriving them of their tails, which used  to be the general custom in this country. The old tandem harness almost"]]]
