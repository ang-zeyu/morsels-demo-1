CHAPTER VIII    SOME FAIRY-TALES OF LONG AGO (_Continued_)      Our next story belongs to a time several hundred years later, and I dare  say it seemed as wonderful to the little Egyptians as the story of  Sindbad the Sailor does to you. It is called \"The Story of the  Shipwrecked Sailor,\" and the sailor himself tells it to a noble  Egyptian.    \"I was going,\" he says, \"to the mines of Pharaoh, and we set sail in a  ship of 150 cubits long and 40 cubits wide (225 feet by 60 feet--quite a  big ship for the time). We had a crew of 150 of the best sailors of  Egypt, men whose hearts were as bold as lions. They all foretold a happy  voyage, but as we came near the shore a great storm blew, the sea rose  in terrible waves, and our ship was fairly overwhelmed. Clinging to a  piece of wood, I was washed about for three days, and at last tossed up  on an island; but not one was left of all my shipmates--all perished in  the waves.    \"I lay down in the shade of some bushes, and when I had recovered a  little, I looked about me for food. There was plenty on every hand--figs  and grapes, berries and corn, with all manner of birds. When my hunger  was satisfied, I lit a fire, and made an offering to the gods who had  saved me. Suddenly I heard a noise like thunder; the trees shook, and  the earth quaked. Looking round, I saw a great serpent approaching me.  He was nearly 50 feet long, and had a beard 3 feet in length. His body  shone in the sun like gold, and when he reared himself up from his coils  before me I fell upon my face.    \"Then the serpent began to speak: 'What has brought thee, little one,  what has brought thee? If thou dost not tell me quickly what has brought  thee to this isle, I shall make thee vanish like a flame.' So saying, he  took me up in his mouth, carried me gently to his lair, and laid me down  unhurt; and again he said, 'What has brought thee, little one, what has  brought thee to this isle of the sea?' So I told him the story of our  shipwreck, and how I alone had escaped from the fury of the waves. Then  said he to me: 'Fear not, little one, and let not thy face be sad. If  thou hast come to me, it is God who has brought thee to this isle, which  is filled with all good things. And now, see: thou shalt dwell for four  months in this isle, and then a ship of thine own land shall come, and  thou shalt go home to thy country, and die in thine own town. As for me,  I am here with my brethren and my children. There are seventy-five of us  in all, besides a young girl, who came here by chance, and was burned by  fire from heaven. But if thou art strong and patient, thou shalt yet  embrace thy children and thy wife, and return to thy home.'    \"Then I bowed low before him, and promised to tell of him to Pharaoh,  and to bring him ships full of all the treasures of Egypt; but he smiled  at my speech, and said, 'Thou hast nothing that I need, for I am Prince  of the Land of Punt, and all its perfumes are mine. Moreover, when thou  departest, thou shalt never again see this isle, for it shall be changed  into waves.'    [Illustration: PLATE 9.  AN EGYPTIAN COUNTRY HOUSE.]    \"Now, behold! when the time was come, as he had foretold, the ship drew  near. And the good serpent said to me, 'Farewell, farewell! go to thy  home, little one, see again thy children, and let thy name be good in  thy town; these are my wishes for thee.' So I bowed low before him, and  he loaded me with precious gifts of perfume, cassia, sweet woods, ivory,  baboons, and all kinds of precious things, and I embarked in the ship.  And now, after a voyage of two months, we are coming to the house of  Pharaoh, and I shall go in before Pharaoh, and offer the gifts which I  have brought from this isle into Egypt, and Pharaoh shall thank me  before the great ones of the land.\"    Our last story belongs to a later age than that of the Shipwrecked  Sailor. About 1,500 years before Christ there arose in Egypt a race of  mighty soldier-Kings, who founded a great empire, which stretched from  the Soudan right through Syria and Mesopotamia as far as the great River  Euphrates. Mesopotamia, or Naharaina, as the Egyptians called it, had  been an unknown land to them before this time; but now it became to them  what America was to the men of Queen Elizabeth's time, or the heart of  Africa to your grandfathers--the wonderful land of romance, where all  kinds of strange things might happen. And this story of the Doomed  Prince, which I have to tell you, belongs partly to Naharaina, and, as  you will see, some of our own fairy-stories have been made out of very  much the same materials as are used in it.    Once upon a time there was a King in Egypt who had no child. His heart  was grieved because he had no child, and he prayed to the gods for a  son; so in course of time a son was born to him, and the Fates (like  fairy godmothers) came to his cradle to foretell what should happen to  him. And when they saw him, they said, \"His doom is to die either by the  crocodile, or by the serpent, or by the dog.\" When the King heard this,  his heart was sore for his little son, and he resolved that he would put  the boy where no harm could come to him; so he built for him a beautiful  house away in the desert, and furnished it with all kinds of fine  things, and sent the boy there, with faithful servants to guard him, and  to see that he came to no hurt. So the boy grew up quietly and safely in  his house in the desert.    But it fell on a day that the young Prince looked out from the roof of  his house, and he saw a man walking across the desert, with a dog  following him. So he said to the servant who was with him, \"What is this  that walks behind the man who is coming along the road?\" \"It is a dog,\"  said the page. Then the boy said, \"You must bring me one like him,\" and  the page went and told His Majesty. Then the King said, \"Get a little  puppy, and take it to him, lest his heart be sad.\" So they brought him a  little dog, and it grew up along with him.    Now, it happened that, when the boy had grown to be a strong young man,  he grew weary of being always shut up in his fine house. Therefore he  sent a message to his father, saying, \"Why am I always to be shut up  here? Since I am doomed to three evil Fates, let me have my desire, and  let God do what is in His heart.\" So the King agreed, and they gave the  young Prince arms, and sent him away to the eastern frontier, and his  dog went with him, and they said to him, \"Go wherever you will.\" So he  went northward through the desert, he and his dog, until he came to  the land of Naharaina.    [Illustration: Plate 10  STATUES OF KING AMENHOTEP III.]    Now, the chief of the land of Naharaina had no children, save one  beautiful daughter, and for her he had built a wonderful house. It had  seventy windows, and it stood on a great rock more than 100 feet high.  And the chief summoned the sons of all the chiefs of the country round  about, and said to them, \"The Prince who can climb to my daughter's  window shall have her for his wife.\" So all the young Princes of the  land camped around the house, and tried every day to climb to the window  of the beautiful Princess; but none of them succeeded, for the rock was  very steep and high.    Then, one day when they were climbing as they were wont, the young  Prince of Egypt rode by with his dog; and the Princes welcomed him,  bathed him, and fed his horse, and said to him, \"Whence comest thou,  thou goodly youth?\" He did not wish to tell them that he was the son of  Pharaoh, so he answered, \"I am the son of an Egyptian officer. My father  married a second wife, and, when she had children, she hated me, and  drove me away from my home.\" So they took him into their company, and he  stayed with them many days.    Now, it fell on a day that he asked them, \"Why do you stay here, trying  always to climb this rock?\" And they told him of the beautiful Princess  who lived in the house on the top of the rock, and how the man who could  climb to her window should marry her. Therefore the young Prince of  Egypt climbed along with them, and it came to pass that at last he  climbed to the window of the Princess; and when she saw him, she fell in  love with him, and kissed him.    Then was word sent to the Chief of Naharaina that one of the young men  had climbed to his daughter's window, and he asked which of the Princes  it was, and the messenger said, \"It is not a Prince, but the son of an  Egyptian officer, who has been driven away from Egypt by his  stepmother.\" Then the Chief of Naharaina was very angry, and said,  \"Shall I give my daughter to an Egyptian fugitive? Let him go back to  Egypt.\" But, when the messengers came to tell the young man to go away,  the Princess seized his hand, and said, \"If you take him from me, I will  not eat; I will not drink; I shall die in that same hour.\" Then the  chief sent men to kill the youth where he was in the house. But the  Princess said, \"If you kill him, I shall be dead before the sun goes  down. I will not live an hour if I am parted from him.\" So the chief was  obliged to agree to the marriage; and the young Prince was married to  the Princess, and her father gave them a house, and slaves, and fields,  and all sorts of good things.    But after a time the young Prince said to his wife, \"I am doomed to die,  either by a crocodile, or by a serpent, or by a dog.\" And his wife  answered, \"Why, then, do you keep this dog always with you? Let him be  killed.\" \"Nay,\" said he, \"I am not going to kill my faithful dog, which  I have brought up since the time that he was a puppy.\" So the Princess  feared greatly for her husband, and would never let him go out of her  sight.    Now, it happened in course of time that the Prince went back to the land  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22816"],[0,"The Adventures of Buster Bear (#9)"],[1,"had thought of berries,\" growled Buster to himself.          XXII    BUSTER BEAR HAS A FIT OF TEMPER        A temper is a bad, bad thing      When once it gets away.    There's nothing quite at all like it      To spoil a pleasant day.    Buster Bear was in a terrible temper. Yes, Sir, Buster Bear was having  the worst fit of temper ever seen in the Green Forest. And the worst  part of it all was that all his neighbors of the Green Forest and a  whole lot from the Green Meadows and the Smiling Pool were also there to  see it. It is bad enough to give way to temper when you are all alone,  and there is no one to watch you, but when you let temper get the best  of you right where others see you, oh, dear, dear, it certainly is a  sorry sight.    Now ordinarily Buster is one of the most good-natured persons in the  world. It takes a great deal to rouse his temper. He isn't one tenth so  quick tempered as Chatterer the Red Squirrel, or Sammy Jay, or Reddy  Fox. But when his temper is aroused and gets away from him, then watch  out! It seemed to Buster that he had had all that he could stand that  day and a little more. First had come the fright back there in the Old  Pasture. Then the pail had slipped down behind his ears and held fast,  so he had run all the way to the Green Forest with it hanging about his  neck. This was bad enough, for he knew just how funny he must look, and  besides, it was very uncomfortable. But to have Sammy Jay call everybody  within hearing to come and see him was more than he could stand. It  seemed to Buster as if everybody who lives in the Green Forest, on the  Green Meadows, or around the Smiling Brook, was sitting around his  hiding place, laughing and making fun of him. It was more than any  self-respecting Bear could stand.    With a roar of anger Buster Bear charged out of his hiding place. He  rushed this way and that way! He roared with all his might! He was very  terrible to see. Those who could fly, flew. Those who could climb,  climbed. And those who were swift of foot, ran. A few who could neither  fly nor climb nor run fast, hid and lay shaking and trembling for fear  that Buster would find them. In less time than it takes to tell about  it, Buster was alone. At least, he couldn't see any one.    [Illustration: Those who could fly, flew. Those who could climb,  climbed. _Page 112._]    Then he vented his temper on the tin pail. He cuffed at it and pulled at  it, all the time growling angrily. He lay down and clawed at it with his  hind feet. At last the handle broke, and he was free! He shook himself.  Then he jumped on the helpless pail. With a blow of a big paw he sent it  clattering against a tree. He tried to bite it. Then he once more fell  to knocking it this way and that way, until it was pounded flat, and no  one would ever have guessed that it had once been a pail.    Then, and not till then, did Buster recover his usual good nature.  Little by little, as he thought it all over, a look of shame crept into  his face. \"I--I guess it wasn't the fault of that thing. I ought to have  known enough to keep my head out of it,\" he said slowly and  thoughtfully.    \"You got no more than you deserve for stealing Farmer Brown's boy's  berries,\" said Sammy Jay, who had come back and was looking on from the  top of a tree. \"You ought to know by this time that no good comes of  stealing.\"    Buster Bear looked up and grinned, and there was a twinkle in his eyes.  \"You ought to know, Sammy Jay,\" said he. \"I hope you'll always remember  it.\"    \"Thief, thief, thief!\" screamed Sammy, and flew away.          XXIII    FARMER BROWN'S BOY LUNCHES ON BERRIES        When things go wrong in spite of you    To smile's the best thing you can do--    To smile and say, \"I'm mighty glad    They are no worse; they're not so bad!\"    That is what Farmer Brown's boy said when he found that Buster Bear had  stolen the berries he had worked so hard to pick and then had run off  with the pail. You see, Farmer Brown's boy is learning to be something  of a philosopher, one of those people who accept bad things cheerfully  and right away see how they are better than they might have been. When  he had first heard some one in the bushes where he had hidden his pail  of berries, he had been very sure that it was one of the cows or young  cattle who live in the Old Pasture during the summer. He had been afraid  that they might stupidly kick over the pail and spill the berries, and  he had hurried to drive whoever it was away. It hadn't entered his head  that it could be anybody who would eat those berries.    When he had yelled and Buster Bear had suddenly appeared, struggling to  get off the pail which had caught over his head, Farmer Brown's boy had  been too frightened to even move. Then he had seen Buster tear away  through the brush even more frightened than he was, and right away his  courage had begun to come back.    \"If he is so afraid of me, I guess I needn't be afraid of him,\" said  he. \"I've lost my berries, but it is worth it to find out that he is  afraid of me. There are plenty more on the bushes, and all I've got to  do is to pick them. It might be worse.\"    He walked over to the place where the pail had been, and then he  remembered that when Buster ran away he had carried the pail with him,  hanging about his neck. He whistled. It was a comical little whistle of  chagrin as he realized that he had nothing in which to put more berries,  even if he picked them. \"It's worse than I thought,\" cried he. \"That  bear has cheated me out of that berry pie my mother promised me.\" Then  he began to laugh, as he thought of how funny Buster Bear had looked  with the pail about his neck, and then because, you know he is learning  to be a philosopher, he once more repeated, \"It might have been worse.  Yes, indeed, it might have been worse. That bear might have tried to eat  me instead of the berries. I guess I'll go eat that lunch I left back by  the spring, and then I'll go home. I can pick berries some other day.\"    Chuckling happily over Buster Bear's great fright, Farmer Brown's boy  tramped back to the spring where he had left two thick sandwiches on a  flat stone when he started to save his pail of berries. \"My, but those  sandwiches will taste good,\" thought he. \"I'm glad they are big and  thick. I never was hungrier in my life. Hello!\" This he exclaimed right  out loud, for he had just come in sight of the flat stone where the  sandwiches should have been, and they were not there. No, Sir, there  wasn't so much as a crumb left of those two thick sandwiches. You see,  Old Man Coyote had found them and gobbled them up while Farmer Brown's  boy was away.    But Farmer Brown's boy didn't know anything about Old Man Coyote. He  rubbed his eyes and stared everywhere, even up in the trees, as if he  thought those sandwiches might be hanging up there. They had disappeared  as completely as if they never had been, and Old Man Coyote had taken  care to leave no trace of his visit. Farmer Brown's boy gaped foolishly  this way and that way. Then, instead of growing angry, a slow smile  stole over his freckled face. \"I guess some one else was hungry too,\" he  muttered. \"Wonder who it was? Guess this Old Pasture is no place for me  to-day. I'll fill up on berries and then I'll go home.\"    So Farmer Brown's boy made his lunch on blueberries and then rather  sheepishly he started for home to tell of all the strange things that  had happened to him in the Old Pasture. Two or three times, as he  trudged along, he stopped to scratch his head thoughtfully. \"I guess,\"  said he at last, \"that I'm not so smart as I thought I was, and I've got  a lot to learn yet.\"    This is the end of the adventures of Buster Bear in this book  because--guess why. Because Old Mr. Toad insists that I must write a  book about his adventures, and Old Mr. Toad is such a good friend of all  of us that I am going to do it.
