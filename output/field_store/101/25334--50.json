An archway leads us from the infirmary into what is called the Dark Entry,  whence a passage leads to the Prior's Gate and onward into the Prior's  Court, more commonly known as the Green Court: this passage was the  eastern boundary of the infirmary cloister. Over it Prior de Estria  raised the _scaccarium_, or checker-building, the counting-house of  the monastery.    Turning back towards the infirmary entrance we come to #the Lavatory  Tower#, which stands out from the west end of the substructure of the  Prior's Chapel. The chapel itself was pulled down at the close of the  seventeenth century, and a brick-built library was erected on its site.  The lavatory tower is now more commonly called the baptistery, but this  name gives a false impression, and only came into use because the building  now contains a font, given to the cathedral by Bishop Warner. The lower  part of the tower is late Norman in style, and was built in the latter half  of the twelfth century, when the monastery was supplied with a system of  works by which water was drawn from some distant springs, which still  supply the cathedral and precincts. The water was distributed from this  tower to the various buildings. The original designs of the engineer are  preserved at Trinity College, Cambridge. The upper part of the tower was  rebuilt by Prior Chillenden.    From the lavatory tower a covered passage leads into the great cloister,  which can also be approached from a door in the north-west transept. The  cloister, though it stands upon the space covered by that built by  Lanfranc, is largely the work of the indefatigable Prior Chillenden. It  shows traces of many architectural periods. The east walk contains a door,  leading into the transept, embellished with a triple arcade of early  English; under the central arch of the arcade is the doorway itself, a  later addition in Perpendicular. There is also a Norman doorway which once  communicated with the monks' dormitory: after the Reformation it was  walled up, but in 1813 the plaster which concealed it was taken away, and  since then it has been carefully restored. The rest of the work in this  part of the cloister is chiefly Perpendicular. The north walk is adorned  with an Early English arcade, against which the shafts which support  Chillenden's vaulting work are placed with rather unsatisfactory effect.  Towards the western end of this walk is the door of the refectory.    [Illustration: TURRET OF SOUTH-WEST TRANSEPT.]    The cellarer's quarters were outside the west walk, and they were  connected with the cloister by a doorway at the north-west corner:  opposite this entrance was a door leading to the archbishop's palace, and  through this Becket made his way towards the cathedral when his murderers  were in pursuit of him.    The great dormitory of the monks was built along the east walk of the  cloister, extending some way beyond it. It was pulled down in 1547, but  the substructure was left standing, and some private houses were erected  upon it. These were removed in the middle of the last century, and a good  deal of the substructure remained until 1867, when the vaulting which  survived was pulled down to make way for the new library, which was  erected on the dormitory site. Some of the pillars on which the vault of  the substructure rested are preserved in a garden in the precincts; and a  fragment of the upper part of the dormitory building, which escaped the  demolition in 1547, may be seen in the gable of the new library. The  substructure was a fine building, 148 feet by 78 feet; the vaulting was,  as described by Professor Willis, \"of the earliest kind; constructed of  light tufa, having no transverse ribs, and retaining the impressions of  the rough, boarded centring upon which they had been formed.\" A second  minor dormitory ran eastward from the larger one, while outside this was  the third dormitory, fronting the Green Court. Some portion of the vaults  of this building is still preserved in the garden before the lavatory  tower.    #The Chapter House# lies eastward of the wall of the cloister, on the site  of the original Norman building, which was rather less extensive. The  present structure is oblong in shape, measuring 90 feet by 35 feet. The  roof consists of a \"barrel vault\" and was built by Prior Chillenden, along  with the whole of the upper storey at the end of the fourteenth century.  The windows, high and four-lighted, are also his work; those at the east  and west ends exceed in size all those of the cathedral, having seven  lights. The lower storey was built by Prior de Estria about a century  before the work was completed by Chillenden. De Estria also erected the  choir-screen in the cathedral, which will be described in its proper  place. The walls of the chapter house are embellished with an arcade of  trefoiled arches, surmounted by a cornice. At the east end stands a throne  with a splendid canopy. This building was at one time, after the  Reformation, used as a sermon house, but the inconvenience caused by  moving the congregation from the choir, where service was held, across to  the chapter house to hear the discourse, was so great that the practice  was not long continued. It has been restored, and its opening by H.R.H.  the Prince of Wales, May 29th, 1897, is announced just as this edition  goes to press.    [Illustration: THE CLOISTERS.]    #The Library# covers a portion of the site of the monks' dormitory. Stored  within it is a fine collection of books, some of which are exceedingly  rare. The most valuable specimens--among which are some highly interesting  bibles and prayer-books--are jealously guarded in a separate apartment  called the study. The most interesting document in the collection of  charters and other papers connected with the foundation is the charter of  Edred, probably written by Dunstan _propriis digitorum articulis_; this  room also contains an ancient picture of Queen Edgiva painted on wood,  with an inscription below enlarging on the beauties of her character and  her munificence towards the monastery.    In the garden before the lavatory tower, to the west of the prior's  gateway, two columns are preserved which once were part of the ancient  church at Reculver--formerly Regulbium, whither Ethelbert retired after  making over his palace in Canterbury to Augustine. These columns were  brought to Canterbury after the destruction, nearly a hundred years ago,  of the church to which they belonged. After lying neglected for some time  they were placed in their present position by Mr. Sheppard, who bestowed  so much care on all the \"antiquities\" connected with the cathedral. These  columns are believed by experts to be undoubted relics of Roman work: they  are of circular form with Ionic capitals. A curious ropework decoration on  the bases is said to be characteristically Roman, occurs on a monument  outside the Porta Maggiore at Rome.    #The Deanery# is a very much revised version of what once was the \"New  Lodging,\" a building set up for the entertainment of strangers by Prior  Goldstone at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Nicholas Wotton, the  first Dean, chose this mansion for his abode, but since his day the  building has been very materially altered.    [Illustration: NORMAN STAIRCASE IN THE CLOSE  (FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY CARL NORMAN AND CO.).]    [Illustration: DETAILS OF THE NORMAN STAIRCASE IN THE CLOSE.]    The main gate of the #Green Court# is noticeable as a choice specimen of  Norman work; on its northern side formerly stood the Aula Nova which was  built in the twelfth century; the modern buildings which house the King's  School have supplanted the hall itself, but the splendid staircase, a  perfect example of Norman style and quite unrivalled in England, is  luckily preserved, and ranks among the chief glories of Canterbury.    The site of the archbishop's palace is commemorated by the name of the  street--Palace Street--in which a ruined archway, all that remains of the  building, may still be seen. This mansion, in which so many royal and  imperial guests had been entertained with \"solemne dauncing\" and other  good cheer, was pillaged and destroyed by the Puritans; since then the  archbishops have had no official house in their cathedral city.    [Illustration: DETAILS OF ORNAMENT.]          CHAPTER III.    INTERIOR.      Dean Stanley tells us that in the days of our Saxon forefathers and for  some time after, \"all disputes throughout the whole kingdom that could not  be legally referred to the king's court or to the hundreds of counties\"  were heard and judged on in the south porch of Canterbury Cathedral. This  was always the principal entrance, and was known in early days as the  \"Suthdure\" by which name it is often mentioned in \"the law books of the  ancient kings.\" Through this door we enter the nave of the cathedral; this  part of the building was erected towards the end of the fourteenth  century; Lanfranc's nave seems to have fallen into an unsafe and ruinous  state, so much so that in December, 1378, Sudbury, who was then  archbishop, \"issued a mandate addressed to all ecclesiastical persons in  his diocese enjoining them to solicit subscriptions for rebuilding the  nave of the church, '_propter ipsius notoriam et evidentem ruinam_' and  granting forty days' indulgence to all contributors.\" Archbishop Courtenay  gave a thousand marks and more for the building fund, and Archbishop  Arundell gave a similar contribution, as well as the five bells which were  known as the \"Arundell ryng.\" We are told also that \"King Henry the 4th  helped to build up a good part of the Body of the Chirch.\" The immediate  direction of the work was in the hands of Prior Chillenden, already  frequently mentioned; his epitaph, quoted by Professor Willis, states that  \"Here lieth Thomas Chyllindene formerly Prior of this Church, _Decretorum  Doctor egregius_, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#9)"],[1,"before, and as every pigeon-lover hospitably expects the messengers to  do. The owner of the loft was there and noted the strange Bird. He  stepped quietly to where he could inspect him. One of his own Pigeons  made momentary opposition to the stranger, and Arnaux, sparring  sidewise with an open wing in Pigeon style, displayed the long array of  printed records. The man was a fancier. His interest was aroused; he  pulled the string that shut the flying door, and in a few minutes  Arnaux was his prisoner.    The robber spread the much-inscribed wings, read record after record,  and glancing at the silver badge--it should have been gold--he read his  name--Arnaux; then exclaimed: \"Arnaux! Arnaux! Oh, I've heard of you,  you little beauty, and it's glad I am to trap you.\" He snipped the  message from his tail, unrolled it, and read: \"Arnaux left Chicago this  morning at 4 A.M., scratched in the Any Age Sweepstakes for New York.\"    \"Six hundred miles in twelve hours! By the powers, that's a  record-breaker.\" And the pigeon-stealer gently, almost reverently, put  the fluttering Bird safely into a padded cage. \"Well,\" he added, \"I  know it's no use trying to make you stay, but I can breed from you and  have some of your strain.\"    So Arnaux was shut up in a large and comfortable loft with several  other prisoners. The man, though a thief, was a lover of Homers; he  gave his captive everything that could insure his comfort and safety.  For three months he left him in that loft. At first Arnaux did nothing  all day but walk up and down the wire screen, looking high and low for  means of escape; but in the fourth month he seemed to have abandoned  the attempt, and the watchful jailer began the second part of his  scheme. He introduced a coy young lady Pigeon. But it did not seem to  answer; Arnaux was not even civil to her. After a time the jailer  removed the female, and Arnaux was left in solitary confinement for a  month. Now a different female was brought in, but with no better luck;  and thus it went on--for a year different charmers were introduced.  Arnaux either violently repelled them or was scornfully indifferent,  and at times the old longing to get away, came back with twofold power,  so that he darted up and down the wire front or dashed with all his  force against it.    When the storied feathers of his wings began their annual moult, his  jailer saved them as precious things, and as each new feather came he  reproduced on it the record of its owner's fame.    Two years went slowly by, and the jailer had put Arnaux in a new loft  and brought in another lady Pigeon. By chance she closely resembled the  faithless one at home. Arnaux actually heeded the newcomer. Once the  jailer thought he saw his famous prisoner paying some slight attention  to the charmer, and, yes, he surely saw her preparing a nest. Then  assuming that they had reached a full understanding, the jailer, for  the first time, opened the outlet, and Arnaux was free. Did he hang  around in doubt? Did he hesitate? No, not for one moment. As soon as  the drop of the door left open the way, he shot through, he spread  those wonderful blazoned wings, and, with no second thought for the  latest Circe, sprang from the hated prison loft--away and away.      V    We have no means of looking into the Pigeon's mind; we may go wrong in  conjuring up for it deep thoughts of love and welcome home; but we are  safe in this, we cannot too strongly paint, we cannot too highly praise  and glorify that wonderful God-implanted, mankind-fostered home-love  that glows unquenchably in this noble bird. Call it what you like, a  mere instinct deliberately constructed by man for his selfish ends,  explain it away if you will, dissect it, misname it, and it still is  there, in overwhelming, imperishable master-power, as long as the brave  little heart and wings can beat.    Home, home, sweet home! Never had mankind a stronger love of home than  Arnaux. The trials and sorrows of the old pigeon-loft were forgotten in  that all-dominating force of his nature. Not years of prison bars, not  later loves, nor fear of death, could down its power; and Arnaux, had  the gift of song been his, must surely have sung as sings a hero in his  highest joy, when sprang he from the 'lighting board, up-circling free,  soaring, drawn by the only impulse that those glorious wings would  honor,--up, up, in widening, heightening circles of ashy blue in the  blue, flashing those many-lettered wings of white, till they seemed  like jets of fire--up and on, driven by that home-love, faithful to his  only home and to his faithless mate; closing his eyes, they say;  closing his ears, they tell; shutting his mind,--we all believe,--to  nearer things, to two years of his life, to one half of his prime, but  soaring in the blue, retiring, as a saint might do, into his inner  self, giving himself up to that inmost guide. He was the captain of the  ship, but the pilot, the chart and compass, all, were that  deep-implanted instinct. One thousand feet above the trees the  inscrutable whisper came, and Arnaux in arrowy swiftness now was  pointing for the south-southeast. The little flashes of white fire on  each side were lost in the low sky, and the reverent robber of Syracuse  saw Arnaux nevermore.    The fast express was steaming down the valley. It was far ahead, but  Arnaux overtook and passed it, as the flying wild Duck passes the  swimming Muskrat. High in the valleys he went, low over the hills of  Chenango, where the pines were combing the breezes.    Out from his oak-tree eyrie a Hawk came wheeling and sailing, silent,  for he had marked the Flyer, and meant him for his prey. Arnaux turned  neither right nor left, nor raised nor lowered his flight, nor lost a  wing-beat. The Hawk was in waiting in the gap ahead, and Arnaux passed  him, even as a Deer in his prime may pass by a Bear in his pathway.  Home! home! was the only burning thought, the blinding impulse.    Beat, beat, beat, those flashing pinions went with speed unslacked on  the now familiar road. In an hour the Catskills were at hand. In two  hours he was passing over them. Old friendly places, swiftly coming  now, lent more force to his wings. Home! home! was the silent song that  his heart was singing. Like the traveller dying of thirst, that sees  the palm-trees far ahead, his brilliant eyes took in the distant smoke  of Manhattan.    Out from the crest of the Catskills there launched a Falcon. Swiftest  of the race of rapine, proud of his strength, proud of his wings, he  rejoiced in a worthy prey. Many and many a Pigeon had been borne to his  nest, and riding the wind he came, swooping, reserving his strength,  awaiting the proper time. Oh, how well he knew the very moment! Down,  down like a flashing javelin; no wild Duck, no Hawk could elude him,  for this was a Falcon. Turn back now, O Homer, and save yourself; go  round the dangerous hills. Did he turn? Not a whit! for this was  Arnaux. Home! home! home! was his only thought. To meet the danger, he  merely added to his speed; and the Peregrine stooped; stooped at  what?--a flashing of color, a twinkling of whiteness--and went back  empty. While Arnaux cleft the air of the valley as a stone from a  sling, to be lost--a white-winged bird--a spot with flashing halo--and,  quickly, a speck in the offing. On down the dear valley of Hudson, the  well-known highway; for two years he had not seen it! Now he dropped  low as the noon breeze came north and ruffled the river below him.  Home! home! home! and the towers of a city are coming in view! Home!  home! past the great spider-bridge of Poughkeepsie, skimming, skirting  the river-banks. Low now by the bank as the wind arose. Low, alas! too  low!    What fiend was it tempted a gunner in June to lurk on that hill by the  margin? what devil directed his gaze to the twinkling of white that  came from the blue to the northward? Oh, Arnaux, Arnaux, skimming low,  forget not the gunner of old! Too low, too low you are clearing that  hill. Too low--too late!  Flash--bang! and the death-hail has reached  him; reached, maimed, but not downed him. Out of the flashing pinions  broken feathers printed with records went fluttering earthward. The  \"naught\" of his sea record was gone. Not two hundred and ten, but  twenty-one miles it now read. Oh, shameful pillage! A dark stain  appeared on his bosom, but Arnaux kept on. Home, home, homeward bound.  The danger was past in an instant. Home, homeward he steered straight  as before, but the wonderful speed was diminished; not a mile a minute  now; and the wind made undue sounds in his tattered pinions. The stain  in his breast told of broken force; but on, straight on, he flew. Home,  home was in sight, and the pain in his breast was forgotten. The tall  towers of the city were in clear view of his far-seeing eye as he  skimmed by the high cliffs of Jersey. On, on--the pinion might flag,  the eye might darken, but the home-love was stronger and stronger.    Under the tall Palisades, to be screened from the wind, he passed, over  the sparkling water, over the trees, under the Peregrines' eyrie, under  the pirates' castle where the great grim Peregrines sat; peering like  black-masked highwaymen they marked the on-coming Pigeon. Arnaux knew  them of old. Many a message was lying undelivered in that nest, many a  record-bearing plume had fluttered away from its fastness. But Arnaux  had faced them before, and now he came as before--on, onward, swift,  but not as he had been; the deadly gun had sapped his force, had  lowered his speed. On, on; and the Peregrines, biding their time, went  forth like two bow-bolts; strong and lightning-swift they went against  one weak and wearied.    Why tell of the race that followed? Why paint the despair of a brave  little heart in sight of the home he had craved in vain? in a minute  all was over. The Peregrines screeched in their triumph. Screeching and"]]]
