I consider it a divine requisition that my whole       course of conduct, both in political and social life, should be       governed by the infallible precepts of revelation; hypocrisy is       inexcusable, even in the most trifling circumstances.         _Sept. 29th._--I find difficulties to overcome in my literary       pursuits, I had never anticipated; and it is only by the most       indefatigable labour I can succeed. I am much oppressed by the       labours of this day. I need Divine aid in this as well as in       spiritual pursuits.         _Sept. 30th._--I have been enabled to study with considerable       facility. Prayer I find the most profitable employment, practice       the best instructor, and thanksgiving the sweetest recreation. May       this be my experience every day!         _October, 2nd._--I am another week nearer my eternal destiny! Am I       nearer heaven, and better prepared for death than at its       commencement? Do I view sin with greater abhorence? Are my views of       the Deity more enlarged? Is it my meat and drink to do his holy       will? Oh, my God, how much otherwise!         _From the 3rd to the 9th Oct._--During this period the afflicting       hand of God has been upon me; thank God, when distressed with       bodily pain, I have felt a firm assurance of Divine favour, so that       all fear of death has been taken away. My soul is too unholy to       meet a holy God, and mingle with the society of the blest. Oh, God,       save me from the deceitfulness of my own heart!         _Oct. 10th, Sabbath._--I am rapidly recovering health and strength.       The Lord is my refuge and comfort. Surrounded by temptations, the       applause of men is often too fascinating, and my treacherous heart       dresses things in false colours. But, bless God, in his goodness       and mercy he recalls my wandering steps, and invites me to dwell in       safety under the shadow of his wing.         _Oct. 11th._--No graces are of more importance than patience and       perseverance. They give consistency and dignity to character. We       may possess the most sparkling talents and the most interesting       qualities, but without these graces, the former lose their lustre,       and the latter their charms. In religion their influence is more       important, as they form the character, by enabling us to surmount       difficulties and remove obstacles. I am far from thinking them       constitutional virtues, with a little additional cultivation, but I       consider them the gift of heaven, less common than is generally       imagined, though sometimes faintly counterfeited. They differ from       natural or moral excellence in this being the proper and consistent       exercise of those virtues.         _Oct. 12th._--It is two weeks to-day since I first wrote home. A       week ago I received a kind letter from my brother George, but was       too ill with fever to read it, or to write in reply until to-day. I       said: \"I feel truly thankful to you for the tender concern and warm       interest which you express in your letter. Tell my dear Mother that       I share with her her afflictions, and that I am daily more forcibly       convinced that every earthly comfort and advantage is transient and       unsatisfactory, that this is not our home, but that our highest       happiness amidst these fluctuating scenes, is to insure the favour       and protection of him who alone can raise us above afflictions and       calamities.\"         _November 20th._--More than a month has elapsed since I recorded my       religious feelings and enjoyments on paper. During this period, I       have sometimes realized all the pleasures of health; at other       times, borne down with pain and sickness, the spirit would be cast       down. At such seasons of depression, religion would come in as my       only comfort, and with the Psalmist I would exclaim, \"Hope thou in       God, for I shall yet praise him who is the light of my countenance,       and my God.\" Thus I find from blessed experience, that in every       state and condition, union and intercourse with God brings true       peace, joy, trust, and praise. If there be any honour, here it is.       If there be any wealth, this is it. \"I would rather be a       door-keeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of       wickedness.\" O Lord, give me more of the mind of Christ!         _Nov. 25th._--In entering on the field of life, I find my mind much       perplexed with the variety of objects presented to my view. The       comforts and tranquility of domestic happiness attract my       attention, and excite warm desires in my heart. Am I not to taste       the pleasures which two hearts reciprocally united in one, mutually       communicate? or must I give up the home of domestic enjoyment to       the calls of duty, and the salvation of men? Has heaven designed       that I should spend my days in seeking the lost sheep of the House       of Israel? May divine wisdom direct me, and suffer me not to follow       the dictates of my own will!         _Nov. 26th._--By taking a retrospective view of what is past, we       learn to ask more wisely in the time to come. The cool dictates of       reason, assisted by that inward monitor, conscience, placed within       the breast of every individual, strongly condemns every deviation       from propriety, justice, or morality. By mingling with society we       learn human nature, and the scenes of public resort afford us a       field for useful observation, yet retirement is the place to       acquire the most important knowledge--_the knowledge of ourselves_.       What would it avail us to dive into the mysteries of science, or       entertain the world with new discoveries, to acquaint ourselves       with the principles of morality, or learn the whole catalogue of       Christian doctrines, if we are unacquainted with our own hearts,       and strangers to the business of self-government?         _February 12th, 1825._--During the long period since I last penned       my religious meditations, my feelings, hopes, and prospects have       been extremely varied. While I was promising myself health and many       temporal pleasures, God saw fit to show me the uncertainty of       earthly things, and the necessity and wisdom of submission to his       will, by the rod of affliction. During my sickness I have derived       much pleasure and profit from the visits of pious friends, so that       I have felt it is good to be afflicted.[4]         _Feb. 13th._--I am resolved, by God's assisting grace, to keep the       following resolutions:--(1) Endeavour to fix my first waking       thoughts on God; (2) By rising early to attend to my devotions, and       reading the Scriptures; (3)By praying oftener each day, and       maintaining a more devotional frame of mind; (4) By being more       circumspect in my conduct and conversation; (5) By improving my       time more diligently in reading useful books, and study; (6) By       watching over my thoughts, and keeping my desires within proper       bounds; (7) By examining myself more closely by the scripture rule;       (8) By leaving myself and all that concerns me to God's disposal;       (9) By reviewing every evening the actions of the day, and       especially every Sabbath, examining wherein I have come short, or       have kept God's precepts.         _Feb. 16th._--I have lately been closely employed in reading Bishop       Burnet's History of the Reformation. How sad to reflect on the       cruelties that were then practised against the professors of true       religion! What a reason for thankfulness that the sway of papal       authority can no longer inflict papal obligations on the       consciences of men! But after careful research into this highly       authentic history, I find but few vestiges of that apostolic purity       which churchmen so boastfully attribute to that memorable period of       Christian history. Great allowance, is, however, to be made when       we consider that they were just emerging out of the superstitions       of popery. That doctrines, discipline, and ceremonies, cannot be       established without the royal assent, even when they are approved       both by ecclesiastical and legislative authority, is a practice so       different from anything that the Primitive Church authorizes, it       seems to me to originate from quite a different source; that a       whole nation should be bound in their religious opinions by a       single individual, savours so much of popery, I think it may       properly be called its offspring. Pretentions to regal supremacy in       church affairs were never made till a late period, although this       interference of papal authority in matters entirely spiritual, does       not annul any ecclesiastical power, or prove its doctrines to be       corrupt, or its ordinations illegal. It may be justly ranked among       the invasions of modern corruption.         _Feb. 17th._--Since I drew up, four days since, several resolutions       for amendment, I bless God I have reason to believe I have made       some improvement. I have applied myself more closely to study,       prayed oftener, and governed my thoughts with more rigour.         _Feb. 27th._--I am now emerging into life, surrounded by blessings       and opportunities for usefulness and improvement; but, alas! where       is my gratitude, my love to God, my zeal for his cause, and for the       salvation of those who are ignorant of the great truths of the       Gospel? If, O God, thou hast designed this awfully important work       for me, qualify me for it; increase and enlarge my desires for the       salvation of immortal souls!         _March 15th._--This day I have recommenced my studies with Mr. John       Law, at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#9)"],[1,"from inquiring why all this must be done so secretly  in the night. He answered me that his relations, who considered his  purpose inhuman, would prevent him from accomplishing it by day; but  only let the head once be cut off, and they could say little more  about it: he could, indeed, have brought the head to me, but a natural  feeling prevented him from cutting it off himself.    These words brought us to a large splendid house; my companion pointed  it out to me as the termination of our nocturnal walk. We passed the  principal door, and entering a small gate, which the stranger  carefully closed after him, ascended, in the dark, a narrow, winding  staircase. This brought us to a dimly-lighted corridor, from which we  entered an apartment; a lamp, suspended from the ceiling, shed its  brilliant rays around.    In this chamber stood a bed, on which lay the corpse; the Unknown  turned away his face, as if wishing to conceal his tears. He beckoned  me to the bed, and bidding me set about my business speedily yet  carefully, went out by the door.    I seized my knives, which, as a physician, I constantly carried with  me, and approached the bed. Only the head of the corpse was visible,  but that was so beautiful that the deepest compassion involuntarily  came over me. In long braids the dark hair hung down; the face was  pale, the eyes closed. At first, I made an incision in the skin,  according to the practice of surgeons when they remove a limb. Then I  took my sharpest knife and cut entirely through the throat. But,  horror! the dead opened her eyes--shut them again--and in a deep sigh  seemed now, for the first time, to breathe forth her life! Straightway  a stream of hot blood sprang forth from the wound. I was convinced  that I had killed the poor girl; for that she was dead there could be  no doubt--from such a wound there was no chance of recovering. I stood  some moments in anxious wo, thinking on what had happened. Had the  Red-mantle deceived me, or was his sister, perhaps, only apparently  dead? The latter appeared to me more probable. Yet I dared not tell  the brother of the deceased, that, perhaps, a less rash blow would  have aroused, without having killed her; therefore I began to sever  the head entirely--but once again the dying one groaned, stretched  herself out in a convulsion of pain, and breathed her last. Then  terror overpowered me, and I rushed shivering out of the apartment.    But outside in the corridor it was dark, for the lamp had died out; no  trace of my companion was perceptible, and I was obliged to move along  by the wall, at hazard in the dark, in order to reach the  winding-stairs. I found them at last, and descended, half falling,  half gliding. There was no one below; the door was only latched, and I  breathed more freely when I was in the street, out of the uneasy  atmosphere of the house. Spurred on by fear, I ran to my dwelling, and  buried myself in the pillow of my bed, in order to forget the horrid  crime I had committed. But sleep fled my eyelids, and soon morning  admonished me again to collect myself. It seemed probable to me, that  the man who had led me to this villainous deed, as it now appeared to  me, would not denounce me. I immediately resolved to attend to my  business in my shop, and to put on as careless an air as possible.  But, alas! a new misfortune, which I now for the first time observed,  augmented my sorrow. My cap and girdle, as also my knives, were  missing; and I knew not whether they had been left in the chamber of  the dead, or lost during my flight. Alas! the former seemed more  probable, and they could discover in me the murderer.    I opened my shop at the usual time; a neighbor stepped in, as was his  custom, being a communicative man. \"Ah! what say you to the horrid  deed,\" he cried, \"that was committed last night?\" I started as if I  knew nothing. \"How! know you not that with which the whole city is  filled? Know you not that last night, the fairest flower in Florence,  Bianca, the daughter of the Governor, was murdered? Ah! only yesterday  I saw her walking happily through the streets with her bridegroom, for  to-day she would have had her nuptial festival!\"    Every word of my neighbor was a dagger to my heart; and how often  returned my torments! for each of my customers told me the story, one  more frightfully than another; yet not one could tell it half so  horribly as it had seemed to me. About mid-day, an officer of justice  unexpectedly walked into my shop, and asked me to clear it of the  bystanders.    \"Signor Zaleukos,\" said he, showing me the articles I had lost,  \"belong these things to you?\" I reflected whether I should not  entirely disown them; but when I saw through the half-opened door, my  landlord and several acquaintances, who could readily testify against  me, I determined not to make the matter worse by a falsehood, and  acknowledged the articles exhibited as my own. The officer told me to  follow him, and conducted me to a spacious building, which I soon  recognised as the prison. Then, a little farther on, he showed me into  an apartment.    My situation was terrible, as I reflected on it in my solitude. The  thought of having committed a murder, even against my wish, returned  again and again. Moreover, I could not conceal from myself that the  glance of the gold had dazzled my senses; otherwise I would not have  fallen so blindly into the snare.    Two hours after my arrest, I was led from my chamber, and after  descending several flights of stairs, entered a spacious saloon.  Around a long table hung with black, were seated twelve men, mostly  gray with age. Along the side of the room, benches were arranged, on  which were seated the first people of Florence. In the gallery, which  was built quite high, stood the spectators, closely crowded together.  As soon as I reached the black table, a man with a gloomy, sorrowful  air arose--it was the Governor. He told the audience that, as a  father, he could not judge impartially in this matter, and that he,  for this occasion, would surrender his seat to the oldest of the  senators. The latter was a gray-headed man, of at least ninety years.  He arose, stooping beneath the weight of age; his temples were covered  with thin white hair, but his eyes still burned brightly, and his  voice was strong and steady. He began by asking me whether I confessed  the murder. I entreated his attention, and with dauntless, distinct  voice, related what I had done and all that I knew. I observed that  the Governor during my recital turned first pale, then red, and when I  concluded, became furious. \"How, wretch!\" he cried out to me,  \"wishest thou thus to lay upon another, the crime thy avarice has  committed?\"    The Senator rebuked him for his interruption, after having of his own  free will resigned his right; moreover, that it was not so clear, that  I had done the deed through avarice, for according to his own  testimony, nothing had been taken from the corpse. Yes, he went still  further; he told the Governor that he must give an account of his  daughter's early life, for in this way only could one conclude whether  I had told the truth or not. Immediately he closed the court for that  day, for the purpose, as he said, of consulting the papers of the  deceased, which the Governor was to give him. I was carried back to my  prison, where I passed a sorrowful day, constantly occupied with the  ardent hope, that they would in some way discover the connection  between the deceased and the Red-mantle.    Full of hope, I proceeded the next day to the justice-hall. Several  letters lay upon the table; the old Senator asked whether they were of  my writing. I looked at them, and found that they were by the same  hand as both the letters that I had received. This I disclosed to the  Senator; but he seemed to give but little weight to it, answering that  I must have written both, for the name subscribed was unquestionably a  Z, the initial of my name. The letters, however, contained menaces  against the deceased, and warnings against the marriage which she was  on the point of consummating. The Governor seemed to have imparted  something strange and untrue, with respect to my person; for I was  treated this day with more suspicion and severity. For my  justification, I appealed to the papers, which would be found in my  room, but I was informed that search had been made and nothing found.  Thus, at the close of the court, vanished all my hope; and when, on  the third day, I was led again to the hall, the judgment was read  aloud, that I was convicted of a premeditated murder, and sentenced to  death. To such extremity had I come; forsaken by all that was dear to  me on earth, far from my native land, innocent and in the bloom of my  years, I was to die by the axe!    On the evening of this terrible day which had decided my fate, I was  seated in my lonely dungeon, my hopes past, my thoughts seriously  turned upon death, when the door of my prison opened, and a man  entered who regarded me long in silence.    \"Do I see you again, in this situation, Zaleukos?\" he began. By the  dim light of my lamp I had not recognised him, but the sound of his  voice awoke within me old recollections. It was Valetty, one of the  few friends I had made during my studies at Paris. He said that he had  casually come to Florence, where his father, a distinguished man,  resided; he had heard of my story, and come to see me once more, to  inquire with his own lips, how I could have been guilty of such an  awful crime. I told him the whole history: he seemed lost in wonder,  and conjured me to tell him, my only friend, all the truth, and not to  depart with a lie upon my tongue. I swore to him with the most solemn  oath, that I had spoken the truth; and that no other guilt could be  attached to me, than that, having been blinded by the glance of the  gold, I had not seen the improbability of the Stranger'"]]]
