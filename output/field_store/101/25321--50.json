As for the girls, well--they knew that the bushes      were dripping wet, and that if they set their feet      upon their native heath, they would certainly be      made to change their stockings as soon as they went      home. This was a severe discourager of romance.      There was nothing to prevent any one of them from      asking questions, however. _That_ was a business in      which they excelled.        \"But why did the Highland people want to rebel,      anyway?\" demanded Hugh John. \"If I could have      hunted like that, and raided, and carried off      cattle, and had a castle with pipes playing and      hundreds of clansmen to drill, I shouldn't have      been such a soft as to rebel and get them all taken      away from me!\"        \"It was because they were loyal to their rightful      King,\" said Sweetheart, who is a Cavalier and a      Jacobite--in the intervals of admiring Cromwell,      and crying because they shot down the poor      Covenanters.        \"_I_ think,\" said Sir Toady, who had been sitting      very thoughtful, \"that they just liked to fight,      and King George would not let them. So they wanted      a king who would not mind. Same as us, you know. If      we are caught fighting in school, we get whipped,      but father lets us fight outside as much as we want      to. Besides, what did old Vich Ian Vohr want with      all these silly Highlanders, eating up everything      in his castle, if there were never any battles that      they could fight for him?\"        This was certainly a very strong and practical      view, and so much impressed the others that they      sat a long while quiet, turning it over in their      minds.        \"Well, at any rate,\" said Sweetheart, dropping her      head with a sigh to go on with her seam, \"I know      that Flora Mac-Ivor was truly patriotic. See how      she refused to listen to Waverley, all because she      wanted to give her life for the cause.\"        \"Humph,\" said Hugh John, disrespectfully turning up      his nose, \"that's all girls think about--loving,      an' marrying, an' playing on harps--\"        \"I don't play on harps,\" sighed Sweetheart, \"but I      do wish I had a banjo!\"        \"I wish I had a targe and a broadsword, and the      Chief's horse, Brown Dermid, to ride on,\" said Hugh      John, putting on his \"biggety\" look.        \"And a nice figure you would cut,\" sneered Sir      Toady Lion, provokingly; \"Highlanders don't fight      on horseback! You ought to know that!\"        Whereupon the first engagement of the campaign was      immediately fought out on the carpet. And it was      not till after the intervention of the Superior      Power had restored quiet that the next tale from      _Waverley_ could be proceeded with.        THE FOURTH TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY\"      HERE AND THERE AMONG THE HEATHER    NOT long after Callum Beg had been left behind, and indeed almost as  soon as the innkeeper and Edward were fairly on their way, the former  suddenly announced that his horse had fallen lame and that they must  turn aside to a neighbouring smithy to have the matter attended to.    \"And as it is the Fast Day, and the smith a religious man, it may cost  your Honour as muckle as sixpence a shoe!\" suggested the wily innkeeper,  watching Edward's face as he spoke.    For this announcement Edward cared nothing. He would gladly have paid a  shilling a nail to be allowed to push forward on his journey with all  speed. Accordingly to the smithy of Cairnvreckan they went. The village  was in an uproar. The smith, a fierce-looking man, was busy hammering  \"dogs' heads\" for musket-locks, while among the surrounding crowd the  names of great Highland chiefs--Clanronald, Glengarry, Lochiel, and that  of Vich Ian Vohr himself, were being bandied from mouth to mouth.    Edward soon found himself surrounded by an excited mob, in the midst of  which the smith's wife, a wild witchlike woman, was dancing, every now  and then casting her child up in the air as high as her arms would  reach, singing all the while, and trying to anger the crowd, and  especially to infuriate her husband, by the Jacobite songs which she  chanted.    At last the smith could stand this provocation no longer. He snatched a  red-hot bar of iron from the forge, and rushed at his wife, crying out  that he would \"thrust it down her throat.\" Then, finding himself held  back by the crowd from executing vengeance on the woman, all his anger  turned upon Edward, whom he took to be a Jacobite emissary. For the news  which had caused all this stir was that Prince Charles had landed and  that the whole Highlands was rallying to his banner.    So fierce and determined was the attack which the angry smith of  Cairnvreckan made on Edward that the young man was compelled to draw his  pistol in self-defence. And as the crowd threatened him and the smith  continued furiously to attack with the red-hot iron, almost  unconsciously his finger pressed the trigger. The shot went off, and  immediately the smith fell to the ground. Then Edward, borne down by the  mob, was for some time in great danger of his life. He was saved at last  by the interference of the minister of the parish, a kind and gentle old  man, who caused Edward's captors to treat him more tenderly. So that  instead of executing vengeance upon the spot as they had proposed, they  brought him before the nearest magistrate, who was, indeed, an old  military officer, and, in addition, the Laird of the village of  Cairnvreckan, one Major Melville by name.    [Illustration: \"SO fierce and determined was the attack which the angry  smith of Cairnvreckan made on Edward that the young man was compelled to  draw his pistol in self-defence.\"]    The latter proved to be a stern soldier, so severe in manner that he  often became unintentionally unjust. Major Melville found that though  the blacksmith's wound proved to be a mere scratch, and though he had to  own that the provocation given was a sufficient excuse for Edward's  hasty action, yet he must detain the young man prisoner upon the warrant  issued against Edward Waverley, which had been sent out by the Supreme  Court of Scotland.    Edward, who at once owned to his name, was astonished beyond words to  find that not only was he charged with being in the company of actual  rebels, such as the Baron of Bradwardine and Vich Ian Vohr, but also  with trying to induce his troop of horse to revolt by means of private  letters addressed to one of them, Sergeant Houghton, in their barracks  at Dundee. Captain Waverley was asserted to have effected this through  the medium of a pedlar named Will Ruthven, or Wily Will--whose very name  Edward had never heard up to that moment.    As the magistrate's examination proceeded, Waverley was astonished to  find that, instead of clearing himself, everything he said, every  article he carried about his person, was set down by Major Melville as  an additional proof of his complicity with treason. Among these figured  Flora's verses, his own presence at the great hunting match among the  mountains, his father's and Sir Everard's letters, even the huge  manuscripts written by his tutor (of which he had never read six  pages)--all were brought forward as so many evidences of his guilt.    Finally, the magistrate informed Edward that he would be compelled to  detain him a prisoner in his house of Cairnvreckan. But that if he would  furnish such information as it was doubtless in his power to give  concerning the forces and plans of Vich Ian Vohr and the other Highland  chiefs, he might, after a brief detention, be allowed to go free. Edward  fiercely exclaimed that he would die rather than turn informer against  those who had been his friends and hosts. Whereupon, having refused all  hospitality, he was conducted to a small room, there to be guarded till  there was a chance of sending him under escort to the Castle of  Stirling.    Here he was visited by Mr. Morton, the minister who had saved him from  the clutches of the mob, and so sympathetically and kindly did he speak,  that Edward told him his whole story from the moment when he had first  left Waverley-Honour. And though the minister's favourable report did  not alter the opinion Major Melville had formed of Edward's treason, it  softened his feelings toward the young man so much that he invited him  to dinner, and afterwards did his best to procure him favourable  treatment from the Westland Whig captain, Mr. Gifted Gilfillan, who  commanded the party which was to convoy him to Stirling Castle.    The escort which was to take Edward southward was not so strong as it  might have been. Part of Captain Gifted Gilfillan's command had stayed  behind to hear a favourite preacher upon the occasion of the afternoon  Fast Day service at Cairnvreckan. Others straggled for purposes of their  own, while as they went along, their leader lectured Edward upon the  fewness of those that should be saved. Heaven, he informed Edward, would  be peopled exclusively by the members of his own denomination. Captain  Gifted was still engaged in condemning all and sundry belonging to the  Churches of England and Scotland, when a stray pedlar joined his party  and asked of \"his Honour\" the favour of his protection as far as  Stirling, urging as a reason the uncertainty of the times and the value  of the property he carried in his pack.    The pedlar, by agreeing with all that was said, and desiring further  information upon spiritual matters, soon took the attention of Captain  Gifted Gilfillan from his prisoner. He declared that he had even  visited, near Mauchline, the very farm of the Whig leader. He  congratulated him upon the fine breed of cattle he possessed. Then he  went on to speak of the many evil, popish, and unchristian things he had  seen in his travels as a pedlar over the benighted countries of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#9)"],[1," settler to whom the  original packing-box was sent in 1638.    The old-time board-cloth was in no way inferior in quality or whiteness  to our present table-linen; for we know how proud colonial wives and  daughters were of the linen of their own spinning, weaving, and  bleaching. The linen tablecloth was either of holland, huckaback,  dowlas, osnaburg, or lockram--all heavy and comparatively coarse  materials--or of fine damask, just as to-day; some of the handsome  board-cloths were even trimmed with lace.    The colonists had plenty of napkins; more, as a rule, than families of  corresponding means and station own to-day. They had need of them, for  when America was first settled forks were almost unknown to English  people--being used for eating in luxurious Italy alone, where travellers  having seen and found them useful and cleanly, afterwards introduced  them into England. So hands had to be constantly employed for holding  food, instead of the forks we now use, and napkins were therefore as  constantly necessary. The first fork brought to America was for Governor  John Winthrop, in Boston, in 1633, and it was in a leather case with a  knife and a bodkin. If the governor ate with a fork at the table, he  was doubtless the only person in the colony who did so. Thirty or forty  years later a few two-tined iron and silver forks were brought across  the water, and used in New York and Virginia, as well as Massachusetts;  and by the end of the century they had come into scant use at the tables  of persons of wealth and fashion. The first mention of a fork in  Virginia is in an inventory dated 1677; this was of a single fork. The  salt-cellar, or saler, as it was first called, was the centrepiece of  the table--\"Sett in the myddys of the tabull,\" says an old treatise on  laying the table. It was often large and high, of curious device in  silver, and was then called a standing salt. Guests of honor were seated  \"above the salt,\" that is, near the end of the table where sat the host  and hostess side by side; while children and persons who were not of  much dignity or account as guests were placed \"below the salt,\" that is,  below the middle of the table.    There is owned by Harvard University, and here shown in an  illustration, \"a great silver salt\" given to the college in 1644, when  the new seat of learning was but eight years old. At the table it  divided graduates, the faculty, and such, from the undergraduates. It  was valued at L5 1s. 3d., at five shillings an ounce, which was  equal to a hundred dollars to-day; a rich gift, which shows to me the  profound affection of the settlers for the new college. It is inscribed  with the name of the giver, Mr. Richard Harris. It is of simple English  design well known during that century, and made in various sizes. There  is no doubt that many of similar pattern, though not so heavy or so  rich, were seen on the tables of substantial colonists. They are named  in many wills. Often a small projecting arm was attached to one side,  over which a folded napkin could be thrown to be used as a cover; for  the salt-cellar was usually kept covered, not only to preserve  cleanliness, but in earlier days to prevent the ready introduction of  poison.    There are some very entertaining and curious old English books which  were written in the sixteenth century to teach children and young  rustics correct and elegant manners at the table, and also helpful ways  in which to serve others. These books are called _The Babees Boke_, _The  Boke of Nurture_, _The Boke of Curteseye_, etc., and with the exception  of variations in the way of serving a dinner, and a few obsolete  customs, and in the names and shapes and materials of the different  dishes, plates, etc., used at the table, these books are just as  instructive and sensible to-day as then. From them we learn that the  only kind of table furnishings used at that time were cups to drink out  of; spoons and knives to eat with; chafing-dishes to serve hot food;  chargers for display and for serving large quantities of food;  salt-cellars, and trenchers for use as plates. There were very few other  table appointments used on any English table, either humble or great,  when the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth.    One of the most important articles for setting the table was the  trencher. These were made of wood, and often were only a block of wood,  about ten or twelve inches square and three or four deep, hollowed down  into a sort of bowl in the middle. In this the food was  placed,--porridge, meat, vegetables, etc. Each person did not have even  one of these simple dishes; usually two children, or a man and his wife,  ate out of one trencher. This was a custom in England for many years;  and some very great people, a duke and his wife, not more than a century  and a half ago, sat side by side at the table and ate out of one plate  to show their unity and affection. It is told of an old Connecticut  settler, a deacon, that as he had a wood-turning mill, he thought he  would have a trencher apiece for his children. So he turned a sufficient  number of round trenchers in his mill. For this his neighbors deemed him  deeply extravagant and putting on too many airs, both as to quantity and  quality, since square trenchers, one for use by two persons, were good  enough for any one, even a deacon. So great a warrior and so prominent a  man in the colony as Miles Standish used wooden trenchers at the table,  as also did all the early governors. Nor did they disdain to name them  in their wills, as valued household possessions. For many years college  boys at Harvard ate out of wooden trenchers at the college mess-table.    I have seen a curious old table top, or table-board, which permitted  diners seated at it to dispense with trenchers or plates. It was of  heavy oak about six inches thick, and at intervals of about eighteen  inches around its edge were scooped out deep, bowl-shaped holes about  ten inches in diameter, in which each individual's share of the dinner  was placed. After each meal the top was lifted off the trestles,  thoroughly washed and dried, and was ready for the next meal.    Poplar-wood is an even, white, and shining wood. Until the middle of  this century poplar-wood trenchers and plates were used on the table in  Vermont, and were really attractive dishes. From earliest days the  Indians made and sold many bowls and trenchers of maple-wood knots. One  of these bowls, owned by King Philip, is at the rooms of the  Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston. Old wooden trenchers and  \"Indian bowls\" can be seen at the Memorial Hall in Deerfield. Bottles  were made also of wood, and drinking-cups and \"noggins,\" which were a  sort of mug with a handle. Wood furnished many articles for the table to  the colonist, just as it did in later days on our Western frontiers,  where trenchers of wood and plates of birch-bark were seen in every  log-cabin.    The word tankard was originally applied to a heavy and large vessel of  wood banded with metal, in which to carry water. Smaller wooden drinking  tankards were subsequently made and used throughout Europe, and were  occasionally brought here by the colonists. The plainly shaped wooden  tankard, made of staves and hoops and here shown, is from the collection  at Deerfield Memorial Hall. It was found in the house of Rev. Eli Moody.  These commonplace tankards of staves were not so rare as the beautiful  carved and hooped tankard which is here pictured, and which is in the  collection of Mrs. Samuel Bowne Duryea, of Brooklyn. I have seen a few  other quaintly carved ones, black with age, in American families of  Huguenot descent; these were apparently Swiss carvings.    The chargers, or large round platters found on every dining-table, were  of pewter. Some were so big and heavy that they weighed five or six  pounds apiece. Pewter is a metal never seen for modern table  furnishing, or domestic use in any form to-day; but in colonial times  what was called a garnish of pewter, that is, a full set of pewter  platters, plates, and dishes, was the pride of every good housekeeper,  and also a favorite wedding gift. It was kept as bright and shining as  silver. One of the duties of children was to gather a kind of horse-tail  rush which grew in the marshes, and because it was used to scour pewter,  was called scouring-rush.    Pewter bottles of various sizes were sent to the Massachusetts Bay  Colony, in 1629. Governor Endicott had one, but they were certainly far  from common. Dram cups, wine mugs, and funnels of pewter were also  occasionally seen, but scarcely formed part of ordinary table  furnishings. Metheglin cans and drinking-mugs of pewter were found on  nearly every table. Pewter was used until this century in the wealthiest  homes, both in the North and South, and was preferred by many who owned  rich china. Among the pewter-lovers was the Revolutionary patriot, John  Hancock, who hated the clatter of the porcelain plates.    Porringers of pewter, and occasionally of silver, were much used at the  table, chiefly for children to eat from. These were a pretty little  shallow circular dish with a flat-pierced handle. Some had a \"fish-tail\"  handle; these are said to be Dutch. These porringers were in many  sizes, from tiny little ones two inches in diameter to those eight or  nine inches across. When not in use many housekeepers kept them hanging  on hooks on the edge of a shelf, where they formed a pretty and cheerful  decoration. The poet Swift says:--        \"The porringers that in a row      Hung high and made a glittering show.\"    It should be stated that the word porringer, as used by English  collectors, usually refers to a deep cup with a cover and two handles,  while what we call porringers are known to these collectors as  bleeding-basins or tasters. Here we apply the term taster, or  wine-taster, to a small, shallow silver cup with bosses in the bottom to"]]]
