The South could not. The  Southern women gave in their whole supply of silk for the big balloon  that was lost during the Seven Days' Battle in the second year of  the war. The Southern soldiers never forgave what they considered  the ungallant trick of the Northerners who took this many-hued  balloon from a steamer stranded on a bar at low tide down near  the mouth of the James. Thus fell the last silk dress, a queer  tribute to Northern sea-power! Northern sea-power also cut off  nearly everything the sick and wounded needed; which raised the  death rate of the Southern forces far beyond the corresponding death  rate in the North. Again, preserved rations were almost unknown in  the South. But they were plentiful throughout the Northern armies:  far too plentiful, indeed, for the taste of the men, who got \"fed  up\" on the dessicated vegetables and concentrated milk which they  rechristened \"desecrated vegetables\" and \"consecrated milk.\"    There is the same tale to tell about transport and munitions. Outside  the Tredegar Iron Works at Richmond the only places where Southern  cannon could be made were Charlotte in North Carolina, Atlanta and  Macon in Georgia, and Selma in Alabama. The North had many places,  each with superior plant, besides which the oversea munition world  was far more at the service of the open-ported North than of the  close-blockaded South. What sea-power meant in this respect may be  estimated from the fact that out of the more than three-quarters of  a million rifles bought by the North in the first fourteen months  of the war all but a beggarly thirty thousand came from overseas.    [Illustration: North and South in 1861.]    Transport was done by road, rail, sea, and inland waters. Other  things being equal, a hundred tons could be moved by water as easily  as ten by rail or one by road. Now, the North not only enjoyed  enormous advantages in sea-power, both mercantile and naval, but  in road, rail, canal, and river transport too. The road transport  that affected both sides most was chiefly in the South, because most  maneuvering took place there. \"Have you been through Virginia?--Yes,  in several places\" is a witticism that might be applied to many  another State where muddy sloughs abounded. In horses, mules, and  vehicles the richer North wore out the poorer and blockaded South.  Both sides sent troops, munitions, and supplies by rail whenever  they could; and here, as a glance at the map will show, the North  greatly surpassed the South in mileage, strategic disposition,  and every other way.    The South had only one through line from the Atlantic to the  Mississippi; and this ran across that Northern salient which threatened  the South from the southwestern Alleghanies. The other rails all had  the strategic defect of not being convenient for rapid concentration  by land; for most of the Southern rails were laid with a view to  getting surplus cotton and tobacco overseas. The strategic gap  at Petersburg was due to a very different cause; for there, in  order to keep its local transfers, the town refused to let the most  important Virginian lines connect.    Taking sea-power in its fullest sense, to include all naval and  mercantile parts on both salt and fresh water, we can quite understand  how it helped the nautical North to get the strangle-hold on the  landsman's South. The great bulk of the whole external trade of  the South was done by shipping. But, though the South was strong in  exportable goods, it was very weak in ships. It owned comparatively  few of the vessels that carried its rice, cotton, and tobacco crops  to market and brought back made goods in return. Yankees, Britishers,  and Bluenoses (as Nova Scotian craft were called) did most of the  oversea transportation.    Moreover, the North was vastly stronger than the South on all the  inland waters that were not \"Secesh\" from end to end. The map shows  how Northern sea-power could not only divide the South in two but  almost enisle the eastern part as well. Holding the Mississippi  would effect the division, while holding the Ohio would make the  eastern part a peninsula, with the upper end of the isthmus safe in  Northern hands between Pittsburgh, the great coal and iron inland  port, and Philadelphia, the great seaport, less than three hundred  miles away. The same isthmus narrows to less than two hundred miles  between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg (on the Susquehanna River); and  its whole line is almost equally safe in Northern hands. A little  farther south, along the disputed borderlands, it narrows to less  than one hundred miles, from Pittsburgh to Cumberland (on the Potomac  canal). Even this is not the narrowest part of the isthmus, which  is less than seventy miles across from Cumberland to Brownsville  (on the Monongahela) and less than fifty from Cumberland to the  Ohiopyle Falls (on the Youghiogheny). These last distances are  measured between places that are only fit for minor navigation.  But even small craft had an enormous advantage over road and rail  together when bulky stores were moved. So Northern sea-power could  make its controlling influence felt in one continuous line all  round the eastern South, except for fifty miles where small craft  were concerned and for two hundred miles in the case of larger  vessels. These two hundred miles of land were those between the  Ohio River port of Wheeling and the Navy Yard at Washington.    Nor was this virtual enislement the only advantage to be won. For  while the strong right arm of Union sea-power, facing northward  from the Gulf, could hold the coast, and its sinewy left could  hold the Mississippi, the supple left fingers could feel their  way along the tributary streams until the clutching hand had got  its grip on the whole of the Ohio, Cumberland, Tennessee, Missouri,  Arkansas, and Red rivers. This meant that the North would not only  enjoy the vast advantages of transport by water over transport  by land but that it would cause the best lines of invasion to be  opened up as well.    Of course the South had some sea-power of her own. Nine-tenths of  the United States Navy stood by the Union. But, with the remaining  tenth and some foreign help, the South managed to contrive the  makeshift parts of what might have become a navy if the North had  only let it grow. The North, however, did not let it grow.    The regular navy of the United States, though very small to start  with, was always strong enough to keep the command of the sea and  to prevent the makeshift Southern parts of a navy from ever becoming  a whole. Privateers took out letters of marque to prey on Northern  shipping. But privateering soon withered off, because prizes could  not be run through the blockade in sufficient numbers to make it  pay; and no prize would be recognized except in a Southern port.  Raiders did better and for a much longer time. The _Shenandoah_  was burning Northern whalers in Bering Sea at the end of the war.  The _Sumter_ and the _Florida_ cut a wide swath under instructions  which \"left much to discretion and more to the torch.\" The famous  _Alabama_ only succumbed to the U.S.S. _Kearsarge_ after sinking  the _Hatteras_ man-of-war and raiding seventy other vessels. Yet  still the South, in spite of her ironclads, raiders, and rams, in  spite of her river craft, of the home ships or foreigners that  ran the blockade, and of all her other efforts, was a landsman's  country that could make no real headway against the native sea-power  of the North.    Perhaps the worst of all the disabilities under which the abortive  Southern navy suffered was lubberly administration and gross civilian  interference. The Administration actually refused to buy the beginnings  of a ready-made sea-going fleet when it had the offer of ten British  East Indiamen specially built for rapid conversion into men-of-war.  Forty thousand bales of cotton would have bought the lot. The  Mississippi record was even worse. Five conflicting authorities  divided the undefined and overlapping responsibilities between  them: the Confederate Government, the State governments, the army,  the navy, and the Mississippi skippers. A typical result may be seen  in the fate of the fourteen \"rams\" which were absurdly mishandled by  fourteen independent civilian skippers with two civilian commodores.  This \"River Defense Fleet\" was \"backed by the whole Missouri delegation\"  at Richmond, and blessed by the Confederate Secretary of War, Judah  P. Benjamin, that very clever lawyer-politician and ever-smiling  Jew. Six of the fourteen \"rams\" were lost, with sheer futility,  at New Orleans in April, '62; the rest at Memphis the following  June.    As a matter of fact the Confederate navy never had but one real  man-of-war, the famous _Merrimac_; and she was a mere razee, cut  down for a special purpose, and too feebly engined to keep the  sea. Even the equally famous _Alabama_ was only a raider, never  meant for action with a fleet. Over three hundred officers left  the United States Navy for the South; but, as in the case of the  Army, they were followed by very few men. The total personnel of the  regular Confederate navy never exceeded four thousand at any one time.  The irregular forces afloat often did gallant, and sometimes even  skillful, service in little isolated ways. But when massed together  they were always at sixes and sevens; and they could never do more  than make the best of a very bad business indeed. The Secretary of  the Confederate navy, Stephen R. Mallory, was not to blame. He was  one of the very few civilians who understood and tried to follow  any naval principles at all. He had done good work as chairman of  the Naval Committee in the Senate before the war, and had learnt  a good deal more than his Northern rival, Gideon Welles. He often  saw what should have been done. But men and means were lacking.

His name  has been associated with Mr. Thomas's summary of the Bond propaganda  in the Free State, because, as editor of _The Bloemfontein Express_ up  to the time of his death, early in 1898, he was probably the most  consistent of all the South African exponents of the nationalist  creed. Certainly it is no exaggeration to say that he converted the  Free State of Brand into the Free State of Steyn.             [Footnote 18: Then Judge, afterwards President of the Free           State, and State-Secretary of the South African Republic in           succession to Dr. Leyds.]    [Sidenote: The doctrine of the Bond.]         \"THE BOND PROGRAMME         \"The Afrikander Bond has as final object what is summed up in its       motto of 'Afrika voor de Afrikaners.' The whole of South Africa       belongs by just right to the Afrikander nation. It is the       privilege and duty of every Afrikander to contribute all in his       power towards the expulsion of the English usurper. The States of       South Africa to be federated in one independent Republic.         The Afrikander Bond prepares for this consummation.         Argument in justification:--         (_a_) The transfer of the Cape Colony to the British Government       took place by circumstances of _force majeure_ and without the       consent of the Dutch nation, who renounced all claim in favour of       the Afrikander or Boer nation.         (_b_) Natal is territory which accrued to a contingent of the       Boer nation by purchase from the Zulu king, who received the       consideration agreed for.         (_c_) The British authorities expelled the rightful owners from       Natal by force of arms without just cause.         The task of the Afrikander Bond consists in:         (_a_) Procuring the staunch adhesion and co-operation of every       Afrikander and other real friend of the cause.         (_b_) To obtain the sympathy, the moral and effective aid, of one       or more of the world's Powers.         The means to accomplish those tasks are:         Personal persuasion, Press propaganda, legislation and diplomacy.         The direction of the application of these means is entrusted to a       select body of members eligible for their loyalty to the cause       and their abilities and position. That body will conduct such       measures as need the observance of special secrecy. Upon the rest       of the members will devolve activities of a general character       under the direction of the selected chiefs.         One of the indispensable requisites is the proper organisation of       an effective fund, which is to be regularly sustained. Bond       members will aid each other in all relations of public life in       preference to non-members.         In the efforts of gaining adherence to the cause it is of       importance to distinguish three categories of persons:         (1) The class of Afrikanders who are to some extent deteriorated       by assimilative influences with the English race, whose       restoration to patriotism will need great efforts, discretion,       and patience.         (2) The apparently unthinking and apathetic class who prefer to       relegate all initiative to leaders whom they will loyally follow.       This class is the most numerous by far.         (3) The warmly patriotic class, including men gifted with       intelligence, energy, and speech, qualified as leaders, and apt       to exercise influence over the rest.                *       *       *       *       *         Among these three classes many exist whose views and religious       scruples need to be corrected. Scripture abounds in proofs and       salient analogies applying to the situation and justifying our       cause. In this, as well as in other directions, the members who       work in circulating written propaganda will supply the correct       and conclusive arguments accessible to all.         Upon the basis of our just rights the British Government, if not       the entire nation, is the usurping enemy of the Boer nation.         In dealing with an enemy it is justifiable to employ, besides       force, also means of a less open character, such as diplomacy and       stratagem.    [Sidenote: Anti-british methods.]         The greatest danger to Afrikanderdom is the English policy of       Anglicising the Boer nation--to submerge it by the process of       assimilation.         A distinct attitude of holding aloof from English influences is       the only remedy against that peril and for thwarting that       insidious policy.         It is only such an attitude that will preserve the nation in its       simple faith and habits of morality, and provide safety against       the dangers of contamination and pernicious examples, with all       their fateful consequences to body and soul.         Let the Dutch language have the place of honour in schools and       homes.         Let alliances of marriage with the English be stamped as       unpatriotic.         Let every Afrikander see that he is at all times well armed with       the best possible weapons, and maintains the expert use of the       rifle among young and old, so as to be ready when duty calls, and       the time is ripe for asserting the nation's rights and being rid       of English thraldom.         Employ teachers only who are animated with truly patriotic       sentiments.         Let it be well understood that English domination will also bring       English intolerance and servitude, for it is only a very frail       link which separates the English State Church from actual       Romanism, and its proselytism _en bloc_ is only a matter of short       time.         Equally repugnant and dangerous is England's policy towards the       coloured races, whom she aims, for the sake of industrial profit,       at elevating to equal rank with whites, in direct conflict with       spiritual authority--a policy which incites coloured people to       rivalry with their superiors, and can only end in common       disaster.         Whilst remaining absolutely independent, the ties of blood,       relationship, and language point to Holland for a domestic base.         As to commerce, Germany, America, and other industrial nations       could more than fill the gap left by England, and such       connections should be cultivated as a potent means towards       obtaining foreign support to our cause and identification with       it.         If the mineral wealth of the Transvaal and Orange Free State       becomes established--as appears certain from discoveries already       made--England will not rest until these are also hers.         The leopard will retain its spots. The independence of both       Republics is at stake on that account alone, with the risk that       the rightful owners of the land will become the hewers of wood       and drawers of water for the usurpers.         There is no alternative hope for the peace and progress of South       Africa except by the total excision of the British ulcer.         Reliable signs are not wanting to show that our nation is       designed by Providence as the instrument for the recovery of its       rights, and for the chastisement of proud, perfidious       Albion.\"[19]             [Footnote 19: P. 64 _et seq._ of _The Origin of the           Anglo-Boer War Revealed_ (Hodder & Stoughton).]    These brief and disjointed sentences present in their shortest form  arguments and exhortations with which the Dutch population of the Free  State, the Transvaal, and the Cape Colony, were familiarised through  the Press, the pulpit, the platform, and through individual  intercourse and advocacy, from the time of the Retrocession in 1881  onwards. It is in effect the scheme of a Bond \"worked out more in  detail by some friends at Bloemfontein,\" as published by Borckenhagen  in his paper, _The Bloemfontein Express_, on April 7th, 1881, to which  Du Toit, the founder of the Bond in the Cape Colony, referred in the  pamphlet, _De Transvaalse Oorlog_ (The Transvaal War), which he issued  from his press at the Paarl later on in the same year. The nationalist  creed, as thus formulated, was preached consistently in the Free  State; but in the Cape Colony it was modified by Hofmeyr to meet the  exigencies of Colonial politics.    None the less it was in the Cape Colony that the Bond, as a political  organisation, was destined to find its chief sphere of action. In the  Free State it was discouraged by President Brand, and in point of fact  the British population was too insignificant a factor in the politics  of the central republic to make it necessary to maintain a distinct  organisation for the promotion of nationalist sentiment. In the  Transvaal, again, the Bond maintained no regular organisation. And  this for two reasons. Every burgher of the northern Republic was  sufficiently animated by the anti-British sentiments which it was  intended to promote; and the only \"constitution\" which the Transvaal  Dutch would accept was one which embodied principles so flagrantly  inconsistent with submission to British authority that it could not be  adopted by the branches of the Bond in the Cape Colony without  exposing its members to immediate"]]]
