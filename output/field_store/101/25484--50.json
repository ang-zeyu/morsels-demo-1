The following figure (taken from the 'Oriental  Annual') is so much like the portrait of Warren Hastings's Yak, that it  might almost be taken for a copy of it.    [Illustration]    There is the skin of a Yak in the Zoological Museum, which coincides  pretty nearly with the foregoing description. There is also a stuffed  specimen of a female in the British Museum.    Like the European Bison, the skeleton of the Yak has fourteen pairs of  ribs. Period of gestation not recorded.          THE GYALL, (_Bos Frontalis_ of Lambert;)    THE GAYAL, (_Bos Gavaeus_ of Colebrooke;)    THE JUNGLY GAU, (_Bos Sylhetanus_ of F. Cuvier.)      Of the animals named in the foregoing list, we have had several very  interesting accounts; but none of these have been sufficiently precise  to enable us to determine the specific character of the animals  described.    Are they, as some affirm, merely different names for the same animal; or  do they designate animals which are really and truly distinct?    Nothing short of an appeal to structure can satisfactorily settle this  or any other disputed point of a similar nature; but, unfortunately for  zoology, the opportunities for such appeals are rare, and, when they do  occur, are seldom taken advantage of. Let us hope that this hint will  not be lost on some of our intelligent countrymen in the East; and that  before long we may be favoured with the result of their researches.    In the meantime, and in order to facilitate as much as possible the  endeavours of those who may have opportunities for such inquiries, the  following epitome is given of the various papers which have already  appeared on the subject, but which, in their present scattered form, are  of very little general utility.          THE GYALL.      The earliest descriptive notice we have of the Gyall was that given in a  paper read before the Linnean Society, in 1802, by Mr. Lambert, on the  occasion of a bull of this species arriving in London from India.    \"_Bos Frontalis._    \"General colour a blueish-black; the frontal fascia gray; the horns  short, thick, and distant at their bases, the tail nearly naked,  slender, and with a tuft at the end. The Gyall has no mane; its coat is  soft; the edge of the under lip is white, and is fringed with bristling  hair. The horns are pale, with their bases included in the frontal  fascia.\"    [Illustration: The Gyall, reduced--from the Linnean Transactions.]    The animal of which this description is given, appeared to be between  two and three years old, very tame, and inoffensive. A drawing was  taken of it, which was engraved and published in the Linnean  Transactions.    The following are its dimensions:                                                                    Ft.   In.

Some parts of the drawing seem to be rather too  much enlarged, as in the base of the horns, and the rising between the  fore shoulders.    \"The animal I described to you, and which I have kept and reared these  last seven years, and know by the name of the Gyall, is a native of the  hills to the north east and east of the Company's province of  Chittagong, in Bengal, inhabiting that range of hills which separates it  from the country of Arracan.    \"The male Gyall is like our Bull in shape and appearance, but I conceive  not quite so tall; it is of a blackish-brown colour; the horns short,  but thick and strong towards the base, round which, and across the  frons, the hair is bushy, and of a dirty white colour; the chest and  forehead are broad and thick. He is naturally very bold, and will defend  himself against any of the beasts of prey.    \"The female differs a little in appearance; her horns are not quite so  large, and her make is somewhat more slender. She is very quiet, and is  used for all the purposes of the dairy; as also, (I have been informed  by the natives,) for tilling the ground, and is more tractable than the  Buffalo. The milk which these cows give has a peculiar richness in it,  arising, I should conceive, from their always feeding on the young  shoots and branches of trees in preference to grass.    [Illustration: (Head of Gyall, from Linnean Transactions.)]    \"I constantly made it a practice to allow them to range abroad, amongst  the hills and jungles at Chittagong, during the day, to browse; a keeper  attending to prevent their straying so far as to endanger losing them.  They do not thrive so well in any part of Bengal as in the  afore-mentioned province, and in the adjoining one, Pipperah, where, I  believe, the animal is also to be found. I have heard of a female Gyall  breeding with a common Bull. I wish it were in my power to give you more  particulars, but I am describing entirely from memory.\"    In February, 1804, Mr. Lambert again addressed the Linnean Society on  the same subject. He says, \"Since I presented to the Society the last  account of the Bos Frontalis, or Gyall of India, Mr. Fleming, a  gentleman who has just returned from that country, has very obligingly  communicated to me the following further particulars. This account was  transmitted to Mr. Fleming by Mr. Macrae, resident at Chittagong, in a  letter, dated March 22, 1802, and was accompanied with a drawing, by  which it appears that the animal from which my figure was taken was full  grown.\" (See the figure, p. 51.)      MR. MACRAE'S ACCOUNT.    The Gyall is a species of cow peculiar to the mountains, which form the  eastern boundary of the province of Chittagong, where it is found  running wild in the woods; and it is also reared as a domestic animal by  the Kookies, or Lunclas, the inhabitants of those hills. It delights to  live in the deepest jungles, feeding on the tender leaves and shoots of  the brushwood; and is never met with on the plains below, except when  brought there. Such of them as have been kept by the gentlemen at  Chittagong, have always preferred browsing among the thickets on the  adjacent hills to feeding on the grass of the plains.    It is of a dull heavy appearance, yet of a form that indicates both  strength and activity; and approaches nearly to that of the wild  Buffalo. Its head is set on like the Buffalo's, and it carries it much  in the same manner, with the nose projecting forward; but in the shape  of the head it differs materially from both the Buffalo and the Cow, the  head of the Gyall being much shorter from the crown to the nose, but  much broader between the horns than that of either. The withers and  shoulders of the Gyall rise higher in proportion than those of Buffalo  or Cow, and its tail is small and short, seldom falling lower than the  bend in the ham. Its colour is in general brown, varying from a light to  a deep shade; it has at times a white forehead, and _white legs_, with a  white belly and brush. The hair of the belly is invariably of a lighter  colour than that of the back and flanks. The Gyall calf is of a dull red  colour, which gradually changes to a brown as it advances in age.    The female Gyall receives the bull at three years of age; her term of  gestation is eleven months, when she brings forth, and does not again  admit the male until the second year thereafter, thus producing a calf  once in three years only. So long an interval between each birth must  tend to make the species rare. In the length of time she goes with  young, as well as in that between each conception, the Gyall differs  from the Buffalo and Cow. The Gyall does not give much milk, but what  she yields is nearly as rich as the cream of other milk. The calf sucks  its dam for eight or nine months, when it is capable of supporting  itself. The Kookies tie up the calf until he is sufficiently strong to  do so.    The Gyalls live to the age of from fifteen to twenty. They lose their  sight as they grow old, and are subject to a disease of the hoof, which  often proves fatal at an early age. When the Kookies consider the  disease beyond the hope of cure, he kills the animal and eats the  flesh, which constitutes his first article of luxury.    The Kookies have a very simple method of catching the wild Gyalls, which  is as follows:--On discovering a herd of wild Gyalls in the jungles,  they prepare a number of balls, of the size of a man's head, composed of  a particular kind of earth, salt, and cotton. They then drive their tame  Gyalls towards the wild ones, when the two herds soon meet, and  assimilate into one; the males of the one attaching themselves to the  females of the other, and _vice versa_. The Kookies now scatter their  balls over such parts of the jungle as they think the herd most likely  to pass, and watch its motions. The Gyalls, on meeting these balls as  they pass along, are attracted by their appearance and smell, and begin  to lick them with their tongues; and relishing the taste of the salt,  and the particular earth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27977"],[0,"Austral English (#9)"],[1," of December 21st, 1817, [he]says  . . . `the Continent of Australia, which, I hope, will be the  name given to this country in future, instead of the very  erroneous and misapplied name hitherto given it of New Holland,  which, properly speaking, only applies to a part of this  immense Continent.'\"    1883.
