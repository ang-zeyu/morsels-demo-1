[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#9)"],[1,", there is, it seems to me, good reason to believe that  the diversities in note have come to have a distinct conventional  value between the individuals of all the different breeds. Any one who  closely observes these animals must have noticed the fact that the  degree of attention they give to the utterances of their kindred  varies in a way which indicates that they have great varieties of  denotations. Some of the shades of the meaning which a dog's bark has  to others of his species probably escape our less fine ears.    The creation of something like a language among our civilized dogs  has naturally been accompanied by the development of an understanding  of human speech. Although we cannot attach much importance to the  mass of anecdote on this point, there is enough which is well  attested--sufficient, indeed, which has come within the limits of my  own observation--to make it clear that dogs, even without deliberate  teaching, frequently acquire a tolerably clear understanding of a  number of words and even of short phrases. They will catch these not  only when given in distinct command, but when uttered in an ordinary  tone, without any sign that they relate to their affairs. It is true  that these understood words generally relate to some action which the  dog is accustomed to perform, yet there are instances so well  attested that they deserve credit, which seem to show that the  creatures can get some sense of the drift of conversation even when  it is carried on by persons with whom they are not familiar and does  not clearly relate to their own affairs.    It should be observed that within the narrow limits of this essay little  or no effort has been made to interpret the state of mind of dogs from  the vast but rather untrustworthy mass of anecdote with which our books  are filled. So large a part of this evidence is contaminated by  prepossessions, and a yet larger part is so unverified in any scientific  sense, that for purposes of sound inquiry it is worthless. It therefore  seems best to limit ourselves, as has been done in this paper, to those  general actions of the creatures which are matters of common knowledge  and safely beyond question. From these indices we are able to determine  a basis for some important conclusions. These are in effect as follows,  viz.: Our domestic dog is derived from a species, one or more, akin to  the wolf, the jackal, and the fox; to a group of animals not  characterized by great native intelligence, but distinguished for their  ferocity and their general untamableness. There is no reason to believe  that the primitive dog had any more foundation for his great attainments  than his obstinately savage kindred, except that he may have had a  greater disposition to form an attachment to a master. We can hardly  believe that he had any share of that marvellous sympathy with man  and understanding of his motives which characterize the high-bred  varieties of his species. All this vast transformation, which from a  psychological point of view has carried the dog relatively as far up  above his origin as civilization has lifted man above his lowest  estate, has been due to human intercourse and the long and effective  concomitant selection of good from bad. It is hardly too much to say  that a large part of our human nature has been transferred into the  descendants of this ancient wild beast. The sense of property, a great  part of human affections, many of the attributes which constitute the  gentleman, have been passed over to him.    In considering the effects arising from the intercourse of man with the  dog, we should not overlook the development of human sympathy which has  come about through this relation. The fact that the dog has been made by  far the most sympathetic of the lower animals, is due to the affection  which men for thousands of years have given to him. In his intercourse  with this creature, man first learned to develop his altruistic motives  beyond the limits of his own kind. With this extension of his affection  must have begun the growth of that large motive, which is the most  distinguishing feature of our modern life, which leads us to go forth in  a loving manner to the living beings about us, not only to our flocks  and herds but to the life of the unsubjugated realm as well. Thus, in a  way, we may look upon the dog as affording the first steps on the path  of culture which was to lift man from his primitive selfishness to the  altruistic state to which he has attained.    Great as has been the work of man upon the dog--it deserves, indeed,  to be ranked high among all the accomplishments of his culture--there  is reason to believe that if he but go forward with understanding in  the ways which have hitherto led him blindly to his success, the  final result may be very much more perfect than that which has been  attained. It is on this account that I feel it fit to make a strong  protest against the system our breeders pursue. Except in the case of  dogs used in sport and for herding sheep, the sole effort appears to  be to create breeds which shall exhibit peculiarities of form which  are mere extravagances, and move the real lover of this noble animal  to indignation. In these preposterous and unseemly tasks no care is  taken to continue the mental development on lines which have been  established by long use. Still less is there any effort to essay the  development of the intelligence in ways which are clearly open to us,  and which afford possibilities of lifting this species to a yet  nobler companionship with our own kind.    It seems worth while for our associations of dog fanciers to undertake  to develop varieties of dogs solely with reference to the intellectual  qualities of the animal. I venture to suggest that those who seek this  end should select some of the primitive types of form, such as are  found among the undifferentiated mass of the species, those which are  improperly termed mongrels, and this for the reason that among these  unselected creatures the intelligence is quicker and more varied than  it is in the highly developed varieties. Under skilful trainers the  successive generations bred in the experimental station should be  subjected to tests which will indicate the measure of intellectual  ability. The results already attained by the unconscious selection  which man has applied serve to indicate that at the end of a century,  and perhaps in much less time, we might develop an animal which in  various ways would come to a closer intellectual relation with man than  any other lower species has attained.    Cats deserve some mention for the reason, that, while they are the least  essential, and on the whole the least interesting, of domesticated  animals, they have had a certain place in civilization. They afford,  moreover, a capital foil by which to set off the virtues of the dog.  Nowhere else, indeed, among the creatures which are intimately  associated with men, do we find two related forms which afford, along  with a certain likeness, such great diversities of quality.    We know nothing as to the time when the cat first found its way to the  associations of man. Presumably this period was much later than the  advent of the dog into the human family. The presumption rests upon the  fact that while the dog does not demand fixed residence as a condition  of its fealty, but is at home wherever his master is, the cat is the  creature of the domicile, caring more indeed for its dwelling-place than  it ever does for the inmates thereof. In a word, the creature must have  come to us after our forefathers gave up the nomadic life.  Nevertheless, the association is very ancient; it has endured in Egypt  at least for a term of several thousand years.    Among the curious features connected with the association of the cat  with man, we may note that it is the only animal which has been  tolerated, esteemed, and at times worshipped, without having a  single distinctly valuable quality. It is, in a small way,  serviceable in keeping down the excessive development of small  rodents, which from the beginning have been the self-invited guests  of man. As it is in a certain indifferent way sympathetic, and by  its caresses appears to indicate affection, it has awakened a  measure of sympathy which it hardly deserves. I have been unable to  find any authentic instances which go to show the existence in cats  of any real love for their masters.    In the matter of intelligence cats appear to rank almost as high as  dogs. They are even quicker than their canine relatives in  discerning the nature of man's artful contrivances; they readily  acquire the habit of opening doors which are closed by means of a  latch, even where it is necessary to combine the strong pull on the  handle with the push that completes the operation. Feats of this  sort are rarely if ever performed by dogs.    The most peculiar quality in the mind of cats is the intense way in  which they cling to a well-known locality. Their memory of places, and  affection for them, if we may so term it, is evidently far greater  than that which they feel for people. Some years ago I had an  interesting exhibition of this singular humor. A well-grown and  thoroughly domesticated cat, one that seemed more than usually  attached to people, was brought from my house in town to a place on  the shore. When released, the creature seemed for some days to be  nearly insane. It did not recognize any of its friends, it betook  itself to the fields, and was with difficulty captured at the end  of a week of roaming, during which it appeared to have had no food.  Confined within one room, it gradually recovered its powers of mind,  and began to take account of its friends. In the course of a month it  seemed to be reconciled to its surroundings. Nine months after its  first sojourn in the wilderness it was again brought from the town to  the same place. On the second visit "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2557"],[0,"Old Mother West Wind (#9)"],[1,"t, and a whole lot of little Trouts. There were so  many little Trouts that Mr. Trout and Mrs. Trout were kept very busy  indeed getting breakfast and dinner and supper for them, and watching  out for them and teaching them how to swim and how to catch foolish  little flies that sometimes fell on the water and how to keep out of  the way of big hungry fish and sharp eyed Mr. Kingfisher and big men and  little boys who came fishing with hooks and lines.    Now all the little Trouts were very, very good and minded just what Mrs.  Trout told them--all but Tommy Trout, for Tommy Trout--oh, dear, dear!  Tommy Trout never could mind right away. He always had to wait a little  instead of minding when he was spoken to.    Tommy Trout didn't mean to be bad. Oh dear, no! He just wanted to have  his own way, and because Tommy Trout had his own way and didn't mind  Mrs. Trout there isn't any Tommy Trout now. No sir, there isn't as much  as one little blue spot of his beautiful little coat left because--why,  just because Tommy Trout didn't mind.    One day when round, red Mr. Sun was shining and the Laughing Brook was  singing on its way to join the Big River, Mrs. Trout started to get some  nice plump flies for dinner. All the little Trouts were playing in their  dear little pool, safe behind the Big Rock. Before she started Mrs.  Trout called all the little Trouts around her and told them not to  leave their little pool while she was gone, \"For,\" said she, \"something  dreadful might happen to you.\"    All the little Trouts, except Tommy Trout, promised that they would  surely, surely stay inside their dear little pool. Then they all began  to jump and chase each other and play as happy as could be, all but  Tommy Trout.    As soon as Mrs. Trout had started, Tommy Trout swam off by himself to  the edge of the pool. \"I wonder what is on the other side of the Big  Rock,\" said Tommy Trout. \"The sun is shining and the brook is laughing  and nothing could happen if I go just a little speck of a ways.\"    So, when no one was looking, Tommy Trout slipped out of the safe little  pool where all the other little Trouts were playing. He swam just a  little speck of a ways farther still. Now he could see almost around  the Big Rock. Then he swam just a little speck of a ways farther and--oh  dear, dear! he looked right into the mouth of a great big, big fish  called Mr. Pickerel, who is very fond of little Trouts and would like to  eat one for breakfast every day.    \"Ah ha!\" said Mr. Pickerel, opening his big, big mouth very, very wide.    Tommy Trout turned to run back to the dear, dear safe little pool where  all the other little Trouts were playing so happily, but he was too  late. Into that great big, big mouth he went instead, and Mr. Pickerel  swallowed him whole.    \"Ah ha,\" said Mr. Pickerel, \"I like little Trouts.\"    And nothing more was ever heard of Tommy Trout, who didn't mind.        CHAPTER XVI SPOTTY THE TURTLE WINS A RACE    All the little people who live on the Green Meadows and in the Smiling  Pool and along the Laughing Brook were to have a holiday. The Merry  Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind had been very busy, oh very busy  indeed, in sending word to all the little meadow folks. You see, Peter  Rabbit had been boasting of how fast he could run. Reddy Fox was quite  sure that he could run faster than Peter Rabbit. Billy Mink, who can  move so quickly you hardly can see him, was quite sure that neither  Peter Rabbit nor Reddy Fox could run as fast as he. They all met one  day beside the Smiling Pool and agreed that old Grandfather Frog should  decide who was the swiftest.    Now Grandfather Frog was accounted very wise. You see he had lived a  long time, oh, very much longer than any of the others, and therefore,  because of the wisdom of age, Grandfather Frog was always called on to  decide all disputes. He sat on his green lily-pad while Billy Mink sat  on the Big Rock, and Peter Rabbit and Reddy Fox sat on the bank. Each  in turn told why he thought he was the fastest. Old Grandfather Frog  listened and listened and said never a word until they were all through.  When they had finished, he stopped to catch a foolish green fly and then  he said: \"The best way to decide who is the swiftest is to have a race.\"    So it was agreed that Peter Rabbit and Reddy Fox and Billy Mink should  start together from the old butternut tree on one edge of the Green  Meadows, race away across the Green Meadows to the little hill on the  other side and each bring back a nut from the big hickory which grew  there. The one who first reached the old butternut tree with a hickory  nut would be declared the winner. The Merry Little Breezes flew about  over the Green Meadows telling everyone about the race and everyone  planned to be there.    It was a beautiful summer day. Mr. Sun smiled and smiled, and the  more he smiled the warmer it grew. Everyone was there to see the  race--Striped Chipmunk, Happy Jack Squirrel, Sammy Jay, Blacky the Crow,  Hooty the Owl and Bobby Coon all sat up in the old butternut tree where  it was cool and shady. Johnny Chuck, Jerry Muskrat, Jimmy Skunk, Little  Joe Otter, Grandfather Frog and even old Mr. Toad, were there. Last of  all came Spotty the Turtle. Now Spotty the Turtle is a very slow walker,  and he cannot run at all. When Peter Rabbit saw him coming up towards  the old butternut tree he shouted: \"Come, Spotty, don't you want to race  with us?\"    Everybody laughed because you know Spotty is so very, very slow but  Spotty didn't laugh and he didn't get cross because everyone else  laughed.    \"There is a wise old saying, Peter Rabbit,\" said Spotty the Turtle,  \"which shows that those who run fastest do not always reach a place  first. I think I WILL enter this race.\"    Every one thought that that was the best joke they had heard for a long  time, and all laughed harder than ever. They all agreed that Spotty the  Turtle should start in the race too.    So they all stood in a row, Peter Rabbit first, the Billy Mink, then  Reddy Fox, and right side of Reddy Fox Spotty the Turtle.    \"Are you ready?\" asked Grandfather Frog. \"Go!\"    Away went Peter Rabbit with great big jumps. After him went Billy Mink  so fast that was just a little brown streak going through the tall  grass, and side by side with him ran Reddy Fox. Now just as they started  Spotty the Turtle reached up and grabbed the long hair on the end of  Reddy's big tail. Of course Reddy couldn't have stopped to shake him  off, because Peter Rabbit and Billy Mink were running so fast that he  had to run his very best to keep up with them. But he didn't even know  that Spotty the Turtle was there. You see Spotty is not very heavy and  Reddy Fox was so excited that he did not notice that his big tail was  heavier than usual.    The Merry Little Breezes flew along, too, to see that the race was fair.  Peter Rabbit went with great big jumps. Whenever he came to a little  bush he jumped right over it, for Peter Rabbit's legs are long and meant  for jumping. Billy Mink is so slim that he slipped between the bushes  and through the long grass like a little brown streak. Reddy Fox, who is  bigger than either Peter Rabbit or Billy Mink, had no trouble in keeping  up with them. Not one of them noticed that Spotty the Turtle was hanging  fast to the end of Reddy's tail.    Now just at the foot of the little hill on which the big hickory tree  grew was a little pond. It wasn't very wide but it was quite long. Billy  Mink remembered this pond and he chuckled to himself as he raced along,  for he knew that Peter Rabbit couldn't swim and he knew that Reddy Fox  does not like the water, so therefore both would have to run around it.  He himself can swim even faster than he can run. The more he thought of  this, the more foolish it seemed that he should hurry so on such a warm  day. \"For,\" said Billy Mink to himself, \"even if they reach the pond  first, they will have to run around it, while I can swim across it and  cool off while I am swimming. I will surely get there first.\" So Billy  Mink ran slower and slower, and pretty soon he had dropped behind.    Mr. Sun, round and red, looking down, smiled and smiled to see the race.  The more he smiled the warmer it grew. Now, Peter Rabbit had a thick  gray coat and Reddy Fox had a thick red coat, and they both began to get  very, very warm. Peter Rabbit did not make such long jumps as when he  first started. Reddy Fox began to feel very thirsty, and his tongue hung  out. Now that Billy Mink was behind them they thought they did not need  to hurry so.    Peter Rabbit reached the little pond first. He had not thought of that  pond when he agreed to enter the race. He stopped right on the edge  of it and sat up on his hind legs. Right across he could see the big  hickory tree, so near and yet so far, for he knew that he must run  around the pond then back again, and it was a long, long way. In just  a moment Reddy Fox ran out of the bushes and Reddy felt much as  Peter Rabbit did. Way, way behind them was Billy Mink, trotting along  comfortably and chuckling to himself. Peter Rabbit looked at Reddy Fox  in dismay, and Reddy Fox looked at Peter Rabbit in dismay. Then they  both looked at Billy Mink and remembered that Billy Mink could swim  right across.    Then off Peter Rabbit started as fast as he could go around the pond one  way, and Reddy Fox started around the pond the other way. They were  so excited that neither noticed a little splash in the pond. That was  Spotty the Turtle who had let go of Reddy's tail and now was swimming  across the pond, for you know that Spotty is a splendid swimmer. Only  once or twice he stuck his little black nose up to get some air. The  rest of the time he swam under water and no one but the Merry Little  Breezes saw him. Right across he swam, and climbed up the bank right  under the big hickory tree.    Now there were just three nuts left under the hickory trees. Two"]]]
