By this arrangement all the wall-bolts are inside, and       those of the floor underneath it, which protects them not only from       the weather but from theft, an iron bolt being a great temptation       to country people on account of its convenience and utility. The       walls are bolted to the floor, which gives great strength to the       whole structure, and the panels are carefully ordered, like the       stones in a well-built wall, so that the joints of the lower course       of panels do not fall below those of the upper. The roof is arched       and provides a current of fresh air, by placing ventilators at each       end of the arch, which insures a current without inconvenience to       the occupant.    The chapters on \"Concerning Moonlight in Old Castles,\" \"The Coming of  the Clouds,\" and the little sketches, like \"Loch Awe after Sunset,  Sept. 23, 1860,\" enchanted me. It had not before struck me that Loch  Awe was different on September 23, 1860, from what it was at other  times, or--to carry the idea further--that the imperial Delaware had  changed since that momentous time when George Washington crossed it, or  the Schuylkill since Tom Moore looked upon it.    To quote further:         The mountain is green-grey, colder and greener towards the summit.       All details of field and wood are dimly visible. Two islands nearer       me are distinct against the hill, but their foliage seems black,       and no details are visible in them. The sky is all clouded over.       From the horizon to the zenith it is one veil of formless vapour.    And:         There is one streak of dead calm, which reflects the green mountain       perfectly from edge to edge of it. There is another calm shaped       like a great river, which is all green, touched with crimson.       Besides these there are delicate half calms, just dulled over with       faint breathings of the evening air; these, for the most part being       violet (from the sky), except at a distance, where they take a deep       crimson; and there is one piece of crimson calm near me set between       a faint violet breeze and a calm of a different violet. There are       one or two breezes sufficiently strong to cause ripple, and these       rippled spaces take the dull grey slate of the upper sky.         Realise this picture as well as you may be able, and then put in       the final touch. Between the dull calms and the glassy calms there       are drawn thin threads of division burning with scarlet fire.         This fire is of course got from the lower sky. I know whence it       comes, but how or why it lies in those thin scarlet threads there       where it is most wanted, and not elsewhere, I cannot satisfactorily       explain.    Then there was a delightful and illuminating chapter called \"A Stream at  Rest.\" Hamerton, who is probably now very much out of fashion, taught me  the necessity of beauty in life; and, as an accessory to Emerson, the  philosophy of enjoying the little, every-day things. It was Emerson who,  I think, said first to me, \"Take short outlooks\"; and I still think that  there can be no better introduction to a consideration of the relation  of art to nature than \"A Painter's Camp.\" It was \"A Painter's Camp\"  which led me to \"The Intellectual Life.\" There is a particular passage  in Hamerton's chapter on \"A Little French City\" that emphasized the need  of beauty.         The cathedral is all poetry; I mean that every part of it affects       our emotional nature either by its own grandeur or beauty, or by       its allusion to histories of bright virtue or brave fortitude. And       this emotional result is independent of belief in the historical       truth of these great legends: it would be stronger, no doubt, if we       believed them, but we are still capable of feeling their solemn       poetry and large significance as we feel the poetry and       significance of \"Sir Galahad\" or \"The Idylls of the King.\"         Some persons are so constituted that it is necessary to their       happiness to live near some noble work of art or nature. A mountain       is satisfactory to them because it is great and ever new,       presenting itself every hour under aspects so unforeseen that one       can gaze at it for years with unflagging interest. To some minds,       to mine amongst others, human life is scarcely supportable far from       some stately and magnificent object, worthy of endless study and       admiration. But what of life in the plains? Truly, most plains are       dreary enough, but still they may have fine trees, or a cathedral.       And in the cathedral, here, I find no despicable compensation for       the loss of dear old Ben Cruacha.    There are some humorous and perhaps even comic passages in \"The  Intellectual Life\"; these passages are unconsciously humorous or comic,  as Mr. Philip Gilbert Hamerton seems to have no sense of humour. For  instance, it was a great surprise to me to discover that poverty was  unfavourable to the intellectual life! It was enlightening to know the  reason why a man should wear evening dress after six o'clock, and why  the sporting of gray clothes in the evening was unworthy of the  Intellectual! Besides, it affects the character!    And letter XI \"To a Master of Arts who said that a Certain Distinguished  Painter was Half-educated,\" was a useful antidote to youthful  self-conceit. I had not reached the stage, treated in the chapters on  \"Women and Marriage,\" \"To a Young Gentleman Who Contemplated Marriage,\"  but I thought the author very wise indeed, and found many other pages  which were intensely stimulating. Let others decry Hamerton if they  like; I owe a great deal to him; and, though I might be induced to throw  \"The Intellectual Life\" to the Young Wolves of the Beginning of this  Century, I shall always insist that \"A Painter's Camp\" ought to be  included in every list of books.    It was George Eliot who sent me to \"The Following of Christ,\" and she  interested me in Saint Teresa, that illustrious woman so well compounded  of mysticism and common sense, of whom, however, I could find no good  \"Life.\" But Thomas [`a] Kempis was a revelation! He fitted into nearly  every crisis of the soul, but all his words are not for every-day life.  He seems to demand too much of us poor folk of the world. Later, I came  to understand that the counsel of perfection which Christ gave to the  rich young man was not intended for the whole world, and many fine  passages in [`A] Kempis were meant for finer temperaments than my own.    Somebody at this time presented me with a copy of Marcus Aurelius. I  found him dull, stale, and unprofitable in comparison with [`A] Kempis. His  philosophy of life seemed to lead to nothing except the cultivation of a  very high opinion of oneself. I gave this conclusion to one of my  English friends, who objected to my uncharted course of reading, and he  said, \"A person like you who finds nothing humorous or even  philosophical in 'Alice in Wonderland' cannot be expected to like the  works of Marcus Aurelius!\"    It takes a prig to divide his reading into nicely staked off little  plots, each with its own date. The art of injudicious reading, the art  of miscellaneous reading which every normal man ought to cultivate, is a  very fine and satisfactory art; for the best guide to books is a book  itself. It clasps hands with a thousand other books. It has always  seemed to me that \"Sesame and Lilies\" would not have been conceived by  Ruskin if he had not heard well an echo of \"The Following of Christ.\"  There was a time when the lovers of Ruskin who wanted to read \"The  Stones of Venice\" and the rest at leisure, felt themselves obliged to  form clubs, and to divide the expense, if they were of moderate means,  in order to get what was good out of him. But somehow or other, probably  because it appealed more to everybody, it was always possible to find a  copy of \"Sesame and Lilies\" at an old book stand. I think I found one  most unexpectedly at Leary's in Philadelphia, where I also discovered  the copy of Froissart. The Froissart, as I have said, cost me just half  of my father's Christmas present that year, which was five dollars. I  must have managed to get the Ruskin volume out of some other fund, for I  had many things to buy with the other two and one half dollars!    Ruskin is left alone to-day; he does not seem to fill that \"long-felt  want\" which we, the young of the sixties and seventies, admitted. No  doubt he is very mannered in his style, mitred and coped when he might  have been very simple in his raiment. He was a priest in literature and  art; and he clothed himself as a priest. He marched with a stately  tread, and yet he stooped to the single violets by the wayside.    By the way, I often wished when I was reading Ruskin, who once made  apple blossoms fashionable, that he had led a crusade against the double  and the triple violet, which have destroyed the reputation of the real  violet. What can be more repellent to the lovers of simplicity than a  bunch of these artificialities, without perfume, tied by dark green  ribbon, and with all their leaves removed? \"Sesame and Lilies\" had the  effect of sending me back to the single violet whenever I was inclined  to admire the _camellia japonica_ or any other thing that was  artificial, or distorted from beauty or simplicity.    Circumstances have a great deal to do with our affection for books.  Propinquity, they say, leads very frequently to marriage, and if a book  happens to be near and if it is any kind of book at all, there is a  great temptation to develop an affection for it. All I can say is that I  think that \"Sesame and Lilies\" is a good book, for after all a book must  be judged by its effect. It led me further into Ruskin, and helped me to  acquire a reverence for art and to estimate the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#9)"],[1,"would have astonished him very much.    Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means  prepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no  shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five  minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.  All this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze  of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the  hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen  ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;  and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an  interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the  consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you  or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the  predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would  unquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that  the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining  room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea  taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in  his slippers to the door.    The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by  his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.    It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone  a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with  living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which  bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,  and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been  scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as  that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,  or Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the  floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,  brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,  mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,  cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense  twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim  with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a  jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not  unlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on  Scrooge as he came peeping round the door.    'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'    Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was  not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were  clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.    'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'    Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,  or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the  figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be  warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the  ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no  other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining  icicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial  face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its  unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was  an antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was  eaten up with rust.    'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.    'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.    'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning  (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'  pursued the Phantom.    'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have you  had many brothers, Spirit?'    'More than eighteen hundred,' said the Ghost.    'A tremendous family to provide for,' muttered Scrooge.    The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.    'Spirit,' said Scrooge submissively, 'conduct me where you will. I went  forth last night on compulsion, and I learned a lesson which is working  now. To-night if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.'    'Touch my robe!'    Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.    Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry,  brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch,  all vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the  hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning,  where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk  and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement  in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence  it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the  road below, and splitting into artificial little snowstorms.    The house-fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker,  contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with  the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed  up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons: furrows  that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great  streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the  thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest  streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen,  whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all  the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were  blazing away to their dear heart's content. There was nothing very  cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of  cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer  sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.    [Illustration: THERE WAS NOTHING VERY CHEERFUL IN THE CLIMATE]    For the people who were shovelling away on the house-tops were jovial  and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now  and then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured missile far  than many a wordy jest--laughing heartily if it went right, and not less  heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open,  and the fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great,  round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of  jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the  street in their apoplectic opulence: There were ruddy, brown-faced,  broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their growth  like Spanish friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at  the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up  mistletoe. There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming  pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers'  benevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths might  water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and  brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and  pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were  Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the  oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy  persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper  bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth  among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and  stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going  on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in  slow and passionless excitement.    The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters  down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone  that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that  the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters  were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended  scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the  raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the  sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious,  the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the  coldest lookers-on feel faint, and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that  the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in  modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything  was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all  so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they  tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets  wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running  back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the  best humour possible; while the grocer and his people were so frank and  fresh, that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons  behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection,  and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.    But soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel, and  away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes and  with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged, from scores  of by-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people,  carrying their dinners to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor  revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with  Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and, taking off the covers as  their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch.  And it was a very"]]]
