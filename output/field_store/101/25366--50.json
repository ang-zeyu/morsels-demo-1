Sound  or scent, or both, had been arrested by some unusual presence. And he  paused to verify the warning.    As he stood there, an instant, in the shade-flecked driveway, the girl  saw he was a collie; massive, graceful, majestic; in the full strength  of his early prime; his shaggy coat of burnished mahogany-and-snow  glinting back the showers of sun-rays that filtered down through the  leaves.    Before the watching girl could take further note of him, the dog's  aspect of tense listening merged into certainty. With no further shadow  of doubt as to direction, he set off at a sweeping run past the house  and toward the point.    He ran with head down; and with tawny ruff abristle. There was  something in his lithe gallop that was as ominous as it was beautiful.  And, nervous at the great collie's approach, the girl squealed.    It had been a dull morning for Lad. The Mistress was in town for the  day. The Master was shut up in his study, hard at work. And, for once,  he had not remembered to call Lad to a resting place on the study rug;  before closing the door on the outside world. Alone and bored, the  collie had wandered into the woods; in quest of possible rabbits to  chase or squirrels to tree. Finding the sport tame, he started  homeward. Midway down the drive, his supersensitive nostrils caught the  whiff of alien humans on the Place. At the same time, he heard the  raucous gabbling of several voices. Though his near-sighted eyes did  not yet show the intruders to him, yet scent and sound made it  ridiculously easy for him to trace them.    From early puppyhood, Lad had been the official guardian of the Place.  He knew the limits of its thirty acres; from lake to highroad; from  boundary fence to boundary fence. He knew, too, that visitors must not  be molested as long as they were on the driveway; but that no stranger  might be allowed to cross the land, by any other route; or to trespass  on lawn or oak-grove.    And now, apparently, strangers were holding some sort of unlicensed  revelry, down on the point. His sense of smell told him that neither  the Master nor anyone else belonging to the Place was with them. True  watchdog indignation swelled up in Lad's heart. And he ran at top speed.    The girl's three companions, turning at sight of her gesturing hand,  beheld a mahogany-and-white thunderbolt whizzing down the hundred-yard  slope toward them.    It chanced that both the men had served long apprenticeship as  dog-fanciers; and that both of them knew collies. Thus, no second look  was needed. One glimpse of the silently charging Lad told them all they  needed to know. Not in this way does a blatant or bluffing watchdog  seek to shoo off trespassers. This giant collie, with his lowered head  and glinting fangs and ruffling hackles, meant business. And the men  acted accordingly.    \"Run for it!\" bellowed one of them; setting a splendid example by  reaching the beached canoe at a single scrambling bound. The second man  was no whit behind him. Between them, the canoe, at one shove, was  launched. The first man grabbed one of the girls by the arm and  propelled her into the wobbling craft; while the other shoved off. The  remaining girl,--she of the azure headgear and the verdant  waist,--slipped on the grassy bank, in her flight, and sat down very  hard, at the water's edge. Already the canoe was six feet from shore;  and both men were doing creditable acrobatic stunts to keep it from  turning turtle.    \"Stand perfec'ly still,\" one of them exhorted the damsel, as he saw  with horror that she had been left ashore in the tumbling flight.  \"Stand still and don't holler! Keep your hands high. It's likely he  won't bother you. These highbred collies are pretty gentle with women;  but some of 'em are blue murder to strange men. He--\"    The man swayed for balance. His fellow-hero had brought the canoe  about, in an effort to smite with uplifted paddle at the oncoming dog  without venturing too close to the danger-line.    In the same moment, Lad had gained the brink of the lake. Ignoring the  panic-struck woman on the bank, he flashed past her and galloped,  body-deep, into the water; toward the swaying canoe.    Here he paused. For Lad was anything but a fool. And, like other wise  collies, he had sense enough to realize that a swimming dog is one of  the most helpless creatures in the universe; when it comes to  self-defense.    Ashore, or in water shallow enough to maneuver his powerful body, Lad  could give excellent account of himself against any normal foe. But,  beyond his depth, he would fall easy victim to the first well-aimed  paddle-stroke. And he knew it. Thus, hesitant, his snarling teeth not  two yards from the canoe, he stood growling in futile indignation at  the cranky craft's crankier occupants.    The girl who remained on shore plucked up enough panic-courage to catch  her gaudy pink parasol by the ferule and to swing its heavy handle with  all her fear-driven strength at Lad's skull. Luckily, the aim was as  bad as it was vehement. The handle grazed the dog's shoulder, then  struck the lake with a force that snapped the flimsy parasol in two.  Whereat the girl shrieked aloud; and scuttled back as Lad spun around  to face her.    But she might as well have spared herself the scream. She was in no  danger. True, the collie had whirled to seek and resent this new source  of attack. But, seeing only a yelling and retreating woman behind him,  he contented himself with a menacing growl, and turned again toward the  canoe.    One of the men, poising himself, had swung aloft his paddle. Now, with  full strength, he  brought down the edged blade at the dog's head.    But it is one thing to aim a blow, from a tilting canoe; and quite  another to make that blow land in the spot aimed for.    The whizzing paddle-blade missed Lad, clean. Not only because the dog  veered sharply aside as it descended, but because the canoe, under the  jarring heave of the striker's body, proceeded to turn turtle.    Into the water plopped the two men. Into the water, with them, splashed  their rescued companion. This gentle soul had not ceased screaming,  from the time she was hauled aboard. But now, submergence cut short her  cries. A second later, the lamentations recommenced; in higher if more  liquid volume. For, the shore, at the point sloped very gradually out  to deeper water. And immediately, she and the two men had regained  their foothold.    There, chest deep the trio stood or staggered. And, there, between them  and the beach, raged Lad. None of the three cared to risk wading  shoreward, with such an obstacle between themselves and land. The girl  on the bank added her quota of squalls to those of her semi-engulfed  friend; and one of the men began to reach far under water for a rock to  throw at the guard dog.    The first shrill cry had reached the Master, as he sat at work in his  study. Down the slope he came running; and stopped in slack-jawed amaze  at the tableau in front of him.    On the bank hopped and wriggled a woman in vivid garments,--a woman who  waved a broken parasol and seemed to be practicing an Indian war-howl.  Elbow deep in the placid waters of the lake floundered another woman  almost as wonderfully attired as the first, and quite as vocal. On  either side of her was a drenched and gesticulating man. In the  background bobbed an upset canoe. Between the two disrupted factions of  the happy picnic party stood Lad.    The collie had ceased to growl; and, with head on one side, was looking  in eager inquiry at the Master. Lad had carried this watchdog exploit  to a point where the next move was hard to figure out. He was glad the  Master had arrived, to take charge of the situation. It seemed to call  for human, rather than canine, solution. And Lad was profoundly  interested as to the sequel. All of which showed as clearly in the  collie's whimsically expressive face as ever it could have been set  forth in print.    Both men began to talk at once; with lurid earnestness and vast wealth  of gesture. So did the women.    There was no need. The Master, already, had caught sight of the  half-spread lunch on the grass. And it was by no means his first or his  tenth experience with trespassers. He understood. Snapping his fingers,  to summon Lad to his side, he patted the dog's silken head; and strove  not to laugh.    \"And just as we was sitting down, peaceful, to eat, and not harming no  one at all and minding our own business,\" came a fragment of one man's  oration, above the clamor of the others, \"that big dark-sable collie of  yours came tearing down on us and--\"    The triple opposition of outcry and complaint blurred the rest of his  enraged whine. But the Master looked out at him in new interest. The  man had used the term, \"dark-sable collie\"; which, by the way, was the  technical phrase for Lad's coloring. Not one non-collie-man in a  thousand would have known the meaning of the term; to say nothing of  using it by instinct. The Master stared curiously at the floundering  and sputtering speaker.    \"Aren't you the manager of the Lochaber Collie Kennels, up at  Beauville?\" he asked, speaking loud enough to be heard above the  subsiding din. \"I think I've seen you at Westminster and at some of the  local shows. Higham is your name, isn't it?\"    \"Yes, it is,\" returned the kennel man, truculent, but surprised almost  into civility. \"And this is my assistant, Mister Rice. And these two  young lady friends of ours are--Say!\" he broke off, furiously,  remembering his plight and swinging back to rage, as he began to wade  shoreward. \"We're going to have the law on you, friend! Your collie  tackled us when we was peaceably-\"    \"When you were peaceably ignoring this trespass sign of mine?\" finished  the Master. \"Don't forget that. If you didn't have these girls with  you, I'd keep "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],[0,"Dead Man's Land (#9)"],[1,"guide, though, who will show you the way far better than  I could.\"    \"Yes, the guide,\" said Mark hastily.  \"That's why we have come up this  morning.\"    \"Well, you couldn't have come at a better time,\" said the officer.  \"He  has been far away, for some reason best known to himself, but he marched  into camp last evening, looking as if he were monarch of all he  surveyed.\"    \"Then that's the man we saw!\" cried Dean excitedly.    \"Tall, black, fine-looking fellow, well built, and a savage chief every  inch of him?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mark eagerly; \"and hardly any clothes.\"    \"That's the man.  There, I will send one of my men to fetch him here;\"  and stepping to the window he called to the sentry on duty to pass the  word for someone to hunt out Mak and bring him there.    \"Mak!\" said the doctor, laughing.  \"What, have you got Scotch blacks  here?\"    \"Oh, no.  We call him Mak because he is like one of the Makalaka.  Properly he belongs to a great tribe called the Ulakas, who used at one  time to occupy the kopjes about here.  I suppose that is why this place  has come to be known as Illakaree.\"    Only a few minutes later the tall, stately-looking black of the  preceding evening was seen crossing the barrack enclosure, carrying his  spear over his shoulder and looking down with a sort of contempt at the  young bugler by his side, to which the boy retorted by looking up as  contemptuously at the stalwart black, thinking of him as a naked nigger.    \"Now I don't wish to interfere,\" said the captain.  \"I only want to be  of service to you gentlemen out in this wild place, if I can.  It is no  presumption to say, I suppose, that you can't understand the Illaka  dialect?\"    \"Certainly not,\" said the doctor.  \"I daresay I could get on if the man  addressed me in ancient Greek.\"    \"Which he will not do,\" said the captain, laughing.  \"He will say very  little, and what he does say will consist of the most curious jumble of  English that ever man gave utterance to.  So will you trust me to make  terms with him as to what he is to do and what he is to be paid?  I  purpose offering him the same terms as were given to him by his last  employers.  He wants very little--and no current coin.  A good knife or  two and some brass rings will satisfy him.  And as to his work that he  is to do for you, I tell you frankly that he will not do a stroke, but  he will tramp with you upon hunting expeditions till he will tire you  out; he will be as keen-scented as a dog, a splendid tracker of every  kind of wild beast, and if needs be he will fight for you bravely to the  death.\"    \"Well, you couldn't give him a better character,\" said the doctor, \"for  our purpose.  But what bad qualities have you to put against this?\"    \"Oh, he is a very wolf at eating.\"    \"Well, it's only fair that he should be,\" said Mark, \"if he hunts for  and finds the meat.\"    \"I quite agree with you,\" said the captain.  \"Then let me see; I did  tell you that he won't do a stroke of work.  He is too great a swell--  for he really is a chief, and was beaten by a stronger party and had to  retreat for his life.\"    \"But I say,\" said Mark, \"how are we going to get on with him if he is  going to carry on in that stuck-up, haughty way?\"    \"Oh, that's nothing,\" said the captain, laughing.  \"He puts that on when  he comes into camp, to show his contempt for my men.  A few of the larky  spirits teased him a bit some time ago, and he wouldn't stand it.  But I  have seen a good deal of him, and he likes me because I wigged the men  and gave them to understand before him that I would have none of that  nonsense.  Why, when he is away out in the forest or veldt with a  hunting party--and people treat him well--he is like a merry boy, a  regular child of nature.  But treat him with contempt, and it raises his  bile directly.  We are too fond of treating these natives as niggers,  but some of them are fine fellows, and as brave as lions--Pooh!  Nonsense!  As brave as men can be.  Yes,\" he continued, as an orderly  appeared, \"send in Mak.\"    The fine-looking black stepped in, to stand in dignified silence,  looking keenly round at the party, while the captain spoke to him in  broken English which sounded somewhat like that of a weak old nurse  prattling to a child, and in answer to which the black responded with  the single word, \"Good.\"    \"There,\" said the captain, \"I have explained everything to him,  gentlemen, and his word `Good' means that he will serve you faithfully,  and show you plenty of game, to find which he will take you to the  mineral forest where the trees are so high that it is nearly always  twilight, and after that guide you on to the great city where the old  people lived, and show you the mighty stones with which they built.  That's all, gentlemen.  Metaphorically signed and sealed and witnessed  by your humble servant, Frank Lawton, of Her Majesty's 200th Light  Infantry.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the doctor.  \"I never knew there was so much in the  one word good before.\"    Mark glanced at the black, who had been listening intently to the  doctor, and catching the boy's movement he fixed him with his eyes so  that they two were for some moments apparently trying to read each  other's thoughts.    \"Well, you look all right,\" said the boy to himself, and his frank, open  countenance expanded into a pleasant smile.    At this the haughty face before him changed suddenly, as if so much  natural sunshine had flashed out, and stepping up to the boy he turned  his spear upside down so that the point of the keen, leaf-like blade  rested on the plain boarded floor of the captain's room, and bending  forward he laid the back of his right hand upon Mark's breast.    \"Baas,\" he said, in a deep musical voice; and then moving slowly and  with dignity he passed round to each, to repeat the action and the word,  his eyes beaming upon everyone in turn, and then finishing off by  uttering once more the one word, \"Good.\"    He then glanced at the captain and asked him some question, to which the  captain nodded.    The next minute he had glided bare-footed and silent out of the room,  while as the party watched they saw him march haughtily past the window  and away across the barrack yard.    \"There, gentlemen, that's settled, then,\" said the captain.    \"Settled?\" said Sir James.  \"But I ought to give him what the country  people call a fastening penny, ought I not?\"    \"Oh, no, nothing of the kind.\"    \"But about finding him when we want to start?  For I want to get away  from here as soon as possible.\"    \"You will not have to find him,\" said the captain, laughing.  \"He will  find you.  You may see him hanging about, or you may not.  But you may  depend upon one thing, that from henceforth he will be like your shadow.  Oh, but one word,\" the captain added.  \"Your men seem quiet,  respectable fellows, but it might be advisable for you to say a few  words to them about their treatment of your guide.  You know what I  mean--about their looking upon him as a nigger.  I don't think you need  speak to Buck Denham, the big bullock driver, nor to the Hottentot.  There.\"    Sir James and the doctor offered plenty of words of thanks, at which the  captain laughed.    \"My dear sirs,\" he said, \"not a word more.  Put yourselves in my place  and suppose I came up country as you did.  Wouldn't you have been as  pleased as I and our mess are to meet a brother Englishman so far away  from home?  So not a word more but these: If ever I can serve you in any  way, here I am, and you know my name.  There, boys, we will see you off  when you start, and fire a salute, just as if we had had a visit from  the Prince.\"        CHAPTER EIGHT.    MARK'S FIRST WATCH.    \"Now, look here,\" said Sir James, \"we have talked all this matter over  quite enough, and it is high time that we started in a business-like  way, so as to avoid all confusion.\"    \"Hear, hear,\" said the boys together, and Sir James went on.    \"First of all, I am nobody.\"    \"Oh!  Oh, I say, father!\" cried Mark laughing.    \"You hold your tongue, and don't interrupt.  I repeat that I am nobody,  only a visitor who looks on and joins in the sport when I feel so  disposed, and one whom you and your men must take care of.\"    \"But we must have a captain, sir, to give all orders.\"    \"Of course,\" said Sir James.  \"I constitute you captain; you, Mark,  first lieutenant; Dean, second lieutenant.\"    \"But, Sir James--\"    \"Dr Robertson, I have planned all this, and I presume that I have a  right to do as I please.\"    \"Certainly, sir,\" said the doctor.    \"And perhaps I may think it right to interfere when things are going on  not to satisfy me.\"    \"Of course, sir;\" and the boys looked at one another.    \"Well,\" continued Sir James, \"we have arrived at this pitch, that we are  quite independent of the inn.  I have paid everybody, and for the last  two nights we have been practising camping out, and are going to sleep  again to-night in our waggons as we intend to do during our campaign.  You, Robertson, have reported to me that everything is properly packed,  the waggons loaded with our stores.  You have trained our men to occupy  their places; we make this waggon our tent or fort to sleep in or sleep  under, according to the weather; in short, there is nothing to prevent  our starting to-morrow morning.\"    \"So soon, father?\" said Mark.    \"So soon, sir!  Yes.  Haven't we been busy here for a fortnight, making  our preparations?  And a very busy time it has been.  I consider that we  have finished our stay here with bidding good-bye to the officers and  thanking them.  You saw how I stopped back at the barracks this evening.  Do you know what it was for, doctor?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"To tell Captain Lawton that I would rather not have any nonsense and  procession or firing of farewell salute, and that I had made up my mind  that we would start early to-morrow morning.\"    \"Then we really are to go to-morrow, father?\"    \"Of"]]]
