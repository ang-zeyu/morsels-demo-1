I bow myself to Thee,    Namostu Te, Devavara! Prasid![FN#23]    O Mightiest Lord! rehearse    Why hast Thou face so fierce?    Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed?      Krishna.    Thou seest Me as Time who kills,    Time who brings all to doom,    The Slayer Time, Ancient of Days, come hither to consume;    Excepting thee, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed,    There stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! Dismayed    No longer be! Arise! obtain renown! destroy thy foes!    Fight for the kingdom waiting thee when thou hast vanquished those.    By Me they fall--not thee! the stroke of death is dealt them now,    Even as they show thus gallantly; My instrument art thou!    Strike, strong-armed Prince, at Drona! at Bhishma strike! deal death    On Karna, Jyadratha; stay all their warlike breath!    'Tis I who bid them perish! Thou wilt but slay the slain;    Fight! they must fall, and thou must live, victor upon this plain!      Sanjaya.    Hearing mighty Keshav's word,    Tremblingly that helmed Lord    Clasped his lifted palms, and--praying    Grace of Krishna--stood there, saying,    With bowed brow and accents broken,    These words, timorously spoken:      Arjuna.    Worthily, Lord of Might!    The whole world hath delight    In Thy surpassing power, obeying Thee;    The Rakshasas, in dread    At sight of Thee, are sped    To all four quarters; and the company      Of Siddhas sound Thy name.    How should they not proclaim    Thy Majesties, Divinest, Mightiest?    Thou Brahm, than Brahma greater!    Thou Infinite Creator!    Thou God of gods, Life's Dwelling-place and Rest!      Thou, of all souls the Soul!    The Comprehending Whole!    Of being formed, and formless being the Framer;    O Utmost One! O Lord!    Older than eld, Who stored    The worlds with wealth of life! O Treasure-Claimer,      Who wottest all, and art    Wisdom Thyself! O Part    In all, and All; for all from Thee have risen    Numberless now I see    The aspects are of Thee!    Vayu[FN#24] Thou art, and He who keeps the prison      Of Narak, Yama dark;    And Agni's shining spark;    Varuna's waves are Thy waves. Moon and starlight    Are Thine! Prajapati    Art Thou, and 'tis to Thee    They knelt in worshipping the old world's far light,      The first of mortal men.    Again, Thou God! again    A thousand thousand times be magnified!    Honour and worship be--    Glory and praise,--to Thee    Namo, Namaste, cried on every side;      Cried here, above, below,    Uttered when Thou dost go,    Uttered where Thou dost come! Namo! we call;    Namostu! God adored!    Namostu! Nameless Lord!    Hail to Thee! Praise to Thee! Thou One in all;      For Thou art All! Yea, Thou!    Ah! if in anger now    Thou shouldst remember I did think Thee Friend,    Speaking with easy speech,    As men use each to each;    Did call Thee \"Krishna,\" \"Prince,\" nor comprehend      Thy hidden majesty,    The might, the awe of Thee;    Did, in my heedlessness, or in my love,    On journey, or in jest,    Or when we lay at rest,    Sitting at council, straying in the grove,      Alone, or in the throng,    Do Thee, most Holy! wrong,    Be Thy grace granted for that witless sin!    For Thou art, now I know,    Father of all below,    Of all above, of all the worlds within      Guru of Gurus; more    To reverence and adore    Than all which is adorable and high!    How, in the wide worlds three    Should any equal be?    Should any other share Thy Majesty?      Therefore, with body bent    And reverent intent,    I praise, and serve, and seek Thee, asking grace.    As father to a son,    As friend to friend, as one    Who loveth to his lover, turn Thy face      In gentleness on me!    Good is it I did see    This unknown marvel of Thy Form! But fear    Mingles with joy! Retake,    Dear Lord! for pity's sake    Thine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear!      Be merciful, and show    The visage that I know;    Let me regard Thee, as of yore, arrayed    With disc and forehead-gem,    With mace and anadem,    Thou that sustainest all things! Undismayed      Let me once more behold    The form I loved of old,    Thou of the thousand arms and countless eyes!    This frightened heart is fain    To see restored again    My Charioteer, in Krishna's kind disguise.      Krishna.    Yea! thou hast seen, Arjuna! because I loved thee well,    The secret countenance of Me, revealed by mystic spell,    Shining, and wonderful, and vast, majestic, manifold,    Which none save thou in all the years had favour to behold;    For not by Vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms,    Nor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers, nor chaunted    psalms,    That mortal eyes should bear to view the Immortal Soul unclad,    Prince of the Kurus! This was kept for thee alone! Be glad!    Let no more trouble shake thy heart, because thine eyes have seen    My terror with My glory. As I before have been    So will I be again for thee; with lightened heart behold!    Once more I am thy Krishna, the form thou knew'st of old!      Sanjaya.    These words to Arjuna spake    Vasudev, and straight did take    Back again the semblance dear    Of the well-loved charioteer;    Peace and joy it did restore    When the Prince beheld once more    Mighty BRAHMA's form and face    Clothed in Krishna's gentle grace.      Arjuna.    Now that I see come back, Janardana!    This friendly human frame, my mind can think    Calm thoughts once more; my heart beats still again!      Krishna.    Yea! it was wonderful and terrible    To view me as thou didst, dear Prince! The gods    Dread and desire continually to view!    Yet not by Vedas, nor from sacrifice,    Nor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer    Shall any so behold, as thou hast seen!    Only by fullest service, perfect faith,    And uttermost surrender am I known    And seen, and entered into, Indian Prince!    Who doeth all for Me; who findeth Me    In all; adoreth always; loveth all    Which I have made, and Me, for Love's sole end    That man, Arjuna! unto Me doth wend.      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XI. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Viswarupadarsanam,\"    Or \"The Book of the Manifesting of the One and Manifold.\"            CHAPTER XII        Arjuna.    Lord! of the men who serve Thee--true in heart--    As God revealed; and of the men who serve,    Worshipping Thee Unrevealed, Unbodied, Far,    Which take the better way of faith and life?      Krishna.    Whoever serve Me--as I show Myself--    Constantly true, in full devotion fixed,    Those hold I very holy. But who serve--    Worshipping Me The One, The Invisible,    The Unrevealed, Unnamed, Unthinkable,    Uttermost, All-pervading, Highest, Sure--    Who thus adore Me, mastering their sense,    Of one set mind to all, glad in all good,    These blessed souls come unto Me.      Yet, hard    The travail is for such as bend their minds    To reach th' Unmanifest That viewless path    Shall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh!    But whereso any doeth all his deeds    Renouncing self for Me, full of Me, fixed    To serve only the Highest, night and day    Musing on Me--him will I swiftly lift    Forth from life's ocean of distress and death,    Whose soul clings fast to Me. Cling thou to Me!    Clasp Me with heart and mind! so shalt thou dwell    Surely with Me on high. But if thy thought    Droops from such height; if thou be'st weak to set    Body and soul upon Me constantly,    Despair not! give Me lower service! seek    To reach Me, worshipping with steadfast will;    And, if thou canst not worship steadfastly,    Work for Me, toil in works pleasing to Me!    For he that laboureth right for love of Me    Shall finally attain! But, if in this    Thy faint heart fails, bring Me thy failure! find    Refuge in Me! let fruits of labour go,    Renouncing hope for Me, with lowliest heart,    So shalt thou come; for, though to know is more    Than diligence, yet worship better is    Than knowing, and renouncing better still.    Near to renunciation--very near--    Dwelleth Eternal Peace!      Who hateth nought    Of all which lives, living himself benign,    Compassionate, from arrogance exempt,    Exempt from love of self, unchangeable    By good or ill; patient, contented, firm    In faith, mastering himself, true to his word,    Seeking Me, heart and soul; vowed unto Me,--    That man I love! Who troubleth not his kind,    And is not troubled by them; clear of wrath,    Living too high for gladness, grief, or fear,    That man I love! Who, dwelling quiet-eyed,[FN#25]    Stainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed,    Working with Me, yet from all works detached,    That man I love! Who, fixed in faith on Me,    Dotes upon none, scorns none; rejoices not,    And grieves not, letting good or evil hap    Light when it will, and when it will depart,    That man I love! Who, unto friend and foe    Keeping an equal heart, with equal mind    Bears shame and glory; with an equal peace    Takes heat and cold, pleasure and pain; abides    Quit of desires, hears praise or calumny    In passionless restraint, unmoved by each;    Linked by no ties to earth, steadfast in Me,    That man I love! But most of all I love    Those happy ones to whom 'tis life to live    In single fervid faith and love unseeing,    Drinking the blessed Amrit of my Being!      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XII. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Bhaktiyog,\"    Or\"The Book of the Religion of Faith.\"            CHAPTER XIII        Arjuna.    Now would I hear, O gracious Kesava![FN#26]    Of Life which seems, and Soul beyond, which sees,    And what it is we know-or think to know.      Krishna.    Yea! Son of Kunti! for this flesh ye see    Is Kshetra, is the field where Life disports;    And that which views and knows it is the Soul,    Kshetrajna. In all \"fields,\" thou Indian prince!    I am Kshetrajna. I am what surveys!    Only that knowledge knows which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],[0,"Bruce (#9)"],[1,"enough for him to do  it. We look on the trick as tremendously clever. But that's because we  love Bruce. Almost any dog can be taught to do it, I suppose. We--\"    \"You're mistaken!\" corrected the guest. \"Almost any dog CAN'T be taught  to. Some dogs can, of course; but they are the exception. I ought to  know, for I've been where dog-couriers are a decidedly important  feature of trench-warfare. I stopped at one of the dog-training schools  in England, too, on my way back from Picardy, and watched the teaching  of the dogs that are sent to France and Flanders. Not one in ten can be  trained to carry messages; and not one in thirty can be counted on to  do it reliably. You ought to be proud of Bruce.\"    \"We are,\" replied the Mistress. \"He is one of the family. We think  everything of him. He was such a stupid and awkward puppy, too! Then,  in just a few months, he shaped up, as he is now. And his brain woke.\"    Bruce interrupted the talk by reappearing on the veranda. The folded  envelope was still in the ring on his collar. The guest glanced  furtively at the Master, expecting some sign of chagrin at the collie's  failure.    Instead, the Master took the envelope, unfolded it and glanced at a  word or two that had been written beneath his own scrawl; then he made  another penciled addition to the envelope's writing, stuck the twisted  paper back into the ring and said--    \"Roberts.\"    Off trotted Bruce on his second trip.    \"I had forgotten to say which train you'll have to take in the  morning,\" explained the Master. \"So Roberts wrote, asking what time he  was to have the car at the door after breakfast. It was careless of me.\"    The guest did not answer. But when Bruce presently returned,--this time  with no paper in his collar-ring,--the officer passed his hand  appraisingly through the dog's heavy coat and looked keenly down into  his dark eyes.    \"Gun-shy?\" asked the guest. \"Or perhaps he's never heard a gun fired?\"    \"He's heard hundreds of guns fired,\" said the Master. \"I never allow a  gun to be fired on The Place, of course, because we've made it a bird  refuge. But Bruce went with us in the car to the testing of the Lewis  machineguns, up at Haskell. They made a most ungodly racket. But  somehow it didn't seem to bother the Big Dog at all.\"    \"H'm!\" mused the guest, his professional interest vehemently roused.  \"He would be worth a fortune over there. There are a lot of collies in  the service, in one capacity or another--almost as many as the  Airedales and the police dogs. And they are doing grand work. But I  never saw one that was better fitted for it than Bruce. It's a pity he  lives on the wrong side of the Atlantic. He could do his bit, to more  effect than the average human. There are hundreds of thousands of men  for the ranks, but pitifully few perfect courier-dogs.\"    The Mistress was listening with a tensity which momentarily grew more  painful. The Master's forehead, too, was creased with a new thought  that seemed to hurt him. To break the brief silence that followed the  guest's words, he asked:    \"Are the dogs, over there, really doing such great work as the papers  say they are? I read, the other day--\"    \"'Great work!'\" repeated the guest. \"I should say so. Not only in  finding the wounded and acting as guards on listening posts, and all  that, but most of all as couriers. There are plenty of times when the  wireless can't be used for sending messages from one point to another,  and where there is no telephone connection, and where the firing is too  hot for a human courier to get through. That is where is the war dogs  have proved their weight in radium. Collies, mostly. There are a  million true stories of their prowess told, at camp-fires. Here are  just two such incidents--both of them on record, by the way, at the  British War Office    \"A collie, down near Soissons, was sent across a bad strip of  fire-scourged ground, with a message. A boche sharpshooter fired at him  and shattered his jaw. The dog kept on, in horrible agony, and  delivered the message. Another collie was sent over a still hotter and  much longer stretch of territory with a message. (That was during the  Somme drive of 1916.) He was shot at, a dozen times, as he ran. At last  two bullets got him. He fell over, mortally wounded. He scrambled to  his feet and kept on falling, stumbling, staggering--till he got to his  destination. Then he dropped dead at the side of the Colonel the  message had been sent to. And those are only two of thousands of true  collie-anecdotes. Yet some fools are trying to get American dogs done  away with, as 'non-utilitarian,' while the war lasts! As if the dogs in  France, today, weren't earning their overseas brothers' right to  live--and live well!\"    Neither of his hearers made reply when the guest finished his earnest,  eager recital. Neither of them had paid much heed to his final words.  For the Master and the Mistress were looking at each other in mute  unhappiness. The same miserable thought was in the mind of each. And  each knew the thought that was torturing the mind of the other.    Presently, at a glint of inquiry in the Master's eye, the Mistress  suddenly bent over and buried her face in the deep mass of Bruce's ruff  as the dog stood lovingly beside her. Then, still stroking the collie's  silken head, she returned her husband's wretchedly questioning glance  with a resigned little nod. The Master cleared his throat noisily  before he could speak with the calm indifference he sought. Then,  turning to the apparently unnoticing guest, he said--    \"I think I told you I tried to get across to France at the very  start--and I was barred because I am past forty and because I have a  bum heart and several other defects that a soldier isn't supposed to  have. My wife and I have tried to do what little we can for the Cause,  on this side of the ocean. But it has seemed woefully little, when we  remember what others are doing. And we have no son we can send.\"    Again he cleared his throat and went on with sulky ungraciousness:    \"We both know what you've been driving at for the past five minutes.  And--and we agree. Bruce can go.\"    \"Great!\" applauded the guest. \"That's fine! He'll be worth his--\"    \"If you think we're a couple of fools for not doing this more  willingly,\" went on the Master with savage earnestness, \"just stop to  think what it means to a man to give up the dog he loves. Not to give  him up to some one who will assure him a good home, but to send him  over into that hell, where a German bullet or a shell-fragment or  hunger or disease is certain to get him, soon or late. To think of him  lying smashed and helpless, somewhere in No Man's Land, waiting for  death; or caught by the enemy and eaten! (The Red Cross bulletin says  no less than eight thousand dogs were eaten, in Saxony alone, in 1913,  the year BEFORE the war began.) Or else to be captured and then cut up  by some German vivisector-surgeon in the sacred interests of Science!  Oh, we can bring ourselves to send Bruce over there! But don't expect  us to do it with a good grace. For we can't.\"    \"I--\" began the embarrassed guest; but the Mistress chimed in, her  sweet voice not quite steady.    \"You see, Captain, we've made such a pet--such a baby--of Bruce! All  his life he has lived here--here where he had the woods to wander in  and the lake to swim in, and this house for his home. He will be so  unhappy and--Well, don't let's talk about that! When I think of the  people who give their sons and everything they have, to the country, I  feel ashamed of not being more willing to let a mere dog go. But then  Bruce is not just a 'mere dog.' He is--he is BRUCE. All I ask is that  if he is injured and not killed, you'll arrange to have him sent back  here to us. We'll pay for it, of course. And will you write to whomever  you happen to know, at that dog-training school in England, and ask  that Bruce be treated nicely while he is training there? He's never  been whipped. He's never needed it, you see.\"      The Mistress might have spared herself much worry as to Bruce's  treatment in the training school to which he was consigned. It was not  a place of cruelty, but of development. And when, out of the thousands  of dogs sent there, the corps of trainers found one with promise of  strong ability, such a pupil was handled with all the care and  gentleness and skill that a temperamental prima donna might expect.    Such a dog was the big American collie, debarked from a goods car at  the training camp railway station, six weeks after the Mistress and the  Master had consented to his enlistment. And the handlers treated him  accordingly.    The Master himself had taken Bruce to the transport, in Brooklyn, and  had led him aboard the overfull ship. The new sights and sounds around  him interested the home-bred collie. But when the Master turned him  over to the officer in whose charge he was to be for the voyage,  Bruce's deep-set eyes clouded with a sudden heartsick foreboding.    Wrenching himself free from the friendly hand on his collar, he sprang  in pursuit of his departing deity,--the loved Master who was leaving  him alone and desolate among all these strange scenes and noises. The  Master, plodding, sullen and heavy-hearted, toward the gangway, was  aware of a cold nose thrust into his dejected hand.    Looking down he beheld Bruce staring up at him with a world of stark  appeal in his troubled gaze. The Master swallowed hard; then laid his  hand on the beautiful head pressed so confidingly against his knee.  Turning, he led the dog back to the quarters assigned to him.    \"Stay here, old friend!\" he commanded, huskily. \"It's all right. You'll  make good. I know that. And there's a chance in a billion that you'll  come back to us. I'm--I'm not deserting you. And I guess there's  precious little danger that any one on The Place will ever forget you.  It's--it's all right."]]]
