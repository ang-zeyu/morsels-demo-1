On such  occasions they seem to be coming together for some aerial festival or  grand celebration; and, as if bent upon a final effort to work off a  part of their superabundant wing-power before settling down for the  night, they circle and circle high above the chimney-top, a great cloud  of them, drifting this way and that, all in high spirits and chippering  as they fly. Their numbers constantly increase as other members of the  clan come dashing in from all points of the compass. Swifts seem to  materialize out of empty air on all sides of the chippering, whirling  ring, as an hour or more this assembling of the clan and this flight  festival go on. The birds must gather in from whole counties, or from  half a State. They have been on the wing all day, and yet now they seem  as tireless as the wind, and as if unable to curb their powers.    One fall they gathered in this way and took refuge for the night in a  large chimney-stack in a city near me, and kept this course up for more  than a month and a half. Several times I went to town to witness the  spectacle, and a spectacle it was: ten thousand swifts, I should think,  filling the air above a whole square like a whirling swarm of huge black  bees, but saluting the ear with a multitudinous chippering, instead of a  humming. People gathered upon the sidewalks to see them. It was a rare  circus performance, free to all. After a great many feints and playful  approaches, the whirling ring of birds would suddenly grow denser above  the chimney; then a stream of them, as if drawn down by some power of  suction, would pour into the opening. For only a few seconds would this  downward rush continue; then, as if the spirit of frolic had again got  the upper hand of them, the ring would rise, and the chippering and  circling go on. In a minute or two the same man[oe]uvre would be  repeated, the chimney, as it were, taking its swallows at intervals to  prevent choking. It usually took a half-hour or more for the birds all  to disappear down its capacious throat. There was always an air of  timidity and irresolution about their approach to the chimney, just as  there always is about their approach to the dead tree-top from which  they procure their twigs for nest-building. Often did I see birds  hesitate above the opening and then pass on, apparently as though they  had not struck it at just the right angle. On one occasion a solitary  bird was left flying, and it took three or four trials either to make up  its mind or to catch the trick of the descent. On dark or threatening or  stormy days the birds would begin to assemble by mid-afternoon, and by  four or five o'clock were all in their lodgings.          THE OVEN-BIRD      Every loiterer about the woods knows this pretty, speckled-breasted,  olive-backed little bird, which walks along over the dry leaves a few  yards from him, moving its head as it walks, like a miniature domestic  fowl. Most birds are very stiff-necked, like the robin, and as they run  or hop upon the ground, carry the head as if it were riveted to the  body. Not so the oven-bird, or the other birds that walk, as the  cow-bunting, or the quail, or the crow. They move the head forward with  the movement of the feet. The sharp, reiterated, almost screeching song  of the oven-bird, as it perches on a limb a few feet from the ground,  like the words \"preacher, preacher, preacher,\" or \"teacher, teacher,  teacher,\" uttered louder and louder, and repeated six or seven times, is  also familiar to most ears; but its wild, ringing, rapturous burst of  song in the air high above the tree-tops is not so well known. From a  very prosy, tiresome, unmelodious singer, it is suddenly transformed for  a brief moment into a lyric poet of great power. It is a great surprise.  The bird undergoes a complete transformation. Ordinarily it is a very  quiet, demure sort of bird. It walks about over the leaves, moving its  head like a little hen; then perches on a limb a few feet from the  ground and sends forth its shrill, rather prosy, unmusical chant. Surely  it is an ordinary, commonplace bird. But wait till the inspiration of  its flight-song is upon it. What a change! Up it goes through the  branches of the trees, leaping from limb to limb, faster and faster,  till it shoots from the tree-tops fifty or more feet into the air above  them, and bursts into an ecstasy of song, rapid, ringing, lyrical; no  more like its habitual performance than a match is like a rocket; brief  but thrilling; emphatic but musical. Having reached its climax of flight  and song, the bird closes its wings and drops nearly perpendicularly  downward like the skylark. If its song were more prolonged, it would  rival the song of that famous bird. The bird does this many times a day  during early June, but oftenest at twilight.    About the first of June there is a nest in the woods, upon the ground,  with four creamy-white eggs in it, spotted with brown or lilac, chiefly  about the larger ends, that always gives the walker who is so lucky as  to find it a thrill of pleasure. It is like a ground sparrow's nest with  a roof or canopy to it. The little brown or olive backed bird starts  away from your feet and runs swiftly and almost silently over the dry  leaves, and then turns her speckled breast to see if you are following.  She walks very prettily, by far the prettiest pedestrian in the woods.  But if she thinks you have discovered her secret, she feigns lameness  and disability of both leg and wing, to decoy you into the pursuit of  her. This is the oven-bird. The last nest of this bird I found was while  in quest of the pink cypripedium. We suddenly spied a couple of the  flowers a few steps from the path along which we were walking, and had  stooped to admire them, when out sprang the bird from beside them,  doubtless thinking she was the subject of observation instead of the  rose-purple flowers that swung but a foot or two above her. But we never  should have seen her had she kept her place. She had found a rent in the  matted carpet of dry leaves and pine needles that covered the ground,  and into this had insinuated her nest, the leaves and needles forming a  canopy above it, sloping to the south and west, the source of the more  frequent summer rains.          THE CATBIRD      It requires an effort for me to speak of the singing catbird as he; all  the ways and tones of the bird seem so distinctly feminine. But it is,  of course, only the male that sings. At times I hardly know whether I am  more pleased or annoyed with him. Perhaps he is a little too common, and  his part in the general chorus a little too conspicuous. If you are  listening for the note of another bird, he is sure to be prompted to the  most loud and protracted singing, drowning all other sounds; if you sit  quietly down to observe a favorite or study a new-comer, his curiosity  knows no bounds, and you are scanned and ridiculed from every point of  observation. Yet I would not miss him; I would only subordinate him a  little, make him less conspicuous.    He is the parodist of the woods, and there is ever a mischievous,  bantering, half-ironical undertone in his lay, as if he were conscious  of mimicking and disconcerting some envied songster. Ambitious of song,  practicing and rehearsing in private, he yet seems the least sincere and  genuine of the sylvan minstrels, as if he had taken up music only to be  in the fashion, or not to be outdone by the robins and thrushes. In  other words, he seems to sing from some outward motive, and not from  inward joyousness. He is a good versifier, but not a great poet.  Vigorous, rapid, copious, not without fine touches, but destitute of any  high, serene melody, his performance, like that of Thoreau's squirrel,  always implies a spectator.    There is a certain air and polish about his strain, however, like that  in the vivacious conversation of a well-bred lady of the world, that  commands respect. His parental instinct, also, is very strong, and that  simple structure of dead twigs and dry grass is the centre of much  anxious solicitude. Not long since, while strolling through the woods,  my attention was attracted to a small densely-grown swamp, hedged in  with eglantine, brambles, and the everlasting smilax, from which  proceeded loud cries of distress and alarm, indicating that some  terrible calamity was threatening my sombre-colored minstrel. On  effecting an entrance, which, however, was not accomplished till I had  doffed coat and hat, so as to diminish the surface exposed to the thorns  and brambles, and, looking around me from a square yard of terra firma,  I found myself the spectator of a loathsome yet fascinating scene. Three  or four yards from me was the nest, beneath which, in long festoons,  rested a huge black snake; a bird two-thirds grown was slowly  disappearing between his expanded jaws. As he seemed unconscious of my  presence, I quietly observed the proceedings. By slow degrees he  compassed the bird about with his elastic mouth; his head flattened, his  neck writhed and swelled, and two or three undulatory movements of his  glistening body finished the work. Then he cautiously raised himself up,  his tongue flaming from his mouth the while, curved over the nest, and,  with wavy, subtle motions, explored the interior. I can conceive of  nothing more overpoweringly terrible to an unsuspecting family of birds  than the sudden appearance above their domicile of the head and neck of  this arch-enemy. It is enough to petrify the blood in their veins. Not  finding the object of his search, he came streaming down from the nest  to a lower limb, and commenced extending his researches in other  directions, sliding stealthily through the branches, bent on capturing  one of the parent birds.

Here one would have to hew steps up  and over a pinnacle, there one must descend again and cut around a great  slab. Our wisest course was to seek to reach the crest of the ridge much  further along, beyond as much of this ice chaos as possible. But it was  three days before we could find a way of approach to the crest that did  not take us under overhanging icebergs that threatened continually to  fall upon our heads, as the overhanging hill threatened Christian in the  \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" At last we took straight up a steep gully, half of  it snow slope, the upper half ice-incrusted rock, and hewed steps all  the five hundred feet to the top. Here we were about half a mile beyond  the point at which we first attained the crest, with that half mile of  ice-blocks cut out, but beyond us the prospect loomed just as difficult  and as dangerous. We could cut out no more of the ridge; we had tried  place after place and could reach it safely at no point further along.  The snow slopes broke off with the same sharp cleavage the whole ridge  displayed two thousand five hundred feet above; there was no other  approach.    [Sidenote: The Shattered Ridge]    So our task lay plain and onerous, enormously more dangerous and  laborious than that which our predecessors encountered. We must cut  steps in those ice-blocks, over them, around them, on the sheer sides of  them, under them--whatever seemed to our judgment the best way of  circumventing each individual block. Every ten yards presented a  separate problem. Here was a sharp black rock standing up in a setting  of ice as thin and narrow and steep as the claws that hold the stone in  a finger-ring. That ice must be chopped down level, and then steps cut  all round the rock. It took a solid hour to pass that rock. Here was a  great bluff of ice, with snow so loose and at such a sharp angle about  it that passage had to be hewed up and over and down it again. On either  side the ridge fell precipitously to a glacier floor, with yawning  crevasses half-way down eagerly swallowing every particle of ice and  snow that our axes dislodged: on the right hand to the west fork of the  Muldrow Glacier, by which we had journeyed hither; on the left to the  east fork of the same, perhaps one thousand five hundred feet, perhaps  two thousand feet lower. At the gap in the ridge, with the ice gable on  the other side of it, the difficulty and the danger were perhaps at  their greatest. It took the best part of a day's cutting to make steps  down the slope and then straight up the face of the enormous ice mass  that confronted us. The steps had to be made deep and wide; it was not  merely one passage we were making; these steps would be traversed again  and again by men with heavy packs as we relayed our food and camp  equipage along this ridge, and we were determined from the first to take  no unnecessary risks whatever. We realized that the passage of this  shattered ridge was an exceedingly risky thing at best. To go along it  day after day seemed like tempting Providence. We were resolved that  nothing on our part should be lacking that could contribute to safety.  Day by day we advanced a little further and returned to camp.    [Illustration: The shattered Northeast Ridge.]    [Sidenote: The Hall of the Mountain King]    The weather doubled the time and the tedium of the passage of this  ridge. From Whitsunday to Trinity Sunday, inclusive, there were only two  days that we could make progress on the ridge at all, and on one of  those days the clouds from the coast poured over so densely and  enveloped us so completely that it was impossible to see far enough  ahead to lay out a course wisely. On that day we toppled over into the  abyss a mass of ice, as big as a two-story house, that must have weighed  hundreds of tons. It was poised upon two points of another ice mass and  held upright by a flying buttress of wind-hardened snow. Three or four  blows from Karstens's axe sent it hurling downward. It passed out of our  view into the cloud-smother immediately, but we heard it bound and  rebound until it burst with a report like a cannon, and some days later  we saw its fragments strewn all over the flat two thousand feet below.  What a sight it must have been last July, when the whole ridge was  heaving, shattering, and showering down its bergs upon the glacier  floors! One day we were driven off the ridge by a high wind that  threatened to sweep us from our footholds. On another, a fine morning  gave place to a sudden dense snow-storm that sent us quickly below  again. Always all day long, while we were on that ridge, the distant  thunder of avalanches resounded from the great basin far above us, into  which the two summits of Denali were continually discharging their  snows. It sounded as though the King of Denmark were drinking healths  all day long to the salvoes of his artillery--that custom \"more honored  in the breach than in the observance.\" From such fancy the mind passed  easily enough to the memory of that astonishing composition of Grieg's,  \"In the Hall of the Mountain King,\" and, once recalled, the stately yet  staccato rhythm ran in one's ears continually. For if we had many days  of cloud and smother of vapor that blotted out everything, when a fine  day came how brilliant beyond all that lower levels know it was! From  our perch on that ridge the lofty peaks and massive ridges rose on every  side. As little by little we gained higher and higher eminence the view  broadened, and ever new peaks and ridges thrust themselves into view. We  were within the hall of the mountain kings indeed; kings nameless here,  in this multitude of lofty summits, but that elsewhere in the world  would have each one his name and story.    And how eager and impatient we were to rise high enough, to progress far  enough on that ridge that we might gaze into the great basin itself from  which the thunderings came, the spacious hall of the two lords paramount  of all the mountains of the continent--the north and south peaks of  Denali! Our hearts beat high with the anticipation not only of gazing  upon it but of entering it and pitching our tent in the midst of its  august solitudes. To come down again--for there was as yet no spot  reached on that splintered backbone where we might make a camp--to pass  day after day in our tent on the glacier floor waiting for the bad  weather to be done that we might essay it again; to watch the  tantalizing and, as it seemed, meaningless fluctuations of the barometer  for encouragement; to listen to the driving wind and the swirling snow,  how tedious that was!    [Sidenote: Camp on the Ridge]    At last when we had been camped for three weeks at the head of the  glacier, losing scarce an hour of usable weather, but losing by far the  greater part of the time, when the advance party the day before had  reached a tiny flat on the ridge where they thought camp could be made,  we took a sudden desperate resolve to move to the ridge at any cost. All  the camp contained that would be needed above was made up quickly into  four packs, and we struck out, staggering under our loads. Before we  reached the first slope of the ridge each man knew in his heart that we  were attempting altogether too much. Even Karstens, who had packed his  \"hundred and a quarter\" day after day over the Chilkoot Pass in 1897,  admitted that he was \"heavy.\" But we were saved the chagrin of  acknowledging that we had undertaken more than we could accomplish, for  before we reached the steep slope of the ridge a furious snow-storm had  descended upon us and we were compelled to return to camp. The next day  we proceeded more wisely. We took up half the stuff and dug out a  camping-place and pitched the little tent. Every step had to be  shovelled out, for the previous day's snow had filled it, as had  happened so many times before, and it took five and one-half hours to  reach the new camping-place. On Sunday, 25th May, the first Sunday after  Trinity, we took up the rest of the stuff, and established ourselves at  a new climbing base, about thirteen thousand feet high and one thousand  five hundred feet above the glacier floor, not to descend again until we  descended for good.    We were now much nearer our work and it progressed much faster, although  as the ridge rose it became steeper and steeper and even more rugged and  chaotic, and the difficulty and danger of its passage increased. Our  situation up here was decidedly pleasanter than below. We had indeed  exchanged our large tent for a small one in which we could sit upright  but could not stand, and so narrow that the four of us, lying side by  side, had to make mutual agreement to turn over; our comfortable  wood-stove for the little kerosene stove; yet when the clouds cleared we  had a noble, wide prospect and there was not the sense of damp  immurement that the floor of the glacier gave. The sun struck our tent  at 4.30 A. M., which is nearly two and one-half hours earlier than we  received his rays below, and lingered with us long after our glacier  camp was in the shadow of the North Peak. Moreover, instead of being  colder, as we expected, it was warmer, the minimum ranging around zero  instead of around 10 deg. below.    [Illustration: Camp at 13,000 feet on Northeast Ridge.]    [Sidenote: Clouds and Climate]    The rapidity with which the weather changed up here was a continual  source of surprise to us. At one moment the skies would be clear, the  peaks and the ridge standing out with brilliant definition; literally  five minutes later they would be all blotted out by dense volumes of  vapor that poured over from the south. Perhaps ten minutes more and the  cloud had swept down upon the glacier and all above would be clear  again; or it might be the vapor deepened and thickened into a heavy  snow-storm. Sometimes"]]]
