Whereabouts is it?\"    \"Exactly what we want to know. It is a very old dilapidated house, by  the side of a little stream that runs into the Thames somewhere by Old  Chelsea. I think you must have heard of it. It was once inhabited by the  famous Nell Gwynne.\" I might almost as well have talked Hebrew to our  neighbor, who seemed born to lay in wait for market-carts, and pounce  upon them for toll.    [Illustration: SANDFORD MANOR HOUSE.]    \"Old house! Nell Gwynne!\" he again repeated, and something like an  expression of life and interest moved his features while he added--\"It's  the Nell Gwynne public-house you're after, I'm thinking; that was in  Chelsea; but whether it's there now or not, is more than I can tell.\"    \"No, no,\" we answered, perhaps, sharply, \"it is the house she lived in  we want to see--Sandford Manor House.\"    \"Perhaps it's the madhouse,\" he suggested. We walked on. \"Please,\" said  a little rosy-faced boy, \"if you want to find out any thing about old  houses, Hill, the rat-catcher, knows them all, as he hunts up the rats  and sparrows about; and you have only to go down Thistle Grove, into the  Fulham road--straight on. His is a low house, ma'am--his name in the  window--you can't pass it, for the birds and white mice.\"    And is there no one left, we thought, to tell where the witty,  light-hearted, true-hearted Nelly lived--she who was the friend of  Dryden and Lee, the favorite of Lord Buckhurst, the rival of the Duchess  of Cleveland, the protector of the soldiers of England--the one  unselfish friend of the selfish Charles? Is there no one in a district  that once echoed with the praise of her charities--no one to tell where  she resided, but Hill, the old rat-catcher? We proceeded through the  prettily-built, but gangrened-looking, cottages located in Thistle  Grove, once called Brompton Heath, (or Marsh, we forget which,) until  the sounds of traffic reminded us that we were in the Fulham road.  Presently the sharp voice of a starling, just above us, attracted our  attention.    \"Poor Tom!\" said the bird--\"Tom!--poor Tom!\"    The old rat-catcher invited us to enter. He is a man of powerful frame,  with a massive head, fringed round with an abundance of gray hair, with  deep well-set eyes, and a quiet smile. Two sharp, bitter-looking,  wiry-haired terriers began smelling, casting their sly eyes upwards, to  see if we feared them or were friendly to their advances, and, after a  moment or two, seemed sufficiently satisfied with the scrutiny to  warrant their wagging their short stumpy tails in rude welcome. The room  was hung round with cages of the songbirds of England--some content with  their captivity, others restless, and passing to and fro in front of the  wires, eager for escape. Strong inclosures, containing both rats and  ferrets, were ranged along the sides of the small room; the latter,  long, yellow, pink-eyed, and pink-nosed creatures, lithe as a willow  wand, courting notice; while the rats, on the contrary, moved their  whiskers in defiance, and, with bright, black, determined eyes, sat  lumped up in the distant corners of their dens, ready 'to die game,' if  die they must. Gay-colored finches, the gold and the green, graced the  window in little brown bob cages; while mice of all colors, from the  burnt sienna-colored dormouse, who was more than half asleep within the  skin of an apple which it had scooped out, to the matronly white mouse,  who was sitting composedly amid a progeny of thirteen young ones,  attracted groups of little gazers, every now and then dispersed by the  larger terrier, who ran out amongst them, snarling and threatening, but  doing them no harm. \"Come in, old chap; that will do, old fellow,\" said  his master, adding, \"I would not keep a dog that would hurt any thing  but a _varmint_.\"    \"Oh, oh! Nell's old house,\" he replied to our inquiries; \"Nell Gwynne's  house at Sandy End, where runs the little river they deepened into a  canal--the stream I mean that divides Chelsea from Fulham--Sandford  Manor House! Ay, that I do, and I'd match it against any house in the  county for rats!--terrible place--I lost two ferrets there, this time  two years, and one of them was found t'other side of the canal; it must  have been a pleasant place in those days, when the king was making his  private road through the Chelsea fields, and the stream was as clear as  a thrush's eye, and birds of all sorts were so tamed by Madame Ellen,  that they'd come when she'd call them. Ah, a pretty woman might catch a  king, but it's only a kind one that could tame the wild birds of the  air; I know that; I'll show you the way with pleasure.\" \"Poor Tom,\" sung  out the starling. \"Your bird is calling you,\" we observed, after he had  told his wife not to let the jay pick \"the splints\" off his broken leg,  and we were leaving the door. \"It's not me he's calling,\" answered the  old man, with a heavy sigh. \"Now that's a bit of nature, ma'am. A bird,  I'm thinking, remembers longer than a Christian does. Poor Tom's wife is  married again, but the starling still calls for its master. It's hard to  say, what they do or do not know; the bird often wrings my heart; but  for all that, I could not part with him.\" At any other time we would  have asked him the reason, but just then we were thinking more of Nell  Gwynne than of our guide. We walked on, until we came to the \"World's  End.\" \"It is nothing but a common public-house now,\" observed our  companion, who had not spoken again, except to his dog: \"but I remember  when it was more than that; and, moreover, in Nell's time, it was a  place of great resort for noblemen and fine ladies--a royal tea-garden,  they say--filled with the best of good company; they liked the country  and the open air in those days.\" We continued silent, until at last our  guide called \"Stop!\" so suddenly, as to make us start. \"Do you see that  bank just under the arch of the bridge we stand on? The hardest day's  work I ever had was digging an old rat out of that bank. This is Sandy  End; and that house opposite is Sandford Manor House[F].\"    There was nothing in the sight of those green, grim walls to excite any  feeling of romance. Yet positively our heart beat more rapidly than  usual for a minute or two--\"a way it has\" when we are at all interested.  We turned down a lane seamed with ruts, by the side of a paling black  with gas tar. We passed two or three exceedingly old houses, and one in  particular with three windows in front. It was evident that the paling  had been run across the garden, which must have been very extensive.  After waiting a few minutes for permission from the master of the  gas-works, to whom the Manor House belonged, to enter, an elderly man of  respectable appearance opened the gate, and told us he resided there,  and that the servant would show us all over the house. The rat-catcher  commenced poking his stick into the various mounds of earth wherever  there was the appearance of a hole, and his dogs became at once busy and  animated. There was but one of the three walnut trees said to have been  planted by royal hands, remaining, and that stood gnarled, and thick,  and stunted, close to the present entrance--bent it was, like a thing  whose pleasantest days are gone, and which cares not how soon it may be  gathered into the garner. A circular plot of thick green grass was  directly opposite the hall door, and in its centre grew a young golden  holly, some of the turf being cleared away from round its root. This was  encircled by a fair gravel walk, leading to the house, which was entered  through a rustic porch, covered with ivy; very old and rampant it was,  and its deep heavy foliage, so densely green, had a pall-like look, as  it rustled and sighed in the sharp keen air. It was flanked by two  cypress trees, well-shaped and well-grown. Dank ivy and deep cypress  where the living Nell would have twined roses and passion-flowers! You  see the old door-way when under the porch; it is of no particular order,  but massive and pointed,--the hall is like the usual entrance to  old-fashioned country-houses, panelled with oak. The staircase is very  remarkable, as Mr. Fairholt's sketch will show; broad twisted iron rods,  of great thickness, springing from the oak square pillars which flank  the turnings, and assisting to support the flight above. The room on the  right is large, the ceiling low, the windows deep set in the thick  walls. A very gentle looking little maid was nursing a pretty white cat  by the fire; her young fresh face and bright smile were like sunbeams in  a tomb; what did she there? We could fancy old withered crones in such a  dwelling, rather than a fair tender child, and yet she looked so happy,  and so full of joy! The opposite room had been fitted up as a kitchen,  and was clean and cold. We paced up the stairs so often trodden by  Nell's small feet, when they descended briskly to meet the lounging  heavy footfalls of her royal master, whom she loved for himself, and  careless of her own future, as she was of her own person, cared more for  the honor of the indolent Charles, than ever he cared for his own! In  nature, in feeling, in all honors _save the one_, how superior was the  poor orange-girl to her rivals; they envied and slandered each other,  disdaining no article to fix the fancy of the king, who desired nothing  more than that they should all live peaceably together, and was not able  to comprehend why they did not agree when he endeavored to please them;  they copied each other--but Nell resembled only herself. Instead of  going like the generality of her sex from bad to worse, the more her  opportunities of evil increased, the better she became. The ladies of  the court swore, drank, and gambled; it was the fashion to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25341"],[0,"The 28th: A Record of War Service in the Australian Imperial Force, 1915-19, (#9)"],[1," and the more  dignified camel, instantly carried minds back to the pictures that were  popular in childhood's days.    By midnight the last of the troops, detrained at a military siding near  by, had reached the camp and taken shelter for the time being in a  number of open-sided wooden huts.    The camp site, called Abbasia--after the adjacent quarter of Cairo, was  in the desert just north of the Suez Road and about five miles from the  centre of the city. The ground here was quite flat, and had been  extensively used at different times for military reviews. It was also  near the scene of a battle in 1517, when the Turkish conqueror, the  Sultan Selim, overthrew the Egyptians. A second battle took place here  in 1800, on which occasion General Kleber with 10,000 French defeated  six times that number of Turks. On the west side were situated the  cavalry and infantry barracks, at that time occupied by the 2nd Mounted  Division (Yeomanry). To the north lay the quarters and hospital of the  Egyptian Army units doing guard and escort duty for the new Sultan.  North-east, a little over a mile away, the new city of Heliopolis, with  its splendid buildings, was in full view. In other directions only the  desert was to be seen, marked here and there with low hills--the highest  being Jebel Ahmar, an outpost of the Moqattam Range.    The first day in the new camp was one of discomfort and worry. No  brigade or divisional staffs were present to assist and advise as to the  new conditions. The source of supplies had to be ascertained, kitchens  constructed, baggage sorted, and the lines, which were indescribably  dirty, cleaned up. All ranks were tired with the previous day's long  hours and badly needed a hot meal which, at first, could not be  satisfactorily supplied. A few men strayed away to Heliopolis, where  they found members of the 5th and 6th Brigades, whose local knowledge  they availed themselves of in their search for creature comforts.  Fortunately other friends were near in the 13th Light Horse Regiment,  which was temporarily occupying part of Abbasia Camp. The members  assisted greatly in the settling down process and, in consequence, by  the night of the third day tents were pitched, cooking arranged for, and  the comfort of the individual much improved. Very shortly after, further  advantages were provided in the shape of a regimental institute where  fruit, groceries, and liquor could be procured. This scheme was  subsequently extended in the direction of establishing a restaurant, a  fruit and ice cream tent, a newsvendor's stall, and a barber's shop.  This institute was valuable for several reasons. It afforded a means of  supplementing the indifferent ration; prevented the infliction of  exorbitant prices; guaranteed fair quality; reduced straying; ensured  the profits coming back to the battalion; and did away with the  necessity for admitting to the lines the clamorous and often filthy  multitude of hawkers. After this no Egyptian or foreigner was permitted  to approach the tents without a pass. Most of the local vendors had  methods peculiarly their own. The agents for the \"Egyptian Times\" or  \"Egyptian Gazette\" described their sheets in language which suggested  guilelessness and earlier association with the 1st Australian Division.  The orange, chocolate, and \"eggs-a-cook\" (small hard-boiled eggs)  sellers seemed to possess the faculty of rising from the earth or  dropping from the blue, for whenever bodies of troops, exercising in the  desert, halted for rest, some half-dozen of these people--not previously  in view--would suddenly appear, and, dragging their wares from somewhere  between their not over clean garments and less clean skin, would offer  them to the soldiers at \"two fer a arf\" (piastre).    Of course news of the progress of our troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula  was eagerly sought. At first information was difficult to obtain. The  only sources from which it could be gathered were the wounded and sick  in the neighbouring No. 1 Australian General Hospital housed at the  Heliopolis Palace Hotel, and the adjoining Luna Park. These men related  their own experiences and impressions. Their auditors were able to  appreciate the stupendous task of the landing parties and the heroism  with which they had held on to the ground gained under devastating  enemy fire and the ravages of disease. Of the relative positions of the  opposing forces little of a definite nature was known, nor could  anything be ascertained as to the plans for the future. The fact that so  many troops were collecting in Egypt did, however, point to probable  further developments, and gave the Battalion great hopes of being  allowed to participate. The achievements of the Western Australian units  already at the front had been proved more than worthy of emulation, and  the 28th was determined not to be found lacking.    The situation in Egypt at this time was not without cause for anxiety.  Some months earlier the Khedive Abbas Hilmi, an intriguer against Great  Britain, had been replaced by Prince Kamil Hussein, who was proclaimed  Sultan under a British protectorate. Sir Arthur Henry McMahon was High  Commissioner, but the country was virtually under martial law  administered by the G.O.C. in Egypt--Lieut.-General Sir John Maxwell.  There was more than a little unrest amongst the civil population caused  by the efforts of the Turkish and German propagandists. On the eastern  frontier precautions had to be taken to meet a repetition of the raid of  February made by Djemal Pasha on the Suez Canal. Towards the west the  attitude of the Senussi, a great religious sheik, indicated pretentions  to temporal power which must inevitably bring about a conflict. To meet  this situation there were a few brigades of the Indian Army on the  Canal,[E] whilst for the remainder dependence seemed to be placed on the  units and reinforcements passing through to the Dardanelles. Maxwell  made the most of these, and greatly impressed the populace by displays  of force. These displays consisted of marching brigades of Yeomanry and  Australians through the city and thickly populated suburbs. The 28th  Battalion frequently took part--the marches mostly being carried out at  night and forming part of the training in march discipline. The natives  looked on sullenly, but there was little in the way of openly hostile  display.    The organisation of the forces in Egypt brought the Australians under  the supreme command of Sir John Maxwell, but they, and the New  Zealanders, were grouped under the immediate command of Major-General J.  Spens and known as the Australian and New Zealand Training Depot. For  self-contained organised units this arrangement was fairly satisfactory,  but with regard to reinforcement drafts their management was the subject  of much adverse criticism. Discipline was very weak and actual training  not, apparently, a primary consideration. These defects continued for  many months. They were not due to the men themselves, but to the absence  of a policy in regard to the command and administration of training  battalions generally. In later years the Australians managed these  things for themselves, and with such good results that the British  Service found it profitable to copy some of their methods.    [Illustration: ABBASIA CAMP.  \"D\" Company marching in. Jebel Ahmar in the background.  _Photo. by Sergt. Arundel._]    [Illustration: THE ADJUTANT AND \"TIM.\"]    General Spens visited the Battalion's camp early in the morning  following its arrival. He questioned the Commanding Officer as to the  unit, and after being assured that the material was excellent, though  far from being perfectly trained, contented himself by saying \"Ah well,  give 'em plenty of shootin'.\"    On the 5th July the Battalion was drawn up to receive Sir John Maxwell.  Sir John arrived with a considerable staff, including young Prince  Leopold of Battenberg. The General closely inspected the unit, both he  and his staff commenting most favourably on what they described as a  \"magnificent regiment.\" Sir John afterwards made a short address,  referring to the work of the first four brigades and the hopes for the  future. Doubtless having in mind the recent disturbances in Cairo, he  also pointed out that Egypt was now a British Protectorate and that the  Egyptians were, equally with the Australians, British subjects. He  expressed a wish, therefore, that there would be no \"knockin' 'em  about.\"    At the date of the 28th's arrival in Egypt, one or two battalions of the  5th Brigade, and the whole of the 6th Brigade, were already in Aerodrome  Camp, just without and on the north-east side of Heliopolis. The 4th  Light Horse Brigade, minus the 13th Regiment, was also camped near by.  The complement from the \"Ascanius\" was the nucleus of the 7th Brigade.  The 27th Battalion, after landing, went first to Aerodrome Camp, but  moved to Abbasia within a fortnight. The 25th Battalion, the second half  of the 26th Battalion, and the remainder of the 5th Brigade troops did  not arrive until about a month later. About the same time, Sergt.  Faulkner and his drivers reported to their unit (8th August). They had  been detained at Blackboy Hill a month after the departure of the  \"Ascanius,\" finally embarking on the \"Boonah\" on the 12th July.  Observing instructions received, their horses had been left behind in  Western Australia and fresh teams had now to be drawn from the local  Remount Depot, in which there existed a surplus.    From the foregoing it will be seen that August had arrived before the  7th Brigade and its staff was actually mobilised and complete.[F] In  the meantime the 4th Light Horse Brigade had, for the most part, been  broken up in order to provide reinforcements for the three horseless  brigades then fighting on Gallipoli. The 13th Light Horse moved to its  own camp but retained its entity, and as such afterwards served through  the war."]]]
