One  day Mr. Rabbit surprised Mr. Weasel making a meal of young mice, and of  course he hurried to tell all his neighbors. Then Mr. Weasel knew that  it was no longer of use to pretend that he was what he was not, and he  boldly joined the bigger animals in hunting the smaller ones. It makes  most people angry to be caught in wrongdoing and it was just that way  with Mr. Weasel. He flew into a great rage and vowed that he would kill  Mr. Rabbit, and when he couldn't catch Mr. Rabbit, he hunted others of  his neighbors until there was no one, not even fierce Mr. Wolf or Mr.  Panther or Mr. Lynx, of whom the littlest people were in such fear. You  see, they could hide from the big hunters, but they couldn't hide from  Mr. Weasel because he knew all their hiding-places, and he was so slim  and small that wherever they could go, he could go.    \"Now the big people, like Mr. Wolf and Mr. Panther, killed only for  food that they might live, and when they found Mr. Weasel killing more  than he could eat, they would have nothing to do with him and even  threatened to kill him if they caught him. So pretty soon Mr. Weasel  found that he hadn't a friend in the world. This made him more savage  than ever, and he hunted and killed just for the pleasure of it. He took  pleasure in the fear which he read in the eyes of his neighbors when  they saw him.    \"Old Mother Nature was terribly shocked when she discovered what was  going on, but she found that she could do nothing with Mr. Weasel. He  wasn't sorry for what he had done and he wouldn't promise to do better.  'Very well,' said Old Mother Nature, 'from this time on you and your  children and your children's children forever and ever shall be  outcasts among the people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows,  hated by all, little and big.' And it has been so to this day. Even I am  not on speaking terms with Shadow, although he is my own cousin,\"  concluded Jimmy Skunk.    Peter Rabbit shuddered. \"Isn't it dreadful not to have a single friend?\"  he exclaimed. \"I would rather have to run for my life twenty times a day  than to be hated and feared and without a single friend. I wouldn't be  an outcast for all the world.\"    \"There's not the least bit of danger of that for you, Peter,\" laughed  Jimmy Skunk.                                            X                     HOW THE EYES OF OLD MR. OWL BECAME FIXED                                            X                     HOW THE EYES OF OLD MR. OWL BECAME FIXED      Blacky the Crow had discovered Hooty the Owl dozing the bright day away  in a thick hemlock-tree. Blacky knew that the bright light hurt Hooty's  big eyes and half blinded him. This meant that he could have no end of  fun teasing Hooty, and that Hooty would have to sit still and take it  all, because he couldn't see well enough to fly away or to try to catch  Blacky. Now if the day had been dark, as it sometimes is on cloudy days,  or if the dusk of evening had been settling over the Green Meadows and  the Green Forest, matters would have been very different. Blacky would  have taken care, the very greatest care, not to let Hooty know that he  was anywhere around. But as it was, here was a splendid chance to spoil  Hooty's sleep and to see him grow very, very angry and do it without  running any great risk.    \"Caw, caw, caw, caw, caw!\" yelled Blacky at the top of his voice, and at  once all his relatives came flocking over to join in the fun. Dear me,  dear me, such a racket as there was then! They flew over his head, and  they settled in the tree all around him, all yelling as hard as ever  they could. Everybody within hearing knew what it meant, and everybody  who dared to hurried over to watch the fun. Somehow most people seem to  take pleasure in seeing some one else made uncomfortable, especially if  it is some one of whom they stand in fear and who is for the time being  helpless.    Most of the little meadow and forest people are very much afraid of  Hooty the Owl as soon as it begins to grow dark, for that is when he can  see best and does all his hunting. So, though it wasn't at all nice of  them, they enjoyed seeing him tormented by Blacky and his relatives. But  all the time they took the greatest care to keep out of sight  themselves. Peter Rabbit was there. So was Jumper the Hare and Happy  Jack the Gray Squirrel and Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Whitefoot the  Wood Mouse and Striped Chipmunk and a lot more. Of course, Sammy Jay was  there, but Sammy didn't try to keep out of sight. Oh, my, no! He joined  right in with the Crows, calling Hooty all sorts of bad names and flying  about just out of reach in the most impudent way. You see he knew just  how helpless Hooty was.    Hooty was very, very angry. He hissed, and he snapped his bill, and he  told his tormentors what he would do to them if he caught them after  dark. And all the time he kept turning his head with its great, round,  glaring, yellow eyes so as not to give his tormentors a chance to pull  out any of his feathers, as the boldest of them tried to do. Now Hooty  can turn his head as no one else can. He can turn it so that he looks  straight back over his tail, so that his head looks as if it were put on  the wrong way. Then he can snap it around in the other direction so  quickly that you can hardly see him do it, and sometimes it seems as if  he turned his head clear around.    That interested Peter Rabbit immensely. He couldn't think of anything  else. He kept trying to do the same thing himself, but of course he  couldn't. He could turn his head sideways, but that was all. He puzzled  over it all the rest of the day, and that night, when his cousin, Jumper  the Hare, called at the dear Old Briar-patch, the first thing he did was  to ask a question.    \"Cousin Jumper, do you know why it is that Hooty the Owl can turn his  head way around, and nobody else can?\"    \"Of course I know,\" replied Jumper. \"I thought everybody knew that. It's  because his eyes are fixed in their sockets, and he can't turn them. So  he turns his whole head in order to see in all directions. The rest of  us can roll our eyes, but Hooty can't.\"    Peter scratched his long left ear with his long right hindfoot, a way he  has when he is thinking or is puzzled. \"That's funny,\" said he. \"I  wonder why his eyes are fixed.\"    \"Because his great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather rolled his eyes too  much,\" replied Jumper, yawning. \"He saw too much. It's a bad thing to  see too much.\"    \"Tell me about it. Please do, Cousin Jumper,\" begged Peter.    Jumper looked up at the moon to see what time of night it was.    \"All right,\" said he, settling himself comfortably. \"All the Owl family,  way back to the very beginning, have had very big eyes. Old Mr. Owl had  them. He could move them just as we can ours. And because they were so  big, and because he could roll them, there was very little going on that  Mr. Owl didn't see. It happened one day that Old Mother Nature took it  into her wise old head to put the little people of the Green Meadows  and the Green Forest to a test. She wanted to see just how many of them  she could trust to obey her orders. So she lined them all up in a row.  Then she made them turn so that their backs were to her.    \"'Now,' said she, 'everybody is to keep eyes to the front. I am going to  be very busy back here for a few minutes, but not one of you is to peek.  I shall know if you do, and I shall see to it that you never forget it  as long as you live.'    \"That sounded as if something dreadful might happen, so everybody sat  perfectly still looking straight before them. Some of them felt as if  they would die of curiosity to know what Old Mother Nature was doing,  but for a while no one thought of disobeying. Old Mr. Rabbit just itched  all over with curiosity. It seemed to him that he just must turn his  head. But for once he managed to get the best of his curiosity and  stared straight ahead.    \"Now Mr. Owl had tremendous great ears, just as Hooty has to-day. You  can't see them because the feathers cover them, but they are there just  the same.\"    Peter nodded. He knew all about those wonderful ears and how they heard  the teeniest, weeniest noise when Hooty was flying at night.    \"Those, big ears,\" continued Jumper, \"heard every little sound that Old  Mother Nature made, and they sounded queer to Mr. Owl. 'If I roll back  my eyes without turning my head, I believe I can see what she is doing,  and she won't be any the wiser,' thought he. So he rolled his eyes back  and then looked straight ahead again. What he had seen made him want to  see more. He tried it again. Just imagine how he felt when he found that  his eyes wouldn't roll. He couldn't move them a bit. All he could do was  to stare straight ahead. It frightened him dreadfully, and he kept  trying and trying to roll his eyes, but they were fixed fast. He could  see in only one direction, the way his head was turned.    \"When at last Old Mother Nature told all the little people that they  might look, Mr. Owl didn't want to look. He didn't want to face Old  Mother Nature, for he knew perfectly well what had happened to his eyes.  He knew that Old Mother Nature had seen him roll them back, and that as  a punishment she had fixed them so that he would always stare straight  ahead. He didn't say anything. He was too ashamed to. He flew away home  the very first chance he got. For a long time after that, Mr. Owl never  could see behind him at all. He could only turn his head part way, the  same as most folks, and he couldn't roll his eyes to see the rest of the  way. It made him dreadfully nervous and unhappy. He felt all the time as  if people were doing things behind his back. But he didn't complain. He  was ashamed to do that.    \"Old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/213"],[0,"The Man from Snowy River (#9)"],[1,"ss'd,     Was an angel smile of gladness -- she had found the boy at last.          Over the Range           Little bush maiden, wondering-eyed,      Playing alone in the creek-bed dry,     In the small green flat on every side      Walled in by the Moonbi ranges high;     Tell us the tale of your lonely life,      'Mid the great grey forests that know no change.     'I never have left my home,' she said,      'I have never been over the Moonbi Range.       'Father and mother are both long dead,      And I live with granny in yon wee place.'     'Where are your father and mother?' we said.      She puzzled awhile with thoughtful face,     Then a light came into the shy brown eye,      And she smiled, for she thought the question strange     On a thing so certain -- 'When people die      They go to the country over the range.'       'And what is this country like, my lass?'      'There are blossoming trees and pretty flowers,     And shining creeks where the golden grass      Is fresh and sweet from the summer showers.     They never need work, nor want, nor weep;      No troubles can come their hearts to estrange.     Some summer night I shall fall asleep,      And wake in the country over the range.'       Child, you are wise in your simple trust,      For the wisest man knows no more than you     Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust:      Our views by a range are bounded too;     But we know that God hath this gift in store,      That when we come to the final change,     We shall meet with our loved ones gone before      To the beautiful country over the range.          Only a Jockey            'Richard Bennison, a jockey, aged 14, while riding William Tell     in his training, was thrown and killed.  The horse is luckily uninjured.'     -- Melbourne Wire.           Out in the grey cheerless chill of the morning light,      Out on the track where the night shades still lurk;     Ere the first gleam of the sungod's returning light,      Round come the race-horses early at work.       Reefing and pulling and racing so readily,      Close sit the jockey-boys holding them hard,     'Steady the stallion there -- canter him steadily,      Don't let him gallop so much as a yard.'       Fiercely he fights while the others run wide of him,      Reefs at the bit that would hold him in thrall,     Plunges and bucks till the boy that's astride of him      Goes to the ground with a terrible fall.       'Stop him there!  Block him there!  Drive him in carefully,      Lead him about till he's quiet and cool.     Sound as a bell! though he's blown himself fearfully,      Now let us pick up this poor little fool.       'Stunned?  Oh, by Jove, I'm afraid it's a case with him;      Ride for the doctor! keep bathing his head!     Send for a cart to go down to our place with him' --      No use!  One long sigh and the little chap's dead.       Only a jockey-boy, foul-mouthed and bad you see,      Ignorant, heathenish, gone to his rest.     Parson or Presbyter, Pharisee, Sadducee,      What did you do for him? -- bad was the best.       Negroes and foreigners, all have a claim on you;      Yearly you send your well-advertised hoard,     But the poor jockey-boy -- shame on you, shame on you,      'Feed ye, my little ones' -- what said the Lord?       Him ye held less than the outer barbarian,      Left him to die in his ignorant sin;     Have you no principles, humanitarian?      Have you no precept -- 'go gather them in?'           .   .   .   .   .       Knew he God's name?  In his brutal profanity,      That name was an oath -- out of many but one --     What did he get from our famed Christianity?      Where has his soul -- if he had any -- gone?       Fourteen years old, and what was he taught of it?      What did he know of God's infinite grace?     Draw the dark curtain of shame o'er the thought of it,      Draw the shroud over the jockey-boy's face.          How M'Ginnis Went Missing           Let us cease our idle chatter,      Let the tears bedew our cheek,     For a man from Tallangatta      Has been missing for a week.       Where the roaring flooded Murray      Covered all the lower land,     There he started in a hurry,      With a bottle in his hand.       And his fate is hid for ever,      But the public seem to think     That he slumbered by the river,      'Neath the influence of drink.       And they scarcely seem to wonder      That the river, wide and deep,     Never woke him with its thunder,      Never stirred him in his sleep.       As the crashing logs came sweeping,      And their tumult filled the air,     Then M'Ginnis murmured, sleeping,      ''Tis a wake in ould Kildare.'       So the river rose and found him      Sleeping softly by the stream,     And the cruel waters drowned him      Ere he wakened from his dream.       And the blossom-tufted wattle,      Blooming brightly on the lea,     Saw M'Ginnis and the bottle      Going drifting out to sea.          A Voice from the Town            A sequel to [Mowbray Morris's] 'A Voice from the Bush'           I thought, in the days of the droving,      Of steps I might hope to retrace,     To be done with the bush and the roving      And settle once more in my place.     With a heart that was well nigh to breaking,      In the long, lonely rides on the plain,     I thought of the pleasure of taking      The hand of a lady again.       I am back into civilisation,      Once more in the stir and the strife,     But the old joys have lost their sensation --      The light has gone out of my life;     The men of my time they have married,      Made fortunes or gone to the wall;     Too long from the scene I have tarried,      And, somehow, I'm out of it all.       For I go to the balls and the races      A lonely companionless elf,     And the ladies bestow all their graces      On others less grey than myself;     While the talk goes around I'm a dumb one      'Midst youngsters that chatter and prate,     And they call me 'the Man who was Someone      Way back in the year Sixty-eight.'       And I look, sour and old, at the dancers      That swing to the strains of the band,     And the ladies all give me the Lancers,      No waltzes -- I quite understand.     For matrons intent upon matching      Their daughters with infinite push,     Would scarce think him worthy the catching,      The broken-down man from the bush.       New partners have come and new faces,      And I, of the bygone brigade,     Sharply feel that oblivion my place is --      I must lie with the rest in the shade.     And the youngsters, fresh-featured and pleasant,      They live as we lived -- fairly fast;     But I doubt if the men of the present      Are as good as the men of the past.       Of excitement and praise they are chary,      There is nothing much good upon earth;     Their watchword is _NIL ADMIRARI_,      They are bored from the days of their birth.     Where the life that we led was a revel      They 'wince and relent and refrain' --     I could show them the road -- to the devil,      Were I only a youngster again.       I could show them the road where the stumps are      The pleasures that end in remorse,     And the game where the Devil's three trumps are,      The woman, the card, and the horse.     Shall the blind lead the blind -- shall the sower      Of wind reap the storm as of yore?     Though they get to their goal somewhat slower,      They march where we hurried before.       For the world never learns -- just as we did,      They gallantly go to their fate,     Unheeded all warnings, unheeded      The maxims of elders sedate.     As the husbandman, patiently toiling,      Draws a harvest each year from the soil,     So the fools grow afresh for the spoiling,      And a new crop of thieves for the spoil.       But a truce to this dull moralising,      Let them drink while the drops are of gold,     I have tasted the dregs -- 'twere surprising      Were the new wine to me like the old;     And I weary for lack of employment      In idleness day after day,     For the key to the door of enjoyment      Is Youth -- and I've thrown it away.          A Bunch of Roses           Roses ruddy and roses white,      What are the joys that my heart discloses?     Sitting alone in the fading light     Memories come to me here to-night      With the wonderful scent of the big red roses.       Memories come as the daylight fades      Down on the hearth where the firelight dozes;     Flicker and flutter the lights and shades,     And I see the face of a queen of maids      Whose memory comes with the scent of roses.       Visions arise of a scene of mirth,      And a ball-room belle that superbly poses --     A queenly woman of queenly worth,     And I am the happiest man on earth      With a single flower from a bunch of roses.       Only her memory lives to-night --      God in His wisdom her young life closes;     Over her grave may the turf be light,     Cover her coffin with roses white --      She was always fond of the big white roses.           .   .   .   .   .       Such are the visions that fade away --      Man proposes and God disposes;     Look in the glass and I see to-day     Only an old man, worn and grey,      Bending his head to a bunch of roses.          Black Swans           As I lie at rest on a patch of clover     In the Western Park when the day is done,     I watch as the wild black swans fly over     With their phalanx turned to the sinking sun;     And I hear the clang of their leader crying     To a lagging mate in the rearward flying,     And they fade away in the darkness dying,     Where the stars are mustering one by one.       Oh! ye wild black swans, 'twere a world of wonder     For a while to join in your westward flight,     With the stars above and the dim earth under,     Through the cooling air of the glorious night.
