It was full of people  in their Sunday clothes.  My appearance attracted some notice, I was  pitied by some, execrated by others, and followed by crowds of boys.  After waiting in the street some time I was taken before a stout,  growling old gentleman, who ordered me to be locked up until the next  morning, and to have meat and drink given me.  I was then to be taken to  Liverpool and delivered over to my gaoler again.  In accordance with this  order I was put into a small square room, on the floor of which was a  quantity of straw.  There were benches fixed in the walls.  There was no  fire-place and it was sadly uncomfortable.  However, soon after I was  locked up, I received a good supply of bread, meat, and beer; and, as the  straw was tolerably fresh and clean, I did not fare so badly.  I  therefore lay down, covered myself up with the straw, and was soon fast  asleep.  I awoke once, but as everything was dark, I composed myself to  sleep again and did not awake until morning.  About six o'clock, as I  knew by the church-clock hard by, I was aroused and told to be ready to  start for Liverpool, whereupon I presented myself at the door, and found  an open cart in waiting.  Into this I was put, and, after a tiresome  journey over some of the worst roads I had ever seen in my life, I  arrived here last night, having enjoyed a three months' holiday to my  great satisfaction.  Here, then, I am, waiting for death or peace to  release me.  I shall now finish your box if you are not too offended with  me for neglecting your commission so long.  I may tell you that  Mademoiselle P--- was here this morning; tears were in her lovely eyes,  and she seemed very glad to see me back, at which I somewhat wondered,  especially if she esteemed me.  I should have thought she would rather  have relished my escaping altogether, than being again caught.\"    Here ends Durand's narrative.    My father appends a note to the effect that, through the intervention of  Sir Edward Cunliffe, one of the members for Liverpool, Durand was  released from the Tower, and went to reside with Mr. P--- in Dale-street.  At the date of September following there is a memorandum to the effect  that M. Durand and Miss P--- had become man and wife, so that, as my  father quaintly adds, he supposes M. Durand had by that time found out  why it was that old P---'s niece was so glad to see him again in prison.    The House of Correction stood at the back of the present Fever Hospital,  the entrance being in Mount Pleasant.  It was in Mr. Howard's time a most  miserably managed place.  In 1790 it was a vile hole of iniquity.  There  was a whipping-post, for instance, in the yard, at which females were  weekly in the receipt of punishment.  There was also \"a cuckstool,\" or  ducking tub, where refractory prisoners were brought to their senses, and  in which persons on their first admission into the gaol were ducked, if  they refused or could not pay \"a garnish.\"  This barbarous mode of  punishment was common in Lancashire, and Cheshire.  This prison was in  the course of the following years much improved, as it was found by Mr.  Neild very clean and orderly through the exertions of Mrs. Widdows, the  keeper.  Mrs. Widdow's salary was 63 pounds per annum.  She had  resolutely put down the cuckstool, and the whipping-post was becoming in  a complete state of desuetude.  A pump in the men's yard was used as a  place of occasional punishment for the stubborn and refractory.  The  prisoners were without any instruction, secular or religious.  No  chaplain attended.  The allowance to each prisoner was a two-penny loaf,  two pounds of potatoes, and salt daily.  I believe, from all I could  learn, that the Liverpool prisons, bad as they undoubtedly were at the  close of the last and the beginning of the present century, were in  better condition than others elsewhere.          CHAPTER III.      One of my great-grandsons--a fine young fellow, has joined the  Volunteers: and seems determined to work his way to a commission.  I  cannot help smiling when I see him in his uniform, for he reminds me of  my young days, when I was a full private in Pudsey Dawson's Liverpool  Volunteers.  I don't think the volunteers of this day are so  smart-looking as they were of olden time, when they wore blue coats,  white breeches, gaiters and pig-tails, and used pipe-clay in abundance.  When we were reviewed on Moss-Lake Fields we made a gallant show.  There  are fine young fellows now, but somehow the dark rifle-dress looks sombre  and dull.  Pudsey Dawson's regiment consisted of eight companies of  infantry, and mustered 1200 strong.    The mettle of the Liverpool men was shown in 1797, for some time about  the end of February or the beginning of March, in that year the whole  town was put into the utmost fright, confusion and excitement.  Two  French frigates having landed in Cardigan Bay upwards of 2,000 men, it  was reported in Liverpool (the report being traced to the master of a  little Welsh coasting smack, who had come from Cardigan) that the French  were marching on to Liverpool to burn, sack and plunder it, in revenge  for the frigates which had been launched from her yards, and the immense  losses sustained by the French mercantile marine through the privateers  that hailed from this port.  Owing to the low state of education then  prevalent amongst the lower--and, indeed, in the middle classes--very few  knew where Cardigan Bay was situated and I very much question whether, if  a map of Europe, or of England and Wales, had been shown, nine people out  of ten could, without much difficulty, have pointed out the place.  But  that the French had landed in Cardigan Bay was a known fact; and it was  firmly believed that they were on their way to Liverpool, destroying  every thing on their march.  It was fully believed also that the  privateers which swarmed out of our docks were the cause of this  exhibition of ill-feeling towards us.  It may be fairly stated that the  enormous sums obtained by captures from the enemy by Liverpool privateers  proved the main foundation-stone of the present great prosperity of the  port.  I must say I was and am proud of my fellow townsmen's spirit in  '97, and their show of pluck.  No sooner was the report current that the  French might be expected, than meetings took place at which his Worship  the Mayor and the authorities generally, exhibited the most lively  feeling towards supporting their fellow citizens in their intention of  defending the port, their homes, and hearths, from the ruthless invaders.  Men, money, and arms, came forth freely, and even boys--mere  lads--urgently begged to be allowed to join the ranks of England's bold  defenders.  But I must not conceal the fact that, in many cases, great  cowardice was exhibited; as, when the report got current and the cry was  rife that \"the French were coming\"--a cry that used to frighten naughty  children to the verge of terror--numbers of the inhabitants became  panic-struck, and actually packed up their furniture and valuables, and  commenced a hasty exodus believing that they would be safer inland than  by the seaboard.  I saw cartload after cartload of goods, toiling up  Prescot-road, Brownlow-hill, Mount Pleasant, Oldhall-street, and  Preston-road, accompanied by weeping and terrified women and children,  with the deepest anxiety exhibited on their countenances.  The outskirt  roads were like a fair.  It will scarcely be believed that the price of  cartage rose so high while the panic lasted, that fabulous sums were  asked and obtained for transporting goods out of town.  It at length  became impossible to obtain a vehicle of any description.  Hundreds of  persons might be seen camping along the high roads at some distance from  the town, anxiously awaiting the expected sound of cannon, the clash of  arms, and the cry of contending men.  I laugh at this now--but it was no  laughing matter then.  I recollect one day passing down Dale-street (then  a narrow, inconvenient thoroughfare) to muster, when the Warrington and  Manchester coach was about to start: numbers of frightened people  besieged it and attempted to turn out and off those who had obtained  possession of its lumbering inside and its miserable basket behind.  In  it I remember was seated a tremendous man, a town councillor, who fairly  roared and cried like a child because the driver would not hasten his  departure--the cry of \"the French\" annihilated him, and I had half a mind  to let off my fire-lock and see what the result would have been.  We were  not much addicted to punctuality in those good old times; so that half an  hour's delay in the starting of a coach was held as nothing very  important--the delay however seemed a year to the worthy magnate.    In the town the utmost excitement prevailed.  At the Pier Heads, at the  Fort, and in St. Nicholas's churchyard (in the lower part of which there  was a battery of six guns) might have been seen hundreds of stalwart  fellows strengthening the fortifications; men in and out of uniform were  marching through the town with drum and fife, some armed and some  unarmed, coming and going from or to the rendezvous.  The jolly sailors  in the port mustered strong, and hearty were their demonstrations of  enthusiasm.  The shops were shut in many of the streets, while barricades  were prepared at the street ends leading out of town, ready to be put up  at any moment.  Information was then so slow in its journeyings that  falsehood became as strong-looking as truth, and it was easy to keep up a  ferment for some time.  Any atom of news became a mountain, until the  fresh air of truth melted it away.  We were therefore kept for days in a  state of great excitement, and it certainly was some time before our  warlike spirit subsided, and I must say that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],[0,"Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#9)"],[1,"exed, Jack turned to Chicory as if it  was his fault.  But the boy had climbed an old ant-hill, and was  watching the flying herd with his eyes shaded by his hand.    \"One down--two down,\" he cried, sending joy through Jack's breast; for,  on galloping after the herd, it was to find one bok lying dead, and  another so badly wounded that it became an easy capture.    It was with no little importance then that Jack rode back with his two  bok, ready to receive the congratulations of his father, for his  manifest improvement in handling his rifle, and in hunting the bok  according to the accepted plan.    At last their guide, after looking-on with something almost supercilious  in his face at this, to him, puny style of hunting, and contentment with  such small game as birds, springbok, and the like, announced that the  next day they would be entering upon what he termed his hunting country.    The travellers had now reached a more rugged tract of land, scored with  deep ravines, along which, at some time or another, small rivers must  have coursed, while now the narrow stony tracks were found convenient  for waggon tracks, though often enough the way was cruelly difficult,  and all had to set to and clear a passage for the wheels by bodily  removing some of the worst of the stones.    There was no hesitation or hanging back at such times, for all had to  set to, even Dinny playing a pretty good part, considering that he  abhorred manual labour.    Quite a change seemed to have come over the General, as Dick aptly  dubbed their Zulu guide; for though he gave way in everything connected  with the management of the waggon, and was exceedingly respectful to Mr  Rogers, no sooner did any hunting matter come to the front, or a  question of the best direction to take, than he seemed to take the lead  as if in spite of himself.    At first Mr Rogers felt annoyed, and ready to put the man down; but in  a very short time he saw that the Zulu's sole thought was for the  success of the expedition, and that his actions were the natural results  of his former life; for, savage though he was, and servant to this  expedition, he had been a prince in his own tribe, and a leader amongst  the people.    The night was coming on fast, when one day, after a long and weary trek,  the heavily-laden waggon was approaching a belt of elevated forest-land,  where the General had assured Mr Rogers they would find water.    It had been a toilsome day, hot and dusty, and at their midday rest  there had been hardly a mouthful of herbage for the tired oxen, while  water there was none.  The contents of the two casks swinging behind the  waggon were jealously guarded for the travellers' use; but so miserable  did the cattle seem that the two boys asked their father to tap one of  them for the oxen and horses.    \"It will be but a taste a-piece,\" he said; \"but perhaps you are right,  boys.\"    Then the tap being set running, every ox and horse had a refreshing  taste, though it was hard work to get the pail away from each thirsty  mouth.    Then all through that long parching afternoon they had toiled on, with  the draught cattle growing more listless, the horses sluggish and  restless; and a general feeling of weariness seemed to have seized upon  all.    The result was shown in the silence with which they progressed.  The  driver and foreloper ceased to shout and crack their whips; the Zulus  trudged slowly on behind the waggon; and out of compassion for their  horses, Mr Rogers and his sons walked beside the weary beasts.    \"You are sure we shall find water at sundown?\" said Dick to the General.    \"Nothing is sure out in the wilds, young master,\" said the Zulu gravely.  \"There should be water there.  If there is not, we must trek on through  the night, to the first river or spring.\"    \"But will there be water there?\"    \"We shall be in the game country then, and I can soon find where the  game goes to drink, and can lead you there.\"    This was satisfactory, and they trudged on and on, with the land  gradually rising, making the pull more heavy for the oxen, whose tongues  were lolling out, and whose efforts at last became so painful that Mr  Rogers at once accepted his sons' proposal, which was that the horses  should help.    A halt was called, and great stones were placed beneath the wheels to  make sure that there should be no running backwards on the part of the  waggon, and then the tethering ropes were fastened to the horses'  saddles; the Zulus and the boys took their head; the word was given to  start; the ropes that had been secured to different parts of the waggon  tightened; and though the horses could not pull as if they were properly  harnessed, the impulse they gave relieved the weary oxen, and after half  an hour's toilsome drag, the waggon was drawn to the top of the incline,  and the travellers had the pleasure of seeing that a tolerably level way  lay before them.    But there was no sign of water, and Mr Rogers looked serious as he  swept the dimly seen country before him with his glass.    \"Had we not better outspan here?\" he said, \"and let the oxen rest.  We  could start again at daybreak.\"    But the General shook his head.    \"No, boss,\" he replied.  \"Let us go on.  We may find water yet.\"    Mr Rogers gave way, and in a listless, weary fashion the heavy waggon  was dragged on.    \"Oh, I am so tired,\" cried Jack; \"and I'd give anything to be able to  walk right into a big pond and drink, and soak myself outside.  My skin  feels as if it was cracking.\"    \"I'm very tired, too,\" said Dick; \"but not so tired as I thought I  should be.  Why I must have walked twenty miles to-day.  I wonder  whether that means that I am growing stronger.\"    \"You need not wonder,\" said Mr Rogers, who had heard his words.  \"You  may be sure, my boy.  But how dark it is growing!  There are the stars.\"    \"What's the matter with the bullocks?\" cried Jack suddenly.  \"Why,  father, they're gone mad with thirst.\"    \"Water,\" cried the General, pointing ahead.  \"They smell the water.\"    The sensitiveness was caught up by the horses, which, like the oxen,  quickened their pace, craning with outstretched muzzles, their fine  instinct telling them that there was water on ahead, towards which they  struggled to get.    Great care was needed now lest the water should prove to be merely a  well or pool, into which the bullocks would rush, muddying the water,  and perhaps trampling one another to death in their efforts to reach the  refreshing liquid.  But strive hard as they would, it proved to be  impossible to keep the thirsty creatures back.  The waggon had not  proceeded so fast since they started; and the speed was growing greater,  causing the great lumbering vehicle to rock and sway in a most alarming  fashion.  If they had encountered a rock, however small, there must have  been a crash.  But as it happened, they came on very level ground,  sloping gently towards the north.    Klipmann, the foremost ox, a great black fellow with long horns, had  proclaimed the find, and communicated the fact with a deep-mouthed  bellow; and the next minute all was excitement and shouting, as the  great waggon thundered and groaned along.    The first thing to be done was to detach the horses, which was no sooner  done than they seemed to take fright, and went off at a gallop into the  gloom ahead; then, amidst the yells and shoutings of Peter and Dirk, who  danced about as if mad, efforts were made to check the oxen; but the  poor beasts were frantic with thirst, and any serious attempt to stop  them would have meant goring, trampling down, or being crushed by the  wheels of the ponderous waggon.    The wild race lasted for a mile, during which every moment threatened to  be the waggon's last.  The oxen lowed and trotted on, the waggon  creaked, and the loose articles rattled and banged together.  Mr Rogers  and his sons panted on at the sides, momentarily expecting to see it go  over, and Coffee and Chicory, who had been very slow and silent for  hours, whooped and yelled and added to the excitement.    \"It's all over with our trip, Jack,\" panted Dick.  \"We shall have to  pick up the pieces to-morrow and go back.\"    \"Wait a bit, and let's see.  Why, what's the General going to do?\"    For all at once the Zulu had darted on ahead after snatching a kiri from  Chicory's hand, seized the foremost bullock, old Klipmann, by the horn,  and, at the risk of being impaled or trampled down, he beat the stubborn  bullock over the head with the club, and treating the other, its  yoke-fellow, the same, he forced them into taking a different course,  almost at right angles to that which they were pursuing.    \"Stop, stop!\" roared Mr Rogers.  \"You will upset the waggon.\"    But he was too late.  The course of the leading oxen being changed, the  others swerved round, giving such a tug at the dissel-boom that the  waggon's wreck seemed certain.  The whole team taking, as it did, a  different course, the waggon was dragged side-wise, and for a few  seconds tottered on its two nearside, or left-hand, wheels.    It seemed as if it must go over crash--that nothing could save it; and  Jack uttered a cry of dismay, and warning to his brother to get out of  the way.  Then, as if by a miracle, it fell back with a heavy thud on to  the other wheels, and bumped and jolted on after the long team of oxen  into the obscurity.  And then, when ruin seemed to have come completely  upon the expedition, _wish-wash_! _splish-splash_! the foaming of  water--the crunching of wheels over stones and sand--a quick rush--and  the waggon was standing, axletree deep, in a swiftly flowing river, down  whose shelving bank it had been dragged, and in whose cool waters the  oxen and horses were washing their legs, and drinking deeply with  delight.
