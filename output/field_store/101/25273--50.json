He cannot, like the poet or  historian, expatiate, and impress the mind with great veneration for the  character of the hero or saint he represents, though he lets us know at  the same time that the saint was deformed, or the hero lame.  The painter  has no other means of giving an idea of the dignity of the mind, but by  that external appearance which grandeur of thought does generally, though  not always, impress on the countenance, and by that correspondence of  figure to sentiment and situation which all men wish, but cannot command.  The painter, who may in this one particular attain with ease what others  desire in vain, ought to give all that he possibly can, since there are  so many circumstances of true greatness that he cannot give at all.  He  cannot make his hero talk like a great man; he must make him look like  one.  For which reason he ought to be well studied in the analysis of  those circumstances which constitute dignity of appearance in real life.    As in invention, so likewise in, expression, care must be taken not to  run into particularities, Those expressions alone should be given to the  figures which their respective situations generally produce.  Nor is this  enough; each person should also have that expression which men of his  rank generally exhibit.  The joy or the grief of a character of dignity  is not to be expressed in the same manner as a similar passion in a  vulgar face.  Upon this principle Bernini, perhaps, may be subject to  censure.  This sculptor, in many respects admirable, has given a very  mean expression to his statue of David, who is represented as just going  to throw the stone from the sling; and in order to give it the expression  of energy he has made him biting his under-lip.  This expression is far  from being general, and still farther from being dignified.  He might  have seen it in an instance or two, and he mistook accident for  universality.    With respect to colouring, though it may appear at first a part of  painting merely mechanical, yet it still has its rules, and those  grounded upon that presiding principle which regulates both the great and  the little in the study of a painter.  By this, the first effect of the  picture is produced; and as this is performed the spectator, as he walks  the gallery, will stop, or pass along.  To give a general air of grandeur  at first view, all trifling or artful play of little lights or an  attention to a variety of tints is to be avoided; a quietness and  simplicity must reign over the whole work; to which a breadth of uniform  and simple colour will very much contribute.  Grandeur of effect is  produced by two different ways, which seem entirely opposed to each  other.  One is, by reducing the colours to little more than chiaroscuro,  which was often the practice of the Bolognian schools; and the other, by  making the colours very distinct and forcible, such as we see in those of  Rome and Florence; but still, the presiding principle of both those  manners is simplicity.  Certainly, nothing can be more simple than  monotony, and the distinct blue, red, and yellow colours which are seen  in the draperies of the Roman and Florentine schools, though they have  not that kind of harmony which is produced by a variety of broken and  transparent colours, have that effect of grandeur that was intended.  Perhaps these distinct colours strike the mind more forcibly, from there  not being any great union between them; as martial music, which is  intended to rouse the noble passions, has its effect from the sudden and  strongly marked transitions from one note to another, which that style of  music requires; whilst in that which is intended to move the softer  passions the notes imperceptibly melt into one another.    In the same manner as the historical painter never enters into the detail  of colours, so neither does he debase his conceptions with minute  attention to the discriminations of drapery.  It is the inferior style  that marks the variety of stuffs.  With him, the clothing is neither  woollen, nor linen, nor silk, satin, or velvet: it is drapery; it is  nothing more.  The art of disposing the foldings of the drapery make a  very considerable part of the painter's study.  To make it merely natural  is a mechanical operation, to which neither genius or taste are required;  whereas, it requires the nicest judgment to dispose the drapery, so that  the folds have an easy communication, and gracefully follow each other,  with such natural negligence as to look like the effect of chance, and at  the same time show the figure under it to the utmost advantage.    Carlo Maratti was of opinion that the disposition of drapery was a more  difficult art than even that of drawing the human figure; that a student  might be more easily taught the latter than the former; as the rules of  drapery, he said, could not be so well ascertained as those for  delineating a correct form, This, perhaps, is a proof how willingly we  favour our own peculiar excellence.  Carlo Maratti is said to have valued  himself particularly upon his skill in this part of the art yet in him  the disposition appears so artificial, that he is inferior to Raffaelle,  even in that which gave him his best claim to reputation.    Such is the great principle by which we must be directed in the nobler  branches of our art.  Upon this principle the Roman, the Florentine, the  Bolognese schools, have formed their practice; and by this they have  deservedly obtained the highest praise.  These are the three great  schools of the world in the epic style.  The best of the French school,  Poussin, Le Sueur, and Le Brun, have formed themselves upon these models,  and consequently may be said, though Frenchmen, to be a colony from the  Roman school.  Next to these, but in a very different style of  excellence, we may rank the Venetian, together with the Flemish and the  Dutch schools, all professing to depart from the great purposes of  painting, and catching at applause by inferior qualities.    I am not ignorant that some will censure me for placing the Venetians in  this inferior class, and many of the warmest admirers of painting will  think them unjustly degraded; but I wish not to be misunderstood.  Though  I can by no means allow them to hold any rank with the nobler schools of  painting, they accomplished perfectly the thing they attempted.  But as  mere elegance is their principal object, as they seem more willing to  dazzle than to affect, it can be no injury to them to suppose that their  practice is useful only to its proper end.  But what may heighten the  elegant may degrade the sublime.  There is a simplicity, and I may add,  severity, in the great manner, which is, I am afraid, almost incompatible  with this comparatively sensual style.    Tintoret, Paul Veronese, and others of the Venetian schools, seem to have  painted with no other purpose than to be admired for their skill and  expertness in the mechanism of painting, and to make a parade of that art  which, as I before observed, the higher style requires its followers to  conceal.    In a conference of the French Academy, at which were present Le Brun,  Sebastian Bourdon, and all the eminent artists of that age, one of the  academicians desired to have their opinion on the conduct of Paul  Veronese, who, though a painter of great consideration, had, contrary to  the strict rules of art, in his picture of Perseus and Andromeda,  represented the principal figure in shade.  To this question no  satisfactory answer was then given.  But I will venture to say, that if  they had considered the class of the artist, and ranked him as an  ornamental painter, there would have been no difficulty in answering: \"It  was unreasonable to expect what was never intended.  His intention was  solely to produce an effect of light and Shadow; everything was to be  sacrificed to that intent, and the capricious composition of that picture  suited very well with the style he professed.\"    Young minds are indeed too apt to be captivated by this splendour of  style, and that of the Venetians will be particularly pleasing; for by  them all those parts of the art that give pleasure to the eye or sense  have been cultivated with care, and carried to the degree nearest to  perfection.  The powers exerted in the mechanical part of the art have  been called the language of painters; but we must say, that it is but  poor eloquence which only shows that the orator can talk.  Words should  be employed as the means, not as the end: language is the instrument,  conviction is the work.    The language of painting must indeed be allowed these masters; but even  in that they have shown more copiousness than choice, and more luxuriancy  than judgment.  If we consider the uninteresting subjects of their  invention, or at least the uninteresting manner in which they are  treated; if we attend to their capricious composition, their violent and  affected contrasts, whether of figures, or of light and shadow, the  richness of their drapery, and, at the same time, the mean effect which  the discrimination of stuffs gives to their pictures; if to these we add  their total inattention to expression, and then reflect on the  conceptions and the learning of Michael Angelo, or the simplicity of  Raffaelle, we can no longer dwell on the comparison.  Even in colouring,  if we compare the quietness and chastity of the Bolognese pencil to the  bustle and tumult that fills every part of, a Venetian picture, without  the least attempt to interest the passions, their boasted art will appear  a mere struggle without effect; an empty tale told by an idiot, full of  sound and fury, signifying nothing.    Such as suppose that the great style might happily be blended with the  ornamental, that the simple, grave, and majestic dignity of Raffaelle  could unite with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21781"],[0,"Text Book of Biology, Part 1: Vertebrata (#9)"],[1,"an osteoclast.    * The formation of bone is called ossification. To ossify is to become  bony.      Section 72. The great thing to notice about this is that cartilage does  not become bone, but is eaten into and ousted by it; the osteoblasts  and osteoclasts replace entirely the cartilage corpuscles, and are  not derived from them.      Section 73. We may mention here the structure of the spleen  (Figure 1, Sheet 1). It consists of a connective tissue and muscular  coating, with an internal soft matrix much resembling botryoidal  tissue, traversed by fibrous trabeculne (= beams, planks) containing  blood-vessels, and the whole organ is gorged with blood, particularly  after meals. The consideration of its function the student may  conveniently defer for the present.      Section 74. Here also, we may notice the lymphatics, a series of  small vessels which return the overflow of the blood serum from the  capillaries, in the nutrition of the tissues in all parts of the body,  to the thoracic duct (see Section 36), and the general circulation. At  intervals their course is interrupted by gland-like dilatations, the  lymphatic glands, in which masses of rapidly dividing and growing  (proliferating) cells occur, of which, doubtless, many are detached and  become, first \"lymph corpuscles,\" and, when they reach the veins,  white blood corpuscles.        5. _The Skeleton_    Section 75. We are now in a position to study the rabbit's skeleton.  We strongly recommend the student to do this with the actual bones  at hand-- they may be cleared very easily in a well-boiled rabbit. This  recommendation may appear superfluous to some readers, but, as a  matter of fact, the marked proclivity of the average schoolmaster for  mere book-work has put such a stamp on study, that, in nine cases  out of ten, a student, unless he is expressly instructed to the  contrary, will go to the tortuous, and possibly inexact, descriptions  of a book for a knowledge of things that lie at his very finger-tips. We  have not written, this chapter to give a complete knowledge of the  skeleton, but simply as an aid in the actual examination of the bones.      Section 76. We may take the skeleton under five headings. There is  the central axis, the chain of little bones, the vertebrae, threaded  on the spinal cord (see Figure 1 and Section 1); the thorax, the box  enclosed by ribs and sternum; the fore-limb and bones connected  with it (pectoral girdle and limb), and the hind-limb and bones  connected with it (pelvic girdle). Finally there is the skull, but  following the London University syllabus, we shall substitute the  skull of the dog for of that of the rabbit, as more typically mammalian  (Section 4).      Section 77. In Section 3 (which the student should refer to) we have  a division of the vertebrae into four varieties. Of these most  representative is the thoracic. A thoracic vertebra (Figure 4, Sheet  5, T.V.) consists of a central bony mass, the body or centrum (b.),  from which there arises dorsally an arch, the neural arch (n.a.),  completed by a keystone, the neural spine (n.s.); and coming off  laterally from the arch is the transverse process (tr.p.). Looking at  the vertebra sideways, we see that the arch is notched, for the exit  of nerves. Jointed to the thoracic vertebrae on either side are the ribs  (r.). Each rib has a process, the tuberculum, going up to articulate  with the transverse process, and one, the capitulum articulating  between the bodies of two contiguous vertebrae. The facets for the  articulation of the capitulum are indicated in the side view by  shading. At either end of the body of a vertebra of a young rabbit are  bony caps, the epiphyses (ep.), separated from the body by a plane  of unossified cartilage (indicated, by the dots). These epiphyses to  the vertebral bodies occur only among mammals, and are even absent  in some cases within the class. In the adult rabbit they have ossified  continuously with the rest of the body.      Section 78. A cervical vertebra (C.V.) seems, upon cursory  inspection, to have no rib. The transverse processes differ from those  of thoracic series in having a perforation, the vertebrarterial canal,  through which the vertebral artery runs up the neck. A study of the  development of these bones shows that the part marked f.r. ossifies  separately from the rest of the transverse process; and the form of the  equivalent structures in certain peculiar lower mammals and in  reptiles leaves no doubt that f.r. is really an abbreviated rib; fused up  with the transverse process and body. The two anterior cervical  vertebrae are peculiar. The first (at.) is called the Atlas-- the figure  shows the anterior view-- and has great articular faces for the  condyles (Section 86) of the skull, and a deficient centrum. The next  is the axis, and it is distinguished by an odontoid peg (od.p.), which  fits into the space where the body of the atlas is deficient. In  development the centrum of the axis ossifies from one centre, and the  odontoid, peg from another, which at that time occupies the position  of centrum of the atlas. So that it would seem that the atlas is a  vertebra minus a centrum, and the axis is a vertebra plus a centrum,  added at the expense of the atlas.      Section 79. The lumbar vertebrae (l.v.) are larger, and have cleft  transverse processes, each giving rise to an ascending limb, the  metapophyses, and a descending one. The latter (generally spoken of  as the transverse processes) point steeply downward, and are  considerably longer than those of thoracic series. The sacral  vertebrae (s.v.) have great flattened transverse propcesses for  articulation with the ilia. The caudal vertebrae (c.v.) are gradually  reduced to the mere elongated centra, as we proceed, towards the tip  of the tail.      Section 80. All the vertebrae join with their adjacent fellows through  the intermediation of certain intervertebral pads, and also articulate by  small processes at either end at the upper side of the arch,  the zygapophyses. The normals to the polished facets of these point,  in the case of the anterior zygapophyses, up and in (mnemonic:  ant-up-in), and in the case of the posterior, down and out. The student  should make this, and the other features of vertebrae, out upon actual  specimens.      Section 81. The thorax is bounded dorsally by the vertebral column,  and ventrally by the sternum. The sternum consists of segments,  the sternebrae (st.); anteriorly there is a bony manubrium (mb.),  posteriorly a thin cartilaginous plate, the xiphisternum (xi.). Seven  pairs of ribs articulate by cartilaginous ends (sternal ribs) with the  sternum directly, as indicated in the figure; five (false) ribs are joined,  to each other and to the seventh, and not to the sternum directly.  The last four ribs have no tuberculum (Section 77).      Section 82. The fore-limb (pectoral limb) consists of an upper arm  bone, the humerus (hum.) the distal end of which is deeply  excavated by the olecranon fossa (o.f.) as indicated by the dotted  lines; of two bones, the ulna (u.) and radius (r.) which are firmly bound  by ligament in the position of the figure (i.e., with the palm of the hand  downward, \"prone\"); of a number of small bones (carpalia), the carpus  (c.); of a series of metacarpals (mc.); and of three digits (= fingers)  each, except the first, or pollex, of three small bones-- the phalanges,  only the proximal of which appear in the figure. The ulna has a  hook-like head, the olecranon (o.) which distinguishes it easily from  the distally thickened radius. The limb is attached to the body through  the intermediation of the shoulder-blade (scapula, sc.) a flattened  bone with a median external ridge with a hook-like termination, the  acromion (acr.). There is also a process overhanging the glenoid  cavity (g.) wherein the humerus articulates, which process is called  coracoid (co.); it is ossified from two separate centres, and represents  a very considerable bone in the bird, reptile, and frog. Along the dorsal  edge of the scapula of the rabbit is unossified cartilage, which is  called the supra-scapula (s.sc.). In man there runs from the acromion  to the manubrium of the sternum a bone, the collar-bone or clavicle.  This is represented by a very imperfectly ossified rudiment in the  rabbit. The scapula and clavicle, the bones of the body connected  with the fore-limb, are frequently styled the pectoral girdle, or  shoulder-girdle; this name of girdle will appear less of a misnomer  when lower vertebrate types are studied.      Section 83. The hind limb and its body bones-- pelvic limb and  girdle-- are shown in Figure 2. The limb skeleton corresponds  closely with that of the fore-limb. The femur (fe.) answers to the  humerus, and is to be distinguished from it by the greater  distinctness of its proximal head (hd.) and by the absence of an  olecranon fossa from its distal end. The tibia (ti = the radius) is fused  for the distal half of its length with the fibula (fb. = ulna). A tarsus  (tarsalia) equals the carpus.* Two of the proximal tarsalia may be  noted: one working like a pulley under the tibia, is the astragalus  (as.); one forming the bony support of the heel, is the calcaneum  (ca.). There is a series of metatarsals, and then come four digits of  three phalanges each.    * Such a resemblance as exists between one vertebra and another in  the rabbit, or between the humerus and the femur, is called serial  homology; the two things correspond with each other to the extent of  imperfect reduplication. \"Homology\" simply is commonly used to  indicate the resemblance between any two structures in different  animals, in origin and position as regards other parts. Thus the heart  of the rabbit and of the frog are homologous structures, corresponding  in position, and resembling each other much as two memory  sketches of one picture might do.      Section 84.
