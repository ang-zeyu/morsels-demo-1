'This shall make thee remember me when next thou seest me, knight,' he  said. 'But thou hadst better do what thou camest for, and fill thyself  with mead.'    'Thou sayest sooth,' said Balin, and clutched the sword under his robe.  'Too long hast thou done evil and despite, and now will I do that for  which I came.'    Rising, he drew his sword fiercely and swiftly, and cleaved the head of  Garlon to the shoulders.    'Give me the truncheon wherewith he slew thy brother!' said Balin to  the damsel beside him.    From beneath her robe the lady brought forth the broken truncheon, and  striding to the slain man, Sir Balin thrust it fiercely into his body.    'Now,' cried he aloud, 'with this lance thou didst treacherously slay a  good knight, and for that and all thy other cruel murders have I slain  thee.'    With that arose a great outcry, and men ran from the tables towards Sir  Balin to slay him, and the foremost of them was King Pellam, who rushed  towards him, crying:    'Thou hast slain my brother when he bore no sword, and thou shalt  surely die.'    'Well,' said Balin, 'come and do it thyself.'    'I shall do it,' said Pellam, 'and no man shall touch thee but me, for  the love of my brother.'    Pellam snatched an axe from the hands of one standing by, and smote  eagerly at Balin; but Balin put his sword between his head and the  stroke, and the sword was struck from his hand.    Then, weaponless, Balin dashed through the circle of guests towards a  door, looking for a weapon while he ran, but none could he find. King  Pellam followed closely behind him, and so they ran from chamber to  chamber, and up the narrow stair within the wall, until at the last  Balin found that he was near the top of the tower, and thought that now  he must surely be slain, for no weapon had he found.    Suddenly he came upon a door, and bursting it open he found himself in  a large room marvellously bright and richly dight, and with a bed  arrayed with cloth of gold, and one old and white and reverend lying  therein. And by the side of the bed was a table of virgin gold on  pillars of pure silver, and on it stood a spear, strangely wrought.    Balin seized the spear, and turned upon King Pellam, who stood still in  the doorway with terror in his eyes. But, marking naught of this, Balin  thrust at him with the spear, and struck it in his side, and King  Pellam with a great cry fell to the ground.    With that stroke the walls of the castle drove together and fell in  ruins to the ground, and a great cry of lamentation beat to and fro  from far and near, and Balin lay under the stones as one dead.    After three days Merlin came and drew out Balin from the ruins, and  nourished and healed him. He also recovered his sword and got him a  good horse, for his own was slain. Then he bade him ride out of that  country without delay.    'And never more shall you have ease,' said Merlin. 'For by the stroke  of that spear with intent to slay King Pellam thou hast done such a  dolorous deed that not for many years shall its evil cease to work.'    'What have I done?' said Balin.    'Thou wouldst have slain a man with the very spear that Longius the  Roman thrust into the side of our Lord Jesus when He suffered on the  Rood; and by that thou hast defiled it, and caused such ill that never  shall its tale be ended until a stainless knight shall come, one of  those who shall achieve the Holy Graal.'    'It repents me,' said Balin heavily, 'but the adventure was forced upon  me.'    As he rode through the land, he saw how it seemed that a dire  pestilence had swept over it; for where he had seen the golden corn  waving in miles of smiling fields, he saw it now blackened along the  ground; the trees were stripped of their leaves and fruit, the cattle  lay dead in the meads, and the fish rotted in the streams, while in the  villages lay the people dead or dying in shattered or roofless  cottages.    As he passed, those that were alive cursed him, and called down upon  him the wrath of Heaven.    'See, see,' they cried, 'thou murderous knight, how the evil stroke  thou gavest to King Pellam by that hallowed spear hath destroyed this  happy land! Go! thou foul knight, and may the vengeance strike thee  soon!'    Balin went on, heavy of mind, for he knew not why he had been caused to  do this evil.    For many days he passed through the saddened land, and he felt that in  a little while death would meet him.    Then suddenly one day he came upon a castle in a wood, and he heard a  horn blow, as it had been at the death of a beast.    'Here,' said Balin, 'shall I meet my death-wound, for that blast was  blown for me.'    As he came on the green before the castle, many ladies and knights met  him and welcomed him with fair semblance, and gave him good cheer.    'Now,' said the lady of the castle, when he had eaten, 'ye must do a  joust for me with a knight hereby who hath won from me a fair island in  a stream, and he hath overcome every knight that hath essayed to win it  back for me.'    'Well, as you claim it for your good cheer,' said Balin, 'I will e'en  joust, though both I and my horse are spent with travelling, and my  heart is heavy. Nevertheless, show me the place.'    'But, sir,' said a knight, 'thou shouldst change thy shield for a  bigger. For the strange knight is a strong one and a hardy.'    Balin cared not, and so took the shield with a device upon it that was  not his own. Then he and his horse were led to a great barge, and so  they were poled across the wide stream to an island.    When Balin had landed and mounted his horse, he rode a little way  towards a stout tower, and from it a knight issued, his armour all in  red, and the trappings of his horse of the same colour. They couched  their lances and came marvellously fast together, and smote each other  in the midmost of their shields; and the shock of their spears was so  great that it bore down both horses and men, and for a little while the  knights were dazed.    The stranger rose up first, for Balin was much bruised and wearied; and  the red knight drew his sword and came towards Balin, who thereupon got  upon his feet, and they fought most fiercely together. So they fought  till their breaths failed.    Many were the bouts they fought, and they rested oftentimes, and then  to battle again, so that in a little while the grass of the sward where  they struggled was red with the blood of their wounds.    But the more wearied they were the fiercer they fought to vanquish each  the other, so that their hauberks were in tatters, their helms were  broken, and their shields were rived and cracked. At the last the red  knight could not lift his shield for weakness, and then he went back a  little and fell down.    Balin also sank to the ground, faint with his wounds, and as he lay he  cried out:    'What knight art thou? for ere now I never found a knight that matched  me.'    The other answered him faintly:    'My name is Balan, brother to the good knight Balin!'    'Alas!' said Balin, 'that ever I should see the day!' And therewith he  fell back in a swoon.    Then Balan crawled on all fours, feet and hands, and put off the helm  of his brother, and might hardly know him by his face, so hewn and  stained it was. Balan wept and kissed his face, and with that Balin  awoke.    'O Balan, my brother, thou hast slain me and I thee!'    'Alas!' said Balan, 'but I knew thee not, my brother. Hadst thou had  thine own shield, I would have known thy device of the two swords.'    'Ah, 'twas part of the evil hap that hath followed me,' cried Balin. 'I  know not why.'    Then they both swooned, and the lady of the castle came and would have  had them taken to a chamber. But Balan awoke and said:    'Let be! let be! No leech can mend us. And I would not live more, for I  have slain my dear brother and he me!'    Balin woke up therewith, and put his hand forth, and his brother  clasped it in his, very eagerly.    'Little brother,' said Balin, 'I cannot come to thee--kiss me!' When  they had kissed, they swooned again, and in a little while Balin died,  but Balan did not pass until midnight.    'Alas! alas!' cried the lady, weeping for very pity, 'that ever this  should be. Two brothers that have played together about their mother's  knees to slay each other unwittingly!'    On the morrow came Merlin, and made them be buried richly in the green  place where they had fought, and on their tomb he caused to be written  in letters of gold, deep and thick, these words: 'Here lie Sir Balin  and his brother Sir Balan, who, unwittingly, did most pitifully slay  each other: and this Sir Balin was, moreover, he that smote the  dolorous stroke. Whereof the end is not yet.'          III    HOW LANCELOT WAS MADE A KNIGHT. THE FOUR WITCH QUEENS, AND THE  ADVENTURES AT THE CHAPEL PERILOUS      When King Arthur was arrived at the age of twenty-five, his knights and  barons counselled that he should take a queen, and his choice fell upon  Gwenevere, the daughter of King Leodegrance, of the land of Cameliard.  This damsel was the most beautiful and the most gracious in all the  realm of Britain.    When the marriage was arranged between her father and Merlin, King  Leodegrance said that, for her dowry, instead of broad lands, of which  King Arthur had many, he would give to Arthur the Table Round, which  Uther Pendragon had in friendship given to him many years before. For,  as King Arthur was already famous for his prowess and nobleness and his  love of knightly men and brave deeds, Leodegrance knew that this would  be a gift beloved of Arthur.    With the table were to go the knights who were its company. It seated  one hundred and fifty when it was complete, but many had been slain,  and now they numbered but a hundred.    When King Arthur heard from Merlin of the coming of Gwenevere, with the  hundred knights bearing the Round Table with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#9)"],[1,"or       assigns, to enter or come into the premises, and there in       some one of the upper rooms to have such convenient place to       sit or stand to see such plays as shall be there played,       freely without anything therefor paying.[65]    [Footnote 63: One cannot be absolutely sure, yet the whole history of  early playhouses indicates that the Theatre was polygonal (or  circular) in shape. The only reason for suspecting that it might have  been square, doubtfully presented by T.S. Graves in \"The Shape of the  First London Theatre\" (_The South Atlantic Quarterly_, July, 1914),  seems to me to deserve no serious consideration.]    [Footnote 64: Quoted by W.B. Rye, _England as Seen by Foreigners_, p.  88.]    [Footnote 65: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 177.]    The stage was a platform, projecting into the yard, with a  tiring-house at the rear, and a balcony overhead. The details of the  stage, no doubt, were subject to alteration as experience suggested,  for its materials were of wood, and histrionic and dramatic art were  both undergoing rapid development.[66] The furnishings and  decorations, as in the case of modern playhouses, seem to have been  ornate. Thus T[homas] W[hite], in _A Sermon Preached at Pawles Crosse,  on Sunday the Thirde of November, 1577_, exclaims: \"Behold the  sumptuous Theatre houses, a continual monument of London's  prodigality\"; John Stockwood, in _A Sermon Preached at Paules Cross,  1578_, refers to it as \"the gorgeous playing place erected in the  Fields\"; and Gabriel Harvey could think of no more appropriate epithet  for it than \"painted\"--\"painted theatres,\" \"painted stage.\"    [Footnote 66: There is no reason whatever to suppose, with Ordish,  Mantzius, Lawrence, and others, that the stage of the Theatre was  removable; for although the building was frequently used by fencers,  tumblers, etc., it was never, so far as I can discover, used for  animal-baiting.]    The building was doubtless used for dramatic performances in the  autumn of 1576, although it was not completed until later; John  Grigges, one of the carpenters, deposed that Burbage and Brayne  \"finished the same with the help of the profits that grew by plays  used there before it was fully finished.\"[67] Access to the playhouse  was had chiefly by way of Finsbury Field and a passage made by Burbage  through the brick wall mentioned in the lease.[68]    [Footnote 67: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 135.]    [Footnote 68: For depositions to this effect see Halliwell-Phillipps,  _Outlines_, I, 350 ff.]    The terms under which the owners let it to the actors were simple: the  actors retained as their share the pennies paid at the outer doors for  general admission, and the proprietors received as their share the  money paid for seats or standings in the galleries.[69] Cuthbert  Burbage states in 1635: \"The players that lived in those first times  had only the profits arising from the doors, but now the players  receive all the comings in at the doors to themselves, and half the  galleries.\"[70]    [Footnote 69: I suspect that the same terms were made with the actors  by the proprietors of the inn-playhouses.]    [Footnote 70: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 317.]    Before the expiration of two years, or in the early summer of 1578,  Burbage and Brayne began to quarrel about the division of the money  which fell to their share. Brayne apparently thought that he should at  once be indemnified for all the money he had expended on the playhouse  in excess of Burbage; and he accused Burbage of \"indirect  dealing\"--there were even whispers of \"a secret key\" to the \"common  box\" in which the money was kept.[71] Finally they agreed to \"submit  themselves to the order and arbitrament of certain persons for the  pacification thereof,\" and together they went to the shop of a notary  public to sign a bond agreeing to abide by the decision of the  arbitrators. There they \"fell a reasoning together,\" in the course of  which Brayne asserted that he had disbursed in the Theatre \"three  times at the least as much more as the sum then disbursed by the said  James Burbage.\" In the end Brayne unwisely hinted at \"ill dealing\" on  the part of Burbage, whereupon \"Burbage did there strike him with his  fist, and so they went together by the ears, in so much,\" says the  notary, \"that this deponent could hardly part them.\" After they were  parted, they signed a bond of L200 to abide by the decision of the  arbitrators. The arbitrators, John Hill and Richard Turnor, \"men of  great honesty and credit,\" held their sessions \"in the Temple church,\"  whither they summoned witnesses. Finally, on July 12, 1578, after  \"having thoroughly heard\" both sides, they awarded that the profits  from the Theatre should be used first to pay the debts upon the  building, then to pay Brayne the money he had expended in excess of  Burbage, and thereafter to be shared \"in divident equally between  them.\"[72] These conditions, however, were not observed, and the  failure to observe them led to much subsequent discord.    [Footnote 71: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 142, 148.]    [Footnote 72: For the history of this quarrel, and for other details  of the award see Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 102, 119, 138, 142, 143,  148, 152.]    The arbitrators also decided that \"if occasion should move them  [Burbage and Brayne] to borrow any sum of money for the payment of  their debts owing for any necessary use and thing concerning the said  Theatre, that then the said James Burbage and the said John Brayne  should _join_ in pawning or mortgageing of their estate and interest  of and in the same.\"[73] An occasion for borrowing money soon arose.  So on September 26, 1579, the two partners mortgaged the Theatre to  John Hide for the sum of L125 8_s._ 11_d._ At the end of a year, by  non-payment, they forfeited the mortgage, and the legal title to the  property passed to Hide. It seems, however, that because of some  special clause in the mortgage Hide was unable to expel Burbage and  Brayne, or to dispose of the property to others. Hence he took no  steps to seize the Theatre; but he constantly annoyed the occupants by  arrest and otherwise. This unfortunate transference of the title to  Hide was the cause of serious quarreling between the Burbages and the  Braynes, and finally led to much litigation.    [Footnote 73: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 103.]    In 1582 a more immediate disaster threatened the owners of the  Theatre. One Edmund Peckham laid claim to the land on which the  playhouse had been built, and brought suit against Alleyn for  recovery. More than that, Peckham tried to take actual possession of  the playhouse, so that Burbage \"was fain to find men at his own charge  to keep the possession thereof from the said Peckham and his  servants,\" and was even \"once in danger of his own life by keeping  possession thereof.\" As a result of this state of affairs, Burbage  \"was much disturbed and troubled in his possession of the Theatre, and  could not quietly and peaceably enjoy the same. And therefore the  players forsook the said Theatre, to his great loss.\"[74] In order to  reimburse himself in some measure for this loss Burbage retained L30  of the rental due to Alleyn. The act led to a bitter quarrel with  Alleyn, and figured conspicuously in the subsequent litigation that  came near overwhelming the Theatre.    [Footnote 74: See Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 201, 239, 240, 242.]    In 1585 Burbage, having spent the stipulated L200 in repairing and  rebuilding the tenements on the premises, sought to renew the lease,  according to the original agreement, for the extended period of  twenty-one years. On November 20, 1585, he engaged three skilled  workmen to view the buildings and estimate the sum he had disbursed in  improvements. They signed a formal statement to the effect that in  their opinion at least L220 had been thus expended on the premises.  Burbage then \"tendered unto the said Alleyn a new lease devised by his  counsel, ready written and engrossed, with labels and wax thereunto  affixed, agreeable to the covenant.\" But Alleyn refused to sign the  document. He maintained that the new lease was not a verbatim copy of  the old lease, that L200 had not been expended on the buildings, and  that Burbage was a bad tenant and owed him rent. In reality, Alleyn  wanted to extort a larger rental than L14 for the property, which had  greatly increased in value.    On July 18, 1586, Burbage engaged six men, all expert laborers, to  view the buildings again and estimate the cost of the improvements.  They expressed the opinion in writing that Burbage had expended at  least L240 in developing the property.[75] Still Alleyn refused to  sign an extension of the lease. His conduct must have been very  exasperating to the owner of the Theatre. Cuthbert Burbage tells us  that his father \"did often in gentle manner solicit and require the  said Gyles Alleyn for making a new lease of the said premises  according to the purporte and effect of the said covenant.\" But  invariably Alleyn found some excuse for delay.    [Footnote 75: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 229, 234, 228, 233.]    The death of Brayne, in August, 1586, led John Hide, who by reason of  the defaulted mortgage was legally the owner of the Theatre, to  redouble his efforts to collect his debt. He \"gave it out in speech  that he had set over and assigned the said lease and bonds to one  George Clough, his ... father-in-law (but in truth he did not so),\"  and \"the said Clough, his father-in-law, did go about to put the said  defendant [Burbage] out of the Theatre, or at least did threaten to  put him out.\" As we have seen, there was a clause in the mortgage  which prevented Hide from ejecting Burbage;[76] yet Clough was able to  make so much trouble, \"divers and sundry times\" visiting the Theatre,  that at last Burbage undertook to settle the debt out of the profits  of the playhouse.
