Many of them had one or two little  ones--the most amusing, indefatigable little creatures imaginable--who  were incessantly running up small trees, jumping down again, and  performing all sorts of antics, till one felt quite wearied with their  perpetual activity. When the mother wished to fly, she clutched the  little one under her arm, where, clinging round her body with all its  arms, it remained in safety, while she made leaps of from thirty to  forty feet, and ran at a most astonishing rate down the khad, catching  at any tree or twig that offered itself to any one of her four arms.  There were two old grave apes of enormous size sitting together on the  branch of a tree, and deliberately catching the fleas in each other's  shaggy coats. The patient sat perfectly still, while his brother ape  divided and thoroughly searched his beard and hair, lifted up one arm  and then the other, and turned him round as he thought fit; and then the  patient undertook to perform the same office for his friend.\"      THE AYE-AYE (_Chiromys Madagascariensis_).    Zoologists used to know a very curious animal from Madagascar, by name,  or by an indifferent specimen preserved in the Paris Museum. Sonnerat,  the naturalist, obtained it from that great island so well known to  geographical boys in former days by its being, so they were told, the  largest island in the world. This strange quadruped was named by a word  which meant \"handed-mouse,\" for such is the signification of _chiromys_,  or _cheiromys_, as it used to be spelled. This creature, when its  history was better known, was believed to be not far removed in the  system from the lemurs and loris. Its soft fur, long tail, large eyes,  and other features and habits connected it with these quadrumana, while  its rodent dentition seemed to refer it to the group containing our  squirrels, hares, and mice. It has been the subject of a profound memoir  by Professor Owen, our greatest comparative anatomist; and I remember,  with pleasure, the last time I saw him at the Museum he was engaged in  its dissection. I may here refer to one of the Professor's lighter  productions--a lecture at Exeter Hall on some instances of the \"power of  God as manifested in His animal creation\"--for a very nice notice of  this curious quadruped. In one of the French journals, there was an  excellent account given of the peculiar habits of the little nocturnal  creature. In those tropical countries the trees are tenanted by  countless varieties of created things. Their wood affords rich feeding  to the large, fat, pulpy grubs of beetles of the families _Buprestidae_,  _Dynastidae_, _Passalidae_, and, above all, that glorious group the  _Longicornia_. These beetles worm their way into the wood, making often  long tunnels, feeding as they work, and leaving their _ejecta_ in the  shape of agglomerated sawdust. It is into the long holes drilled by  these beetles that the Aye-Aye searches with his long fingers, one of  which, on the fore-hand, is specially thin, slender, and skeleton-like.  It looks like the tool of some lock-picker. Our large-eyed little  friend, like the burglar, comes out at night and finds these holes on  the trees where he slept during the day. His sensitive thin ears, made  to hear every scratch, can detect the rasping of the retired grub,  feasting in apparent security below. Naturalists sometimes hear at  night, so Samouelle once told me, the grubs of moths munching the dewy  leaves. Our aye-aye is no collector, but he has eyes, ears, and fingers  too, that see, hear, and get larvae that, when grown and changed into  beetles, are the valued prizes of entomologists. Into that tunnelled  hole he inserts his long finger, and squash it goes into a large, pulpy,  fat, sweet grub. It takes but a moment to draw it out; and if it be a  pupa near the bark, so much the better for the aye-aye, so much the  worse for the beetle or cossus. I might dilate on this subject, but  prefer referring the reader to Professor Owen's memoir, and to his  lecture.[22] The aye-aye, in every point of its structure, like every  created thing, is full of design. Its curious fingers, especially the  skeleton-like chopstick of a digit referred to, attract especial notice,  from their evident adaptation to the condition of its situation and  existence, as one of the works of an omnipotent and beneficent Creator.

A highly curious, if not the strangest, order of the class are these  flying creatures called bats. It is evident from Noel Paton's fairy  pictures that he has closely studied their often fantastic faces. The  writer could commend to his attention an African bat, lately figured by  his friend Mr Murray.[23] Its enormous head, or rather muzzle, compared  with its other parts, gives it an outrageously hideous look. In the late  excellent Dr Horsfield's work on the animals of Java, there are some  engravings of bats by Mr Taylor, who acquired among engravers the title  of \"Bat Taylor,\" so wonderfully has he rendered the exquisite pileage or  fur of these creatures. It is wonderful how numerous the researches of  naturalists, such as Mr Tomes, of Welford, near Stratford, have shown  the order _Cheiroptera_ to be in genera and species. Their profiles and  full faces, even in outline, are often most bizarre and strange. Their  interfemoral membranes, we may add, are actual \"unreticulated\" nets,  with which they catch and detain flies as they skim through the air.  They pick these out of this bag with their mouths, and \"make no bones\"  of any prey, so sharp and pointed are their pretty insectivorous teeth.  Their flying membranes, stretched on the elongated finger-bones of their  fore-legs, are wonderful adaptations of Divine wisdom, a capital subject  for the natural theologian to select.    Our poet-laureate must be a close observer of natural history. In his  \"In Memoriam,\" xciv., he distinctly alludes to some very curious West  African bats first described by the late amiable Edward T. Bennett, long  the much-valued secretary of the Zoological Society. These bats are  closely related to the fox bats, and form a genus which is named, from  their shoulder and breast appendages, _Epomophorus_:--       \"Bats went round in fragrant skies,     And wheel'd or lit the filmy shapes     That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes,     And woolly breasts and beaded eyes.\"    The species Mr Bennett named _E. Whitei_, after the good Rev. Gilbert  White, that well-known worthy who wrote \"The Natural History of  Selborne,\" wherein are many notices of bats.      CAPTAIN COOK'S SAILOR AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF A FOX-BAT.    It is curious, now that Australia is almost as civilised, and in parts  nearly as populous, as much of Europe, to read \"Lieutenant Cook's Voyage  Round the World,\" in vol. iii. of Hawkesworth's quartos, detailing the  discoveries of June, July, and August 1770--that is close upon a  century ago. What progress has the world made since that period! We do  not require long periods of ages to alter, to adapt, to develop the  customs and knowledge of man. At p. 156 we get an account of a large  bat. On the 23d June 1770 Cook says:--\"This day almost everybody had  seen the animal which the pigeon-shooters had brought an account of the  day before; and one of the seamen, who had been rambling in the woods,  told us, at his return, that he verily believed he had seen the devil.  We naturally inquired in what form he had appeared, and his answer was  in so singular a style that I shall set down his own words. 'He was,'  says John, 'as large as a one-gallon keg, and very like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25973"],[0,"Birds of the Rockies (#9)"],[1,"suits, modestly decorated with a rust-colored patch on the  back.    It was now far past noon, and beginning to feel weak with hunger, I  reluctantly said adieu to the junco and her brood, and hurried on to the  Halfway House, where a luncheon of sandwiches, pie and coffee  strengthened me for the remainder of my tramp down the mountain to  Manitou. That was a walk which lingers like a Greek legend in my memory  on account of--well, that is the story that remains to be told.    On a former visit to the Halfway House I was mentally knocked off my  feet by several glimpses of a woodpecker which was entirely new to me,  and of whose existence I was not even aware until this gorgeous  gentleman hove in sight. He was the handsomest member of the _Picidae_  family I have ever seen--his upper parts glossy black, some portions  showing a bluish iridescence; his belly rich sulphur yellow, a bright  red median stripe on the throat, set in the midst of the black, looking  like a small necktie; two white stripes running along the side of the  head, and a large white patch covering the middle and greater  wing-coverts. Altogether, an odd livery for a woodpecker. Silently he  swung from bole to bole for a few minutes, and then disappeared.    Not until I reached my room in Manitou could I fix the bird's place in  the avicular system. By consulting Coues's _Key_ and Professor Cooke's  brochure on the _Birds of Colorado_, I found this quaintly costumed  woodpecker to be Williamson's sapsucker (_Sphyrapicus thyroideus_),  known only in the western part of the United States from the Rocky  Mountains to the Pacific coast. I now lingered in the beautiful pine  grove surrounding the Halfway House, hoping to see him again, but he did  not appear, and I reluctantly started down the cog-wheel track.    As I was turning a bend in the road, I caught sight of a mountain  chickadee flitting to a dead snag on the slope at the right, the next  moment slipping into a small hole leading inside. I climbed up to the  shelf, a small level nook among the tall pines on the mountain side, to  inspect her retreat, for it was the first nest of this interesting  species that I found. The chickadee flashed in and out of the orifice,  carrying food to her little ones, surreptitiously executing her  housewifely duties. The mountain tit seems to be a shy and quiet little  body when compared with the common black-cap known in the East.    While watching this bird from my place of concealment, I became  conscious of the half-suppressed chirping of a woodpecker, and, to my  intense joy, a moment later a Williamson's sapsucker swung to a pine  bole a little below me and began pecking leisurely and with assumed  nonchalance for grubs in the fissures of the bark. From my hiding-place  behind some bushes I kept my eye on the handsome creature. An artist  might well covet the privilege of painting this elegant bird as he  scales the wall of a pine tree. Presently he glided to a snag not more  than a rod from the chickadee's domicile, and then I noticed that the  dead bole was perforated by a number of woodpecker holes, into one of  which the sapsucker presently slipped with the tidbit he held in his  bill. The doorway was almost too small for him, obliging him to turn  slightly sidewise and make some effort to effect an entrance. Fortune  had treated me as one of her favorites: I had discovered the nest of  Williamson's sapsucker.    But still another surprise was in store. A low, dubious chirping was  heard, and then the female ambled leisurely to the snag and hitched up  to the orifice. She made several efforts to enter, but could not while  her spouse was within. Presently he wormed himself out, whereupon she  went in, and remained for some time. At length I crept to the snag and  beat against it with my cane. She was loath to leave the nest, but after  a little while decided that discretion was the better part of valor.  When she came out, my presence so near her nursery caused her not a  little agitation, which she displayed by flinging about from bole to  bole and uttering a nervous chirp.    As to costume, the male and the female had little in common. Her back  was picturesquely mottled and barred with black and white, her head  light brown, her breast decorated with a large black patch, and her  other under parts yellow. Had the couple not been seen together flitting  about the nest, they would not have been regarded as mates, so  differently were they habited.    Standing before the doorway of the nursery--it was not quite so high as  my head--I could plainly hear the chirping of the youngsters within.  Much as I coveted the sight of a brood of this rare species, I could not  bring myself to break down the walls of their cottage and thus expose  them to the claws and beaks of their foes. Even scientific curiosity  must be restrained by considerations of mercy.    The liege lord of the family had now disappeared. Desirous of seeing him  once more, I hid myself in a bush-clump near at hand and awaited his  return. Presently he came ambling along and scrambled into the orifice,  turning his body sidewise, as he had done before. I made my way quietly  to the snag and tapped upon it with my cane, but he did not come out, as  I expected him to do. Then I struck the snag more vigorously. No result.  Then I whacked the bole directly in the rear of the nest, while I stood  close at one side watching the doorway. The bird came to the orifice,  peeped out, then, seeing me, quickly drew back, determined not to desert  his brood in what he must have regarded as an emergency. In spite of all  my pounding and coaxing and feigned scolding--and I kept up the racket  for several minutes--I did not succeed in driving the _pater familias_  from his post of duty. Once he apparently made a slight effort to  escape, but evidently stuck fast in the entrance, and so dropped back  and would not leave, only springing up to the door and peeping out at me  when my appeals became especially vigorous. It appeared like a genuine  case of \"I'm determined to defend my children, or die in the attempt!\"    Meanwhile the mother bird was flitting about in an agitated way,  uttering piteous cries of remonstrance and entreaty. Did that bandit  intend to rob her of both her husband and her children? It was useless,  if not wanton, to hector the poor creatures any longer, even to study  their behavior under trying circumstances; and I left them in peace, and  hurried down to my lodgings in Manitou, satisfied with the results of my  day's ramble.          BIRDS OF THE ARID PLAIN    [Illustration: PLATE III    LAZULI BUNTING--_Cyanospiza amoena_  (Upper figure, male; lower, female)]      Having explored the summit of Pike's Peak and part of its southern slope  down to the timber-line, and spent several delightful days in the upper  valleys of the mountains, as well as in exploring several canyons, the  rambler was desirous of knowing what species of birds reside on the  plain stretching eastward from the bases of the towering ranges. One  afternoon in the latter part of June, I found myself in a straggling  village about forty miles east of Colorado Springs.    On looking around, I was discouraged, and almost wished I had not come;  for all about me extended the parched and treeless plain, with only here  and there a spot that had a cast of verdure, and even that was of a dull  and sickly hue. Far off to the northeast rose a range of low hills  sparsely covered with scraggy pines, but they were at least ten miles  away, perhaps twenty, and had almost as arid an aspect as that of the  plains themselves. Only one small cluster of deciduous trees was  visible, about a mile up a shallow valley or \"draw.\" Surely this was a  most unpromising field for bird study. If I had only been content to  remain among the mountains, where, even though the climbing was  difficult, there were brawling brooks, shady woodlands, and green, copsy  vales in which many feathered friends had lurked!    [Illustration: _Desert Horned Larks_    \"_They were plentiful in this parched region_\"]    But wherever the bird-lover chances to be, his mania leads him to look  for his favorites, and he is seldom disappointed; rather, he is often  delightfully surprised. People were able to make a livelihood here, as  was proved by the presence of the village and a few scattering dwellings  on the plain; then why not the birds, which are as thrifty and wise in  many ways as their human relatives? In a short time my baggage was  stowed in a safe place, and, field-glass in hand, I sallied forth for my  first jaunt on a Colorado plain. But, hold! what were these active  little birds, hopping about on the street and sipping from the pool by  the village well? They were the desert horned larks, so called because  they select the dry plains of the West as their dwelling place. They are  interesting birds. The fewer trees and the less humidity, provided  there is a spot not too far away at which they may quench their thirst  and rinse their feathers, the better they seem to be pleased. They were  plentiful in this parched region, running or flying cheerfully before me  wherever my steps were bent. I could not help wondering how many  thousands of them--and millions, perhaps--had taken up free homesteads  on the seemingly limitless plains of eastern Colorado.    Most of the young had already left the nest, and were flying about in  the company of their elders, learning the fine art of making a living  for themselves and evading the many dangers to which bird flesh is heir.  The youngsters could readily be distinguished from their seniors by the  absence of distinct black markings on throat, chest, and forehead, and  the lighter cast of their entire plumage.    Sometimes these birds are called shore larks; but that is evidently a  misnomer, or at least a very inapt name, for they are not in the least  partial to the sea-shore or even the shores"]]]
