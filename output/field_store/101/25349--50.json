As the hermitage could not be seen from the caravel, not being aware of  what had taken place, the Admiral feared that his boat had been wrecked,  and accordingly, weighing anchor, he stood in a direction to command a  view of the chapel.    He now caught sight of a number of armed horsemen, who, dismounting,  entered the boat, and came towards the caravel.  He accordingly got  ready to give them a warm reception, but they approached in a pacific  manner, and Castaneda himself, who was in the boat, asked leave to come  on board.    Columbus reproached him for his perfidy, to which he replied that he was  only acting in accordance with the orders of his sovereigns, so that  Columbus began to fear that a war had broken out between the two  countries during his absence.  He had no time to ascertain the truth  before another heavy gale coming on, he was driven from his anchorage,  and compelled to stand out to sea.    For two days the vessel remained in the greatest peril, short-handed as  she was, being unable to return to her anchorage at Saint Mary's.    As soon as she dropped anchor, a notary and two priests came off  demanding to see his papers on the part of Castaneda, who had sent them  to assure him that if it should be found that he really sailed in the  service of the Spanish sovereigns, he would render him every assistance  in his power.    The notary and priest were satisfied with his letters of commission, and  the following morning the boat and seamen were sent back.  From the  latter Columbus learnt the cause of Castaneda's conduct.  The  inhabitants had told them that the King of Portugal, jealous lest his  expedition should interfere with his discoveries in India, had directed  his governors of islands and distant ports to seize and detain him  wherever he should be met with.    Having been detained two days longer at Saint Mary's in an endeavour to  take in wood and ballast, but being prevented by the heavy surf which  broke upon the shore, he set sail on the 24th of February.  After a fine  run of two days the weather again became tempestuous, and there appeared  every probability of the ship foundering.    On the 3rd of March land was descried, and it was with the greatest  difficulty that the ship could be kept off the shore.  At daylight on  the 4th the voyagers found themselves off the rock of Cintra, a few  miles from Lisbon.  Rather than risk another night at sea, Columbus  determined to hazard the chance of falling into the hands of the  Portuguese.  The ship was accordingly steered in and brought up opposite  Rastello, at the mouth of the river Tagus.    The oldest mariners who came off assured Columbus that they had never  known so temptestuous a winter, and had been watching his vessel with  the greatest anxiety since she had first been seen.  He immediately  dispatched a courier to the King and Queen of Spain with the tidings of  his discovery, and requested permission of the King of Portugal to go up  to Lisbon, fearing that the inhabitants of Rastello, when they heard of  her rich freight, might be tempted to rob her.    The King of Portugal, who was some distance from the capital, at once  invited Columbus to visit him.  During the interview which ensued he  endeavoured to conceal his vexation at having refused the proposals  which had been made him by the navigator.    His Court tried to persuade him that Columbus had visited countries over  which, according to the Pope's bull, he had the right to rule.  Some had  the baseness to hint that Columbus should be assassinated, and suggested  that he should be embroiled in a quarrel, during which the project might  be accomplished.    The King, happily, had too much magnanimity to agree to so nefarious a  measure.  He treated Columbus with the greatest courtesy, and a large  party of cavaliers escorted him back to his ship.    By the time Columbus reached her the weather had moderated, and, again  setting sail, on the 15th of March, A.D. 1493, he entered the port of  Palos, whence he had sailed on the 3rd of August of the preceding year,  having taken not quite seven months and a half to accomplish this  momentous maritime enterprise.    The enthusiastic reception he met with from the inhabitants of Palos can  be imagined.  They had given him and his companions up for lost.  Bells  were rung and the shops shut; all business was suspended; and the  inhabitants came thronging to the ship to ascertain the fate of their  friends.  On landing, he went to the principal church, accompanied by a  concourse of people, to return thanks to God for the accomplishment of  his enterprise.    As the Court was at Barcelona, he felt inclined to go there in his  caravel, but, considering her condition, he finally resolved to proceed  by land.  That very evening, while the bells were sending forth their  peals of triumph, the _Pinta_, commanded by Martin Alonzo Pinzon,  entered the river.    Pinzon had been driven by the gale into the Bay of Biscay, and had  reached the port of Bayonne.  Fancying that Columbus had perished, he  had written to the sovereigns claiming credit to himself for the  accomplishment of the undertaking.  On hearing that Columbus had arrived  before him, his heart sank within him.  He made his way unobserved to  his own house, and, on receiving a reproachful letter from Ferdinand and  Isabella, he took to his bed, and in a short time died of deep chagrin  on seeing Columbus receive all the honours he had himself hoped to  obtain.    Columbus, having performed the journey to Barcelona in safety, was  received with the greatest possible respect by Ferdinand and Isabella,  whose nobles and courtiers vied with each other in endeavouring to do  him honour.  His entrance into the city was like a Roman triumph.  The  courtiers and hidalgos, and a vast concourse of people, came forth to  meet him.  Before him were paraded the Indians, decked out according to  their savage fashion, and after these were borne various kinds of live  parrots, stuffed birds and animals, and rare plants; while there was a  conspicuous display of Indian coronets, bracelets, and other decorations  of gold.    Columbus followed on horseback, accompanied by a brilliant cavalcade of  Spanish chivalry.  The windows and balconies were crowded with the fair;  the very roofs were covered with spectators.    The King and the kind Queen awaited his arrival seated on a throne, in a  vast and splendid saloon, under a rich canopy of brocade of gold.  They  raised him as he attempted to kneel, and had a seat placed for him near  them,--a rare honour in so punctilious a Court.  He here narrated his  adventures, to which they listened with wrapt attention; and, when he  retired from the royal presence, he was attended by the whole Court to  his residence.    Ferdinand and Isabella setting the example for many days, all the nobles  of the land exerted themselves to do him honour.  He modestly received  all the attentions paid to him.  Though his mind was teeming with  magnificent schemes for the future, he did not forget that for the  deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre, and believing that ere long vast  wealth would accrue to him, he made a vow to furnish, within seven  years, an army of four thousand horse and fifty thousand foot, for the  rescue of the Holy Sepulchre, and a similar force within the five  following years.    Not only Spain, but all the civilised nations of the earth rejoiced at  the important discovery achieved by Columbus.  In England especially it  excited that spirit of discovery which was ere long to add so greatly to  her wealth and renown.    During his sojourn at Barcelona the sovereigns took every occasion to  bestow on Columbus personal marks of their high consideration.  Frequently the King appeared on horseback, with Prince Juan on one side  and Columbus on the other.    To perpetuate in his family the glory of his achievement, a coat of arms  was assigned him, in which the royal arms--the castle and lion--were  quartered with his proper bearings, which were a group of islands  surrounded by waves.  To these arms were added the words--    \"A Castella y a Leon Nuevo Mundo dio Colon.\"    \"To Castile and Leon Columbus gave a new world.\"        CHAPTER FOUR.

Lycurgus, having thus obtained possession of the babe, carried him to  the council hall. There the child was named king; and Lycurgus promised  that he would watch carefully over him, educate him well, and rule for  him until he should be old and wise enough to reign alone.    While he was thus acting as ruler, Lycurgus made use of his power to  bring many new customs into Sparta, and to change the laws. As he was  one of the wisest men who ever lived, he knew very well that men must be  good if they would be happy. He also knew that health is far better than  riches; and, hoping to make the Spartans both good and healthy, he won  them over little by little to obey a new set of laws, which he had made  after visiting many of the neighboring countries, and learning all he  could.          XXII. THE SPARTAN TRAINING.      The laws which Lycurgus drew up for the Spartans were very strict. For  instance, as soon as a babe came into the world, the law ordered that  the father should wrap it up in a cloak, and carry it before a council  made up of some of the oldest and wisest men.    They looked at the child carefully, and if it seemed strong and healthy,  and was neither crippled nor in any way deformed, they said that it  might live. Then they gave it back to the father, and bade him bring up  the child for the honor of his country.    If the babe was sickly or deformed, it was carried off to a mountain  near by, and left alone; so that it soon died of hunger or thirst, or  was eaten up by the wild beasts.    The Spartan children staid under their father's roof and in their  mother's care until they were seven years old. While in the nursery,  they were taught all the beautiful old Greek legends, and listened with  delight to the stories of the ancient heroes, and especially to the  poems of Homer telling about the war of Troy and the adventures of  Ulysses.    As soon as the children had reached seven years of age, they were given  over to the care of the state, and allowed to visit their parents but  seldom. The boys were put in charge of chosen men, who trained them to  become strong and brave; while the girls were placed under some good and  wise woman, who not only taught them all they needed to know to keep  house well, but also trained them to be as strong and fearless as their  brothers. All Spartan boys were allowed but one rough woolen garment,  which served as their sole covering by night and by day, and was of the  same material in summer as in winter.    They were taught very little reading, writing, and arithmetic, but were  carefully trained to recite the poems of Homer, the patriotic songs, and  to accompany themselves skillfully on the lyre. They were also obliged  to sing in the public chorus, and to dance gracefully at all the  religious feasts.    As the Spartans were very anxious that their boys should be strong and  fearless, they were taught to stand pain and fatigue without a murmur;  and, to make sure that they could do so, their teachers made them go  through a very severe training.    Led by one of the older boys, the little lads were often sent out for  long tramps over rough and stony roads, under the hot sun; and the best  boy was the one who kept up longest, in spite of bleeding feet, burning  thirst, and great fatigue.    Spartan boys were allowed no beds to sleep in, lest they should become  lazy and hard to please. Their only couch was a heap of rushes, which  they picked on the banks of the Eu-ro'tas, a river near Sparta; and in  winter they were allowed to cover these with a layer of cat-tail down to  make them softer and warmer.          XXIII. THE BRAVE SPARTAN BOY.      As greedy and disobedient children were viewed at Sparta with the  contempt they deserved, all the boys were trained to obey at a word,  whatever the order given, and were allowed only the plainest and  scantiest food.    Strange to relate, the Spartans also trained their boys to steal. They  praised them when they succeeded in doing so without being found out,  and punished them only when caught in the act. The reason for this queer  custom was this: the people were often engaged in war, and as they had  no baggage wagons following their army, and no special officer to  furnish food, they had to depend entirely upon the provisions they could  get on their way.    Whenever an army came in sight, the people hid not only their wealth,  but also their food; and, had not the Spartan soldiers been trained to  steal, they would often have suffered much from hunger when they were at  war.    To test the courage of the Spartan boys, their teachers never allowed  them to have a light, and often sent them out alone in the middle of the  night, on errands which they had to do as best they could.    Then, too, once a year all the boys were brought to the Temple of Diana,  where their courage was further tried by a severe flogging; and those  who stood this whipping without a tear or moan were duly praised. The  little Spartan boys were so eager to be thought brave, that it is said  that some let themselves be flogged to death rather than complain.    The bravery of one of these boys was so wonderful that you will find it  mentioned in nearly every Greek history you read. This little fellow had  stolen a live fox, and hidden it in the bosom of his dress, on his way  to school.    The imprisoned fox, hoping to escape, began to gnaw a hole in the boy's  chest, and to tear his flesh with his sharp claws; but, in spite of the  pain, the lad sat still, and let the fox bite him to death.    It was only when he fell lifeless to the floor that the teachers found  the fox, and saw how cruelly he had torn the brave little boy to pieces.  Ever since then, when boys stand pain bravely and without wincing, they  have been called little Spartans, in memory of this lad.    In order that the boys should be taught to behave well under all  circumstances, they were never allowed to speak except when spoken to,  and then their answers were expected to be as short and exact as  possible.    This style of speaking, where much was said in few words, was so usual  in the whole country of Laconia, that it is still known as the laconic  style.    To train them in this mode of speech, the elders daily made the boys  pass an oral examination, asking them any questions they could think of.  The boys had to answer promptly, briefly, and carefully; and if they  failed to do so, it was considered a great disgrace.    These daily questionings were meant to sharpen their wits, strengthen  their memories, and teach them how to think and decide quickly and  correctly.    The Spartan youths were further taught to treat all their elders with  the greatest respect; and it must have been a pretty sight to see all  these manly fellows respectfully saluting all the old people they met,  and even stopping their play to make way for them when they came on the  street.    To strengthen their muscles, the boys were also carefully trained in  gymnastics. They could handle weapons, throw heavy weights, wrestle, run  with great speed, swim, jump, and ride, and were experts in all  exercises which tended to make them strong, active, and well.          XXIV. PUBLIC TABLES IN SPARTA.      The Spartan men prided themselves upon living almost as plainly as the  boys, and, instead of eating their meals at home with the women and  children, they had a common table. Each man gave a certain amount of  flour, oil, wine, vegetables, and money, just enough to provide for his  share of food.    Instead of having varied and delicate dishes, they always ate about the  same things; and their favorite food was a thick dark stew or soup,  which they called black broth. Rich and poor were treated alike, sat  side by side, and ate the same food, which was intended to make them  equally strong and able to serve their country.    The girls and women never came to these public tables; but the boys were  given a seat there as soon as they had learned their first and most  important lesson, obedience.    When the boys came into the public dining hall for the first time, the  oldest man present called them to him, and, pointing to the door,  solemnly warned them that nothing said inside the walls was ever to be  repeated without.    Then, while the boys took their places and ate without speaking a word,  the old men talked freely of all they pleased, sure that Spartan lads  would never be mean enough to repeat anything they said, and trusting to  their honor.    Although the Spartans had wine upon their table, they were a very  temperate people, and drank only a very little with each meal. To show  the boys what a horrible thing drunkenness is, and the sure result of  too much drinking, the old men sometimes gave them an object lesson.    They sent for one of the meanest Helots or slaves, and purposely gave  him plenty of wine. He was encouraged to go on drinking until he sank on  the floor in a drunken sleep. Then the old men would point him out to  the boys, and explain to them that a man who has drunk too much is  unworthy of the love or esteem of his fellow-creatures, and is in many  ways worse than a beast.    The Spartan boys, thus early warned of the evils of drinking, were  careful to take but very little wine, and to keep their heads quite  clear, so that they might always be considered men, and might never  disgrace themselves as they had seen the Helots do.    When the boys had passed through the first course of training, they in  turn became the teachers and leaders of the smaller lads, and thus  served their country until they were old enough to go to war. When they  left for their first campaign, all the people came out to see them off,  and each mother gave her son his shield, saying,--    \"Come back with it or on it.\"    By this she meant \"Come home honorably, bearing your shield, thus  showing that you have never"]]]
