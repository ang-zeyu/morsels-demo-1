Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual  reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports  on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.  The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation  on which the other two are constructed; current intelligence  continually updates the  inventory of knowledge; and estimative  intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue  prospects for guidance of basic and  current intelligence. The World  Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National Intelligence  Estimates are examples of the three types of finished intelligence.    The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since  the days of George Washington but only since World War II have they  been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs have  highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since  that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The World Factbook.    During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home  to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for  integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed and  coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as  Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest. In  the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch  amphibious operations against many islands about which information was  unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the  United States should never again be caught unprepared.    In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of Naval  Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the  Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort should  be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that  recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing  Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy  Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental  basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government  for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic  intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34  JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous  letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.  Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,  \"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based  planners.\"    The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar world  was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on  national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret  Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world  leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than in  war. \"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities  - not just the enemy and his war production.\"    The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and  officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October  1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational  responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security  Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a peacetime  replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country  sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more  comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic  Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced  the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.    The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the  structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955  that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication  which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all  areas of the world.  There will always be a continuing requirement for  keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The Factbook was created as an annual  summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS studies. The first  classified Factbook was published in August 1962, and the first  unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program was  terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer  components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the  public with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The  1996 edition was printed by GPO, and the 1997 edition was reprinted by  GPO.  The year 2001 marks the 54th anniversary of the establishment of  the Central Intelligence Agency and the 58th year of continuous basic  intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and its  two predecessor programs.        =====================================================================        Contributors and Copyright Information      In general, information available as of 1 January 2001 was used in the  preparation of this edition.

The USSR was forced to withdraw 10 years later by  anti-communist mujahidin forces supplied and trained by the US,  Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others. Fighting subsequently continued  among the various mujahidin factions, but the fundamentalist Islamic  Taliban movement has been able to seize most of the country. In  addition to the continuing civil strife, the country suffers from  enormous poverty, a crumbling infrastructure, and widespread land  mines.

Output growth has averaged    about 7% in recent years, mainly as a result of boom in tourism    thanks to economic expansion in North America and the UK. The    economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in    late 1995 due to the effects of Hurricane Luis in September.    Agricultural output had only just begun to recover from a drought in    1994 when Luis hit. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort    into developing the offshore financing sector. A comprehensive    package of financial services legislation was enacted in late 1994.    In the medium term, prospects for the economy will depend on the    tourism sector and, therefore, on continuing income growth in the    industrialized nations.
