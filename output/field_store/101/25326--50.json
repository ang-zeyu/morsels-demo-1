Lord  Brougham's definition{90}. Origin partly habit, but the amount  necessarily unknown, partly selection. Young pointers pointing stones  and sheep--tumbling pigeons--sheep{91} going back to place where born.  Instinct aided by reason, as in the taylor-bird{92}. Taught by parents,  cows choosing food, birds singing. Instincts vary in wild state (birds  get wilder) often lost{93}; more perfect,--nest without roof. These  facts [only clear way] show how incomprehensibly brain has power of  transmitting intellectual operations.         {88} The same proviso occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 207, vi. p.       319.         {89} The tameness of the birds in the Galapagos is described in the       _Journal of Researches_ (1860), p. 398. Dogs and rabbits are       probably mentioned as cases in which the hereditary fear of man has       been lost. In the 1844 MS. the author states that the Cuban feral       dog shows great natural wildness, even when caught quite young.         {90} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 207, vi. p. 319, he refuses to       define instinct. For Lord Brougham's definition see his       _Dissertations on Subjects of Science etc._, 1839, p. 27.         {91} See James Hogg (the Ettrick Shepherd), Works, 1865, _Tales and       Sketches_, p. 403.         {92} This refers to the tailor-bird making use of manufactured       thread supplied to it, instead of thread twisted by itself.         {93} _Often lost_ applies to _instinct_: _birds get wilder_ is       printed in a parenthesis because it was apparently added as an       after-thought. _Nest without roof_ refers to the water-ousel       omitting to vault its nest when building in a protected situation.    Faculties{94} distinct from true instincts,--finding [way]. It must I  think be admitted that habits whether congenital or acquired by practice  [sometimes] often become inherited{95}; instincts, influence, equally  with structure, the preservation of animals; therefore selection must,  with changing conditions tend to modify the inherited habits of animals.  If this be admitted it will be found _possible_ that many of the  strangest instincts may be thus acquired. I may observe, without  attempting definition, that an inherited habit or trick (trick because  may be born) fulfils closely what we mean by instinct. A habit is often  performed unconsciously, the strangest habits become associated, d^o.  tricks, going in certain spots &c. &c., even against will, is excited by  external agencies, and looks not to the end,--a person playing a  pianoforte. If such a habit were transmitted it would make a marvellous  instinct. Let us consider some of the most difficult cases of instincts,  whether they could be _possibly_ acquired. I do not say _probably_, for  that belongs to our 3rd Part{96}, I beg this may be remembered, nor do I  mean to attempt to show exact method. I want only to show that whole  theory ought not at once to be rejected on this score.         {94} In the MS. of 1844 is an interesting discussion on _faculty_       as distinct from _instinct_.         {95} At this date and for long afterwards the inheritance of       acquired characters was assumed to occur.         {96} Part II. is here intended: see the Introduction.    Every instinct must, by my theory, have been acquired gradually by  slight changes <illegible> of former instinct, each change being useful  to its then species. Shamming death struck me at first as remarkable  objection. I found none really sham death{97}, and that there is  gradation; now no one doubts that those insects which do it either more  or less, do it for some good, if then any species was led to do it more,  and then <?> escaped &c. &c.         {97} The meaning is that the attitude assumed in _shamming_ is not       accurately like that of death.    Take migratory instincts, faculty distinct from instinct, animals have  notion of time,--like savages. Ordinary finding way by memory, but how  does savage find way across country,--as incomprehensible to us, as  animal to them,--geological changes,--fishes in river,--case of sheep in  Spain{98}. Architectural instincts,--a manufacturer's employee in making  single articles extraordinary skill,--often said seem to make it almost  <illegible>, child born with such a notion of playing{99},--we can  fancy tailoring acquired in same perfection,--mixture of  reason,--water-ouzel,--taylor-bird,--gradation of simple nest to most  complicated.         {98} This refers to the _transandantes_ sheep mentioned in the MS.       of 1844, as having acquired a migratory instinct.         {99} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 209, vi. p. 321, Mozart's       pseudo-instinctive skill in piano-playing is mentioned. See _Phil.       Trans._, 1770, p. 54.    Bees again, distinction of faculty,--how they make a  hexagon,--Waterhouse's theory{100},--the impulse to use whatever faculty  they possess,--the taylor-bird has the faculty of sewing with beak,  instinct impels him to do it.         {100} In the discussion on bees' cells, _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 225,       vi. p. 343, the author acknowledges that his theory originated in       Waterhouse's observations.    Last case of parent feeding young with different food (take case of  Galapagos birds, gradation from Hawfinch to Sylvia) selection and habit  might lead old birds to vary taste <?> and form, leaving their instinct of  feeding their young with same food{101},--or I see no difficulty in  parents being forced or induced to vary the food brought, and selection  adapting the young ones to it, and thus by degree any amount of  diversity might be arrived at. Although we can never hope to see the  course revealed by which different instincts have been acquired, for we  have only present animals (not well known) to judge of the course of  gradation, yet once grant the principle of habits, whether congenital or  acquired by experience, being inherited and I can see no limit to the  [amount of variation] extraordinariness <?> of the habits thus acquired.         {101} The hawfinch-and _Sylvia-_types are figured in the _Journal       of Researches_, p. 379. The discussion of change of form in       relation to change of instinct is not clear, and I find it       impossible to suggest a paraphrase.    _Summing up this Division._ If variation be admitted to occur  occasionally in some wild animals, and how can we doubt it, when we see  [all] thousands <of> organisms, for whatever use taken by man, do vary.  If we admit such variations tend to be hereditary, and how can we doubt  it when we <remember> resemblances of features and character,--disease  and monstrosities inherited and endless races produced (1200 cabbages).  If we admit selection is steadily at work, and who will doubt it, when  he considers amount of food on an average fixed and reproductive powers  act in geometrical ratio. If we admit that external conditions vary, as  all geology proclaims, they have done and are now doing,--then, if no  law of nature be opposed, there must occasionally be formed races,  [slightly] differing from the parent races. So then any such law{102},  none is known, but in all works it is assumed, in <?> flat contradiction  to all known facts, that the amount of possible variation is soon  acquired. Are not all the most varied species, the oldest domesticated:  who <would> think that horses or corn could be produced? Take dahlia and  potato, who will pretend in 5000 years{103} <that great changes might  not be effected>: perfectly adapted to conditions and then again brought  into varying conditions. Think what has been done in few last years,  look at pigeons, and cattle. With the amount of food man can produce he  may have arrived at limit of fatness or size, or thickness of wool <?>,  but these are the most trivial points, but even in these I conclude it  is impossible to say we know the limit of variation. And therefore with  the [adapting] selecting power of nature, infinitely wise compared to  those of man, <I conclude> that it is impossible to say we know the limit  of races, which would be true <to their> kind; if of different  constitutions would probably be infertile one with another, and which  might be adapted in the most singular and admirable manner, according to  their wants, to external nature and to other surrounding  organisms,--such races would be species. But is there any evidence <that>  species <have> been thus produced, this is a question wholly independent  of all previous points, and which on examination of the kingdom of  nature <we> ought to answer one way or another.         {102} I should interpret this obscure sentence as follows, \"No such       opposing law is known, but in all works on the subject a law is (in       flat contradiction to all known facts) assumed to limit the       possible amount of variation.\" In the _Origin_, the author never       limits the power of variation, as far as I know.         {103} In _Var. under Dom._ Ed. 2, ii. p. 263, the _Dahlia_ is       described as showing sensitiveness to conditions in 1841. All the       varieties of the _Dahlia_ are said to have arisen since 1804       (_ibid._ i. p. 393).          PART II{104}.         {104} In the original MS. the heading is: Part III.; but Part II.       is clearly intended; for details see the Introduction. I have not       been able to discover where Sec. IV. ends and Sec. V. begins.      Sec.Sec. IV. & V. <ON THE EVIDENCE FROM GEOLOGY.>    I may premise, that according to the view ordinarily received, the  myriads of organisms peopling this world have been created by so many  distinct acts of creation. As we know nothing of the <illegible> will of a  Creator,--we can see no reason why there should exist any relation  between the organisms thus created; or again, they might be created  according to any scheme.

Tom decided it was time to make his boat do its best, so he  set the timer at the limit, and the spark, coming more quickly,  increased the explosions.    Up shot the ARROW and, straightening out after the turn, Tom's craft  crept along until it lapped the stern of the RED STREAK.  Andy looked  back in dismay.  Then he tried to get more speed out of his engine.  He  did cause the screw to revolve a little faster, and Tom noted that he  was again being left behind.  Then one of those things, which may  happen at any time to a gasoline motor, happened to Andy's.  It began  to miss explosions.  At first it was only occasionally, then the misses  became more frequent.    The owner of the RED STREAK with one hand on the steering wheel, tried  with the other to adjust the motor to get rid of the trouble, but he  only made it worse.  Andy's boat began to fall back and Tom's to creep  up.  Frantically Andy worked the gasoline and sparking levers, but  without avail.  At last one cylinder went completely out of service.    The two boats were now on even terms and were racing along side by side  toward the wooded, point, which marked the finish.    \"I'll beat you yet!\" exclaimed Andy fiercely.    \"Better hurry up!\" retorted Tom.    But the young inventor was not to have it all his own way.  With a  freakishness equal to that with which it had ceased to explode the dead  cylinder came to life again, and the RED STREAK shot ahead.  Once more  Andy's boat had the lead of a length and the finish of the race was  close at hand.  The squint-eyed lad turned and shouted: \"I told you I'd  beat you!  Want a tow now?\"    It began to look as though Tom would need it, but he still had  something in reserve.  One of the improvements he had put in the ARROW  was a new auxiliary ignition system.  This he now decided to use.    With a quick motion Tom threw over the switch that put it into  operation.  A hotter, \"fatter\" spark was at once produced, and  adjusting his gasoline cock so that a little more of the fluid would be  drawn in, making a \"richer\" mixture, the owner of the ARROW saw the  craft shoot forward as if, like some weary runner, new life had been  infused.    In vain did Andy frantically try to get more speed out of his motor.  He cut out the muffler, and the explosions sounded loudly over the  lake.  But it was no use.  A minute later the ARROW, which had slowly  forged ahead, crossed the bows of the RED STREAK opposite the finishing  point, and Tom had won the race.    \"Well, was that fair?\" our hero called to Andy, who had quickly shut  off some of his power as he saw his rival's daring trick.  \"Did I beat  you fair?\"    \"You wouldn't have beaten me if my engine hadn't gone back on me,\"  grumbled Andy, chagrin showing on his face.  \"Wait until my motor runs  smoother and I'll give you a big handicap and beat you.  My boat's  faster than yours.  It ought to be.  It cost fifteen hundred dollars  and it's a racer.\"    \"I guess it doesn't like racing,\" commented Tom as he swung the prow of  his craft down the lake toward his home.  But he knew there was some  truth in what Andy had said.  The RED STREAK was a more speedy boat,  and, with proper handling, could have beaten the ARROW.  That was where  Tom's superior knowledge came in useful.  \"Just you wait, I'll beat you  yet,\" called Andy, after the young inventor, but the latter made no  answer.  He was satisfied.    Mr. Swift was much interested that night in his son's account of the  race.    \"I had no idea yours was such a speedy boat,\" he said.    \"Well, it wasn't originally,\" admitted Tom, \"but the improvements I put  on it made it so.  But, dad, when are we going on our tour?  You look  more worn out than I've seen you in some time, not excepting when the  turbine model was stolen.  Are you worrying over your gyroscope  invention?\"    \"Somewhat, Tom.  I can't seem to hit on just what I want.  It's a  difficult problem.\"    \"Then I tell you what let's do, dad.  Let's drop everything in the  inventive line and go off on a vacation.  I'll take you up the lake in  my boat and you can spend a week at the Lakeview Hotel at Sandport.  It  will do you good.\"    \"What will you do, Tom?\"    \"Oh, Ned Newton and I will cruise about and we'll take you along any  time you want to go.  We're going to camp out nights or sleep in the  boat if it rains.  I've ordered a canopy with side curtains.  Ned and I  don't care for the hotel life in the summer.  Will you go?\"    Mr. Swift considered a moment.  He did need a rest, for he had been  working hard and his brain was weary with thinking of many problems.  His son's program sounded very attractive.    \"I think I will accept,\" said the inventor with a smile.  \"When can you  start, Tom?\"    \"In about four days.  Ned Newton will get his vacation then and I'll  have the canopy on.  I'll start to work at it to-morrow.  Then we'll go  on a trip.\"    Sandport was a summer resort at the extreme southern end of Lake  Carlopa, and Mr. Swift at once wrote to the Lakeview Hotel there to  engage a room for himself.  In the meanwhile Tom began to put the  canopy on his boat and arrange for the trip, which would take nearly a  whole day.  Ned Newton was delighted with the prospect of a camping  tour and helped Tom to get ready.  They took a small tent and plenty of  supplies, with some food.  They did not need to carry many rations, as  the shores of the lake were lined with towns and villages where food  could be procured.    Finally all was ready for the trip and the night before the start Ned  Newton stayed at Tom's house so as to be in readiness for going off  early in the morning.  The day was all that could be desired, Tom  noted, as he and his chum hurried down to the dock before breakfast to  put their blankets in the boat.  As the young inventor entered the  craft he uttered an exclamation.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Ned.    \"I was sure I locked the sliding door of that forward compartment,\" was  the reply.  \"Now it's open.\"  He looked inside the space occupied by  the gasoline tank and cried out:  \"One of the braces is gone!  There's  been some one at my boat in the night and they tried to damage her.\"    \"Much harm done?\" asked Ned anxiously.    \"No, none at all, to speak of,\" replied Tom.  \"I can easily put a new  block under the tank.  In fact, I don't really need all I have.  But  why should any one take one out, and who did it?  That's what I want to  know.\"    The two lads looked carefully about the dock and boat for a sign of the  missing block or any clews that might show who had been tampering with  the ARROW, but they could find nothing.    \"Maybe the block fell out,\" suggested Ned.    \"It couldn't,\" replied Tom.  \"It was one of the new ones I put in  myself and it was nailed fast.  You can see where it's been pried  loose.  I can't understand it,\" and Tom thought rapidly of several  mysterious occurrences of late in which the strange man at the auction  and the person he had surprised one night in the boathouse had a part.    \"Well, it needn't delay our trip,\" resumed the young inventor.  \"Maybe  there's a hoodoo around here, and it will do us good to get away a few  days.  Come on, we'll have breakfast, get dad and start.\"    A little later the ARROW was puffing away up the lake in the direction  of Sandport.          CHAPTER IX    MR. SWIFT IS ALARMED      \"Don't you feel better already, dad?\" asked Tom that noon as they  stopped under a leaning, overhanging tree for lunch on the shore of the  lake.  \"I'll leave it to Ned if you don't look more contented and less  worried.\"    \"I believe he does,\" agreed the other lad.  \"Well, I must say I  certainly have enjoyed the outing so far,\" admitted the inventor with a  smile.  \"And I haven't been bothering about my gyroscope.  I think I'll  take another sandwich, Tom, and a few more olives.\"    \"That's the way to talk!\" cried the son.  \"Your appetite is improving,  too.  If Mrs. Baggert could see you she'd say so.\"    \"Oh, yes, Mrs. Baggert.  I do hope she and Garret will look after the  house and shops well,\" said Mr. Swift, and the old, worried look came  like a shadow over his face.    \"Now don't be thinking of that, dad,\" advised Tom, \"Of course  everything will be all right.  Do you think some of those model thieves  will return and try to get some of your other inventions?\"    \"I don't know, Tom.  Those men were unscrupulous scoundrels, and you  can never tell what they might do to revenge themselves on us for  defeating their plans.\"    \"Well, I guess Garret and Mrs. Baggert will look out for them,\"  remarked his son.  \"Don't worry.\"    \"Yes, it's bad for the digestion,\" added Ned.  \"If you don't mind, Tom,  I'll have some more coffee and another sandwich myself.\"    \"Nothing the matter with your appetite, either,\" commented the young  inventor as he passed the coffee pot and the plate.    They were soon on their way again, the ARROW making good time up the  lake.  Tom was at the engine, making several minor adjustments to it,  while Ned steered.  Mr. Swift reclined on one of the cushioned seats  under the shade of the canopy.  The young owner of the ARROW looked  over the stretch of water from time to time for a possible sight of  Andy Foger, but the RED STREAK was not to be seen.  The Lakeview Hotel  was reached late that afternoon and the boat was tied up to the dock,  while Tom and Ned accompanied Mr. Swift to see him comfortably  established in his room.    \"Won't you stay to supper with me?\" invited the inventor to his son and  the latter's chum.  \"Or do you want to start right in on camp life?\"    \"I guess we'll stay to supper and remain at the hotel to-night,\"  decided Tom.  \"We got here a little later than I expected, and Ned and  I hardly have time to go very far and establish a temporary camp.  We'll live a life of luxurious ease to-night and begin to be  'wanderlusters' and get back to nature to-morrow.\"    In the morning Tom and his chum, full of"]]]
