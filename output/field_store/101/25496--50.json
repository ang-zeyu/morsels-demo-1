To me she has been honest and kind and  devoted.\"    \"Devoted, of course; she wished you to marry her candidate. She told me  she was watching you only in order to interpose.\"    \"She said that to please you,\" the girl answered; conscious, however, of  the inadequacy of the explanation.    \"To please me by deceiving me? She knows me better. Am I pleased  to-day?\"    \"I don't think you're ever much pleased,\" Isabel was obliged to reply.  \"If Madame Merle knew you would learn the truth what had she to gain by  insincerity?\"    \"She gained time, as you see. While I waited for her to interfere you  were marching away, and she was really beating the drum.\"    \"That's very well. But by your own admission you saw I was marching, and  even if she had given the alarm you wouldn't have tried to stop me.\"    \"No, but some one else would.\"    \"Whom do you mean?\" Isabel asked, looking very hard at her aunt. Mrs.  Touchett's little bright eyes, active as they usually were, sustained  her gaze rather than returned it. \"Would you have listened to Ralph?\"    \"Not if he had abused Mr. Osmond.\"    \"Ralph doesn't abuse people; you know that perfectly. He cares very much  for you.\"    \"I know he does,\" said Isabel; \"and I shall feel the value of it now,  for he knows that whatever I do I do with reason.\"    \"He never believed you would do this. I told him you were capable of it,  and he argued the other way.\"    \"He did it for the sake of argument,\" the girl smiled. \"You don't accuse  him of having deceived you; why should you accuse Madame Merle?\"    \"He never pretended he'd prevent it.\"    \"I'm glad of that!\" cried Isabel gaily. \"I wish very much,\" she  presently added, \"that when he comes you'd tell him first of my  engagement.\"    \"Of course I'll mention it,\" said Mrs. Touchett. \"I shall say nothing  more to you about it, but I give you notice I shall talk to others.\"    \"That's as you please. I only meant that it's rather better the  announcement should come from you than from me.\"    \"I quite agree with you; it's much more proper!\" And on this the aunt  and the niece went to breakfast, where Mrs. Touchett, as good as her  word, made no allusion to Gilbert Osmond. After an interval of silence,  however, she asked her companion from whom she had received a visit an  hour before.    \"From an old friend--an American gentleman,\" Isabel said with a colour  in her cheek.    \"An American gentleman of course. It's only an American gentleman who  calls at ten o'clock in the morning.\"    \"It was half-past ten; he was in a great hurry; he goes away this  evening.\"    \"Couldn't he have come yesterday, at the usual time?\"    \"He only arrived last night.\"    \"He spends but twenty-four hours in Florence?\" Mrs. Touchett cried.  \"He's an American gentleman truly.\"    \"He is indeed,\" said Isabel, thinking with perverse admiration of what  Caspar Goodwood had done for her.    Two days afterward Ralph arrived; but though Isabel was sure that Mrs.  Touchett had lost no time in imparting to him the great fact, he showed  at first no open knowledge of it. Their prompted talk was naturally of  his health; Isabel had many questions to ask about Corfu. She had been  shocked by his appearance when he came into the room; she had forgotten  how ill he looked. In spite of Corfu he looked very ill to-day, and she  wondered if he were really worse or if she were simply disaccustomed  to living with an invalid. Poor Ralph made no nearer approach to  conventional beauty as he advanced in life, and the now apparently  complete loss of his health had done little to mitigate the natural  oddity of his person. Blighted and battered, but still responsive and  still ironic, his face was like a lighted lantern patched with paper  and unsteadily held; his thin whisker languished upon a lean cheek; the  exorbitant curve of his nose defined itself more sharply. Lean he was  altogether, lean and long and loose-jointed; an accidental cohesion of  relaxed angles. His brown velvet jacket had become perennial; his  hands had fixed themselves in his pockets; he shambled and stumbled and  shuffled in a manner that denoted great physical helplessness. It was  perhaps this whimsical gait that helped to mark his character more than  ever as that of the humorous invalid--the invalid for whom even his own  disabilities are part of the general joke. They might well indeed with  Ralph have been the chief cause of the want of seriousness marking his  view of a world in which the reason for his own continued presence was  past finding out. Isabel had grown fond of his ugliness; his awkwardness  had become dear to her. They had been sweetened by association; they  struck her as the very terms on which it had been given him to be  charming. He was so charming that her sense of his being ill had  hitherto had a sort of comfort in it; the state of his health had seemed  not a limitation, but a kind of intellectual advantage; it absolved him  from all professional and official emotions and left him the luxury of  being exclusively personal. The personality so resulting was delightful;  he had remained proof against the staleness of disease; he had had to  consent to be deplorably ill, yet had somehow escaped being formally  sick. Such had been the girl's impression of her cousin; and when she  had pitied him it was only on reflection. As she reflected a good deal  she had allowed him a certain amount of compassion; but she always had  a dread of wasting that essence--a precious article, worth more to the  giver than to any one else. Now, however, it took no great sensibility  to feel that poor Ralph's tenure of life was less elastic than it should  be. He was a bright, free, generous spirit, he had all the illumination  of wisdom and none of its pedantry, and yet he was distressfully dying.    Isabel noted afresh that life was certainly hard for some people,  and she felt a delicate glow of shame as she thought how easy it now  promised to become for herself. She was prepared to learn that Ralph was  not pleased with her engagement; but she was not prepared, in spite of  her affection for him, to let this fact spoil the situation. She was not  even prepared, or so she thought, to resent his want of sympathy; for  it would be his privilege--it would be indeed his natural line--to find  fault with any step she might take toward marriage. One's cousin always  pretended to hate one's husband; that was traditional, classical; it  was a part of one's cousin's always pretending to adore one. Ralph was  nothing if not critical; and though she would certainly, other things  being equal, have been as glad to marry to please him as to please any  one, it would be absurd to regard as important that her choice should  square with his views. What were his views after all? He had pretended  to believe she had better have married Lord Warburton; but this was  only because she had refused that excellent man. If she had accepted  him Ralph would certainly have taken another tone; he always took the  opposite. You could criticise any marriage; it was the essence of a  marriage to be open to criticism. How well she herself, should she only  give her mind to it, might criticise this union of her own! She had  other employment, however, and Ralph was welcome to relieve her of the  care. Isabel was prepared to be most patient and most indulgent. He must  have seen that, and this made it the more odd he should say nothing.  After three days had elapsed without his speaking our young woman  wearied of waiting; dislike it as he would, he might at least go through  the form. We, who know more about poor Ralph than his cousin, may easily  believe that during the hours that followed his arrival at Palazzo  Crescentini he had privately gone through many forms. His mother had  literally greeted him with the great news, which had been even more  sensibly chilling than Mrs. Touchett's maternal kiss. Ralph was shocked  and humiliated; his calculations had been false and the person in the  world in whom he was most interested was lost. He drifted about the  house like a rudderless vessel in a rocky stream, or sat in the garden  of the palace on a great cane chair, his long legs extended, his head  thrown back and his hat pulled over his eyes. He felt cold about the  heart; he had never liked anything less. What could he do, what could  he say? If the girl were irreclaimable could he pretend to like it?  To attempt to reclaim her was permissible only if the attempt should  succeed. To try to persuade her of anything sordid or sinister in the  man to whose deep art she had succumbed would be decently discreet only  in the event of her being persuaded. Otherwise he should simply have  damned himself. It cost him an equal effort to speak his thought and to  dissemble; he could neither assent with sincerity nor protest with hope.  Meanwhile he knew--or rather he supposed--that the affianced pair were  daily renewing their mutual vows. Osmond at this moment showed himself  little at Palazzo Crescentini; but Isabel met him every day elsewhere,  as she was free to do after their engagement had been made public. She  had taken a carriage by the month, so as not to be indebted to her aunt  for the means of pursuing a course of which Mrs. Touchett disapproved,  and she drove in the morning to the Cascine. This suburban wilderness,  during the early hours, was void of all intruders, and our young lady,  joined by her lover in its quietest part, strolled with him a while  through the grey Italian shade and listened to the nightingales.        CHAPTER XXXIV    One morning, on her return from her drive, some half-hour before  luncheon, she quitted her vehicle in the court of the palace and,  instead of ascending the great staircase, crossed the court, passed  beneath another archway and entered the garden. A sweeter spot at this  moment could not have been imagined. The stillness of noontide hung over  it, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#9)"],[1," repair of all the devices. Jason did much  better than the child students, though the effort exhausted him.    In the afternoon he had his first experience with a training machine.  His instructor was a twelve-year-old boy, whose cold voice didn't  conceal his contempt for the soft off-worlder.    \"All the training machines are physical duplicates of the real surface  of the planet, corrected constantly as the life forms change. The only  difference between them is the varying degree of deadliness. This first  machine you will use is of course the one infants are put into--\"    \"You're too kind,\" Jason murmured. \"Your flattery overwhelms me.\" The  instructor continued, taking no notice of the interruption.    \"... Infants are put into as soon as they can crawl. It is real in  substance, though completely deactivated.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Training machine was the wrong word, Jason realized as they entered  through the thick door. This was a chunk of the outside world duplicated  in an immense chamber. It took very little suspension of reality for him  to forget the painted ceiling and artificial sun high above and imagine  himself outdoors at last. The scene _seemed_ peaceful enough. Though  clouds banking on the horizon threatened a violent Pyrran storm.    \"You must wander around and examine things,\" the instructor told Jason.  \"Whenever you touch something with your hand, you will be told about it.  Like this--\"    The boy bent over and pushed his finger against a blade of the soft  grass that covered the ground. Immediately a voice barked from hidden  speakers.    \"Poison grass. Boots to be worn at all times.\"    Jason kneeled and examined the grass. The blade was tipped with a hard,  shiny hook. He realized with a start that every single blade of grass  was the same. The soft green lawn was a carpet of death. As he  straightened up he glimpsed something under a broad-leafed plant. A  crouching, scale-covered animal, whose tapered head terminated in a long  spike.    \"What's _that_ in the bottom of my garden?\" he asked. \"You certainly  give the babies pleasant playmates.\" Jason turned and realized he was  talking to the air, the instructor was gone. He shrugged and petted the  scaly monstrosity.    \"Horndevil,\" the impersonal voice said from midair. \"Clothing and shoes  no protection. Kill it.\"    A sharp _crack_ shattered the silence as Jason's gun went off. The  horndevil fell on its side, keyed to react to the blank charge.    \"Well ... I _am_ learning,\" Jason said, and the thought pleased him. The  words _kill it_ had been used by Brucco while teaching him to use the  gun. Their stimulus had reached an unconscious level. He was aware of  wanting to shoot only after he had heard the shot. His respect for  Pyrran training techniques went up.    Jason spent a thoroughly unpleasant afternoon wandering in the child's  garden of horror. Death was everywhere. While all the time the  disembodied voice gave him stern advice in simple language. So he could  do unto, rather than being done in. He had never realized that violent  death could come in so many repulsive forms. _Everything_ here was  deadly to man--from the smallest insect to the largest plant.    Such singleness of purpose seemed completely unnatural. Why was this  planet so alien to human life? He made a mental note to ask Brucco.  Meanwhile he tried to find one life form that wasn't out for his blood.  He didn't succeed. After a long search he found the only thing that when  touched didn't elicit deadly advice. This was a chunk of rock that  projected from a meadow of poison grass. Jason sat on it with a friendly  feeling and pulled his feet up. An oasis of peace. Some minutes passed  while he rested his gravity-weary body.    \"ROTFUNGUS--DO NOT TOUCH!\"    The voice blasted at twice its normal volume and Jason leaped as if he  had been shot. The gun was in his hand, nosing about for a target. Only  when he bent over and looked closely at the rock where he had been  sitting, did he understand. There were flaky gray patches that hadn't  been there when he sat down.    \"Oh you tricky devils!\" he shouted at the machine. \"How many kids have  you frightened off that rock after they thought they had found a little  peace!\" He resented the snide bit of conditioning, but respected it at  the same time. Pyrrans learned very early in life that there was no  safety on this planet--except that which they provided for themselves.    While he was learning about Pyrrus he was gaining new insight into the  Pyrrans as well.          VIII.      Days turned into weeks in the school, cut off from the world outside.  Jason almost became proud of his ability to deal death. He recognized  all the animals and plants in the nursery room and had been promoted to  a trainer where the beasts made sluggish charges at him. His gun picked  off the attackers with dull regularity. The constant, daily classes were  beginning to bore him as well.    Though the gravity still dragged at him, his muscles were making great  efforts to adjust. After the daily classes he no longer collapsed  immediately into bed. Only the nightmares got worse. He had finally  mentioned them to Brucco, who mixed up a sleeping potion that took away  most of their effect. The dreams were still there, but Jason was only  vaguely aware of them upon awakening.    By the time Jason had mastered all the gadgetry that kept the Pyrrans  alive, he had graduated to a most realistic trainer that was only a  hair-breadth away from the real thing. The difference was just in  quality. The insect poisons caused swelling and pain instead of instant  death. Animals could cause bruises and tear flesh, but stopped short of  ripping off limbs. You couldn't get killed in this trainer, but could  certainly come very close to it.    Jason wandered through this large and rambling jungle with the rest of  the five-year-olds. There was something a bit humorous, yet sad, about  their unchildlike grimness. Though they still might laugh in their  quarters, they realized there was no laughing outside. To them survival  was linked up with social acceptance and desirability. In this way  Pyrrus was a simple black-and-white society. To prove your value to  yourself and your world, you only had to stay alive. This had great  importance in racial survival, but had very stultifying effects on  individual personality. Children were turned into like-faced killers,  always on the alert to deal out death.    Some of the children graduated into the outside world and others took  their places. Jason watched this process for a while before he realized  that all of those from the original group he had entered with were gone.  That same day he looked up the chief of the adaptation center.    \"Brucco,\" Jason asked, \"how long do you plan to keep me in this  kindergarten shooting gallery?\"    \"You're not being 'kept' here,\" Brucco told him in his usual irritated  tone. \"You will be here until you qualify for the outside.\"    [Illustration]    \"Which I have a funny feeling will be never. I can now field strip and  reassemble every one of your blasted gadgets in the dark. I am a dead  shot with this cannon. At this present moment, if I had to, I could  write a book on the Complete Flora and Fauna of Pyrrus, and How to Kill  It. Perhaps I don't do as well as my six-year-old companions, but I have  a hunch I do about as good a job now as I ever will. Is that true?\"    Brucco squirmed with the effort to be evasive, yet didn't succeed. \"I  think, that is, you know you weren't born here, and--\"    \"Come, come,\" Jason said with glee, \"a straight-faced old Pyrran like  you shouldn't try to lie to one of the weaker races that specialize in  that sort of thing. It goes without saying that I'll always be sluggish  with this gravity, as well as having other inborn handicaps. I admit  that. We're not talking about that now. The question is--will I improve  with more training, or have I reached a peak of my own _development_  now?\"    Brucco sweated. \"With the passage of time there will be improvement of  course--\"    \"Sly devil!\" Jason waggled a finger at him. \"Yes or no, now. Will I  improve _now_ by more training _now_?\"    \"No,\" Brucco said, and still looked troubled. Jason sized him up like a  poker hand.    \"Now let's think about that. I won't improve--yet I'm still stuck here.  That's no accident. So you must have been ordered to keep me here. And  from what I have seen of this planet, admittedly very little, I would  say that Kerk ordered you to keep me here. Is that right?\"    \"He was only doing it for your own sake,\" Brucco explained, \"trying to  keep you alive.\"    \"The truth is out,\" Jason said, \"so let us now forget about it. I didn't  come here to shoot robots with your offspring. So please show me the  street door. Or is there a graduating ceremony first? Speeches, handing  out school pins, sabers overhead--\"    \"Nothing like that,\" Brucco snapped. \"I don't see how a grown man like  you can talk such nonsense all the time. There is none of that, of  course. Only some final work in the partial survival chamber. That is a  compound that connects with the outside--really is a part of the  outside--except the most violent life forms are excluded. And even some  of those manage to find their way in once in a while.\"    \"When do I go?\" Jason shot the question.    \"Tomorrow morning. Get a good night's sleep first. You'll need it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    There was one bit of ceremony attendant with the graduation. When Jason  came into his office in the morning, Brucco slid a heavy gun clip across  the table.    \"These are live bullets,\" he said. \"I'm sure you'll be needing them.  After this your gun will always be loaded.\"    They came up to a heavy air lock, the only locked door Jason had seen in  the center. While Brucco unlocked it and threw the bolts, a sober-faced  eight-year-old with a bandaged leg"]]]
