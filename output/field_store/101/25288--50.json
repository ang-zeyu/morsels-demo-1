This  combination of seemingly opposite qualities forms his great charm for  us to-day, and it must have proved as great an attraction to many of the  Venetians of his own time, for they were already far enough removed from  simplicity to appreciate to the full his singularly happy combination of  ceremony and splendour with an almost childlike naturalness of feeling.  Perhaps among his strongest admirers were the very men who most  appreciated Titian's distinction and Tintoretto's poetry. But it is  curious to note that Paolo's chief employers were the monasteries. His  cheerfulness, and his frank and joyous worldliness, the qualities, in  short, which we find in his huge pictures of feasts, seem to have been  particularly welcome to those who were expected to make their meat and  drink of the very opposite qualities. This is no small comment on the  times, and shows how thorough had been the permeation of the spirit of  the Renaissance when even the religious orders gave up their pretence to  asceticism and piety.      =XXI. Bassano, Genre, and Landscape.=--Venetian painting would not have  been the complete expression of the riper Renaissance if it had  entirely neglected the country. City people have a natural love of the  country, but when it was a matter of doubt whether a man would ever  return if he ventured out of the town-gates, as was the case in the  Middle Ages, this love had no chance of showing itself. It had to wait  until the country itself was safe for wayfarers, a state of things which  came about in Italy with the gradual submission of the country to the  rule of the neighbouring cities and with the general advance of  civilisation. During the Renaissance the love of the country and its  pleasures received an immense impulse from Latin authors. What the great  Romans without exception recommended, an Italian was not slow to adopt,  particularly when, as in this case, it harmonised with natural  inclination and with an already common practice. It was the usual thing  with those who could afford to do so to retire to the villa for a large  part of the year. Classic poets helped such Italians to appreciate the  simplicity of the country and to feel a little of its beauty. Many took  such delight in country life that they wished to have reminders of it  in town. It may have been in response to some such half formulated wish  that Palma began to paint his \"Sante Conversazioni,\"--groups of saintly  personages gathered under pleasant trees in pretty landscapes. His  pupil, Bonifazio, continued the same line, gradually, however,  discarding the traditional group of Madonna and saints, and, under such  titles as \"The Rich Man's Feast\" or \"The Finding of Moses,\" painting all  the scenes of fashionable country life, music on the terrace of a villa,  hunting parties, and picnics in the forest.    Bonifazio's pupil, Jacopo Bassano, no less fond of painting country  scenes, did not however confine himself to representing city people in  their parks. His pictures were for the inhabitants of the small  market-town from which he takes his name, where inside the gates you  still see men and women in rustic garb crouching over their  many-coloured wares; and where, just outside the walls, you may see all  the ordinary occupations connected with farming and grazing. Inspired,  although unawares, by the new idea of giving perfectly modern versions  of biblical stories, Bassano introduced into nearly every picture he  painted episodes from the life in the streets of Bassano, and in the  county just outside the gates. Even Orpheus in his hands becomes a  farmer's lad fiddling to the barnyard fowls.    Bassano's pictures and those of his two sons, who followed him very  closely, found great favour in Venice and elsewhere, because they were  such unconscious renderings of simple country life, a kind of life whose  charm seemed greater and greater the more fashionable and ceremonious  private life in the city became. But this was far from being their only  charm. Just as the Church had educated people to understand painting as  a language, so the love of all the pleasant things that painting  suggested led in time to the love of this art as its own end, serving no  obvious purpose either of decoration or suggestion, but giving pleasure  by the skilful management of light and shadow, and by the intrinsic  beauty of the colours. The third quarter of the sixteenth century thus  saw the rise of the picture-fancier, and the success of the Bassani was  so great because they appealed to this class in a special way. In  Venice there had long been a love of objects for their sensuous beauty.  At an early date the Venetians had perfected an art in which there is  scarcely any intellectual content whatever, and in which colour,  jewel-like or opaline, is almost everything. Venetian glass was at the  same time an outcome of the Venetians' love of sensuous beauty and a  continual stimulant to it. Pope Paul II., for example, who was a  Venetian, took such a delight in the colour and glow of jewels, that he  was always looking at them and always handling them. When painting,  accordingly, had reached the point where it was no longer dependent upon  the Church, nor even expected to be decorative, but when it was used  purely for pleasure, the day could not be far distant when people would  expect painting to give them the same enjoyment they received from  jewels and glass. In Bassano's works this taste found full satisfaction.  Most of his pictures seem at first as dazzling, then as cooling and  soothing, as the best kind of stained glass; while the colouring of  details, particularly of those under high lights, is jewel-like, as  clear and deep and satisfying as rubies and emeralds.    It need scarcely be added after all that has been said about light and  atmosphere in connection with Titian and Tintoretto, and their handling  of real life, that Bassano's treatment of both was even more masterly.  If this were not so, neither picture-fanciers of his own time, nor we  nowadays, should care for his works as we do. They represent life in far  more humble phases than even the pictures of Tintoretto, and, without  recompensing effects of light and atmosphere, they would not be more  enjoyable than the cheap work of the smaller Dutch masters. It must be  added, too, that without his jewel-like colouring, Bassano would often  be no more delightful than Teniers.    Another thing Bassano could not fail to do, working as he did in the  country, and for country people, was to paint landscape. He had to paint  the real country, and his skill in the treatment of light and atmosphere  was great enough to enable him to do it well. Bassano was in fact the  first modern landscape painter. Titian and Tintoretto and Giorgione,  and even Bellini and Cima before them, had painted beautiful landscapes,  but they were seldom direct studies from nature. They were decorative  backgrounds, or fine harmonising accompaniments to the religious or  human elements of the picture. They never failed to get grand and  effective lines--a setting worthy of the subject. Bassano did not need  such setting for his country versions of Bible stories, and he needed  them even less in his studies of rural life. For pictures of this kind  the country itself naturally seemed the best background and the best  accompaniment possible,--indeed, the only kind desirable. Without  knowing it, therefore, and without intending it, Bassano was the first  Italian who tried to paint the country as it really is, and not arranged  to look like scenery.      =XXII. The Venetians and Velasquez.=--Had Bassano's qualities, however,  been of the kind that appealed only to the collectors of his time, he  would scarcely rouse the strong interest we take in him. We care for him  chiefly because he has so many of the more essential qualities of great  art--truth to life, and spontaneity. He has another interest still, in  that he began to beat out the path which ended at last in Velasquez.  Indeed, one of the attractions of the Venetian school of painting is  that, more than all others, it went to form that great Spanish master.  He began as a sort of follower of Bassano, but his style was not fixed  before he had given years of study to Veronese, to Tintoretto, and to  Titian.      =XXIII. Decline of Venetian Art.=--Bassano appealed to collectors by mere  accident. He certainly did not work for them. The painters who came  after him and after Tintoretto no longer worked unconsciously, as  Veronese did, nor for the whole intelligent class, as Titian and  Tintoretto had done, but for people who prided themselves on their  connoisseurship.    Palma the Younger and Domenico Tintoretto began well enough as natural  followers of Tintoretto, but before long they became aware of their  inferiority to the masters who had preceded them, and, feeling no longer  the strength to go beyond them, fell back upon painting variations of  those pictures of Tintoretto and Titian which had proved most popular.  So their works recall the great masters, but only to bring out their own  weakness. Padovanino, Liberi, and Pietro della Vecchia went even lower  down and shamelessly manufactured pictures which, in the distant markets  for which they were intended, passed for works of Titian, Veronese, and  Giorgione. Nor are these pictures altogether unenjoyable. There are airs  by the great composers we so love that we enjoy them even when woven  into the compositions of some third-rate master.      =XXIV. Longhi.=--But Venetian painting was not destined to die unnoticed.  In the eighteenth century, before the Republic entirely disappeared,  Venice produced three or four painters who deserve at the least a place  with the best painters of that century.

Mr. Gourlay  evidently leaned to the belief that there was.[21] The Duke and his  son-in-law had passed through Niagara during the hot weather of July,  while the victim of Family Compact villainy was gradually having his  health and reason tortured out of him in the jail at that place. He was  of opinion that the two distinguished visitors should have exercised  their prerogative by setting him at liberty. This, of course, was an  altogether unreasonable belief. His Grace was not at all likely to  interfere in the matter, and as for Sir Peregrine, he was completely in  the hands of Mr. Gourlay's enemies. The belief, however, is worth  recording, as exhibiting the extent to which Mr. Gourlay's persecution  continued to prey upon his mind, even after the lapse of years, and when  he was in as good health as he ever regained.    It was deemed advisable that Mr. Gourlay's case should be a perpetual  warning to any and every person who might thereafter dare to tread in  his venturesome footsteps. Accordingly, as has been seen, he had to  drink the cup of mortification to the very dregs. And, by way of  deterring public writers from aiding and abetting any such pestilent  innovators for the future, it was determined that a notable example  should be made of the editor of the Niagara _Spectator_, who had dared  to side with the oppressed against the oppressor, and had published some  of Mr. Gourlay's attacks upon the abuses of the time. His name was  Bartemus Ferguson, and he had on several occasions manifested his  sympathy with projects of reform. The discipline inflicted upon him was  swift and severe. He was seized while in bed, in the middle of the  night, a hundred and fifty miles from home, conveyed to jail at Niagara,  and thence to York, where he was detained in prison for some days out of  the reach of friends to bail him. He was tried for sedition at the  Niagara assizes a day or two before Mr. Gourlay. In order that public  journalists of the present day may note in what comparatively pleasant  places their lines have fallen, I transcribe the sentence of the court,  which was as follows:--\"Therefore it is considered by the said court  here that the said Bartemus Ferguson do pay a fine to our said lord the  King of fifty pounds of lawful money of Upper Canada: That he, the said  Bartemus Ferguson, be imprisoned in the common jail of the District of  Niagara for the space of eighteen calendar months, to be computed from  the eighth day of November, in the sixtieth year of the reign of our  said lord the King: that in the course of the first month of the said  eighteen months he do stand in the public pillory one hour, between the  hours of ten o'clock in the forenoon and two o'clock in the afternoon:  and that at the expiration of the said imprisonment he do give security  for his good behaviour for the term of seven years: he the said Bartemus  Ferguson in the sum of five hundred pounds, and two sureties in the sum  of two hundred and fifty pounds each; and further, that he, the said  Bartemus Ferguson, do remain imprisoned in the said jail until the  aforesaid fine be paid and security given.\"    The composition for which the editor was thus held to so stern an  account was a letter written by Mr. Gourlay, and signed by his name,  published in the _Spectator_ during the editor's absence from home, and  without his knowledge. It animadverted pretty sharply on the  Administration of the day. In the jingling and jangling phraseology of  the indictment, it was calculated to \"detract, scandalize, and vilify  His Grace Charles Duke of Richmond, Lennox and Aubigny, Captain-General  and Governor in and over the Provinces of Lower and Upper Canada, Nova  Scotia and New Brunswick and their dependencies; and to scandalize and  vilify Sir Peregrine Maitland, Knight Commander of the Most Honourable  Military Order of the Bath, His Majesty's Lieutenant-Governor of this  Province of Upper Canada.\" Certain public officials, not specifically  alluded to by name, were referred to as fools and sycophants. But the  letter did not contain a syllable which was not literally true, and was  mildness itself when compared with letters and articles which are  constantly published with impunity in newspapers of all shades of  political opinion in these present times. It appears that, upon the  humble and unequivocal submission of the culprit, some of the most  severe penalties imposed by the court were remitted, and that he was  erelong allowed to resume his business;[22] but all enthusiasm for the  public good had meanwhile been crushed out of him, and he became one  more added to the list of subservient tools which the Executive always  managed to have at their control. Such were the glories of a free press  in enlightened Upper Canada sixty-six years ago. Such were the \"good old  times\" which our grandfathers are never weary of belauding to the echo.  How bright are the hues of retrospection! But for us of the present  generation, let us be thankful to the Giver of all Good that such brave  old times are long past, and that they can never return. Let them go;  but surely it is too much to expect us to pronounce a benison upon their  dead and departed dry bones.    Even before the commencement of proceedings against Mr. Gourlay under  the Alien Act, his conduct had furnished a pretext to those in authority  for striking a heavy blow against freedom of speech and action. The  holding of conventions, whereat meddlesome persons of the Gourlay stamp  might air their grievances and agitate for investigations into public  abuses, was a thing not to be tolerated in Upper Canada. Upon the  assembling of the Legislature at York, in October, 1818, the  Lieutenant-Governor, in his opening Speech, hinted at a law to prevent  the holding of such meetings; and in the course of the ensuing session a  Bill to effect that object was introduced into the Assembly by Mr. Jonas  Jones, member for Grenville. The Bill was supported by twelve out of the  thirteen members present, and was speedily passed into law; but, as will  hereafter be seen, it was not destined to a long life.           *       *       *       *       *    After a brief delay in the State of New York, Mr. Gourlay repaired to  Boston, and thence took ship for Liverpool. On a subsequent page we  shall catch one more brief glimpse of him, but with that exception the  present work has no further concern with his chequered existence. He  will be referred to from time to time, but only incidentally, and for  purposes of illustration. Those who may feel sufficient interest in him  to follow his fortunes and misfortunes to the bitter end, will find some  account of them in the authority quoted below.[23]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Not, however, his _immediate_ judicial successor.
