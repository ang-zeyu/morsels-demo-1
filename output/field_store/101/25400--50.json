Once when Robert Sallette and Andrew Walthour were marching with the  advance guard of the American troops, they suddenly met the advance  guard of the British. A short but sharp skirmish followed, during which  a very large man of the British guard was killed. Observing that the  dead man wore a pair of good boots, Sallette determined to get them.  While he was pulling them off in the midst of a furious fire from the  enemy, his companions called out to him to come away or he would surely  be killed. \"I must have the boots!\" cried Sallette to his companions. \"I  want them for little John Way!\"    Here was fun in the midst of tragedy; for it is said that little John  Way could have put both his feet and his fists into one of the boots.    One day Sallette dressed himself up as a British officer and accepted  an invitation to dine with a party of the enemy. Suddenly, in the midst  of the toasting and drinking, Sallette drew his sword, killed the men  who sat to the right and left of him, sprang on his horse, and rode off  unhurt, though he was in such a hurry that he had no time to throw the  bridle reins over the horse's head.    At the White House, near Sunbury, Major Baker, of the patriot army, with  thirty men, attacked and defeated a party of Tories under command of  Captain Goldsmith.    Among the slain was Lieutenant Gray, whose head was almost severed from  his body by a stroke of Robert Sallette's sword.    On many occasions, when a battle was in progress, Sallette would detach  himself from the American army, gain the rear of the enemy, and kill  many men before he was discovered. If this brave man was indeed a  descendant of the Acadians, he avenged the wrongs of many of his  countrymen.    Another character who attracted attention during the War of the  Revolution was Patrick Carr, whose hatred of the Tories made his name  celebrated among the Liberty Boys of Georgia. Paddy Carr, as he was  called, lived and died in Jefferson County. He was born in Ireland, but  came to Georgia before the Revolution. When the independence movement  began, he threw himself into it with all the ardor of his race. Owing to  the cruelty of the Tories, he conceived a special hatred against them.  He showed them no quarter. History gives but a word or two to his  achievements, but tradition still keeps his name alive in the region  where he operated. Like Sallette, he was an independent partisan; but,  unlike Sallette, his operations were among those who could remember well  enough, but who would not take the trouble to preserve the particulars  of even the least of his exploits. We know that Patrick Carr lived. We  know that he became famous where recklessness and daring were common.  But that is nearly all we know. It is said of him that during the war he  killed one hundred Tories with his own hands. Once, when praised for his  bravery, he smiled and shook his head, saying that he would have made  a very good soldier, but the Lord had given him a heart that was too  merciful. He no doubt remembered the atrocities of the Tories in the  section that is now Jefferson, Columbia, Burke, and Wilkes counties. The  cruelties they committed in that region during the Revolution have no  parallel in civilized warfare.    Among the adventurous characters of that time, on the side of the  British, Daniel McGirth stands easily first. The history of his career  during the war is a strange one. He was born in South Carolina,  and entered into the struggle against the British with the utmost  enthusiasm. He was a brave man, a hard fighter, and one of the most  active of those who took up arms against the King. He was an expert  woodsman, and was at home in the saddle. He was assigned to duty as a  scout, and was better equipped for that service, perhaps, than any man  in the American army. The ease with which he secured information of the  enemy's movements and plans, and the energy that marked his movements,  made his services of great value to the patriot cause. This was not  thoroughly appreciated by some of the officers under whom McGirth acted.    He brought with him into the army a mare which he called \"The Gray  Goose.\" She is said to have been an elegant animal, and McGirth was  very proud of her. With this mare under him, he always felt safe  from pursuit. One of the American officers, who was a good judge of  horseflesh, and who probably wanted to \"cut a dash,\" as the saying is,  saw this beautiful mare, and coveted her. Finding that McGirth scorned  all offers to sell her, the officer adopted various means to obtain her.  These efforts were resisted by McGirth, mainly on the ground that the  mare was his own private property, and that she was essential to the  duties he was called on to perform. Failing to gain his ends in this  way, the officer continued to worry McGirth in other ways. He no doubt  did something to rouse the ire of the scout, who was an irritable man,  and who felt the importance of the service he was rendering to the  cause. It is not now known how McGirth insulted the officer,--whether  in a moment of passion he struck him, or whether he merely used rough  language to him.    Whatever the offense, McGirth was placed under arrest, tried by a  court-martial, found guilty of violating the articles of war, and  sentenced to be whipped. He received this punishment, and was placed  in confinement again, where he was to remain until he received another  whipping. While thus held, he saw his mare picketed near the camp, and  he immediately resolved to escape. He was successful in this. Once free,  he secured The Gray Goose, leaped into the saddle, turned around, and,  in the face of his pursuers, pronounced threats of vengeance against all  the Americans for his ill treatment.    There is no doubt that he was illtreated; but if he had not been an  ignorant man, he would not have pronounced against the cause of liberty  on account of the treatment he received at the hands of individuals.  But the savage in his nature was aroused, and he carried out his fierce  threats to the fullest extent. For the time being, he attached himself  to another American command; but at the first opportunity he deserted  to the enemy, and became the scourge and terror of those who opposed the  British cause. He spared none. His field extended from the Florida line  to the Savannah River, in what is now Elbert County, and far into South  Carolina. He appeared when least expected, and carried destruction with  him. His mare became as noted as her master. In what was then Upper  Georgia, she was known as \"The Bald-faced Pony.\" On many an occasion  he owed his life to the fleetness of his mare. But his vengeance was  never satisfied: it was always active, and thirsting for the blood of  the American patriot. The whim of the officer to possess McGirth's mare  was a foolish one at best. It was the cause of great public and private  suffering.    [Illustration: McGirth and his mare 072]    When South Carolina was rescued from the British, McGirth retreated  into Georgia, and finally into Florida. When the Spaniards regained  possession of that territory, he became subject to their laws. For some  reason or other he was thrown into one of the dungeons of the old fort  at St. Augustine, where he was confined for five years. When released,  his health was broken, and it was with great difficulty that he managed  to return to Sumter District, in South Carolina, where his wife lived.    A very queer and eccentric character in the Revolution was Captain Rory  Mcintosh, of Mallow. Though Rory was a kinsman of General Lachlan and  Colonel John Mcintosh, who were among the most active Liberty Boys in  Georgia, he took up arms for the King, and a very devoted Tory he was.  His eccentricities would have been called whims if he had not stuck  to them with such constancy. He was a Highlander and a follower of the  Stuarts. How and why he became loyal to the new line of British kings,  history does not state; but his clan had a chief, and he no doubt  thought that every government ought to have a monarch. When the  Revolution began, he was over sixty years of age, and was living  comfortably on his plantation at Mallow; but he volunteered, and fought  through the war.    A story is told of Rory Mcintosh that once when the Spaniards held  East Florida, he carried to St Augustine a drove of cattle. He received  payment in dollars, which he placed in a canvas bag behind him on his  horse. When near his home, the bag gave way, and a part of the money  fell out. He secured what was left and rode on, paying no attention to  that which had fallen from the bag. When in need of money some years  after, he returned to the place where the dollars had spilled, picked  up as many as he wanted, and went back home. Whenever he could, he went  about accompanied by a piper. Rory was a tall, finely formed man,'with  bristling whiskers and a ruddy complexion: consequently when he appeared  on parade, he attracted great attention.    [Illustration: Captain Rory McIntosh 074]    In 1778 two expeditions were sent from St. Augustine for the purpose  of attacking Savannah,--one by sea, and one by land under command of  Lieutenant Colonel Prevost. This land expedition had been joined by  Captain Roderick Mcintosh, in the capacity of a volunteer. He attached  himself particularly to the infantry company commanded by Captain  Murray. When the British laid siege to Sunbury and the fort, Captain  Murray's company was in the line near the fort. One morning when Captain  Rory had had a dram too much, he determined to sally out and summon  the fort to surrender. His comrades tried to restrain him, but he was  determined. Finally he strutted out, a drawn claymore in his hand, with  his trusty slave Jim. He approached the fort and cried out,--    \"Surrender, you miscreants!

Let him come and meet me  there.\"    Then Skirnir put up his magic sword and drank the cup of mead that Gerda  gave him. He rode from Gymer's house, laughing aloud at having won Gerda  for Frey, and so making the magic sword his own for ever.    Skirnir the Venturesome, the heedless of his words, riding across  Bifroest on his mighty horse, found Frey standing waiting for him beside  Heimdall, the Warder of the Bridge to Asgard.    \"What news dost thou bring me?\" cried Frey. \"Speak, Skirnir, before thou  dost dismount from thine horse.\"    \"In nine nights from this thou mayst meet Gerda in Barri Wood,\" said  Skirnir. He looked at him, laughing out of his wide mouth and his blue  eyes. But Frey turned away, saying to himself:         Long is one day;       Long, long two.       Can I live through       Nine long days?    Long indeed were these days for Frey. But the ninth day came, and in the  evening Frey went to Barri Wood. And there he met Gerda, the Giant maid.  She was as fair as when he had seen her before the door of Gymer's  house. And when she saw Frey, so tall and noble looking, the Giant's  daughter was glad that Skirnir the Venturesome had made her promise to  come to Barri Wood. They gave each other rings of gold. It was settled  that the Giant maid should come as a bride to Asgard.    Gerda came, but another Giant maid came also. This is how that came to  be:    All the Dwellers in Asgard were standing before the great gate, waiting  to welcome the bride of Frey. There appeared a Giant maid who was not  Gerda; all in armor was she.    \"I am Skadi,\" she said, \"the daughter of Thiassi. My father met his  death at the hands of the Dwellers in Asgard. I claim a recompense.\"    \"What recompense would you have, maiden?\" asked Odin, smiling to see a  Giant maid standing so boldly in Asgard.    \"A husband from amongst you, even as Gerda. And I myself must be let  choose him.\"    All laughed aloud at the words of Skadi. Then said Odin, laughing, \"We  will let you choose a husband from amongst us, but you must choose him  by his feet.\"    \"I will choose him whatever way you will,\" said Skadi fixing her eyes on  Baldur, the most beautiful of all the Dwellers in Asgard.    They put a bandage round her eyes, and the AEsir and the Vanir seat in a  half circle around. As she went by she stooped over each and laid hands  upon their feet. At last she came to one whose feet were so finely  formed that she felt sure it was Baldur. She stood up and said:    \"This is the one that Skadi chooses for her husband.\"    Then the AEsir and the Vanir laughed more and more. They took the bandage  off her eyes and she saw, not Baldur the Beautiful, but Nioerd, the  father of Frey. But as Skadi looked more and more on Nioerd she became  more and more contented with her choice; for Nioerd was strong, and he  was noble looking.    These two, Nioerd and Skadi, went first to live in Nioerd's palace by the  sea; but the coming of the sea mew would waken Skadi too early in the  morning, and she drew her husband to the mountaintop where she was more  at home. He would not live long away from the sound of the sea. Back and  forward, between the mountain and the sea, Skadi and Nioerd went. But  Gerda stayed in Asgard with Frey, her husband, and the AEsir and the  Vanir came to love greatly Gerda, the Giant maid.          [Illustration]    HEIMDALL AND LITTLE HNOSSA: HOW ALL THINGS CAME TO BE      Hnossa, the child of Freya and the lost Odur, was the youngest of all  the Dwellers in Asgard. And because it had been prophesied that the  child would bring her father and her mother together, little Hnossa was  often taken without the City of the Gods to stand by Bifroest, the  Rainbow Bridge, so that she might greet Odur if his steps turned toward  Asgard.    In all the palaces of the City of the Gods little Hnossa was made  welcome: in Fensalir, the Halls of Mists, where Frigga, the wife of Odin  All-Father, sat spinning with golden threads; in Breidablik, where  Baldur, the Well Beloved, lived with his fair wife, the young Nanna; in  Bilskirnir, the Winding House, where Thor and Sif lived; and in Odin's  own palace Valaskjalf, that was all roofed over with silver shields.    The greatest of all the palaces was Gladsheim, that was built by the  golden-leaved wood, Glasir. Here the banquets of the Gods were held.  Often little Hnossa looked within and saw Odin All-Father seated at the  banquet table, with a mantle of blue over him and a shining helmet  shaped like an eagle upon his head. Odin would sit there, not eating at  all, but drinking the wine of the Gods, and taking the food off the  table and giving it to Geri and Freki, the two wolves that crouched  beside his seat.    She loved to go outside the great gate and stay beside Heimdall, the  Warder of the Rainbow Bridge. There, when there was no one crossing that  she might watch, she would sit beside Heimdall and listen to the wonders  that he spoke of.    Heimdall held in his hands the horn that was called the Gialarhorn. He  would sound it to let the Dwellers in Asgard know that one was crossing  the Rainbow Bridge. And Heimdall told little Hnossa how he had trained  himself to hear the grasses grow, and how he could see all around him  for a hundred miles. He could see in the night as well as the day. He  never slept. He had nine mothers, he told Hnossa, and he fed on the  strength of the earth and the cold sea.    As she sat beside him day after day, Heimdall would tell little Hnossa  how all things began. He had lived from the beginning of time and he  knew all things. \"Before Asgard was built,\" he said, \"and before Odin  lived, earth and sea and sky were all mixed together: what was then was  the Chasm of Chasms. In the North there was Niflheim, the Place of  Deadly Cold. In the South there was Muspelheim, the Land of Fire. In  Niflheim there was a cauldron called Hveigelmer that poured out twelve  rivers that flowed into the Chasm of Chasms.    \"Ginnungagap, the Chasm of Chasms, filled up with ice, for the waters of  the rivers froze as they poured into it. From Muspelheim came clouds of  fire that turned the ice into thick mists. The mists fell down again in  drops of dew, and from these drops were formed Ymir, the Ancient Giant.    \"Ymir, the Ancient Giant, traveled along by the twelve rivers until he  came to where another living form was standing in the mists. This was a  Giant Cow. Audhumla was the name of that cow. Ymir lay down beside her  and drank her milk, and on the milk she gave him he lived. Other beings  were formed out of the dew that fell to the ground. They were the  Daughters of the Frost, and Ymir, the Ancient Giant, married one, and  their children were the Giants.    \"One day Ymir saw Audhumla breathe upon a cliff of ice and lick with her  tongue the place she breathed on. As her tongue went over and over the  place he saw that a figure was being formed. It was not like a Giant's  form; it was more shapely and more beautiful. A head appeared in the  cliff and golden hair fell over the ice. As Ymir looked upon the being  that was being formed he hated him for his beauty.    \"Audhumla, the Giant Cow, went on licking the place where she had  breathed. At last a man completely formed stepped from the cliff. Ymir,  the Ancient Giant, hated him so much that he would have slain him then  and there. But he knew that if he did this, Audhumla would feed him no  more with her milk.    \"Bur was the name of the man who was formed in the ice cliff, Bur, the  first of the heroes. He, too, lived on the milk of Audhumla. He married  a daughter of the Ancient Giant and he had a son. But Ymir and Ymir's  sons hated Bur, and the time came at last when they were able to kill  him.    \"And now there was war between Ymir and Ymir's sons and the son and  son's sons of Bur. Odin was the son of Bur's son. Odin brought all his  brothers together, and they were able to destroy Ymir and all his  brood--all except one. So huge was Ymir that when he was slain his blood  poured out in such a mighty flood that his sons were all drowned in it,  all except Bergelmir, who was in a boat with his wife when the flood  came, and who floated away on the flood to the place that we now call  Joetunheim, the Realm of the Giants.    \"Now Odin and his sons took the body of Ymir--the vastest body that ever  was--and they flung it into the Chasm of Chasms, filling up all the  hollow places with it. They dug the bones out of the body and they piled  them up as the mountains. They took the teeth out and they made them  into the rocks. They took the hair of Ymir and they made it into the  forests of trees. They took his eyebrows and formed them into the place  where Men now dwell, Midgard. And out of Ymir's hollow skull they made  the sky.    \"And Odin and his sons and brothers did more than this. They took the  sparks and the clouds of flame that blew from Muspelheim, and they made  them into the sun and the moon and all the stars that are in the sky.  Odin found a dusky Giantess named Night whose son was called Day, and he  gave both of them horses to drive across the sky. Night drove a horse  that is named Hrimfaxe, Frosty Mane, and Day drove a horse that is named  Skinfaxe, Shining Mane. From Hrimfaxe's bit fall the drops that make the  dew upon the earth.    \"Then Odin and his sons made a race of men and women and gave them  Midgard to live in. Ugly Dwarfs had grown up and had spread themselves  over the earth. These Odin made go live in the hollow places beneath the  earth. The Elves he let stay on the earth, but he"]]]
