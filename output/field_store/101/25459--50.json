I can trust his word and I can trust his work; he is gentle and  clever with the horses, and I would rather have them in charge with him  than with half the young fellows I know of in laced hats and liveries;  and whoever wants a character of James Howard,\" said John, with a  decided jerk of his head, \"let them come to John Manly.\"    The master stood all this time grave and attentive, but as John finished  his speech a broad smile spread over his face, and looking kindly  across at James, who all this time had stood still at the door, he said,  \"James, my lad, set down the oats and come here; I am very glad to find  that John's opinion of your character agrees so exactly with my own.  John is a cautious man,\" he said, with a droll smile, \"and it is not  always easy to get his opinion about people, so I thought if I beat the  bush on this side the birds would fly out, and I should learn what I  wanted to know quickly; so now we will come to business. I have a letter  from my brother-in-law, Sir Clifford Williams, of Clifford Hall.  He wants me to find him a trustworthy young groom, about twenty or  twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman, who has lived with  him thirty years, is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him  and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned  off, to step into his place. He would have eighteen shillings a week at  first, a stable suit, a driving suit, a bedroom over the coachhouse, and  a boy under him. Sir Clifford is a good master, and if you could get the  place it would be a good start for you. I don't want to part with you,  and if you left us I know John would lose his right hand.\"    \"That I should, sir,\" said John, \"but I would not stand in his light for  the world.\"    \"How old are you, James?\" said master.    \"Nineteen next May, sir.\"    \"That's young; what do you think, John?\"    \"Well, sir, it is young; but he is as steady as a man, and is strong,  and well grown, and though he has not had much experience in driving, he  has a light firm hand and a quick eye, and he is very careful, and I am  quite sure no horse of his will be ruined for want of having his feet  and shoes looked after.\"    \"Your word will go the furthest, John,\" said the master, \"for Sir  Clifford adds in a postscript, 'If I could find a man trained by your  John I should like him better than any other;' so, James, lad, think it  over, talk to your mother at dinner-time, and then let me know what you  wish.\"    In a few days after this conversation it was fully settled that James  should go to Clifford Hall, in a month or six weeks, as it suited his  master, and in the meantime he was to get all the practice in driving  that could be given to him. I never knew the carriage to go out so often  before; when the mistress did not go out the master drove himself in the  two-wheeled chaise; but now, whether it was master or the young ladies,  or only an errand, Ginger and I were put in the carriage and James drove  us. At the first John rode with him on the box, telling him this and  that, and after that James drove alone.    Then it was wonderful what a number of places the master would go to in  the city on Saturday, and what queer streets we were driven through. He  was sure to go to the railway station just as the train was coming in,  and cabs and carriages, carts and omnibuses were all trying to get over  the bridge together; that bridge wanted good horses and good drivers  when the railway bell was ringing, for it was narrow, and there was a  very sharp turn up to the station, where it would not have been at all  difficult for people to run into each other, if they did not look sharp  and keep their wits about them.          15 The Old Hostler      After this it was decided by my master and mistress to pay a visit to  some friends who lived about forty-six miles from our home, and James  was to drive them. The first day we traveled thirty-two miles.  There were some long, heavy hills, but James drove so carefully and  thoughtfully that we were not at all harassed. He never forgot to put on  the brake as we went downhill, nor to take it off at the right place. He  kept our feet on the smoothest part of the road, and if the uphill was  very long, he set the carriage wheels a little across the road, so as  not to run back, and gave us a breathing. All these little things help a  horse very much, particularly if he gets kind words into the bargain.    We stopped once or twice on the road, and just as the sun was going down  we reached the town where we were to spend the night. We stopped at the  principal hotel, which was in the market-place; it was a very large one;  we drove under an archway into a long yard, at the further end of which  were the stables and coachhouses. Two hostlers came to take us out. The  head hostler was a pleasant, active little man, with a crooked leg,  and a yellow striped waistcoat. I never saw a man unbuckle harness so  quickly as he did, and with a pat and a good word he led me to a long  stable, with six or eight stalls in it, and two or three horses. The  other man brought Ginger; James stood by while we were rubbed down and  cleaned.    I never was cleaned so lightly and quickly as by that little old man.  When he had done James stepped up and felt me over, as if he thought I  could not be thoroughly done, but he found my coat as clean and smooth  as silk.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I thought I was pretty quick, and our John quicker  still, but you do beat all I ever saw for being quick and thorough at  the same time.\"    \"Practice makes perfect,\" said the crooked little hostler, \"and 'twould  be a pity if it didn't; forty years' practice, and not perfect! ha, ha!  that would be a pity; and as to being quick, why, bless you! that is  only a matter of habit; if you get into the habit of being quick it is  just as easy as being slow; easier, I should say; in fact it don't agree  with my health to be hulking about over a job twice as long as it need  take. Bless you! I couldn't whistle if I crawled over my work as some  folks do! You see, I have been about horses ever since I was twelve  years old, in hunting stables, and racing stables; and being small, ye  see, I was jockey for several years; but at the Goodwood, ye see, the  turf was very slippery and my poor Larkspur got a fall, and I broke my  knee, and so of course I was of no more use there. But I could not live  without horses, of course I couldn't, so I took to the hotels. And I  can tell ye it is a downright pleasure to handle an animal like this,  well-bred, well-mannered, well-cared-for; bless ye! I can tell how a  horse is treated. Give me the handling of a horse for twenty minutes,  and I'll tell you what sort of a groom he has had. Look at this one,  pleasant, quiet, turns about just as you want him, holds up his feet to  be cleaned out, or anything else you please to wish; then you'll find  another fidgety, fretty, won't move the right way, or starts across the  stall, tosses up his head as soon as you come near him, lays his ears,  and seems afraid of you; or else squares about at you with his heels.  Poor things! I know what sort of treatment they have had. If they are  timid it makes them start or shy; if they are high-mettled it makes them  vicious or dangerous; their tempers are mostly made when they are young.  Bless you! they are like children, train 'em up in the way they should  go, as the good book says, and when they are old they will not depart  from it, if they have a chance.\"    \"I like to hear you talk,\" said James, \"that's the way we lay it down at  home, at our master's.\"    \"Who is your master, young man? if it be a proper question. I should  judge he is a good one, from what I see.\"    \"He is Squire Gordon, of Birtwick Park, the other side the Beacon  Hills,\" said James.    \"Ah! so, so, I have heard tell of him; fine judge of horses, ain't he?  the best rider in the county.\"    \"I believe he is,\" said James, \"but he rides very little now, since the  poor young master was killed.\"    \"Ah! poor gentleman; I read all about it in the paper at the time. A  fine horse killed, too, wasn't there?\"    \"Yes,\" said James; \"he was a splendid creature, brother to this one, and  just like him.\"    \"Pity! pity!\" said the old man; \"'twas a bad place to leap, if I  remember; a thin fence at top, a steep bank down to the stream, wasn't  it? No chance for a horse to see where he is going. Now, I am for bold  riding as much as any man, but still there are some leaps that only  a very knowing old huntsman has any right to take. A man's life and a  horse's life are worth more than a fox's tail; at least, I should say  they ought to be.\"    During this time the other man had finished Ginger and had brought our  corn, and James and the old man left the stable together.          16 The Fire      Later on in the evening a traveler's horse was brought in by the second  hostler, and while he was cleaning him a young man with a pipe in his  mouth lounged into the stable to gossip.    \"I say, Towler,\" said the hostler, \"just run up the ladder into the loft  and put some hay down into this horse's rack, will you? only lay down  your pipe.\"    \"All right,\" said the other, and went up through the trapdoor; and I  heard him step across the floor overhead and put down the hay. James  came in to look at us the last thing, and then the door was locked.    I cannot say how long I had slept, nor what time in the night it was,  but I woke up very uncomfortable, though I hardly knew why. I got up;  the air seemed all thick and choking. I heard Ginger coughing and one  of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#9)"],[1,"to  Planchet that M. du Vallon would be one of the privileged travelers, and  as the plume in Porthos's hat made the wooden candles suspended over the  front jingle together, a melancholy presentiment seemed to eclipse the  delight Planchet had promised himself for the morrow. But the grocer  had a heart of gold, ever mindful of the good old times--a trait that  carries youth into old age. So Planchet, notwithstanding a sort of  internal shiver, checked as soon as experienced, received Porthos with  respect, mingled with the tenderest cordiality. Porthos, who was a  little cold and stiff in his manners at first, on account of the social  difference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer, soon  began to soften when he perceived so much good-feeling and so many kind  attentions in Planchet. He was particularly touched by the liberty which  was permitted him to plunge his great palms into the boxes of dried  fruits and preserves, into the sacks of nuts and almonds, and into the  drawers full of sweetmeats. So that, notwithstanding Planchet's pressing  invitations to go upstairs to the _entresol_, he chose as his favorite  seat, during the evening which he had to spend at Planchet's house, the  shop itself, where his fingers could always fish up whatever his nose  detected. The delicious figs from Provence, filberts from the forest,  Tours plums, were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five  consecutive hours. His teeth, like millstones, cracked heaps of nuts,  the shells of which were scattered all over the floor, where they were  trampled by every one who went in and out of the shop; Porthos pulled  from the stalk with his lips, at one mouthful, bunches of the rich  Muscatel raisins with their beautiful bloom, half a pound of which  passed at one gulp from his mouth to his stomach. In one of the corners  of the shop, Planchet's assistants, huddled together, looked at each  other without venturing to open their lips. They did not know who  Porthos was, for they had never seen him before. The race of those  Titans who had worn the cuirasses of Hugh Capet, Philip Augustus,  and Francis I. had already begun to disappear. They could hardly help  thinking he might be the ogre of the fairy tale, who was going to turn  the whole contents of Planchet's shop into his insatiable stomach, and  that, too, without in the slightest degree displacing the barrels and  chests that were in it. Cracking, munching, chewing, nibbling, sucking,  and swallowing, Porthos occasionally said to the grocer:    \"You do a very good business here, friend Planchet.\"    \"He will very soon have none at all to do, if this sort of thing  continues,\" grumbled the foreman, who had Planchet's word that he should  be his successor. In the midst of his despair, he approached Porthos,  who blocked up the whole of the passage leading from the back shop to  the shop itself. He hoped that Porthos would rise and that this movement  would distract his devouring ideas.    \"What do you want, my man?\" asked Porthos, affably.    \"I should like to pass you, monsieur, if it is not troubling you too  much.\"    \"Very well,\" said Porthos, \"it does not trouble me in the least.\"    At the same moment he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband,  lifted him off the ground, and placed him very gently on the other  side, smiling all the while with the same affable expression. As soon as  Porthos had placed him on the ground, the lad's legs so shook under him  that he fell back upon some sacks of corks. But noticing the giant's  gentleness of manner, he ventured again, and said:    \"Ah, monsieur! pray be careful.\"    \"What about?\" inquired Porthos.    \"You are positively putting a fiery furnace into your body.\"    \"How is that, my good fellow?\"    \"All those things are very heating to the system!\"    \"Which?\"    \"Raisins, nuts, and almonds.\"    \"Yes; but if raisins, nuts, and almonds are heating--\"    \"There is no doubt at all of it, monsieur.\"    \"Honey is very cooling,\" said Porthos, stretching out his hand toward  a small barrel of honey which was open, and he plunged the scoop with  which the wants of the customers were supplied into it, and swallowed a  good half-pound at one gulp.    \"I must trouble you for some water now, my man,\" said Porthos.    \"In a pail, monsieur?\" asked the lad, simply.    \"No, in a water-bottle; that will be quite enough;\" and raising the  bottle to his mouth, as a trumpeter does his trumpet, he emptied the  bottle at a single draught.    Planchet was agitated in every fibre of propriety and self-esteem.  However, a worthy representative of the hospitality which prevailed in  early days, he feigned to be talking very earnestly with D'Artagnan, and  incessantly repeated:--\"Ah! monsieur, what a happiness! what an honor!\"    \"What time shall we have supper, Planchet?\" inquired Porthos, \"I feel  hungry.\"    The foreman clasped his hands together. The two others got under the  counters, fearing Porthos might have a taste for human flesh.    \"We shall only take a sort of snack here,\" said D'Artagnan; \"and when we  get to Planchet's country-seat, we will have supper.\"    \"Ah, ah! so we are going to your country-house, Planchet,\" said Porthos;  \"so much the better.\"    \"You overwhelm me, monsieur le baron.\"    The \"monsieur le baron\" had a great effect upon the men, who detected  a personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind. This  title, too, reassured them. They had never heard that an ogre was ever  called \"monsieur le baron\".    \"I will take a few biscuits to eat on the road,\" said Porthos,  carelessly; and he emptied a whole jar of aniseed biscuits into the huge  pocket of his doublet.    \"My shop is saved!\" exclaimed Planchet.    \"Yes, as the cheese was,\" whispered the foreman.    \"What cheese?\"    \"The Dutch cheese, inside which a rat had made his way, and we found  only the rind left.\"    Planchet looked all round his shop, and observing the different articles  which had escaped Porthos's teeth, he found the comparison somewhat  exaggerated. The foreman, who remarked what was passing in his master's  mind, said, \"Take care; he is not gone yet.\"    \"Have you any fruit here?\" said Porthos, as he went upstairs to the  _entresol_, where it had just been announced that some refreshment was  prepared.    \"Alas!\" thought the grocer, addressing a look at D'Artagnan full of  entreaty, which the latter half understood.    As soon as they had finished eating they set off. It was late when the  three riders, who had left Paris about six in the evening, arrived at  Fontainebleau. The journey passed very agreeably. Porthos took a fancy  to Planchet's society, because the latter was very respectful in his  manners, and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows, his  woods, and his rabbit-warrens. Porthos had all the taste and pride of  a landed proprietor. When D'Artagnan saw his two companions in earnest  conversation, he took the opposite side of the road, and letting his  bridle drop upon his horse's neck, separated himself from the whole  world, as he had done from Porthos and from Planchet. The moon shone  softly through the foliage of the forest. The breezes of the open  country rose deliciously perfumed to the horse's nostrils, and they  snorted and pranced along delightedly. Porthos and Planchet began to  talk about hay-crops. Planchet admitted to Porthos that in the advanced  years of his life, he had certainly neglected agricultural pursuits  for commerce, but that his childhood had been passed in Picardy in the  beautiful meadows where the grass grew as high as the knees, and where  he had played under the green apple-trees covered with red-cheeked  fruit; he went on to say, that he had solemnly promised himself that as  soon as he should have made his fortune, he would return to nature, and  end his days, as he had begun them, as near as he possibly could to the  earth itself, where all men must sleep at last.    \"Eh, eh!\" said Porthos; \"in that case, my dear Monsieur Planchet, your  retirement is not far distant.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Why, you seem to be in the way of making your fortune very soon.\"    \"Well, we are getting on pretty well, I must admit,\" replied Planchet.    \"Come, tell me what is the extent of your ambition, and what is the  amount you intend to retire upon?\"    \"There is one circumstance, monsieur,\" said Planchet, without answering  the question, \"which occasions me a good deal of anxiety.\"    \"What is it?\" inquired Porthos, looking all round him as if in search of  the circumstance that annoyed Planchet, and desirous of freeing him from  it.    \"Why, formerly,\" said the grocer, \"you used to call me Planchet quite  short, and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar  manner than you do now.\"    \"Certainly, certainly, I should have said so formerly,\" replied the  good-natured Porthos, with an embarrassment full of delicacy; \"but  formerly--\"    \"Formerly I was M. d'Artagnan's lackey; is not that what you mean?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well if I am not quite his lackey, I am as much as ever I was his  devoted servant; and more than that, since that time--\"    \"Well, Planchet?\"    \"Since that time, I have had the honor of being in partnership with  him.\"    \"Oh, oh!\" said Porthos. \"What, has D'Artagnan gone into the grocery  business?\"    \"No, no,\" said D'Artagnan, whom these words had drawn out of his  reverie, and who entered into the conversation with that readiness and  rapidity which distinguished every operation of his mind and body. \"It  was not D'Artagnan who entered into the grocery business, but Planchet  who entered into a political affair with me.\"    \"Yes,\" said Planchet, with mingled pride and satisfaction, \"we  transacted a little business which brought me in a hundred thousand  francs and M. d'Artagnan two hundred thousand.\"    \"Oh, oh!\" said Porthos, with admiration.    \"So that, monsieur le baron,\" continued the grocer, \"I again beg you to  be kind "]]]
