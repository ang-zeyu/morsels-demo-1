But happening to hear some one read in a book, that it is  intelligence which is the parent of order and cause of all things, I  considered that, if it were so, the ordering intelligence placed each  thing where it was best.\"    Is mind a development upward from the instinct of the brute creation, or  is it an offspring from God? Man's reasoning intelligence separates him  from the brute by a chasm that no man can carry the reasoning powers of  mind across. _All on that side is brutish._ The science of the Bible,  dealing with intelligence as its subject, is the highest order of science  known to man. To limit the term science to physical phenomena is  unjustifiable, unless matter is the only substance in the universe, and  unless it be true, also, that some things resulting from matter lie  outside of science; for if matter is the one, and only, substance, and if  science deals with all there is, or may be, connected with that substance,  then, according to materialists themselves, its province is to deal with  life, mind and religion. But matter is not the only substance, unless a  thing can be, exist, and not be at the same time; for if life is a  property of matter inertia is not, and if mind is a property of matter it  must be with all matter everywhere, or the thing is and is not at one and  the same time.    The mind, in all its faculties, lies outside of the domain of the physical  sciences. Each man gets his knowledge of his own mental and moral  self-hood, not through the senses, but by his consciousness. So there is a  mental science that looks inward, and a physical science that looks  outward. Break down consciousness and philosophy is ruined. But some  ignoramus is ready to say: What care I for philosophy? Poor fellow! He  does not know what philosophy is; his ignorance is his trouble. Philosophy  simply tells us _how things are_; it answers the question, _how is it_?  There is nothing in which we are more interested than we are in the _how  is it_? Let us not ruin philosophy; consciousness is her foundation with  us; for in order to knowledge there must be primary and intuitive beliefs;  the man who has no faith in his own ability to see truth, when it is  presented through the medium of the senses, will never come to any  definite conclusions about any thing. So mind is innate, and lies in  consciousness, or self-hood, and is at the bottom of all our knowledge;  otherwise we would not, and could not, be men.    Mind is above matter, and virtue and morals are above both in their  results. The certainties are not all confined to physical nature, and  hence science should not be. Personality and the freedom of the will,  possessed in consciousness, are as certain as any facts in the physical  world. Truth, justice, right and wrong are equally certain.            WAS IT POSSIBLE?      The miracle of the sun and the moon standing still in the days of Joshua  is urged as contrary to the philosophy of nature, and therefore untrue.  That which is simply above the ordinary is not necessarily contrary to the  ordinary. The objection is without value until it be proven that there is  no God; for it is in his power to control the planets. Otherwise he is not  omnipotent. On this very account, it is true, that there is no consistent  ground between Christianity and atheism; for the moment we admit the  existence of God, that moment we concede the existence of the power  adequate to the accomplishment of all the miracles of the Bible. Joshua  went to the aid of the Gibeonites against the confederate kings; went up  to Gilgal _all night_, and came instantaneously upon the enemy; having  thrown them into confusion with great slaughter, and chased them from  Gibeon to Beth-horon, in a westerly direction, the Lord co-operating in  their destruction by a great hail-storm, which slew more than the swords  of the Israelites, but touched not the Israelites. In this situation of  things the sun appears over Gibeon eastward and the moon over Ajalon  westward. When Joshua saw it, moved by a grand impulse, he said: \"_Sun_,  stand thou still over Gibeon; and thou, moon, over the valley of Ajalon.\"  See Joshua 10: 1 to 28.    The entire machinery of nature is no more in the hands of an Omnipotent  God than a clock or watch in the hands of a man. How absurd it is for a  man, who believes in God's existence, to be emptying out his wicked  ridicule, the result of his ignorance or otherwise, of his dishonesty,  upon this miracle? Is not God above his laws? Can not he manipulate, take  hold of and handle the laws of nature?    It is claimed that the miracle was contrary to the philosophy of nature.  _God out_, it would be true, but _God in_, it is not. It is conceded by  the best of minds that the Bible is in perfect accord with the Newtonian  system; that the sun is the center of the solar system; and the earth, and  all other planets, move round the sun in certain periodical times; that  the sun revolves around his own axis, and round the common center of  gravity included in his own surface; that the solar influence is the  _cause_ of the annual and diurnal motions of the earth, and that the  motions of the earth must continue while the solar influence continues to  act upon it; that no power but that of Jehovah can change this solar  influence; that he can suspend the operation of this influence; that he  can and does manipulate--handle the laws which he has established--whenever  his wisdom sees proper. It would be degrading to allow that the Almighty  One threw this universe of his under laws over which he has no controlling  power.    The miracle wrought upon this occasion was altogether worthy of God.  Joshua spoke as if he knew all about the effect of the solar influence  upon our planet; it is this influence that gives to our earth its diurnal  motion, and the arresting of this influence would arrest the motion of the  earth and the day would be lengthened out.    It is objected that if the sun should stand still one moment everything  upon the earth would be swept from existence. It is the objection that is  at fault, for there is no evidence that it was an instantaneous miracle. A  few seconds is all that is necessary when a carriage is in rapid motion to  enable its occupants to light out with perfect safety when an  instantaneous pause would hurl them over the dash. At the equator the  rotation of the earth is at the rate of fourteen hundred and twenty-six  feet per second; twelve hundred and twelve feet at Jerusalem. It is the  speed of a ball at the moment of leaving a cannon's mouth, discharged by  one-fifth of its own weight of powder. This power is allowed to be  sufficient to elevate its ball to the height of twenty-four thousand feet,  deducting the effect of atmospheric resistance. Yet a child of six summers  could destroy all this force by the elastic and continued action of its  fingers inside of two-thirds of a minute. This last objection is entirely  worthless until it be shown that the miracle under consideration was  instantaneous, for eighteen minutes is time enough to stop, gradually, our  planet in its motion, so effectually that you would not feel that anything  had happened. \"The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28075"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, March, 1880 (#9)"],[1," were under his  control he was more than human. If he rose from the dead he was the Son of  God. Did he rise? This is a question upon which the whole Christian scheme  hinges. What was the nature of the fact? Was it one about which men could  be mistaken? Was it a fact which, occurring, addressed itself to the  senses? If it was the witnesses could not be mistaken. There is not a  court in the universe that would allow it.    There are things about which wise men may be mistaken, but they are not  things which address themselves to the senses. Those are things in which  fools may not, can not, be mistaken. It is impossible for my wife to be  mistaken about my presence at this moment, but it is just as possible as  it was for any of the first witnesses of Christ's resurrection to be  mistaken. They were not, they could not be mistaken. Then what becomes of  Strauss's mythical idea. What folly it is to allow that those witnesses  were perfectly honest, enthusiastically and proverbially honest in all  they said, and yet mistaken.    This moral honesty and enthusiasm which Strauss and others allow to the  credit of the witnesses is undoubtedly designed as a feeler--a mere  catering to the views of Christians upon the character of the first  Christians. Very good fellows (?) after all. How is that? If one of my  neighbors would go into a court room to-morrow and testify under oath that  he was with me yesterday, and the court was in possession of the fact that  I was not with him, or near him at all, would it allow honesty to the  witness? Would not every sensible man say, in his heart, he is a perjured  witness? If he was with Walker he knew it; and if he was not with him he  knew it.    Gentlemen, exercise all your shrewdness, adopt Strauss's idea of a  mythical origin of the gospel of Christ, both as respects his miracles,  which were either seen or not seen, and as respects his resurrection, then  spread the blanket of honesty and warm-hearted enthusiasm over those men  who sacrificed everything, life not excepted, for the testimony which they  bore, and the next day any well-instructed judge of our courts would say,  it is nonsense; they could not be mistaken about any fact which addressed  itself to their eyes and ears. Christ rose from the dead if the witnesses  told the truth; and the witnesses told the truth if they were honest men;  and if they were not honest, labor, toil, suffering and martyrdom are no  evidences of sincerity.                              -------------------------------------            Can you believe in harmony without believing in a harmonist?    Can you believe that all things in nature adjusted themselves to each  other?    Can you believe that life, and mind, and moral nature, each and all came  from where neither existed?            MISCELLANEOUS.      Voltaire built a church to God at Ferney.    Can you believe that your great ancestors were apes?    Do you oppose the Bible and prefer its legitimate effects?    Huxley wants the Bible introduced into boarding schools.    Can you believe in design without believing in a designer?    Tyndal says the theory of evolution of species is utterly uncredited.    Can you believe that the type which made these letters set themselves up?    The _Saturday Review_ says Hume used to go to church sometimes in  Scotland.    Can you believe that mind is the result of blind, unintelligent,  mechanical forces?    Tyndal says spontaneous generation is the one essential pillar of  evolution of species.    Tyndal says the failures to produce spontaneous life by experimenting are  lamentable.    Collins insisted on his servants going to church \"that they might not rob  or murder him.\"    Can you believe that worlds hung themselves together and move themselves,  as one grand whole, through space?    Can you believe that the correllation of things in nature was without  design? that such adaptations as light to the eye was unintended?    Can you be honest in exerting your influence against the religion of Jesus  Christ while it is your candid conviction that a country is better off  with it than without it?    Do you sometimes say you prefer to live where there are churches and  Sunday-schools, and all their appliances for the bettering of the  condition of humanity, and at the same time constantly find fault with the  Bible and religion which creates such things? If such is your course, are  you strictly honest?"]]]
