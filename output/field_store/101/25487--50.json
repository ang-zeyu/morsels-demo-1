One certainly  saves a lot of bother when one discards it from one's repertoire. If  these four pieces are not the most difficult pieces, they are certainly  among the most difficult.      WHY NOT SEEK THE BEAUTIFUL?    \"But why seek difficulty when there is so much that is quite as  beautiful and yet not difficult? Why try to make a bouquet of oak trees  when the ground is covered with exquisite flowers? The piano is a solo  instrument and has its limitations. Some piano music is said to sound  orchestral. As a matter of fact, a great deal of it would sound better  with the orchestra.    \"Real piano music is rare. The piano appears to be too small for some of  our modern Titans among the composers. When they write for the piano  they seem to be exhibiting a concealed longing for the one hundred or  more men of the modern orchestra. One of the reasons why the works of  Debussy appeal to me is that he manages to put so much color into his  piano pieces without suggesting the orchestra. Much of his music is  wonderful in this respect, and, moreover, the musicians of the future  will appreciate this fact more and more.      EXERCISES THAT GIVE IMMEDIATE HELP    \"No one exercise can be depended upon to meet all the varied conditions  which arise in the practice of the day, but I have frequently employed a  simple exercise which seems to 'coax' the hand into muscular activity in  a very short time. It is so simple that I am diffident about suggesting  it. However, elemental processes lead to large structures sometimes.  The Egyptian pyramids were built ages before the age of steam and  electricity, and scientists are still wondering how those massive stones  were ever put in place.    \"The exercise I use most, apart from scales, is really based upon a  principle which is constantly employed in all scale playing and in all  piano playing, that of putting the thumb over and under the fingers. Did  you ever stop to think how continually this is employed? One hardly goes  one step beyond the elemental grades before one encounters it. It  demands a muscular action entirely different from that of pressing down  the keys either with the finger, forearm or arm motion.    \"Starting with the above-named principle and devising new exercises to  meet the very human need for variety, I play something like this:    [Illustration]    \"The next form would employ another fingering--    [Illustration]    \"The next form might be--    [Illustration]    \"These I transpose through several keys, for instance--    [Illustration]    \"Note that I am not giving an arbitrary exercise, but simply suggesting  the plan upon which the student may work. There is a great deal of fun  in devising new exercises. It assists in helping the student to  concentrate. Of course, these exercises are only attempted after all the  standard exercises found in books have been exhausted.      AVOID TOO COMPLICATED EXERCISES    \"I often think that teachers make a great mistake by giving too  complicated exercises. A complicated exercise leads away from clear  thinking and concentration. The simple exercise will never seem dull or  dry if the pupil's ambition is right. After all, it is not so much what  is done as how it is done. Give less thought to the material and more to  the correction of the means with which one plays. There should be  unceasing variety in studies. A change at every practice period is  advisable, as it gives the pupil new material for thought. There are  hundreds of different exercises in the different books, and the student  has no reason for suffering for want of variety.\"      QUESTIONS IN STYLE, INTERPRETATION, EXPRESSION  AND TECHNIC OF PIANOFORTE PLAYING    SERIES II    WILHELM BACHAUS    1.

His father was  an accomplished amateur violinist. Through him, the future virtuoso was  enabled to gain an excellent idea of the beautiful literature of chamber  music. When a boy Mr. Bauer studied privately with the celebrated violin  teacher, Politzer. At the age of ten he became so proficient that he  made his _debut_ as a violinist in London. Thereafter in his tours of  England he met with great success everywhere.    In the artistic circles of London Mr. Bauer met a musician named Graham  Moore, who gave him some idea upon the details of the technic of  pianoforte playing, which Mr. Bauer had studied or rather \"picked up\" by  himself, without any thought of ever abandoning his career as a  violinist. Mr. Moore had expected to rehearse some orchestral  accompaniments on a second piano with Paderewski, who was then preparing  some concertos for public performance. Mr. Moore was taken ill and sent  his talented musical friend, Mr. Bauer, in his place. Paderewski  immediately took an interest in his talented accompanist and advised him  to go to Paris to continue his studies with Gorski.    After many privations in Paris Mr. Bauer, unable to secure engagements  as a violinist, went on a tour of Russia as an accompanist of a singer.  In some of the smaller towns Bauer played an occasional piano solo.  Returning to Paris, he found that he was still unable to secure  engagements as a violinist. His pianistic opportunity came when a  celebrated virtuoso who was to play at a concert was taken ill and Bauer  was asked to substitute. He gradually gave more attention to the piano  and rose to a very high position in the tone world.          V    ARTISTIC ASPECTS OF PIANO STUDY    HAROLD BAUER      THE IMMEDIATE RELATION OF TECHNIC TO MUSIC    \"While it gives me great pleasure to talk to the great number of  students studying the piano, I can assure you that it is with no little  diffidence that I venture to approach these very subjects about which  they are probably most anxious to learn. In the first place, words tell  very little, and in the second place, my whole career has been so  different from the orthodox methods that I have been constantly  compelled to contrive means of my own to meet the myriads of artistic  contingencies as they have arisen in my work. It is largely for this  reason that I felt compelled recently to refuse a very flattering offer  to write a book on piano playing. My whole life experience makes me  incapable of perceiving what the normal methods of pianistic study  should be. As a result of this I am obliged with my own pupils to invent  continually new means and new plans for work with each student.    \"Without the conventional technical basis to work upon, this has  necessarily resulted in several aspects of pianoforte study which are  naturally somewhat different from the commonly accepted ideas of the  technicians. In the first place, the only technical study of any kind I  have ever done has been that technic which has had an immediate relation  to the musical message of the piece I have been studying. In other  words, I have never studied technic independently of music. I do not  condemn the ordinary technical methods for those who desire to use them  and see good in them. I fear, however, that I am unable to discuss them  adequately, as they are outside of my personal experience.      THE AIM OF TECHNIC    \"When, as a result of circumstances entirely beyond my control, I  abandoned the study of the violin in order to become a pianist, I was  forced to realize, in view of my very imperfect technical equipment,  that in order to take advantage of the opportunities that offered for  public performance it would be necessary for me to find some means of  making my playing acceptable without spending months and probably years  in acquiring mechanical proficiency. The only way of overcoming the  difficulty seemed to be to devote myself entirely to the musical  essentials of the composition I was interpreting in the hope that the  purely technical deficiencies which I had neither time nor knowledge to  enable me to correct would pass comparatively unnoticed, provided I was  able to give sufficient interest and compel sufficient attention to the  emotional values of the work. This kind of study, forced upon me in the  first instance through reasons of expediency, became a habit, and  gradually grew into a conviction that it was a mistake to practice  technic at all unless such practice should conduce to some definite,  specific and immediate musical result.    \"I do not wish to be misunderstood in making this statement, containing,  as it does, an expression of opinion that was formed in early years of  study, but which, nevertheless, I have never since felt any reason to  change. It is not my intention to imply that technical study is  unnecessary, or that purely muscular training is to be neglected. I mean  simply to say that in every detail of technical work the germ of musical  expression must be discovered and cultivated, and that in muscular  training for force and independence the simplest possible forms of  physical exercises are all that is necessary.    \"The singer and the violinist are always studying _music_, even when  they practice a succession of single notes. Not so with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28039"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II (#9)"],[1," bill, was Senator Henry Wilson), but it was decided to  place the Bureau in the War Department, with a military man at the  head, Mrs. Griffing being appointed \"Assistant Commissioner.\" She  really held the position but a few weeks--in name, five months--a  second military officer standing ready to take the appointment, as men  have ever done, and as they will always crowd women aside so long as  they are held political inferiors, without the citizen's charter to  sustain their claim. This officer had the title and drew the pay,  while our noble friend went on as before in her arduous and almost  superhuman labors. The Bureau adopted _her_ plan of finding homes in  the North, sending the freedmen at Government charge, and of opening  employment offices in New York City and in Providence, R. I.;  nevertheless it was necessary to supplement Government provision by  private generosity; and moreover, that Congress should provide  temporary relief for the helpless in the District. Appropriations were  made in sums of $25,000, amounting in all to nearly $200,000, for the  purchase of supplies, a very large proportion of which were  distributed by Mrs. Griffing in person from her own residence.[27]  \"Shirley Dare,\" in writing to _The New York World_, after a little  time spent with Mrs. G., said:         \"I sat an hour this morning in Mrs. Griffing's office during the       distribution of rations, and a curious scene it was. There was       not a sound creature among the crowd which filled the yard, and       which hangs about all day from nine till four, and which the       neighborhood calls 'Mrs. Griffing's signs.' It reminded me of       another crowd of impotent folk, lame, halt, and blind, which       filled the loveliest space in Jerusalem, and was a _sign_ of joy       and charity in the place. Queer, tender, wistful faces, so       earnest one forgets their grotesque character and ragged, faded       forms, cluster in the porch; such a set as one might once have       seen put up at auction as a 'refuse lot' of plantation negroes.       The men wear old army cloaks, while the women, with dresses in       every stage of decay, are so comic, one struggles between the       ludicrous and the pitiful.... The faith of this class seems to be       fastened nowhere so strongly as upon Mrs. Griffing. Salutations       follow her along the streets, enough to satisfy the proudest       Pharisee, and it provokes one between a smile and a tear, to see       the women waiting timidly, yet eagerly, for a word from her, to       set their faces all aglow. They used to say, persistently, 'We       belongs to you,' and no efforts could induce them to change that       phrase. 'Who has we but the Lord and you?' was the simple       argument which stayed protest from the kind, proud woman who was       their benefactress. A few words from her will draw out histories       simple, funny, and sad beyond question.\"    Our friend had a strong belief that the able in body could sustain  themselves if labor were provided, which it could not be there, so she  urged them to go to the North, which greatly needed laborers to fill  the places of Northern men in the army. Woman's help, too, was as much  in demand, for in many places large farms were wholly managed by women  in the absence of husbands and sons; but it was learned by Mrs.  Griffing and daughters through repeated testimony, that the life-long  teaching of the slaves had been, that no good could come from  Northern people,[28] and this led the many in their pitiable ignorance  to believe that, somewhere in the North, the monsters surely lived who  were waiting to destroy them, and that the kind few whom they had met  were of a different race; that \"the North\" was beyond the sea, and  they could never return, nor hear from their friends left behind; so  persistent argument was needed to convince the most ignorant of their  false notions, and many of them never were, until some had gone and  returned with good tidings. The first company prepared to go numbered  sixty persons, for whom Mrs. Griffing procured Government  transportation and a day's rations. She went with them to New York  City, and as they passed from the cars the sight was a new and strange  one. Filing through the streets, the anxious, wondering women dressed  partly in neat garments given them, with others of their own selection  in less good taste; while on the men an occasional damaged silk hat  topped off a coat that would have made Joseph's of old look plain;  with ironclad army shoes; or a half-worn wedding swallow-tail, eked  out by a plantation broad-brim, and boots too much worn for either  comfort or beauty. This motley band, led by a gentle and  spiritual-faced woman, will not soon be forgotten by those who saw it  depart. Leaving a few at one depot, and a few at another, to be met at  the journey's end by their employer, Mrs. Griffing took those  remaining to Providence, near which place homes had been provided.  After these sent messages back to friends, others went more readily,  and during a little more than two years over seven thousand freed  people left Washington under Mrs. Griffing's special supervision and  direction for homes in the North. I wish I could say how many parties  she actually convoyed on the journey, and how many miles she traveled,  but I know that she went as far as New York with a great many; and as  I have seen them start, knew and felt that it was too much for her,  and longed that some stronger person should appear to share her  burdens, and relieve her from these exhausting duties. Perhaps she had  written letters till twelve o'clock the night before; had taken a long  walk beyond the Navy-Yard cars, in the afternoon, to visit her  centenarians; or had received calls, and talked till her voice had  almost given out.    But she had the comfort of knowing that many remained where they had  been sent, some buying homes and planting vines about the roof-tree.  To behold this, she had wrought heroically in the past for  emancipation. She was busy with her hands, busier with her brain, and  her spiritual nature was like a spring of sweet waters, overflowing in  bounteous blessing on all around. Of the great painter Leonardo da  Vinci, his biographer says: \"He always saw four things he wanted to do  at once.\" Our friend always saw many more. Her mind was teeming not  only with ideals as beautiful as those of the great artist, but with  practical plans to educate the ignorant, and lift them to self-support  and self-protection. Her being was instinct with constructive and  spiritual force.    It would be hard to find any sphere of woman's activity in which she  had not been leader. Believing that \"the manifest intention of nature  is the perfection of man,\" she faithfully did her part. In the  laborious and the menial she served the colored poor, while she  neglected no opportunity to open their spiritual vision. She fed,  warmed, and clothed them; ministered to the sick; attended the dying;  procured their coffins; spoke the comforting words, and sung the hymns  at their funerals. She instructed them in their Sunday meetings, and  gained release for those in prison for petty offences, or for those  unjustly accused. Soldiers often appealed to her to assist and aid  them. Her work at the jails was very wearing, for the poor creatures,  not unfrequently the mother of an infant left at home, arrested for an  imaginary offense, or for _stealing_ bread to avert starvation, would  _plead_ so hard for her to get them released, and had such full faith  that she could, that it was a constant tax upon her sympathy and  strength, as was all her work connected with them.    Josephine Griffing had to deal too much with the realities of life and  death to make many records of her work, save those required in the  routine of her office. These were mostly kept by her daughter Emma,  her official assistant. But the substance of what was done in these  years may be found in the archives of the Government. On the calendar  of both Houses of Congress, in the _Congressional Globe_, in the War  Office, in the Freedman's Bureau, in the offices of District  Government and District Courts, and perhaps in the prisons, the future  historian may find abundant records of the patient and humane labors  of this merciful, vigilant, and untiring woman. Whether he finds them  in her name is not so certain!    Mrs. Griffing not only devoted to these people the six days of the  week allotted to labor, but her Sundays were given to public  ministrations as well as private visits to the distant and aged,  unable to come to the Relief rooms during the week. But for a real  picture of the condition of these people, nothing can be more graphic  or full of feeling, than her own account in a letter to Lucretia  Mott,[29] intended as an appeal to the Society of Friends in  Philadelphia. It, with others, had early responded, and with its  contributions in part, she had established the soup-houses before  noted. Her account is also in connection with the Bureau, of  historical interest. During this long struggle her evenings were spent  in writing letters to the North, framing bills, petitions, and appeals  to amend the laws of the District. As she was interested in all the  reforms of the day, she was frequently called upon for active service  in conventions and political gatherings.    Of the public men whom she consulted, two at least, I know, made  everybody and everything yield when she appeared; these were Secretary  Stanton and Chas. Sumner--so interested were they in the objects of  her devotion, and so sure that Mrs. Griffing would not take their time  without sufficient reason. Benj. F. Wade and Henry Wilson would not  yield the palm in their respect to her, and Senator Howard, of  Michigan, was also one of her most friendly helpers.
