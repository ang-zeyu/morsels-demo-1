An illustration  in a book! But which book, when? Not recently, and it was not a pattern  known to his own people.    Twisted into the interior of the jacket was a silklike scarf, clear,  light blue--the blue of Terra's cloudless skies on certain days, so  different from the yellow shield now hanging above them. A small case of  leather, with silhouetted designs cut from hide and affixed to it,  designs as intricate and complex as the embroidery on the jacket--art of  a high standard. In the case a knife and spoon, the bowl and blade of  dull metal, the handles of horn carved with horse heads, the tiny  wide-open eyes set with glittering stones.    Personal possessions dear to the owner, so that when they must be  abandoned for flight they were hidden with some hope of recovery. Travis  slowly repacked them, trying to fold the garments into their original  creases. He was still puzzled by those designs.    \"Who?\" Tsoay touched the edge of the jacket with one finger, his  admiration for it plain to read.    \"I don't know. But it is of our own world.\"    \"That is a deer, though the horns are wrong,\" Tsoay agreed. \"And the  puma is very well done. The one who made this knows animals well.\"    Travis pushed the jacket back into the bag and laced it shut. But he did  not return it to the hiding place. Instead, he made it a part of his own  pack. If they did not succeed in running down the fugitive, he wanted an  opportunity for closer study, a chance to remember just where he had  seen that picture before.    The narrow valley where they had discovered the bag sloped upward, and  there were signs that their quarry found the ground harder to cover. The  second discard lay in open sight--again a leather bag which Nalik'ideyu  sniffed and then began to lick eagerly, thrusting her nose into its  flaccid interior.    Travis picked it up, finding it damp to the touch. It had an odd smell,  like that of sour milk. He ran a finger around inside, brought it out  wet; yet this was neither water bag nor canteen. And he was completely  mystified when he turned it inside out, for though the inner surface was  wet, the bag was empty. He offered it to the coyote, and she took it  promptly.    Holding it firmly to the earth with her forepaws, she licked the  surface, though Travis could see no deposit which might attract her. It  was clear that the bag had once held some sort of food.    \"Here they rested,\" Tsoay said. \"Not too far ahead now--\"    But now they were in the kind of country where a man could hide in order  to check on his back trail. Travis studied the terrain and then made his  own plans. They would leave the plainly marked trace of the fugitive,  strike out upslope to the east and try to parallel the other's route. In  that maze of rock outcrops and wood copses there was tricky going.    Nalik'ideyu gave a last lick to the bag as Travis signaled her. She  regarded him, then turned her head to survey the country before them. At  last she trotted on, her buff coat melting into the vegetation. With  Naginlta she would scout the quarry and keep watch, leaving the men to  take the longer way around.    Travis pulled off his shirt, folding it into a packet and tucking it  beneath the folds of his sash-belt, just as his ancestors had always  done before a fight. Then he cached his pack and Tsoay's. As they began  the stiff climb they carried only their bows, the quivers slung on their  shoulders, and the long-bladed knives. But they flitted like shadows  and, like the coyotes, their red-brown bodies became indistinguishable  against the bronze of the land.    They should be, Travis judged, not more than an hour away from sundown.  And they had to locate the stranger before the dark closed in. His  respect for their quarry had grown. The unknown might have been driven  by fear, but he held to a good pace and headed intelligently for just  the kind of country which would serve him best. If Travis could only  remember where he had seen the like of that embroidery! It had a  meaning which might be important now....    Tsoay slipped behind a wind-gnarled tree and disappeared. Travis stooped  under a line of bush limbs. Both were working their way south, using the  peak ahead as an agreed landmark, pausing at intervals to examine the  landscape for any hint of a man and horse.    Travis squirmed snake fashion into an opening between two rock pillars  and lay there, the westering sun hot on his bare shoulders and back, his  chin propped on his forearm. In the band holding back his hair he had  inserted some concealing tufts of wiry mountain grass, the ends of which  drooped over his rugged features.    Only seconds earlier he had caught that fragmentary warning from one of  the coyotes. What they sought was very close, it was right down there.  Both animals were in ambush, awaiting orders. And what they found was  familiar, another confirmation that the fugitive was Terran, not native  to Topaz.    With searching eyes, Travis examined the site indicated by the coyotes.  His respect for the stranger was raised another notch. In time either he  or Tsoay might have sighted that hideaway without the aid of the animal  scouts; on the other hand, they might have failed. For the fugitive had  truly gone to earth, using some pocket or crevice in the mountain wall.    There was no sign of the horse, but a branch here and there had been  pulled out of place, the scars of their removal readable when one knew  where to look. Odd, Travis began to puzzle over what he saw. It was  almost as if whatever pursuit the stranger feared would come not at  ground level but from above; the precautions the stranger had taken were  to veil his retreat to the reaches of the mountain side.    Had he expected any trailer to make a flanking move from up that slope  where the Apaches now lay? Travis' teeth nipped the weathered skin of  his forearm. Could it be that at some time during the day's journeying  the fugitive had doubled back, having seen his trackers? But there had  been no traces of any such scouting, and the coyotes would surely have  warned them. Human eyes and ears could be tricked, but Travis trusted  the senses of Naginlta and Nalik'ideyu far above his own.    No, he did not believe that the rider expected the Apaches. But the man  did expect someone or something which would come upon him from the  heights. The heights.... Travis rolled his head slightly to look at the  upper reaches of the hills about him--with suspicion.    In their own journey across the mountains and through the pass they had  found nothing threatening. Dangerous animals might roam there. There had  been some paw marks, one such trail the coyotes had warned against. But  the type of precautions the stranger had taken were against intelligent,  thinking beings, not against animals more likely to track by scent than  by sight.    And if the stranger expected an attack from above, then Travis and Tsoay  must be alert. Travis analyzed each feature of the hillside, setting in  his mind a picture of every inch of ground they must cross. Just as he  had wanted daylight as an ally before, so now was he willing to wait for  the shadows of twilight.    He closed his eyes in a final check, able to recall the details of the  hiding place, knowing that he could reach it when the conditions  favored, without mistake. Then he edged back from his vantage point, and  raising his fingers to his lips, made a small angry chittering, three  times repeated. One of the species inhabiting these heights, as they had  noted earlier, was a creature about as big as the palm of a man's hand,  resembling nothing so much as a round ball of ruffled feathers, though  its covering might actually have been a silky, fluffy fur. Its short  legs could cover ground at an amazing speed, and it had the bold  impudence of a creature with few natural enemies. This was its usual  cry.    Tsoay's hand waved Travis on to where the younger man had taken position  behind the bleached trunk of a fallen tree.    \"He hides,\" Tsoay whispered.    \"Against trouble from above.\" Travis added his own observation.    \"But not us, I think.\"    So Tsoay had come to that conclusion too? Travis tried to gauge the  nearness of twilight. There was a period after the passing of Topaz' sun  when the dusky light played odd tricks with shadows. That would be the  first time for their move. He said as much, and Tsoay nodded eagerly.  They sat with their backs to a boulder, the tree trunk serving as a  screen, and chewed methodically on ration tablets. There was energy and  sustenance in the tasteless squares which would support men, even though  their stomachs continued to demand the satisfaction of fresh meat.    Taking turns, they dozed a little. But the last banners of Topaz' sun  were still in the sky when Travis judged the shadows cover enough. He  had no way of knowing how the stranger was armed. Though he used a horse  for transportation, he might well carry a rifle and the most modern  Terran sidearms.    The Apaches' bows were little use for infighting, but they had their  knives. However, Travis wanted to take the fugitive unharmed if he  could. There was information he must have. So he did not even draw his  knife as he started downhill.    When he reached a pool of violet dusk at the bottom of the small ravine  Naginlta's eyes regarded him knowingly. Travis signaled with his hand  and thought out what would be the coyotes' part in this surprise attack.  The prick-eared silhouette vanished. Uphill the chitter of a fluff-fur  sounded twice--Tsoay was in position.    A howl ... wailing ... sobbing ... was heard, one of the keening songs  of the _mba'a_. Travis darted forward. He heard the nicker of a  frightened horse, a clicking which could have marked the pawing of hoof  on gravel, saw the brush hiding the stranger's hole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25555"],[0,"Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen (#9)"],[1,"in the sea, but as  I cannot see to the bottom there is no use looking.\"    The fish said, \"Fortunately I have just met a pike, wearing a gold  ring on his fin. Just wait a moment, will you?\"    In a very short time he reappeared with the pike and the ring. The  pike willingly gave up the jewel.    The king thanked George for his cleverness, and then told him the  third task. \"If you really wish me to give the hand of my daughter  with the golden hair to the monarch who has sent you here, you must  bring me two things that I want above everything: the Water of Death  and the Water of Life.\"    George had not the least idea where to find these waters, so he  determined to trust to chance and \"follow his nose,\" as the saying is.  He went first in one direction and then in another, until he reached a  dark forest.    \"Ah, if my little ravens were but here, perhaps they would help me,\"  he said aloud.    Suddenly there was heard a rushing noise, as of wings overhead, and  then down came the ravens calling \"Krak, krak, here we are, ready and  willing to help you. What are you looking for?\"    \"I want some of the Water of Death and the Water of Life: it is  impossible for me to find them, for I don't know where to look.\"    \"Krak, krak, we know very well where to find some. Wait a moment.\"    Off they went immediately, but soon returned, each with a small gourd  in his beak. One gourd contained the Water of Life, the other the  Water of Death.    George was delighted with his success, and went back on his way to the  palace. When nearly out of the forest, he saw a spider's web hanging  between two fir trees, while in the centre was a large spider  devouring a fly he had just killed. George sprinkled a few drops of  the Water of Death on the spider; it immediately left the fly, which  rolled to the ground like a ripe cherry, but on being touched with the  Water of Life she began to move, and stretching out first one limb and  then another, gradually freed herself from the spider's web. Then she  spread her wings and took flight, having first buzzed these words in  the ears of her deliverer: \"George, you have assured your own  happiness by restoring mine, for without my help you would never have  succeeded in recognising the Princess with the Golden Hair when you  choose her to-morrow from among her twelve sisters.\"    And the fly was right, for though the king, on finding that George had  accomplished the third task, agreed to give him his daughter Zlato  Vlaska, he yet added that he would have to find her himself.    He then led him to a large room and bade him choose from among the  twelve charming girls who sat at a round table. Each wore a kind of  linen head-dress that completely hid the upper part of the head, and  in such a way that the keenest eye could not discover the colour of  the hair.    \"Here are my daughters,\" said the king, \"but only one among them has  golden hair. If you find her you may take her with you; but if you  make a mistake she will remain with us, and you will have to return  empty-handed.\"    George felt much embarrassed, not knowing what course to take.    \"Buzz, Buzz, come walk round these young girls, and I will tell you  which is yours.\"    Thus spoke the fly whose life George had saved.    Thus reassured he walked boldly round, pointing at them one after the  other and saying, \"This one has not the golden hair, nor this one  either, nor this....\"    Suddenly, having been told by the fly, he cried, \"Here we are: this is  Zlato Vlaska, even she herself. I take her for my own, she whom I have  won, and for whom I have paid the price with many cares. You will not  refuse her me this time.\"    \"Indeed, you have guessed aright,\" replied the king.    The princess rose from her seat, and letting fall her head-dress,  exposed to full view all the splendour of her wonderful hair, which  seemed like a waterfall of golden rays, and covered her from head to  foot. The glorious light that shone from it dazzled the young man's  eyes, and he immediately fell in love with her.    The king provided his daughter with gifts worthy of a queen, and she  left her father's palace in a manner befitting a royal bride. The  journey back was accomplished without any mishaps.    On their arrival the old king was delighted at the sight of Zlato  Vlaska, and danced with joy. Splendid and costly preparations were  made for the wedding. His majesty then said to George, \"You robbed me  of the secret of animal language. For this I intended to have your  head cut off and your body thrown to birds of prey. But as you have  served me so faithfully and won the princess for my bride I will  lessen the punishment--that is, although you will be executed, yet you  shall be buried with all the honours worthy of a superior officer.\"    So the sentence was carried out, cruelly and unjustly. After the  execution the Princess with the Golden Hair begged the king to make  her a present of George's body, and the monarch was so much in love  that he could not refuse his intended bride anything.    Zlato Vlaska with her own hands replaced the head on the body, and  sprinkled it with the Water of Death. Immediately the separated parts  became one again. Upon this she poured the Water of Life, and George  returned to life, fresh as a young roebuck, his face radiant with  health and youth.    \"Ah me! How well I have slept,\" said he, rubbing his eyes.    \"Yes; no one could have slept better,\" answered the princess, smiling,  \"but without me you would have slept through eternity.\"    [Illustration]    When the old king saw George restored to life, and looking younger,  handsomer, and more vigorous than ever, he too wanted to be made young  again. He therefore ordered his servants to cut off his head and  sprinkle it with the Life-Giving Water. They cut it off, but he did  not come to life again, although they sprinkled his body with all the  water that was left. Perhaps they made some mistake in using the wrong  water, for the head and body were joined, but life itself never  returned, there being no Water of Life left for that purpose. No one  knew where to get any, and none understood the language of animals.    So, to make a long story short, George was proclaimed king, and the  Princess with Hair of Gold, who really loved him, became his queen.          THE JOURNEY TO THE SUN AND THE MOON          [Illustration]    THE JOURNEY TO THE SUN AND THE MOON      There were once two young people who loved each other dearly. The  young man was called Jean, the girl, Annette. In her sweetness she was  like unto a dove, in her strength and bravery she resembled an eagle.    Her father was a rich farmer, and owned a large estate, but Jean's  father was only a poor mountain shepherd. Annette did not in the least  mind her lover being poor, for he was rich in goodness: nor did she  think her father would object to their marrying.    One day Jean put on his best clothes, and went to ask the farmer for  his daughter's hand. The farmer listened without interrupting him, and  then replied, \"If you would marry Annette, go and ask of the Sun why  he does not warm the night as well as the day. Then inquire of the  Moon why she does not shine by day as well as by night. When you  return with these answers you shall not only have my daughter but all  my wealth.\"    These conditions in no way daunted Jean, who placed his hat on the  side of his head, and taking a loving farewell of Annette, set out in  search of the Sun. On reaching a small town at the close of day, he  looked about for a place wherein to pass the night. Some kind people  offered him shelter and invited him to sup with them, inquiring as to  the object of his journey. When they heard that he was on his way to  visit the Sun and Moon, the master of the house begged him to ask the  Sun why the finest pear-tree they had in the town had, for several  years, ceased to bear fruit, for it used to produce the most delicious  pears in the world.    Jean willingly promised to make this inquiry, and the next day  continued his journey.    He walked on and on, over mountain and moor, through valley and dense  forest, until he came to a land where there was no drinking water. The  inhabitants, when they heard the object of Jean's journey, begged him  to ask the Sun and Moon why a well, that was the chief water supply of  the district, no longer gave good water. Jean promised to do so, and  resumed his journey.    After long and weary wanderings he reached the Sun's abode, and found  him about to start on his travels.    \"O Sun,\" said he, \"stop one moment, do not depart without first  answering a few questions.\"    \"Be quick then and speak, for I have to go all round the world  to-day.\"    \"Pray tell me why you do not warm or light the earth by night as well  as day?\"    \"For this simple reason, that if I did, the world and everything upon  it would be very soon burnt up.\"    Jean then put his questions concerning the pear-tree and the well. But  the Sun replied that his sister, the Moon, would be able to answer him  on those points.    Hardly had the Sun finished speaking before he was obliged to hurry  off, and Jean travelled far and fast to meet the Moon. On coming up to  her he said, \"Would you kindly stop one moment? there are a few  questions I should like to ask you.\"    \"Very well, be quick, for the earth is waiting for me,\" answered she,  and stood still at once.    \"Tell me, dear Moon, why you do not light the world by day as well as  by night? And why you never warm it?\"    \"Because if I lit up the world by day as well as by night the plants  would produce neither fruit nor flower. And though I do not warm the  earth, I supply it with dew, which makes it fertile and fruitful.\"    She was then about to continue her course, but Jean, begging her to  stop one moment longer, questioned her about the pear-tree which had  ceased to bear fruit.    And she answered him thus: \"While the king's "]]]
