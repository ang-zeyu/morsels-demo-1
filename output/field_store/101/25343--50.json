There has been no battle, only skirmishing with  the outposts, and nothing done of any moment. The weather is still  unfavourable to us. The roads, or rather tracks of mud, are almost  impassable and the number of sick large....    \"Truly and devotedly yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    My mother was at the Hot Springs--I had taken her there and was with  her. I don't now remember why, but it was decided that I should return  to the University of Virginia, which opened October 1st, and continue my  course there. While at the Springs my mother received this letter from  my father:    \"Valley Mount, September 17, 1861.    \"I received, dear Mary, your letter of the 5th by Beverly Turner [A son  of Mr. Edward Turner, of 'Kinloch'], who is a nice young soldier. I am  pained to see find young men like him, of education and standing, from  all the old and respectable families in the State, serving in the  ranks. I hope in time they will receive their reward. I met him as I was  returning from an expedition to the enemy's works, which I had hoped to  have surprised on the morning of the 12th, both at Cheat Mountain and  on Valley River. All the attacking parties with great labour had reached  their destination, over mountains considered impassable to bodies of  troops, notwithstanding a heavy storm that set in the day before and  raged all night, in which they had to stand up till daylight. Their arms  were then unserviceable, and they in poor condition for a fierce assault  against artillery and superior numbers. After waiting till 10 o'clock  for the assault on Cheat Mountain, which did not take place, and which  was to have been the signal for the rest, they were withdrawn, and,  after waiting three days in front of the enemy, hoping he would come out  of his trenches, we returned to our position at this place. I can not  tell you my regret and mortification at the untoward events that caused  the failure of the plan. I had taken every precaution to ensure success  and counted on it, but the Ruler of the Universe willed otherwise and  sent a storm to disconcert a well-laid plan, and to destroy my hopes.  We are no worse off now than before, except the disclosure of our plan,  against which they will guard. We met with one heavy loss which grieves  me deeply: Colonel Washington accompanied Fitzhugh on a reconnoitering  expedition, and I fear they were carried away by their zeal and  approached the enemy's pickets. The first they knew was a volley from a  concealed party within a few yards of them. Their balls passed through  the Colonel's body, then struck Fitzhugh's horse, and the horse of one  of the men was killed. Fitzhugh mounted the Colonel's horse and brought  him off. I am much grieved. He was always anxious to go on these  expeditions. This was the first day I assented. Since I had been thrown  into such intimate relations with him, I had learned to appreciate him  very highly. Morning and evening have I seen him on his knees praying to  his Maker.    \"'The righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart, and merciful  men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away  from the evil to come.' May God have mercy on us all! I suppose you are  at the Hot Springs and will direct to you there. Our poor sick, I know,  suffer much. They bring it on themselves by not doing what they are  told. They are worse than children, for the latter can be forced....    \"Truly yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    On the same day he wrote the Governor of Virginia:    \"Valley Mountain, September 17, 1861.    \"My Dear Governor: I received your very kind note of the 5th instant,  just as I was about to accompany General Loring's command on an  expedition to the enemy's works in front, or I would have before thanked  you for the interest you take in my welfare, and your too flattering  expressions of my ability. Indeed, you overrate me much, and I feel  humbled when I weigh myself by your standard. I am, however, very  grateful for your confidence, and I can answer for my sincerity in the  earnest endeavour I make to advance the cause I have so much at heart,  though conscious of the slow progress I make. I was very sanguine of  taking the enemy's works on last Thursday morning. I had considered the  subject well. With great effort the troops intended for the surprise  had reached their destination, having traversed twenty miles of steep,  rugged mountain paths; and the last day through a terrible storm, which  lasted all night, and in which they had to stand drenched to the skin in  cold rain. Still, their spirits were good. When morning broke, I could  see the enemy's tents on Valley River, at the point on the Huttonsville  road just below me. It was a tempting sight. We waited for the attack on  Cheat Mountain, which was to be the signal. Till 10 A. M. the men were  cleaning their unserviceable arms. But the signal did not come. All  chance for a surprise was gone. The provisions of the men had been  destroyed the preceding day by the storm. They had nothing to eat  that morning, could not hold out another day, and were obliged to be  withdrawn. The party sent to Cheat Mountain to take that in rear had  also to be withdrawn. The attack to come off the east side failed from  the difficulties in the way; the opportunity was lost, and our plan  discovered. It is a grievous disappointment to me, I assure you, but for  the rain-storm, I have no doubt it would have succeeded. This, Governor,  is for your own eye. Please do not speak of it; we must try again. Our  greatest loss is the death of my dear friend, Colonel Washington. He and  my son were reconnoitering the front of the enemy. They came unawares  upon a concealed party, who fired upon them within twenty yards, and  the Colonel fell pierced by three balls. My son's horse received three  shots, but he escaped on the Colonel's horse. His zeal for the cause to  which he had devoted himself carried him, I fear, too far. We took some  seventy prisoners, and killed some twenty-five or thirty of the  enemy. Our loss was small besides what I have mentioned. Our greatest  difficulty is the roads. It has been raining in these mountains about  six weeks. It is impossible to get along. It is that which has paralysed  all our efforts. With sincere thanks for your good wishes,    \"I am very truly yours,    \"R. E. Lee.    \"His Excellency, Governor John Letcher.\"            Chapter III --  Letters to Wife and Daughters      From Camp on Sewell's Mountain--Quotation from Colonel Taylor's  book--From Professor Wm. P. Trent--From Mr. Davis's Memorial  Address--Defense of Southern ports--Christmas, 1861--The General visits  his father's grave--Commands, under the President, all the armies of the  Confederate States      The season being too far advanced to attempt any further movements away  from our base of supplies, and the same reasons preventing any advance  of the Federal forces, the campaign in this part of Virginia ended for  the winter. In the Kanawha Valley, however, the enemy had been and were  quite active. Large reinforcements under General Rosecrans were sent  there to assist General Cox, the officer in command at that point.  General Loring, leaving a sufficient force to watch the enemy at Cheat  Mountain, moved the rest of his army to join the commands of Generals  Floyd and Wise, who were opposing the advance of Cox. General Lee, about  September 20th, reached General Floyd's camp, and immediately proceeded  to arrange the lines of defense. Shortly after his arrival there he  wrote to my mother at the Hot Springs:    \"Camp on Sewell's Mountain,    \"September 26, 1881.    \"I have just received, dear Mary, your letter of the 17th and 19th  instants, with one from Robert. I have but little time for writing  to-night, and will, therefore, write to you.... Having now disposed  of business matters, I will say how glad I am to hear from you, and to  learn that you have reached the Hot in safety, with daughter and Rob. I  pray that its healing waters may benefit you all. I am glad to hear of  Charlotte and the girls, and hope all will go well with them. I infer  you received my letter before leaving Valley Mountain, though you did  not direct your letter 'via Lewisburg, Greenbrier County,' and hence its  delay. I told you of the death of Colonel Washington. I grieve for his  loss, though trust him to the mercy of our Heavenly Father. May He have  mercy on us all.    \"It is raining heavily. The men are all exposed on the mountain, with  the enemy opposite to us. We are without tents, and for two nights I  have lain buttoned up in my overcoat. To-day my tent came up and I am in  it. Yet I fear I shall not sleep for thinking of the poor men. I wrote  about socks for myself. I have no doubt the yarn ones you mention will  be very acceptable to the men here or elsewhere. If you can send them  here, I will distribute them to the most needy. Tell Rob I could not  write to him for want of time. My heart is always with you and my  children. May God guard and bless you all is the constant prayer of    \"Your devoted husband,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    To my mother, still at the Hot Springs:    \"Sewell's Mountain, October 7, 1861.    \"I received, dear Mary, your letter by Doctor Quintard, with the cotton  socks. Both were very acceptable, though the latter I have not yet  tried. At the time of their reception the enemy was threatening an  attack, which was continued till Saturday night, when under cover of  darkness we suddenly withdrew. Your letter of the 2d, with the yarn  socks, four pairs, was handed to me when I was preparing to follow, and  I could not at the time attend to either. But I have since, and as I  found Perry in desperate need, I bestowed a couple of pairs on him, as  a present from you, the others I have put in my trunk and suppose they  will fall to the lot of Meredith [His cook--a servant from the White  House], into the state of whose hose I have not yet inquired."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],[0,"Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#9)"],[1,"ASCETIC AND THE HIND.    _From the Vishnu Purana. B. II. Chap. XIII._            MAITREYA. Of old thou gav'st a promise to relate      The deeds of Bharat, that great hermit-king:      Beloved Master, now the occasion suits,      And I am all attention.        PARASARA.             Brahman, hear.        With a mind fixed intently on his gods      Long reigned in Saligram of ancient fame,      The mighty monarch of the wide, wide world.      Chief of the virtuous, never in his life      Harmed he, or strove to harm, his fellow-man,      Or any creature sentient. But he left      His kingdom in the forest-shades to dwell,      And changed his sceptre for a hermit's staff,      And with ascetic rites, privations rude,      And constant prayers, endeavoured to attain      Perfect dominion on his soul. At morn,      Fuel, and flowers, and fruit, and holy grass,      He gathered for oblations; and he passed      In stern devotions all his other hours;      Of the world heedless, and its myriad cares,      And heedless too of wealth, and love, and fame.          Once on a time, while living thus, he went      To bathe where through the wood the river flows:      And his ablutions done, he sat him down      Upon the shelving bank to muse and pray.      Thither impelled by thirst a graceful hind,      Big with its young, came fearlessly to drink.      Sudden, while yet she drank, the lion's roar,      Feared by all creatures, like a thunder-clap      Burst in that solitude from a thicket nigh.      Startled, the hind leapt up, and from her womb      Her offspring tumbled in the rushing stream.      Whelmed by the hissing waves and carried far      By the strong current swoln by recent rain,      The tiny thing still struggled for its life,      While its poor mother, in her fright and pain,      Fell down upon the bank, and breathed her last.      Up rose the hermit-monarch at the sight      Full of keen anguish; with his pilgrim staff      He drew the new-born creature from the wave;      'Twas panting fast, but life was in it still.      Now, as he saw its luckless mother dead,      He would not leave it in the woods alone,      But with the tenderest pity brought it home.        There, in his leafy hut, he gave it food,      And daily nourished it with patient care,      Until it grew in stature and in strength,      And to the forest skirts could venture forth      In search of sustenance. At early morn      Thenceforth it used to leave the hermitage      And with the shades of evening come again,      And in the little courtyard of the hut      Lie down in peace, unless the tigers fierce,      Prowling about, compelled it to return      Earlier at noon. But whether near or far,      Wandering abroad, or resting in its home,      The monarch-hermit's heart was with it still,      Bound by affection's ties; nor could he think      Of anything besides this little hind,      His nursling. Though a kingdom he had left,      And children, and a host of loving friends,      Almost without a tear, the fount of love      Sprang out anew within his blighted heart,      To greet this dumb, weak, helpless foster-child,      And so, whene'er it lingered in the wilds,      Or at the 'customed hour could not return,      His thoughts went with it; \"And alas!\" he cried,      \"Who knows, perhaps some lion or some wolf,      Or ravenous tiger with relentless jaws      Already hath devoured it,--timid thing!      Lo, how the earth is dinted with its hoofs,      And variegated. Surely for my joy      It was created. When will it come back,      And rub its budding antlers on my arms      In token of its love and deep delight      To see my face? The shaven stalks of grass,      Kusha and kasha, by its new teeth clipped,      Remind me of it, as they stand in lines      Like pious boys who chant the Samga Veds      Shorn by their vows of all their wealth of hair.\"      Thus passed the monarch-hermit's time; in joy,      With smiles upon his lips, whenever near      His little favourite; in bitter grief      And fear, and trouble, when it wandered far.      And he who had abandoned ease and wealth,      And friends and dearest ties, and kingly power,      Found his devotions broken by the love      He had bestowed upon a little hind      Thrown in his way by chance. Years glided on....      And Death, who spareth none, approached at last      The hermit-king to summon him away;      The hind was at his side, with tearful eyes      Watching his last sad moments, like a child      Beside a father. He too, watched and watched      His favourite through a blinding film of tears,      And could not think of the Beyond at hand,      So keen he felt the parting, such deep grief      O'erwhelmed him for the creature he had reared.      To it devoted was his last, last thought,      Reckless of present and of future both!          Thus far the pious chronicle, writ of old      By Brahman sage; but we, who happier, live      Under the holiest dispensation, know      That God is Love, and not to be adored      By a devotion born of stoic pride,      Or with ascetic rites, or penance hard,      But with a love, in character akin      To His unselfish, all-including love.      And therefore little can we sympathize      With what the Brahman sage would fain imply      As the concluding moral of his tale,      That for the hermit-king it was a sin      To love his nursling. What! a sin to love!      A sin to pity! Rather should we deem      Whatever Brahmans wise, or monks may hold,      That he had sinned in _casting off_ all love      By his retirement to the forest-shades;      For that was to abandon duties high,      And, like a recreant soldier, leave the post      Where God had placed him as a sentinel.        This little hind brought strangely on his path,      This love engendered in his withered heart,      This hindrance to his rituals,--might these not      Have been ordained to teach him? Call him back      To ways marked out for him by Love divine?      And with a mind less self-willed to adore?        Not in seclusion, not apart from all,      Not in a place elected for its peace,      But in the heat and bustle of the world,      'Mid sorrow, sickness, suffering and sin,      Must he still labour with a loving soul      Who strives to enter through the narrow gate.          V.    THE LEGEND OF DHRUVA.    _Vishnu Purana. Book I. Chapter XI._          Sprung from great Brahma, Manu had two sons,      Heroic and devout, as I have said,      Pryavrata and Uttanapado,--names      Known in legends; and of these the last      Married two wives, Suruchee, his adored,      The mother of a handsome petted boy      Uttama; and Suneetee, less beloved,      The mother of another son whose name      Was Dhruva. Seated on his throne the king      Uttanapado, on his knee one day      Had placed Uttama; Dhruva, who beheld      His brother in that place of honour, longed      To clamber up and by his playmate sit;      Led on by Love he came, but found, alas!      Scant welcome and encouragement; the king      Saw fair Suruchee sweep into the hall      With stately step,--aye, every inch a queen,      And dared not smile upon her co-wife's son.      Observing him,--her rival's boy,--intent      To mount ambitious to his father's knee,      Where sat her own, thus fair Suruchee spake:      \"Why hast thou, child, formed such a vain design?      Why harboured such an aspiration proud,      Born from another's womb and not from mine?      Oh thoughtless! To desire the loftiest place,      The throne of thrones, a royal father's lap!      It is an honour to the destined given,      And not within thy reach. What though thou art      Born of the king; those sleek and tender limbs      Hold of my blood no portion; I am queen.      To be the equal of mine only son      Were in thee vain ambition. Know'st thou not,      Fair prattler, thou art sprung,--not, not from mine,      But from Suneetee's bowels? Learn thy place.\"        Repulsed in silence from his father's lap,      Indignant, furious, at the words that fell      From his step-mother's lips, poor Dhruva ran      To his own mother's chambers, where he stood      Beside her with his pale, thin, trembling lips,      (Trembling with an emotion ill-suppressed)      And hair in wild disorder, till she took      And raised him to her lap, and gently said:      \"Oh, child, what means this? What can be the cause      Of this great anger? Who hath given thee pain?      He that hath vexed thee, hath despised thy sire,      For in these veins thou hast the royal blood.\"        Thus conjured, Dhruva, with a swelling heart      Repeated to his mother every word      That proud Suruchee spake, from first to last,      Even in the very presence of the king.        His speech oft broken by his tears and sobs,      Helpless Suneetee, languid-eyed from care,      Heard sighing deeply, and then soft replied:      \"Oh son, to lowly fortune thou wert born,      And what my co-wife said to thee is truth;      No enemy to Heaven's favoured ones may say      Such words as thy step-mother said to thee.      Yet, son, it is not meet that thou shouldst grieve      Or vex thy soul. The deeds that thou hast done,      The evil, haply, in some former life,      Long, long ago, who may alas! annul,      Or who the good works not done, supplement!      The sins of previous lives must bear their fruit.      The ivory throne, the umbrella of gold,      The best steed, and the royal elephant      Rich caparisoned, must be his by right      Who has deserved them by his virtuous acts      In times long past. Oh think on this, my son,      And be content. For glorious actions done      Not in this life, but in some previous birth,      Suruchee by the monarch is beloved.      Women, unfortunate like myself, who bear      Only the name of wife without the powers,      But pine and suffer for our ancient sins.      Suruchee raised her "]]]
