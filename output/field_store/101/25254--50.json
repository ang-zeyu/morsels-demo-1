The lad you mourn will never return    To make little Mary his bride.\"      She startled and trembled and then she did say,    \"All the fortune I have I freely give    If what I ask you will tell unto me,--    Say, does young William yet live?\"    \"He lives and is true and poverty poor,    And shipwreck has suffered beside;    He'll return no more, because he is poor,    To make little Mary his bride.\"      \"No tongue can tell the joy I do feel    Although his misfortune I mourn,    And he's welcome to me though poverty poor,    His jacket all tattered and torn.    I love him so dear, so true and sincere,    I'll have no other beside;    Those with riches enrobed and covered with gold    Can't make little Mary their bride.\"      The beggar then tore the patch from his eye,    His crutches he laid by his side,    Coat, jacket and bundle; cheeks red as a rose,    'Twas William that stood by her side.    \"Then excuse me, dear maid,\" to her he said,    \"It was only your love I tried.\"    So he hastened away at the close of the day    To make little Mary his bride.          MUSTANG GRAY        There once was a noble ranger,    They called him Mustang Gray;    He left his home when but a youth,    Went ranging far away.        But he'll go no more a-ranging,      The savage to affright;      He has heard his last war-whoop,      And fought his last fight.      He ne'er would sleep within a tent,    No comforts would he know;    But like a brave old Tex-i-an,    A-ranging he would go.      When Texas was invaded    By a mighty tyrant foe,    He mounted his noble war-horse    And a-ranging he did go.      Once he was taken prisoner,    Bound in chains upon the way,    He wore the yoke of bondage    Through the streets of Monterey.      A senorita loved him,    And followed by his side;    She opened the gates and gave to him    Her father's steed to ride.      God bless the senorita,    The belle of Monterey,    She opened wide the prison door    And let him ride away.      And when this veteran's life was spent,    It was his last command    To bury him on Texas soil    On the banks of the Rio Grande;      And there the lonely traveler,    When passing by his grave,    Will shed a farewell tear    O'er the bravest of the brave.        And he'll go no more a-ranging,      The savage to affright;      He has heard his last war-whoop,      And fought his last fight.          YOUNG COMPANIONS        Come all you young companions    And listen unto me,    I'll tell you a story    Of some bad company.      I was born in Pennsylvania    Among the beautiful hills    And the memory of my childhood    Is warm within me still.      I did not like my fireside,    I did not like my home;    I had in view far rambling,    So far away did roam.      I had a feeble mother,    She oft would plead with me;    And the last word she gave me    Was to pray to God in need.      I had two loving sisters,    As fair as fair could be,    And oft beside me kneeling    They oft would plead with me.      I bid adieu to loved ones,    To my home I bid farewell,    And I landed in Chicago    In the very depth of hell.      It was there I took to drinking,    I sinned both night and day,    And there within my bosom    A feeble voice would say:      \"Then fare you well, my loved one,    May God protect my boy,    And blessings ever with him    Throughout his manhood joy.\"      I courted a fair young maiden,    Her name I will not tell,    For I should ever disgrace her    Since I am doomed for hell.      It was on one beautiful evening,    The stars were shining bright,    And with a fatal dagger    I bid her spirit flight.      So justice overtook me,    You all can plainly see,    My soul is doomed forever    Throughout eternity.      It's now I'm on the scaffold,    My moments are not long;    You may forget the singer    But don't forget the song.          LACKEY BILL        Come all you good old boys and listen to my rhymes,    We are west of Eastern Texas and mostly men of crimes;    Each with a hidden secret well smothered in his breast,    Which brought us out to Mexico, way out here in the West.      My parents raised me tenderly, they had no child but me,    Till I began to ramble and with them could never agree.    My mind being bent on rambling did grieve their poor hearts sore,    To leave my aged parents them to see no more.      I was borned and raised in Texas, though never come to fame,    A cowboy by profession, C.W. King, by name.    Oh, when the war was ended I did not like to work,    My brothers were not happy, for I had learned to shirk.      In fact I was not able, my health was very bad,    I had no constitution, I was nothing but a lad.    I had no education, I would not go to school,    And living off my parents I thought it rather cool.      So I set a resolution to travel to the West,    My parents they objected, but still I thought it best.    It was out on the Seven Rivers all out on the Pecos stream,    It was there I saw a country I thought just suited me.      I thought I would be no stranger and lead a civil life,    In order to be happy would choose myself a wife.    On one Sabbath evening in the merry month of May    To a little country singing I happened there to stray.      It was there I met a damsel I never shall forget,    The impulse of that moment remains within me yet.    We soon became acquainted, I thought she would fill the bill,    She seemed to be good-natured, which helps to climb the hill.      She was a handsome figure though not so very tall;    Her hair was red as blazes, I hate it worst of all.    I saw her home one evening in the presence of her pap,    I bid them both good evening with a note left in her lap.      And when I got an answer I read it with a rush,    I found she had consented, my feelings was a hush.    But now I have changed my mind, boys, I am sure I wish her well.    Here's to that precious jewel, I'm sure I wish her well.      This girl was Miss Mollie Walker who fell in love with me,    She was a lovely Western girl, as lovely as could be,    She was so tall, so handsome, so charming and so fair,    There is not a girl in this whole world with her I could compare.      She said my pockets would be lined with gold, hard work then I'd        leave o'er    If I'd consent to live with her and say I'd roam no more.    My mind began to ramble and it grieved my poor heart sore,    To leave my darling girl, her to see no more.      I asked if it made any difference if I crossed o'er the plains;    She said it made no difference if I returned again.    So we kissed, shook hands, and parted, I left that girl behind.    She said she'd prove true to me till death proved her unkind.      I rode in the town of Vagus, all in the public square;    The mail coach had arrived, the post boy met me there.    He handed me a letter that gave me to understand    That the girl I loved in Texas had married another man.      So I read a little farther and found those words were true.    I turned myself all around, not knowing what to do.    I'll sell my horse, saddle, and bridle, cow-driving I'll resign,    I'll search this world from town to town for the girl I left behind.      Here the gold I find in plenty, the girls to me are kind,    But my pillow is haunted with the girl I left behind.    It's trouble and disappointment is all that I can see,    For the dearest girl in all the world has gone square back on me.          WHOOPEE TI YI YO, GIT ALONG LITTLE DOGIES        As I walked out one morning for pleasure,    I spied a cow-puncher all riding alone;    His hat was throwed back and his spurs was a jingling,    As he approached me a-singin' this song,        Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,      It's your misfortune, and none of my own.      Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,      For you know Wyoming will be your new home.      Early in the spring we round up the dogies,    Mark and brand and bob off their tails;    Round up our horses, load up the chuck-wagon,    Then throw the dogies upon the trail.      It's whooping and yelling and driving the dogies;    Oh how I wish you would go on;    It's whooping and punching and go on little dogies,    For you know Wyoming will be your new home.      Some boys goes up the trail for pleasure,    But that's where you get it most awfully wrong;    For you haven't any idea the trouble they give us    While we go driving them all along.      When the night comes on and we hold them on the bedground,    These little dogies that roll on so slow;    Roll up the herd and cut out the strays,    And roll the little dogies that never rolled before.      Your mother she was raised way down in Texas,    Where the jimson weed and sand-burrs grow;    Now we'll fill you up on prickly pear and cholla    Till you are ready for the trail to Idaho.      Oh, you'll be soup for Uncle Sam's Injuns;    \"It's beef, heap beef,\" I hear them cry.    Git along, git along, git along little dogies    You're going to be beef steers by and by.        Whoopee Ti Yi Yo, Git Along Little Dogies (Mus. Not.)        As I was a-walk-ing one morn-ing for pleasure,    I spied   a cow-punch-er all rid-ing a-lone;    His hat was throw'd back and his spurs was a-jing-lin',    As he ap-proach'd me a-sing-in' this song:      REFRAIN.      Whoopee ti yi yo, git a-long little dog-ies,    Its your mis-for-tune and none of my own.    Whoop-ee ti yi yo, git a-long lit-tie dog-ies,    For you know Wy-o-ming will be your new home.          THE U-S-U RANGE        O come cowboys and listen to my song,    I'm in hopes I'll please you and not keep you long;    I'll sing you of things you may think strange    About West Texas and the U-S-U range.      You may go to Stamford and there see a man    Who wears a white shirt and is asking for hands;    You may ask him for work and he'll answer you short,    He will hurry you up,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2131"],[0,"An Account of Egypt (#9)"],[1,"but _champsai_, and the Ionians gave them the name  of crocodile, comparing their form to that of the crocodiles (lizards)  which appear in their country in the stone walls. There are many ways in  use of catching them and of various kinds: I shall describe that which  to me seems the most worthy of being told. A man puts the back of a pig  upon a hook as bait, and lets it go into the middle of the river, while  he himself upon the bank of the river has a young live pig, which he  beats; and the crocodile hearing its cries makes for the direction of  the sound, and when he finds the pig's back he swallows it down: then  they pull, and when he is drawn out to land, first of all the hunter  forthwith plasters up his eyes with mud, and having done so he very  easily gets the mastery of him, but if he does not do so he has much  trouble.    The river-horse is sacred in the district of Papremis, but for the  other Egyptians he is not sacred; and this is the appearance which he  presents: he is four-footed, cloven-hoofed like an ox, flat-nosed, with  a mane like a horse and showing teeth like tusks, with a tail and voice  like a horse and in size as large as the largest ox; and his hide is  so exceedingly thick that when it has been dried shafts of javelins are  made of it. There are moreover otters in the river, which they consider  to be sacred: and of fish also they esteem that which is called the  _lepidotos_ to be sacred, and also the eel; and these they say are  sacred to the Nile: and of birds the fox-goose.    There is also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I did not  myself see except in painting, for in truth he comes to them very  rarely, at intervals, as the people of Heliopolis say, of five hundred  years; and these say that he comes regularly when his father dies; and  if he be like the painting he is of this size and nature, that is to  say, some of his feathers are of gold colour and others red, and in  outline and size he is as nearly as possible like an eagle. This bird  they say (but I cannot believe the story) contrives as follows:--setting  forth from Arabia he conveys his father, they say, to the temple of the  Sun (Helios) plastered up in myrrh, and buries him in the temple of the  Sun; and he conveys him thus:--he forms first an egg of myrrh as large  as he is able to carry, and then he makes trial of carrying it, and when  he has made trial sufficiently, then he hollows out the egg and places  his father within it and plasters over with other myrrh that part of the  egg where he hollowed it out to put his father in, and when his father  is laid in it, it proves (they say) to be of the same weight as it was;  and after he has plastered it up, he conveys the whole to Egypt to the  temple of the Sun. Thus they say that this bird does.    There are also about Thebes sacred serpents, not at all harmful to men,  which are small in size and have two horns growing from the top of the  head: these they bury when they die in the temple of Zeus, for to this  god they say that they are sacred. There is a region moreover in Arabia,  situated nearly over against the city of Buto, to which place I came to  inquire about the winged serpents: and when I came thither I saw bones  of serpents and spines in quantity so great that it is impossible to  make report of the number, and there were heaps of spines, some heaps  large and others less large and others smaller still than these, and  these heaps were many in number. This region in which the spines are  scattered upon the ground is of the nature of an entrance from a narrow  mountain pass to a great plain, which plain adjoins the plain in Egypt;  and the story goes that at the beginning of spring winged serpents from  Arabia fly towards Egypt, and the birds called ibises meet them at the  entrance to this country and do not suffer the serpents to go by but  kill them. On account of this deed it is (say the Arabians) that the  ibis has come to be greatly honoured by the Egyptians, and the Egyptians  also agree that it is for this reason that they honour these birds. The  outward form of the ibis is this:--it is a deep black all over, and has  legs like those of a crane and a very curved beak, and in size it is  about equal to a rail: this is the appearance of the black kind which  fight with the serpents, but of those which most crowd round men's feet  (for there are two several kinds of ibises) the head is bare and also  the whole of the throat, and it is white in feathering except the head  and neck and the extremities of the wings and the rump (in all these  parts of which I have spoken it is a deep black), while in legs and in  the form of the head it resembles the other. As for the serpent its form  is like that of the watersnake; and it has wings not feathered but most  nearly resembling the wings of the bat. Let so much suffice as has been  said now concerning sacred animals.        Of the Egyptians themselves, those who dwell in the part of Egypt which  is sown for crops practise memory more than any other men and are  the most learned in history by far of all those of whom I have  had experience: and their manner of life is as follows:--For three  successive days in each month they purge, hunting after health with  emetics and clysters, and they think that all the diseases which exist  are produced in men by the food on which they live: for the Egyptians  are from other causes also the most healthy of all men next after the  Libyans (in my opinion on account of the seasons, because the seasons  do not change, for by the changes of things generally, and especially  of the seasons, diseases are most apt to be produced in men), and as to  their diet, it is as follows:--they eat bread, making loaves of maize,  which they call _kyllestis_, and they use habitually a wine made out of  barley, for vines they have not in their land. Of their fish some they  dry in the sun and then eat them without cooking, others they eat cured  in brine. Of birds they eat quails and ducks and small birds without  cooking, after first curing them; and everything else which they have  belonging to the class of birds or fishes, except such as have been  set apart by them as sacred, they eat roasted or boiled. In the  entertainments of the rich among them, when they have finished eating, a  man bears round a wooden figure of a dead body in a coffin, made as like  the reality as may be both by painting and carving, and measuring about  a cubit or two cubits each way; and this he shows to each of those who  are drinking together, saying: \"When thou lookest upon this, drink and  be merry, for thou shalt be such as this when thou art dead.\" Thus they  do at their carousals. The customs which they practise are derived from  their fathers and they do not acquire others in addition; but besides  other customary things among them which are worthy of mention, they have  one song, that of Linos, the same who is sung of both in Phenicia and in  Cyprus and elsewhere, having however a name different according to the  various nations. This song agrees exactly with that which the Hellenes  sing calling on the name of Linos, so that besides many other things  about which I wonder among those matters which concern Egypt, I wonder  especially about this, namely whence they got the song of Linos. It is  evident however that they have sung this song from immemorial time, and  in the Egyptian tongue Linos is called Maneros. The Egyptians told me  that he was the only son of him who first became king of Egypt, and that  he died before his time and was honoured with these lamentations by  the Egyptians, and that this was their first and only song. In another  respect the Egyptians are in agreement with some of the Hellenes, namely  with the Lacedemonians, but not with the rest, that is to say, the  younger of them when they meet the elder give way and move out of the  path, and when their elders approach, they rise out of their seat. In  this which follows however they are not in agreement with any of the  Hellenes,--instead of addressing one another in the roads they do  reverence, lowering their hand down to their knee. They wear tunics of  linen about their legs with fringes, which they call _calasiris_; above  these they have garments of white wool thrown over: woolen garments  however are not taken into the temples, nor are they buried with them,  for this is not permitted by religion. In these points they are in  agreement with the observances called Orphic and Bacchic (which are  really Egyptian), and also with those of the Pythagoreans, for one who  takes part in these mysteries is also forbidden by religious rule to be  buried in woolen garments; and about this there is a sacred story told.    Besides these things the Egyptians have found out also to what god each  month and each day belongs, and what fortunes a man will meet with who  is born on any particular day, and how he will die, and what kind of  a man he will be: and these inventions were taken up by those of the  Hellenes who occupied themselves about poesy. Portents too have been  found out by them more than by all other men besides; for when a portent  has happened, they observe and write down the event which comes of it,  and if ever afterwards anything resembling this happens, they believe  that the event which comes of it will be similar. Their divination is  ordered thus:--the art is assigned not to any man but to certain of the  gods, for there are in their land Oracles of Heracles, of Apollo, of  Athene, of Artemis, or Ares, and of Zeus, and moreover that which they  hold most in honour of all, namely the Oracle of Leto which is in the  city of Buto. The manner of divination however is not established among  them according to the same fashion everywhere, but is different  in different places. The art of medicine among them is distributed  thus:--each physician is a physician of one disease and of no more; "]]]
