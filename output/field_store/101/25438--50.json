Eight pegs are used, made of hard wood, generally ash, four of which  are called the \"chief pegs.\" The whole of the pegs are notched, for  the convenience of attaching a line.    The method of laying the clap-net is best described with the aid of a  drawing (vide Fig. 5).    The first thing to be done is to lay down the right-hand net, and to  drive in the two chief pegs where shown, namely, at the bottom of the  staves, to which they are attached by a loop of strong cord, acting as  a hinge. The two end pegs are then driven in the ground at some little  distance from and in an exact line to the chief pegs. The bottom line  is then made fast at each end, as also the continuation of the top  line. The two pegs, lines, and staff thus forma triangle at each end.  The other net is then laid in such a manner that when both are pulled  over, one net shall overlap the other to the extent of six inches. It  is then turned back and pegged down in the same way as the right-hand  net. The next operation is to tie the forked line to each top end of  the staves, a nick being cut in each for this purpose.    Exactly in the centre of the forked line the pull line is knotted, at  the other end of which the birdcatcher stands at varying distances,  according to the bird he wishes to catch; for instance, for linnets or  goldfinches, thirty to forty yards; for starlings a greater distance  is required; or to capture these wary birds a better plan is to place  the nets in one field while you retire into another, bringing the pull  line through an intervening hedge.    Cages containing birds are dispersed about on the outer edges of the  nets, the best, or call birds, being placed farther away; in fact, my  informant thinks that if all the cages were placed a moderate distance  away from the nets it would be better, as he has found that the usual  red or green cages have been the means of \"bashing \"--i.e.  frightening--the wild birds away from the nets.    Fig. 5--PLAN AND METHOD OF SETTING CLAP-NET.    \"When doctors differ, who shall decide?\"    On mentioning the above to another birdcatcher he gave a huge snort of  dissatisfaction, and roundly swore that my man knew \"nought about it,\"  for he always set his cages as near the nets as possible; \"for don't  it stand to reason,\" quoth he, \"that if you set your cages fur away,  your 'call birds' will 'tice the wild 'uns down round 'em? an' they  won't come near your nets.\"    An important actor in the performance is the \"play-bird,\" which is a  bird braced by a peculiar knot or \"brace,\" as shown in Fig. 6, on an  arrangement called the play-stick.    The \"play-stick\" is resolvable into three parts, Fig. 7 being the  ground peg, formed of a piece of hard wood about six inches long,  having a round hole bored through close to the top, through which the  \"play-line\" passes. Immediately underneath is a square slot for the  reception of a piece of brass tube beaten flat at one end (Fig. 8),  while the other end is left open for the reception of the \"play-stick\"  (C, Fig. 9), simply a rough twig or piece of hard wood, upon which the  bird is tied by the \"brace\" (Fig. 6)--which is constructed, as shown  in drawing, by doubling a piece of string, tying a knot in the centre  and then joining the ends. The head and body of the bird is thrust  through, so that a loop catches it on each side and in front of the  wings, the legs and tail being thrust through the other, one loop  coming on each side of the body behind the wings. A swivel is attached  at one of the knots, and, by another piece of string, is made fast to  the play-stick near its end. The bird is thus perfectly free so far as  the wings and legs are concerned.    Fig. 6, 7 & 8--\"Play-stick\" parts    The \"play-stick,\" as a whole, is represented in Fig. 9, which shows  the bird in repose, with the end of the stick (C) resting on the  ground, the play-line passing through a hole in the ground peg (A),  while the part marked B works in the slot in the same.    A little food and water are put down by the play-bird's side, to which  it addresses itself in its intervals of rest. Directly birds appear,  the play-line is smartly pulled, which has the effect of jerking the  play-bird upwards, while at the same time it flutters its wings to  regain its perch. This motion is mistaken by the wild birds as a  natural proceeding; they accordingly alight around the play-bird, to  assist it in feeding. The pull-line of the net is then smartly jerked,  which causes the forked-line to fly inwards, and, acting on the hinged  pegs and top and bottom lines as by a lever, the staves rise from the  outside, become perpendicular, and finally fall over, inclosing all  within the open space in the nets.    Fig. 9--\"FLUR\" OR \"PLAY-STICK.\"    The \"Play-bird\" is always placed on the left hand of the birdcatcher,  about two yards into the net. Sometimes more than one play-stick and  bird are used; all are, however, played by the same string. The best  birds are, however, contrary to my expectations, not used, as the  constant pulling up and down, to say nothing of the worry of the  falling nets, very soon kills the poor little \"play-bird.\" From  Michaelmas to Christmas would appear to be the best times for  catching.    Many rare birds not calculated on by the operator, are procured in  this way. I allude to hawks, which constantly dash at the call, or  play-birds, of the netsman. I remember seeing, taken in a lark net on  the racecourse of Corfu--one of the Ionian Isles--a most beautiful  male specimen of the hen harrier (Circus cyaneus, Macg.); and here in  England I have received, within the last few years, one great grey  shrike (Lanus excubitor, 1.), four or five hobby hawks (Falco  subbuteo, 1.), a dozen or more merlins (Falco oesalon, Tunstall), and  a great number of sparrowhawks, and kestrels, all captured by this  method.    Draw-nets are those used by fen-men and others at night for taking  lark, snipe, plover, etc, by dragging a long net of a certain  construction over the fields and swamps. The actual originator of this  method of capture as applied to snipe and such birds, appears to have  been Mr. Daniel himself (vide \"Rural Sports,\" vol. 3, p. 179).    Glade nets, which are nets stretched in narrow glades or ridings in  woods from tree to tree, are used chiefly for taking night-flying  birds, such as woodcocks, or wild ducks. Folkard thus describes their  use:    \"The proceedings connected with the use of glade nets appear to be  very simple. These nets are of lengths and breadths proportioned to  the places in which they are suspended. They are simply pieces of fine  thread netting, edged with cords adapted to the extent of the lint.  The glade net so formed is suspended between two trees, directly in  the track of the woodcock's flight. Both the upper and lower corners  have each a rope attached to them which, as regards the upper part of  the net, is rove through sheaves, iron rings, or thimbles fastened to  the trees on either side at the top of the glade at a moderate height,  varying from ten to twelve or fifteen feet. The falls of the two upper  ropes are joined or so adjusted that they form a bridge, to the  central part of which a rope is attached of several yards in length,  which the fowler holds in his hand in a place of concealment, and thus  commands full power over the net, being able to drop it down suddenly  and intercept the flight of any birds which may attempt to escape  through the glade; or he can draw it up as suddenly from the ground to  a perpendicular position. A stone, of about 5 lb. weight, is attached  to each of the lower cords of the net, so that when the fowler lets go  his controlling rope the weight of the stones forces the lower part of  the net down in an instant with a strong fall, and, at the same time,  they draw up the upper part of the net. The fowler having stationed  himself in such a position as to command a full view of the glade in  which his net is placed, beaters are employed to flush the cocks from  their retreats; immediately on one or more flying in the direction of  the fowler a signal is given, and just as the bird approaches the net  it is suddenly let down or drawn up, when the woodcock, flying  forcibly against it, is immediately ensnared. The instant the birds  have struck the net the fowler lets go another rope, which is  generally looped to a stake within reach of his arm, and the whole  net, with the birds entangled, then drops to the ground. In forcing  themselves forward in their endeavour to escape they form the net into  a sort of bag, which makes their capture more certain.\"    Nets are in some parts of the world set under water to procure wild  fowl. I remember, when in Norfolk, a gannet being brought in by one of  the fishing boats; the bird had become accidentally entangled in one  of the nets whilst attempting to rob-it of some fish.    Small nets of a few yards long, made of fine black silk, with a small  mesh, are used in some parts of the country for taking kingfishers.  These nets are stretched across a small watercourse or the arch of a  bridge in such a manner that, a little \"slack\" being allowed, the bird  is taken to a certainty in attempting to pass. So fatal is this net  when skilfully set, that I know one man who adds several pounds to his  income in the course of a year by taking kingfishers in this manner.    For the netting of hawks by a contrivance called the bow net, which  was formerly used in England, see Blaine's \"Encyclopaedia of Rural  Sports.\"    Many birds (notably sea and rock birds) are to be procured by  descending the rocks attached to a stout line. But this highly  dangerous work had better not be attempted by the tyro. For an ancient  but interesting account of rock fowling in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26030"],[0,"The Automobilist Abroad (#9)"],[1,"the middle ages there appeared in France the _cabaret_, the  _gargot_, the _taverne_, and then the _auberge_, many of which,  endowed with no more majestic name, exist even to-day.    ICI ON LOGE a PIED ET a CHEVAL    is a sign frequently seen along the roadways of France, and even in  the villages and small towns. It costs usually ten sous a night for  man, and five sous for his beast, though frequently there is a  fluctuating price.    The _aubergiste_ of other days, on the routes most frequented, was an  enterprising individual, if reports are to be believed. Frequently he  would stand at his door and cry out his prices to passers-by. \"_Au  Cheval Blanc! On dine pour douze sous. Huit sous le cocher. Six  liards l'ecurie._\"    With the era of the diligences there came the Hotels de la Poste,  with vast paved courtyards, great stables, and meals at all hours,  but the chambers still remained more or less primitive, and in truth  have until a very recent date.    There is absolutely no question but that automobilism has brought  about a great change in the hotel system of France. It may have had  some slight effect elsewhere, but in France its influence has been  enormous. The guide-books of a former generation did nothing but put  an asterisk against the names of those hotels which struck the fancy  of the compiler, and it was left to the great manufacturers of  \"_pneumatiques_\" for automobiles to carry the scheme to a  considerably more successful issue. Michelin, in preparing his  excellent route-book, bombarded the hotel-keeper throughout the  length and breadth of France with a series of questions, which he  need not answer if he did not choose, but which, if he neglected, was  most likely taken advantage of by his competitor.    Given a small _chef-lieu_, a market-town in France, with two  competing establishments, the one which was marked by the compiler of  this excellent road-book as having the latest sanitary arrangements,  with perhaps a dark room for photographers, stood a much better  chance of the patronage of the automobile traveller than he who had  merely a blank against the name of his house. The following selection  of this appalling array of questions, used in the preparation of the  Guide-Michelin, will explain this to the full:    Is your hotel open all the year?    What is the price per day which the automobilist _en tour_ may count  on spending with you? (This is purposely noncommittal so far as an  ironbound statement is concerned, being more particularly for  classification, and is anyway a much better system of classification  than by a detailed price-list of _dejeuner, diner_, etc.)    What is the price of an average room, with service and lights? (Be  it noted that only in avowed tourist resorts, or in the case of  very new travellers, are the ridiculous items of \"_service et  bougie_\"--service and lights--ever charged in France.)    Is wine included in your regular charges? (And it generally is except  in the two above-mentioned instances.)    Have you a sign denoting adherence or alliance to the A. G. A.?    Have you a sign denoting adherence or alliance to the A. C. F.?    Have you a sign denoting adherence or alliance to the T. C F.?    Have you an arrangement with the Touring Club de France allowing  members a discount of ten per cent.? (Some four thousand country  hotels of France have.)    Have you a bath-room?    Have you modernized hygienic bedrooms?    Have you water-closets with modern plumbing? (Most important this.)    Have you a dark room for photographers?    Have you a covered garage for automobiles? (This must be free of  charge to travellers, for two days at least, or a mention of the  hotel does not appear.)    How many automobiles can you care for?    Have you a telephone and what is its number?    What is your telegraphic address?    What are the chief curiosities and sights in your town?    What interesting excursions in the neighbourhood?    This information is afterwards compiled and most clearly set forth,  with additional information as to population, railway facilities,  etc.    The annual of the Automobile Club de France marks with a little  silhouetted knife and fork those establishments which deserve mention  for their _cuisine_, and even marks good beds in a similar fashion.  Clearly the makers of old-time guide-books must wake up, or everybody  will take to automobiling, if only to have the right to demand one of  these excellent guides. To be sure the same information might to a  very considerable extent be included in the recognized guide-books;  indeed Joanne's excellent series has in one or two instances added  something of the sort in recent editions of their \"Normandie\" and  \"Provence,\" but each volume deals only with some special locality,  whereas the Guide-Michelin deals with the whole of France, and the  house also issues another covering Belgium, Holland, and the Rhine  country.    The chief concern of the touring automobilist, after the pleasures of  the road, is the choice of a hotel. The days when the diligences of  Europe drew up before an old-time inn, with the sign of a pewter  plate, an _ecu d'or_, a holly branch, or a prancing white horse, have  long since disappeared. The classic good cheer of other days, a fowl  and a bottle of Beaune, a baron of beef and porter, or a carp and  good Rhine wine have gone, too. The automobile traveller requires, if  not a stronger fare, at least a more varied menu, as he does a more  ample supply of water for washing.    These quaint old inns of other days, with fine mullioned windows,  galleried courtyards, and vine-trellised facades, still exist here  and there, but they have been much modernized, else they would not  exist at all. There is not much romance in the make-up of the modern  traveller, at least so far as his own comfort is concerned, and the  tired automobilist who has covered two hundred kilometres of road,  between lunch and dinner, requires something more heroic in the way  of a bath than can be had in a tiny porcelain basin, and a more  comfortable place to sit in than the average bar-parlour, such as he  finds in most country inns in England.    As Sterne said: \"They do things better in France,\" and the  accommodation supplied the automobilist is there far ahead of what  one gets elsewhere.    The hotel demanded by the twentieth-century traveller need not  necessarily be a palace, but it must be something which caters to the  advancing needs of the time in a more efficient manner than the  country inn of the eighteenth century, when the only one who  travelled in comfort was he who thrust himself upon the hospitality  of friends.    We are living in a hygienic age, and to-day we are particular about  things that did not in the least concern our forefathers. In England  there is no public-spirited body which takes upon itself the task of  pointing out the virtuous path to the country Boniface. The  Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland has not succeeded very  well with its task as yet and has not anything like the influence of  its two sister organizations in France, or the very efficient Touring  Club Italiano.    Hygiene does not necessarily go so far as to demand a doctor's  certificate as to the health of the birds and animals which the  _chef_ presents so artistically in his celebrated _plats du jour_,  and one need not take the _journaux comiques_ too seriously, as once  did a gouty _milord_, who insisted that his duckling Rouennais  should, while alive, first be certificated as to the health of its  _bronches_ and _poumons_. All the same one likes to know that due  regard is given to the proprieties and necessities of his bedroom,  and to know that the kitchen is more or less a public apartment where  one can see what is going on, which one can almost invariably do in  France, in the country, at any rate. Therein lies one of the great  charms of the French hotel.    One of the latest moves of the Automobile Club de France is to call  attention to the mountainous districts of France, the Pyrenees, and  the Jura, and to exploit them as rivals to Switzerland. Further, a  competition among hotel-keepers has been started throughout France,  and a prize of ten thousand francs is offered yearly to that  hotel-keeper who has added most to the attractions of his house. The  club authorities furnish expert advice and recommendations as to  hotel reforms to any hotel-keeper who applies. In England the newly  established \"Road Club\" might promote the interests of British motor  tourists, and the large numbers of Americans and foreigners, by  undertaking a similar work.    To a great extent the tourist, by whatever means of travel, must find  his hotels out for himself. He cannot always follow a guide-book, and  if he does he may find that the endorsement of an old edition is no  longer merited.    By far the best hotel-guides for France, Belgium, and Holland, the  Rhine, Switzerland, and Italy are the excellent _annuaires_ of the  Automobile Clubs and Touring Clubs, and the before-mentioned  Guide-Michelin and \"Guide-Routiere Continental,\" issued by the great  pneumatic tire companies.    Hotel-finding abroad, for the stranger, is a more or less difficult  process, or he makes it such. The crowded resorts do not give one a  tithe of the character or local colour to be had from a stay in some  little market-town inn of France or Germany. In the former, hotels  are simply bad imitations of Parisian establishments, while the best  are often off the beaten track in the small towns.    The question of tipping is an ever present one for the European  traveller. It exists in Britain and Continental Europe to an  increasing and exasperating extent, and the advent of the automobile  has done nothing to lessen it.    There is no earthly, sensible logic which should induce a _garcon_ in  a hotel or restaurant to think that because one arrives in an  automobile he wishes to dine in a"]]]
