Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value  of it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for  them to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves,  before we met here, I believe. Open the bundle, Joe.\"    But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in  faded black, mounting the breach first, produced _his_ plunder. It was  not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve buttons,  and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined  and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give  for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found  that there was nothing more to come.    \"That's your account,\" said Joe, \"and I wouldn't give another sixpence,  if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who's next?\"    Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two  old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots.  Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.    \"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine, and that's  the way I ruin myself,\" said old Joe. \"That's your account. If you asked  me for another penny, and made it an open question, I'd repent of being  so liberal, and knock off half-a-crown.\"    \"And now undo _my_ bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman.    Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it,  and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large heavy roll  of some dark stuff.    \"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed curtains!\"    \"Ah!\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed  arms. \"Bed curtains!\"    \"You don't mean to say you took 'em down rings and all, with him lying  there?\" said Joe.    \"Yes, I do,\" replied the woman. \"Why not?\"    \"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and you'll certainly do  it.\"    \"I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by  reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as he was, I promise you,  Joe,\" returned the woman coolly. \"Don't drop that oil upon the blankets,  now.\"    \"His blankets?\" asked Joe.    \"Whose else's do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He isn't likely to take  cold without 'em, I dare say.\"    \"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?\" said old Joe, stopping  in his work, and looking up.    \"Don't you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I an't so fond of  his company that I'd loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah!  you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find  a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine  one too. They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.\"    \"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe.    \"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied the woman with  a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If  calico ain't good enough for such a purpose, it isn't good enough for  anything. It's quite as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than  he did in that one.\"    Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about  their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he  viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been  greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse  itself.    \"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag  with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. \"This is  the end of it, you see? He frightened everyone away from him when he was  alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha! ha! ha!\"    \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot, \"I see, I see. The  case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way, now.  Merciful Heaven, what is this?\"    He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost  touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a ragged  sheet, there lay a something covered up which, though it was dumb,  announced itself in awful language.    The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,  though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,  anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light rising in the  outer air, fell straight upon the bed: and on it, plundered and bereft,  unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.    Scrooge glanced toward the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the  head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of  it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the  face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to  do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the  spectre at his side.    \"Spirit!\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not  leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\"    Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.    \"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do it if I could. But  I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.\"    Again it seemed to look upon him.    \"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this  man's death,\" said Scrooge, quite agonized, \"show that person to me,  Spirit, I beseech you!\"    The phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;  and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her  children were.    She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked  up and down the room; started at every sound; looked out from the  window; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with her  needle; and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play.    At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door and  met her husband; a man whose face was care-worn and depressed, though he  was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of  serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to  repress.    He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,  and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a  long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.    \"Is it good,\" she said, \"or bad?\"--to help him.    \"Bad,\" he answered.    \"We are quite ruined?\"    \"No. There is hope yet, Caroline.\"    \"If _he_ relents,\" she said, amazed, \"there is! Nothing is past hope, if  such a miracle has happened.\"    \"He is past relenting,\" said her husband. \"He is dead.\"    She was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth; but she  was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped  hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry: but the  first was the emotion of her heart.    \"What the half-drunken woman, whom I told you of last night, said to  me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay: and what I  thought was a mere excuse to avoid me, turns out to have been quite  true. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.\"    \"To whom will our debt be transferred?\"    \"I don't know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money;  and even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so  merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light  hearts, Caroline!\"    Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's  faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little  understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's  death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the  event, was one of pleasure.    \"Let me see some tenderness connected with the death,\" said Scrooge; \"or  that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever  present to me.\"    The Ghost conducted him through several streets to poor Bob Cratchit's  house; the dwelling he had visited before: and found the mother and the  children seated round the fire.    Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues  in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.  The mother and her daughters were sewing. But surely they were very  quiet!    \"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.'\"    Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy  must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why  did he not go on?    The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her  face.    \"The color hurts my eyes,\" she said.    The color? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!    \"They're better now again,\" said Cratchit's wife. \"It makes them weak by  candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes  home, for the world. It must be near his time.\"    \"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book. \"But I think he  has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings,  mother.\"    They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful  voice, that only faltered once:    \"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon  his shoulder, very fast indeed.\"    \"And so have I,\" cried Peter. \"Often.\"    \"And so have I,\" exclaimed another. So had all.    \"But he was very light to carry,\" she resumed, intent upon her work,  \"and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And  there is your father at the door!\"    She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter--he had  need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him, and they  all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits  got upon his knees and laid, each child, a little cheek against his  face, as if they said, \"Don't mind it, father. Don't be grieved!\"    Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.

Two of these  thermometers are placed in the dome of the calorimeter immediately over  the shoulders of the subject, and the other three are distributed around  the sides and front of the chamber. This type of construction gives  maximum sensibility to the temperature fluctuations of the air itself  and yet insures thorough protection. The two terminals are carried  outside of the respiration chamber to the observer's table, where the  temperature fluctuations are measured on a Wheatstone bridge.      WALL THERMOMETERS.    The wall thermometers are designed for the purpose of taking the  temperature of the copper wall rather than the temperature of the air.  When temperature fluctuations are being experienced inside of the  respiration chamber, the air obviously shows temperature fluctuations  first, and the copper walls are next affected. Since in making  corrections for the hydrothermal equivalent of the apparatus and for  changes in the temperature of the apparatus as a whole it is desirable  to know the temperature changes of the wall rather than the air, these  wall thermometers were installed for this special purpose. In  construction they are not unlike the thermometers used in the air, but  instead of being surrounded by perforated metal they are encased in  copper boxes soldered directly to the wall. Five such thermometers are  used in series and, though attached permanently to the wall, they are  placed in relatively the same position as the air thermometers. The two  terminals are conducted through the metal walls to the observer's table,  where variations in resistance are measured. The resistance of the five  thermometers is not far from 20 ohms.      ELECTRICAL RECTAL THERMOMETER.    The resistance thermometer used for measuring the temperature of the  body of the man is of a somewhat different type, since it is necessary  to wind the coil in a compact form, inclose it in a pure silver tube,  and connect it with suitable rubber-covered connections, so that it can  be inserted deep in the rectum. The apparatus has been described in a  number of publications.[9] The resistance of this system is also not far  from 20 ohms, thus simplifying the use of the apparatus already  installed on the observer's table.      ELECTRIC-RESISTANCE THERMOMETERS FOR THE WATER-CURRENT.    The measurement of the temperature differences of the water-current by  the electric-resistance thermometer was tried a number of years ago by  Rosa,[10] but the results were not invariably satisfactory and in all  the subsequent experimenting the resistance thermometer could not be  used with satisfaction. More recently, plans were made to incorporate  some of the results of the rapidly accumulating experience in the use of  resistance thermometers and consequently an electric-resistance  thermometer was devised to meet the conditions of experimentation with  the respiration calorimeter by Dr. E. F. Northrup, of the Leeds &  Northrup Company, of Philadelphia. The conditions to be met were that  the thermometers should take rapidly the temperature of the ingoing and  outcoming water and that the fluctuations in temperature difference as  measured by the resistance thermometers should be controlled for  calibration purposes by the differences in temperature of the mercurial  thermometers.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Details of resistance thermometers for  water-circuit. Upper part of figure shows a sketch of the outside of the  hard-rubber case. In lower part is a section showing interior  construction. Flattened lead tube wound about central brass tube  contains the resistance wire. A is enlarged part of the case forming a  chamber for the mercury bulb. Arrows indicate direction of flow on  resistance thermometer for ingoing water.]    For the resistance thermometer, Dr. Northrup has used, instead of  copper, pure nickel wire, which has a much higher resistance and thus  enables a much greater total resistance to be inclosed in a given space.  The insulated nickel wire is wound in a flattened spiral and then passed  through a thin lead tube flattened somewhat. This lead tube is then  wound around a central core and the flattened portions attached at such  an angle that the water passing through the tubes has a tendency to be  directed away from the center and against the outer wall, thus insuring  a mixing of the water. Space is left for the insertion of the mercurial  thermometer. With the thermometer for the ingoing water, it was found  necessary to extend the bulb somewhat beyond the resistance coil, so  that the water might be thoroughly mixed before reaching the bulb and  thus insure a steady temperature. Thus it was found necessary to enlarge  the chamber A (fig. 16) somewhat and the tube leading out of the  thermometer, so that the bulb of the thermometer itself could be placed  almost directly at the opening of the exit tube. Under these conditions  perfect mixing of water and constancy of temperature were obtained.    In the case of the thermometer which measured the outcoming water, the  difficulty was not so great, as the outcoming water is somewhat nearer  the temperature of the chamber, and the water as it leaves the  thermometer passes first over the mercurial thermometer and then over  the resistance thermometer. By means of a long series of tests it was  found possible to adjust these resistance thermometers so that the  variations in resistance were in direct proportion to the temperature  changes noted on the mercurial thermometers. Obviously, these  differences in resistance of the two thermometers can be measured  directly with the Wheatstone bridge, but, what is more satisfactory,  they are measured and recorded directly on a special type of automatic  recorder described beyond.      OBSERVER'S TABLE.    The measurements of the temperature of the respiration chamber, of the  water-current, and of the body temperature of the man, as well as the  heating and cooling of the air-spaces about the calorimeter, are all  under the control of the physical assistant. The apparatus for these  temperature controls and measurements is all collected compactly on a  table, the so-called \"observer's table.\" At this, the physical assistant  sits throughout the experiments. For convenience in observing the  mercurial thermometers in the water-current and general inspection of  the whole apparatus, this table is placed on an elevated platform, shown  in fig. 3. Directly in front of the table the galvanometer is suspended  from the ceiling and a black hood extends from the observer's table to  the galvanometer itself. On the observer's table proper are all the  electrical connections and at the left are the mercurial thermometers  for the chair calorimeter. Formerly, when the method of alternately  cooling and heating the air-spaces was used, the observer was able to  open and close the water-valves without leaving the chair.    The observer's table is so arranged electrically as to make possible  temperature control and measurement of either of the two calorimeters.  It is impossible, however, for the observer to read the mercurial  thermometers in the bed calorimeter without leaving his chair, and  likewise he must occasionally alter the cooling water flowing through  the outer air-spaces by going to the bed calorimeter itself. The  installation of the electric-resistance thermometers connected with the  temperature recorder does away with the reading of the mercurial  thermometers, save for purposes of comparison, and hence it is  unnecessary for the assistant to leave the chair at the observer's table  when the bed calorimeter is in use. Likewise the substitution of the  method of continuously cooling somewhat the air-spaces and reheating  with electricity, mentioned on page 18, does away with the necessity for  alternately opening and closing the water-valves of the chair  calorimeter placed at the left of the observer's table.

A diagrammatic representation of the observer's table with  its connections is shown in fig. 17. The heavy black outline gives in a  general way the outline of the table proper and thus shows a  diagrammatic distribution of the parts. The first of the electrical  measurements necessary during experiments is that of the  thermo-electric effect of the thermal junction systems installed on the  calorimeters. To aid in indicating what parts of the zinc wall need  cooling or heating, the thermal junction systems are, as has already  been described, separated into four sections on the chair calorimeter  and three sections on the bed calorimeter; in the first calorimeter, the  top, front, rear, and bottom; in the bed calorimeter, the top, sides,  and bottom.
