Urbanity is half of affability, and affability is a charm worth possessing.    2. A pleasing demeanor is often the scales by which the pagan weighs the  Christian. It is not virtue, but virtue inspires it. There are  circumstances in which it takes a great and strong soul to pass under the  little yoke of courtesy, but it is a passport to a greater soul standard.    3. Matthew Arnold says, \"Conduct is three-fourths of character,\" and  Christian benignity draws the line for conduct. A high sense of rectitude,  a lowly soul, with a pure and kind {50} heart are elements of nobility  which will work out in the life of a human being at home--everywhere.  \"Private refinement makes public gentility.\"    4. If you would conciliate the favor of men, rule your resentment. Remember  that if you permit revenge or malice to occupy your soul, you are ruined.    5. Cultivate a happy temper; banish the blues; a cheerful saguine spirit  begets cheer and hope.    6. Be trustworthy and be trustful.    7. Do not place a light estimate upon the arts of good reading and good  expression; they will yield perpetual interest.    8. Study to keep versed in world events as well as in local occurrences,  but abhor gossip, and above all scandal.    9. Banish a self-conscience spirit--the source of much awkwardness--with a  constant aim to make others happy. Remember that it is incumbent upon  gentlemen and ladies alike to be neat in habits.    10. The following is said to be a correct posture for walking. Head  erect--not too rigid--chin in, shoulders back. Permit no unnecessary motion  about the thighs. Do not lean over to one side in walking, standing or  sitting; the practice is not only ungraceful, but it is deforming and  therefore unhealthful.    11. Beware of affectation and of Beau Brummel airs.    12. If the hands are allowed to swing in walking, the arc should be  limited, and the lady will manage them much more gracefully, if they almost  touch the clothing.    13. A lady should not stand with her hands behind her. We could almost say,  forget the hands except to keep them clean, including the nails, cordial  and helpful. One hand may rest easily in the other. Study repose of  attitude here as well as in the rest of the body.    14. Gestures are for emphasis in public speaking; do not point elsewhere,  as a rule.    15. Greet your acquaintances as you meet them with a slight bow and smile,  as you speak.    16. Look the person to whom you speak in the eye. Never under any  circumstances wink at another or communicate by furtive looks.    17. Should you chance to be the rejected suitor of a lady, bear in mind  your own self-respect, as well as the inexorable laws {51} of society, and  bow politely when you meet her. Reflect that you do not stand before all  woman-kind as you do at her bar. Do not resent the bitterness of  flirtation. No lady or gentleman will flirt. Remember ever that painful  prediscovery is better than later disappointment. Let such experience spur  you to higher exertion.    18. Discretion should be exercised in introducing persons. Of two gentlemen  who are introduced, if one is superior in rank or age, he is the one to  whom the introduction should be made. Of two social equals, if one be a  stranger in the place, his name should be mentioned first.    19. In general the simpler the introduction the better.    20. Before introducing a gentleman to a lady, remember that she is entitled  to hold you responsible for the acquaintance. The lady is the one to whom  the gentleman is presented, which may be done thus: \"Miss A, permit me to  introduce to you my friend, Mr. B.\"; or, \"Miss A., allow me to introduce  Mr. B.\" If mutual and near friends of yours, say simply, \"Miss A., Mr. B.\"    21. Receive the introduction with a slight bow and the acknowledgment,  \"Miss A., I am happy to make your acquaintance\"; or, \"Mr. B., I am pleased  to meet you.\" There is no reason why such stereotyped expressions should  always be used, but something similar is expected. Do not extend the hand  usually.    22. A true lady will avoid familiarity in her deportment towards gentlemen.  A young lady should not permit her gentlemen friends to address her by her  home name, and the reverse is true. Use the title Miss and Mr.  respectively.    23. Ladies should be frank and cordial towards their lady friends, but  never gushing.    24. Should you meet a friend twice or oftener, at short intervals, it is  polite to bow slightly each time after the first.    25. A lady on meeting a gentleman with whom she has slight acquaintance  will make a medium bow--neither too decided nor too slight or stiff.    26. For a gentleman to take a young lady's arm, is to intimate that she is  feeble, and young ladies resent the mode.    27. If a young lady desires to visit any public place where she expects to  meet a gentleman acquaintance, she should have a chaperon to accompany her,  a person of mature years when possible, and never a giddy girl.    28. A lady should not ask a gentleman to walk with her.           *       *       *       *       *      {52}    [Illustration]    A COMPLETE ETIQUETTE IN A FEW PRACTICAL RULES.    _1. If you desire to be respected, keep clean. The finest attire and  decorations will add nothing to the appearance or beauty of an untidy  person._    _2. Clean clothing, clean skin, clean hands, including the nails, and  clean, white teeth, are a requisite passport for good society._    _3. A bad breath should be carefully remedied, whether it proceeds from the  stomach or from decayed teeth._    _4. To pick the nose, finger about the ears, or scratch the head or any  other part of the person, in company, is decidedly vulgar._    _5. When you call at any private residence, do not neglect to clean your  shoes thoroughly._    _6. A gentleman should always remove his hat in the presence of ladies,  except out of doors, and then he should lift or touch his hat in  salutation. On meeting a lady a well-bred gentleman will always lift his  hat._    _7. An invitation to a lecture, concert, or other entertainment, may be  either verbal or written, but should always be made at least twenty-four  hours before the time._ {53}    _8. On entering a hall or church the gentleman should precede the lady in  walking up the aisle, or walk by her side, if the aisle is broad enough._    _9. A gentleman should always precede a lady upstairs, and follow her  downstairs._    _10. Visitors should always observe the customs of the church with  reference to standing, sitting, or kneeling during the services._    _11. On leaving a hall or church at the close of entertainment or services,  the gentleman should precede the lady._    _12. A gentleman walking with a lady should carry the parcels, and never  allow the lady to be burdened with anything of the kind._    _13. A gentleman meeting a lady on the street and wishing to speak to her,  should never detain her, but may turn around and walk in the same direction  she is going, until the conversation is completed._    _14. If a lady is traveling with a gentleman, simply as a friend, she  should place the amount of her expenses in his hands, or insist on paying  the bills herself._    _15. Never offer a lady costly gifts unless you are engaged to her, for it  looks as if you were trying to purchase her goodwill; and when you make a  present to a lady use no ceremony whatever._    [Illustration: Children should early be taught the lesson of Propriety and  Good Manners.]    _16. Never carry on a private conversation in company. If secrecy is  necessary, withdraw from the company._    _17. Never sit with your back to another without asking to be excused._    _18. It is as unbecoming for a gentleman to sit with legs crossed as it is  for a lady._    _19. Never thrum with your fingers, rub your hands, yawn, or sigh aloud in  company._    _20. Loud laughter, loud talking, or other boisterous manifestations should  be checked in the society of others, especially on the street and in public  places._ {54}    _21. When you are asked to sing or play in company, do so without being  urged, or refuse in a way that shall be final; and when music is being  rendered in company, show politeness to the musician by giving attention.  It is very impolite to keep up a conversation. If you do not enjoy the  music, keep silent._    _22. Contentions, contradictions, etc., in society should be carefully  avoided._    _23. Pulling out your watch in company, unless asked the time of day, is a  mark of the demi-bred. It looks as if you were tired of the company and the  time dragged heavily._    _24. You should never decline to be introduced to any one or all of the  guests present at a party to which you have been invited._    _25. A gentleman who escorts a lady to a party, or who has a lady placed  under his care, is under particular obligations to attend to her wants and  see that she has proper attention. He should introduce her to others, and  endeavor to make the evening pleasant. He should escort her to the supper  table and provide for her wants._    _26. To take small children or dogs with you on a visit of ceremony is  altogether vulgar, though in visiting familiar friends, children are not  objectionable._           *       *       *       *       *      {55} [Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN BRIDE'S WEDDING OUTFIT.]    {56}    ETIQUETTE OF CALLS.    [Illustration]    In the matter of making calls it is the correct thing:    For the caller who arrived first to leave first.    To return a first call within a week and in person.    To call promptly and in person after a first invitation.    For the mother or chaperon to invite a gentleman to call.    To call within a week after any entertainment to which one has been  invited.    You should call upon an acquaintance who has recently returned from a  prolonged absence.

Drew found his new mount had no easy shuffle like  Shawnee's. The gelding was a black with three white feet and a proudly  held head--might even be Denmark stock--but for some reason he didn't  relish moving in company. And, left without close enough supervision  from his rider, he tended either to trot ahead or loiter until he was  out of line. Drew was continually either reining him in or urging him  on.    \"Kinda a raw one,\" Kirby commented critically. \"He ain't no  rockin'-chair hoss, that's for sure. If I was you, I'd look round for  somethin' better to slap m' tree on--\"    Drew pulled rein for the tenth time, his exasperation growing. \"I might  do just that.\" Shawnee had been worth fifty of this temperamental  blooded hunter.    \"You take Tejano heah. He's a rough-coated ol' snorter--nothin' to make  an hombre's eyes bug out--but he takes you way over yonder, an' then he  brings you back ... nothin' more you can ask.\"    Drew agreed. \"Lost my horse back at the river,\" he said briefly. \"This  was a pickup--\"    \"Tough luck!\" Kirby was sincerely sympathetic. \"Funny about you Kaintuck  boys ... mostly you want a high-steppin' pacer with a chief's feathers  sproutin' outta his head. They has to have oats an' corn an' be treated  like they was glass. I'd'ruther have me a range hoss. You can ride one  of 'em from Hell to breakfast--an' maybe a mile or two beyond--an' he  never knows the difference. Work him hard all day, an' maybe the next  mornin' when you're set to fork leather again, he shows you a bellyfull  of bedsprings an' you're unloaded for fair. A hoss like that has him  wind an' power to burn--\"    \"You raised horses before the war?\"    Kirby swallowed what must have been the last soggy crumb of hardtack.  \"Well, we had a mind to try that. M'pa, he started him a spread down  Pecos way. He had him a good stud-quarter hoss--one of Steel Dust's git.  Won two or three races, that stud did. Called him Kiowa. Pa made a deal  with a Mex mustanger; he got some prime stuff he caught in the  Panhandle. One mare, I 'member--she was a natcherel pacer. Yeah, you  might say as how we was gittin' a start at a first-rate string. Me an'  m' brothers, we was breakin' some right pretty colts...\"    His voice trailed into silence. Drew reined in the black again and asked  another question:    \"What happened ... the war?\"    \"What happened? Well, you might say as how Comanches happened. Me, I was  trailin' 'long with this Mex mustanger to learn some of his tricks. When  I came back, theah jus' warn't nothin'--nothin' a man wants to remember  after. Someday I'm gonna hunt me Comanches. Gonna learn me some tricks  in this heah war I can use in that business!\" There was no change in  his expression. If anything, his drawl was a little softer and lazier,  but the deadly promise in it reached Drew as clearly as if the other had  burst out with the Rebel Yell.    \"This is it!\" Captain Campbell rode back along their line. It was a  larger company; they had gathered in more fugitives this morning and had  no stragglers. All they lacked was adequate arms to present a rather  formidable source of trouble behind the Union lines. \"We're goin' into  the McKeever place. You men--remember, you're prisoners!\"    Very reluctantly those in that unhappy role unbuckled gun belts, passing  their side arms over to their \"captors.\" There was a graveled drive  branching out of the pike to their right with a grove of trees arching  over it, so they rode into a restful green twilight out of the punishing  sun.    Fields rippled lushly beyond that border of trees. There was a  cleanness, a contentment, a satisfaction about this place which was no  part of them or any men who passed so, armed, restless, tearing apart  just such peace as enfolded them here. They rode out of urgency when the  gravel of that well-raked drive shifted under the hoofs of their mounts.    \"I'm sayin' one thing loud an' clear,\" Kirby announced to those in his  immediate vicinity as they neared a big brick house. \"I may be playin'  prisoner to you boys, but I ain't settlin' for no prisoner's rations. We  all eat full plates in heah, let that be understood from the start.\"    Campbell laughed. \"Noted, Kirby. We'll see that you desperate Rebs get  all that's comin' to you.\"    \"Now that, Cap'n, is jus' what I'm afraid of. We git all that's  _comin'_--that sounds a right smart better!\"    \"Company ahead, Cap'n!\" The trooper who had suggested this action,  indicated a man walking down the drive to meet their cavalcade.    \"That's Mr. McKeever.\" Drew identified their host for Campbell.    But the captain was already moving ahead to meet the older man. He  touched fingers to kepi--a neat blue kepi--in a smart salute.    \"Chivers, Captain, Eleventh Ohio, sir. We'd like to make our noon halt  here if you'll grant permission.\"    Thomas McKeever beamed. \"No reason not, suh. Take your men over in the  orchard, Captain. We can add a little something to your rations. Glad,  always glad to entertain our boys.\" His attention wandered to the score  of \"prisoners\" in the center of the troop.    \"Prisoners, Captain?\"    \"Some of Morgan's horse thieves.\" Campbell glanced back at the shabby  exhibit. \"You've heard the news, of course, sir? We smashed 'em proper  over at Cynthiana--\"    \"You did? Now that's good hearin', Captain. It deserves a regular  celebration; it surely does. Morgan smashed! Was he taken too? Next time  I trust they'll put him in something stronger than that jail you Ohio  boys had him in last time; he's a slippery one.\"    \"Haven't heard about that, sir. But his men are pretty well scattered.  These aren't going to trouble any one for a while.\"    McKeever nodded. \"I've a stout barn you're welcome to use for a  temporary lockup, Captain. Though I must say they don't display much  spirit, do they? Look pretty well beat.\"    Drew rubbed his hand across his face, hoping the grime there--a mixture  of road dust, sweat, and powder blacking--was an effective disguise. No  use recalling the old days for Mr. McKeever. Allowing his shoulders to  slump dispiritedly as he was herded by his file guard, he rode sullenly  on to the orchard.    They stripped their saddles and allowed the horses freedom for the first  time in hours, an act which was against prudence but which McKeever  would expect of Union troops. Drew lay full length under the curving  limbs of an apple tree, his head pillowed on saddlebags.    \"Now I wonder\"--Kirby dropped down, to sit with his back against the  tree trunk--\"why they always say a fella is dog-tired. A dog, he ain't  got him much to do 'cept chase around on his own business.  Soldier-tired--now that's another matter. How 'bout it, kid? You ready  to ride right outta heah an' chase General Grant clean back to Lake  Erie?\"    Boyd had stretched out only a hand's length from Drew. There were dark  smudges under his closed eyes, hardly to be told from the smears of dirt  on his round cheeks, but there. He rolled his head on a hammock of grass  and scowled at Kirby.    \"General Grant can--\" he added a remark which surprised Drew into  opening his eyes. Kirby shook his head reprovingly.    \"Now that ain't no way for a growin' boy to talk. An' it sits on your  tongue as easy as a fly on a mule's ear, too. What kinda company you bin  keepin', kid? Rennie, this heah colt ain't got no reason to cram grammar  into a remark that way.\"    Drew stretched, folded his arms under his head, and answered, in a voice  he tried to make as blighting as possible: \"Thinks it makes him sound  like a man, probably. He's findin' out the army ain't quite what he  expected.\"    \"You shut up--!\" Boyd might have added something to that, but Drew had  moved. He leaned over the youngster, his hand hard and heavy on Boyd's  shoulder. And it was plain that, much as he wanted to, the other did not  quite dare to move or shake off that grip.    \"I've had about enough,\" Drew said quietly. \"The next town we hit you're  goin' to stay there, until someone comes from back home to collect you.  Nobody knows you're with us, and you can go back to Oak Hill without any  trouble from Union troops.\"    Boyd's eyes blazed. His mouth wasn't shaping a small boy's pout this  time; it was an ugly line tight against his teeth.    \"I ain't goin' home! I said you can't make me, 'less you tie me on a  horse and keep me tied all the way. And I don't think you can do that,  Drew Rennie. I'd like to see you try it; I sure would!\"    \"He's got you on a stand-off, I'd say,\" Kirby remarked. \"My, ain't he  the tough one though, horns sticking up an' haired all over!  Gentlemen--\" he had glanced over their shoulder and was watching  whatever was there--\"company comin'. Mind your manners!\"    Drew looked around. His hand clamped tighter on Boyd, keeping him pinned  on his back. If he only had time ... but there was no way of disguising  the younger boy. And Thomas McKeever, strolling with Captain Campbell,  had already sighted them, stopped short, and now was moving swiftly in  their direction.    \"Boyd Barrett!\"    Drew had to release his hold and Boyd sat up, brushing bits of grass  from his shirt sleeves even as he returned Mr. McKeever's stare with  composure.    \"Yes, suh?\" Boyd was on his feet now, making his manners with the speed  of one harboring a guilty conscience.    \"What are you doing with this gang of cutthroats and banditti?\" Mr.  McKeever had an excellent voice to deliver such an inquiry; it could  rattle the unaware into confusion, and sometimes even into quick  confession, as he undoubtedly knew.    \"I'm with General Morgan, Mr. McKeever.\" Boyd did not appear too  ruffled.    \"I refuse to believe that even that unprincipled ruffian is robbing  cradles to fill up his ranks, depleted as they may "]]]
