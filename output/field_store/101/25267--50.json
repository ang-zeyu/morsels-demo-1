I tell them it is impossible to do so many things well.  If they wish to learn music, this is not the place for them. They may  practise a little,--an hour or two a day, if they wish,--but it is  folly to attempt the study of music with other things. We aim to give  a thorough training in language and literature; not a smattering, but  such an acquaintance as will enable them to understand the people  whose tongue they study,--to look at life through their eyes, and to  be thoroughly familiar with the masterpieces of their literature. Of  course, German holds the first place, but French and English are also  taught.\" I was taken to a class in German literature. The plain and  primitive furnishing of the class-rooms was in noticeable contrast to  the elegance of the parlors. The girls sat on plain wooden benches,  with desks before them on which their note-books lay open. They used  these as those who had been trained to take notes and recite from  them. I had been told that the teacher in charge of this class was one  of the most excellent in the city. The hour was occupied by a lecture  on Lessing, a poet whom the class were evidently studying with German  minuteness.    I also visited a class in reading,--younger girls, about ten or twelve  years of age. They were admirably taught, both in reading and  memorizing, the latter chiefly of German ballads. I saw no better  teaching done in Berlin than that of this class. Its enthusiastic lady  teacher would be a treasure in any land. The last visit of the morning  was to a class in vocal music, taught by a gentleman. It was  interesting as affording a view of the methods in this music-loving  country, but did not differ materially from what would be considered  good instruction and drill on this side the water. The teacher himself  played the piano, the pupils standing in rows on either side.    In the teachers' dressing-room, a comfortable apartment for the  teachers who came from without the building, I chatted a few moments  with two or three ladies. One spoke English so well that I asked if it  were her vernacular. She appeared gratified by the compliment; said  she had been much in other continental countries, and had spent three  years in England, with eighteen months beside in the United States.  She mistook me for an Englishwoman, and confidently informed me that  she had feared her English accent was ruined by the time spent \"in the  States.\" \"Did you find it so?\" I inquired. \"No,\" she said;  \"fortunately I was able to correct it by stopping in England on my way  back.\" She had evidently not met the gentleman who informed his  English friends that they must go to Boston, Massachusetts, if they  would hear English spoken correctly. While in Berlin I heard of a  young American who was accosted by an Englishman with a question as to  what language she spoke. \"I speak American,\" was the reply, \"but I can  understand English if it is spoken slowly.\"    The wish to learn English is almost universal among Germans, and the  schools have not been before public opinion in making it a part of the  curriculum. The result as yet, however, judging from our observation,  will justify greater painstaking and more practice, before a high  degree of accuracy is reached among the pupils.          IV.    CHURCHES.      The greatest Protestant power of Continental Europe has no  Court-churches worthy in appearance of companionship with its palaces  and public buildings. But there are those of much historical and other  interest, and in some of them the living power of Christianity bears  sway. The _Dom_, or Cathedral, dating from the time of Frederick the  Great, is far inferior, within and without, to the magnificent  buildings which surround it, facing the _Lustgarten_, or Esplanade.  Long ago royal plans were made to replace it by an edifice more  worthy, but these have not been carried out, though since the  accession of Emperor William II. measures have been taken looking  toward the erection of a new cathedral.    The usual hour for Sunday-morning service is ten o'clock. The latitude  of Berlin is over ten degrees farther north than that of New York and  Chicago, and the sun at ten o'clock in winter is about as high as at  nine o'clock in the latter cities. So it is only by special effort  that a midwinter sojourner in Berlin can be at morning service. Within  three minutes of the time appointed, on my first visit, the aged  Emperor William entered the _Dom_ and stood for a few minutes in the  attitude of devotion, as did the other members of the Imperial  household. The gallery on the left of the preacher was occupied by  three boxes,--one for the Emperor, one for the Crown Prince and his  family, and one for their retinues. The service proceeded in the  language of the people,--that language created and preserved to  Germany by Luther's translation of the Bible. A finely trained choir  of some sixty singers led the music, all the people joining in the  psalms and hymns; the Imperial family taking part in the service with  simplicity and appearance of sincerity, as those who stood, with all  present, in the presence of Him with whom is no respect of persons.  The plain interior of the _Dom_ has a painting behind the altar, and  the large candles in immense candlesticks on either side were burning  before a crucifix throughout the entire service. This we found true  also in most of the other churches,--a reminder that, wide as was the  gulf between the Lutheran Church and that of Rome, the former retained  some customs which Puritanism discarded. Pews fill the central part of  this cathedral, and the broad aisle skirting the side at the left of  the front entrance has a few seats for the delicate and infirm of the  throng which always stands there at the time for the morning service.    It was in this church that the departed Emperor William I. lay in  state for the great funeral pageant when his ninety-one years of life  were over. Here in the vaults many members of Prussia's royal family  repose, and here many stately ceremonies have taken place. At the door  of this cathedral Emperor William I., then Prince Regent, stood with  uncovered head to receive the remains of Alexander Von Humboldt, which  here lay in state in May, 1859, after the great scholar \"went forth\"  for the last time from his home in the Oranienburger Strasse.    We attended a service at the oldest of the Berlin churches, the  Nicolai Kirche, and found the sparseness of the audience in striking  contrast with the crowds which frequented most of the other churches  where we went. Standing-room is usually at a premium in the Cathedral,  the Garrison Church, and the place, wherever it may be, in which  Dryander preaches; and in nearly all the churches unoccupied seats are  hard to find. This is due, not to the large numbers of church-going  people in Berlin, but to the comparatively limited church  accommodations. It is not too soon that the present Emperor has given  order that the number of churches and sittings be immediately  increased. In this city of about a million and a half inhabitants,  there are only about seventy-five churches and chapels, all told; none  very large, and some quite small. It is said that Dryander's parish  numbers forty thousand souls, and that there are other parishes  including eighty thousand and one hundred and twenty thousand each.  Only about two per cent of the population attend church. Ties to a  particular church seem scarcely to exist in many cases; those who go  to Divine service following their favorite preacher from place to  place as he ministers now in one part, now in another, of his vast  parish, or going to the Court Church to see the Imperial family, or to  some other which happens to offer fine music or some special  attraction for the day. Churches do not need, however, to offer  special attractions nor to advertise sensational novelties in order to  be filled, and of course there are many humble and devout Christians  found in the same places from week to week.    The Nicolai Kirche dates from before 1250 A.D. and the great granite  foundations of the towers were laid still earlier. At this period the  savage Wends and the robber-castles of North Germany were yielding to  the prowess of the Knights of the Teutonic Order, and the powerful  Hanseatic League was uniting its free cities and cementing its  commercial interests, of which Berlin was erelong to be a part,--a  League which was to sweep the Baltic by its fleets, and to set up and  dethrone kings by its armies. Already the Crusades had broken the long  sleep of the Dark Ages, and stirred the people with that mighty  impulse which brought the culmination, in the thirteenth century, of  the great church-building epoch of Europe in the Middle Ages. No  great churches which they could not live to finish were begun by he  frugal burghers of Berlin; but they had a style of their own in the  brick Gothic, which is the most truly national architecture of North  Germany. The Nicolai Kirche is a representative of these early times  and of this national architecture, but its interior decorations show  every variety of adornment which prevailed during five centuries after  its founding.

She knew her brother too  well for that, and was sure that his pride would not allow him to return  either to Cheverley or to Harrow in the character of a disappointed  heir. In that respect she could entirely sympathize with him. She and  Dulcie went back to Chilcombe Hall at the beginning of the next week,  and, though all their companions were very kind and sympathetic, it was  humiliating to be obliged to acknowledge that the Chase was no longer  virtually their home. For the present, as the heiress was a minor, the  estate was in the hands of the executors. Mr. Bowden decided to send  Bevis and Clifford to the same preparatory school as Roland, and Cousin  Clare, after various letters and telegrams, departed on a mission to  Sicily, to interview Leslie's mother and stepfather. What the purport of  her visit might be, the girls had as yet no hint.    The weeks dragged wearily on towards Easter. Though Dulcie might throw  herself into hockey or basket ball, to Lilias school interests seemed to  have lost their former zest. She wondered where they were to spend their  holidays. Various friends had extended invitations, but Mr. Bowden, to  whom everything must now be referred, had not yet written to consent. At  last came his reply.    \"I have arranged for you and your sister to spend your holidays as usual  at the Chase. Miss Clare will be arriving back from Sicily, and will  bring your cousin Leslie with her. They would like you to be at home to  receive them.\"    Lilias, showing the letter to Dulcie in the privacy of the Blue bedroom,  simply raged.    \"It's _too_ bad! When we were so keen to go to London, too! Why should  we be there to receive Madame Leslie, I should like to know. I don't  want to see her!\"    \"Neither do I, only I _do_ wonder what she's like, all the same,\"  ventured Dulcie. \"Can she speak English? And will she take over the  whole place, and make us feel it's hers?\"    \"No doubt she will. We shall have to take very back seats indeed! It's  just too disgusting for words. I really think Mr. Bowden needn't have  forced this upon us.\"    \"The girls will be ever so sorry for us!\"    \"I know; and that's just what I hate. I can't bear to be pitied.\"    The Easter exodus seemed very different indeed from the happy breaking  up of last Christmas. No \"Rajah\" and \"Peri\" with glossy coats and  arching necks came to take Lilias and Dulcie from school, and give them  the delight of a ride over the hills, though Milner arrived with the  car, and told them that he was to fetch their three younger brothers on  the following morning. The Chase seemed lonely and deserted with nobody  to welcome them except the servants. It brought back vividly those few  sad days of drawn blinds, and the memory of the long black line slowly  disappearing down the drive. They had supper by themselves, and spent a  very quiet evening reading in the drawing-room. The advent next day of  Roland, Bevis, and Clifford certainly enlivened the atmosphere, and  things would have felt like old times again had it not been for the  shadow of the arrival of the heiress. A telegram had been received from  Cousin Clare announcing the train, and the car was to meet them at the  station on that same evening. Winder and the other servants were  bustling about getting the house in order for its new mistress. A log  fire was lighted in the hall, and plants in pots were carried in from  the conservatory. The Union Jack fluttered from over the porch, and the  gardener had put up some decorations with the word \"Welcome.\"    Five very sober young people stood in the drawing-room and watched as  the car came up the drive to the front door. Next minute they heard  Cousin Clare's cheerful voice calling to them, and they came shyly forth  into the hall.    Standing on the Persian rug in front of the log fire was a girl of about  fourteen, an erect, slender, graceful little figure, with dark silky  hair hanging in loose curls, and wonderful bright eyes that were dark  and yet full of light and seemed to shine like stars. For an instant she  included the Ingletons in one comprehensive glance, then her whole face  broke into eager smiles.    \"I know which of you is which! Lilias, Dulcie, Roland, Bevis, Clifford!\"  she declared, shaking hands with each. \"I'm very rich to have five new  cousins all at once! To-morrow you must show me everything, the rabbits  and the dogs, and the tame jackdaw! Oh yes! I've been hearing about them  and about you! Cousin Clare told me just what you would be like. I kept  asking her questions the whole way!\"    She spoke prettily, and without a trace of a foreign accent; her manner  was warm and friendly. She looked, indeed, as if she would like to kiss  her new relations. She was so entirely different from what the Ingletons  had expected, that in their utter amazement they could think of nothing  to say in reply, and stood gazing at her in embarrassed silence. Cousin  Clare saved the situation.    \"Carmel, child, you're tired out!\" she decreed. \"I'm going to take you  straight upstairs and put you to bed. Thirty-six hours of traveling is  too much for anybody, and you never slept in the train. Come along! You  must make friends with your cousins to-morrow.\"    Long afterwards, when Dulcie tried to analyze her first impressions of  the new-comer, she realized that what struck her most was the extreme  charm of her personality. We have all possibly gone through a similar  psychic experience of meeting somebody against whom we had conceived a  bitter prejudice, and finding our intended hatred suddenly veer round  into love. The effect is like stepping out into what you imagine will be  a blizzard, and finding warm sunshine. The little mistress of the Chase  was very weary with her long journey, but, when at last she was  sufficiently rested to be shown round her demesne, she made her royal  progress with an escort of half-fascinated cousins.    \"You'll like to see your property,\" Lilias began shyly, leading the way  into the garden.    \"_Please_ don't call it mine. I want you all to understand, at the very  beginning, that it's still your home, and I don't wish to take it from  you. I have my own dear home in Sicily, and I hope to go back there some  day. While I'm in England, let me be your visitor. That's all I want. I  can't bear to think that I'm taking anybody's place, or anything that  ought to belong to some one else. If only Mother were here, she'd  explain properly.\"    \"But it _is_ yours, Leslie!\" objected Dulcie.    \"In a way yes, but in another way, no! It can be mine and yours at the  same time. And please will you call me Carmel? Leslie is a boy's name,  not a girl's. I'm always Carmel at home. I didn't want to leave home at  all, but Mother and Daddy said I must go with Cousin Clare when she had  come all the way to Sicily to fetch me. They promised it should be only  a visit.\"    Lilias and Dulcie could hardly believe the evidence of their ears. They  had expected Carmel to be appraising her new property with keen  satisfaction, instead of which she appeared to be suffering from a bad  attack of homesickness. She looked at the gardens, the stables, and all  the pets with interest, but without any apparent sense of  proprietorship. Her behavior was exactly that of an ordinary visitor who  admires a friend's possessions. In her talk she referred constantly to  her home in Sicily, to her stepfather and her younger brothers and  sisters. They and her mother were evidently the supreme center of her  life.    \"We thought you'd only know Italian,\" confided Dulcie, whose shyness was  beginning to wear off.    Carmel laughed.    \"Of course I talk Italian too, but we always speak English at home.  Isn't it strange that mother should have married two Englishmen? I can't  remember my own father at all, but Daddy is a dear, and we're tremendous  friends. I've brought his photo, and Mother's and the children's. I'll  show them to you when I've unpacked.\"    Carmel's astounding attitude, while it amazed her cousins in the  extreme, was certainly highly satisfactory. The boys, when they realized  that she had no desire to wrest their pets from them, waxed suddenly  friendly. With the naive impulsiveness of childhood they gave her a  full account of what they had expected her to be.    \"Perhaps I was rather frightened of you too, till I saw you all,\" she  confessed. \"We've none of us turned out such dreadful bogies, have we?\"    \"Do you know what I'm going to call you?\" said Clifford, slipping a  plump hand into hers, and gazing up into the shining brown eyes.  \"Princess Carmel!\"    And Carmel bent down and kissed him.          CHAPTER VI    Princess Carmel      In the long talk which Cousin Clare had had with Mr. and Mrs. Greville  in Sicily, it had been arranged that Carmel was to be sent to school  with Lilias and Dulcie at Chilcombe Hall. The new term, therefore, saw  her established in a little dressing-room which led out of the Blue  bedroom, and which by good luck happened to be vacated by Evie Hughes,  who had left at Easter. It was soon spread over with Carmel's private  possessions. They were different from the equipment of an ordinary  English schoolgirl, and aroused as much interest as their owner. First  there were the portraits of her mother, of her stepfather, Mr. Greville,  and of the little half-brothers and sisters--Bertram, Nina, Vincent, and  Luigia--taken by an Italian photographer in wonderfully artistic poses,  and with classic backgrounds of pillars and palm trees. Then there were  fascinating snapshots of her home, a white Sicilian house with a  vine-covered veranda, and its lovely half-tropical garden with fountains  and statues and pomegranate blossom, and trees hung with ripe oranges  and lemons. Carmel's things seemed nearly all foreign. Her nightdress  case was of drawn linen beautifully"]]]
