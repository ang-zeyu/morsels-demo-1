[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#9)"],[1,"to  record our conviction that some of the salesladies and shop girls of the  city are thoroughly good, virtuous, honest and respectable. Many of  them, amid unhealthy influences and corroding associations, preserve the  white flower of a blameless life, and become the honored wives of  respectable citizens. But these are a small minority. At the same time  it is useless to disguise the fact that there are others whose character  needs stronger colors for proper delineation than have hitherto been  employed. There are those among pretty shop girls who simply give up  their leisure time to surreptitious appointments. This is the worst and  most dangerous form in which this prevalent vice stalks abroad, and it  more clearly stamps the character of a community than does its more open  and brazen manifestations. Many causes may lead to a woman's becoming a  professional harlot, but if a girl \"goes wrong\" without any very cogent  reason for so doing, there must be something radically unsound in her  composition and inherently bad in her nature to lead her to abandon her  person to the other sex, who are at all times ready to take advantage of  a woman's weakness and a woman's love. Seduction and clandestine  prostitution have made enormous strides in New York, and especially  among the young women and girls connected with stores, within the last  decade.    Not long ago a woman, who then occupied a prominent position in a Sixth  avenue store, was met up-town in the evening. She is very good  looking--strong and lithe and tall, with a cloud of handsome hair that  glistens like bronze; large dreamy eyes that flash and scintillate  witchingly; a handsome, pouting, ruddy mouth; while her neck, white and  statuesque, crowns the full bosom of a goddess. She said that she came  out evenings occasionally to make money, not for the purpose of  subsistence, but to meet debts that her extravagance had caused her to  contract. She said in substance: \"You see my appetite is fastidious, and  I like good eating and drinking. I have the most expensive suppers  sometimes. I am engaged to be married to a young fellow who works on a  daily newspaper and who is busy at night. We shall be married some day,  I suppose. He does, not suspect me to be 'fast,' and you don't suppose I  am going to take the trouble to undeceive him. This is not a frequent  practice of mine; I only come out when I want money, and I always have  an appointment before I come out. I always dress well of course, and can  pick up a gentleman anywhere when I like. Yes, I know I have good feet,  and I know how to use them. I have hooked many a fifty dollars by  showing a couple of inches of my ankle. Of course, I hate being in the  store, but my fellow is rather jealous, and I keep going there as a  blind. Will I reform when I am married? Perhaps so--if he gives me heaps  of money. I am no worse than thousands of girls, single and married, who  put on airs of purity and church-going. I know plenty of ladies who pay  five hundred dollars at the store for silks and finery, which they  persuade their husbands they bought for one-fourth of the price. And,  for my part, I am going to eat well, dress well, and enjoy myself as  long as ever I can get the money, by hook or by crook.\"      CHAPTER V.    THE PRETTY WAITER GIRL.    _Concert Saloons and how they are Managed--How the Pretty Waitresses  Live and upon Whom, and how the Unwary are Fleeced and Beguiled--A  Midnight Visit to one of the Dives._    Readers of the works of Le Sage will recall the polite devil which the  ingenious novelist releases from his captivity in a vial, for the  purpose of disclosing to the world the true inwardness of society in  Spain. Something of the role of this communicative imp we purpose to  enact in this chapter, the subject matter of which, we may safely  venture to assert, is new to at least nine-tenths of the residents of  this great city. And if people, to the manner born, are unacquainted  with the form and manifestations of this particular phase of crime, how  much more ignorant must be those casual visitors, who only, at long  intervals, are called by business, or impelled by anticipations of  pleasure, to visit the Empire City?    The mode of life of the merchant or business man does not bring him in  contact with crime or the haunts of criminals. He may pass down Sixth  avenue, or Third avenue and the Bowery, on the Elevated railroad; or  through Greene, Wooster, and Bleecker streets, the Bowery, Fourth  avenue, Forsythe, Canal, Thirty-fourth, Houston, Twenty-third and  Chatham streets, and other thoroughfares, in a street car, knowing  nothing about the inmates of the houses lining either side of those same  streets, or their manner of life, or anything about those inhabiting the  basement beneath. It is only when the startling head-lines in his  favorite morning paper call his attention to some frightful crime  committed, that he learns either of its character, or location, or the  causes which produced it. To this lack of knowledge on the part of the  respectable portion of the community of the location of questionable  places and the haunts of felons, is to be attributed many of the  robberies which, from time to time, are chronicled in the newspapers. In  the case of \"the stranger within our gates\" the danger of straying into  the sloughs of vice and consequent victimization, is of course greatly  increased. And just here it is worthy of remark that there appears to be  some mysterious fatality by which strangers, greenhorns and \"innocents,\"  generally, contrive to wander by unerring though devious ways, straight  into the talons of vigilant night-hawks.    Concert saloons and pretty waiter girls are treacherous things to meddle  with. Neither can be depended upon and generally both have unsavory  reputations. The only thing pretty about the girls is a pretty bad  record.    During the war for the Union, when enlistments for the army were lively,  and bounty jumpers flourished, and money was nearly as plentiful as  salt, concert saloon proprietors made enormous fortunes. They were then  a new sensation in this country; indeed, it may be said the war brought  them into being. Broadway, from Fourteenth street to the Battery was  literally lined on both sides with them, and when at night the lamps in  front of these places were lighted, it rendered the street almost as  bright as day. Then, as now, they were principally confined to the  basements or cellars of buildings, but while some of them were known to  be the rendezvous of thieves and other criminals, there were a few which  enjoyed a better reputation, and were frequented by people of  comparative respectability.    The pretty waiter girl, of course, was the principal magnet used to draw  customers to these saloons. She was and is to-day, in fact, the only  attraction. Music of a coarse description is used to attract the  passer-by, who, glancing at the place from whence it proceeds, sees  flaring lights, gaudy and brilliant signs--generally the figure of some  female in tights--and is allured in by the unusual appearance, and the  picture his imagination forms of a jolly time to be had within. Still,  the girl is the feature. It is a safe conclusion, that no waiter girl in  a concert saloon is virtuous, nor was there ever a really good girl  engaged in any such saloon. They are there to be bought by any one  fancying them, and therein lies the charm--if charm it can be called--of  these places. A stranger has nothing to do but walk down the steps,  enter the saloon, seat himself at a table, and he will immediately be  besieged by a crowd of girls--if that be what he is seeking. As the  stranger knows not the locality of other places of entertainment, he  accommodates himself to circumstances and takes what he sees before him.  Hence concert saloons thrive--but chiefly upon out-of-town  people--countrymen, in fact.    There are various causes which conspire to make pretty waiter girls.  They belong to three classes: First, the young girl who, but recently  fallen into sin, is placed there by \"her friend,\" which appellation more  frequently than otherwise stands for \"her seducer\"; second, the young  female who naturally seeks a position as waitress, because it pays her  best, the proprietors of some saloons paying a weekly salary, in others  a percentage upon the drinks sold; and third, an older kind of female  who, having run the gauntlet of nearly all forms of feminine  degradation, and losing most of the charms belonging to her sex, sees a  chance, upon the percentages allowed by the \"boss,\" and the overcharge  squeezed from frequenters, of making a living, with a prospect of once  in a while finding a man so drunk as not to have any choice in a  companion for the night. To this sort of individual, all females are  beautiful and the ancient and faded siren has as good a chance for  patronage as her younger and more favored rival. Hence the concert  saloon has its advantages for all kinds of women, as well as its uses  for all kinds of men. The price of drinks in these places varies  according to the tact of the pretty waiter girl, the sobriety of the  customer, or the \"rules of the house.\" In all cases, however, drinks are  higher than at ordinary bars, for the musicians have to be paid, the  girls to receive a percentage, as well as the proprietor to reap his  harvest. Besides, the smiles of lovely women must be reckoned at  something. In the Chatham street and Bowery dives, the worst and  cheapest of liquors and beers are dispensed to customers. In many of  these concert saloons \"private rooms\" have been arranged, where anyone  so disposed may choose his female companion and retire to quaff a bottle  of wine (?) at five dollars a bottle--a customer who indulges in such a  luxury as wine being too important and consequential to associate with  the common visitors. Money here as elsewhere has its worshipers."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],[0,"A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#9)"],[1,"architecture left  no good spaces where the pictures could be placed, and so the interior  painting of the churches was almost entirely confined to borders and  decorative patterns scattered here and there and used with great effect.  In Germany and England wall-painting was more used for the decoration of  castles, halls, chambers, and chapels; but as a whole mural painting was  of little importance at this time in comparison with its earlier days.    About A.D. 1350 panel pictures began to be more numerous, and from this  time there are vague accounts of schools of painting at Prague and  Cologne, and a few remnants exist which prove that such works were  executed in France and Flanders; but I shall pass over what is often  called the Transitional Period, by which we mean the time in which new  influences were beginning to act, and hereafter I will tell our story by  giving accounts of the lives of separate painters; for from about the  middle of the thirteenth century it is possible to trace the history of  painting through the study of individual artists.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--PORTRAIT OF CIMABUE.]    GIOVANNI CIMABUE, the first painter of whom I shall tell you, was born in  Florence in 1240. He is sometimes called the \"Father of Modern Painting,\"  because he was the first who restored that art to any degree of the  beauty to which it had attained before the Dark Ages. The Cimabui were a  noble family, and Giovanni was allowed to follow his own taste, and became  a painter; he was also skilled in mosaic work, and during the last years  of his life held the office of master of the mosaic workers in the  Cathedral of Pisa, where some of his own mosaics still remain.    Of his wall-paintings I shall say nothing except to tell you that the  finest are in the Upper Church at Assisi, where one sees the first step in  the development of the art of Tuscany. But I wish to tell the story of one  of his panel pictures, which is very interesting. It is now in the  Rucellai Chapel of the Church of Santa Maria Novella, in Florence, and it  is only just in me to say that if one of my readers walked through that  church and did not know about this picture, it is doubtful if he would  stop to look at it--certainly he would not admire it. The story is that  when Cimabue was about thirty years old he was busy in painting this  picture of the Madonna Enthroned, and he would not allow any one to see  what he was doing.    It happened, however, that Charles of Anjou, being on his way to Naples,  stopped in Florence, where the nobles did everything in their power for  his entertainment. Among other places they took him to the studio of  Cimabue, who uncovered his picture for the first time. Many persons then  flocked to see it, and were so loud in their joyful expressions of  admiration for it that the part of the city in which the studio was has  since been called the _Borgo Allegri_, or the \"joyous quarter.\"    When the picture was completed the day was celebrated as a festival; a  procession was formed; bands of music played joyful airs; the magistrates  of Florence honored the occasion with their presence; and the picture was  borne in triumph to the church. Cimabue must have been very happy at this  great appreciation of his art, and from that time he was famous in all  Italy.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--THE MADONNA OF THE CHURCH OF SANTA MARIA  NOVELLA.]    Another madonna by this master is in the Academy of Florence, and one  attributed to him is in the Louvre, in Paris.    Cimabue died about 1302, and was buried in the Church of Santa Maria del  Fiore, or the Cathedral of Florence. Above his tomb these words were  inscribed: \"Cimabue thought himself master of the field of painting. While  living, he was so. Now he holds his place among the stars of heaven.\"    Other artists who were important in this early time of the revival of  painting were ANDREA TAFI, a mosaist of Florence, MARGARITONE OF AREZZO,  GUIDO OF SIENA, and of the same city DUCCIO, the son of Buoninsegna. This  last painter flourished from 1282 to 1320; his altar-piece for the  Cathedral of Siena was also carried to its place in solemn procession,  with the sound of trumpet, drum, and bell.    GIOTTO DI BONDONE was the next artist in whom we have an unusual interest.  He was born at Del Colle, in the commune of Vespignano, probably about  1266, though the date is usually given ten years later. One of the best  reasons for calling Cimabue the \"Father of Painting\" is that he acted the  part of a father to Giotto, who proved to be so great an artist that from  his time painting made a rapid advance. The story is that one day when  Cimabue rode in the valley of Vespignano he saw a shepherd-boy who was  drawing a portrait of one of his sheep on a flat rock, by means of a  pointed bit of slate for a pencil. The sketch was so good that Cimabue  offered to take the boy to Florence, and teach him to paint. The boy's  father consented, and henceforth the little Giotto lived with Cimabue, who  instructed him in painting, and put him to study letters under Brunetto  Latini, who was also the teacher of the great poet, Dante.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--PORTRAIT OF DANTE, PAINTED BY GIOTTO.]    The picture which we give here is from the earliest work by Giotto of  which we have any knowledge. In it were the portraits of Dante, Latini,  and several others. This picture was painted on a wall of the Podesta at  Florence, and when Dante was exiled from that city his portrait was  covered with whitewash; in 1841 it was restored to the light, having been  hidden for centuries. It is a precious memento of the friendship between  the great artist and the divine poet, who expressed his admiration of  Giotto in these lines:--          \"In painting Cimabue fain had thought           To lord the field; now Giotto has the cry,         So that the other's fame in shade is brought.\"    Giotto did much work in Florence; he also, about 1300, executed frescoes  in the Lower Church at Assisi; from 1303-1306 he painted his beautiful  pictures in the Cappella dell' Arena, at Padua, by which the genius of  Giotto is now most fully shown. He worked at Rimini also, and about 1330  was employed by King Robert of Naples, who conferred many honors upon him,  and made him a member of his own household. In 1334 Giotto was made the  chief master of the cathedral works in Florence, as well as of the city  fortifications and all architectural undertakings by the city authorities.  He held this high position but three years, as he died on January 8, 1337.    Giotto was also a great architect, as is well known from his tower in  Florence, for which he made all the designs and a part of the working  models, while some of the sculptures and reliefs upon it prove that he was  skilled in modelling and carving. He worked in mosaics also, and the  famous \"Navicella,\" in the vestibule of St. Peter's at Rome, was  originally made by him, but has now been so much restored that it is  doubtful if any part of what remains was done by Giotto's hands.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--GIOTTO'S CAMPANILE AND THE DUOMO. _Florence._]    The works of Giotto are too numerous to be mentioned here, and his  merits as an artist too important to be discussed in our limits; but his  advance in painting was so great that he deserved the great compliment of  Cennino, who said that Giotto \"had done or translated the art of painting  from Greek into Latin.\"    I shall, however, tell you of one excellent thing that he did, which was  to make the representation of the crucifix far more refined and  Christ-like than it had ever been. Before his time every effort had been  made to picture physical agony alone. Giotto gave a gentle face, full of  suffering, it is true, but also expressive of tenderness and resignation,  and it would not be easy to paint a better crucifix than those of this  master.    In person Giotto was so ugly that his admirers made jokes about it; but he  was witty and attractive in conversation, and so modest that his friends  were always glad to praise him while he lived, and since his death his  fame has been cherished by all who have written of him. There are many  anecdotes told of Giotto. One is that on a very hot day in Naples, King  Robert said to the painter, \"Giotto, if I were you, I would leave work,  and rest.\" Giotto quickly replied, \"So would I, sire, _if I were you_.\"    When the same king asked him to paint a picture which would represent his  kingdom, Giotto drew an ass bearing a saddle on which were a crown and  sceptre, while at the feet of the ass there was a new saddle with a  shining new crown and sceptre, at which the ass was eagerly smelling. By  this he intended to show that the Neapolitans were so fickle that they  were always looking for a new king.    There is a story which has been often repeated which says, that in order  to paint his crucifixes so well, he persuaded a man to be bound to a cross  for an hour as a model; and when he had him there he stabbed him, in order  to see such agony as he wished to paint. When the Pope saw the picture he  was so pleased with it that he wished to have it for his own chapel; then  Giotto confessed what he had done, and showed the body of the dead man.  The Pope was so angry that he threatened the painter with the same death,  upon which Giotto brushed the picture over so that it seemed to be  destroyed. Then the Pope so regretted the loss of the crucifix that he  promised to pardon Giotto if he would paint him another as good. Giotto  exacted the promise in writing, and then, with a wet sponge, removed the  wash he had used, and the picture was as good as before. According to  tradition all famous crucifixes were drawn from this picture ever after.    When Boniface VIII. sent a messenger to invite Giotto to Rome, the  messenger asked Giotto to show him something of the art which had made him  so famous. Giotto, with a pencil, by a single"]]]
