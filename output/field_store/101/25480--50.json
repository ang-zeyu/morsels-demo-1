[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2785"],[0,"The Elusive Pimpernel (#9)"],[1,"to me,\"  said Marguerite, this time with unaffected cordiality. \"I must have  applauded you many a time in the olden days. I am an ex-colleague, you  know. My name was St. Just before I married, and I was of the Maison  Moliere.\"    \"I knew that,\" said Desiree Candeille, \"and half hoped that you would  remember me.\"    \"Nay! who could forget Demoiselle Candeille, the most popular star in  the theatrical firmament?\"    \"Oh! that was so long ago.\"    \"Only four years.\"    \"A fallen star is soon lost out of sight.\"    \"Why fallen?\"    \"It was a choice for me between exile from France and the guillotine,\"  rejoined Candeille simply.    \"Surely not?\" queried Marguerite with a touch of genuine sympathy.  With characteristic impulsiveness, she had now cast aside her former  misgivings: she had conquered her mistrust, at any rate had relegated  it to the background of her mind. This woman was a colleague: she had  suffered and was in distress; she had every claim, therefore, on a  compatriot's help and friendship. She stretched out her hand and took  Desiree Candeille's in her own; she forced herself to feel nothing but  admiration for this young woman, whose whole attitude spoke of sorrows  nobly borne, of misfortunes proudly endured.    \"I don't know why I should sadden you with my story,\" rejoined Desiree  Candeille after a slight pause, during which she seemed to be waging  war against her own emotion. \"It is not a very interesting one. Hundreds  have suffered as I did. I had enemies in Paris. God knows how that  happened. I had never harmed anyone, but someone must have hated me and  must have wished me ill. Evil is so easily wrought in France these days.  A denunciation--a perquisition--an accusation--then the flight from  Paris... the forged passports... the disguise... the bribe... the  hardships... the squalid hiding places.... Oh! I have gone through  it all... tasted every kind of humiliation... endured every kind of  insult.... Remember! that I was not a noble aristocrat... a Duchess  or an impoverished Countess...\" she added with marked bitterness, \"or  perhaps the English cavaliers whom the popular voice has called the  League of the Scarlet Pimpernel would have taken some interest in me. I  was only a poor actress and had to find my way out of France alone, or  else perish on the guillotine.\"    \"I am so sorry!\" said Marguerite simply.    \"Tell me how you got on, once you were in England,\" she continued after  a while, seeing that Desiree Candeille seemed absorbed in thought.    \"I had a few engagements at first,\" replied the Frenchwoman. \"I played  at Sadler's Wells and with Mrs. Jordan at Covent Garden, but the Aliens'  Bill put an end to my chances of livelihood. No manager cared to give me  a part, and so...\"    \"And so?\"    \"Oh! I had a few jewels and I sold them.... A little money and I live on  that.... But when I played at Covent Garden I contrived to send part of  my salary over to some of the poorer clubs of Paris. My heart aches for  those that are starving.... Poor wretches, they are misguided and misled  by self-seeking demagogues.... It hurts me to feel that I can do nothing  more to help them... and eases my self-respect if, by singing at public  fairs, I can still send a few francs to those who are poorer than  myself.\"    She had spoken with ever-increasing passion and vehemence. Marguerite,  with eyes fixed into vacancy, seeing neither the speaker nor her  surroundings, seeing only visions of those same poor wreckages of  humanity, who had been goaded into thirst for blood, when their shrunken  bodies should have been clamouring for healthy food,--Marguerite  thus absorbed, had totally forgotten her earlier prejudices and now  completely failed to note all that was unreal, stagy, theatrical, in the  oratorical declamations of the ex-actress from the Varietes.    Pre-eminently true and loyal herself in spite of the many deceptions and  treacheries which she had witnessed in her life, she never looked for  falsehood or for cant in others. Even now she only saw before her a  woman who had been wrongfully persecuted, who had suffered and had  forgiven those who had caused her to suffer. She bitterly accused  herself for her original mistrust of this noble-hearted, unselfish  woman, who was content to tramp around in an alien country, bartering  her talents for a few coins, in order that some of those, who were the  originators of her sorrows, might have bread to eat and a bed in which  to sleep.    \"Mademoiselle,\" she said warmly, \"truly you shame me, who am also  French-born, with the many sacrifices you so nobly make for those who  should have first claim on my own sympathy. Believe me, if I have  not done as much as duty demanded of me in the cause of my starving  compatriots, it has not been for lack of good-will. Is there any way  now,\" she added eagerly, \"in which I can help you? Putting aside the  question of money, wherein I pray you to command my assistance, what can  I do to be of useful service to you?\"    \"You are very kind, Lady Blakeney...\" said the other hesitatingly.    \"Well? What is it? I see there is something in your mind...\"    \"It is perhaps difficult to express... but people say I have a good  voice... I sing some French ditties... they are a novelty in England, I  think.... If I could sing them in fashionable salons... I might  perhaps...\"    \"Nay! you shall sing in fashionable salons,\" exclaimed Marguerite  eagerly, \"you shall become the fashion, and I'll swear the Prince of  Wales himself shall bid you sing at Carlton House... and you shall name  your own fee, Mademoiselle... and London society shall vie with the  elite of Bath, as to which shall lure you to its most frequented  routs.... There! there! you shall make a fortune for the Paris poor...  and to prove to you that I mean every word I say, you shall begin your  triumphant career in my own salon to-morrow night. His Royal Highness  will be present. You shall sing your most engaging songs... and for  your fee you must accept a hundred guineas, which you shall send to  the poorest workman's club in Paris in the name of Sir Percy and Lady  Blakeney.\"    \"I thank your ladyship, but...\"    \"You'll not refuse?\"    \"I'll accept gladly... but... you will understand... I am not very old,\"  said Candeille quaintly, \"I... I am only an actress... but if a young  actress is unprotected... then...\"    \"I understand,\" replied Marguerite gently, \"that you are far too pretty  to frequent the world all alone, and that you have a mother, a sister  or a friend... which?... whom you would wish to escort you to-morrow. Is  that it?\"    \"Nay,\" rejoined the actress, with marked bitterness, \"I have neither  mother, nor sister, but our Revolutionary Government, with tardy  compassion for those it has so relentlessly driven out of France,  has deputed a representative of theirs in England to look after the  interests of French subjects over here!\"    \"Yes?\"    \"They have realised over in Paris that my life here has been devoted to  the welfare of the poor people of France. The representative whom the  government has sent to England is specially interested in me and in  my work. He is a stand-by for me in case of trouble... in case of  insults... A woman alone is oft subject to those, even at the hands of  so-called gentlemen... and the official representative of my own country  becomes in such cases my most natural protector.\"    \"I understand.\"    \"You will receive him?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Then may I present him to your ladyship?\"    \"Whenever you like.\"    \"Now, and it please you.\"    \"Now?\"    \"Yes. Here he comes, at your ladyship's service.\"    Desiree Candeille's almond-shaped eyes were fixed upon a distant part of  the tent, behind Lady Blakeney in the direction of the main entrance  to the booth. There was a slight pause after she had spoken and  then Marguerite slowly turned in order to see who this official  representative of France was, whom at the young actress' request she had  just agreed to receive in her house. In the doorway of the tent, framed  by its gaudy draperies, and with the streaming sunshine as a brilliant  background behind him, stood the sable-clad figure of Chauvelin.          Chapter VII: Premonition        Marguerite neither moved nor spoke. She felt two pairs of eyes fixed  upon her, and with all the strength of will at her command she forced  the very blood in her veins not to quit her cheeks, forced her eyelids  not to betray by a single quiver the icy pang of a deadly premonition  which at sight of Chauvelin seemed to have chilled her entire soul.    There he stood before her, dressed in his usual somber garments, a look  almost of humility in those keen grey eyes of his, which a year ago on  the cliffs of Calais had peered down at her with such relentless hate.    Strange that at this moment she should have felt an instinct of fear.  What cause had she to throw more than a pitiful glance at the man who  had tried so cruelly to wrong her, and who had so signally failed?    Having bowed very low and very respectfully, Chauvelin advanced towards  her, with all the airs of a disgraced courtier craving audience from his  queen.    As he approached she instinctively drew back.    \"Would you prefer not to speak to me, Lady Blakeney?\" he said humbly.    She could scarcely believe her ears, or trust her eyes. It seemed  impossible that a man could have so changed in a few months. He even  looked shorter than last year, more shrunken within himself. His hair,  which he wore free from powder, was perceptibly tinged with grey.    \"Shall I withdraw?\" he added after a pause, seeing that Marguerite made  no movement to return his salutation.    \"It would be best, perhaps,\" she replied coldly. \"You and I, Monsieur  Chauvelin, have so little to say to one another.\"    \"Very little indeed,\" he rejoined quietly; \"the triumphant and happy  have ever very little to say to the humiliated and the defeated.

The steamship Cambria arrived at Boston on Friday, the 18th inst.,  thirteen days from Liverpool. From the news by this arrival, we select  the following brief items:--not very interesting, but better than  none.           *       *       *       *       *      The man Henry, who lately attempted to shoot the King of France, has  been tried and condemned to work in the galleys for life.--During his  trial, he expressed a wish to be condemned to death, but the request  was not granted.           *       *       *       *       *      The Bank of England has reduced its rate of interest to 3 per cent.,  whereby greater facilities are given to trade to counteract the  depression likely to proceed from other causes.           *       *       *       *       *      The British ship America recently arrived from the coast of Mexico and  Peru, liberally laden with specie, the amount whereof is stated at  _six millions of dollars_, which, in silver, would make nearly two  hundred and fifty tons.           *       *       *       *       *      The Queen of Spain, Isabella, has decided to marry her cousin, the  Duke de Cadiz; thus putting to rest a subject which has long agitated  the circles of royalty in Europe.           *       *       *       *       *      Late news from the east furnishes the report that robberies and  piracies are of hourly occurrence in the immediate vicinity of Hong  Kong.

The latest news from Mexico, and from our army, represent affairs in a  most quaint and ludicrous light, with regard to the policy and  movements of all parties. The average progress of the army of invasion  appears to be about three miles a day, with no opposition, nor  prospect of any; while the Mexicans are tame as bullfrogs, showing no  disposition to either fight or run. Gen. Parades having got sick of  his job, has suffered himself to be imprisoned at the approach of  Santa Anna, who has returned and resumed the government without  opposition. Mr. Polk having sent an embassy, virtually asking  permission to \"give it up,\" has been refused a hearing, unless he will  first withdraw our troops from the Mexican territory; while the  Mexican army appointed to combat and conquer Gen. Taylor, remains at  ease and content at Mexico, calculating, probably, that the longer  they wait, the less distance they will have to travel to encounter the  Yankees. Whether our President will call off Gen. Taylor with the  American troops, before they reach anywhere in particular, remains to  be decided.           *       *       *       *       *          TRADE TO SANTA FE.

The value of the goods carried  out by these traders, is estimated at nearly a million of dollars.           *       *       *       *       *      A large mastiff dog picked up a favorite lap dog in the upper part of  the city last week, and ran off with it.

The harbor  itself is an oblong basin, surrounded by heights which usually shelter  it from the wind.    Havana is a place of considerable strength, and, besides the walls and  ditches which surround it, the city is defended by six strongholds,  called the Moro, the Cobanas, No. 4, the Atares, the Principie and the  Putna. The first and last serve to protect the entrance of the harbor,  the second is a sort of citadel and the others are so placed as to  cover the approaches by land. The line of fortification, embraces a  sort of irregular polygon of an eliptical form, the greatest diameter  of which is 2,100 yards, and the smallest 1,200 yards in extent. The  entrance between the Moro and Putna, castles is about 1,500 yards  long, and in its narrowest part 350 yards wide. In the arsenal of the  Havana, there have been built 49 ships of the line, 22 frigates, 7  packet ships, 9 brigs of war, and 15 schooners of war.    The town is built on the western side of the basin, near the channel,  on a kind of promontory. The suburbs, or _barrios esta muros_, cover  more ground and contain a larger population than the city itself, and  yet they are so intimately connected with it, that the first of the  houses in the suburban street, stands on the very edge of the  _glacis_.    The streets are narrow, crooked, and generally unpaved, but they  contain some well-built houses. There are, too, several good buildings  among the churches, one of which contains the remains of Christopher  Columbus. The other large edifices, as the Palace of the Government  (shown to the right of the engraving,) that of the commandant of the  marine, the arsenal, the post-office, and the building used for the  manufacture of tobacco, are less remarkable for their architecture  than for their solidity. Besides these, the city contains nine parish  churches; six other churches, connected with hospitals and military  orders; five chapels or hermitages; the Caza Cuna, a foundling  hospital; and eleven convents, four for women, and seven for men. The  other public establishments are the University, the colleges of San  Carlos and San Francisco de Soles, the Botanic Garden, the Anatomical  Museum and lecture rooms, the Academy of Painting and Design, a school  of Navigation, and seventy-eight common schools for both sexes. These  places of education are all under the protection of the Patriotic  Society and the municipal authorities. The charitable institutions  consist of the _Caza de Beneficiencia_, for both sexes, a  penitentiary, a Magdalen Asylum, and seven hospitals--one of them  contains a lunatic asylum. There are, besides, three theatres, an  amphitheatre for bull fights, _plaza de toros_, and several public  promenades, such as the Alameda and the Paseo Nuevo; In Turnbull's  \"Travels in Cuba,\" published by Longman & Co., London, 1840, the city  is said to contain 3,671 houses within the walls, all built of stone;  and in the suburbs, 7,968, of various materials. The number of private  carriages for hire amounted, in 1827, to 2,651, and they are certainly  now more numerous. In the same year, the population was 122,023--the  whites were 46,621; the free negroes, 15,347; the free mulattoes,  8,215; the negro slaves, 22,830, and the mulatto slaves 1,010.    Turnbull, speaking of the _Real Caza de Beneficencia_, says: \"Girls  are not admitted to the institution after 10 years of age; and, being  entirely supported there, they are completely separated from their  parents and their families, until the time of their final removal from  the establishment has arrived. They are taught the various branches of  needle-work and dress-making, and receive such other instruction as  may sufficiently qualify them for becoming domestic servants,  housemaids, cooks or washerwomen. They are not suffered, by the  regulations, to remain in the house after the age of twenty-one: but,  before that time, it is the duty of the _junta_, or committee of  management, to endeavor to procure employment for them earlier in a  private family or in some house of business. Should the circumstances  of the parents have improved during the stay of their daughter at the  institution, they are not suffered to take her away until they have  paid her previous board and education at the rate "]]]
