In the first act the anchors are passive, but they begin  to take an active share in the forward movement when the body is  contracted again. Frequently the animal retains only the posterior end  buried in the sand, and then the anchors keep it in position, and make  rapid withdrawal possible.    Thus we have in these apparently random forms of the calcereous  bodies, complex adaptations in which every little detail as to  direction, curve, and pointing is exactly determined. That they have  selection-value in their present perfected form is beyond all doubt,  since the animals are enabled by means of them to bore rapidly into  the ground and so to escape from enemies. We do not know what the  initial stages were, but we cannot doubt that the little improvements,  which occurred as variations of the originally simple slimy bodies of  the Holothurians, were preserved because they already possessed  selection-value for the Synaptidae. For such minute microscopic  structures whose form is so delicately adapted to the role they have  to play in the life of the animal, cannot have arisen suddenly and as  a whole, and every new variation of the anchor, that is, in the  direction of the development of the two arms, and every curving of the  shaft which prevented the tips from projecting at the wrong time, in  short, every little adaptation in the modelling of the anchor must  have possessed selection-value. And that such minute changes of form  fall within the sphere of fluctuating variations, that is to say,  _that they occur_ is beyond all doubt.    In many of the Synaptidae the anchors are replaced by calcareous rods  bent in the form of an S, which are said to act in the same way.  Others, such as those of the genus Ankyroderma, have anchors which  project considerably beyond the skin, and, according to Oestergren,  serve \"to catch plant-particles and other substances\" and so mask the  animal. Thus we see that in the Synaptidae the thick and irregular  calcareous bodies of the Holothurians have been modified and  transformed in various ways in adaptation to the footlessness of these  animals, and to the peculiar conditions of their life, and we must  conclude that the earlier stages of these changes presented themselves  to the processes of selection in the form of microscopic variations.  For it is as impossible to think of any origin other than through  selection in this case as in the case of the toughness, and the  \"drip-tips\" of tropical leaves. And as these last could not have been  produced directly by the beating of the heavy raindrops upon them, so  the calcareous anchors of Synapta cannot have been produced directly  by the friction of the sand and mud at the bottom of the sea, and,  since they are parts whose function is _passive_ the Lamarckian factor  of use and disuse does not come into question. The conclusion is  unavoidable, that the microscopically small variations of the  calcareous bodies in the ancestral forms have been intensified and  accumulated in a particular direction, till they have led to the  formation of the anchor. Whether this has taken place by the action of  natural selection alone, or whether the laws of variation and the  intimate processes within the germ-plasm have cooeperated will become  clear in the discussion of germinal selection. This whole process of  adaptation has obviously taken place within the time that has elapsed  since this group of sea-cucumbers lost their tube-feet, those  characteristic organs of locomotion which occur in no group except the  Echinoderms, and yet have totally disappeared in the Synaptidae. And  after all what would animals that live in sand and mud do with  tube-feet?      (_c_) _Coadaptation_    Darwin pointed out that one of the essential differences between  artificial and natural selection lies in the fact that the former can  modify only a few characters, usually only one at a time, while Nature  preserves in the struggle for existence all the variations of a  species, at the same time and in a purely mechanical way, if they  possess selection-value.    Herbert Spencer, though himself an adherent of the theory of selection,  declared in the beginning of the nineties that in his opinion the range of  this principle was greatly over-estimated, if the great changes which have  taken place in so many organisms in the course of ages are to be  interpreted as due to this process of selection alone, since no  transformation of any importance can be evolved by itself; it is always  accompanied by a host of secondary changes. He gives the familiar example  of the Giant Stag of the Irish peat, the enormous antlers of which required  not only a much stronger skull cap, but also greater strength of the  sinews, muscles, nerves and bones of the whole anterior half of the animal,  if their mass was not to weigh down the animal altogether. It is  inconceivable, he says, that so many processes of selection should take  place _simultaneously_, and we are therefore forced to fall back on the  Lamarckian factor of the use and disuse of functional parts. And how, he  asks, could natural selection follow two opposite directions of evolution  in different parts of the body at the same time, as for instance in the  case of the kangaroo, in which the forelegs must have become shorter, while  the hind legs and the tail were becoming longer and stronger?    Spencer's main object was to substantiate the validity of the  Lamarckian principle, the cooeperation of which with selection had been  doubted by many. And it does seem as though this principle, if it  operates in nature at all, offers a ready and simple explanation of  all such secondary variations. Not only muscles, but nerves, bones,  sinews, in short all tissues which function actively, increase in  strength in proportion as they are used, and conversely they decrease  when the claims on them diminish. All the parts, therefore, which  depend on the part that varied first, as for instance the enlarged  antlers of the Irish Elk, must have been increased or decreased in  strength, in exact proportion to the claims made upon them,--just as  is actually the case.    But beautiful as this explanation would be, I regard it as untenable,  because it assumes the _transmissibility of functional modifications_  (so-called \"acquired\" characters), and this is not only  undemonstrable, but is scarcely theoretically conceivable, for the  secondary variations which accompany or follow the first as  correlative variations, occur also in cases in which the animals  concerned are sterile and _therefore cannot transmit anything to their  descendants_. This is true of _worker bees_, and particularly of  _ants_, and I shall here give a brief survey of the present state of  the problem as it appears to me.    Much has been written on both sides of this question since the  published controversy on the subject in the nineties between Herbert  Spencer and myself. I should like to return to the matter in detail,  if the space at my disposal permitted, because it seems to me that the  arguments I advanced at that time are equally cogent to-day,  notwithstanding all the objections that have since been urged against  them. Moreover, the matter is by no means one of subordinate interest;  it is the very kernel of the whole question of the reality and value  of the principle of selection. For if selection alone does not suffice  to explain \"_harmonious adaptation_\" as I have called Spencer's  _Coadaptation_, and if we require to call in the aid of the Lamarckian  factor it would be questionable whether selection would explain any  adaptations whatever. In this particular case--of worker bees--the  Lamarckian factor may be excluded altogether, for it can be  demonstrated that here at any rate the effects of use and disuse  cannot be transmitted.    But if it be asked why we are unwilling to admit the cooeperation of  the Darwinian factor of selection and the Lamarckian factor, since  this would afford us an easy and satisfactory explanation of the  phenomena, I answer: _Because the Lamarckian principle is fallacious,  and because by accepting it we close the way towards deeper insight_.  It is not a spirit of combativeness or a desire for self-vindication  that induces me to take the field once more against the Lamarckian  principle, it is the conviction that the progress of our knowledge is  being obstructed by the acceptance of this fallacious principle, since  the facile explanation it apparently affords prevents our seeking  after a truer explanation and a deeper analysis.    The workers in the various species of ants are sterile, that is to  say, they take no regular part in the reproduction of the species,  although individuals among them may occasionally lay eggs. In addition  to this they have lost the wings, and the _receptaculum seminis_, and  their compound eyes have degenerated to a few facets. How could this  last change have come about through disuse, since the eyes of workers  are exposed to light in the same way as are those of the sexual  insects and thus in this particular case are not liable to \"disuse\" at  all? The same is true of the _receptaculum seminis_, which can only  have been disused as far as its glandular portion and its stalk are  concerned, and also of the wings, the nerves tracheae and epidermal  cells of which could not cease to function until the whole wing had  degenerated, for the chitinous skeleton of the wing does not function  at all in the active sense.    But, on the other hand, the workers in all species have undergone  modifications in a positive direction, as, for instance, the greater  development of brain. In many species large workers have evolved,--the  so-called _soldiers_, with enormous jaws and teeth, which defend the  colony,--and in others there are _small_ workers which have taken over  other special functions, such as the rearing of the young Aphides.

In Memoriam:    REGINALD WARNEFORD    [From Truth of London]          Young gallant soul, unversed in fear,        Who swiftly flew aloft to fame,        And made yourself a world-wide name,      Ere scarce had dawned your brief career.        To glory some but slowly climb        By painful inches of ascent,        And some, hereon though sternly bent,      Ne'er reach it all their life's long time.        But you--you soared as eagles soar;        At one strong flight you flashed on high;        The sudden chance came sudden nigh;      You seized it; off its spoils you bore.        And now, while still the welkin rings        With your unmatched heroic deed,        To paean elegies succeed,      The mournful Muse your requiem sings.        A requiem, yet with triumph rife!        How not, while men their souls would give        To die your death, so they might live      Your \"crowded hour of glorious life\"?        Great hour, that knows not time nor tide,        Wild hour, that drinks an age's sweets,        Brave hour, that throbs with breathless feats,      Short hour, whose splendours long abide.          American Preparedness    By Theodore Roosevelt      _In an address at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco,  delivered on July 21, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt said:_    I have a very strong feeling about the Panama Exposition. It was my  good fortune to take the action in 1903, failure to take which, in  exactly the shape I took it, would have meant that no Panama Canal  would have been built for half a century, and, therefore, that there  would have been no exposition to celebrate the building of the canal.  In everything we did in connection with the acquiring of the Panama  Zone we acted in a way to do absolute justice to all other nations, to  benefit all other nations, including especially the adjacent States,  and to render the utmost service, from the standpoint alike of honor  and of material interest, to the United States. I am glad that this is  the case, for if there were the slightest taint upon our title or our  conduct it would have been an improper and shameful thing to hold this  exposition.    The building of the canal nearly doubles the potential efficiency of  the United States Navy, as long as it is fortified and is in our  hands; but if left unfortified it would at once become a menace to us.    What is true as to our proper attitude in regard to the canal is no  less true as regards our proper attitude concerning the interests of  the United States taken as a whole. The canal is to be a great agency  for peace; it can be such only, and exactly in proportion as it  increased our potential efficiency in war.    Those men who like myself believe that the highest duty of this nation  is to prepare itself against war so that it may safely trust its honor  and interest to its own strength are advocating merely that we do as a  nation regarding our general interests what we have already done in  Panama. If, instead of acting as this nation did in the Fall of 1903,  we had confined ourselves to debates in Congress and diplomatic notes;  if, in other words, we had treated elocution as a substitute for  action, we would have done nobody any good, and for ourselves we would  have earned the hearty derision of all other nations--the canal would  not even have been begun at the present day, and there would have been  a general consensus of international opinion to the effect that we  were totally unfit to perform any of the duties of international life,  especially in connection with the Western hemisphere.    Unfortunately in the last few years we have as regards pretty much  everything not connected with the Isthmus of Panama so failed in our  duty of national preparedness that I fear there actually is a general  consensus of opinion to precisely this effect among the nations of the  world as regards the United States at the present day. This is  primarily due to our unpreparedness.    We have been culpably, well-nigh criminally, remiss as a nation in not  preparing ourselves, and if, with the lessons taught the world by the  dreadful tragedies of the last twelve months, we continue with soft  complacency to stand helpless and naked before the world, we shall  excite only contempt and derision if and when disaster ultimately  overwhelms us.    Preparedness against war does not invariably avert war any more than a  fire department in a city will invariably avert a fire; and there are  well-meaning foolish people who point out this fact as offering an  excuse for unpreparedness. It would be just as sensible if after the  Chicago fire Chicago had announced that it would abolish its fire  department as for our people to take the same view as regards  military preparedness. Some years ago I was looking over some very old  newspapers contemporaneous with the early establishment of paid fire  departments in this country, and to my amusement I came across a  letter which argued against a paid fire department upon the ground  that the knowledge of its existence would tend to make householders  careless, and therefore would encourage fires.    Greece was not prepared for war when she went to war with Turkey a  score of years ago. But this fact did not stop the war. It merely made  the war unsuccessful for Greece. China was not prepared for war with  Japan twenty-odd years ago, nor for war with the Allies who marched to  Peking fifteen years ago.    _Colonel Roosevelt then discussed in detail the cases of China and  Belgium, comparing Belgium with Switzerland, and asserting that  Switzerland would have met Belgium's fate if she had not been prepared  to oppose invasion. Then taking up the case of China, he said:_    She has acted on the theory that the worst peace was better than the  best war, and therefore she has suffered all the evils of the worst  war and the worst peace. The average Chinaman took the view that China  was too proud to fight and in practice made evident his hearty  approval of the sentiments of that abject pacifist song: \"I Didn't  Raise My Boy to be a Soldier,\" a song which should have as a companion  piece one entitled: \"I Didn't Raise my Girl to be a Mother,\" approval  of which of course deprives any men or women of all right of kinship  with the soldiers and with the mothers and wives of the soldiers,  whose valor and services we commemorate on the Fourth of July and on  Decoration Day; a song, the singing of which seems incredible to every  man and woman capable of being stirred to lofty and generous  enthusiasm by the tremendous surge of Julia Ward Howe's \"Battle Hymn  of the Republic.\" China has steadily refused to prepare for war.  Accordingly China has had province after province lopped off her,  until one-half of her territory is now under Japanese, Russian,  English and French control.    The professional pacifists, the peace-at-any-price, non-resistance,  universal arbitration people are now seeking to Chinafy this country.    During the past year or so this nation has negotiated some thirty  all-inclusive peace treaties by which it is agreed that if any issue  arises, no matter of what kind, between itself and any other nation,  it would take no final steps about it until a commission of  investigation had discussed the matter for a year. This was an  explicit promise in each case that if American women were raped and  American men murdered, as has actually occurred in Mexico; or American  men, women, and children drowned on the high seas, as in the case of  the Gulflight and Lusitania; or if a foreign power secured and  fortified Magdalena Bay or the Island of St. Thomas, we would appoint  a commission and listen to a year's conversation on the subject before  taking action.    England and France entered into these treaties with us, and we begged  Germany to enter into one, and, although Germany refused, yet if we  were right in entering into them with England and France, we deprived  ourselves of moral justification in refusing to fulfill their spirit  as regards Germany. Personally I believe that it was absolutely  necessary when the concrete case arose to repudiate the principle to  which we had thus committed ourselves. But it was a shameful thing to  have put ourselves in such a position that it had to be repudiated,  and it was inexcusable of us to decline to follow the principle in the  case of the Lusitania without at the same time making frank confession  of our error and misconduct by notifying all the powers with whom we  had already made the treaties that they were withdrawn, because in  practice we had found it impossible and improper to follow out the  principle to which they committed us.          First Year of the War    Military Resumes of Operations on All Fronts--August, 1914 to August,  1915    By Lieutenant Walter E. Ives    _Formerly of the Royal Prussian Thirteenth Dragoons_    _and_    By An American Military Expert      One Year's War    By LIEUTENANT WALTER E. IVES    I.    THE WESTERN CAMPAIGN    The first year of the European war has drawn to a close. A resume  covering the military events it has produced brings to view two  distinct phases of the campaign. The first phase comprises the period  from Aug. 3 to Oct. 27, and consists of a tenacious effort to carry  through the original plan of war of the German General Staff: to  strike a crushing blow at France, and after putting her \"hors de  combat,\" to turn on the enemy in the East. The second phase comprises  the time from Oct. 27 to the present, and consists in the pursuance of  military aims forming the direct reversal of the original ones.    The campaign against France, in consequence of the German plan of  strategy the first one to come into prominence, can, in its first  phase, be divided into four periods.    The first period comprises the operations in Belgium, German Lorraine  and Alsace, from Aug. 3 to Aug. 23, the day before the Battle for"]]]
