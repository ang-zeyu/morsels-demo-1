Here we have  the three sisters, the two elder jealous and spiteful, the youngest  beautiful and gentle and quite unable to defend herself against her  sisters' wicked arts. Here, too, is the mysterious bridegroom who is  never seen and who is lost to his bride because of her lack of faith.  Truly it is an old, old tale--older than all fairy tales--the story of  love that is not strong enough to believe and to wait, and so to \"win  through\" in the end--the story of seeds of suspicion sown by one full  of malice in an innocent heart, and which bring to the hapless reaper  a cruel harvest.    Once upon a time, so goes the tale, a king and queen had three  beautiful daughters. The first and the second were fair indeed, but  the beauty of the youngest was such that all the people of the land  worshipped it as a thing sent straight from Olympus. They awaited her  outside the royal palace, and when she came, they threw chaplets of  roses and violets for her little feet to tread upon, and sang hymns of  praise as though she were no mortal maiden but a daughter of the  deathless gods.    There were many who said that the beauty of Aphrodite herself was less  perfect than the beauty of Psyche, and when the goddess found that men  were forsaking her altars in order to worship a mortal maiden, great  was her wrath against them and against the princess who, all  unwittingly, had wrought her this shameful harm.    In her garden, sitting amongst the flowers and idly watching his  mother's fair white doves as they preened their snowy feathers in the  sun, Aphrodite found her son Eros, and angrily poured forth to him the  story of her shame.    \"Thine must be the task of avenging thy mother's honour,\" she said.  \"Thou who hast the power of making the loves of men, stab with one of  thine arrows the heart of this presumptuous maiden, and shame her  before all other mortals by making her love a monster from which all  others shrink and which all despise.\" With wicked glee Eros heard his  mother's commands. His beautiful face, still the face of a mischievous  boy, lit up with merriment. This was, in truth, a game after his own  heart. In the garden of Aphrodite is a fountain of sweet, another of  bitter water, and Eros filled two amber vases, one from each fountain,  hung them from his quiver, and        \"Straight he rose from earth and down the wind      Went glittering 'twixt the blue sky and the sea.\"    In her chamber Psyche lay fast asleep, and swiftly, almost without a  glance at her, Eros sprinkled some of the bitter drops upon her lips,  and then, with one of his sharpest arrows, pricked her snowy breast.  Like a child who half awakes in fear, and looks up with puzzled,  wondering eyes, Psyche, with a little moan, opened eyes that were  bluer than the violets in spring and gazed at Eros. He knew that he  was invisible, and yet her gaze made him tremble.    \"They spoke truth!\" said the lad to himself. \"Not even my mother is as  fair as this princess.\"    For a moment her eyelids quivered, and then dropped. Her long dark  lashes fell on her cheeks that were pink as the hearts of the fragile  shells that the waves toss up on western beaches, her red mouth,  curved like the bow of Eros, smiled happily, and Psyche slept again.  With heart that beat as it had never beaten before, Eros gazed upon  her perfect loveliness. With gentle, pitying finger he wiped away the  red drop where his arrow had wounded her, and then stooped and touched  her lips with his own, so lightly that Psyche in her dreams thought  that they had been brushed by a butterfly's wings. Yet in her sleep  she moved, and Eros, starting back, pricked himself with one of his  arrows. And with that prick, for Eros there passed away all the  careless ease of the heart of a boy, and he knew that he loved Psyche  with the unquenchable love of a deathless god. Now, with bitter  regret, all his desire was to undo the wrong he had done to the one  that he loved. Speedily he sprinkled her with the sweet water that  brings joy, and when Psyche rose from her couch she was radiant with  the beauty that comes from a new, undreamed-of happiness.        \"From place to place Love followed her that day      And ever fairer to his eyes she grew,      So that at last when from her bower he flew,      And underneath his feet the moonlit sea      Went shepherding his waves disorderly,      He swore that of all gods and men, no one      Should hold her in his arms but he alone;      That she should dwell with him in glorious wise      Like to a goddess in some paradise;      Yea, he would get from Father Jove this grace      That she should never die, but her sweet face      And wonderful fair body should endure      Till the foundations of the mountains sure      Were molten in the sea; so utterly      Did he forget his mother's cruelty.\"            William Morris.    Meantime it came to be known all over that land, and in other lands to  which the fame of the fair Psyche had spread, that the mighty goddess  Aphrodite had declared herself the enemy of the princess. Therefore  none dared seek her in marriage, and although many a noble youth  sighed away his heart for love of her, she remained in her father's  palace like an exquisite rose whose thorns make those who fain would  have it for their own, fear to pluck it from the parent stem. Her  sisters married, and her father marvelled why so strange a thing  should come about and why the most beautiful by far of his three  daughters should remain unwed.    At length, laden with royal gifts, an embassy was sent by the king to  the oracle of Apollo to inquire what might be the will of the dwellers  on Olympus concerning his fairest daughter. In a horror of anxiety the  king and his queen and Psyche awaited the return of the ambassadors.  And when they returned, before ever a word was spoken, they knew that  the oracle had spoken Psyche's doom.    \"No mortal lover shall fair Psyche know,\" said the oracle. \"For  bridegroom she shall have a monster that neither man nor god can  resist. On the mountain top he awaits her coming. Woe unutterable  shall come to the king and to all the dwellers in his land if he dares  to resist the unalterable dictum of the deathless gods!\"        \"... Of dead corpses shalt thou be the king,      And stumbling through the dark land shalt thou go,      Howling for second death to end thy woe.\"            William Morris.    Only for a little while did the wretched king strive to resist the  decrees of fate. And in her own chamber, where so short a time before the  little princess had known the joy of something inexpressible--something  most exquisite--intangible--unknown--she sat, like a flower broken by the  ruthless storm, sobbing pitifully, dry-eyed, with sobs that strained her  soul, for the shameful, hideous fate that the gods had dealt her.    All night, until her worn-out body could no longer feel, her worn-out  mind think, and kind sleep came to bring her oblivion, Psyche faced  the horror for the sake of her father and of his people, that she knew  she could not avoid. When morning came, her handmaids, white-faced and  red-eyed, came to deck her in all the bridal magnificence that  befitted the most beautiful daughter of a king, and when she was  dressed right royally, and as became a bride, there started up the  mountain a procession at sight of which the gods themselves must have  wept. With bowed heads the king and queen walked before the litter  upon which lay their daughter in her marriage veil of saffron colour,  with rose wreath on her golden hair. White, white were the faces of  the maidens who bore the torches, and yet rose red were they by the  side of Psyche. Minstrels played wedding hymns as they marched  onwards, and it seemed as though the souls of unhappy shades sobbed  through the reeds and moaned through the strings as they played.    At length they reached the rocky place where they knew they must leave  the victim bride, and her father dared not meet her eyes as he turned  his head to go. Yet Psyche watched the procession wending its way  downhill. No more tears had she to shed, and it seemed to her that  what she saw was not a wedding throng, but an assembly of  broken-hearted people who went back to their homes with heavy feet  after burying one that they loved. She saw no sign of the monster who  was to be her bridegroom, yet at every little sound her heart grew  sick with horror, and when the night wind swept through the craggy  peaks and its moans were echoed in loneliness, she fell on her face in  deadly fear and lay on the cold rock in a swoon.    Yet, had Psyche known it, the wind was her friend. For Eros had used  Zephyrus as his trusty messenger and sent him to the mountain top to  find the bride of him \"whom neither man nor god could resist.\"  Tenderly--very tenderly--he was told, must he lift her in his arms,  and bear her to the golden palace in that green and pleasant land  where Eros had his home. So, with all the gentleness of a loving nurse  to a tired little child Zephyrus lifted Psyche, and sped with her in  his strong arms to the flowery meadows behind which towered the golden  palace of Eros, like the sun behind a sky of green and amber and blue  and rose. Deeply, in the weariness of her grief, Psyche slept, and  when she awoke it was to start up with the chill hands of the  realisation of terrible actualities on her heart. But when her eyes  looked round to find the barren rocks, the utter forsakenness, the  coming of an unnameable horror, before her she saw only fair groves  with trees bedecked with fruit and blossom, fragrant meadows, flowers  whose beauty made her eyes grow glad. And from the trees sang birds  with song more sweet than any that Psyche had ever known, and with  brilliant plumage which they preened caressingly when they had dipped  their wings in crystal-sparkling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22694"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 2, January, 1851 (#9)"],[1,"subjects because they are necessitous,  because 'the world is not their friend, nor the world's law,' might be  kept virtuous (or, at least, withheld from mischief) by being made  happy, by early encouragement, by holding out to them a reasonable hope  of obtaining, in good time, an honorable station and a competent income,  as the reward of literary pursuits, when followed with ability and  diligence, and recommended by good conduct.    \"My Lord, you are now on the Conservative side. Minor differences of  opinion are infinitely insignificant at this time, when in truth there  are but two parties in this kingdom--the Revolutionists and the  Loyalists; those who would destroy the constitution, and those who would  defend it, I can have no predilections for the present administration;  they have raised the devil who is now raging through the land: but, in  their present position, it is their business to lay him if they can; and  so far as their measures may be directed to that end, I heartily say,  God speed them! _If schemes like yours for the encouragement of letters,  have never entered into their wishes, there can be no place for them at  present in their intentions._ Government can have no leisure now for  attending to any thing but its own and our preservation; and the time  seems not far distant when the cares of war and expenditure will come  upon it once more with their all-engrossing importance. But when better  times shall arrive (whoever may live to see them), it will be worthy the  consideration of any government whether the institution of an Academy,  with salaries for its members (in the nature of literary or lay  benefices), might not be the means of retaining in _its_ interests, as  connected with their own, a certain number of influential men of  letters, who should hold those benefices, and a much greater number of  aspirants who would look to them in their turn. A yearly grant of ten  thousand pounds would endow ten such appointments of five hundred pounds  each for the elder class, and twenty-five of two hundred pounds each for  younger men; the latter eligible, of course, and preferably, but not  necessarily, to be elected to the higher benefices, as those fell  vacant, and as they should have improved themselves.    \"The good proposed by this, as a political measure, is not that of  retaining such persons to act as pamphleteers and journalists, but that  of preventing them from becoming such, in hostility to the established  order of things; and of giving men of letters, as a class, something to  look for beyond the precarious gains of literature; thereby inducing in  them a desire to support the existing institutions of their country, on  the stability of which their own welfare would depend.    \"Your Lordship's second question,--in what way the encouragement of  Government could most safely and beneficially be given,--is, in the  main, answered by what has been said upon the first. I do not enter into  any details of the proposed institution, for that would be to think of  fitting up a castle in the air. Nor is it worth while to examine how far  such an institution might be perverted. Abuses there would be, as in the  disposal of all preferments, civil, military, or ecclesiastical; but  there would be a more obvious check upon them; and where they occurred  they would be less injurious in their consequences than they are in the  state, the army and navy, or the church.    \"With regard to prizes, methinks they are better left to schools and  colleges. Honors are worth something to scientific men, because they are  conferred upon such men in other countries; at home there are precedents  for them in Newton and Davy, and the physicians and surgeons have them.  In my judgment, men of letters are better without them, unless they are  rich enough to bequeath to their family a good estate with the bloody  hand, and sufficiently men of the world to think such distinctions  appropriate. For myself, if we had a Guelphic order, I should choose to  remain a Ghibelline.    \"I have written thus fully and frankly, not dreaming that your proposal  is likely to be matured and carried into effect, but in the spirit of  good will, and as addressing one by whom there is no danger that I can  be misunderstood. _One thing alone I ask from the legislature, and in  the name of justice,--that the injurious law of copyright should be  repealed, and that the family of an author should not be deprived of  their just and natural rights in his works when his permanent reputation  is established._ This I ask with the earnestness of a man who is  conscious that he has labored for posterity.\"    The publication of this letter, and of the correspondence between  Southey and Sir Robert Peel, in which the poet declines being knighted,  on account of his poverty--a correspondence eminently honorable to the  late Prime Minister, has occasioned an eloquent letter from Walter  Savage Landor to Lord Brougham on the same subject.          CLASSICAL NOVELS.      The _Edinburgh Review_ rebukes the daring of those uneducated  story-tellers who profane by their intrusion the holy lands, the sacred  names, and golden ages of art. We have acceptable specimens of the  \"classical novel\" by Dr. Croly, Lockhart, Bulwer, and Collins (the  author of \"Antonini\"), and in this country by Mrs. Child and William  Ware; but nineteen of every twenty who have attempted such compositions  have failed entirely. The Edinburgh Reviewer, after showing that the  writers whom he arraigns have merely parodied the exterior life of our  own time, proceeds--    \"It is not uncommon to excuse such deviations from historical propriety  by saying, that if the mere accidents have been neglected, the essential  humanity has been only more fully realized: and those who quarrel with  the neglect are stigmatized as pedants having no eyes except for the  external. We think, however, that it will be found, in most cases where  the plea is set up, that the humanity for which the sacrifice has been  made is equally external with that which has been disregarded, and much  more commonplace and conventional; being in fact, only the outer life of  existing society. We are met, of course, by the triumphant answer that  Shakspeare wrote Roman plays with a very slender knowledge of the  classics. It would be sufficient to reply, that we are speaking of cases  where ignorance of antiquity is not counterbalanced by any very  exuberant or profound knowledge of human nature. Possibly posterity may  have to deal with another myriad-minded dramatist whose poverty is  better than other men's riches; but it must not be rashly presumed that  he is likely to appear at all; or, if at all, with the same deficiency  of learning which was not unnatural three hundred years back. Meanwhile,  it is a perverse and pernicious paradox to maintain that Shakspeare's  consummate genius was in any way connected with his 'little Latin and  less Greek,' or that he might not have portrayed the Romans yet more  successfully if he had known more about them. Believing this, we are not  presuming, as the same absurd reasoning would have it, to set up  ourselves against him. We do not say that any other man in his age or  our own, however great his command of learning, could possibly mend  those plays by touching them; but we say that Shakspeare himself, with  increased knowledge, might have made them yet more perfect. It is easy  to oppose inspiration to scholastic culture; to coin antitheses between  nature and art; and to say that Shakspeare's Romans are more ideally  true than Niebuhr's. There is some truth in all this; but it is not to  the purpose. A poet like Burns may have really known more of classical  life than a critic like Blair; nay, it may be that if Keats or Tennyson  had been a senior medallist at Cambridge, they would not have produced  any thing not only so beautiful but so purely Greek as _Endymion_ or  _Oenone_. In what we were just saying we were thinking of the very  highest minds. And, when we recollect how gracefully Milton could walk  under the weight of his immense learning, we need not fear that the  Alantean shoulders of Shakspeare would have been oppressed by a similar  load. The knowledge of antiquity may operate on the recipient so as to  produce mere bookishness and intellectual sophistication; but in itself  it is a real and legitimate part of all knowledge, a portion of that  truth with which poets are conversant, a lesson set in other schools  than those where man is teacher. We know not what were Shakspeare's  feelings with respect to his own deficiencies; but we cannot believe  that the same modesty which besought his friend to chide with Fortune,  'the guilty goddess of his harmful deeds,' would have shrunk from  confessing want of knowledge as an evil to be lamented, at the same time  that it was imputed to want of opportunity. If he was self-centred, it  was in his strength, not in his weakness. His eulogists may show the  greatness of their faith in him by doubting whether he could have  assimilated the learning which obstructs Ben Jonson's _Catiline_ and  _Sejanus_; but we have no proofs that he thought so meanly of himself or  of that which he happened not to possess. On the contrary, it may be  argued, from the diligent use which he has made of such information as  he had, that he would gladly have taken advantage of more. Arnold, in  his Roman History, has noted the poet's perception of historical truth  in a matter where it might well have been overlooked; and future critics  may perhaps spend their time more profitably in discovering other  indications of a like vigilant industry than in laboring to prove that  the absence of so servile a virtue has been conducive to his preeminence  as a creative artist.\"          SLIDING SCALE OF THE INCONSOLABLES.
