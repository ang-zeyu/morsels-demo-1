[Music]    We are come, all come, with the crowded throng,  To join our notes in a plaintive song;  For the bond man sighs, and the scalding tear  Runs down his cheek while we mingle here.    We are come, all come, with a hallowed vow,  At the shrine of slavery never to bow,  For the despot's reign o'er hill and plain,  Spreads grief and woe in his horrid train.    We are come, all come, a determined band,  To rescue the slave from the tyrant's hand;  And our prayers shall ascend with our songs to Him  Who sits in the midst of the cherubim.    We are come, all come, in the strength of youth,  In the light of hope and the power of truth;  And we joy to see in our ranks to-day,  The honored locks of the good and grey.    We are come, all come, in our holy might,  And freedom's foes shall be put to flight;  Oh God! with favoring smiles from thee,  Our songs shall soon chant the victory.          THE LAW OF LOVE.    Words by a Lady. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    Blest is the man whose tender heart    Feels all another's pain,  To whom the supplicating eye    Was never raised in vain,    Was never raised in vain.    Whose breast expands with generous warmth,    A stranger's woe to feel,  And bleeds in pity o'er the wound,    He wants the power to heal,    He wants the power to heal.    He spreads his kind supporting arms,    To every child of grief;  His secret bounty largely flows,    And brings unasked relief.    To gentle offices of love    His feet are never slow;  He views, through mercy's melting eye,    A brother in his foe.    To him protection shall be shown,    And mercy from above  Descend on those, who thus fulfil    The perfect law of love.          Oh! Charity!      Oh charity! thou heavenly grace,    All tender, soft, and kind,  A friend to all the human race,    To all that's good inclined.    The man of charity extends    To all his helping hand;  His kindred, neighbors, foes, and friends,    His pity may command.    The sick, the prisoner, deaf, and blind,    And all the sons of grief,  In him a benefactor find;    He loves to give relief.    'Tis love that makes religion sweet    'Tis love that makes us rise;  With willing minds, and ardent feet,    To yonder happy skies.          THE MERCY SEAT.    Words by Mrs. Sigourney. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    From every stormy wind that blows,  From every swelling tide of woes,  There is a calm, a sure retreat--  Our refuge is the Mercy-seat.    There is a place where Jesus sheds  The oil of gladness on our heads,  A place than all beside more sweet--  We seek the blood-bought Mercy-seat.    There is a spot where spirits blend,  Where friend holds fellowship with friend;  Though sundered far, by faith we meet,  Around one common Mercy-Seat.    Ah! whither could we flee for aid,  When hunted, scourged, oppressed, dismayed,--  Or how our bloody foes defeat,  Had suffering slaves no Mercy-Seat!    Oh! let these hands forget their skill,  These tongues be silent, cold, and still,  These throbbing hearts forget to beat,  If we forget the Mercy-Seat.          Friend of the Friendless.      God of my life! to thee I call,  Afflicted at thy feet I fall;  When the great water-floods prevail,  Leave not my trembling heart to fail.    Friend of the friendless and the faint!  Where should I lodge my deep complaint?  Where but with thee, whose open door  Invites the helpless and the poor?    Did ever mourner plead with thee,  And thou refuse that mourner's plea?  Does not thy word still fixed remain,  That none shall seek thy face in vain?    Poor though I am, despised, forgot,  Yet God, my God forgets me not;  And he is safe, he must succeed,  For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead.          WAKE YE NUMBERS!    Words by Lewis. Air, \"Strike the Cymbals.\"      [Music]    Wake ye numbers! from your slumbers    Hear the song of freedom pour!  By its shaking, fiercely breaking,    Every chain upon our shore.  Flags are waving, all tyrants braving,    Proudly, freely, o'er our plains;  Let no minions check our pinions,    While a single grief remains.  Proud oblations, thou Queen of nations!    Have been poured upon they waters;    Afric's bleeding sons and daughters,  Now before us, loud implore us,    Looking to Jehovah's throne,  Chains are wearing, hearts despairing,    Will ye hear a nation's moan?  Soothe their sorrow, ere the morrow    Change their aching hearts to stone:  Then the light of nature's smile  Freedom's realm shall bless the while;  And the pleasure mercy brings  Flow from all her latent springs;  Delight shall spread, shall spread her shining wings,      Rejoicing, Rejoicing, Rejoicing.    Daily, nightly, burning brightly,    Glory's pillar fills the air;  Hearts are waking, chains are breaking,    Freedom bids her sons prepare:  O'er the ocean, in proud devotion,    Incense rises to the skies;  From our mountains, o'er our fountains,    See, our Eagle proudly flies!  What deploring impedes his soaring?    Millions still in bondage sighing!    Long in deep oppression lying!  Shall their story mar our glory?    Must their life in sorrow flow?  Tears are falling! fetters galling!    Listen to the cry of woe!  Still oppressing! never blessing!    Shall their grief no ending know?  Yes! our nation yet shall feel;  Time shall break the chain of steel;  Then the slave shall nobly stand;  Peace shall smile with lustre bland;  Glory shall crown our happy land--      Forever.          COMFORT FOR THE BONDMAN.    Air--\"Indian Philosopher.\"      [Music]    Come on, my partners in distress,  My comrades in this wilderness,    Who groan beneath your chains;  A while forget your griefs and fears,  And look beyond this vale of tears,    To yon celestial plains.    Beyond the bounds of time and space,  Look forward to that heavenly place,    Which mortals never trod;  On faith's strong eagle pinions rise,  Work out your passage to the skies,    And scale the mount of God.    If, like our Lord, we suffer here,  We shall before his face appear,    And at his side sit down;  To patient faith the prize is sure,  For all who to the end endure    Shall wear a glorious crown.    Thrice blessed, exalted, blissful hope!  It lifts our fainting spirits up,    It brings to life the dead;  Our bondage here will soon be past,  Then we shall rise and reign at last,    Triumphant with our Head.          Come and see the Works of God.      Lift up to God the shout of joy,  Let all the earth its powers employ,    To sound his glorious praise;  Say, unto God--\"How great art thou!  Thy foes before thy presence bow!    How gracious are thy ways!    \"To thee all lands their homage bring,  They raise the song, they shout, they sing    The honors of thy name.\"  Come! see the wondrous works of God;  How dreadful is his vengeful rod!    How wide extends his fame!    He made a highway through the sea,  His people, long-enslaved, to free,    And give them Canaan's land;  Through endless years his reign extends,  His piercing eye to earth he bends--    Ye despots! fear his hand.    O! bless our God, lift up your voice  Ye people! sing aloud--rejoice--    His mighty praise declare;  The Lord hath made our bondage cease,  Broke off our chains, brought sure release,    And turned to praise our prayer.          HARK! A VOICE FROM HEAVEN.    Words by Oliver Johnson. Music--\"Zion.\"      [Music]    Hark! a voice from heaven proclaiming,    Comfort to the mourning slave;  God has heard him long complaining,    And extends his arm to save;      Proud oppression    Soon shall find a shameful grave;      Proud oppression,    Soon shall find a shameful end.    See, the light of truth is breaking    Full and clear on every hand;  And the voice of mercy speaking,    Now is heard through all the land:      Firm and fearless,    See the friends of freedom stand.    Lo! the nation is arousing    From its slumber long and deep;  And the friends of God are waking,    Never, never more to sleep,      While a bondman,    In his chains remains to weep.    Long, too long, have we been dreaming    O'er our country's sin and shame:  Let us now, the time redeeming,    Press the helpless captive's claim--      Till exulting,    He shall cast aside his chain.          THE PLEASANT LAND WE LOVE.    Words by N.P. Willis. Air, Carrier Dove.      [Music]    Joy to the pleasant land we love,    The land our fathers trod!

WHY THE CHIPMUNK HAS BLACK STRIPES      At one time, the animals had tribes and chiefs, like men. It was when  the porcupine was chief, that a council was called.    A great fire was lighted, for it was night. When all the animals were  seated around the fire, the porcupine spoke.    [Illustration]    \"Friends,\" he said, \"we have met here to settle a great question: 'Shall  we have night all the time, or day?'\" At this, all the animals began to  talk at once. There was great confusion. The night animals kept  shouting, \"Night, night! Always night!\" Others of the animals cried,  \"Day, day! Always day!\" Still others called for \"Day and night!\"    There was so much noise that it could not be decided what was best.    At last the animals grew tired of calling. One by one the voices grew  fainter, and the shouting ceased. Of the night animals, the voice of the  bear alone was heard. He had a big voice and still kept calling, \"Night,  night! Always night!\"    The animals who wanted day all the time, and those who wanted day and  night, also became quiet,--all except the chipmunk. He chattered on, \"We  will have light--and then night. We will have light--and then night.  Chee, chee, chee!\"    Then the bear, too, became tired. He was fat and lazy, and so sleepy! He  thought he would take a short nap.    But all night long the wide-awake little chipmunk kept up his song. Not  for a moment did he stop to rest. Out of the dark came his voice, sure  and cheery, \"We will have light--and then night. We will have  light--and then night! Chee, chee, chee!\"    And before the animals knew it, the sun began to rise.    At the first rays of light, the bear sat up, blinked, and rubbed his  eyes. He saw that while he had slept, light had indeed come. He knew  that he and the night animals had been beaten in the council, and that  the chipmunk and the animals who wanted day and night had won.    The bear was very angry. He struck at the chipmunk with his paw. But he  was clumsy, and the chipmunk was spry!    The chipmunk laughed and sprang into a hole of a hollow tree near by.  But those black stripes on the chipmunk's back show where the paw of the  black bear touched him as he slipped into the tree.    Ever since this council, and the little chipmunk called so long and loud  for \"light and night,\" we have had day and night.          HOW TWO INDIAN BOYS SETTLED A QUARREL      [Illustration]    Flying Squirrel and Lightning Bow were two little Indian boys. They  lived by Singing River, and they played from sunrise to sunset. They  were as happy as the day was long.    In the summer, they fished and swam in Singing River, and they shot  their arrows into chipmunk and woodpecker holes. Sometimes they played  \"Dodging Arrows,\" a game their mother had taught them when they were  very young.    In the winter, they jumped into fleecy snowdrifts and rolled until their  little bronze bodies took on a red-raspberry tint. Then they would send  their snow-snakes skimming over the hard crust of snow.    Snow-snakes were small rods of wood, polished smooth with resin, oil, or  wax. They could be thrown long distances. Long Moose--Lightning Bow and  Flying Squirrel's father--could throw a snow-snake a mile and a half,  over the crust of the snow. But the snow-snakes he used were eight feet  long and tipped with lead.    It was the Moon of Berries. Six times had Flying Squirrel and Lightning  Bow seen the Berry Moon hang her horn in the night sky. And not once in  all their lives had they quarreled.    One morning, Flying Squirrel and Lightning Bow planned a foot race.  Seven times they were to run. Three times, Flying Squirrel had made the  goal first. Three times, Lightning Bow had outrun him. The seventh race  was claimed by each. No one saw them run, so no one could decide the  game. And they fell to quarreling.    [Illustration]    Louder and louder their voices were raised. More and more angry they  grew.    White Fawn, their mother, was baking corn bread on the coals of the  wigwam fire. The angry voices reached her ears. She stepped to the door.    \"For shame!\" she called. \"Go and set up your sticks.\"    [Illustration]    Then she showed Lightning Bow and Flying Squirrel how to set up three  sticks so they would stand for many days.    \"Now go into the wood, set up your sticks, and leave your quarrel  there,\" she said. \"When the Berry Moon has passed, you shall return and  see if the sticks are still standing.    \"If they lean toward the rising sun, Lightning Bow was right. If they  lean toward the setting sun, Flying Squirrel won. If they have fallen  down, neither was right and neither won.\"    Lightning Bow and Flying Squirrel went into the wood and set up their  sticks. Then they began to throw balls with willow wands, and soon they  were happy again.           *       *       *       *       *    The sun had risen and set many times. The Berry Moon had passed. It was  the Thunder Moon, when White Fawn said to Lightning Bow and Flying  Squirrel, \"Today you may go into the wood and see if your sticks are  still standing.\"    Hand in hand, the two little Indian boys ran into the wood. They found  only a heap of rotting sticks.    Flying Squirrel and Lightning Bow stood and looked at the sticks. They  thought and thought.    \"What did we set up the sticks for?\" each asked of the other.    And for the life of them they could not remember what they had quarreled  about, and why they had set up the sticks!          HOW MICE OVERCAME THE WARRIORS      Once a tribe of the Iroquois became very warlike and cruel. They liked  to follow the warpath rather than the hunting trails.    These warriors thought only of the war dance. They forgot to give thanks  for the sweet waters of the maple, and for the planting season. Neither  did they remember to praise the Great Spirit, in song and dance, for the  juicy strawberries, and the waving green corn, as once they had done.    To fight was the one desire of their lives, the one thought that filled  their minds. They boasted that none were so fierce and bloodthirsty as  they.    \"Our arrows fall like leaves of the pine,\" they said, \"and always are  they red with blood. Our war shirts have many scalp locks on them.\"    One day, a dispute arose with a neighboring tribe of their nation. The  Peace Wigwam was not far away, but these warriors would not take their  quarrel to it, as was the custom. The fighting Indians would have none  of the Peace Wigwam.    [Illustration]    \"Let the women and papooses sit in the sun at the door of the Peace  Wigwam,\" they said scornfully. \"Chiefs are for the warpath.\"    A fierce cry was raised, and the war dance was begun. The chiefs painted  their bodies, donned their war shirts, sharpened their tomahawks, tipped  their arrows, and tightened their bowstrings.    [Illustration]    But by the time they had made ready, the sun had set, and the blanket of  darkness had fallen upon them. A council was quickly called. It was  decided that they would not start to war until moonrise. So the warriors  lay down to sleep.    As they slept, another council was called. This was not a council of  men, but of mice.    From long and short trails they came, hundreds and hundreds of mice, for  all had heard the warriors boast of their strength.    \"Now,\" said the mice, \"we will show these boasters how weak are men,  and how strong are little mice.\"    When all the mice were gathered about the council tree, the leader spoke  thus: \"My brothers, listen! The Great Spirit did not give men strength,  that they should fight and kill one another. The Great Spirit did not  make men powerful, that they should strike down and kill the weaker  animals. Let us show these fierce warriors that it is the weak who are  strong, and the strong who are weak. Let every mouse destroy at least  one weapon before the moon shall rise.\"    At this, all the mice set to work. Snap, snap, snap, went the bowstrings  on all sides. Then the sharp little teeth began on the feathers that  winged the poisoned arrows. Soon the feathers lay in bits about the  ground.    Next, the deerskin cords that bound the sling shots were cut in two, and  before the moon had risen, every weapon had been made useless; every  Indian had been disarmed,--and the mice had scampered away.    The warriors awoke. Again the war cry was raised. They sprang to their  feet and seized their weapons, but found them useless. Their bows had no  strings; their arrows, no wings; their slings, no cords.    The warriors who boasted that they were the strongest and fiercest on  the earth, had been made powerless by mice.    [Illustration]          WHY CROWS ARE POOR      After the Great Spirit had made the Red Children and had given them this  beautiful land in which to live, he sent them a great gift,--the gift of  the corn.    _Ga gaah_, the Crow, claims it was he who brought this gift. He says he  was called to the wigwam of the Great Spirit in the sky. A grain of corn  was placed in his ear, and he was told to carry it to earth, to the Red  Children.    Therefore, as _Ga gaah_ brought the gift, he claims he has a right to  pull what corn he needs. _Ga gaah_ says he does not \"steal\" corn. He  simply takes what belongs to him, his rightful share.    And surely _Ga gaah_ is not greedy! He never takes more corn than he  wants for himself. He never hides or stores it away. He takes just what  he wishes to eat at the time, and no more, for crows never think of  to-morrow.    In summer, they are happy in the cornfields, guarding the roots from  insect enemies, and pulling the tender blades whenever they are hungry.    [Illustration]    But when winter comes, the crows are sad. Many councils are held.  Sometimes a council tree will be black with crows. All are so poor and  so hungry, that they get together to try to plan a better way"]]]
