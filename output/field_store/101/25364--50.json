If any youth, unhappily initiated in these odious and debasing  vices, should happen to see what I am now writing, I beg him to read  the command of God, to the Israelites, Deut. xxi. The father and mother  are to take the bad son 'and bring him to the elders of the city; and  they shall say to the elders, this our son will not obey our voice: he  is a _glutton_ and a _drunkard_. And all the men of the city shall  stone him with stones, that he die.' This will give him some idea of  the odiousness of his crime, at least in the sight of Heaven.    But indulgence _far short_ of gross drunkenness and gluttony is to be  deprecated; and the more so, because it is too often looked upon as  being no crime at all. Nay, there are many persons, who boast of a  refined taste in matters connected with eating and drinking, who are so  far from being ashamed of employing their thoughts on the subject, that  it is their boast that they do it.    Gregory, one of the Christian fathers, says: 'It is not the _quantity_  or the _quality_ of the meat, or drink, but the _love of it_, that is  condemned:' that is to say, the indulgence beyond the absolute demands  of nature; the hankering after it; the neglect of some duty or other  for the sake of the enjoyments of the table. I believe, however, there  _may_ be error, both in _quantity_ and _quality_.    This _love_ of what are called 'good eating and drinking,' if very  unamiable in grown persons, is perfectly hateful in a _youth_; and, if  he _indulge_ in the propensity, he is already half ruined. To warn you  against acts of fraud, robbery, and violence, is not here my design.  Neither am I speaking against acts which the jailor and the hangman  punish, nor against those moral offences which all men condemn, but  against indulgences, which, by men in general, are deemed not only  _harmless_, but _meritorious_; but which observation has taught me to  regard as destructive to human happiness; and against which all ought  to be cautioned, even in their boyish days.    Such indulgences are, in the first place, very _expensive_. The  materials are costly, and the preparation still more so. What a  monstrous thing, that, in order to satisfy the appetite of one person  there must be one or two others _at work constantly_.[3] More fuel,  culinary implements, kitchen room: what! all these merely to tickle the  palate of four or five people, and especially people who can hardly pay  their bills! And, then, the _loss of time_--the time spent in pleasing  the palate!    \"A young man,\" says an English writer, \"some years ago, offered himself  to me, as an _amanuensis_, for which he appeared to be perfectly  qualified. The terms were settled, and I requested him to sit down, and  begin; but looking out of the window, whence he could see the church  clock, he said, somewhat hastily, 'I _cannot_ stop _now_ sir, I must go  to _dinner_.' 'Oh!' said I, 'you _must_ go to dinner, must you! Let the  dinner, which you _must_ wait upon to-day, have your constant services,  then; for you and I shall never agree.'    \"He had told me that he was in _great distress_ for want of employment;  and yet, when relief was there before his eyes, he could forego it for  the sake of getting at his eating and drinking three or four hours  sooner than was necessary.\"    This anecdote is good, so far as it shows the folly of an unwillingness  to deny ourselves in small matters, in any circumstances. And yet  punctuality, even at meals, is not to be despised.    _Water-drinkers_ are universally _laughed at_: but, it has always  seemed to me, that they are amongst the most welcome of guests, and  that, too, though the host be by no means of a niggardly turn. The  truth is, they give _no trouble_; they occasion _no anxiety_ to please  them; they are sure not to make their sittings _inconveniently long_;  and, above all, their example teaches _moderation_ to the rest of the  company.    Your notorious 'lovers of good cheer' are, on the contrary, not to be  invited without _due reflection_. To entertain one of them is a serious  business; and as people are not apt voluntarily to undertake such  pieces of business, the well-known 'lovers of good eating and drinking'  are left, very generally, to enjoy it by themselves, and at their own  expense.    But, all other considerations aside, _health_, one of the most valuable  of earthly possessions, and without which all the rest are worth  nothing, bids us not only to refrain from _excess_ in eating and  drinking, but to stop short of what might be indulged in without any  _apparent_ impropriety.    The words of ECCLESIASTICUS ought to be often read by young people.  'Eat modestly that which is set before thee, and _devour_ not, lest  thou be _hated_. When thou sittest amongst many, reach not thine hand  out first of all. _How little is sufficient for a man well taught! A  wholesome sleep_ cometh of a temperate belly. Such a man _riseth up in  the morning_, and is _well at ease with himself_. Be not too hasty of  meats; for excess of meats bringeth sickness, and choleric disease  cometh of gluttony. By surfeit have many perished, and he that _dieteth  himself prolongeth his life_. Show not thy valiantness in wine; for  wine hath destroyed many.'    How true are these words! How well worthy of a constant place in our  memories! Yet, what pains have been taken to apologize for a life  contrary to these precepts! And, what punishment can be too great, what  mark of infamy sufficiently signal, for those pernicious villains of  talent, who have employed that talent in the composition of  _Bacchanalian songs_; that is to say, pieces of fine and captivating  writing in praise of one of the most odious and destructive vices in  the black catalogue of human depravity!    'Who,' says the eccentric, but laborious Cobbett, 'what man, ever  performed a greater quantity of labor than I have performed? Now, in a  great measure, I owe my capability to perform this labor to my  disregard of dainties. I ate, during one whole year, one mutton chop  every day. Being once in town, with one son (then a little boy) and a  clerk, while my family was in the country, I had, for several weeks,  nothing but legs of mutton. The first day, a leg of mutton boiled or  _roasted_; second, _cold_; third, _hashed_; then, leg of mutton  _boiled_; and so on.    'When I have been by myself, or nearly so, I have _always_ proceeded  thus: given directions for having _every day the same thing_, or  alternately as above, and every day exactly at the same hour, so as to  prevent the necessity of any _talk_ about the matter. I am certain  that, upon an average, I have not, during my life, spent more than  _thirty-five minutes a day at table_, including all the meals of the  day. I like, and I take care to have, good and clean victuals; but, if  wholesome and clean, that is enough. If I find it, by chance, _too  coarse_ for my appetite, I put the food aside, or let somebody do it;  and leave the appetite to gather keenness.'                         *      *      *      *      *    Now I have no special desire to recommend _mutton chops_ to my readers,  nor to hold out the example of the individual whose language I have  quoted, as worthy of general imitation. There is one lesson to be  learned, however. Cobbett's never tiring industry is well known. And if  we can rely on his own statements in regard to his manner of eating, we  see another proof that what are called 'dainties,' and even many things  which are often supposed to be necessaries, are very far from being  indispensable to health or happiness.    I am even utterly _opposed_ to the rapid eating of which he speaks. In  New England especially, the danger is on the other side. 'Were it not  from respect to others, I never would wish for more than eight minutes  to eat my dinner in,' said a merchant to me one day. Now _I_ can  _swallow_ a meal at any time, in _five_ minutes; but this is not  _eating_. If it is, the teeth were made--as well as the saliva--almost  in vain. No! this _swallowing_ down a meal in five or even ten minutes,  so common among the active, enterprising, and industrious people of  this country, is neither healthy, nor decent, nor economical. And  instead of spending only _thirty-five minutes_ a day in eating; every  man, woman, and child ought, as a matter of duty, to spend about  _twice_ the time in that way. This would give the teeth and salivary  glands an opportunity to come up to the work which God in nature  assigned them. We may indeed cheat them for a time, but not with  impunity, for a day of reckoning will come; and some of our rapid  eaters will find their bill (in stomach or liver complaints, or gout or  rheumatism) rather large. They will probably lose more time in this  way, than they can possibly save by eating rapidly.    The idea of preventing conversation about what we eat is also idle,  though Dr. Franklin and many other wise men, thought otherwise. Some of  our students in _commons_ and elsewhere, suppose themselves highly  meritorious because they have adopted the plan of appointing one of  their number to read to the company, while the rest are eating. But  they are sadly mistaken. Nothing is gained by the practice. On the  contrary, much is lost by it. The bow cannot always remain bent,  without injury. Neither can the mind always be kept 'toned' to a high  pitch. _Mind_ and _body_ must and will have their relaxations.    I am not an advocate for _wasting time_ or for _eating more_ than is  necessary. Nay, I even believe, on the contrary, with most _medical_  men, that we generally eat about twice as much as nature requires. But  I do say, and with emphasis, that food must be _masticated_.    Before I dismiss the subject of temperance, let me beseech you to  resolve to free yourselves from slavery to _tea_ and _coffee_."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23875"],[0,"The Relief of Mafeking (#9)"],[1,"like rocks among the deep moving waters; the St. George's ensign  floated from the shore flagstaffs, and an air of whiteness and tidiness  proclaimed the naval station.    The railway from Cape Town runs so close to the shore of the bay that  you cannot hear yourself speak for the noise of bursting surf. It  brought me to Simonstown in the full glare and heat of the afternoon.  The prisoners were encamped about a hundred yards out of the town, and  as we walked through the street we spoke with pity of men imprisoned on  such a day. What we expected I do not quite know--dungeons perhaps, or  cells hewn out of the rock--but it was with something like a shock of  disappointment or relief (according to our notions of appropriate  treatment for prisoners) that we caught our first view of the  encampment. Just beyond the town the hillside takes a gentler slope,  dipping a lawn of sea-grass into the water; and it was upon this  charming spot, enclosed with a double fence, that the prisoners were  quartered. We pressed our faces against the wires and stared, much as  one stares in the Zoo at a cageful of newly-arrived animals that have  cost a great deal of money and maybe a life or two. Fine, big men,  stalwart and burned brown by the sun; stern-looking, but with that air  of large contentment they wear who live much alone and out of doors;  massive of jaw and forehead, moulded after a grand pattern. They were  lying on the grass, standing in little groups, sauntering up and down  in the hot sunshine, playing cricket with ponderous energy, bathing and  sporting in the clear apple-green water. It was not their contentment  that surprised me, but the perfection of their circumstances. They were  encamped on such a spot as people pay large sums for the privilege of  pitching tents upon; they were numerous enough to make themselves  independent of alien company; the sun was shining, the sea breeze  blowing; they had food and drink, and tobacco to smoke; where they  bathed an eight-oar gig from the _Powerful_ swung on the swell, not so  much to prevent escape as to render assistance to tired swimmers.    So our prisoners blinked in the sun and listened to the organ-note of  the surf, and brooded on the most beautiful picture I have ever seen:  masses of bare rock towering into the bright sky, and an endless pageant  of seas rolling grandly homeward from the south, from the infinite  purple and blue of the Indian Ocean, grounding at the edge of the green  lawn and showering snow upon the hot rocks.          VI    IN THE EDDIES OF A GREAT WHIRL      When I arrived at Modder River Camp, on February 17th, the guns were  being hauled back from the hills into camp, tents were being struck, and  waggon transport organised. The plain was a cloud of hot, whirling sand  that shrouded near objects as closely as a fog, but, instead of the damp  coldness of a fog, the plain was radiating heat that sent the  thermometer inside one's tent up to 135 degrees. The place that a few  days before had been resounding with artillery was now silent and (by  comparison) deserted; buck waggons took the place of gun carriages, and  the ambulance cart carried mails from home. One thought of Modder River  as being surely at \"the front,\" but here was the place, here were the  troops, the guns, the hospitals, the sand-enveloped cemetery, and yet  one seemed to be no nearer than before to actual war. As for news, there  was less even than at Cape Town. A few telegrams, days old, fluttered  from the notice-board, and in at headquarters I found that we who had  been sixty hours on the journey from Cape Town were hailed as  newsbearers. There was a press censor, yet one could not send press  telegrams; headquarters had moved on to Jacobsdaal; telegrams must go  through headquarters, and the wire to Jacobsdaal was only to be used for  military purposes. This was something like a block, so Mr. Amery, of the  _Times_, and I, resolved to ride over to Jacobsdaal and see if we could  get any news.    [Illustration: MR. G. LENTHAL CHEATLE, F.R.C.S.    _Consulting Surgeon to Her Majesty's Forces in South Africa_]    We crossed the Riet and Modder drifts, and passed over the island where  the shells and bullets had been singing so shrilly on the day of the big  fight. When we passed the birds were singing instead, sending down with  the cooing pigeons a chorus from the trees. No one could tell us whether  or not the twelve miles to Jacobsdaal were free from the enemy; people  thought so, but they were not quite sure. So we rode along, observing  the dry veldt not without interest, but the lonely road heaved up and  down over the plain and revealed little sign of human occupation. Once  we passed a convoy carrying stores to the front, and at about the eighth  mile a little Boer camp of about a dozen tents, all deserted, and  apparently in haste, for there were half-emptied tins of provisions and  a few cooking utensils scattered about, and a dead horse lay by the  roadside. The heat was very great, and was only supportable when one  kept a drenched handkerchief under one's hat. Indeed, officers who had  come straight out from India protested that they never felt there  anything like the heat of that South African drought.    Jacobsdaal, a little white town or village near the river, appeared at  last from a ridge of the plain. It contained an inn, and the inn  contained cups of tea--a fact in connection with Jacobsdaal that I shall  long remember. In about an hour we were ready to look about a little,  but at headquarters we could only learn that the front had again moved  forward. We could not advance without transport, and we could get no  quarters, so we lay down in a stony field under the stars, and made a  poor shift at sleeping through a concert of complaining oxen and cocks  cheering all night long, with an undertone of rumbling wheels on the  distant road.    Next morning early I rode back to Modder, where I collected with  difficulty two sorry but useful nags and a Cape cart. On my way out I  passed a sentry, who brought me up with the usual cry, \"Halt! who goes  there?\"    \"Friend,\" said I.    \"Advance, friend, and give the countersign.\"    Now I did not know the countersign, and I had to tell him so. The  private soldier is sometimes zealous and often stupid, and occasionally  both; and in the pause that followed my answer I heard the click of his  rifle. In that second of time I remembered a story which I had heard the  day before of a sentry at Modder, who, when the guard came up in the  dark to relieve him, made the usual challenge. \"It's only us, old man,\"  said the sergeant. \"None of your blooming us,\" said the sentry, and shot  the sergeant dead.    However the sentry was soon persuaded, and when I passed the outpost,  the sentry who should really have stopped me and examined my passport  treated me as a field-officer and presented arms, so I rode away back to  the dust of Modder. There I collected as much forage as possible, and  the next day rode back with my caravan to Jacobsdaal. Once more there  was a block. The front forty miles away; no more forage, no rations  even; and I starved officially, but was entertained privately by the  commandant. The front was reaching away forward along the road to  Bloemfontein; and as telegrams had to be censored there and handed in at  Modder River, fifty miles away, and as I had no despatch riders, I  decided that the game was up on this line. A dose of fever helped my  decision, and held me afterwards at Modder when great things were  happening at Paardeberg. But for the day during which I stayed in  Jacobsdaal I studied the little town and its alien inhabitants.    Jacobsdaal stands four-square on the northern bank of the Riet River,  eleven miles east-south-east from Modder; and the manner of its  occupation, as described to me by General Wavell (who captured it on the  15th of February and remained in it as commandant), seems to have been  surprisingly neat and effectual. General Chermside, commanding the 14th  Brigade, left Enslin on the 11th and marched to Ramdam, where he was  joined by General Wavell, commanding the 15th Brigade, who had moved  from Graspan. From Ramdam the two brigades marched almost due east to  Dekiel's Drift, which they were delayed in crossing during the whole of  the 13th. They started again on the next evening and made a night march  to Wegdraai, where they arrived at four o'clock on the morning of the  15th. An officer of the North Staffordshire Regiment told me that he  never saw anything so impressive as that night march. The horizon was  level all round like the sea, and all night long it was alive with  streams of lightning that lighted up the plain with the brigade crawling  across it through the thunder. On the 15th General Wavell's brigade was  detached, and at midday started to march upon Jacobsdaal. The brigade  was strengthened by about seventy men of the C.I.V. (who acted as  scouts) and by a battery of artillery. The North Staffordshires acted as  advance guard, the South Wales Borderers and the Cheshire Regiment  formed the main body, and the East Lancashires brought up the rear--half  a battalion as reserves and half as rear-guard with the baggage.    The position was an admirable one for the enemy. General Wavell had the  town ahead and the river on the left parallel with his line of march;  and as he approached, the Boers (about 400 strong) opened a brisk fire  on his flank from the river-bed. The fire was directed at the C.I.V.'s,  who were advancing on the right bank of the river; but it had a double  objective, since what missed the C.I.V.'s had a fair chance of finding  the Staffordshires, who were advancing on a parallel ridge still further  to the right. The C.I.V.'s had a good many horses killed, and many of  the men were wounded and \"dropped,\" but I believe only one was killed.  Finding the attack was coming from the left, the General showed his"]]]
