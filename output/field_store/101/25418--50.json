[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#9)"],[1," way through  intellectual and moral quagmires, had taken good care to point out to her  certain intellectual movements and certain moral lessons; just as she had  in their various walks and drives pointed out matters of  interest--architectural beauties and spots of historic import.  And she  had taken in, loyally accepted, and thoroughly assimilated all that she  had been told.  But there were other lessons which were for her young  eyes; facts which the older eyes had ceased to notice, if they had ever  noticed them at all.  The self-content, the sex-content in the endless  tide of young men that thronged the streets and quads and parks; the all-  sufficing nature of sport or study, to whichever their inclinations  tended.  The small part which womankind seemed to have in their lives.  Stephen had had, as we know, a peculiar training; whatever her instincts  were, her habits were largely boy habits.  Here she was amongst boys, a  glorious tide of them; it made now and again her heart beat to look at  them.  And yet amongst them all she was only an outsider.  She could not  do anything better than any of them.  Of course, each time she went out,  she became conscious of admiring glances; she could not be woman without  such consciousness.  But it was as a girl that men looked at her, not as  an equal.  As well as personal experience and the lessons of eyes and  ears and intelligence, there were other things to classify and adjust;  things which were entirely from the outside of her own life.  The  fragments of common-room gossip, which it had been her fortune to hear  accidentally now and again.  The half confidences of scandals, borne on  whispered breaths.  The whole confidences of dormitory and study which  she had been privileged to share.  All were parts of the new and strange  world, the great world which had swum into her ken.    As she sat now in the train, with some formulation of memory already  accomplished in the two hours of solitude, her first comment, spoken half  audibly, would have surprised her teachers as much as it would have  surprised herself, if she had been conscious of it; for as yet her  thinking was not self-conscious:    'Surely, I am not like that!'    It was of the women she had been thinking, not of the men.  The glimpse  which she had had of her own sex had been an awakening to her; and the  awakening had not been to a pleasant world.  All at once she seemed to  realise that her sex had defects--littlenesses, meannesses, cowardices,  falsenesses.  That their occupations were apt to be trivial or narrow or  selfish; that their desires were earthly, and their tastes coarse; that  what she held to be goodness was apt to be realised only as fear.  That  innocence was but ignorance, or at least baffled curiosity.  That . . .    A flood of shame swept over her, and instinctively she put her hands  before her burning face.  As usual, she was running all at once into  extremes.    And above all these was borne upon her, and for the first time in her  life, that she was herself a woman!    For a long time she sat quite still.  The train thrilled and roared on  its way.  Crowded stations took and gave their quantum of living freight;  but the young girl sat abstracted, unmoved, seemingly unconscious.  All  the dominance and energy of her nature were at work.    If, indeed, she was a woman, and had to abide by the exigencies of her  own sex, she would at least not be ruled and limited by woman's weakness.  She would plan and act and manage things for herself, in her own way.    Whatever her thoughts might be, she could at least control her acts.  And  those acts should be based not on woman's weakness, but on man's  strength!          CHAPTER VII--THE NEED OF KNOWING      When Stephen announced her intention of going with her father to the  Petty Sessions Court, there was consternation amongst the female  population of Normanstand and Norwood.  Such a thing had not been heard  of in the experiences of any of them.  Courts of Justice were places for  men; and the lower courts dealt with a class of cases . . . It was quite  impossible to imagine where any young lady could get such an idea . . .    Miss Laetitia Rowly recognised that she had a difficult task before her,  for she was by now accustomed to Stephen's quiet method of having her own  way.    She made a careful toilet before driving over to Normanstand.  Her  wearing her best bonnet was a circumstance not unattended with dread for  some one.  Behold her then, sailing into the great drawing-room at  Normanstand with her mind so firmly fixed on the task before her as to be  oblivious of minor considerations.  She was so fond of Stephen, and  admired so truly her many beauties and fine qualities, that she was  secure and without flaw in her purpose.  Stephen was in danger, and  though she doubted if she would be able to effect any change, she was  determined that at least she should not go into danger with her eyes  unopened.    Stephen entered hastily and ran to her.  She loved her great-aunt; really  and truly loved her.  And indeed it would have been strange if she had  not, for from the earliest hour which she could recollect she had  received from her nothing but the truest, fondest affection.  Moreover  she deeply respected the old lady, her truth, her resolution, her  kindliness, her genuine common-sense ability.  Stephen always felt safe  with her aunt.  In the presence of others she might now and again have a  qualm or a doubt; but not with her.  There was an abiding calm in her  love, answering love realised and respected.  Her long and intimate  knowledge of Laetitia made her aware of her moods.  She could read the  signs of them.  She knew well the meaning of the bonnet which actually  seemed to quiver as though it had a sentience of its own.  She knew well  the cause of her aunt's perturbation; the pain which must be caused to  her was perhaps the point of most resistance in herself--she having made  up her mind to her new experience.  All she could do would be to try to  reconcile her by the assurance of good intention; by reason, and by  sweetness of manner.  When she had kissed her and sat beside her, holding  her hand after her pretty way, she, seeing the elder woman somewhat at a  loss, opened the subject herself:    'You look troubled, auntie!  I hope it is nothing serious?'    'It is, my dear!  Very serious!  Everything is serious to me which  touches you.'    'Me, Auntie!'  Hypocrisy is a fine art.    'Yes! yes, Stephen.  Oh! my dear child, what is this I hear about your  going to Petty Sessions with your father?'    'Oh, that!  Why, Auntie dear, you must not let that trouble you.  It is  all right.  That is necessary!'    'Necessary!' the old lady's figure grew rigid and her voice was loud and  high.  'Necessary for a young lady to go to a court house.  To hear low  people speaking of low crimes.  To listen to cases of the most shocking  kind; cases of low immorality; cases of a kind, of a nature of a--a--class  that you are not supposed to know anything about.  Really, Stephen! . . .  '  She was drawing away her hand in indignation.  But Stephen held it  tight, as she said very sweetly:    'That is just it, Auntie.  I am so ignorant that I feel I should know  more of the lives of those very people!'  Miss Laetitia interrupted:    'Ignorant!  Of course you are ignorant.  That is what you ought to be.  Isn't it what we have all been devoting ourselves to effect ever since  you were born?  Read your third chapter of Genesis and remember what came  of eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.'    'I think the Tree of Knowledge must have been an orange tree.'  The old  lady looked up, her interest aroused:    'Why?'    'Because ever since Eden other brides have worn its blossom!'  Her tone  was demure.  Miss Rowly looked sharply at her, but her sharpness softened  off into a smile.    'H'm!' she said, and was silent.  Stephen seized the opportunity to put  her own case:    'Auntie dear, you must forgive me!  You really must, for my heart is set  on this.  I assure you I am not doing it merely to please myself.  I have  thought over the whole matter.  Father has always wished me to be in a  position--a position of knowledge and experience--to manage Normanstand  if I should ever succeed him.  From the earliest time I can remember he  has always kept this before me, and though of course I did not at first  understand what it meant, I have seemed in the last few years to know  better.  Accordingly I learned all sorts of things under his care, and  sometimes even without his help.  I have studied the estate map, and I  have been over the estate books and read some of the leases and all such  matters which they deal with in the estate office.  This only told me the  bones of the thing.  I wanted to know more of our people; and so I made a  point of going now and again to each house that we own.  Of seeing the  people and talking with them familiarly; as familiarly as they would let  me, and indeed so far as was possible considering my position.  For,  Auntie dear, I soon began to learn--to learn in a way there was no  mistaking--what my position is.  And so I want to get to know more of  their ordinary lives; the darker as well as the lighter side.  I would  like to do them good.  I can see how my dear daddy has always been a sort  of power to help them, and I would like to carry on his work; to carry it  further if I may.  But I must know.'    Her aunt had been listening with growing interest, and with growing  respect too, for she realised the intense earnestness which lay behind  the girl's words and her immediate purpose.  Her voice and manner were  both softened:    'But, my dear, surely it is not necessary to go into the Court to know  these things.  The results of each case become known.'    'That is just it, Auntie,' she answered quickly.  'The magistrates have  to hear the two sides of the case before even "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2526"],[0,"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: The Book of the Spiritual Man (#9)"],[1,"and free exercise of his powers. The spiritual  powers, therefore, are the powers of the grown and liberated spiritual  man. They can only be developed and used as the spiritual man grows  and attains liberation through obedience. This is the first thing to be  kept in mind, in all that is said of spiritual powers in the third and  fourth books of the Sutras. The second thing to be understood and  kept in mind is this:    Just as our modern sages have discerned and taught that all matter is  ultimately one and eternal, definitely related throughout the whole  wide universe; just as they have discerned and taught that all force is  one and eternal, so coordinated throughout the whole universe that  whatever affects any atom measurably affects the whole boundless  realm of matter and force, to the most distant star or nebula on the  dim confines of space; so the ancient sages had discerned and taught  that all consciousness is one, immortal, indivisible, infinite; so finely  correlated and continuous that whatever is perceived by any  consciousness is, whether actually or potentially, within the reach of  all consciousness, and therefore within the reach of any consciousness.  This has been well expressed by saying that all souls are fundamentally  one with the Oversoul; that the Son of God, and all Sons of God, are  fundamentally one with the Father. When the consciousness is cleared  of psychic bonds and veils, when the spiritual man is able to stand, to  see, then this superb law comes into effect: whatever is within the  knowledge of any consciousness, and this includes the whole infinite  universe, is within his reach, and may, if he wills, be made a part of his  consciousness. This he may attain through his fundamental unity with  the Oversoul, by raising himself toward the consciousness above him,  and drawing on its resources. The Son, if he would work miracles,  whether of perception or of action, must come often into the presence  of the Father. This is the birthright of the spiritual man; through it he  comes into possession of his splendid and immortal powers. Let it be  clearly kept in mind that what is here to be related of the spiritual man,  and his exalted powers, must in no wise be detached from what has  gone before. The being, the very inception, of the spiritual man  depends on the purification and moral attainment already detailed, and  can in no wise dispense with these or curtail them.    Let no one imagine that the true life, the true powers of the spiritual  man, can be attained by any way except the hard way of sacrifice, of  trial, of renunciation, of selfless self-conquest and genuine devotion to  the weal of all others. Only thus can the golden gates be reached and  entered. Only thus can we attain to that pure world wherein the  spiritual man lives, and moves, and has his being. Nothing impure,  nothing unholy can ever cross that threshold, least of all impure  motives or self seeking desires. These must be burnt away before an  entrance to that world can be gained.    But where there is light, there is shadow; and the lofty light of the soul  casts upon the clouds of the mid-world the shadow of the spiritual  man and of his powers; the bastard vesture and the bastard powers of  psychism are easily attained; yet, even when attained, they are a  delusion, the very essence of unreality.    Therefore ponder well the earlier rules, and lay a firm foundation of  courage, sacrifice, selflessness, holiness.        BOOK III    1. The binding of the perceiving consciousness to a certain region is  attention (dharana).    Emerson quotes Sir Isaac Newton as saying that he made his great  discoveries by intending his mind on them. That is what is meant here.  I read the page of a book while inking of something else. At the end  of he page, I have no idea of what it is about, and read it again, still  thinking of something else, with the same result. Then I wake up, so  to speak, make an effort of attention, fix my thought on what I am  reading, and easily take in its meaning. The act of will, the effort of  attention, the intending of the mind on each word and line of the page,  just as the eyes are focussed on each word and line, is the power here  contemplated. It is the power to focus the consciousness on a given  spot, and hold it there Attention is the first and indispensable step in  all knowledge. Attention to spiritual things is the first step to  spiritual knowledge.    2. A prolonged holding of the perceiving consciousness in that region  is meditation (dhyana).    This will apply equally to outer and inner things. I may for a moment  fix my attention on some visible object, in a single penetrating glance,  or I may hold the attention fixedly on it until it reveals far more of its  nature than a single glance could perceive. The first is the focussing  of the searchlight of consciousness upon the object. The other is the  holding of the white beam of light steadily and persistently on the  object, until it yields up the secret of its details. So for things within;  one may fix the inner glance for a moment on spiritual things, or one  may hold the consciousness steadily upon them, until what was in the  dark slowly comes forth into the light, and yields up its immortal  secret. But this is possible only for the spiritual man, after the  Commandments and the Rules have been kept; for until this is done,  the thronging storms of psychical thoughts dissipate and distract the  attention, so that it will not remain fixed on spiritual things. The cares  of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word of the  spiritual message.    3. When the perceiving consciousness in this meditative is wholly  given to illuminating the essential meaning of the object contemplated,  and is freed from the sense of separateness and personality, this is  contemplation (samadhi).    Let us review the steps so far taken. First, the beam of perceiving  consciousness is focussed on a certain region or subject, through the  effort of attention. Then this attending consciousness is held on its  object. Third, there is the ardent will to know its meaning, to illumine  it with comprehending thought. Fourth, all personal bias--all desire  merely to indorse a previous opinion and so prove oneself right, and  all desire for personal profit or gratification must be quite put away.  There must be a purely disinterested love of truth for its own sake.  Thus is the perceiving consciousness made void, as it were, of all  personality or sense of separateness. The personal limitation stands  aside and lets the All-consciousness come to bear upon the problem.  The Oversoul bends its ray upon the object, and illumines it with pure  light.    4. When these three, Attention, Meditation Contemplation, are  exercised at once, this is perfectly concentrated Meditation (sanyama).    When the personal limitation of the perceiving consciousness stands  aside, and allows the All-conscious to come to bear upon the problem,  then arises that real knowledge which is called a flash of genius; that  real knowledge which makes discoveries, and without which no  discovery can be made, however painstaking the effort. For genius is  the vision of the spiritual man, and that vision is a question of growth  rather than present effort; though right effort, rightly continued, will  in time infallibly lead to growth and vision. Through the power thus  to set aside personal limitation, to push aside petty concerns and  cares, and steady the whole nature and will in an ardent love of truth  and desire to know it; through the power thus to make way for the  All-consciousness, all great men make their discoveries. Newton,  watching the apple fall to the earth, was able to look beyond, to see  the subtle waves of force pulsating through apples and worlds and  suns and galaxies, and thus to perceive universal gravitation. The  Oversoul, looking through his eyes, recognized the universal force,  one of its own children. Darwin, watching the forms and motions of  plants and animals, let the same august consciousness come to bear on  them, and saw infinite growth perfected through ceaseless struggle.  He perceived the superb process of evolution, the Oversoul once more  recognizing its own. Fraunhofer, noting the dark lines in the band of  sunlight in his spectroscope, divined their identity with the bright lines  in the spectra of incandescent iron, sodium and the rest, and so saw  the oneness of substance in the worlds and suns, the unity of the  materials of the universe. Once again the Oversoul, looking with his  eyes, recognized its own. So it is with all true knowledge. But the  mind must transcend its limitations, its idiosyncrasies; there must be  purity, for to the pure in heart is the promise, that they shall see God.    5. By mastering this perfectly concentrated Meditation, there comes  the illumination of perception. The meaning of this is illustrated by  what has been said before. When the spiritual man is able to throw  aside the trammels of emotional and mental limitation, and to open his  eyes, he sees clearly, he attains to illuminated perception. A poet once  said that Occultism is the conscious cultivation of genius; and it is  certain that the awakened spiritual man attains to the perceptions of  genius. Genius is the vision, the power, of the spiritual man, whether  its possessor recognizes this or not. All true knowledge is of the  spiritual man. The greatest in all ages have recognized this and put  their testimony on record. The great in wisdom who have not  consciously recognized it, have ever been full of the spirit of  reverence, of selfless devotion to truth, of humility, as was Darwin;  and reverence and humility are the unconscious recognition of the  nearness of the Spirit, that Divinity which broods over us, a Master  o'er a slave.    6. This power is distributed in ascending degrees.    It is to be attained"]]]
