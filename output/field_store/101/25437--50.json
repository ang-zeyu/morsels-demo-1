He had trained around him a devoted band, who idolised his  genius and cherished his doctrines. His pupils had been appointed to  several of the principal professorships in Italy. The enemies of  religion were on this occasion united with the Christian philosopher;  and there were, even in these days, many princes and nobles who had felt  the inconvenience of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and who secretly  abetted Galileo in his crusade against established errors.    Although these two parties had been long dreading each others power, and  reconnoitring each others position, yet we cannot exactly determine  which of them hoisted the first signal for war. The church party,  particularly its highest dignitaries, were certainly disposed to rest on  the defensive. Flanked on one side by the logic of the schools, and on  the other by the popular interpretation of Scripture, and backed by the  strong arm of the civil power, they were not disposed to interfere with  the prosecution of science, however much they may have dreaded its  influence. The philosophers, on the contrary, united the zeal of  innovators with that firmness of purpose which truth alone can inspire.  Victorious in every contest, they were flushed with success, and they  panted for a struggle in which they knew they must triumph.    In this state of warlike preparation Galileo addressed a letter, in  1613, to his friend and pupil, the Abbe Castelli, the object of which  was to prove that the Scriptures were not intended to teach us science  and philosophy. Hence he inferred, that the language employed in the  sacred volume in reference to such subjects should be interpreted only  in its common acceptation; and that it was in reality as difficult to  reconcile the Ptolemaic as the Copernican system to the expressions  which occur in the Bible.    A demonstration was about this time made by the opposite party, in the  person of Caccini, a Dominican friar, who made a personal attack upon  Galileo from the pulpit. This violent ecclesiastic ridiculed the  astronomer and his followers, by addressing them sarcastically in the  sacred language of Scripture--\"Ye men of _Galilee_, why stand ye here  looking up into heaven?\" But this species of warfare was disapproved of  even by the church; and Luigi Maraffi, the general of the Dominicans,  not only apologised to Galileo, who had transmitted to him a formal  complaint against Caccini, but expressed the acuteness of his own  feelings on being implicated in the \"brutal conduct of thirty or forty  thousand monks.\"    From the character of Caccini, and the part which he afterwards played  in the persecution of Galileo, we can scarcely avoid the opinion that  his attack from the pulpit was intended as a snare for the unwary  philosopher. It roused Galileo from his wonted caution; and stimulated,  no doubt, by the nature of the answer which he received from Maraffi, he  published a long letter of seventy pages, defending and illustrating his  former views respecting the influence of scriptural language on the two  contending systems. As if to give the impress of royal authority to this  new appeal, he addressed it to Christian, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, the  mother of Cosmo; and in this form it seems to have excited a new  interest, as if it had expressed the opinion of the grand ducal family.  These external circumstances gave additional weight to the powerful and  unanswerable reasoning which this letter contains; and it was scarcely  possible that any man, possessed of a sound mind, and willing to learn  the truth, should refuse his assent to the judicious views of our  author. He expresses his belief that the Scriptures were designed to  instruct mankind respecting their salvation, and that the faculties of  our minds were given us for the purpose of investigating the phenomena  of nature. He considers Scripture and nature as proceeding from the same  divine author, and, therefore, incapable of speaking a different  language; and he points out the absurdity of supposing that professors  of astronomy will shut their eyes to the phenomena which they discover  in the heavens, or will refuse to believe those deductions of reason  which appeal to their judgment with all the power of demonstration. He  supports these views by quotations from the ancient fathers; and he  refers to the dedication of Copernicus's own work to the Roman Pontiff,  Paul III., as a proof that the Pope himself did not regard the new  system of the world as hostile to the sacred writings. Copernicus, on  the contrary, tells his Holiness, that the reason of inscribing to him  his new system was, that the authority of the Pontiff might put to  silence the calumnies of some individuals, who attacked it by arguments  drawn from passages of Scripture twisted for their own purpose.    It was in vain to meet such reasoning by any other weapons than those of  the civil power. The enemies of Galileo saw that they must either crush  the dangerous innovation, or allow it the fullest scope; and they  determined upon an appeal to the inquisition. Lorini, a monk of the  Dominican order, had already denounced to this body Galileo's letter to  Castelli; and Caccini, bribed by the mastership of the convent of St  Mary of Minerva, was invited to settle at Rome for the purpose of  embodying the evidence against Galileo.    Though these plans had been carried on in secret, yet Galileo's  suspicions were excited; and he obtained leave from Cosmo to go to Rome  about the end of 1615.[29] Here he was lodged in the palace of the  Grand Duke's ambassador, and kept up a constant correspondence with the  family of his patron at Florence; but, in the midst of this external  splendour, he was summoned before the inquisition to answer for the  heretical doctrines which he had published. He was charged with  maintaining the motion of the earth, and the stability of the sun--with  teaching this doctrine to his pupils--with corresponding on the subject  with several German mathematicians--and with having published it, and  attempted to reconcile it to Scripture, in his letters to Mark Velser in  1612. The inquisition assembled to consider these charges on the 25th of  February 1615; and it was decreed that Galileo should be enjoined by  Cardinal Bellarmine to renounce the obnoxious doctrines, and to pledge  himself that he would neither teach, defend, nor publish them in future.  In the event of his refusing to acquiesce in this sentence, it was  decreed that he should be thrown into prison. Galileo did not hesitate  to yield to this injunction. On the day following, the 26th of February,  he appeared before Cardinal Bellarmine, to renounce his heretical  opinions; and, having declared that he abandoned the doctrine of the  earth's motion, and would neither defend nor teach it, in his  conversation or in his writings, he was dismissed from the bar of the  inquisition.         [29] It is said that Galileo was cited to appear at Rome on this       occasion; and the opinion is not without foundation.    Having thus disposed of Galileo, the inquisition conceived the design of  condemning the whole system of Copernicus as heretical. Galileo, with  more hardihood than prudence, remained at Rome for the purpose of giving  his assistance in frustrating this plan; but there is reason to think  that he injured by his presence the very cause which he meant to  support. The inquisitors had determined to put down the new opinions;  and they now inserted among the prohibited books Galileo's letters to  Castelli and the Grand Duchess, Kepler's epitome of the Copernican  theory, and Copernicus's own work on the revolutions of the heavenly  bodies.    Notwithstanding these proceedings, Galileo had an audience of the Pope,  Paul V., in March 1616. He was received very graciously, and spent  nearly an hour with his Holiness. When they were about to part, the Pope  assured Galileo, that the congregation were not disposed to receive upon  light grounds any calumnies which might be propagated by his enemies,  and that, as long as he occupied the papal chair, he might consider  himself as safe.    These assurances were no doubt founded on the belief that Galileo would  adhere to his pledges; but so bold and inconsiderate was he in the  expression of his opinions, that even in Rome he was continually engaged  in controversial discussions. The following very interesting account of  these disputes is given by Querenghi, in a letter to the Cardinal  D'Este:--    \"Your eminence would be delighted with Galileo if you heard him holding  forth, as he often does, in the midst of fifteen or twenty, all  violently attacking him, sometimes in one house, sometimes in another.  But he is armed after such fashion that he laughs all of them to scorn;  and even if the novelty of his opinions prevents entire persuasion, he  at least convicts of emptiness most of the arguments with which his  adversaries endeavour to overwhelm him. He was particularly admirable on  Monday last in the house of Signor Frederico Ghisilieri; and what  especially pleased me was, that before replying to the contrary  arguments, he amplified and enforced them with new grounds of great  plausibility, so as to leave his adversaries in a more ridiculous  plight, when he afterwards overturned them all.\"    The discovery of Jupiter's satellites suggested to Galileo a new method  of finding the longitude at sea. Philip III. had encouraged astronomers  to direct their attention to this problem, by offering a reward for its  solution; and in those days, when new discoveries in science were  sometimes rejected as injurious to mankind, it was no common event to  see a powerful sovereign courting the assistance of astronomers in  promoting the commercial interests of his empire. Galileo seems to have  regarded the solution of this problem as an object worthy of his  ambition; and he no doubt anticipated the triumph"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26005"],[0,"Armour's Monthly Cook Book, Volume 2, No. 12, October 1913 (#9)"],[1,"otatoes, Angel Cake, Grape Nectar (Armour's       Grape Juice).
