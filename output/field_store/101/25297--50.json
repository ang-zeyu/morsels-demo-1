[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22288"],[0,"Chinese Painters: A Critical Study (#9)"],[1,"to the general evolution of Chinese painting from  the end of the thirteenth to the end of the fourteenth centuries. We must  now consider it more in detail, citing by way of illustration a few of the  painters who expressed the spirit of the time.    At its inception the Yuean dynasty had inherited the last masters of the  Sung period, among them two artists who are recognized as of the first  rank. Chao Meng-fu--known also under the appellation of Tzu[)u]-ang--was  born in 1254. He was a descendant of the first Sung emperor and held an  hereditary post which he resigned at the time the Yuean dynasty came into  power. He retired into private life until 1286, then when called back to  court as a high functionary, he became a supporter of the new dynasty.  Chao Meng-fu painted landscape as well as figures, flowers and the bamboo,  but he is most celebrated for his horses. Numberless paintings of  horses are attributed to this master; needless to say the great majority  of these are not by his hand.      [Illustration: PLATE XVI. PORTRAIT OF A PRIEST    Yuean or Early Ming Period. Collection of H. Riviere.]    As a landscape painter he seems to have worked in the style of the  Southern School, with a fine, simple line in which may still be seen  traces of the ancient tradition that extends back to Ku K'ai-chih. This  characteristic line is found in the paintings of men and horses where the  hand of Chao Meng-fu is distinguishable. He bequeaths it to the large  school which he founded, and, through his pupils, it becomes the  inheritance of his imitators in the Ming period. It is more than probable  that almost all of the paintings by his pupils, bearing the signature  Tz[)u]-ang, are attributed to the master, while his own paintings are  ascribed to Han Kan, painter of horses in the T'ang period. However, among  the numerous works attributed to Chao Meng-fu, there are a few in which we  recognize the vibrant and flexible line which is seen in his landscapes.  These paintings bear the signature of Tz[)u]-ang, in all probability a  false one, but the work of art itself will always be of greater value in  determining its authenticity than the most impressive of inscriptions. If  the technique and the quality of the line are sufficiently similar to  warrant attributing to the same hand the landscape in the British Museum,  and any particular painting of horses, this may be regarded as sufficient  evidence on which to base our own opinion as to his style.    Amongst his grooms and mounted soldiers, Chao Meng-fu painted the  different races which the wave of Mongolian invasion had swept into China:  Chinese from the central provinces, Tartars, Mongols with fur caps,  Moslems of a Semitic type from Turkestan, with white turbans and heavy  earrings. Whether his subject was the little Tartar horse from the  Mongolian plains or the beautiful steeds of ancient Transoxiana, always  brought as tribute by way of Khotan to the Chinese court, he gave the life  of the horse a singular beauty, portraying him in an equally happy manner  whether in the act of racing or in the attitudes of repose. In his mind  still dwelt the vision of Sung ideals, which proclaimed the hidden soul of  things and valued spirituality and life in a painting. Although we see  marked evidence of the Southern style in his work, his paintings are more  strongly colored than are those of that school. The influence of the Yuean  period begins to make itself felt. It brings out values in colored  pigment, emphasizes its violence and paves the way for a new tradition.    Chao Meng-fu has been compared by Chinese critics to his great predecessor  Han Kan. The writings, however, are unanimous in stating that,  notwithstanding his undeniable mastery, he lacked something of the vigor  of the earlier master. When we attempt to compare the two styles through  the aid of paintings of the T'ang period, wherein a reflection of the  great animal painter may be sought, the writings appear to be confirmed  in attributing a more positive and forceful character to the work of Han  Kan or the unknown group of painters around him. But Chao Meng-fu seems to  have possessed in a higher degree the feeling of movement and life, and to  have been less hampered in his choice of poses. Centuries of study and of  observation had intervened between the great animal painter of the T'ang  epoch and his worthy rival of a later period.      [Illustration: PLATE XVII. HORSE    Painting by an unknown artist. Yuean or Early Ming Period.    Doucet Collection.]    Like Chao Meng-fu, Ch'ien Hsuean, or Ch'ien Shun-chue, retired from public  life at the downfall of the Sung dynasty. He was a member of a group of  the faithful over which Chao presided, but, more decided than the latter  in his opposition to the new dynasty, he was indignant at his confrere's  defection and refused to follow his example. He lived in retirement,  devoting himself to painting and to poetry up to the time of his death. He  also continued the Sung tradition under the Yuean dynasty to which, as a  matter of fact, he belonged only during the second part of his life. He  painted figures, landscape, flowers and birds. His delicate line is not  lacking in strength, and he seems to have been especially endowed with a  sense of form which approached greatness in its simplicity. Whether the  subject is a young prince or a pigeon perched on the summit of a rock from  which chrysanthemums are springing, the same dignified and tranquil  nobility is asserted with ease. He still used the quiet and restrained  coloring of the Sung period and prolonged, without impairing it, the  great tradition that a century and a half could not quite efface.    Of Yen Hui we know almost nothing; the books state briefly that he painted  Buddhist figures, birds and flowers, and that he was past master in the  painting of demons. Nothing is known of the date of his birth or if, by  his age and training, he could be classed in the Sung period, but several  admirable paintings by him are extant which serve to show how Sung art was  still interpreted by exceptional masters in the Yuean period. His line is  strong, broader, fuller and more abrupt than that of Chao Meng-fu or  Ch'ien Shun-chue. The quivering vitality that emanates from his pictures is  thrilling. Whether the subject is a peony heavy with dew, whose drooping  petals presage the approaching end, or a Buddhist monk patching his  mantle, the fleeting moment is seized with such intuitive power that  prolonged contemplation of the painting creates the impression that it is  suddenly about to come to life. There is something sturdier, more  startling, less dreamy in these great painters who continue the traditions  of Sung art; their work alone demonstrated that tradition could be revived  and that ancient China, under the Mongolian dynasty, was still preserving  its creative spirit and advancing resolutely into fertile fields.    In Huang Kung-wang and Ni Tsan, we approach a different order of things.  Lines began to take on a classical character, to be divided into a  series of different types, which painters adopted according to their  temperament and requirements, and finally became impersonal and academic.  Both of these painters, nevertheless, were under the spell of early  influences extending back to the T'ang artists. Through study of these old  masters they returned to the use of a full and sometimes vivid color, but  kept a profound love of nature, and a fresh and original vision, by which  they still perpetuated the inspiration of Sung painting in a new form.  With these painters, however, new features appeared. Reds and purples  became dominant notes amidst rich greens which set them off and enhanced  their brilliancy. The vision of landscape itself is somewhat more  realistic and less subtle. In all of these essentials Ni Tsan, who died in  1374, brings us nearer to the Ming period.      [Illustration: PLATE XVIII. VISIT TO THE EMPEROR BY THE IMMORTALS FROM    ON HIGH Ming Period. British Museum, London.]    Simultaneously, though quite apart, marked tendencies of a different  character were evident. The old masters of the T'ang period had again  returned to favor. The vivid illumination and color distinct from drawing,  in these firm and vigorous works appealed to the untutored barbarian. On  the other hand, the studies of the Sung period had not been fruitless;  therefore when, under these influences, the use of color was resumed, the  painters profited by what the practice of monochrome had taught meanwhile.  In the Yuean period appear those paintings which are attacked directly with  a dripping brush without preliminary drawing, the forms being modeled in  the color itself. The Chinese called this painting \"without bones,\" in  other words, deprived of the assistance of line. This procedure was first  used by a painter of the Sung period, but it did not take root definitely  until the time when the practice of using Chinese ink as a medium to  express tones had taught painters how to model forms in color itself,  making the structure depend upon color.    Seen as a whole, the Yuean period witnessed the assembling, the  concentration, so to speak, of the ardent but scattered inspirations of  the great masters of the preceding school. It produced splendid  compositions in which the golden age of Chinese painting continued to be  manifest. Masters arose and if, in spite of all, they mark a reaction  toward the Northern style, seeking rich and vivid color, they give us a  vision of beauty that is equal to the work of their predecessors.    Meanwhile grave signs of decadence were apparent. Composition became  overladen and complex and began to lose something of the noble simplicity,  greatness and supreme charm of the old masters. It was evident that the  Yuean painters were working under the eye of the barbarians. They yielded  to the taste of the latter for anecdote, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/223"],[0,"The Wisdom of Father Brown (#9)"],[1,"explain.  He refers me to two strangers in a cafe as to two flunkeys. He has  thrown me out of the house, but I am going back into it, with the people  of Paris behind me!\"    A shout seemed to shake the very facade of mansions and two stones flew,  one breaking a window above the balcony. The indignant Colonel plunged  once more under the archway and was heard crying and thundering inside.  Every instant the human sea grew wider and wider; it surged up against  the rails and steps of the traitor's house; it was already certain that  the place would be burst into like the Bastille, when the broken french  window opened and Dr Hirsch came out on the balcony. For an instant  the fury half turned to laughter; for he was an absurd figure in such  a scene. His long bare neck and sloping shoulders were the shape of a  champagne bottle, but that was the only festive thing about him. His  coat hung on him as on a peg; he wore his carrot-coloured hair long  and weedy; his cheeks and chin were fully fringed with one of those  irritating beards that begin far from the mouth. He was very pale, and  he wore blue spectacles.    Livid as he was, he spoke with a sort of prim decision, so that the mob  fell silent in the middle of his third sentence.    \"...only two things to say to you now. The first is to my foes, the  second to my friends. To my foes I say: It is true I will not meet M.  Dubosc, though he is storming outside this very room. It is true I have  asked two other men to confront him for me. And I will tell you why!  Because I will not and must not see him--because it would be against all  rules of dignity and honour to see him. Before I am triumphantly cleared  before a court, there is another arbitration this gentleman owes me as a  gentleman, and in referring him to my seconds I am strictly--\"    Armagnac and Brun were waving their hats wildly, and even the Doctor's  enemies roared applause at this unexpected defiance. Once more a few  sentences were inaudible, but they could hear him say: \"To my friends--I  myself should always prefer weapons purely intellectual, and to these  an evolved humanity will certainly confine itself. But our own most  precious truth is the fundamental force of matter and heredity. My books  are successful; my theories are unrefuted; but I suffer in politics  from a prejudice almost physical in the French. I cannot speak like  Clemenceau and Deroulede, for their words are like echoes of their  pistols. The French ask for a duellist as the English ask for a  sportsman. Well, I give my proofs: I will pay this barbaric bribe, and  then go back to reason for the rest of my life.\"    Two men were instantly found in the crowd itself to offer their services  to Colonel Dubosc, who came out presently, satisfied. One was the common  soldier with the coffee, who said simply: \"I will act for you, sir. I  am the Duc de Valognes.\" The other was the big man, whom his friend the  priest sought at first to dissuade; and then walked away alone.    In the early evening a light dinner was spread at the back of the Cafe  Charlemagne. Though unroofed by any glass or gilt plaster, the guests  were nearly all under a delicate and irregular roof of leaves; for the  ornamental trees stood so thick around and among the tables as to give  something of the dimness and the dazzle of a small orchard. At one of  the central tables a very stumpy little priest sat in complete solitude,  and applied himself to a pile of whitebait with the gravest sort of  enjoyment. His daily living being very plain, he had a peculiar taste  for sudden and isolated luxuries; he was an abstemious epicure. He did  not lift his eyes from his plate, round which red pepper, lemons, brown  bread and butter, etc., were rigidly ranked, until a tall shadow fell  across the table, and his friend Flambeau sat down opposite. Flambeau  was gloomy.    \"I'm afraid I must chuck this business,\" said he heavily. \"I'm all on  the side of the French soldiers like Dubosc, and I'm all against the  French atheists like Hirsch; but it seems to me in this case we've made  a mistake. The Duke and I thought it as well to investigate the charge,  and I must say I'm glad we did.\"    \"Is the paper a forgery, then?\" asked the priest    \"That's just the odd thing,\" replied Flambeau. \"It's exactly like  Hirsch's writing, and nobody can point out any mistake in it. But it  wasn't written by Hirsch. If he's a French patriot he didn't write it,  because it gives information to Germany. And if he's a German spy he  didn't write it, well--because it doesn't give information to Germany.\"    \"You mean the information is wrong?\" asked Father Brown.    \"Wrong,\" replied the other, \"and wrong exactly where Dr Hirsch would  have been right--about the hiding-place of his own secret formula in his  own official department. By favour of Hirsch and the authorities, the  Duke and I have actually been allowed to inspect the secret drawer at  the War Office where the Hirsch formula is kept. We are the only people  who have ever known it, except the inventor himself and the Minister for  War; but the Minister permitted it to save Hirsch from fighting. After  that we really can't support Dubosc if his revelation is a mare's nest.\"    \"And it is?\" asked Father Brown.    \"It is,\" said his friend gloomily. \"It is a clumsy forgery by somebody  who knew nothing of the real hiding-place. It says the paper is in the  cupboard on the right of the Secretary's desk. As a fact the cupboard  with the secret drawer is some way to the left of the desk. It says  the grey envelope contains a long document written in red ink. It isn't  written in red ink, but in ordinary black ink. It's manifestly absurd to  say that Hirsch can have made a mistake about a paper that nobody knew  of but himself; or can have tried to help a foreign thief by telling him  to fumble in the wrong drawer. I think we must chuck it up and apologize  to old Carrots.\"    Father Brown seemed to cogitate; he lifted a little whitebait on his  fork. \"You are sure the grey envelope was in the left cupboard?\" he  asked.    \"Positive,\" replied Flambeau. \"The grey envelope--it was a white  envelope really--was--\"    Father Brown put down the small silver fish and the fork and stared  across at his companion. \"What?\" he asked, in an altered voice.    \"Well, what?\" repeated Flambeau, eating heartily.    \"It was not grey,\" said the priest. \"Flambeau, you frighten me.\"    \"What the deuce are you frightened of?\"    \"I'm frightened of a white envelope,\" said the other seriously, \"If it  had only just been grey! Hang it all, it might as well have been grey.  But if it was white, the whole business is black. The Doctor has been  dabbling in some of the old brimstone after all.\"    \"But I tell you he couldn't have written such a note!\" cried Flambeau.  \"The note is utterly wrong about the facts. And innocent or guilty, Dr  Hirsch knew all about the facts.\"    \"The man who wrote that note knew all about the facts,\" said his  clerical companion soberly. \"He could never have got 'em so wrong  without knowing about 'em. You have to know an awful lot to be wrong on  every subject--like the devil.\"    \"Do you mean--?\"    \"I mean a man telling lies on chance would have told some of the truth,\"  said his friend firmly. \"Suppose someone sent you to find a house with  a green door and a blue blind, with a front garden but no back garden,  with a dog but no cat, and where they drank coffee but not tea. You  would say if you found no such house that it was all made up. But I say  no. I say if you found a house where the door was blue and the blind  green, where there was a back garden and no front garden, where cats  were common and dogs instantly shot, where tea was drunk in quarts and  coffee forbidden--then you would know you had found the house. The man  must have known that particular house to be so accurately inaccurate.\"    \"But what could it mean?\" demanded the diner opposite.    \"I can't conceive,\" said Brown; \"I don't understand this Hirsch affair  at all. As long as it was only the left drawer instead of the right, and  red ink instead of black, I thought it must be the chance blunders of a  forger, as you say. But three is a mystical number; it finishes things.  It finishes this. That the direction about the drawer, the colour of  ink, the colour of envelope, should none of them be right by accident,  that can't be a coincidence. It wasn't.\"    \"What was it, then? Treason?\" asked Flambeau, resuming his dinner.    \"I don't know that either,\" answered Brown, with a face of blank  bewilderment. \"The only thing I can think of.... Well, I never  understood that Dreyfus case. I can always grasp moral evidence easier  than the other sorts. I go by a man's eyes and voice, don't you know,  and whether his family seems happy, and by what subjects he chooses--and  avoids. Well, I was puzzled in the Dreyfus case. Not by the horrible  things imputed both ways; I know (though it's not modern to say so) that  human nature in the highest places is still capable of being Cenci or  Borgia. No--, what puzzled me was the sincerity of both parties. I don't  mean the political parties; the rank and file are always roughly  honest, and often duped. I mean the persons of the play. I mean the  conspirators, if they were conspirators. I mean the traitor, if he was a  traitor. I mean the men who must have known the truth. Now Dreyfus  went on like a man who knew he was a wronged man. And yet the French  statesmen and soldiers went on as if they knew he wasn't a wronged man  but simply a wrong 'un. I don't mean they behaved well; I mean they  behaved as if they were sure. I can't describe these things; I know what  I mean.\"    \"I wish I did,\" said his friend. \"And what has it to do with old  Hirsch?\"    \"Suppose a person in a position of trust,\" went on the priest, \"began to  give the enemy information because it was false information. Suppose  he even thought he was"]]]
