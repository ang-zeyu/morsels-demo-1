Milman (p. 202) adds that the  hearers pulled the doll to pieces. The dean is made to say \"Ridley,  now bishop of Rochester\"; but Ridley was bishop 1547-1550, as Milman  elsewhere implies (p. 211).    [26] Milman, p. 216.    [27] My authorities for this well-nigh incredible story are in \"St.  Paul's and Old City Life,\" p. 234.    [28] \"Plot\" I must continue to call it, with all due deference to  certain modern apologists.    [29] Horace Walpole (quoted in Longman, p. 69) says that Inigo Jones  renewed the sides with \"very bad Gothic.\" Assuming the accuracy of the  prints in Dugdale, it is difficult to see where the Gothic comes in.    [30] Carlyle's \"Cromwell,\" vol i., chap. iv.    [31] There is some confusion as to receipts and expenditure. I take  Dugdale to mean that under the Charles commission L101,000 was raised,  and L35,000 spent; but it seems uncertain whether we are to include  Sir Paul Pindar's liberality in this sum. Dean Milman estimates that  only L17,000 was confiscated. The enormous cost of the army caused a  chronic deficit.    [32] \"Cromwell,\" vol ii., part v.: The Levellers.    [33] Ibid. Friday, April 27, 1649.    [34] \"Gleanings,\" p. 283.    [35] \"Old St. Paul's,\" chap. v. I have found no corroboration for this  interesting incident related by Ainsworth in detail.    [36] Yet the vacant space was in many places very narrow, and the  bishop's palace was actually connected with the south-east end of the  cathedral.    [37] My quotations from Taswell and Evelyn are taken from Milman,  chap. xv. I cannot explain Taswell's mention of lightning. Some assert  that St. Paul's caught fire on the Monday.          CHAPTER III.    OLD ST. PAUL'S--EXTERIOR.      The church was cruciform, with aisles to every arm; and we will give  the external dimensions before the fire of 1561, which include the  lofty spire and exclude the portico. The figures must in all cases be  considered approximate.    The extreme length east and west is difficult to ascertain:  authorities do not agree; neither do their different estimates with  their scales. Mr. William Longman, upon the authority of Mr. E.B.  Ferrey, estimates it at 596 feet, and his accompanying scale even  more. If the accuracy of the comparative ground-plan in \"St. Paul's  and Old City Life\" can be depended upon, we must put it at a little  over 580 feet; but Mr. F.C. Penrose's invaluable excavations do not  appear to have fixed the precise termination of the west front. Mr.  Longman also gives a comparative ground-plan of the two cathedrals  from a drawing of Wren's (see below, p. 64); and this, though on a  small scale, is perhaps our safest guide, and we shall probably not be  far wrong if we say 580 feet or a little over, and divide our length  as follows: nave, 252 feet; across transept, 104 feet; choir, 224  feet. To this must be added the portico of 40 feet, making a total  length of at least 620 feet. The old west end was some 70 feet nearer  Ludgate Hill, and with the portico 110 feet nearer. Length of  transepts, 293 feet, the two arms being equal; breadth of both nave  and transepts, 104 feet, Dugdale's scale making them exactly 100 feet:  breadth of choir a trifle less. Height of nave from ground to apex of  roof, about 130 feet, and of choir, 143 feet. Height of central tower  by Wren's estimate, the lowest, 260 feet, and of spire about 200  feet; altogether according to Wren, 460 feet, and according to others  still higher. Height of western towers with the spires I take the  liberty of adding, unknown. I have calculated the area at about 81,000  to 82,000 square feet; and in this have excluded St. Gregory's (say 93  X 23 feet plus the apse) and the Chapter House, with the surrounding  cloister; a square of 90 feet and more than half covered in. These two  members were structurally part and parcel of the building.    Thus we see that Old St. Paul's was by far the largest cathedral  church in England. Its area exceeded York and Durham: its length  Winchester: the height of its graceful lead-covered spire exceeded  Salisbury; and this, taking Wren's safe and low estimate, and not  counting ball, cross and eagle weathercock of some thirty feet more.  If we allow St. Gregory and the covered part of the Chapter House  area, as we should, it equalled in area or slightly exceeded alike its  successor and Cologne and Florence, and was surpassed only by the new  St. Peter's, Milan, and Seville. \"See the bigness,\" said Bishop Corbet  of Norwich, \"and your eye never yet beheld such a goodly object.\"    The difficulties which present themselves in any attempt to describe  the architecture still continue to beset us; such earlier drawings as  we have are contradictory and rude to a degree.[38] The NAVE  was Norman, rebuilt to a great extent after the fire of 1137. The  aisles had the usual round-headed windows, with the unusual (for  England) circular windows above. There were flat buttresses; but I  must reject the flying-buttresses of some restorers. The clerestory  windows are a puzzle. Everybody maintains they were Pointed, and, if  so, they would have been inserted at the same time as the new roof;  but there seems to be no trustworthy authority for this. In Finden's  engravings after Hollar they are taken at a peculiar angle which is  apt to mislead. Hollar and his engravers give two windows on the south  side in the interior, _i.e._, of the nave and clerestory. Both seem  alike; and Inigo Jones' patched-up north and south fronts represent  them both as round, so that the balance of evidence appears to be in  favour of round.[39]    Another difficulty is the question of the existence or nonexistence  of the western towers. Mr. William Longman and Mr. E.B. Ferrey give  none in their south-west view, because \"no drawings or plates are  known to exist which would settle the question.\" But it is our  misfortune that we have to reconstruct Old St. Paul's practically  without the help of drawings, until we come to Inigo Jones' finished  work. In Dugdale's ground-plan they cover almost exactly the same area  as one of the severies of the neighbouring aisles, and are flush with  the west front; in both respects resembling those of Wells and other  cathedrals. Besides, they are constantly mentioned, and at various  dates, as Mr. Longman duly acknowledges. The southern tower was the  original LOLLARDS' TOWER from which the Lambeth tower has  borrowed its name, and was utilised for a prison by the Bishops of  London for ecclesiastical offences. It was both bell and clock tower,  and abutted on to both the cathedral proper and St. Gregory's. So late  as 1573, Peter Burchet of the Middle Temple, shortly afterwards  executed for murdering his gaoler in the tower, was imprisoned here  for heresy, and would then have been sentenced to death but for  recanting.    The north-west tower was likewise used at times as a prison, and was  connected with the bishop's palace. In the days of Bonner, an upper  floor almost as high as the parapet of the nave contained a room eight  feet by thirteen; and the two towers were connected by a passage in the  thickness of the west wall. Hollar's views show us that Inigo Jones  overlaid these towers with a new coating, and finished them off with  turrets. The original towers were probably crowned with spires of wood  and lead, and both projected some thirty feet from the aisles. The high  roof of the nave[40] of the middle of the thirteenth century had an  angle of about forty-five, and replaced an older one during the  rebuilding of the choir. The CENTRAL TOWER had double flying-buttresses  with pinnacles springing from the clerestory; and, assuming that the  west towers had also spires, the grouping must have been nearly  perfect.    Yet another puzzle is the architecture of the TRANSEPTS. The  north and south windows at the ends are sometimes represented as of a  late date, but not by Hollar. They were probably Norman in their three  stages. In his report[41] Wren says, \"The North and South Wings have  Aisles only on the West side, the others being originally shut up for  the 'Consistory.'\" What he meant was that the two east aisles were  shut off from the rest of the transepts. Their architecture (of the  same dimensions as their western counterparts) was Geometrical as  regards windows, buttresses, and pinnacles. The rest of the transepts  resembled the nave; and this part of the south front was very much  broken. The cloister and chapter house occupied almost the whole of  the west side of the south transept, and four bays of the nave; St.  Gregory's Church occupied four more bays at the west of the nave,  leaving only three aisle windows of the nave on the south side.    Taking the CHOIR next, we will at once dismiss as  untrustworthy the view taken in 1610 in Speed, as reproduced in \"St.  Paul's Cathedral and Old City Life.\" Here the windows are represented  as Norman; but this is not the first time I have found Speed at fault.  We have records of the consecration of the western part in 1240, and  of the pulling down of St. Faith's and of the completion of the  eastern part by the end of the century, or, counting certain  additions, a little later. The western and earlier part extended to  the fourth window, which is broader than the rest; and the mouldings  were somewhat different in this part; but still the matter is not  without difficulty. The engravings represent the whole of the tracery  of the twelve windows on either side as Geometrical.

The light that flies  through Space at a velocity of 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per  second, takes thirty-six years and a half to reach us from this distant  sun: _i.e._, the luminous ray we are now receiving from Polaris has been  traveling for more than the third of a century. When you, gentle reader,  were born, the ray that arrives to-day from the Pole-Star was already  speeding on its way. In the first second after it had started it  traveled 300,000 kilometers; in the second it added another 300,000  which at once makes 600,000 kilometers; add another 300,000 kilometers  for the third second, and so on during the thirty-six years and a half.    If we tried to arrange the number 300,000 (which represents the distance  accomplished in one second) in superposed rows, as if for an addition  sum, as many times as is necessary to obtain the distance that  separates the Pole-Star from our Earth, the necessary operation would  comprise 1,151,064,000 rows, and the sheet of paper required for the  setting out of such a sum would measure approximately 11,510 kilometers  (about 7,000 miles), _i.e._, almost the diameter of our terrestrial  globe, or about four times the distance from Paris to Moscow!    Is it not impossible to realize that our Sun, with its entire system, is  lost in the Heavens at such a distance from his peers in Space? At the  distance of the least remote of the stars he would appear as one of the  smallest.           *       *       *       *       *    The nearest star to us is [alpha] of the Centaur, of first magnitude, a  neighbor of the South Pole, invisible in our latitudes. Its distance is  275,000 radii of the terrestrial orbit, _i.e._, 275,000 times 149  million kilometers, which gives 41 trillions, or 41,000 milliards of  kilometers (= 25-1/2 trillion miles). [A milliard = 1,000 millions, the  French billion. A trillion = 1,000 milliards, or a million millions, the  English billion. The _French_ nomenclature has been retained by the  translator.] At a speed of 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second  the light takes four years to come from thence. It is a fine double  star.    The next nearest star after this is a little orb invisible to the  unaided eye. It has no name, and stands as No. 21,185 in the Catalogue  of Lalande. It almost attains the seventh magnitude (6.8). Its distance  is 64 trillion kilometers (39-1/2 trillion miles).    The third of which the distance has been measured is the small star in  Cygnus, already referred to in Chapter II, in describing the  Constellations. Its distance is 69 trillion kilometers (42-1/2 trillion  miles). This, too, is a double star. The light takes seven years to  reach us.    As we have seen, the fine stars Sirius, Procyon, Aldebaran, Altair,  Vega, and Capella are more remote.    Our solar system is thus very isolated in the vastness of Infinitude.  The latest known planet of our system, Neptune, performs its revolutions  in space at 4 milliards, 470 million kilometers (2,771,400,000 miles)  from our Sun. Even this is a respectable distance! But beyond this  world, an immense gulf, almost a void abyss, extends to the nearest  star, [alpha] of the Centaur. Between Neptune and Centauris there is no  star to cheer the black and cold solitude of the immense vacuum. One or  two unknown planets, some wandering comets, and swarms of meteors,  doubtless traverse those unknown spaces, but all invisible to us.    Later on we will discuss the methods that have been employed in  measuring these distances. Let us now continue our description.           *       *       *       *       *    Now that we have some notion of the distance of the stars we must  approach them with the telescope, and compare them one with another.    Let us, for example, get close to Sirius: in this star we admire a sun  that is several times heavier than our own, and of much greater mass,  accompanied by a second sun that revolves round it in fifty years. Its  light is exceedingly white, and it notably burns with hydrogen flames,  like Vega and Altair.    Now let us approach Arcturus, Capella, Aldebaran: these are yellow stars  with golden rays, like our Sun, and the vapor of iron, of sodium, and of  many other metals can be identified in their spectrum. These stars are  older than the first, and the ruddy ones, such as Antares, Betelgeuse,  [alpha] of Hercules, are still older; several of them are variable, and  are on their way to final extinction.    The Heavens afford us a perennial store of treasure, wherein the  thinker, poet or artist can find inexhaustible subjects of  contemplation.    You have heard of the celestial jewels, the diamonds, rubies, emeralds,  sapphires, topazes, and other precious stones of the sidereal casket.  These marvels are met with especially among the double stars.    Our Sun, white and solitary, gives no idea of the real aspect of some of  its brothers in Infinitude. There are as many different types as there  are suns!    Stars, you will think, are like individuals: each has its distinct  characteristics: no two are comparable. And indeed this reflection is  justified. While human vanity does homage to Phoebus, divine King of  the Heavens, other suns of still greater magnificence form groups of two  or three splendid orbs, which roll the prodigious combinations of their  double, triple, or multiple systems through space, pouring on to the  worlds that accompany them a flood of changing light, now blue, now red,  now violet, etc.    In the inexhaustible variety of Creation there exist Suns that are  united in pairs, bound by a common destiny, cradled in the same  attraction, and often colored in the most delicate and entrancing shades  conceivable. Here will be a dazzling ruby, its glowing color shedding  joy; there a deep blue sapphire of tender tone; beyond, the finest  emeralds, hue of hope. Diamonds of translucent purity and whiteness  sparkle from the abyss, and shed their penetrating light into the vast  space. What splendors are scattered broadcast over the sky! what  profusion!    To the naked eye, the groups appear like ordinary stars, mere luminous  points of greater or less brilliancy; but the telescope soon discovers  the beauty of these systems; the star is duplicated into two distinct  suns, in close proximity. These groups of two or several suns are not  merely due to an effect of perspective--_i.e._, the presence of two or  more stars in our line of sight; as a rule they constitute real physical  systems, and these suns, associated in a common lot, rotate round one  another in a more or less rapid period, that varies for each system.    One of the most splendid of these _double stars_, and at the same time  one of the easiest to perceive, is [zeta] in the Great Bear, or Mizar,  mentioned above in describing this constellation. It has no contrasting  colors, but exactly resembles twin diamonds of the finest water, which  fascinate the gaze, even through a small objective.    Its components are of the second and fourth magnitudes, their distance =  14\"[6]. Some idea of their appearance in a small telescope may be  obtained from the subjoined figure (Fig. 17).    Another very brilliant pair is Castor. Magnitudes second and third.  Distance 5.6\"\". Very easy to observe. [gamma] in the Virgin resolves  into two splendid diamonds of third magnitude. Distance, 5.0\". Another  double star is [gamma] of the Ram, of fourth magnitude. Distance, 8.9\".    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--The double star Mizar.]    And here are two that are even more curious by reason of their coloring:  [gamma] in Andromeda, composed of a fine orange star, and one  emerald-green, which again is accompanied by a tiny comrade of the  deepest blue. This group in a good telescope is most attractive.  Magnitudes, second and fifth. Distance, 10\".    [beta] of the Swan, or Albireo, referred to in the last chapter, has  been analyzed into two stars: one golden-yellow, the other sapphire.  Magnitudes, third and fifth. Distance, 34\". [alpha] of the Greyhounds,  known also as the Heart of Charles II, is golden-yellow and lilac.  Magnitudes, third and fifth. Distance 20\".[7]    [alpha] of Hercules revolves a splendid emerald and a ruby in the skies;  [zeta] of the Lyre exhibits a yellow and a green star; Rigel, an  electric sun, and a small sapphire; Antares is ruddy and emerald-green;  [eta] of Perseus resolves into a burning red star, and one smaller that  is deep blue, and so on.           *       *       *       *       *    These exquisite double stars revolve in gracious and splendid couples  around one another, as in some majestic valse, marrying their  multi-colored fires in the midst of the starry firmament.    Here, we constantly receive a pure and dazzling white light from our  burning luminary. Its ray, indeed, contains the potentiality of every  conceivable color, but picture the fantastic illumination of the worlds  that gravitate round these multiple and colored suns as they shed floods  of blue and roseate, red, or orange light around them! What a fairy  spectacle must life present upon these distant universes!    Let us suppose that we inhabit a planet illuminated by two suns, one  blue, the other red.    It is morning. The sapphire sun climbs slowly up the Heavens, coloring  the atmosphere with a somber and almost melancholy hue. The blue disk  attains the zenith, and is beginning its descent toward the West, when  the East lights up with the flames of a scarlet sun, which in its turn  ascends the heights of the firmament. The West is plunged in the  penumbra of the rays of the blue sun, while the East is illuminated with  the purple and burning rays of the ruby orb.    The first sun is setting when the second noon shines for the inhabitants  of this strange world. But the red sun, too,"]]]
