Common nails are first used, being equally spaced, and the  ornamental heads are afterwards placed so as to cover their heads.    Next square the bottom and nail it to the parts just assembled. Square  the top to the same size.    The base stuff is squared on one edge only. The second edge--the upper  one--is to be beveled or sloped 1/8 in. to facilitate dusting and for  appearance sake. Fit these base pieces to place, mitering the joints.  Before fastening the parts to the chest proper, gauge a line 3/4 in.  from the lower edge and to a point 4-1/2 in. from each end, cut out to  this line and shape the base as shown in the drawing. Use finishing  nails for fastening the base to the chest. The heads should be \"set\" so  they may be covered later with a putty colored to match the finish.    In a similar manner plane up, cut and fit the back and hinge rails.  These rails should be kept a \"scant\" 1/8 in. below the top edges of the  chest proper. The overhang of the lid fits down over in such a way as to  form a dust-proof joint between lid and chest proper.    The overhang of the lid of 1 in. by 1-in. stock may next be mitered,  fitted and nailed to the lid. Thoroughly sandpaper all parts not so  treated and finish as follows: Put on all the oak pieces, two coats of  natural paste filler. This is best done before they are fastened in  place. Directions will be found on the cans in which the filler is kept.    The red of the cedar may be heightened by applying a mahogany stain made  of Bismark brown aniline and boiling water, in the proportion of 3 qt.  of water to 1 oz. of aniline. If applied hot the stain will enter the  wood better. When dry, sandpaper lightly with No. 00 paper, both this  and the oak-filled pieces.    Fasten the oak pieces in place and give the whole exterior a very thin  coat of shellac. After this has hardened, apply two coats of wax. Wax  comes in paste form and is to be applied with a cloth very sparingly.  Allow it to stand five or ten minutes then rub briskly with a soft dry  cloth to polish. The first coat is allowed to stand 24 hours before the  second is applied in a similar manner.    Another finish, known as an egg-shell gloss shellac finish, is obtained  by omitting the wax and instead applying from two to five more coats of  shellac. Allow each coat 24 hours in which to harden, and rub each  hardened coat to a smooth finish, using curled hair, or fine steel  wool, or fine oiled sandpaper, before applying the next.    [Illustration: Cedar Chest Complete]    The metal reinforcements for the corners can be bought at a hardware  store, as can the lock, hinges, and handles. These parts are applied in  the usual manner--butt hinges being used.    If well made, the chest is practically airtight. The interior is all of  red cedar, while the effect of the exterior in combining the light oak  and the red cedar is striking.          A TOOL FOR MAKING MORTISES      In the construction of mission furniture where mortise joints are mostly  used, those who cannot have access to a mortising machine will find the  following method of great assistance in obtaining a true mortise, which  is necessary in work of this kind.    [Illustration: Boring Holes for Tenons]    Take a block of wood, A, the exact thickness of the piece B to be  mortised, and with an auger bore a hole, the same size as the width of  the mortise to be made, exactly parallel to the sides of the block. This  can best be done on a drill press or a wood boring machine. If no  machine is available, great care should be taken in boring by hand, to  get the hole as nearly true as possible. Then nail a cleat, C, on the  side of the block, A, and let it extend down on piece B. Use a clamp to  hold the block in place while boring out the mortise. By changing the  position of the block and boring a number of holes, any length of  mortise can be made. The holes should afterwards be squared up with a  chisel.          A DRESSER FOR CHILD'S PLAYROOM      This dresser can be made of two kinds of wood as marked on the drawing  or it can be made all of one kind. The original dresser was made of oak  and walnut and was finished natural, the contrast between the light and  dark woods adding much to the value of the piece in the eyes of the  little ones. Have all surfaces that will show well sandpapered at the  mill. The following is a list of the material wanted:      4 oak posts, 1-1/2 in. square by 19-1/2 in., S-4-S.    3 walnut drawer fronts, 3/4 by 5 by 17 in., S-2-S.    6 yellow poplar drawer sides, 3/8 by 5 by 12 in., S-2-S.    3 yellow poplar backs, 3/8 by 4-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S.    3 yellow poplar bottoms, 3/8 by 12 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 oak front stretchers, 7/8 by 1-3/4 by 17-1/2 in., S-4-S.    4 oak side rails, 7/8 by 2 by 12 in., S-4-S.    2 walnut side panels, 1/4 by 11 by 14-1/2 in., S-2-S.    8 oak drawer slides, 7/8 by 2 by 10-1/2 in., S-2-S.    6 oak drawer guides, 1/2 by 3/4 by 10-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 oak back stretchers, 7/8 by 2 by 17-1/2 in., S-2-S.    1 oak top, 5/8 by 14 by 20-1/2 in., S-2-S.    3 sq. ft. of 3/8 in. matched yellow pine ceiling for back.    MIRROR SUPPORT      1 walnut piece, 7/8 by 1-3/4 by 20-1/2 in., S-2-S.    1 walnut piece, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 18 in., S-2-S.    1 oak piece, 3/4 by 1-1/4 by 10-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 oak pieces, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 11 in., S-2-S.    1 walnut bracket piece, 7/8 by 1-1/4 by 5 in., S-2-S.    MIRROR FRAME PARTS      2 walnut pieces, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 12-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 walnut pieces, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 10-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 oak pieces, 1/4 by 3/8 by 10 in., S-4-S.    2 oak pieces, 1/4 by 3/8 by 8 in., S-4-S.    1 back, 3/16 by 8 by 10 in., soft wood.    2 cleats, 3/8 by 1-1/4 by 8 in.    1 plain mirror glass, 7-1/2 by 9-1/2 in.    [Illustration: Details of Dresser]    Begin by planing the four posts to length. The lower ends should be  slightly beveled to prevent their slivering. Cut the mortises for the  tenons that are on the ends of the side rails. These rails are to be 7/8  by 2 in. and the tenons should be 3/8 by 1-1/4 in. wide by 3/4 in. long.  The posts should be rabbeted down to their middles to a depth of 3/8  in. so as to receive the 1/4-in. end panels. The end rails should be cut  to length and their tenons worked after one edge of each has been  rabbeted as were the posts.    [Illustration: Dresser Complete]    Having squared the panels to size, put the two ends of the dresser  together with glue. Next make the four frames which are to carry the  drawers. They should measure from outside to outside, in length 17-1/2  in.; in width, 12-1/2 in. It is intended that the short pieces shall be  tenoned into the long ones. When these frames are ready, cut out each  corner as indicated in the cross section drawing. Reduce to size the  drawer guides and fasten them in place. Dowel the frames to the ends of  the dresser in the places indicated on the drawing. Put on the back,  nailing into frames to the ends of the dresser in the places indicated  and fasten the top in place, putting screws into it from the under side.    The mirror frame and support should next be made. The drawing shows  quite clearly the parts and their relation to each other. All the slopes  are of 45 deg. Instead of rabbeting the mirror frame, a 1/4 by 3/8-in.  fillet of oak is nailed around to form the recess, the walnut frame and  oak fillet making a pretty contrast. All nail holes are to be filled  with putty colored to match the finish. Wooden pins or round-head screws  are to be used to fasten the mirror frame to its support and should be  placed above center an inch or so.    The drawers are to be constructed in the usual manner. It is a good plan  to make the grooves 1/16 in. narrower than the stock is thick to insure  a fit, chamfering the under or back sides of the bottom and back if  necessary. Make the sides of the drawers of such a length that when the  drawer has been pushed in as far as it will go, the front will be  recessed about 1/4 in. behind the front crosspieces. Groove the inside  of the drawer front 3/16 in. to receive the bottom. The mirror should  not be placed until the wood has been finished.    [Illustration: DRAWER CONSTRUCTION]    Finish the wood natural, apply three coats of varnish. Rub the first two  with haircloth or curled hair and the last with pulverized pumice stone  and crude oil or raw linseed oil. This gives an egg-shell gloss. For a  dull finish, rub the varnish after it has become bone dry with  pulverized pumice stone and water, using a piece of rubbing felt. Rub  until the surface is smooth and even, and clean with a wet sponge or  chamois skin. If a polished finish is desired, rub first with pulverized  pumice stone and water, then with rotten stone and water. Finish with a  mixture of oil and a little pulverized rotten stone.          CUTTING TENONS WITH A HAND-SAW      This home-made tool will be a great help in the construction of mission  furniture. With its use, tenons may be entirely cut with a saw,  discarding the use of a chisel and mallet. The device consists of a  convenient length of straight board, A, Fig. 1, wide enough to cover the  widest piece to be tenoned. A piece of board, B, is fastened to A with  brads or small screws. This board should have a thickness equal to the  piece to be cut from the side of the tenon. The piece C is fastened to A  and B with small cleats at their upper ends. The space between B and C  should be wide enough for the blade of a saw to run through easily, and  also long enough to take in the widest part of the saw blade. The tool  and piece to be tenoned are placed in a vise as shown in Fig. 2. The  width of the piece removed for the tenon may be varied by putting in  pieces of cardboard between the work, E, and the piece A, Fig. 1.    [Illustration: Sawing Tenons]          ARTS AND CRAFTS OIL LAMP      Electricity and gas are not always accessible in suburban or country "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],[0,"Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#9)"],[1,"of these three poems are as follows: A  maiden loses her lover in the wars; she murmurs at Providence  and is vainly reproved for such blasphemy by her mother.  Providence at length loses patience and sends her lover's spirit,  to all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate  maiden to elope. Instead of riding to a church or bridal chamber  the unpleasant bridegroom resorts to the graveyard and repairs to  his own grave, from which he has recently issued to execute his  errand. It is a repulsive subject. \"Svetlana,\" however, is more  agreeable than its prototype \"Leonora,\" inasmuch as the whole  catastrophe turns out a dream brought on by \"sorcery,\" during the  \"sviatki\" or Holy Nights (see Canto V. st. x), and the dreamer  awakes to hear the tinkling of her lover's sledge approaching.  \"Svetlana\" has been translated by Sir John Bowring.]    V    Meantime Oneguine's apparition  At Larina's abode produced  Quite a sensation; the position  To all good neighbours' sport conduced.  Endless conjectures all propound  And secretly their views expound.  What jokes and guesses now abound,  A beau is for Tattiana found!  In fact, some people were assured  The wedding-day had been arranged,  But the date subsequently changed  Till proper rings could be procured.  On Lenski's matrimonial fate  They long ago had held debate.    VI    Of course Tattiana was annoyed  By such allusions scandalous,  Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed  With satisfaction marvellous,  As in her heart the thought sank home,  I am in love, my hour hath come!  Thus in the earth the seed expands  Obedient to warm Spring's commands.  Long time her young imagination  By indolence and languor fired  The fated nutriment desired;  And long internal agitation  Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,  She waited for--I don't know whom!    VII    The fatal hour had come at last--  She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!  Alas! for now before her passed  The same warm vision constantly;  Now all things round about repeat  Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet  His name: the tenderness of home  Tiresome unto her hath become  And the kind-hearted servitors:  Immersed in melancholy thought,  She hears of conversation nought  And hated casual visitors,  Their coming which no man expects,  And stay whose length none recollects.    VIII    Now with what eager interest  She the delicious novel reads,  With what avidity and zest  She drinks in those seductive deeds!  All the creations which below  From happy inspiration flow,  The swain of Julia Wolmar,  Malek Adel and De Linar,(31)  Werther, rebellious martyr bold,  And that unrivalled paragon,  The sleep-compelling Grandison,  Our tender dreamer had enrolled  A single being: 'twas in fine  No other than Oneguine mine.    [Note 31: The heroes of two romances much in vogue in Pushkin's  time: the former by Madame Cottin, the latter by the famous  Madame Krudener. The frequent mention in the course of this  poem of romances once enjoying a European celebrity but now  consigned to oblivion, will impress the reader with the  transitory nature of merely mediocre literary reputation. One  has now to search for the very names of most of the popular  authors of Pushkin's day and rummage biographical dictionaries  for the dates of their births and deaths. Yet the poet's prime  was but fifty years ago, and had he lived to a ripe old age he  would have been amongst us still. He was four years younger  than the late Mr. Thomas Carlyle. The decadence of Richardson's  popularity amongst his countrymen is a fact familiar to all.]    IX    Dreaming herself the heroine  Of the romances she preferred,  Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,--(32)  Tattiana through the forest erred,  And the bad book accompanies.  Upon those pages she descries  Her passion's faithful counterpart,  Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.  She heaves a sigh and deep intent  On raptures, sorrows not her own,  She murmurs in an undertone  A letter for her hero meant:  That hero, though his merit shone,  Was certainly no Grandison.    [Note 32: Referring to Richardson's \"Clarissa Harlowe,\" \"La  Nouvelle Heloise,\" and Madame de Stael's \"Delphine.\"]    X    Alas! my friends, the years flit by  And after them at headlong pace  The evanescent fashions fly  In motley and amusing chase.  The world is ever altering!  Farthingales, patches, were the thing,  And courtier, fop, and usurer  Would once in powdered wig appear;  Time was, the poet's tender quill  In hopes of everlasting fame  A finished madrigal would frame  Or couplets more ingenious still;  Time was, a valiant general might  Serve who could neither read nor write.    XI    Time was, in style magniloquent  Authors replete with sacred fire  Their heroes used to represent  All that perfection could desire;  Ever by adverse fate oppressed,  Their idols they were wont to invest  With intellect, a taste refined,  And handsome countenance combined,  A heart wherein pure passion burnt;  The excited hero in a trice  Was ready for self-sacrifice,  And in the final tome we learnt,  Vice had due punishment awarded,  Virtue was with a bride rewarded.    XII    But now our minds are mystified  And Virtue acts as a narcotic,  Vice in romance is glorified  And triumphs in career erotic.  The monsters of the British Muse  Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,  The idols of their adoration  A Vampire fond of meditation,  Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,  The Eternal Jew or the Corsair  Or the mysterious Sbogar.(33)  Byron's capricious phantasy  Could in romantic mantle drape  E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.    [Note 33: \"Melmoth,\" a romance by Maturin, and \"Jean Sbogar,\" by  Ch. Nodier. \"The Vampire,\" a tale published in 1819, was  erroneously attributed to Lord Byron. \"Salathiel; the Eternal  Jew,\" a romance by Geo. Croly.]    XIII    My friends, what means this odd digression?  May be that I by heaven's decrees  Shall abdicate the bard's profession,  And shall adopt some new caprice.  Thus having braved Apollo's rage  With humble prose I'll fill my page  And a romance in ancient style  Shall my declining years beguile;  Nor shall my pen paint terribly  The torment born of crime unseen,  But shall depict the touching scene  Of Russian domesticity;  I will descant on love's sweet dream,  The olden time shall be my theme.    XIV    Old people's simple conversations  My unpretending page shall fill,  Their offspring's innocent flirtations  By the old lime-tree or the rill,  Their Jealousy and separation  And tears of reconciliation:  Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,  But finally in wedlock bind.  The passionate speeches I'll repeat,  Accents of rapture or despair  I uttered to my lady fair  Long ago, prostrate at her feet.  Then they came easily enow,  My tongue is somewhat rusty now.    XV    Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!  What bitter tears with thee I shed!  Thou hast resigned thy destiny  Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.  Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,  Hope with her fascinating power  To dire contentment shall give birth  And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.  Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,  Fantastic images shall swarm  In thy imagination warm,  Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,  And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,  Confront thy fated torturer!    XVI    Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.  She seeks the garden in her need--  Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes  And cares not farther to proceed;  Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues  With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,  Barely to draw her breath she seems,  Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.  And now 'tis night, the guardian moon  Sails her allotted course on high,  And from the misty woodland nigh  The nightingale trills forth her tune;  Restless Tattiana sleepless lay  And thus unto her nurse did say:    XVII    \"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.  Open the window--sit by me.\"  \"What ails thee, dear?\"--\"I feel depressed.  Relate some ancient history.\"  \"But which, my dear?--In days of yore  Within my memory I bore  Many an ancient legend which  In monsters and fair dames was rich;  But now my mind is desolate,  What once I knew is clean forgot--  Alas! how wretched now my lot!\"  \"But tell me, nurse, can you relate  The days which to your youth belong?  Were you in love when you were young?\"--    XVIII    \"Alack! Tattiana,\" she replied,  \"We never loved in days of old,  My mother-in-law who lately died(34)  Had killed me had the like been told.\"  \"How came you then to wed a man?\"--  \"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan  Was younger than myself, my light,  For I myself was thirteen quite;(35)  The matchmaker a fortnight sped,  Her suit before my parents pressing:  At last my father gave his blessing,  And bitter tears of fright I shed.  Weeping they loosed my tresses long(36)  And led me off to church with song.\"    [Note 34: A young married couple amongst Russian peasants  reside in the house of the bridegroom's father till the  \"tiaglo,\" or family circle is broken up by his death.]    [Note 35: Marriages amongst Russian serfs used formerly to  take place at ridiculously early ages. Haxthausen asserts  that strong hearty peasant women were to be seen at work  in the fields with their infant husbands in their arms. The  inducement lay in the fact that the \"tiaglo\" (see previous  note) received an additional lot of the communal land for  every male added to its number, though this could have formed  an inducement in the southern and fertile provinces of Russia  only, as it is believed that agriculture in the north is so  unremunerative that land has often to be forced upon the  peasants, in order that the taxes, for which the whole Commune  is responsible to Government, may be paid. The abuse of early  marriages was regulated by Tsar Nicholas.]    [Note 36: Courtships were not unfrequently carried on in the  larger villages, which alone could support such an individual,  by means of a \"svakha,\" or matchmaker.
