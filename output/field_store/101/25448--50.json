Barbadense_, L. (nom. vulg. _Pernambuko_,  Tag.), and the _G. arboreum_, L. (_Bulak na bundok_, _Bulak na totoo_,  Tag.).    Cotton is used extensively in bacteriological laboratories as a  filter of liquids and gases. This property possessed by cotton,  of retaining in its fibers the germs of the air was utilized by  the famous French surgeon Guérin in the treatment that bears his  name. The denuded surfaces exposed to infection by airborne bacteria  are completely protected against them when, according to the Guérin  treatment, they are enveloped in large masses of fresh, raw cotton,  presumably free from microörganisms. To avoid the possibility of  infection by the cotton itself, it is now the practice to sterilize  it either by means of chemicals such as carbolic acid, iodoform,  etc., or by physical means such as high temperatures.    Raw cotton is used in compounding gun cotton or explosive cotton, also  named _pyroxylin_, and this is used to make collodion, so extensively  employed in medicine.    Pyroxylin is made by treating cotton with equal parts of nitric and  sulphuric acids, then washing with water till the latter ceases to  give a precipitate with chloride of baryta; then dry in the air.    Collodion is made by dissolving 5 grams of pyroxylin in the following  mixture:              Sulphuric ether, rectified          75 grams.          Alcohol at 95°                      20 grams.

Mix.      Botanical Description.--A plant 2-3° high, of herbaceous stem, branches  sparsely covered with small, black points; leaves cleft at their base,  with 5 lobules and a small gland on the midrib. Petiole long with  2 stipules at the base. Flowers axillary, solitary. Calyx double;  the outer portion divided in 3 parts, heart-shaped, and each with  5-9 long, acute teeth. Corolla bell-shaped, of 5 petals, pale yellow  or turning rose color, purple at the base. Stamens many, inserted  on a column. Stigma in 4-5 parts. Ovary of 3-5 compartments. Seeds  enveloped in the fiber.    Habitat.--Batangas, Ilocos.        _Bombax malabaricum_, DC. (_B. Ceiba_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Taglinaw_, _Bobuy gubat_, Tag.; _Talutu_, Vis.    Uses.--In India the roots are used to obtain an astringent and  alterative effect and form part of a well-known aphrodisiac mixture  called _Musla-Samul_. If the trunk is incised, an astringent gum exudes  and this they use in diarrhoea, dysentery and menorrhagia. Dose of  the gum 2 1/2-3 grams.    Botanical Description.--A large tree covered with sharp, conical  and tough spines. Leaves alternate, compound, digitate, caducous;  leaflets 5-7 with long common petiole. Flowers solitary or in axillary  cymes, hermaphrodite, regular. Calyx gamosepalous, cup-shaped, with  5 acute lobules. Corolla violet, with 5 deep clefts; æstivation  convolute. Stamens numerous, united at the base in 5 bundles,  free above, bearing unilocular anthers. Ovary of 5 many-ovulate  compartments, with a style ending in 5 short branches. Capsule woody,  ovoid, loculicidal, with 5 valves. Seeds numerous, black, covered  with cottony fibers.    Habitat.--Angat, Iloilo. Blooms in February.        _Eriodendron anfractuosum_, DC. (_Bombax pentandrum_, L.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Boboy_, Tag.; _Doldol_, Vis.; _Bulak kastila_, Pam.    Uses.--The principal use made of this plant in the Philippines is to  stuff the pillows with the cotton that it yields. The leaves, pounded  with a little water, yield a mucilaginous juice highly prized by the  natives as a wash for the hair, mixing it with _gogo_. The root bark  is emetic in dose of 1.25 grm. The cotton yielded by this tree should  be used for the same therapeutic purposes as that of gossypium, and  being of an exceedingly fine fiber it would give better results. The  Filipinos use it to treat burns and sores. I have often used it,  being careful always to impregnate it thoroughly with some antiseptic  solution. In the treatment of burns it has been my custom to envelope  the part in a thick layer of this cotton, after bathing it with a  tepid 1-2,000 solution of corrosive sublimate and dusting with a very  fine powder of boracic acid.    Botanical Description.--A tree 40-50° high. Trunk somewhat thorny, the  branches horizontal, arranged in stars of 3-4. Leaves compound with  7 leaflets, lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers in umbels of 8 or  more flowerets. No common peduncle, the individual ones long. Calyx,  5 obtuse sepals, slightly notched. Corolla, 5 fleshy petals, obtusely  lanceolate and bent downwards. Stamens 5. Anthers of irregular shape,  peltate, with the borders deeply undulate. Stigma in 5 parts. Pod 4-6'  long, spindle-shaped. Seeds enveloped in very fine cotton fiber.    Habitat.--Exceedingly common in all parts of the islands. Blooms  in December.          STERCULIACEÆ.    Sterculia Family.        _Sterculia foetida_, L. (_S. polyphilla_, R. Br.; _Clompanus major_,  Rumph.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Kalumpang_, Tag.; _Bangar_, Iloc.    Uses.--A decoction of the leaves is used as a wash in suppurative  cutaneous eruptions. The fruit is astringent and is used in Java as  an injection for gonorrhoea. In western India and in the Philippines  it is an article of diet. The seeds yield an oil that is used for  illumination and as a comestible.    Botanical Description.--A large tree of the first order with digitate  leaves of 6-8 leaflets, broad, oval, very acute, tough, glabrous,  growing on a long common petiole. No petiole proper. Flowers of a  foetid or feculent odor, hermaphrodite, in compound racemes. Calyx  fleshy, soft pubescent internally, bell-shaped, in 5 parts. Corolla  none. Nectary 5-toothed, on the end of a small column. Stamens  15, inserted on the border of the nectary by threes, forming a  triangle. Filament almost entirely wanting. In the midst of the stamens  is visible a small, hairy body of 5 lobules which are the rudiments of  the ovaries. The style protrudes and twists downwards. Stigma thick,  compressed, of 5 lobules. Fruit, five woody pods, semicircular,  joined to a common center, each enclosing many oval seeds inserted  in the superior suture.    Habitat.--Luzon, Mindanao, Cebú, Iloilo. Blooms in March.        _Sterculia urens_, Roxb. (_S. cordifolia_, Blanco; _Cavallium urens_,  Schott. & Endl.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Banilad_, Tag.    Uses.--The root bark is pounded up and applied locally in orchitis  and in severe contusions with supposed fracture of the bones; native  charlatans pretend to cure the latter condition by this treatment.    The trunk exudes a sort of gum, which with water forms a sort of  colorless, odorless gelatin which dissolves at the boiling point. I  do not know to what use this gum is applied in therapeutics, but it  is often found mixed with the Senegambian gum acacia.    Botanical Description.--A tree with leaves bunched, 7-9-veined,  heart-shaped, ovate, broad and entire, glabrous upper surface,  short white down on lower surface. Petioles of same length as the  leaves. Flowers small, yellow, numerous, polygamous, growing in  large, terminal panicles covered with a fine, sticky down. Calyx  bell-shaped, 5 acute papyraceous divisions, each bearing a small  gland near its base. No corolla. Stamens 10, united in a column, the  upper ends free. Five pods joined at one point, half-moon shaped,  with woody shell, glabrous within and with a short down on the  outer surface. Three or four kidney-shaped seeds, the testa thin  and crustaceous.    Habitat.--Cebú, Iloilo.        _Kleinhovia hospitata_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Tanag_, Tag., Vis.; _Hamitanago_, Vis.; _Panampat_,  Pam.; _Bitnong_, Iloc.    Uses.--The decoction of the leaves is used, according to P. Blanco,  to cure the itch. It is also used locally in all forms of dermatitis,  and the tender leaves and sprouts are cooked and eaten.    Botanical Description.--Tree 25° high or more, with leaves alternate,  heart-shaped, pubescent, almost entire. Petioles long with 2 stipules  at the base. Flowers red, axillary, in large panicles. Calyx, 5 sepals,  almost linear. Corolla the same size as the calyx, 5 linear petals,  the lower shorter and curved. Nectary bell-shaped, of 5 parts, each  3-toothed; set on a column; at its base a wavy fringe with dentate  edge. Stamens 15. No filaments. Anthers seated on the 15 teeth of  the nectary. Ovary within the nectary, 5-angled, 5 apartments each  containing an almost spherical seed.    Habitat.--Luzon, Mindanao, Panay, Cebú, Joló. Flowers in March and  September.        _Helicteres Isora_, L. (_H. chrysocalyx_, Miq.; _H. Roxburghii_,  G. Don.)    Nom. Vulg.--(?); _Indian Screw Tree_, Eng.    Uses.--I am ignorant of the use that the Filipinos make of this  plant, though it is very possible that they do not employ it at all  in medicine, which is usually the case with those plants to which they  have given no name. In India the peculiar spiral form of the fruit has  suggested its application, according to the theories of the doctrine  of symbolism. Ainslie says that the Hindoos use it to treat diseases  of the external auditory canal. On account of its emollient properties  and probably on account of its twisted form, it is used internally as  a decoction, in flatulence and the intestinal colic of children. It  is indispensable in the marriage ceremonies of the caste of Vaisya,  among whom it is customary for the groom to wear on his wrists in  the form of bracelets, strings of this fruit combined with that of  _Randia dumetorum_.    The root yields a juice which is employed in skin diseases, in abscess,  acid in cardialgia.

She stopped and leant her elbows  against the parapet of the embankment. He did likewise. There is at  times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have  suggested to us eternal comradeship. She moved her elbows before saying:    \"I have behaved ridiculously.\"    He was following his own thoughts.    \"I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what  came over me.\"    \"I nearly fainted myself,\" he said; but she felt that her attitude  repelled him.    \"Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.\"    \"Oh, all right.\"    \"And--this is the real point--you know how silly people are  gossiping--ladies especially, I am afraid--you understand what I mean?\"    \"I'm afraid I don't.\"    \"I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?\"    \"Your behaviour? Oh, yes, all right--all right.\"    \"Thank you so much. And would you--\"    She could not carry her request any further. The river was rushing below  them, almost black in the advancing night. He had thrown her photographs  into it, and then he had told her the reason. It struck her that it was  hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man. He would do her no harm by  idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he might  even have a high opinion of her. But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts,  like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe. It was useless to say  to him, \"And would you--\" and hope that he would complete the sentence  for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in  that beautiful picture. She had been in his arms, and he remembered it,  just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought  in Alinari's shop. It was not exactly that a man had died; something  had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character  tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.    \"Well, thank you so much,\" she repeated, \"How quickly these accidents do  happen, and then one returns to the old life!\"    \"I don't.\"    Anxiety moved her to question him.    His answer was puzzling: \"I shall probably want to live.\"    \"But why, Mr. Emerson? What do you mean?\"    \"I shall want to live, I say.\"    Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno,  whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.        Chapter V: Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing    It was a family saying that \"you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett  would turn.\" She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy's  adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid  suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson. She and Miss  Lavish had had an adventure also. They had been stopped at the Dazio  coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and  desoeuvre, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. It might  have been most unpleasant. Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any  one.    For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone. None  of her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by  the embankment. Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at  dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of \"Too much  Beethoven.\" But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure,  not that she had encountered it. This solitude oppressed her; she was  accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,  contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking  right or wrong.    At breakfast next morning she took decisive action. There were two plans  between which she had to choose. Mr. Beebe was walking up to the  Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies. Would Miss  Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party? Charlotte declined for  herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. But  she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing  money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties--all of which Miss  Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.    \"No, Charlotte!\" cried the girl, with real warmth. \"It's very kind of  Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you. I had much rather.\"    \"Very well, dear,\" said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure  that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy. How  abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always! But now she should  alter. All morning she would be really nice to her.    She slipped her arm into her cousin's, and they started off along the  Lung' Arno. The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and  colour. Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at  it. She then made her usual remark, which was \"How I do wish Freddy and  your mother could see this, too!\"    Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly  where she did.    \"Look, Lucia! Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party. I  feared you would repent you of your choice.\"    Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent. Yesterday had been  a muddle--queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down  easily on paper--but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping  were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del  Gallo. Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not  to re-enter it. She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett's  insinuations.    But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately  remained. Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the  river to the Piazza Signoria. She could not have believed that stones, a  Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. For a  moment she understood the nature of ghosts.    The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss  Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand. She hailed them  briskly. The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an  idea which she thought would work up into a book.    \"Oh, let me congratulate you!\" said Miss Bartlett. \"After your despair  of yesterday! What a fortunate thing!\"    \"Aha! Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck. Now, you are to tell  me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.\" Lucy poked at  the ground with her parasol.    \"But perhaps you would rather not?\"    \"I'm sorry--if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.\"    The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable  that a girl should feel deeply.    \"It is I who am sorry,\" said Miss Lavish \"literary hacks are shameless  creatures. I believe there's no secret of the human heart into which we  wouldn't pry.\"    She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few  calculations in realism. Then she said that she had been in the  Piazza since eight o'clock collecting material. A good deal of it was  unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt. The two men had  quarrelled over a five-franc note. For the five-franc note she should  substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and  at the same time furnish an excellent plot.    \"What is the heroine's name?\" asked Miss Bartlett.    \"Leonora,\" said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.    \"I do hope she's nice.\"    That desideratum would not be omitted.    \"And what is the plot?\"    Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot. But it all came while  the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.    \"I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,\" Miss Lavish  concluded. \"It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.  Of course, this is the barest outline. There will be a deal of local  colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall  also introduce some humorous characters. And let me give you all fair  warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.\"    \"Oh, you wicked woman,\" cried Miss Bartlett. \"I am sure you are thinking  of the Emersons.\"    Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.    \"I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.  It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going  to paint so far as I can. For I repeat and I insist, and I have always  held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday's is not the less  tragic because it happened in humble life.\"    There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded. Then the  cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the  square.    \"She is my idea of a really clever woman,\" said Miss Bartlett. \"That  last remark struck me as so particularly true. It should be a most  pathetic novel.\"    Lucy assented. At present her great aim was not to get put into it. Her  perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss  Lavish had her on trial for an ingenue.    \"She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,\"  continued Miss Bartlett slowly. \"None but the superficial would be  shocked at her. We had a long talk yesterday. She believes in justice  and truth and human interest. She told me also that she has a high  opinion of the destiny of woman--Mr. Eager! Why, how nice! What a  pleasant surprise!\"    \"Ah, not for me,\" said the chaplain blandly, \"for I have been watching  you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.\"    \"We were chatting to Miss Lavish.\"    His brow contracted.    \"So I saw. Were you indeed? Andate via! sono occupato!\" The last remark  was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a  courteous smile. \"I am about to venture a suggestion. Would you and  Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week--a  drive in the hills? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.  There is a point on"]]]
