I even formed agreeable ideas of our going to the hospital. No  state appeared to me so poor and miserable, which I should not have  thought easy, in comparison with the continual domestic persecutions I  underwent. My father, who loved me tenderly, and whom I honored beyond  expression, knew nothing of it. God so permitted it, that I should have  him also displeased with me for some time. My mother was continually  telling him that I was an ungrateful creature, showing no regard for  them, but all for my husband's family. Appearances were against me. I  did not go to see them as often as I should. They knew not the  captivity I was in; what I was obliged to bear in defending them. These  complaints of my mother, and a trivial affair that fell out, lessened a  little my father's fond regard for me; but it did not last long. My  mother-in-law reproached me, saying, \"No afflictions befell them till I  came into the house. All misfortunes came with me.\" On the other hand  my mother wanted me to exclaim against my husband which I could never  submit to do.    We continued to meet with loss after loss, the king retrenching a  considerable share of our revenues, besides great sums of money, which  we lost by L'Hotel de Ville. I could have no rest or peace, in such  great afflictions. I had no mortal to console me, or to advise me. My  sister, who had educated me, had departed this life. She died two  months before my marriage. I had no other for a confidant.    I declare, that I find much repugnance in saying so many things of my  mother-in-law. I have no doubt that my own indiscretion, my caprice,  and the occasional sallies of a warm temper, drew many of the crosses  upon me. Although I had what the world calls patience, yet I had  neither a relish nor love for the cross. Their conduct toward me, which  appeared so unreasonable, should not be looked upon with worldly eyes.  We should look higher and then we shall see that it was directed by  Providence for my eternal advantage.    I now dressed my hair in the most modest manner, never painted, and to  subdue the vanity which still had possession of me, I rarely looked in  the glass. My reading was confined to books of devotion, such as Thomas  a'Kempis, and the works of St. Francis de Sales. I read these aloud for  the improvement of the servants, while the maid was dressing my hair. I  suffered myself to be dressed just as she pleased, which freed me from  a great deal of trouble. It took away the occasions wherein my vanity  used to be exercised. I knew not how things were; but they always liked  me, and thought all well in point of dress. If on some particular days  I wanted to appear better, it proved worse. The more indifferent I was  about dress the better I appeared. How often have I gone to church, not  so much to worship God as to be seen. Other women, jealous of me,  affirmed that I painted; they told my confessor, who chided me for it,  though I assured him I was innocent. I often spoke in my own praise,  and sought to raise myself by depreciating others. Yet these faults  gradually deceased; for I was very sorry afterward for having committed  them. I often examined myself very strictly, writing down my faults  from week to week, and from month to month, to see how much I was  improved or reformed. Alas! this labor, though fatiguing, was of but  little service, because I trusted in my own efforts. I wished indeed to  be reformed, but my good desires were weak and languid.    At one time my husband's absence was so long, and in the meantime my  crosses and vexations at home so great, that I determined to go to him.  My mother-in-law strongly opposed it. This once my father interfering,  and insisting on it, she let me go. On my arrival I found he had almost  died. Through vexation and fretting he was very much changed. He could  not finish his affairs, having no liberty in attending to them, keeping  himself concealed at the Hotel de Longueville, where Madame de  Longueville was extremely kind to me. I came publicly, and he was in  great fear lest I should make him known. In a rage he bid me return  home. Love and my long absence from him surmounting every other reason,  he soon relented and suffered me to stay with him. He kept me eight  days without letting me stir out of his sight. Fearing the effects of  such a close confinement on my constitution, he desired me to go and  take a walk in the garden. There I met Madame de Longueville, who  testified great joy on seeing me.    I cannot express all the kindness I met with in this house. All the  domestics served me with emulation, and applauded me on account of my  appearance, and exterior deportment. Yet I was much on my guard against  too much attention. I never entered into discourse with any man when  alone. I admitted none into my coach, not even my relations, unless my  husband were in it. There was not any rule of discretion which I did  not duly observe, to avoid giving suspicion to my husband, or subject  of calumny to others. Everyone studied there how to contribute to  divert or oblige me. Outwardly everything appeared agreeable. Chagrin  had so overcome and ruffled my husband that I had continually something  to bear. Sometimes he threatened to throw the supper out of the  windows. I said, he would then do me an injury, as I had a keen  appetite. I made him laugh and I laughed with him. Before that,  melancholy prevailed over all my endeavors, and over the love he had  for me. God both armed me with patience and gave me the grace to return  him no answer. The devil, who attempted to draw me into some offence,  was forced to retire in confusion, through the signal assistance of  that grace.    I loved my God and was unwilling to displease Him, and I was inwardly  grieved on account of that vanity, which still I found myself unable to  eradicate. Inward distresses, together with oppressive crosses, which I  had daily to encounter, at length threw me into sickness. As I was  unwilling to incommode the Hotel de Longueville I had myself moved to  another house. The disease proved violent and tedious, insomuch that  the physicians despaired of my life. The priest, a pious man, seemed  fully satisfied with the state of my mind. He said, \"I should die like  a saint.\" But my sins were too present and too painful to my heart to  have such presumption. At midnight they administered the sacrament to  me as they hourly expected my departure. It was a scene of general  distress in the family and among all who knew me. There were none  indifferent to my death but myself. I beheld it without fear, and was  insensible to its approach. It was far otherwise with my husband. He  was inconsolable when he saw there was no hope. I no sooner began to  recover, than notwithstanding all his love, his usual fretfulness  returned. I recovered almost miraculously and to me this disorder  proved a great blessing. Beside a very great patience under violent  pains, it served to instruct me much in my view of the emptiness of all  worldly things. It detached me from myself and gave me new courage to  suffer better than I had done. The love of God gathered strength in my  heart, with a desire to please and be faithful to Him in my condition.  I reaped several other advantages from it which I need not relate, I  had yet six months to drag along with a slow fever. It was thought that  it would terminate in death.    Thy time, O my God, had not yet arrived for taking me to Thyself. Thy  designs over me were widely different from the expectations of those  about me; it being Thy determination to make me both the object of Thy  mercy and the victim of Thy justice.          CHAPTER 8      After long languishing, at length I regained my former health. About  this time my dear mother departed this life in great tranquility of  mind. Beside her other good qualities, she had been particularly  charitable to the poor. This virtue, so acceptable to God, He was  graciously pleased to commence rewarding even in this life. Though she  was but twenty-four hours sick, she was made perfectly easy about  everything that was near and dear to her in this world.    I now applied myself to my duties, never failing to practice that of  prayer twice a day. I watched over myself, to subdue my spirit  continually. I went to visit the poor in their houses, assisting them  in their distresses. I did (according to my understanding) all the good  I knew.    Thou, O my God, increased both my love and my patience, in proportion  to my sufferings. I regretted not the temporal advantages with which my  mother distinguished my brother above me. Yet they fell on me about  that, as about everything else. I also had for some time a severe ague.  I did not indeed serve Thee yet with that fervor which Thou didst give  me soon after. For I would still have been glad to reconcile Thy love  with the love of myself and of the creature. Unhappily I always found  some who loved me, and whom I could not forbear wishing to please. It  was not that I loved them, but it was for the love that I bore to  myself.    A lady, an exile, came to my father's house. He offered her an  apartment which she accepted, and she stayed a long time. She was one  of true piety and inward devotion. She had a great esteem for me,  because I desired to love God. She remarked that I had the virtues of  an active and bustling life; but I had not yet attained the simplicity  of prayer which she experienced. Sometimes she dropped a word to me on  that subject. As my time had not yet come, I did not understand her.  Her example instructed me more than her words. I observed on her  countenance something which marked a great enjoyment of the presence of  God. By the exertion of studied reflection and thoughts I tried to  attain it but to little purpose. I wanted to have, by my own efforts,  what I could not acquire except by ceasing from all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22285"],[0,"An American Suffragette (#9)"],[1,"progress we allow bigotry  and prejudice to hamper us in getting the most out of the wisdom around  us as well as that of the ages, all of which is correlated. Yet very  often the orthodox Christian, who believes that Christ not only healed  the sick but also raised the dead, decries the Christian Scientist who  only professes to restore the sick on the theory that disease cannot  exist in an individual properly imbued with Christ's teachings. Too  often the orthodox doctor of medicine denounces the healer who overcomes  apparent disease through mental suggestion or arrests a nervous  breakdown in a patient by teaching that patient how to relax, when the  doctor himself does not hesitate to give bread pills in the first  instance and to recommend a sanitarium where relaxation is the only  thing attempted in the second. And I presume this quotation from the  Dhamma-pada, which is many centuries older than the Christian religion,  would be denounced as heresy by some of the Christian Scientists,  although it embodies the spirit and almost the words of their own  teachings: 'All that we are is the result of what we have thought. It is  founded on our thoughts; it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speak  or act with an evil thought, pain follows him as the wheel follows the  foot of the ox that draws the carriage.'\"    Presently Dr. Earl hailed a passing taxi-cab, and gave the order to be  taken to the Whittier Studios. The drive home was silent. Once or twice  Silvia looked at her tall companion. She was frankly curious about the  Paris case, but something in the quiet, self-contained face of the man  beside her did not invite questions. On his part, John Earl was asking  himself why he should have given his confidence to this comparative  stranger, and the longer he thought about it the less able was he to  answer his question.          CHAPTER VIII    THE OMNIPRESENT EYES OF FIFTH AVENUE      The source of gossip in a village is the corner grocery store; in a  small city, what goes on about the public square; in the medium-sized  city, what transpires in the leading cafe; in New York, Fifth Avenue and  Central Park are the all-abounding sources of gossip. The Avenue has a  thousand curious eyes; those on the sidewalk peering into automobiles  and carriages for sensations; those being whirled along in vehicles,  straining their power in the quest of salacious information among the  throng beyond the curbstone. All New York passes along Fifth Avenue at  some time or another. All of one's friends are always passing along that  way when one does not particularly wish to be seen by them. If one is  walking, the friends are invariably driving; if one is driving, of  course the ubiquitous acquaintances are out for a stroll. Sometimes  people have been known to escape two-thirds of the omnipresent eyes that  line the sidewalks, pack the Avenue and infest the highways of Central  Park, but no person has ever been heard of who escaped all of them.    So the lot of our strollers was but the common lot of all, visitors as  well as resident New Yorkers.    While mutually absorbed, the one in reciting the tale, the other in  listening to it; while diverted and interested by the thousand sparks  that radiate from the batteries of youthful energy and enthusiasm and  tingle the sensibilities of a congenial comrade; while speculating on  the unknown vista from peep-holes that show only fragments, but  realizing all the vastness and richness of the world force and universal  sympathy possessed by each of them--it is not strange that in four  blocks on the Avenue they were passed by two ladies in an automobile,  who took more than an ordinary interest in their movements, and by a  dark-eyed, dark-haired man in another car, whose eyes gleamed and whose  cheeks blanched at the sight of their absorption in each other.    But the things garnered on the Avenue are never placed in cold storage,  and soon enough both of them were to hear about this stroll.    When Dr. Earl called that evening to take Mrs. and Miss Kimball to the  theatre he discovered that his reception in the morning had been  tropical compared to this one. He was compelled to wait fully fifteen  minutes before Miss Kimball appeared in house gown and slippers,  indicating her purpose to remain at home, and the bearer of a message  that her mother begged to be excused, as she had retired with a sick  headache.    In vain he sought for a reason for his frigid reception, and feeling  that his presence was an affliction he arose to go.    \"I hope you had a pleasant stroll this afternoon,\" came in icicle tones.    This shed all the light necessary upon the character of his greeting.    The eyes of Fifth Avenue had not grown dim.    \"Yes,\" he replied, looking at her steadily, \"it was a most delightful  stroll.\"    She could stand the strain no longer; she came close to him and he  stooped and tenderly kissed her.    \"Oh, Jack, why do you persist in having anything to do with her when  you know how unhappy it makes me!\" she said in her gentlest tone.    They sat down and he related the entire story of the occurrences of the  afternoon to her. It pacified her to a degree.    \"But Jack, dear, you will promise me never to see her again, will you  not?\" and her tone was pleading now.    \"I promised to go with my brother to a suffrage meeting she is holding  Thursday night. Of course _you_ would not wish to go, and I am certain  you do not want me to break my promise.\"    \"I am certain,\" she said, emphasizing each word, \"that I do not want you  to see her again.\"    \"Let me understand you, Leonora, dear. There are many prominent New York  women in this suffrage movement. Some of my very best old-time friends,  I am informed, are participating in it. Is it your desire that I shall  cut their acquaintance also, or is it just Miss Holland you want me  never to see again?\"    \"Now, don't think I am jealous of her, for I am not. She is the most  conspicuous one in this suffrage movement on account of the awful  things she does, but I don't care to associate with any person who is  identified with this crusade. Neither does my mother, nor any of our  social set, and of course I would like you to feel the same way.\"    \"But suppose I do not feel that way. Suppose my sympathies are with them  and my profession as well as my political predilections should carry me  among them?\" he asked earnestly.    \"Oh, Jack, what has come over you that you are so plebeian! Can't you  see how these women are cheapening New York society, associating with  workingmen and shop girls!\"    \"But that is what they should do in a democracy, and I am sure I never  saw better-looking women in my life than these same busy suffragists.  They have something to do, and are not dying of _ennui_ or  listlessness,\" he answered.    \"Their stock argument,\" she answered, \"but whoever heard of an  aristocracy based on such things as these women engage in. Promise me,  Jack, that you will have nothing to do with any of them.\"    \"You are unduly wrought up to-night,\" he answered, \"but I will promise  you that I shall do nothing to cause you unnecessary annoyance. You  must not be too captious, dear, and remember that I go Thursday night.\"    She started to protest, but he drowned the effort in a shower of  caresses and bade her goodnight. Each of them, in the silence of their  own apartments, thought long and earnestly of this interview. Leonora  Kimball had been taught to believe that the chief badges of an  aristocracy were complete idleness of the women, and the possession of  enough wealth to support such idleness. It mattered not how mentally  insipid or morally opaque or physically inane such women might be, the  true test of being fitted for the purple was whether or not they had  ever done any useful work, and whether or not they had money enough so  that the other members of their set might feel assured that they never  would do any useful work. An aristocracy of trained brains or unselfish  culture were meaningless terms to her.    But this night she was greatly disturbed over the attitude of the man  she was to marry. She had been quite honest with him when she asserted  that jealousy was foreign to her nature; affection did not run deep  enough with her to strike its eternal renewing fountain--jealousy. The  practical character with which she had been endowed easily enough  conducted affairs of the heart along paths directed by the head, and  while her professions of love were quite sincere and her loyalty beyond  question, yet she had not the remotest idea of the grand passion. She  knew that she was very fond of John Earl; that he was worthy of her;  that he could sustain her manner of life and that his social standing  was all that either she or her mother could desire. She also knew that  she did not wish to lose him, and much as she abhorred the suffragists,  she determined to be lenient with his present mood, certain she could  change it ere long, else of what avail was the all-powerful \"silent  influence\" upon which the Anti-Suffragists laid so much stress?    Earl was more than disturbed by her attitude, for he discovered traits  of character and a shallowness of sympathy that shocked him. His dream  of married bliss was the absolute _camaraderie_ he expected it to bring.  He feared now that she would not enter into his life or ambitions, and,  like too many of his married acquaintances, they would be seeking  happiness along diverse paths.    \"However, it's all very new to her,\" he said to himself after an hour's  reverie, \"and she is quite young. A few weeks will properly adjust our  relations.\"    The dominant characteristic of this young man was a deep sense of  justice, and while other feelings were all too manifest in his  subconscious being, he permitted himself only to try to solve the  problem of what was the right thing along the lines where he had cast  his future.
