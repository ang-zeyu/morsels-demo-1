We have fallen into German ways--alarming thought!--and become  unquestionably alive to the virtues of cafes and Restaurations as a  wind-up to a day's expedition. At Mainz we discovered a cafe close to  the theatre, and sipped coffee and ate _Streuselkuchen_ out of doors  in the shadow of the cathedral and Gutenberg's statue. A  pleasant-faced Gretchen brought us miniature Mont Blancs of whipped  cream on small glass plates, and loitered near us ostensibly  rearranging a table, but in reality studying our gowns and hats.  Before we paid our Rechnung, the Haushaelterin and Frau Rittergutsbesitzer  turned up hot and rather cross, having spent their time since we  parted in futile attempts to match Schleswig-Holstein ribbons with  those of the sunny Rhineland.                                       SCHLANGENBAD.                         GREEN HILLS AND BLUE WATERS.      Schlangenbad, although a charmingly pretty spot, is not one to  fascinate a painter. The landscape is unvaryingly green, and that  green is too monotonous in tone for effect in a picture. Moreover, it  lies shut in by hills, and there is no distant horizon to give the  value of foreground and middle distance. But less critical eyes find  much to admire in Schlangenbad. The great wide road leading to it from  Eltville testifies to its former popularity in the days of family  coaches and postilions. Nowadays an ugly steam tram transports the  traveller from the Rhine to the \"Serpent's Bath,\" and nearly poisons  and chokes him _en route_ with the horrible smoke it emits. Half of  the tram is open to the air at the sides, like a char-a-banc; and when  we travelled by it a little party of Germans were enjoying an  _Ausflug_, each man with one eye cocked on the scenery and the other  on the look-out for a _Bier-garten_.    Next to me sat a student, whose face was so slashed and gashed that it  reminded one of \"Amtshauptmann Weber\" (in Reuter's delightful book),  whose \"face looked as if he had sat down upon it on a cane-bottomed  chair.\" Opposite the student was a middle-aged fat \"Assessor,\" with a  small girl in long frilled drawers and short petticoats; and on the  other side of the gangway were two homely-looking women in  lead-coloured garments. As we passed through Altdorf the child drew  her father's attention to a fat goose which waddled away as the tram  approached. \"_Sieh mal, Vater_,\" said she, \"_die schoene Gans_.\"  (\"Look, father, at the beautiful goose.\") \"O! _die Gans_,\" said her  practical and prosaic parent, \"_wird viel schoener sein, mein Kind,  wenn sie gebraten ist_.\" (\"The goose will be much more beautiful, my  child, when it is roast.\") \"And has an accompaniment of sage-stuffing  and apple-sauce,\" I added, to which he in all serious conviction bowed  an assent.    The valley up which we journeyed was green and pleasant. There were no  walls or fences on either side of the road, but trees shaded the  wayfarer, and his outlook on gardens, bean-poles, orchards, and vines  was agreeable enough. If he chose to look further afield a silvery  streak called the Rhine was visible, and beyond that again low blue  hills stretched away until their cobalt and that of the sky got mixed  on the palette of Nature. From this valley comes the famous  Rauen-thaler wine. Most of the hills, indeed, are covered with vines,  and the village houses showed grapes hanging from their eaves and  peeping in at their windows.    At Neudorf we paused to pick up a _Barmherzige Schwester_; and as our  halt was exactly in front of the village shop I amused myself by  making a mental inventory of its contents. The window--an ordinary  one--had wooden shelves nailed across it; and on these were displayed  soap, slates and slate-pencils, bottles of peppermint lozenges,  hearthstone, flannel, lemon-drops, gingham, sausages, and gingerbread.    The houses of the village were covered with rough stucco, and white or  yellow-wash was swished liberally over them. Under their deep eaves an  occasional small image of _Die Mutter Gottes_ was to be seen. Many  were covered with grape-vines, and all had clean muslin blinds at  their windows, and often pots of geraniums and fuchsias outside.  Sunflowers, dahlias, and roses grew in the little patches of garden by  the road; and all was charming and primitive, save for the discordant  electric fittings which hung midway on the telegraph-posts, and the  anomaly of a brand new brick _Brod-fabrik_ just outside the village.    All the way up the \"cane-bottomed chair\" and the \"Assessor\" smoked  stolidly, while their women-folk cackled like human geese. \"_Wie  schoen!_\" \"_Colossal!_\" \"_Entzueckend!_\" \"_Reizend!_\" Nothing but  incessant and weary adjectives! I turned with relief to the  \"Barmherzige Schwester,\" a prim and silent little figure in neat blue  cotton gown, black apron, and white kerchief pinned over her shining  hair.    The tram stopped at last before the village church, and we all got  out. To our left, as we faced the Kurhaus, straggled a long line of  houses with deep verandahs and balconies, to our right shady walks and  bath-houses and beautiful woods. Here and there amid the hotels and  villas was a shop, and we knew that Schlangenbad marched with the  times when we saw the word \"_Schamponieren_\" and a bunch of Empire  curls exhibited as a modern trophy. We stopped at a shop and examined  its wares, which, indeed, hung chiefly on the shutters. There were  Swiss embroidered gowns and blouses to be bought, edelweiss penwipers,  wooden paper-cutters, and clocks with chamois climbing wooden rocks.  Nothing apparently in that shop had been \"made in Germany.\" When we  reached the verandah of the \"Nassauer Hof\" we were gladdened by bows  from the \"Assessor\" and the student, who with the \"cackling geese\"  were seated at a long table consuming piles of Apfelkuchen,  Streuselkuchen, and Napfkuchen to an accompaniment of steaming coffee.    As for dull, useful information Schlangenbad, of course, was known to  the Romans, and they bathed in its waters. The Middle Ages seem to  have neglected Spas generally, and to have been dead to the joys of a  bath. At all events, nothing more was heard about Schlangenbad or its  springs until in 1687 a wooden hut was put over what was known as the  \"Roemer Bad.\" Next the Landgraf of Hesse awoke to the virtues of its  waters, and caused the \"Oberes Kurhaus\" to be built. Five years  later, the \"Nassauer Hof\" was erected, and a time of prosperity and  fashion set in for Schlangenbad. The waters have always had a great  reputation for beautifying the skin and healing wounds and sores. It  is on record that Frederick the First of Sweden ordered four thousand  bottles of Schlangenbad water a year as _eau de toilette_, and another  and still vainer sovereign three hundred a week. After this who shall  dare say that women have the monopoly of vanity?    Besides embellishing, the Schlangenbad waters are good in nervous  disorders, rheumatism, and asthma. They are of an exquisite light-blue  colour, and when bathing in them one's limbs have the appearance of  marble. That the Schlangenbad people think highly of their \"cure\" is  obvious. I bought a map of the district (manufactured in the place)  and found the word Schlangenbad printed in huge letters, while the  neighbouring town of Wiesbaden was in such small ones that it looked  as if scarcely worth mentioning at all.                                       LIEBENSTEIN.      Here in the Thuringian Forest, aloof from the stir and roar of life,  lies a Kur-Ort little known to the English world. Its waters are  analogous to those of Schwalbach, its air is as pure, its scenery more  beautiful, and its prices half those of the Taunus Wald. Its people  still retain their primitive charm, unspoilt as yet by the  potentialities of South African or American money-bags. Within easy  reach of such interesting towns as Eisenach, Weimar, Erfurt, Gotha,  and Coburg, it offers many alluring baits to the sightseer; yet to the  coming and going of tourists is it altogether unaccustomed.  Liebenstein lies in a green and beautiful valley, and the hills which  surround it are covered for the most part with great black forests.  Patches of wheat and rye vibrate in the winds which sweep up the  valleys, and the fields of potatoes alternate on the low grounds with  pasturage and orchards. Under the great limestone rocks, which near  Liebenstein rise sheer out of the plain, nestle charming villages, and  long avenues of poplars conduct you where you would go along the high  roads. By the roadside a wealth of flowers is yours for the  picking--wild thyme and asparagus and mallow, periwinkles, and the  picturesque dock and crowfoot. The woods are starred with flowers, and  the perfume of the pines is a revelation.    The humbler houses of Liebenstein (for the greater part timber-framed  and red-tiled) straggle up the immediate hills which surround it.  Those of more pretention and inevitable ugliness range themselves  decently and in order along two parallel roads. Aloof as this village  is from \"the madding crowd's ignoble strife,\" it has yet been touched  to its undoing by the ruthless finger of conventionality. The  inevitable Kur-Haus and bandstand and Anlagen are here; worst of all,  a Trink-Halle! The Trink-Halle stands a mute and awful warning to the  vaulting ambition which overleaps itself, since a classic temple in  the heart of Liebenstein is surely as much out of place as a tiara  would be on the head of the peasant woman who hands you your daily  portion of Stahlwasser. Even the spring it originally sheltered has  revolted against its sham marble pillars and grotesque entablature,  and betaken itself elsewhere! Nowadays the paint and plaster are  peeling off the columns, and its door is padlocked.

Potiphar left all  that he had in Joseph's charge, and he knew nothing about his affairs  except about the food which he ate. And Joseph was handsome and  attractive.    After these honors had come to Joseph, his master's wife tried to tempt  him to be unfaithful to his trust. But he refused, saying to her, \"See,  my master knows nothing about what I do in the house, and he has put all  that he has in my charge. How then can I do this great wrong and sin  against God?\" Day after day she tempted Joseph, but he did not listen to  her. One day, however, when he went into the house to do his work and  when none of the men of the household were at home, she caught hold of  his garment and again tried to tempt him, but he left his garment in her  hand and fled out of the house.    She kept his garment by her until his master came home; then she said to  him, \"The Hebrew slave whom you have brought to us came to me to insult  me; and when I cried aloud, he left his garment with me and fled.\"    When Joseph's master heard what his wife said to him, he was very angry;  and he took Joseph and put him into the prison, in the place where the  king's prisoners were kept. So he was left there in prison. But Jehovah  was with Joseph and showed kindness to him and helped him to win the  friendship of the keeper of the prison, so that he placed all the  prisoners in Joseph's charge and made him responsible for whatever they  did there.    After these things the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker  offended their master the king of Egypt, and Pharaoh was so angry with  these two officers that he put them in the same prison where Joseph was.  And the captain of the guard appointed Joseph to wait on them; and they  stayed in prison for some time.    And the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were in the  prison, both had dreams the same night, each with a different meaning.  When Joseph came in to them in the morning, he saw plainly that they  were sad. So he asked Pharaoh's officers, \"Why do you look so sad  to-day?\" They answered, \"We have had a dream, and there is no one who  can tell what it means.\" Then Joseph said to them, \"Is not God the one  who knows what dreams mean? Tell them to me, if you will.\"    Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him, \"In my  dream I saw a vine before me, and on the vine were three branches, and  the buds put out blossoms, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.  Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed the  juice into his cup and gave the cup to Pharaoh.\"    Then Joseph said to him, \"This is what it means: the three branches are  three days. Within three days Pharaoh will let you out of prison and  restore you to your office, and you will give Pharaoh's cup into his  hand as you used to do when you were his butler. But when all goes well  with you, remember me, show kindness to me and speak for me to Pharaoh  and bring me out of this prison; for I was unjustly stolen from the land  of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put  me in the dungeon.\"    When the chief baker saw that the meaning of the butler's dream was  good, he said to Joseph, \"I also saw something in my dream: there were  three baskets of white bread on my head, and in the upper basket there  were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them  out of the basket on my head.\" Joseph answered, \"This is what it means:  the three baskets are three days; within three days Pharaoh will take  off your head and hang you on a tree, and the birds shall eat your  flesh.\"    Now on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for  all his servants. Then he set free the chief butler and the chief baker.  He restored the chief butler to his office, so that he again gave the  cup to Pharaoh; but the chief baker he hanged, as Joseph had told them.  Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.      A PRISONER WHO BECAME A MIGHTY RULER    Two years later Pharaoh had a dream: as he stood by the river Nile, he  saw coming up from the water seven cows, well fed and fat, for they had  been feeding in the river grass. Then seven other cows came up after  them out of the Nile, poorly fed and thin, and they stood by the other  cows on the bank of the Nile. The poorly fed, lean cows ate up the seven  well-fed, fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.    Afterward he slept and had a second dream and saw seven ears, plump and  good, growing up on one stalk. Also seven ears, thin and withered by the  east wind, grew up after them. The thin ears swallowed up the seven  plump, full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and knew that it was only a dream.    In the morning Pharaoh was worried. So he sent for all the magicians and  wise men of Egypt and told them his dreams; but no one could tell him  what they meant.    Then the chief butler said to Pharaoh, \"I now remember my sins: Pharaoh  was very angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in  prison in the house of the captain of the guard. We both had dreams the  same night, each with a different meaning. There was also with us a  young Hebrew, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our  dreams and he told each of us what our dreams meant. And our dreams came  true just as he said they would: I was restored to my office, but the  chief baker was hanged.\"    Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the  dungeon; and he shaved his face, changed his clothes, and came to  Pharaoh. Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I have had a dream, and there is no  one who can tell what it means. Now I have heard that when you hear a  dream, you can tell what it means.\" Joseph answered Pharaoh, \"Not I; God  alone can give Pharaoh a true answer.\"    Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"In my dream as I stood on the bank of the  Nile, I saw seven cows, fat and well fed, which had been feeding in the  river grass. There came up after them seven more cows, poorly fed and  thin, worse than I ever saw in all the land of Egypt; and the lean and  poorly fed cows ate up the first seven fat cows. When they had eaten  them up, one could not tell that they had eaten them, for they were  still as thin as at the beginning. Then I awoke.    \"Again I dreamed and saw seven ears, plump and good, grow up on one  stalk; then seven thin ears, withered with the east wind, sprang up  after them; and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I have  told the dream to the magicians, but there is no one who can tell me  what it means.\"    Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, \"Pharaoh's two dreams mean the same thing;  God has made known to Pharaoh what he is about to do. The seven good  cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years. It is one  dream. The seven lean and poorly fed cows that came up after them are  seven years, and the seven empty ears withered with the east wind mean  seven years of famine. That is why I said to Pharaoh, 'God has shown to  Pharaoh what he is about to do.' Seven years of great plenty all through  the land of Egypt are coming. They shall be followed by seven years of  famine, so that all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt.  The famine will use up all that the land produces; and plenty will not  be known in the land because of that famine which follows, for it will  be very severe.    \"The dream came twice to Pharaoh to show that the famine will surely  come, and that God will soon make the dream come true. Now therefore let  Pharaoh pick out a man who is sensible and wise and place him in charge  of the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh act quickly and put overseers over the  land and collect one-fifth of all that grows in the land of Egypt in the  seven years of plenty. Let them gather all the food of these good years  that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and  let them hold it in the cities for food. The food will supply the land  during the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, so  that the people of the land may not die because of the famine.\"    The plan pleased Pharaoh and all his people; and he said to his people,  \"Can we find one like this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?\" So  Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"As God has shown you all this, there is no one  so sensible and wise as you. You shall be at the head of my country, and  all my people shall be ruled as you command. Only on the throne I will  be above you.\"    So Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"See, I have placed you over all the land of  Egypt.\" And Pharaoh took off his signet-ring from his finger and put it  upon Joseph's finger and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a  golden collar about his neck. He also made him ride in the second  chariot which he had; and they cried before him, \"Attention!\" So he  placed him over all the land of Egypt. Pharaoh also said to Joseph, \"I  am Pharaoh, but without your consent no man shall lift up his hand or  his foot in all the land of Egypt.\" Pharaoh gave him as a wife Asenath,  the daughter of Potiphera. And Joseph was thirty years old when he was  made the ruler of the land of Egypt.    In the seven years of plenty there were large harvests, and Joseph  gathered up all the food of the seven years of plenty, which were in the  land of Egypt, and stored the food in the cities, putting in each city  the food that grew in the fields about it. Joseph stored up grain as the  sand of the sea, in great quantities, until he no longer kept account,  because it could not be measured.    When the seven years of plenty in the land of Egypt were over, the seven  years of famine began, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all  lands, but all through the land of Egypt there was food, for when all  the land of Egypt was hungry, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and  Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, \"Go to Joseph and do what he tells  you.\" So when the famine was over"]]]
