[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#9)"],[1,";       The question about Joachim;       The-state of my house;       The people of my suite;       Subject of my arrival;       Joseph;       Conversation between him and me;       His desire to please me and his repentance;       The explanation of his letter;       Mr. Livingston.    \"Ah! I was forgetting that. Yesterday Livingston during supper told de  Rere in a low voice to drink to the health of one I knew well, and to  beg me to do him the honour. After supper, as I was leaning on his  shoulder near the fire, he said to me, 'Is it not true that there are  visits very agreeable for those who pay them and those who receive them?  But, however satisfied they seem with your arrival, I challenge their  delight to equal the grief of one whom you have left alone to-day, and  who will never be content till he sees you again.' I asked him of whom  he wished to speak to me. He then answered me by pressing my arm: 'Of  one of those who have not followed you; and among those it is easy for  you to guess of whom I want to speak.'    \"I have worked till two o'clock at the bracelet; I have enclosed a  little key which is attached by two strings: it is not as well worked as  I should like, but I have not had time to make it better; I will make  you a finer one on the first occasion. Take care that it is not seen on  you; for I have worked at it before everyone, and it would be recognised  to a certainty.    \"I always return, in spite of myself, to the frightful attempt that you  advise. You compel me to concealments, and above all to treacheries that  make me shudder; I would rather die, believe me, than do such things;  for it makes my heart bleed. He does not want to follow me unless I  promise him to have the selfsame bed and board with him as before, and  not to abandon him so often. If I consent to it, he says he will do all  I wish, and will follow me everywhere; but he has begged me to put off  my departure for two days. I have pretended to agree to all he wishes;  but I have told him not to speak of our reconciliation to anyone, for  fear it should make some lords uneasy. At last I shall take him  everywhere I wish.... Alas! I have never deceived anyone; but what would  I not do to please you? Command, and whatever happens, I shall obey. But  see yourself if one could not contrive some secret means in the shape of  a remedy. He must purge himself at Craigmiller and take baths there; he  will be some days without going out. So far as I can see, he is very  uneasy; but he has great trust in what I tell him: however, his  confidence does not go so far as to allow him to open his mind to me. If  you like, I will tell him every thing: I can have no pleasure in  deceiving someone who is trusting. However, it will be just as you wish:  do not esteem me the less for that. It is you advised it; never would  vengeance have taken me so far. Sometimes he attacks me in a very  sensitive place, and he touches me to the quick when he tells me that  his crimes are known, but that every day greater ones are committed that  one uselessly attempts to hide, since all crimes, whatsoever they be,  great or small, come to men's knowledge and form the common subject of  their discourse. He adds sometimes, in speaking to me of Madame de Rere,  'I wish her services may do you honour.' He has assured me that many  people thought, and that he thought himself, that I was not my own  mistress; this is doubtless because I had rejected the conditions he  offered me. Finally, it is certain that he is very uneasy about you know  what, and that he even suspects that his life is aimed at. He is in  despair whenever the conversation turns on you, Livingston, and my  brother. However, he says neither good nor ill of absent people; but, on  the contrary, he always avoids speaking of them. His father keeps to the  house: I have not seen him yet. A number of the Hamiltons are here, and  accompany me everywhere; all the friends of the other one follow me each  time I go to see him. He has begged me to be at his rising to-morrow. My  messenger will tell you the rest.    \"Burn my letter: there would be danger in keeping it. Besides, it is  hardly worth the trouble, being filled only with dark thoughts.    \"As for you, do not be offended if I am sad and uneasy to-day, that to  please you I rise above honour, remorse, and dangers. Do not take in bad  part what I tell you, and do not listen to the malicious explanations of  your wife's brother; he is a knave whom you ought not to hear to the  prejudice of the most tender and most faithful mistress that ever was.  Above all, do not allow yourself to be moved by that woman: her sham  tears are nothing in comparison with the real tears that I shed, and  with what love and constancy make me suffer at succeeding her; it is for  that alone that in spite of myself I betray all those who could cross my  love. God have mercy on me, and send you all the prosperity that a  humble and tender friend who awaits from you soon another reward wishes  you. It is very late; but it is always with regret that I lay down my  pen when I write to you; however, I shall not end my letter until I  shall have kissed your hands. Forgive me that it is so ill-written:  perhaps I do so expressly that you may be obliged to re-read it several  times: I have transcribed hastily what I had written down on my tablets,  and my paper has given out. Remember a tender friend, and write to her  often: love me as tenderly as I love you, and remember:        \"Madame de Rere's words;       The English;       His mother;       The Earl of Argyll;       The Earl of Bothwell;       The Edinburgh dwelling.\"    SECOND LETTER    \"It seems that you have forgotten me during your absence, so much the  more that you had promised me, at setting out, to let me know in detail  everything fresh that should happen. The hope of receiving your news was  giving me almost as much delight as your return could have brought me:  you have put it off longer than you promised me. As for me, although you  do not write, I play my part always. I shall take him to Craigmiller on  Monday, and he will spend the whole of Wednesday there. On that day I  shall go to Edinburgh to be bled there, unless you arrange otherwise at  least. He is more cheerful than usual, and he is better than ever.    \"He says everything he can to persuade me that he loves me; he has a  thousand attentions for me, and he anticipates me in everything: all  that is so pleasant for me, that I never go to him but the pain in my  side comes on again, his company weighs on me so much. If Paris brought  me what I asked him, I should be soon cured. If you have not yet  returned when I go you know where, write to me, I beg you, and tell me  what you wish me to do; for if you do not manage things prudently, I  foresee that the whole burden will fall on me: look into everything and  weigh the affair maturely. I send you my letter by Beaton, who will set  out the day which has been assigned to Balfour. It only remains for me  to beg you to inform me of your journey.    \"Glasgow, this Saturday morning.\"    THIRD LETTER    \"I stayed you know where longer than I should have done, if it had not  been to get from him something that the bearer of these presents will  tell you it was a good opportunity for covering up our designs: I have  promised him to bring the person you know to-morrow. Look after the  rest, if you think fit. Alas! I have failed in our agreement, for you  have forbidden me to write to you, or to despatch a messenger to you.  However, I do not intend to offend you: if you knew with what fears I am  agitated, you would not have yourself so many doubts and suspicions. But  I take them in good part, persuaded as I am that they have no other  cause than love--love that I esteem more than anything on earth.    \"My feelings and my favours are to me sure warrants for that love, and  answer to me for your heart; my trust is entire on this head: but  explain yourself, I entreat you, and open your soul to me; otherwise, I  shall fear lest, by the fatality of my star, and by the too fortunate  influence of the stars on women less tender and less faithful than I, I  may be supplanted in your heart as Medea was in Jason's; not that I wish  to compare you to a lover as unfortunate as Jason, and to parallel  myself with a monster like Medea, although you have enough influence  over me to force me to resemble her each time our love exacts it, and  that it concerns me to keep your heart, which belongs to me, and which  belongs to me only. For I name as belonging to me what I have purchased  with the tender and constant love with which I have burned for you, a  love more alive to-day than ever, and which will end only with my life;  a love, in short, which makes me despise both the dangers and the  remorse which will be perhaps its sad sequel. As the price of this  sacrifice, I ask you but one favour, it is to remember a spot not far  from here: I do not exact that you should keep your promise to-morrow;  but I want to see you to disperse your suspicions. I ask of God only one  thing: it is that He should make you read my heart, which is less mine  than yours, and that He should guard you from every ill, at least during  my life: this life is dear to me only in so far as it pleases you, and  as I please you myself. I am going to bed: adieu; give me your news  to-morrow morning; for I shall be uneasy till I have it. Like a bird  escaped from its cage, or the turtle-dove which has lost her mate, I  shall be alone, weeping your absence, short as it may be. This letter,  happier than I, will go this evening where I cannot go, provided that  the messenger does not find you asleep, as I fear. I have not dared to  write it in the presence of Joseph, of Sebastian, and of Joachim, who  had only just left me when I began it.\"    Thus, as one sees, and always supposing these letters to be genuine,  Mary had conceived for Bothwell"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2745"],[0,"Karl Ludwig Sand (#9)"],[1,"of the farewell when the  moment came to part in this world. Let us therefore abide by the  sacrifice, according to God's will, and let us yield ourselves only to  that sweet community of thought which distance cannot interrupt, in  which I find my only joys, and which, in spite of men, will always be  granted us by the Lord, our Father.    \"As for my physical state, I knew nothing about it. You see, however,  since at last I am writing to you myself, that I have come past my first  uncertainties. As for the rest, I know too little of the structure of my  own body to give any opinion as to what my wounds may determine for it.  Except that a little strength has returned to me, its state is still the  same, and I endure it calmly and patiently; for God comes to my help,  and gives me courage and firmness. He will help me, believe me, to find  all the joys of the soul and to be strong in mind. Amen.    \"May you live happy!--Your deeply respectful son, \"KARL-LUDWIG SAND.\"    A month after this letter came tender answers from all the family. We  will quote only that of Sand's mother, because it completes the idea  which the reader may have formed already of this great-hearted woman, as  her son always calls her.    \"DEAR, INEXPRESSIBLY DEAR KARL,--How Sweet it was to me to see the  writing of your beloved hand after so long a time! No journey would have  been so painful and no road so long as to prevent me from coming to you,  and I would go, in deep and infinite love, to any end of the earth in  the mere hope of catching sight of you.    \"But, as I well know both your tender affection and your profound  anxiety for me, and as you give me, so firmly and upon such manly  reflection, reasons against which I can say nothing, and which I can but  honour, it shall be, my well-beloved Karl, as you have wished and  decided. We will continue, without speech, to communicate our thoughts;  but be satisfied, nothing can separate us; I enfold you in my soul, and  my material thoughts watch over you.    \"May this infinite love which upholds us, strengthens us, and leads us  all to a better life, preserve, dear Karl, your courage and firmness.    \"Farewell, and be invariably assured that I shall never cease to love  you strongly and deeply.    \"Your faithful mother, who loves you to eternity.\"    Sand replied:--    January 1820, from my isle of Patmos. \"MY DEAR PARENTS, BROTHERS, AND  SISTERS,--    \"In the middle of the month of September last year I received, through  the grand-duke's special commission of inquiry, whose humanity you have  already appreciated, your dear letters of the end of August and the  beginning of September, which had such magical influence that they  inundated me with joy by transporting me into the inmost circle of your  hearts.    \"You, my tender father, you write to me on the sixty-seventh anniversary  of your birth, and you bless me by the outpouring of your most tender  love.    \"You, my well-beloved mother, you deign to promise the continuance of  your maternal affection, in which I have at all times constantly  believed; and thus I have received the blessings of both of you, which,  in my present position, will exercise a more beneficent influence upon  me than any of the things that all the kings of the earth, united  together, could grant me. Yes, you strengthen me abundantly by your  blessed love, and I render thanks to you, my beloved parents, with that  respectful submission that my heart will always inculcate as the first  duty of a son.    \"But the greater your love and the more affectionate your letters, the  more do I suffer, I must acknowledge, from the voluntary sacrifice that  we have imposed upon ourselves in not seeing one another; and the only  reason, my dear parents, why I have delayed to reply to you, was to give  myself time to recover the strength which I have lost.    \"You too, dear brother-in-law and dear sister, assure me of your sincere  and uninterrupted attachment. And yet, after the fright that I have  spread among you all, you seem not to know exactly what to think of me;  but my heart, full of gratitude for your past kindness, comforts itself;  for your actions speak and tell me that, even if you wished no longer to  love me as I love you, you would not be able to do otherwise. These  actions mean more to me at this hour than any possible protestations,  nay, than even the tenderest words.    \"And you also, my kind brother, you would have consented to hurry with  our beloved mother to the shores of the Rhine, to this place where the  real links of the soul were welded between us, where we were doubly  brothers; but tell me, are you not really here, in thought and in  spirit, when I consider the rich fountain of consolation brought me by  your cordial and tender letter?    \"And, you, kind sister-in-law, as you showed yourself from the first, in  your delicate tenderness, a true sister, so I find you again at present.  There are still the same tender relations, still the same sisterly  affection; your consolations, which emanate from a deep and submissive  piety, have fallen refreshingly into the depths of my heart. But, dear  sister-in-law, I must tell you, as well as the others, that you are too  liberal towards me in dispensing your esteem and praises, and your  exaggeration has cast me back face to face with my inmost judge, who has  shown me in the mirror of my conscience the image of my every weakness.    \"You, kind Julia, you desire nothing else but to save me from the fate  that awaits me; and you assure me in your own name and in that of you  all, that you, like the others, would rejoice to endure it in my place;  in that I recognise you fully, and I recognise, too, those sweet and  tender relations in which we have been brought up from childhood. Oh, be  comforted, dear Julia; thanks to the protection of God, I promise you:  that it will be easy for me, much easier than I should have thought, to  bear what falls to my lot. Receive, then, all of you, my warm and  sincere thanks for having thus rejoiced my heart.    \"Now that I know from these strengthening letters that, like the  prodigal son, the love and goodness of my family are greater on my  return than at my departure, I will, as carefully as possible, paint for  you my physical and moral state, and I pray God to supplement my words  by His strength, so that my letter may contain an equivalent of what  yours brought to me, and may help you to reach that state of calm and  serenity to which I have myself attained.    \"Hardened, by having gained power over myself, against the good and ill  of this earth, you knew already that of late years I have lived only for  moral joys, and I must say that, touched by my efforts, doubtless, the  Lord, who is the sacred fount of all that is good, has rendered me apt  in seeking them and in tasting them to the full. God is ever near me, as  formerly, and I find in Him the sovereign principle of the creation of  all things; in Him, our holy Father, not only consolation and strength,  but an unalterable Friend, full of the holiest love, who will accompany  me in all places where I may need His consolations. Assuredly, if He had  turned from me, or if I had turned away my eyes from Him, I should now  find myself very unfortunate and wretched; but by His grace, on the  contrary, lowly and weak creature as I am, He makes me strong and  powerful against whatever can befall me.    \"What I have hitherto revered as sacred, what I have desired as good  what I have aspired to as heavenly, has in no respect changed now. And I  thank God for it, for I should now be in great despair if I were  compelled to recognise that my heart had adored deceptive images and  enwrapped itself in fugitive chimeras. Thus my faith in these ideas and  my pure love far them, guardian angels of my spirit as they are,  increase moment by moment, and will go on increasing to my end, and I  hope that I may pass all the more easily from this world into eternity.  I pass my silent life in Christian exaltation and humility, and I  sometimes have those visions from above through which I have, from my  birth, adored heaven upon earth, and which give me power to raise myself  to the Lord upon the eager wings of my prayers. My illness, though long,  painful, and cruel, has always been sufficiently mastered by my will to  let me busy myself to some result with history, positive sciences, and  the finer parts of religious education, and when my suffering became  more violent and for a time interrupted these occupations, I struggled  successfully, nevertheless, against ennui; for the memories of the past,  my resignation to the present, and my faith in the future were rich  enough and strong enough in me and round me to prevent my falling from  my terrestrial paradise. According to my principles, I would never, in  the position in which I am and in which I have placed myself, have been  willing to ask anything for my own comfort; but so much kindness and  care have been lavished upon me, with so much delicacy and  humanity,--which alas! I am unable to return--by every person with whom  I have been brought into contact, that wishes which I should not have  dared to frame in the mast private recesses of my heart have been more  than exceeded. I have never been so much overcome by bodily pains that I  could not say within myself, while I lifted my thoughts to heaven, 'Come  what may of this ray.' And great as these gains have been, I could not  dream of comparing them with those sufferings of the soul that we feel  so profoundly and poignantly in the recognition of our weaknesses and  faults.    \"Moreover, these pains seldom now cause me to lose consciousness; the  swelling and inflammation never made great headway, and the fever has  always been moderate, though for nearly ten months I have been forced to  remain lying on my back, unable to raise myself, and although more than  forty pints of matter have come from my "]]]
