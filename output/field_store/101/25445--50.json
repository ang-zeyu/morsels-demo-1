The object of inquiry... is chiefly whether a sick person will     recover; for this purpose the nut being placed on the ground, a     relation of the sick person determines that, if the nut, when     again at rest, points to such a quarter, the east for example,     that the sick man will recover; he then prays aloud to the     patron god of the family that he will be pleased to direct the     nut so that it may indicate the truth; the nut being next spun,     the result is attended to with confidence, at least with a full     conviction that it will truly declare the intentions of the gods     at the time (vol. ii. p. 227).    Does not the action of Saul, on a famous occasion, involve exactly the  same theological presuppositions?       Therefore Saul said unto Jahveh, the Elohim of Israel, Shew the     right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot: but the people     escaped. And Saul said, Cast _lots_ between me and Jonathan     my son. And Jonathan was taken. And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell     me what thou hast done.... And the people rescued Jonathan so     that he died not (1 Sam. xiv. 41-45).    As the Israelites had great yearly feasts, so had the Polynesians; as  the Israelites practised circumcision, so did many Polynesian people;  as the Israelites had a complex and often arbitrary-seeming multitude  of distinctions between clean and unclean things, and clean and unclean  states of men, to which they attached great importance, so had the  Polynesians their notions of ceremonial purity and their _tabu,_ an  equally extensive and strange system of prohibitions, violation of which  was visited by death. These doctrines of cleanness and uncleanness no  doubt may have taken their rise in the real or fancied utility of the  prescriptions, but it is probable that the origin of many is indicated  in the curious habit of the Samoans to make fetishes of living animals.  It will be recollected that these people had no \"gods made with hands,\"  but they substituted animals for them.    At his birth    \"every Samoan was supposed to be taken under the care of some tutelary  god or _aitu_ [= Atua] as it was called. The help of perhaps half a  dozen different gods was invoked in succession on the occasion, but the  one who happened to be addressed just as the child was born was marked  and declared to be the child's god for life.    \"These gods were supposed to appear in some _visible incarnation,_ and  the particular thing in which his god was in the habit of appearing was,  to the Samoan, an object of veneration. It was in fact his idol, and  he was careful never to injure it or treat it with contempt. One, for  instance, saw his god in the eel, another in the shark, another in the  turtle, another in the dog, another in the owl, another in the lizard;  and so on, throughout all the fish of the sea and birds and four-footed  beasts and creeping things. In some of the shell-fish even, gods were  supposed to be present. A man would eat freely of what was regarded as  the incarnation of the god of another man, but the incarnation of his  own particular god he would consider it death to injure or eat.\" [23]    We have here that which appears to be the origin, or one of the origins,  of food prohibitions, on the one hand, and of totemism on the other.  When it is remembered that the old Israelites sprang from ancestors who  are said to have resided near, or in, one of the great seats of ancient  Babylonian civilisation, the city of Ur; that they had been, it is said  for centuries, in close contact with the Egyptians; and that, in the  theology of both the Babylonians and the Egyptians, there is abundant  evidence, notwithstanding their advanced social organisation, of the  belief in spirits, with sorcery, ancestor-worship, the deification of  animals, and the converse animalisation of gods--it obviously needs very  strong evidence to justify the belief that the rude tribes of Israel did  not share the notions from which their far more civilised neighbours had  not emancipated themselves.    But it is surely needless to carry the comparison further. Out of the  abundant evidence at command, I think that sufficient has been produced  to furnish ample grounds for the belief, that the old Israelites of the  time of Samuel entertained theological conceptions which were on a level  with those current among the more civilised of the Polynesian islanders,  though their ethical code may possibly, in some respects, have been more  advanced. [24]    A theological system of essentially similar character, exhibiting the  same fundamental conceptions respecting the continued existence  and incessant interference in human affairs of disembodied spirits,  prevails, or formerly prevailed, among the whole of the inhabitants  of the Polynesian and Melanesian islands, and among the people of  Australia, notwithstanding the wide differences in physical character  and in grade of civilisation which obtain among them. And the same  proposition is true of the people who inhabit the riverain shores of the  Pacific Ocean whether Dyaks, Malays, Indo-Chinese, Chinese, Japanese,  the wild tribes of America, or the highly civilised old Mexicans and  Peruvians. It is no less true of the Mongolic nomads of Northern Asia,  of the Asiatic Aryans and of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, and it holds  good among the Dravidians of the Dekhan and the negro tribes of Africa.  No tribe of savages which has yet been discovered, has been conclusively  proved to have so poor a theological equipment as to be devoid of a  belief in ghosts, and in the utility of some form of witchcraft, in  influencing those ghosts. And there is no nation, modern or ancient,  which, even at this moment, has wholly given up the belief; and in which  it has not, at one time or other, played a great part in practical life.    This _sciotheism,_ [25] as it might be called, is found, in several  degrees of complexity, in rough correspondence with the stages of social  organisation, and, like these, separated by no sudden breaks.    In its simplest condition, such as may be met with among the Australian  savages, theology is a mere belief in the existence, powers, and  disposition (usually malignant) of ghostlike entities who may be  propitiated or scared away; but no cult can properly be said to exist.  And, in this stage, theology is wholly independent of ethics. The moral  code, such as is implied by public opinion, derives no sanction from the  theological dogmas, and the influence of the spirits is supposed to be  exerted out of mere caprice or malice.    As a next stage, the fundamental fear of ghosts and the consequent  desire to propitiate them acquire an organised ritual in simple forms of  ancestor-worship, such as the Rev. Mr. Turner describes among the people  of Tanna (_l.c._ p. 88); and this line of development may be followed  out until it attains its acme in the State-theology of China and  the Kami-theology [26] of Japan. Each of these is essentially  ancestor-worship, the ancestors being reckoned back through family  groups, of higher and higher order, sometimes with strict reference to  the principle of agnation, as in old Rome; and, as in the latter, it is  intimately bound up with the whole organisation of the State. There are  no idols; inscribed tablets in China, and strips of paper lodged in a  peculiar portable shrine in Japan, represent the souls of the deceased,  or the special seats which they occupy when sacrifices are offered by  their descendants. In Japan it is interesting to observe that a national  Kami--Ten-zio-dai-zin--is worshipped as a sort of Jahveh by the nation  in general, and (as Lippert has observed) it is singular that his  special seat is a portable litter-like shrine, termed the Mikosi, in  some sort analogous to the Israelitic ark. In China, the emperor is  the representative of the primitive ancestors, and stands, as it were,  between them and the supreme cosmic deities--Heaven and Earth--who are  superadded to them, and who answer to the Tangaloa and the Maui of the  Polynesians.    Sciotheism, under the form of the deification of ancestral ghosts, in  its most pronounced form, is therefore the chief element in the theology  of a great moiety, possibly of more than half, of the human race. I  think this must be taken to be a matter of fact--though various opinions  may be held as to how this ancestor-worship came about. But on the other  hand, it is no less a matter of fact that there are very few people  without additional gods, who cannot, with certainty, be accounted for as  deified ancestors.    With all respect for the distinguished authorities on the other side,  I cannot find good reasons for accepting the theory that the cosmic  deities--who are superadded to deified ancestors even in China; who are  found all over Polynesia, in Tangaloa and Maui, and in old Peru, in the  Sun--are the product either of the \"search after the infinite,\" or of  mistakes arising out of the confusion of a great chief's name with the  thing signified by the name. But, however this may be, I think it is  again merely matter of fact that, among a large portion of mankind,  ancestor-worship is more or less thrown into the background either by  such cosmic deities, or by tribal gods of uncertain origin, who have  been raised to eminence by the superiority in warfare, or otherwise, of  their worshippers.    Among certain nations, the polytheistic theology, thus constituted, has  become modified by the selection of some one cosmic or tribal god, as  the only god to whom worship is due on the part of that nation (though  it is by no means denied that other nations have a right to worship  other gods), and thus results a worship of one God--_monolatry,_ as  Wellhausen calls it--which is very different from genuine monotheism.  [27] In ancestral sciotheism, and in this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],[0,"Our Bird Comrades (#9)"],[1,"    The world over, there are twenty distinct species of nuthatches known  to scientific observers, but only four of them are natives of America.  Of course, there are a number of subspecies or varieties.  All of them  are incessant climbers and foragers, peering into crannies, pounding  here and there to make the grubs stir in their hiding places, jabbing  and prying with their beaks, and chiseling out all kinds of larvae,  grubs, and borers that would, if permitted to live and multiply, soon  devastate the timber and fruit trees and make this world a desert  indeed.  True, the other feathered clamberers and carpenters are fully  as useful, but depend upon it, the nuthatches do their share in  preserving our forests and orchards.    The white-breasted nuthatch is our most common species east of the  great plains, breeding from the Gulf States to the northern border of  the United States and to New Brunswick.  One peculiarity about him is  that he breeds throughout his range, and therefore may be found as both  a summer and winter resident in all suitable localities within these  boundaries.  In the winter, no matter how old Boreas may bluster, he is  one of the most cheerful denizens of the woods in our central  latitudes, calling his nasal \"yank, yank, yank,\" and sometimes  indulging in a loud, half-merry outburst that goes echoing through the  woodlands.  No sound of the sylvan solitudes has a more woodsy flavor  or is more suggestive of vernal cheer and good will.  Sometimes he  chatters to his human visitors in the most cordial tones as he glides  up and down his arboreal promenade, or holds himself almost straight  out.    A hole in a stump or tree makes Madame Nuthatch a cosy nursery, which  she lines with feathers and leaves, making it soft and snug for her  downy brood.  Here they are safe from most of the prowlers that find  the more exposed nests of many other birds.  She deposits five to eight  eggs of a white or creamy-white ground-color, speckled with rufous and  lavender.  During the season of incubation and brood rearing the  nuthatches retire to the depth of the woods, and are quiet, secretive,  and unsocial, seldom betraying their procreant secrets.    These birds have another habit that is worth mentioning.  Having found  a larger supply of food than they require for their immediate use, they  carry morsels away and jam them into all sorts of holes and crannies in  the bark of the trees.  I have watched a pair for an hour diligently  laying by a store of sunflower seeds, which they had found at the edge  of the woods.  They do not store a quantity of provision in one place  like the squirrels, but deposit a tidbit here and there, wedging it  tightly into a crevice by hammering it with their stout bills.  Of  course, the woodpeckers and tomtits secure many of these half-hidden  goodies, but Master Nuthatch does not mind that, for he evens up the  theft by appropriating their stores when he finds them.    The white-breasted nuthatch may be known by his flat body and broad  shoulders, his bluish gray coat, black cap and mantle (all in one  piece), white cravat, shirt bosom and vest, with a few rufous  decorations on the belly and under tail-coverts.  The following  quotations from Wilson are given as much for their vivacious manner as  for the story itself:    \"The male is extremely attentive to the female while sitting, supplying  her regularly with sustenance, stopping frequently at the mouth of the  hole, calling and offering her what he has brought, in the most  endearing manner.  Sometimes he seems to stop merely to inquire how she  is, and to lighten the tedious moments with his soothing chatter.  He  seldom rambles far from the spot, and when danger appears, regardless  of his own safety, he flies instantly to alarm her.  When both are  feeding on the trunk of the same tree, or of adjoining trees, he is  perpetually calling on her; and, from the momentary pause he makes, it  is plain he feels pleased to hear her reply.    \"He rests and roosts with his head downwards; and appears to possess a  degree of curiosity not common in many birds; frequently descending,  very silently, within a few feet of the root of the tree where you  happen to stand, stopping, head downward, stretching out his neck in a  horizontal direction, as if to reconnoiter your appearance, and after  several minutes of silent observation, wheeling around, he again  mounts, with fresh activity, piping his unisons as before...  Sometimes  the rain, freezing as it falls, encloses every twig, and even the trunk  of the tree, in a hard, transparent coat or shell of ice.  On these  occasions I have observed his anxiety and dissatisfaction at being with  difficulty able to make his way along the smooth surface; at these  times he generally abandons the trees, gleans about the stables, around  the house, mixing among the fowls, entering the barn, and examining the  beams and rafters, and every place where he may pick up a subsistence.\"    Our charming white-breast has a little cousin called the red-breasted  nuthatch (_Sitta canadensis_), whose under parts are rufous or reddish  buff instead of white.  His crown and nape are black, then a white band  runs back from the base of the upper mandible to the hind neck, and  below this a black stripe reaches back in a parallel direction and  encloses the eye.  His upper parts, save those mentioned, are bluish  gray.  He is considerably smaller than the white-breast, and his range  is more northerly in summer; but, unlike his cousin, he does not breed  throughout his range; only in the localities which he selects for his  summer home.  Hence he is a migrant, dwelling in winter in the southern  states, and in summer in the latitude of Manitoba and Maine and  northward, and also on the summits of the mountains as far south as  Virginia.  It will be seen that the breeding precincts of the two  species overlap, while in winter _canadensis_ comes down from the north  and takes up his abode in the southern part of the demesne of  _carolinensis_.    While the white-breast is partial to oak, beech, maple, and other  deciduous forests, his little relative prefers a woodland of pine,  being very fond of scampering about on the cones, clinging to them with  his strong claws, and extracting the seeds with his stout little bill.  His call, though much like the \"yank\" of the white-breast, is pitched  to a higher key, and has even a more pronounced nasal intonation,  sounding as if he had taken a severe cold.  Besides, he gives  expression to some cheery notes that seem to be reserved for his own  family or exclusive social circles.  I found these pretty nuthatches in  the pine woods on Mackinac Island in midsummer, and have good reason to  believe that they breed there.    Cavities in trees or stumps furnish the redbreasts with nesting places  suited to their taste; but they have a cunning way of plastering the  entrance above and below with pine pitch, so as to make it just large  enough to admit their tiny bodies and yet too small to let in their  enemies.  In this respect they steal the laurels from their  white-breasted kinsmen, who seem to have no means by which to lessen  the dimensions of their natural doorways.    A still smaller member of this group is the brown-headed nuthatch  (_Sitta pusilla_), a resident of the South Atlantic and Gulf states, at  rare intervals wandering \"accidentally\" as far north as Missouri and  New York.  A daintily dressed little fellow is this bird, the top and  back of his head a dark grayish brown with a whitish patch on the nape,  the remainder of his upper parts being bluish gray and his under parts  grayish white.  His favorite dwelling places are in the pine woods of  the south, where he is on the most cordial terms socially with the pine  warbler and the red-cockaded woodpecker.  A most active little body, he  scampers from the roots of the trees to the terminal twigs at the top,  inspecting every cone, cranny and knot hole, chirping his fine,  high-keyed notes, sometimes in a querulous tone, and again in the most  cheerful and good-natured temper imaginable, now gliding up a tree  trunk, now scudding down head foremost, anon circling in a spiral  course.    One autumn I found a number of these nuthatches associated with a flock  of myrtle warblers on the most sociable terms in a pine woodland not  far from Pensacola, Florida.  Now they were up in the trees, now down  on the ground.  All the while they were chirping in their most genial  tones.  In a spring jaunt to southern Mississippi, I was fortunate  enough to find a nest in a half-decayed snag.  It contained four of the  prettiest half-fledged bird babies that have ever greeted my sight.    Oddly enough, our tiny clamberers utter a loud, shrill alarm-call that  bears close resemblance to the querulous protest of the sparrow hawk as  you approach her nest or young.  Doctor Chapman says of the brown  heads: \"They are talkative sprites, and, like a group of school  children, each one chatters away without paying the slightest attention  to what his companions are saying.\"    The fourth member of the _Sittinae_ subfamily in America is the pigmy  nuthatch, known scientifically as _Sitta pygmaea_, a genuine westerner,  not known east of the plains.  However, in the Rocky Mountain district  he is an abundant species, his range east and west being from the  plains to the Pacific coast, and north and south from the Canadian  boundary to the mountains of Mexico.  Swinging and gliding about among  the pines, performing the same antics as his eastern kinsmen, he utters  a cheery whistle, that may be translated, \"Whit, whit, whit.\"  His  movements are often so rapid that he is difficult to follow with the  eye as he flits from one tree to another or dashes amid the branches.  He scarcely remains quiet long enough for you to note his markings and  settle his identity, but once you are sure of him, you will never"]]]
