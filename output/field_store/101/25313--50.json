Even in the two battles of Stillwater Gates  did next to nothing, not even appearing on the field. Arnold and Morgan  were the soul of the army on both days. Arnold's gallant conduct was at  once rewarded by a major-generalship. Schuyler, underrated and even  maligned in his day, had to wait for the approval of posterity, which he  has now fully obtained.    The surrender of Burgoyne was the most important event of the war up to  that time. It was of immense service at home, raising the country out of  the despondency which followed upon Brandywine and Germantown. Abroad it  disheartened England, and decided France to acknowledge the independence  of America and to send military aid. From the end of this year, 1777,  victory over England was a practical certainty.        CHAPTER VI.    THE SOUTHERN CAMPAIGNS    [1778]    After the summer of 1778 little of military importance occurred at the  North. July and November of that year were marked by bloody Indian  massacres at Wyoming, Pa., and Cherry Valley, N. Y., the worst in all  that border warfare which was incessant from the beginning to the end of  the Revolution. In August an unsuccessful attempt to regain Newport was  made by General Sullivan, co-operating with a French fleet under  D'Estaing. In the spring and summer of 1779, Clinton, who lay at New  York with a considerable army, closely watched by Washington, sent out  to Connecticut and the coasts of Virginia a number of plundering  expeditions which did much damage. \"Mad Anthony Wayne\" led a brilliant  attack against Stony Point on the Hudson, captured the British garrison,  and destroyed the fortifications. This year was also marked by a great  naval victory. Paul Jones lashed his vessel, the Bonhomme Richard, to  the British Serapis, off the northeast coast of England, and after a  desperate fight of three hours forced the Serapis to surrender.    But the brunt of the war now fell on the South, where the British,  unsuccessful in the Northern and Middle States, hoped for an easy  conquest. The capture of Savannah in December, 1778, and of Augusta the  next month, laid Georgia prostrate. The royal government was re-instated  by Prevost, the British general. Our General Lincoln, who had been  placed in command of the Southern army, assisted by D'Estaing with his  fleet, besieged Savannah, but on October 9, 1779, was repulsed with  heavy loss.    [1780]    In the spring of 1780 Clinton arrived from New York with a fleet and  troops. Charleston, S. C, was besieged by land and sea. Lincoln was  compelled to surrender with his whole army. Beaufort, Ninety-Six, and  Camden capitulated in rapid succession. Marauding expeditions overran  the State. President Andrew Jackson carried to his grave scars of hurts,  one on his head, another on his hand, given him by Tarleton's men when  he was a boy at Waxhaw. The patriots lay helpless. The loyalists  organized as militia and joined the British. Clinton, elated by success,  hoped to force the entire population into allegiance to the king. The  estates of patriots were sequestered. Any Carolinian found in arms  against the king might be, and multitudes were, hung for treason.  Clinton even issued a proclamation requiring all inhabitants to take  active part on the royalist side. Sumter, Marion, and other leaders,  gathering around them little companies of bold men, carried on a  guerilla warfare which proved very annoying to the British. They would  sally forth from their hiding-places in the swamps, surprise some  British outpost or cut off  some detachment, and retreat with their  booty and prisoners before pursuit could be made.

Help must come from without. And help was coming. Washington detached  from his scanty army 2,000 Maryland troops and the Delaware  regiment--all veterans--and sent them south under De Kalb, a brave  officer of German blood, who had seen long service in France. Virginia,  though herself exposed, nobly contributed arms and men. Gates, the  laurels of Saratoga still fresh upon his brow, was, against Washington's  judgment, appointed by Congress to succeed Lincoln.    Cornwallis, whom the return of Clinton to New York had left in command,  lay at Camden, S. C. Gates, as if he had but to look the Briton in the  eye to beat him, pompously assumed the offensive. On August 15th he made  a night march to secure a more favorable position near Camden.  Cornwallis happened to have chosen  the same night for an attack upon  Gates. The two armies unexpectedly met in the woods, nine miles from  Camden, early in the morning of the 16th. Gates's force, increased by  North Carolina militia, was between 3,000 and 4,000. Cornwallis had  about 2,000. The American position was strong, a swamp protecting both  flanks, but at the first bayonet charge of the British veterans the raw  militia threw away their guns and \"ran like a torrent.\" The Maryland and  Delaware Continentals stood their ground bravely, but were finally  obliged to retreat. De Kalb fell, with eleven wounds.      [Illustration: Portrait, holding a spear.]  General Sullivan.      This heroic foreigner had been sent hither by Choiseul before the  Revolution to report to the French minister on American affairs, and at  the outbreak of war had at great cost cast in his lot with our fathers.  Sent south to aid Lincoln, he arrived only in time to be utilized by  Gates. De Kalb was the hero of Camden. Wounded and his horse shot from  under him, on foot he led his stanch division in a charge which drove  Rawdon's men and took fifty prisoners. Believing his side victorious he  would not yield, though literally ridden down by Cornwallis' dragoons,  till his wounds exhausted him. Two-fifths of his noble division fell  with him.    The whole army was pursued for miles  and completely scattered. Arms,  knapsacks, broken wagons, dead horses strewed the line of retreat. The  Americans lost 900 killed and as many more prisoners. The British loss  was less than 500. Gates, who had been literally borne off the field by  the panic-stricken militia, rode in all haste two hundred miles north to  Hillsborough, N. C, where he tried to organize a new army.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General Lincoln.      The gloom created at the North by this defeat was deepened by the  startling news that Benedict Arnold, the hero of Saratoga, had turned  traitor. Smarting under a reprimand from Washington for misconduct,  Arnold agreed with Clinton to surrender West Point. The plot was  discovered by the capture of Clinton's agent, Major Andre, who was hung  as a spy. Arnold escaped to the British lines.    There was now no organized American force in the Carolinas, and  Cornwallis began a triumphant march northward. The brave mountaineers of  North Carolina and Virginia rose in arms. October 7th, 1,000 riflemen  fell upon a detachment of 1,100 British, strongly posted on King's  Mountain, N. C, and after a sharp struggle killed and wounded about 400,  and took the rest prisoners. In this battle fell one of the Tory  ancestors of the since distinguished American De Peyster family.    The King's Mountain victory filled the patriots with new hope and zeal,  and kept the loyalists from rising to support the British. Cornwallis  marched south again.      [Illustration: Several men camped in a swamp.]  General Marion in Camp.      Gates was now removed and General Nathaniel Greene placed in charge of  the Southern department. Greene was one of the most splendid figures in  the Revolution. Son of a Rhode Island Quaker, bred a blacksmith,  ill-educated save-by private study, which in mathematics, history, and  law he had carried far, he was in 1770 elected to the legislature of his  colony. Zeal to fight England for colonial liberty lost him his place in  the Friends' Society. Heading Rhode Island's contingent to join  Washington before Boston at the first shock of Revolutionary arms, he  was soon made brigadier, the initial step in his rapid promotion.  Showing himself an accomplished fighter at Trenton, Princeton,  Germantown, Monmouth, and the battle of Rhode Island, and a first-rate  organizer as quartermaster-general of the army, he had long been  Washington's right-hand man; and his superior now sent him south with  high hopes and ringing words of recommendation to the army and people  there.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Marquis de Lafayette.      [1781]    Greene's plan of campaign was the reverse of Gates's. He meant to harass  and hinder the enemy at every step, avoiding pitched battles. January  17, 1781, a portion of his army, about 1,000 strong, under the famous  General Daniel Morgan, of Virginia, another hero of Saratoga, was  attacked at Cowpens, S. C., by an equal number of British under the  dashing Tarleton. The British, riddled by a terrible cross-fire from  Morgan's unerring riflemen, followed up by a bayonet charge, fled, and  were for twenty-four miles pursued by cavalry. The American loss was  trifling. Tarleton lost 300 in killed and wounded, and 500 prisoners,  besides 100 horses, 35 wagons, and 800 muskets.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Benedict Arnold.      Cornwallis began a second march northward. Greene's force was too weak  to risk a battle. His soldiers were poorly clad, and most of them were  without tents or shoes. He therefore skillfully retreated across North  Carolina, chased by Cornwallis.

Nevertheless, they are sufficiently distinct  and it is a general and convenient practice to give to each a separate  name, according to the means by which it is chiefly called into  existence. The combined forms of midriff and of rib-breathing constitute  the right way, and collar-bone breathing is totally wrong and vicious,  and should not in a state of health be made under any circumstances.  When enlarging our chests by the descent of the midriff, we inflate our  lungs where they are largest and where consequently we can get the  largest amount of air into them. When expanding our chests by raising  the shoulders and collar-bones, we inflate the lungs where they are  smallest and where, consequently, we get the smallest amount of air into  them. _The criterion of correct inspiration is an increase of size of  the abdomen and the lower part of the chest. Whoever draws in the  abdomen and raises the upper part of the chest breathes wrongly._\"    In normal breathing the body at inspiration increases in girth at the  waist, and the abdomen moves slightly outward as the viscera are forced  downward by the descent of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large  muscle which serves as a partition between the thorax or chest-cavity  and the abdomen. When relaxed its middle portion is extended upward into  the chest-cavity, presenting a concave surface to the abdomen. At  inspiration it contracts, descending so as to assume very nearly a plane  figure. At expiration the process is reversed, the diaphragm relaxes and  the abdominal viscera, released from its pressure and forced by the  abdominal muscles which contract as the diaphragm relaxes, moves upward  and inward.    This kind of breathing in which the muscular contraction of the  diaphragm calls in operation atmospheric pressure, supplies the body,  when tranquil, with nearly or quite enough air. When for any reason a  larger quantity of air is demanded, it may be secured by raising the  ribs, thereby increasing the chest-cavity.    In singing, the breath must be managed so that the air passing through  the larynx at expiration shall be set into vibration at the vocal bands.  Expiration, then, which ordinarily occurs very quickly must be retarded  by slowly relaxing the muscles which contract at inspiration. At the  same time the throat must be open, and the muscles surrounding the  resonance cavities relaxed to allow free movement of the sound-waves set  up at the vocal bands. Any upward movement of the shoulders and chest at  inspiration involving the contraction of many powerful muscles of back  and neck will occasion a stiffening of the throat, which prevents free  vibration of the vocal bands and seriously interferes with the resonance  of tone.    The conclusion of the whole matter is, that in singing we should take  breath exactly as in the ordinary quiet respiration, and avoid any  lifting of the shoulders. This is at least enough to say to a class of  children upon the subject.    The means adopted in education should be as simple and direct as  possible. It will be found unnecessary to say very much about breathing  in dealing with classes of children. In the first place, the moment the  subject is broached and the direction \"take a good breath\" or a similar  one given, each child will draw up the chest and shoulders prepared for  a mighty effort; while, if nothing is said about it, position alone  being attended to, the breathing will be all right. And again, while  adult singers for various reasons, one of which may be the supposition  that the more energy put forth the better the tone, often present  themselves to the voice-teacher with a fine assortment of bad  breathing-habits, children, on the contrary, are sent to school at so  young an age that a little watchfulness on the part of the teacher only  is necessary to avoid improper ways of taking breath and establish good  habits. If young children, then, are not permitted to raise the  shoulders, they will perforce breathe properly.    It seems inadvisable also to give any instruction regarding the emission  of air from the lungs in singing. None but cultivated singers, after  long practice and through a complete command of the muscles concerned,  can vocalize _all_ the air at the vocal bands. The absolute purity of  tone which is thus secured is a result that may or may not be reached in  any particular case. It depends upon the mental and physical  organization of the pupil as well as upon the method of the teacher.    Exercises which are adapted to the formation of good breathing-habits  are much more to the point in practical teaching than efforts at  explanation. Therefore, a few hints are given, which, it is hoped, may  be of practical value, for it is very important that good  breathing-habits be formed in school singing.    The change in structure which the larynx undergoes at puberty,  demolishing as it does the boy-voice, and rendering of no avail the  training of childhood in so far as it affects the larynx, does not  extend in its effects to the breathing-apparatus. So, a habit of  breath-management, good or bad, formed in school may continue through  adult life. Special breathing-exercises are sometimes recommended, but  their efficacy may be doubted, even if the length of time devoted to the  music lesson permits them. The inclination of pupils in such exercises  is to raise the chest and fill the lungs too full of air. The result is  too much air pressure at the vocal bands, and a stiffening of throat and  jaw muscles. The tone then will be loud; in fact, strong pressure of air  at the vocal bands is almost sure to force them into the fullest  vibration; that is, into the thick register, and, as a result of  contracted throat, the tone will be pinched, or throaty. It is  recognized, however, that it is just as easy to teach good habits of  breathing as bad.    This exercise may occasionally be given: The pupils first standing,  shoulders well set, but with no pushing out of chest, place hands at the  waist so that the movements of normal breathing may be felt. Now let the  pupils take a little breath _quickly_. The movement at the waist must be  outward and downward, never inward, at inspiration. The breath may be  held a few seconds by keeping the waist expanded-- keeping an imaginary  belt filled, for instance-- and then let go by relaxing at the waist.  If, however, there is any stiffening of the throat, as if it were  thought to cork up the air in the lungs, the object of the exercise, in  so far as it relates to the formation of good breathing-habits suitable  for easy vocalization, is defeated. Every teacher must use his judgment  in this matter of breath-management in singing. If pupils are, unguided,  using correct, easy methods, there is then no need to interfere. If some  are inclined to take too much breath and lift the shoulders, a few hints  may put them on the right track. _Loud singing and had breathing-habits  go together._ If the first is desired, the lungs must work at full  capacity, and hard blowing from the lungs forces the voice. On the  contrary, soft singing promotes quiet habits of breathing; and, if the  pressure of air at the larynx is moderate, soft tone is possible. If  thin, soft singing alone be allowed, quiet deep breathing will be  practiced instinctively.    The easy control of the muscles whose relaxation permits the exhalation  of air from the lungs is, as already said, gained by their proper  exercise in speaking and singing, for the same mechanism is called into  operation in speech as in song. In childhood the lungs can neither hold  as much, nor retain it so long and easily as in adult life.    There is no better way, perhaps, to acquire the ability to regulate the  air-pressure at the vocal bands than by soft, sustained singing. The  \"continuous tone\" described in a preceding chapter, secured in scale  drill by letting each child breathe at will, is an excellent exercise  for developing good breathing-habits. As there is no nervous tension  whatever, each pupil will naturally sustain tone until the need of  another breath is felt, when it will be taken quickly and the tone at  once resumed.    To sum up: Sit or stand in good position, the chest neither pushed out  nor in a state of collapse. Avoid any, even the slightest, upward  movement of the shoulders. Point out the movements at waist occurring at  inspiration and at expiration if necessary, not otherwise. Let the  breath be taken quickly, not too much at a time, and as often as need  be, and sing softly.      _Attack._    The beginning of each tone is called attack. The common faults of attack  in class-singing are sliding to the pitch instead of striking it  accurately, and beginning to sing with the mouth still closed, or only  partly open. When the attack presents the combined effects of these two  common habits, a quite realistic caterwaul is the result.    Both faults may be generally overcome or prevented by calling attention  to them. Good mental attention is the most infallible cure for slovenly  habits of attack. It may be that there are in all schools a certain  proportion of the pupils who have very weak and imperfect vocal organs;  in their cases, even good attention cannot overcome physical inability.    In repose the vocal bands are separated to allow the free passage of air  to and from the lungs. At phonation the bands are drawn toward each  other, meeting just as it commences. There need be no preliminary escape  of air. Also the resonance cavities above should be open, that the  vibrations generated at the vocal bands may find expansion and  resonance. The mouth and throat should then be opened a moment before  tone is attacked, when, if the pitch to be sung is clearly pictured in  the mind, both the \"slide\" and \"hum\" will be avoided.      _Tone-Formation._    Beauty of tone implies absence of disagreeable qualities, and"]]]
