[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22157"],[0,"Lectures on Stellar Statistics (#9)"],[1,"1897 by KAPTEYN and INNES on the plates taken for  the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung, and BARNARD's star in Ophiuchus,  discovered 1916. The last-mentioned star, which possesses the greatest  proper motion now known, is very faint, being only of the 10th  magnitude, and lies at a distance of 0.40 sir. from our sun and is  hence, as will be found from table 5 the third nearest star for which we  know the distance. Its linear velocity is also very great, as we find  from column 10, and amounts to 19 sir./st. (= 90 km./sec.) in the  direction towards the sun. The absolute magnitude of this star is 11m.7  and it is, with the exception of one other, the very faintest star now  known. Its spectral type is Mb, a fact worth fixing in our memory, as  different reasons favour the belief that it is precisely the M-type that  contains the very faintest stars. Its apparent velocity (_i.e._, the  proper motion) is so great that the star in 1000 years moves 3 deg., or as  much as 6 times the diameter of the moon. For this star, as well as for  its nearest neighbours in the table, observations differing only by a  year are sufficient for an approximate determination of the value of the  proper motion, for which in other cases many tens of years are  required.    Regarding the distribution of these stars in the sky we find that,  unlike the brightest stars, they are not concentrated along the Milky  Way. On the contrary we find only 6 in the galactic equator squares and  12 in the other squares. We shall not build up any conclusion on this  irregularity in the distribution, but supported by the general thesis of  the preceding paragraph we conclude only that these stars must be  relatively near us. This follows, indeed, directly from column 8, as not  less than eleven of these stars lie within one siriometer from our sun.  Their mean distance is 0.87 sir.

For  some of the stars (4) the radial velocity is for the present unknown,  but the others have, with few exceptions, a rather great velocity  amounting in the mean to 18 sir./st. (= 85 km./sec.), if no regard is  taken to the sign, a value nearly five times as great as the absolute  velocity of the sun. As this is only the component along the line of  sight, the absolute velocity is still greater, approximately equal to  the component velocity multiplied by [square root]2. We conclude that  the great proper motions depend partly on the proximity, partly on the  great linear velocities of the stars. That both these attributes here  really cooperate may be seen from the absolute magnitudes (_M_).    The apparent and the absolute magnitudes are for these stars nearly  equal, the means for both been approximately 7m. This is a consequence  of the fact that the mean distance of these stars is equal to one  siriometer, at which distance _m_ and _M_, indeed, do coincide. We find  that these stars have a small luminosity and may be considered as  _dwarf_ stars. According to the general law of statistical mechanics  already mentioned small bodies upon an average have a great absolute  velocity, as we have, indeed, already found from the observed radial  velocities of these stars.    As to the spectral type, the stars with great proper motions are all  yellow or red stars. The mean spectral index is +2.8, corresponding to  the type G8. If the stars of different types are put together we get the  table        _Type_    _Number_       _Mean value of M_        G         8                 5.3        K         4                 7.5        M         4                 9.6    We conclude that, at least for these stars, the mean value of the  absolute magnitude increases with the spectral index. This conclusion,  however, is not generally valid.      32. _Stars with the greatest radial velocities._ There are some kinds of  nebulae for which very large values of the radial velocities have been  found. With these we shall not for the present deal, but shall confine  ourselves to the stars. The greatest radial velocity hitherto found is  possessed by the star (040822) of the eighth magnitude in the  constellation Perseus, which retires from us with a velocity of 72  sir./st. or 341 km./sec. The nearest velocity is that of the star  (010361) which approaches us with approximately the same velocity. The  following table contains all stars with a radial velocity greater than  20 sir./st. (= 94.8 km./sec.). It is based on the catalogue of VOUTE  mentioned above.    Regarding their distribution in the sky we find 11 in the galactic  equator squares and 7 outside. A large radial velocity seems therefore  to be a galactic phenomenon and to be correlated to a great distance  from us. Of the 18 stars in consideration there is only one at a  distance smaller than one siriometer and 2 at a distance smaller than 4  siriometers. Among the nearer ones we find the star (050744), identical  with C. P. D. 5h.243, which was the \"second\" star with great proper  motion. These stars have simultaneously the greatest proper motion and  very great linear velocity.

Sure an' there's no thafe in this house.\"    \"He just ran in here from the street.\"    \"Bedad, is that true now? Where did he go to?\"    \"I don't know. How do you get to the roof?\"    \"Be the laddher at the back av the hall.\"    The old woman pointed in the direction, and Tom sped on. Soon he reached  a common wooden ladder leading to a scuttle, which was wide open. As the  youth mounted the ladder the scuttle was banged shut, almost hitting him  on the top of the head. Then he heard hasty footsteps across the roof.    \"Maybe he thinks he can jump to one of the other buildings,\" said Tom to  himself. \"Well, if he can do it, so can I.\"    He pushed the scuttle up with difficulty, for it was heavy. Then with  caution, for he did not want to receive a kick in the head, he gazed  around the roof of the tenement. Nobody was in sight.    With caution Tom stepped out on the roof. A number of chimneys were not  far off, and he wondered if Merrick was concealed behind them.    \"I wish I had a club or something,\" he thought. \"I'd have a tough time  of it up here, if it came to a hand-to-hand struggle.\"    With eyes on the alert, Tom made his way to one chimney and then  another. The swindler was not there, nor was he on the adjoining roof.  Then the youth got down on his hands and knees and looked over the edge  of the tenement, on the alleyway side. Here was an iron fire escape,  running from the fourth story to the second. On the fire escape he saw  Merrick, descending to the bottom with all possible rapidity.          CHAPTER X    JOLLY OLD SCHOOLMATES      Evidently the swindler had dropped from the roof to the upper landing of  the fire escape. He was now almost to the bottom.    \"Stop!\" cried Tom, but he knew the command was a useless one. At the  sound of his voice Merrick looked up and muttered something the boy  could not catch. Then he swung himself from the bottom landing of the  fire escape and dropped to the ground.    \"If he can get down that way, so can I,\" thought Tom, and in another  moment he was descending the escape in the same fashion as the swindler  had done. As he reached the second landing of the escape he saw Merrick  turn the corner of the alleyway and disappear on the street beyond.    When Tom came out on the street he almost ran into the arms of two burly  men who had come out of the tenement. Both caught him by the arms.    \"What does this mean, young fellow?\" asked one, savagely. \"Doing the  sneak-thief act?\"    \"I am after a thief,\" was the answer. \"Did you see a man running away?\"    \"No, and we don't think there was a man,\" answered one of the tenement  dwellers.    \"Well, there was a man,\" said Tom. \"Come, if you will help me catch him  I will reward you well.\"    \"What did he steal?\"    \"Some bonds worth ten thousand dollars--they belonged to my uncle,\"  explained Tom, hastily.    The promise of a reward made the men attentive and they soon agreed to  assist Tom as much as possible. Then Dick and Sam came in sight, and had  to be told of what had happened.    The two men knew the tenement and factory district well, and they led in  a hunt lasting over half an hour, and a policeman was likewise called  into service.    \"I've heard of that bond case,\" said the policeman. \"I'd like to lay my  hands on Merrick.\"    But the hunt was a useless one, for Merrick could not be found. For  their trouble Tom gave the two men from the tenement a dollar each, with  which they had to be satisfied. The policeman promised to report the  matter at headquarters, and as there seemed to be nothing else to do,  the three Rover boys walked down to the steamboat dock, first, however,  sending a telegram to Randolph Rover, relating briefly what had  occurred.    \"It's a great pity we didn't catch this Merrick,\" sighed Tom, when they  were steaming along the lake shore. \"Perhaps we'll never see or hear of  him again.\"    \"Well, we don't want Merrick as much as we want Uncle Randolph's  traction company bonds,\" answered Dick. \"If he has disposed of the bonds  it won't do much good to catch him,--unless, of course, he can get the  bonds back.\"    \"And he may not have had the bonds,\" put in Sam. \"That fellow Pike may  have handled them.\"    \"That is true, too,--although I somehow think Merrick is the prime mover  in this swindle.\"    \"I think that, too,\" said Tom.    The _Golden Star_ was a trim little side-wheeler with a fair-sized deck  fore and aft. The boys sat on the forward deck, and as the boat ran  along the shore of the lake they pointed out many localities known to  them.    \"There is where we went on the paper chase,\" said Sam.    \"Yes, and that is where we went on one of the encampments,\" added Tom.    \"We came fishing down here once,\" put in Dick. \"One of the boys went  overboard.\"    \"It was John Fenwick, the fellow we used to call Mumps,\" said Tom. \"By  the way, I wonder what has become of him?\"    \"Went west, I think,\" answered Sam. \"One of the boys said he was in the  insurance business with some relative.\"    \"He was a great toady to Dan Baxter.\"    \"So he was, but he had some good points, too.\"    So the talk ran on, until Cedarville was reached. On account of the  delay it was dark, and the boys wondered if they would find any  conveyance to take them to the Hall.    \"Hullo, here is Peleg Snuggers with the carryall!\" cried Sam, as the  general utility man of the school appeared. \"How are you, Peleg?\"    \"Fust rate,\" replied the man, grinning. \"Been waiting a long time for  you.\"    \"Sorry, but we couldn't make the captain hurry the boat,\" answered Dick.    \"Peleg, you're a sight for tired optics,\" said Tom, giving the man's  hand a squeeze that made him wince. \"How's your grandmother?\"    \"Why, Master Tom, I ain't----\"    \"And your great-granduncle? Is he over the shingles yet?\"    \"Why, Master Tom, I ain't got no----\"    \"And your second cousin by your first wife's sister? Did she get over  the heart failure she had when the canary took a fit?\"    \"Now, see here, Master Tom, don't you go for to joking an old man----\"    \"Joking, Peleg?\" returned Tom, solemnly. \"Why, you know I never joke.\"  And he took on an injured look.    \"Don't joke, eh? Well, if you ain't the greatest joker Putnam Hall ever  see then I'll eat my hat,\" declared Peleg. \"Jump in an' don't ask me  about no grandfathers, or wife's sisters, nor nuthing. Ain't you  hungry?\"    \"Hungry? I could eat a brickbat fried in lemon oil.\"    \"Then, unless you hurry, you won't get no supper.\"    \"Oh, Mrs. Green will get something for us, never fear,\" said Dick,  mentioning the matron of Putnam Hall, who was a warm-hearted and  generous woman, even though a little bit \"peppery\" at times.    \"All the other boys here now?\" asked Dick, as they drove off in the  direction of Putnam Hall.    \"I reckon the most of 'em are, Master Dick. So many coming an' going I  can hardly keep track of 'em.\"    \"Fred Garrison, Songbird Powell and Hans Mueller back?\" asked Sam.    \"Yes, an' they told me some wonderful stories of your doings down  south.\"    \"Are Larry Colby and George Granbury here?\" questioned Dick.    \"Yes.\"    \"I'll be glad to meet Larry and George again,\" went on Dick. \"I suppose  they'll have something to tell of what they did during vacation.\"    \"Every time I come to the Hall I think of the first time I came,\" said  Tom. \"Do you remember how I set off that giant firecracker?\"    \"Yes, and how old Josiah Crabtree put you under arrest for it,\" added  Sam. \"Wonder where old Crabtree is now?\"    \"He is out of prison,\" answered Peleg Snuggers. \"I got that from a man  in Cedarville. The man said as how Crabtree went to Canada.\"    \"Hope he stays there and never attempts to bother Mrs. Stanhope again,\"  was Dick's comment.    About half the distance to the Hall had been covered when there came a  shout on the road and Peleg Snuggers had to rein in his team. Then  several boys appeared, dressed in cadet uniforms, for Putnam Hall was a  military academy.    \"Whoop! here they are, fellows! Hurrah for the Rovers!\"    \"Rovers by name and rovers by nature!\"    \"Say, Tom, how do you like being adrift on the Gulf of Mexico?\"    \"Sam, don't you want to become a regular cowboy?\"    \"Dick, when I buy a houseboat I'm going to engage you as captain.\"    And then the students in the road clambered into the carryall and  tumbled all over the Rovers, hugging them and trying to shake hands at  the same time.    \"Larry, glad to see you, but please don't smother me.\"    \"I'll love you, George, if only you won't put your elbow through my  ribs.\"    \"I knew Fred would meet us.\"    \"You gif me der honor of dis,\" came from Hans Mueller. \"I tole dem  fellers to come along alretty.\"    \"Good for you, Hansy, old boy!\" cried Sam, and gave the German cadet a  tight squeeze.    \"Songbird, why don't you turn on the poetry pipe line and let her flow?\"  queried Larry Colby, who, even though an officer of one of the  companies, was as jolly as the rest of the students.    \"Yes, give us something by all means,\" said Tom. \"Something about  'stilly night,' 'fond recollections,' 'starved cats,' and the like.\"    \"Humph! 'stilly night' and 'starved cats'!\" snorted Songbird Powell.  \"You must think I'm running a hash mill instead of----\"    \"By no means, Songbird, dear!\" piped Tom. \"We all know you're the sole  owner of the largest poem factory in New York state. Let her flow by all  means.\"    \"If you don't recite, we'll sing,\" said Dick.    \"No, don't do that--yet,\" pleaded Songbird. \"I've got a verse or two all  ready,\" and he began, in slow, measured tones:        \"Back to dear old Putnam Hall!          Back to the days of yore!      Back to the good old times we had!          May we have many more!      Back to our lessons and our books,          And to the teachers, too,      Back to the drills and hours off----\"        \"And to the mutton stew!\"    finished Tom. \"Don't forget to put in Mrs. Green's wonderful mutton  stews.\"    \"No mutton stews in this!\" snorted"]]]
