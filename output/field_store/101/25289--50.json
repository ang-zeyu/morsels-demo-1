Although an excessively affectionate parent, Dr  Burton had no pleasure in the company of children, owing to his want of  any system with them. He could not, according to the common phrase,  \"manage\" children at all--a necessary art for any one who has much of  their company. He secured the services of a former governess of his  wife, a Miss Wade, as care-taker of his children; and, as soon as he  could, removed from the house in Royal Crescent to a small one in Castle  Street, and afterwards, from a wish to let his children amuse themselves  with little gardens of their own, to one in Ann Street. He has told the  writer's father, Cosmo Innes, then his most intimate friend, that the  first relief to his oppressed spirits was obtained from the nearest  realisation of the \"wild man\" life to be found within his own country.  He took long walks in all weathers, sometimes walking all night as well  as all day, at times with a companion, oftener with none. The late  Alexander Russel, then editor of the 'Scotsman,' was his companion in  some of these rambles, Joseph Robertson in others, and Cosmo Innes in  others. It was Mr Russel who accompanied him in the run across Ireland,  which took place about this time, and of which his printed sketch is one  of the liveliest of his minor writings. His pace was so rapid, and his  powers of walking so inexhaustible, that with the lapse of years it  became more and more difficult to find a companion who could keep up  with him. He has described to Mr Innes one particular walk taken alone  to the waterfall called the Grey Mare's Tail. The whole excursion was  performed in pitiless rain and wind, which gave the waterfall every  advantage, and it was while battling with the elements in climbing the  hill to view it that Dr Burton felt the first return of his natural  elasticity of spirit. He soon found also the best medicine of all in  hard work. The years between the death of his first wife and his second  marriage were the most active of his literary life, at least in the line  of periodical literature. He contributed regularly to 'Blackwood's  Magazine,' besides other periodicals. In 1852 he published narratives  from Criminal Trials in Scotland. In 1853 a 'Treatise on the Law of  Bankruptcy in Scotland,' and in the same year his 'History of Scotland  from the Revolution to the extinction of the last Jacobite Rebellion.'          CHAPTER IV.    SECOND STAGE OF LITERARY LIFE.    _Appointed Secretary to the Prison Board--Second marriage--Daily  life--Death of infant child--First volunteers--Removal to Craighouse._      In 1854 Dr Burton was appointed Secretary to the Prison Board, at a  salary of L700 per annum, and was thus relieved of the necessity, which  had pressed on him for more than twenty years, of maintaining himself by  his pen. On his appointment to this office he removed from Ann Street to  the house then 27 Lauriston Place, the site of which is now occupied by  the Simpson Memorial Hospital. In 1854 the situation was half rural. The  house stood in a good old-fashioned garden of its own, beyond which lay  a field containing some old trees; and the house possessed good offices,  stables, &c., which were soon adapted to a workshop for Dr Burton  himself, and rabbit and pigeon houses for his children.    The productiveness of the garden was marred by incursions of  rabbits,--_not_ the children's pets, but wild rabbits, however  incredible that may appear, now that the situation has got so entirely  separated from the country by new buildings. At that time there was no  building between Lauriston Place and Morningside.    Dr Burton, while a widower, had become a more and more frequent visitor  at the house of Cosmo Innes in Inverleith Row. The writer does not  recollect ever seeing him there along with other company--he preferred  finding the family alone. She has met him occasionally in company in  other houses--memorably in that of the late Mrs Cunningham, Lord  Cunningham's widow--but never, so far as she can remember, in that of  her father. He was at that time considered a good talker--his company  was sought for the sake of his conversation. His defect in conversation  was that he was a bad listener. His own part was well sustained.  His enormous store of varied information poured forth naturally and  easily, and was interspersed with a wonderful stock of lively anecdotes  and jokes. But he always lacked that greatest power of the  conversationalist, that subtle ready sympathy which draws forth the best  powers of others.    He was invaluable at a dull dinner-table, furnishing the whole _frais  de la conversation_ himself; but he never probably appeared to quite  such advantage as in the family party at 15 Inverleith Row. His long  walks with Mr Innes, sometimes on a Saturday, often on a Sunday,  generally ended by his accepting the proffered invitation to dinner on  his return. As he was the only guest, nothing could be more suitable or  delightful than his amusing the whole circle during the whole time of  his stay; and he has himself stated that his attention was first drawn  to a shy and particularly silent girl by her irresistible outbursts of  laughter at his stories, which outbursts in their turn encouraged him to  pour forth story after story of his vast repertory in that sort.    On the 3d of August 1855 John Hill Burton married Katharine Innes as his  second wife. He had by that time become accustomed to combine office  with literary work, and, with the extraordinary activity and  adaptability of his intellect, found them helpful to each other. About  the time of his second marriage he conceived the project of his complete  'History of Scotland,' and directed his studies and investigations  towards its execution, continuing, as his manner was, to throw off  slight foretastes of his greater work as articles for 'Blackwood,' &c.  His mode of life at that time was to repair to the office of the Prison  Board, in George Street, about eleven. He remained there till four, and  made it matter of conscience neither to do any ex-official writing, nor  to receive ex-official visits during these hours. He gave his undivided  attention to the duties of his office, but has often said that these  made him a better historian than he could have been without them. He  conceived it highly useful for every literary man, but especially for a  historian, to get acquainted with official forms and business. He has  himself expressed this opinion fully in his printed works. Returning  from his office to dinner at five, he would, after dinner, and after a  little family chat in the drawing-room, retire to the library for twenty  minutes or half an hour's perusal of a novel as mental rest. His taste  in novels has been already described. Although he would read only those  called exciting, they did not apparently excite him, for he read them as  slowly as if he was learning them by heart. He would return to the  drawing-room to drink a large cup of extremely strong tea, then again  retire to the library to commence his day of literary work about eight  in the evening. He would read or write without cessation, and without  the least appearance of fatigue or excitement, till one or two in the  morning.    Always an excellent sleeper, he would go to bed and to sleep till nine  or ten of the same morning, seldom joining the family breakfast, but  breakfasting by himself immediately before going to his office.    In Lauriston Place three more children were born to Dr Burton, a son and  two daughters. When the elder of the two little girls was hardly a year  old the whole nursery sickened, first of measles, then of hooping-cough.  Little Rose, the baby, being recommended change of air, the family went  to South Queensferry, and there the baby died, and was buried in Dalmeny  churchyard. Some earlier associations had attached both Dr Burton and  his wife to the neighbourhood; and during his latter years Dr Burton  frequently alluded to this little baby, the only child he lost, being  laid there,--and expressed a wish that when their time came, his wife  and he should lie there also. His wish was carried out in his own case.    In July of the following year the first company of volunteers formed in  Scotland exercised in the field at 27 Lauriston Place. Dr Burton  sympathised strongly in the volunteer movement, and joined the  Advocates' corps. Though never seriously apprehensive of an invasion of  our coasts, he considered it proper that we should increase our military  strength while foreign nations were so enormously augmenting theirs. He  drilled regularly with the volunteers while they continued to assemble  in his field, and until an accident had temporarily lamed him. He  marched past the Queen on the brilliant sunny day of the first great  Volunteer Review in the Queen's Park in 1860, his wife looking on in the  company of his old friend Sir John Kincaid, then an Inspector of  Prisons.    27 Lauriston Place was considered sufficiently rural to obviate the  necessity of going to the country, and during the six years of its  occupancy the family seldom left it. Dr Burton gave his wife a little  pony-carriage, by means of which sea-bathing could be had, when desired,  from Lauriston Place.    During the year 1860, the new buildings in the neighbourhood spoiled the  situation of the house, so as to render it hardly habitable. The field  where the volunteers had drilled was built upon almost up to the windows  of the house. To escape these disagreeables, a cottage at Lochgoilhead  was taken for August and September, and much enjoyed by the whole  family. A complete removal was also determined on for the following  Whitsuntide.    An old house near the Braid Hills had been a childish haunt of his  wife's, and it had been a childish dream of hers to repair that house,  then a ruin, and live in it. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22153"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Rome (#9)"],[1,"tantine, Algeria),  which was used by the faithful as a church, we find registered,  chalices of gold and silver, lamps and candelabras, eighty-two female  tunics, sixteen male tunics, thirteen pairs of men's boots,  forty-seven pairs of women's shoes, and so on.[29] A remarkable  discovery, illustrating the subject, has been lately made in the  Catacombs of Priscilla; that of a _graffito_ containing this sentence:  \"February 5, 375, we, Florentinus, Fortunatus, and Felix, came here AD  CALICE[M] (for the cup).\" To understand the meaning of this sentence,  we must compare it with others engraved on pagan tombs. In one, No.  25,861 of the \"Corpus,\" the deceased says to the passer-by: \"Come on,  bring with you a flask of wine, a glass, and all that is needed for a  libation!\" In another, No. 19,007, the same invitation is worded: \"Oh,  friends (_convivae_), drink now to my memory, and wish that the earth  may be light on me.\" We are told by S. Augustine[30] that when his  mother, Monica, visited Milan in 384, the practice of eating and  drinking in honor of the martyrs had been stopped by S. Ambrose,  although it was still flourishing in other regions, where crowds of  pilgrims were still going from tomb to tomb with baskets of provisions  and flasks of wine, drinking heavily at each station. Paulinus of Nola  and Augustine himself strongly stigmatized the abuse. The faithful  were advised either to distribute their provisions to the poor, who  crowded the entrances to the crypts, or to leave them on the tombs,  that the local clergy might give them to the needy. There is no doubt  that the record _ad calicem venimus_, scratched by Florentinus,  Fortunatus, and Felix on the walls of the Cemetery of Priscilla,  refers to these deplorable libations.    [Illustration: Sample of a Drinking-cup.]    Many drinking-cups used on these occasions have been found in Rome, in  my time. They are generally works of the fourth century of our era,  cut in glass by unskillful hands, and they show the portrait-heads of  SS. Peter and Paul, in preference to other subjects of the kind. This  fact is due not only to the special veneration which the Romans  professed for the founders of their church, but also to the habit of  celebrating their anniversary, June 29, with public or domestic  _agapai_. S. Peter's day was to the Romans of the fourth century what  Christmas is to us, as regards joviality and sumptuous banquets. On  one of these occasions S. Jerome received from his friend Eustochio  fruit and sweets in the shape of doves. In acknowledging the kind  remembrance, S. Jerome recommends sobriety on that day more than on  any other: \"We must celebrate the birthday of Peter rather with  exaltation of spirit, than with abundance of food. It is absurd to  glorify with the satisfaction of our appetites the memory of men who  pleased God by mortifying theirs.\" The poorer classes of citizens were  fed under the porticoes of the Vatican basilica. The gatherings  degenerated into the display of such excesses of drunkenness that  Augustine could not resist writing to the Romans: \"First you  persecuted the martyrs with stones and other instruments of torture  and death; and now you persecute their memory with your intoxicating  cups.\"    The institution of public granaries (_horrea publica_) for the  maintenance of the lower classes was also accepted and favored by  Christian Rome. On page 250 of my \"Ancient Rome,\" I have spoken of the  warehouses for the storage of wheat, built by Sulpicius Galba on the  plains of Testaccio, near the Porta S. Paolo, named for him _horrea  galbana_, even after their purchase by the state. These public  granaries originated at the time of Caius Gracchus and his grain laws.  Their scheme was developed, in course of time, by Clodius, Pompey,  Seianus, and the emperors, to such an extent that, in 312 A. D., there  were registered in Rome alone two hundred and ninety granaries. They  may be divided into three classes: In the first, and by far the most  important, a plentiful supply of breadstuffs was kept at the expense  of the state, to meet emergencies of scarcity or famine, and the wants  of a population one third of which was fed gratuitously by the  sovereign. The second was intended especially for the storage of paper  (_horrea chartaria_), candles (_horrea candelaria_), spices (_horrea  piperataria_), and other such commodities. The third class consisted  of buildings in which the citizens might deposit their goods, money,  plate, securities, and other valuables for which they had no place of  safety in their own houses. There were also private _horrea_, built on  speculation, to be let as strong-rooms like our modern vaults,  storage-warehouses, and \"pantechnicons.\"    The building of the new quarter of the Testaccio, the region of  _horrea_ par excellence, has given us the chance of studying the  institution in its minutest details. I shall mention only one  discovery. We found, in 1885, the official advertisement for leasing a  _horrea_, under the empire of Hadrian. It is thus worded:--    \"To be let from to-day, and hereafter annually (beginning on December  13): These warehouses, belonging to the Emperor Hadrian, together with  their granaries, wine-cellars, strong-boxes, and repositories.    \"The care and protection of the official watchmen is included in the  lease.    \"Regulations: I. Any one who rents rooms, vaults, or strong-boxes in  this establishment is expected to pay the rent and vacate the place  before December 13.    \"II. Whoever disobeys regulation No. I., and omits to arrange with the  _horrearius_ (or keeper-in-chief) for the renewal of his lease, shall  be considered as liable for another year, the rent to be determined by  the average price paid by others for the same room, vault, or  strong-box. This regulation to be enforced in case the _horrearius_  has not had an opportunity to rent the said room, vault, or strong-box  to other people.    \"III. Sub-letting is not allowed. The administration will withdraw the  watch and the guarantee from rooms, vaults, or strong-boxes which  have been sub-let in violation of the existing rules.    \"IV. Merchandise or valuables stored in these warehouses are held by  the administration as security for payment of rental.    \"V. The tenant will not be reimbursed by the administration for  improvements, additions, and other such work which he has undertaken  on his own account.    \"VI. The tenant must give an assignment of his goods to the  keeper-in-chief, who shall not be held responsible for the  safe-keeping of merchandise or valuables which have not been duly  declared. The tenant must claim a receipt for the said assignment and  for the payment of his rental.\"[31]    The granaries of the Church were intended only for the storage of  corn. The landed estates which the Church owned in Africa and Sicily  were administered by deputies, whose special duty it was to ship the  produce of the harvest to Rome. During the first siege of Totila, in  546, Pope Vigilius, then on his way to Constantinople, despatched from  the coast of Sicily a fleet of grain-laden vessels, under the care of  Valentine, bishop of Silva Candida. The attempt to relieve the city of  the famine proved useless, and the vessels were seized by the  besiegers on their landing at Porto. In 589 an inundation of the  Tiber, described by Gregoire de Tours, carried away several thousand  bushels of grain, which had been stored in the _horrea ecclesiae_, and  the granaries themselves were totally destroyed.    The \"Liber Pontificalis,\" vol. i. p. 315, describes the calamities  which befell the city of Rome in the year 605; King Agilulf trying to  enter the city by violence; heavy frosts killing the vines; rats  destroying the harvest, etc. However, as soon as the barbarians were  induced to retire by an offer of twelve thousand _solidi_, Pope  Sabinianus, who was then the head of the Church, _iussit aperiri  horrea ecclesiae_ (threw open the granaries), and offered their  contents at auction, at a valuation of one _solidus_ for thirty  _modii_.    [Illustration: A Granary of Ostia.]    The grain was not intended to be sold, but to be distributed among the  needy; the act of Sabinianus was, therefore, strongly censured, as  being in strong contrast to the generosity of Gregory the Great. A  legend on this subject is related by Paulus Diaconus in chapter xxix.  of the Life of Gregory. He says that Gregory appeared thrice to  Sabinianus, in a vision, entreating him to be more generous; and  having failed to move him by friendly advice, he struck him dead. The  price of one _solidus_ for thirty _modii_ is almost exorbitant; grain  cost exactly one half this at the time of Theodoric.    The institution has outlived all the vicissitudes of the Middle Ages.  Gregory XIII., in 1566, Paul V., in 1609, Clement XI., in 1705,  re-opened the _horrea ecclesiae_ in the ruined halls of the Baths of  Diocletian; and Clement XIII. added a wing to them, for the storage of  oil. These buildings are still in existence around the Piazza di  Termini, although devoted to other purposes.    It would be impossible to follow in all its manifestations the  material and moral transformation of Rome from the third to the sixth  centuries, without going beyond the limits of a single chapter.    The customs and practices of the classical age were so deeply rooted  among the citizens that even now, after a lapse of sixteen centuries,  they are noticeable to a great extent. When we read, for instance, of  Popes elected by the people assembled at the Rostra,[32] such as  Stephen III., in 768, we must regard the circumstance as caused by a  remembrance of past ages. Under the pontificate of Innocent II.  (1130), of Eugenius III. (1145-1150), and of Lucius III. (1181-1185)  the senators, or municipal magistrates, used to sit and administer  justice in S. Martina and S. Adriano, that is, in the classic Roman  Curia."]]]
