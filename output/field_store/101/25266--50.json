So, altogether, he made up his mind to help Dick on  as well as he could, and take pains to instruct him in the business.    Dick, on his side, was pleased with Mr. Murdock, and determined to make  him a confidant in the matter of his sudden accession of fortune.    He took an opportunity, therefore, during the day, to say to him, \"Mr.  Murdock, I want to ask your advice about something.\"    \"Well, my lad, what is it?\" said his friend, kindly. \"If it's about  choosing a wife, I don't know whether my advice will be good for much.\"    \"It isn't that,\" said Dick. \"Next year'll be soon enough for that.\"    \"So I should think. Well, if it's nothing of that sort, what is it?\"    \"It's about investing some money. I thought you might be able to advise  me.\"    \"How much is it?\" asked Mr. Murdock, supposing the sum could not be more  than fifty or sixty dollars.    \"Eleven hundred dollars,\" said Dick.    \"How much?\" demanded the salesman, in surprise.    \"Eleven hundred dollars.\"    \"Is it your own?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Of course you couldn't have earned so much. Was it left to you?\"    \"I'll tell you all about it,\" said Dick. \"I wouldn't tell Mr. Gilbert,  and I don't mean he shall know it, but I'd just as lieves tell you. Do  you know why Mr. Rockwell gave me this place?\"    \"No; I've wondered a little, not at that, but at his giving you so much  higher pay than boys usually receive.\"    \"Then I'll tell you.\"    Dick proceeded to give an account of the manner in which he had rescued  little Johnny from drowning, as related in the adventures of \"Ragged  Dick.\"    \"It was a brave act,\" said Mr. Murdock.    \"It was nothing at all,\" said Dick, modestly. \"I could swim like a duck,  and I didn't mind the wetting.\"    \"But you ran the risk of drowning.\"    \"I didn't think of that.\"    \"If you had been a coward or a selfish boy, it would have been the first  thing you would have thought of. So Mr. Rockwell gave you this place in  acknowledgment of your service. I am glad he did. You deserve it.\"    \"He has done more,\" said Dick. Then he related the events of the evening  previous, and told Mr. Murdock of the two gifts he had received. \"So,  with the money I had before, I have now eleven hundred dollars,\" Dick  concluded. \"Shall I leave it in the savings bank, or can I do better  with it?\"    \"I'll tell you what I think will be a good investment,\" said Mr.  Murdock. \"I know a party who owns four adjoining lots on Forty-Fifth  Street. He is pressed for money, and wishes to dispose of them. He  offered them to me at twenty-two hundred dollars, half cash. I offered  him a thousand dollars cash for two of them, but he wishes to sell the  whole together. I think it will be an excellent speculation, for the  laying out of Central Park is carrying up the price of lots in the  neighborhood rapidly.\"    \"Why didn't you buy them, then?\"    \"Because I didn't want to buy anything that I couldn't pay for at once.  I've got a wife and three children to look out for, and so I can save  money but slowly. If I only had myself to take care of, I wouldn't  hesitate.\"    \"Can't we club together, and buy it?\" suggested Dick, eagerly.    \"That is just what I was going to propose. I think the owner will take  two thousand dollars down for the lots. That will be a thousand dollars  apiece. I've got that money, and so have you. What do you think of it?\"    \"Tip-top,\" said Dick, enthusiastically. \"It's just what I'd like to do.\"    \"Of course it wouldn't bring us in anything, but would, instead, be an  expense for the present, as we should have to pay taxes on it. On the  other hand, you could invest the money in bank-stock, so as to receive  seventy or eighty dollars annually at interest. You must decide which  investment you prefer. The land we may have to keep on hand four or five  years, paying taxes yearly.\"    \"But the price'll go up.\"    \"There is no doubt of that. The city is extending northwards rapidly. I  shouldn't be surprised if the lots would bring a thousand dollars apiece  in less than five years. This would be equal to a very handsome  interest.\"    \"I'm in for buying 'em,\" said Dick. \"So, if you'll see the owner, I'll  have the money all ready whenever you want it.\"    \"Very well, but perhaps you would like to see them first. We'll manage  to get off an hour earlier than usual this afternoon, and go up and take  a look at them.\"    \"It seems to me Mr. Murdock and that boy are pretty thick together,\"  said the book-keeper, glancing through the glass partition. He could see  that they were conversing earnestly, but of course couldn't hear a word  that was said. \"What he or Mr. Rockwell can see in the young rascal  passes my comprehension.\"    He called sharply to Dick, and ordered him to go to the post-office for  letters.    \"All right,\" said Dick.    \"And mind you don't loiter by the way,\" said the book-keeper, sharply.  \"You were gone long enough at the bank this morning. Did you come right  back?\"    \"No,\" said Dick.    \"Why didn't you?\"    \"There was somewhere else I wanted to go.\"    \"On your own business, or Mr. Rockwell's?\"    \"On my own business.\"    \"So I thought. I shall report you to Mr. Rockwell,\" said Gilbert,  triumphantly.    \"I wouldn't, if I were you,\" said Dick, coolly.    \"And why not, you young rascal?\"    \"Because he knows it already.\"    \"Knows it already,\" repeated the book-keeper, discomfited. \"Well, I hope  he gave you a good scolding.\"    \"I am sorry to disappoint you,\" said Dick; \"but he knows it, because he  gave me leave to go.\"    \"I don't believe it,\" said Gilbert, mortified to find that Dick was in  the right after all.    \"Then perhaps you'd better ask Mr. Rockwell.\"    \"I will,\" said Gilbert, who really had no intention of doing so. \"You  must have had some very urgent private business,\" he added, with a  sneer.    \"You're right, there,\" said Dick.    \"Playing marbles with some of your ragamuffin friends, I suppose.\"    \"Playin' marbles is a very refined and intellectual amusement,\" said  Dick; \"but I don't play marbles in business hours.\"    \"Where did you go?\" said the book-keeper, impatiently. \"I don't want any  of your impertinence.\"    \"I went to the savings bank,\" said Dick.    \"I suppose you have a very large account there,\" sneered Gilbert.    \"Yes,\" said Dick, quietly; \"pretty large.\"    \"It's to be hoped you won't withdraw your patronage, or the bank might  fail.\"    \"Then I won't,\" said Dick. \"Shall I go to the post-office now?\"    \"Yes, and be quick about it.\"    The book-keeper had some curiosity as to the amount of Dick's account at  the savings bank, but there was no good chance for him to inquire, and  he accordingly returned to his writing, more prejudiced against Dick  than ever.    On the whole, I have some doubts whether Dick's manner was quite as  respectful as it ought to have been to one who was older and higher in  office than himself. I should not recommend my young readers to imitate  him in this respect. But it is my business to describe Dick just as he  was, and I have already said that he was not a model boy. Still in most  respects he tried to do what was right, and it must be admitted that the  book-keeper's treatment of him was not likely to inspire much attachment  or respect. Dick had no difficulty in perceiving the dislike entertained  by Gilbert for him, and he was beginning to cherish a similar feeling  towards the book-keeper. He determined, however, to give him no cause of  complaint, so far as he was entitled to command his services; but it  must be confessed he found much more satisfaction in obeying Mr.  Rockwell and Mr. Murdock.          CHAPTER VIII.    NEW PLANS.      At the close of the afternoon, as had been proposed, Mr. Murdock,  accompanied by Dick, rode up as far as Forty-Fifth Street, to look at  the lots which he had suggested buying. They were located in a very  eligible situation, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Some of my young  readers may not be aware that the dimensions of a city lot are  twenty-five feet front by one hundred feet in depth. The four lots  together made a plot of one hundred feet by one hundred, or a little  less than quarter of an acre. In the country the whole would scarcely  have been considered sufficient for a house with a good yard in front;  but if people choose to live in the city they must make up their minds  to be crowded.    \"It looks small,--don't it?\" said Dick. \"I shouldn't think there was  four lots there.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Murdock, \"they are of the regular size. Some lots are  only twenty feet wide. These are twenty-five. They don't look so large  before they are built on.\"    \"Well,\" said Dick, \"I'm in for buying them.\"    \"I think it will be a good investment for both of us,\" said Mr. Murdock.    \"The money shall be ready whenever you want it,\" said Dick.    \"Very well. I will see the owner to-morrow, or rather this evening, as  it is best to be prompt, lest we might lose so favorable a bargain. I  will make the best terms I can with him, and let you know the result  to-morrow.\"    \"All right!\" said Dick. \"Good-night, Mr. Murdock.\"    \"Good-night. By-the-by, why won't you come round and take supper with  us? My wife and children will be glad to make your acquaintance.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Dick. \"I will come some other evening with pleasure;  but if I stay away without saying anything about it, Fosdick won't know  what's become of me.\"    Dick got back to Bleecker Street a little late for dinner. When he  entered the dining-room, the remainder of the boarders were seated at  the table.    \"Come, Mr. Hunter, you must render an account of yourself,\" said Miss  Peyton, playfully. \"Why are you late this evening?\"    \"Suppose I don't tell,\" said Dick.    \"Then you must pay a fine,--mustn't he, Mrs. Browning?\"    \"That depends upon who is to benefit by the fines,\" said the landlady.  \"If they are to be paid to me, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21653"],[0,"The Eurhythmics of Jaques-Dalcroze (#9)"],[1,"valuable help in these ideas I am indebted to      Mr. J. W. Harvey. I should like to quote verbatim one or      two remarks of his on the subject, taken from a recent      letter: \"Human motion gives the convergence of time      (inner sense) and space (outer sense), the spirit and      the body. Time, which we are in our inner selves, is      more dissociable from us than space, which only our      bodies have; the one (time) can be interpreted      emotionally and directly by a time-sense; the other      (space) symbolically, by a space-sense, which is      sight.\"    To speak of the rhythm of painting may seem fanciful, but I think that  is only lack of familiarity. The expression is used here with no  intention of metaphor. Great pictures have a very marked and real  rhythm, of colour, of line, of feeling. The best prose-writing has  equally a distinct rhythm.    There was never an age in the history of art when rhythm played a more  important part than it does to-day. The teaching of M. Dalcroze at  Hellerau is a brilliant expression of the modern desire for rhythm in  its most fundamental form--that of bodily movement. Its nature and  origin have been described elsewhere; it is for me to try and suggest  the possibilities of its influence on every other art, and on the whole  of life.    Let it be clearly understood from the first that the rhythmic training  at Hellerau has an importance far deeper and more extended than is  contained in its immediate artistic beauty, its excellence as a purely  musical training, or its value to physical development. This is not a  denial of its importance in these three respects. The beauty of the  classes is amazing; the actor, as well as the designer of stage-effects,  will come to thank M. Dalcroze for the greatest contribution to their  art that any age can show. He has recreated the human body as a  decorative unit. He has shown how men, women and children can group  themselves and can be grouped in designs as lovely as any painted  design, with the added charm of movement. He has taught individuals  their own power of gracious motion and attitude. Musically and  physically the results are equally wonderful. But the training is more  than a mere musical education; it is also emphatically more than  gymnastics.    Perhaps in the stress laid on individuality may be seen most easily the  possibilities of the system. Personal effort is looked for in every  pupil. Just as the learner of music must have the \"opportunity of  expressing his own musical impressions with the technical means which  are taught him,\"[1] so the pupil at Hellerau must come to improvise from  the rhythmic sense innate in him, rhythms of his own.[2]        [1] Cf. supra, p. 28.        [2] A good example of the fertility and variety of the      individual effort obtained at Hellerau was seen at the      Auffuehrung given on December 11, 1911. Two pupils      undertook to realize a Prelude of Chopin, their choice      falling by chance on the same Prelude. But hardly a      movement of the two interpretations was the same. The      first girl lay on the ground the whole time, her head      on her arm, expressing in gentle movements of head,      hands and feet, her idea of the music. At one point      near the end, with the rising passion of the music, she      raised herself on to her knees; then sank down again to      her full length.        The second performer stood upright until the very end.      At the most intense moment her arms were stretched      above her head; at the close of the music she was bowed      to the ground, in an attitude expressive of the utmost      grief. In such widely different ways did the same piece      of music speak to the individualities of these two      girls.    To take a joy in the beauty of the body, to train his mind to move  graciously and harmoniously both in itself and in relation to those  around him, finally, to make his whole life rhythmic--such an ideal is  not only possible but almost inevitable to the pupil at Hellerau. The  keenness which possesses the whole College, the delight of every one in  their work, their comradeship, their lack of self-consciousness, their  clean sense of the beauty of natural form, promises a new and more  harmonious race, almost a realization of Rousseau's ideal, and with it  an era of truly rhythmic artistic production.    That the soil is ready for the new seed may be shown by a moment's  consideration of what I consider to be a parallel development in  painting. There is in Munich a group of artists who call themselves Der  Blaue Reiter. They are led by a Russian, Wassily Kandinsky, and a  German, Franz Marc, and it is of Kandinsky's art that I propose to  speak. Kandinsky is that rare combination, an artist who can express  himself in both words and paint. His book--_Ueber das Geistige in der  Kunst_[1]--is an interesting and subtle piece of aesthetic philosophy.  His painting is a realization of the attempt to paint music. He has  isolated the emotion caused by line and colour from the external  association of idea. All form in the ordinary representative sense is  eliminated. But form there is in the deeper sense, the shapes and  rhythms of the _innerer Notwendigkeit_, and with it, haunting,  harmonious colour. To revert to a former metaphor, painting has been  brought into the centre of the scale. As Kandinsky says in his book:  \"Shades of colour, like shades of sound, are of a much subtler nature,  cause much subtler vibrations of the spirit than can ever be given by  words.\" It is to achieve this finer utterance, to establish a surer and  more expressive connexion between spirit and spirit, that Kandinsky is  striving. His pictures are visions, beautiful abstractions of colour and  line which he has lived himself, deep down in his inmost soul. He is  intensely individual, as are all true mystics; at the same time the  spirit of his work is universal.        [1] _Ueber das Geistige in der Kunst._ Piper Verlag,      Muenchen, 3 Marks. See also vol. i. of _der Blaue      Reiter_. Piper Verlag, 10 Marks.    In this, then, as in so much else, Kandinsky and Dalcroze are advancing  side by side. They are leading the way to the truest art, and ultimately  to the truest life of all, which is a synthesis of the collective arts  and emotions of all nations, which is, at the same time, based on  individuality, because it represents the inner being of each one of its  devotees.
