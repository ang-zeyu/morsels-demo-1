From Fort Salisbury, which is only two hundred miles  from the Zambesi, I returned through Manicaland and the Portuguese  territories to Beira on the Indian Ocean, sailed thence to Delagoa Bay  and Durban, traversed Natal, and visited the Transvaal, the Orange Free  State, Basutoland, and the eastern province Cape Colony. The country had  long possessed a great interest for me, and that interest was increased  by studying on the spot its physical character as well as the peculiar  economic and industrial conditions which have made it unlike the other  newly settled countries of the world. Seeing these things and talking  with the leading men in every part of the country, I began to comprehend  many things that had previously been obscure to me, and saw how the  political troubles of the land were connected with the life which nature  imposed on the people. Immediately after my return to Europe, fresh  political troubles broke out, and events occurred in the Transvaal which  fixed the eyes of the whole world upon South Africa. I had not travelled  with the view of writing a book; but the interest which the events just  mentioned have aroused, and which is likely to be sustained for a good  while to come, leads me to believe that the impressions of a traveller  who has visited other new countries may be useful to those who desire to  know what South Africa is really like, and why it makes a noise and  stir in the world disproportionate to its small population.    I have called the book \"Impressions\" lest it should be supposed that I  have attempted to present a complete and minute account of the country.  For this a long residence and a large volume would be required. It is  the salient features that I wish to describe. These, after all, are what  most readers desire to know: these are what the traveller of a few weeks  or months can give, and can give all the better because the details have  not become so familiar to him as to obscure the broad outlines.    Instead of narrating my journey, and weaving into the narrative  observations on the country and people, I have tried to arrange the  materials collected in a way better fitted to present to the reader in  their natural connection the facts he will desire to have. Those facts  would seem to be the following: (1) the physical character of the  country, and the aspects of its scenery; (2) the characteristics of the  native races that inhabit it; (3) the history of the natives and of the  European settlers, that is to say the chief events which have made the  people what they now are; (4) the present condition of the several  divisions of the country, and the aspects of life in it; (5) the  economic resources of the country, and the characteristic features of  its society and its politics.    These I have tried to set forth in the order above indicated. The first  seven chapters contain a very brief account of the physical structure  and climate, since these are the conditions which have chiefly  determined the economic progress of the country and the lines of  European migration, together with remarks on the wild animals, the  vegetation, and the scenery. Next follows a sketch of the three  aboriginal races, and an outline of the history of the whites since  their first arrival, four centuries ago. The earlier events are lightly  touched on, while those which have brought about the present political  situation are more fully related. In the third part of the book, asking  the reader to accompany me on the long journey from Cape Town to the  Zambesi Valley and back again, I have given in four chapters a  description of the far interior as one sees it passing from barbarism to  civilization--its scenery, the prospects of its material development,  the life which its new settlers lead. These regions, being the part of  the country most lately brought under European administration, seem to  deserve a fuller treatment than the older and better-known regions.  Three other chapters give a more summary account of Natal, of the  Transvaal gold-fields, of that model republic the Orange Free State, and  of Basutoland, a native state under British protection which possesses  many features of peculiar interest. In the fourth and last division of  the book several questions of a more general character are dealt with  which could not conveniently be brought into either the historical or  the descriptive parts. I have selected for discussion those topics which  are of most permanent importance and as to which the reader is most  likely to be curious. Among them are the condition of the natives, and  their relations to the white people; the aspects of social and political  life; the situation of affairs in the Transvaal in 1895, and the causes  which brought about the Reform rising and the expedition of Dr. Jameson;  and finally, the economic prospects of the country, and the political  future of its colonies and republics.    In these concluding chapters, as well as in the historical sketch, my  aim has been to set forth and explain facts rather than to pass  judgments upon the character and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2233"],[0,"A Damsel in Distress (#9)"],[1,"more or less cold. It was the nature of  his profession that had largely brought about this cooling of the  emotions. To a man who, like George, has worked year in and year  out at the composition of musical comedies, woman comes to lose  many of those attractive qualities which ensnare the ordinary male.  To George, of late years, it had begun to seem that the salient  feature of woman as a sex was her disposition to kick. For five  years he had been wandering in a world of women, many of them  beautiful, all of them superficially attractive, who had left no  other impress on his memory except the vigour and frequency with  which they had kicked. Some had kicked about their musical  numbers, some about their love-scenes; some had grumbled about  their exit lines, others about the lines of their second-act  frocks. They had kicked in a myriad differing ways--wrathfully,  sweetly, noisily, softly, smilingly, tearfully, pathetically and  patronizingly; but they had all kicked; with the result that woman  had now become to George not so much a flaming inspiration or a  tender goddess as something to be dodged--tactfully, if possible;  but, if not possible, by open flight. For years he had dreaded to  be left alone with a woman, and had developed a habit of gliding  swiftly away when he saw one bearing down on him.    The psychological effect of such a state of things is not difficult  to realize. Take a man of naturally quixotic temperament, a man of  chivalrous instincts and a feeling for romance, and cut him off for  five years from the exercise of those qualities, and you get an  accumulated store of foolishness only comparable to an escape of  gas in a sealed room or a cellarful of dynamite. A flicker of a  match, and there is an explosion.    This girl's tempestuous irruption into his life had supplied flame  for George. Her bright eyes, looking into his, had touched off the  spiritual trinitrotoluol which he had been storing up for so long.  Up in the air in a million pieces had gone the prudence and  self-restraint of a lifetime. And here he was, as desperately in  love as any troubadour of the Middle Ages.    It was not till he had finished shaving and was testing the  temperature of his bath with a shrinking toe that the realization  came over him in a wave that, though he might be in love, the  fairway of love was dotted with more bunkers than any golf course  he had ever played on in his life. In the first place, he did not  know the girl's name. In the second place, it seemed practically  impossible that he would ever see her again. Even in the midst of  his optimism George could not deny that these facts might  reasonably be considered in the nature of obstacles. He went back  into his bedroom, and sat on the bed. This thing wanted thinking  over.    He was not depressed--only a little thoughtful. His faith in his  luck sustained him. He was, he realized, in the position of a man  who has made a supreme drive from the tee, and finds his ball near  the green but in a cuppy lie. He had gained much; it now remained  for him to push his success to the happy conclusion. The driver of  Luck must be replaced by the spoon--or, possibly, the niblick--of  Ingenuity. To fail now, to allow this girl to pass out of his life  merely because he did not know who she was or where she was, would  stamp him a feeble adventurer. A fellow could not expect Luck to  do everything for him. He must supplement its assistance with his  own efforts.    What had he to go on? Well, nothing much, if it came to that,  except the knowledge that she lived some two hours by train out of  London, and that her journey started from Waterloo Station. What  would Sherlock Holmes have done? Concentrated thought supplied no  answer to the question; and it was at this point that the cheery  optimism with which he had begun the day left George and gave place  to a grey gloom. A dreadful phrase, haunting in its pathos, crept  into his mind. \"Ships that pass in the night!\" It might easily turn  out that way. Indeed, thinking over the affair in all its aspects  as he dried himself after his tub, George could not see how it  could possibly turn out any other way.    He dressed moodily, and left the room to go down to breakfast.  Breakfast would at least alleviate this sinking feeling which was  unmanning him. And he could think more briskly after a cup or two  of coffee.    He opened the door. On a mat outside lay a letter.    The handwriting was feminine. It was also in pencil, and strange to  him. He opened the envelope.    \"Dear Mr. Bevan\" (it began).    With a sudden leap of the heart he looked at the signature.    The letter was signed \"The Girl in the Cab.\"          \"DEAR MR. BEVAN,        \"I hope you won't think me very rude, running off      without waiting to say good-bye. I had to. I saw Percy      driving up in a cab, and knew that he must have followed us.      He did not see me, so I got away all right. I managed      splendidly about the money, for I remembered that I was      wearing a nice brooch, and stopped on the way to the      station to pawn it.        \"Thank you ever so much again for all your wonderful      kindness.           Yours,         THE GIRL IN THE CAB.\"      George read the note twice on the way down to the breakfast room,  and three times more during the meal; then, having committed its  contents to memory down to the last comma, he gave himself up to  glowing thoughts.    What a girl! He had never in his life before met a woman who could  write a letter without a postscript, and this was but the smallest  of her unusual gifts. The resource of her, to think of pawning that  brooch! The sweetness of her to bother to send him a note! More  than ever before was he convinced that he had met his ideal, and  more than ever before was he determined that a triviality like  being unaware of her name and address should not keep him from her.  It was not as if he had no clue to go upon. He knew that she lived  two hours from London and started home from Waterloo. It narrowed  the thing down absurdly. There were only about three counties in  which she could possibly live; and a man must be a poor fellow who  is incapable of searching through a few small counties for the girl  he loves. Especially a man with luck like his.    Luck is a goddess not to be coerced and forcibly wooed by those who  seek her favours. From such masterful spirits she turns away. But  it happens sometimes that, if we put our hand in hers with the  humble trust of a little child, she will have pity on us, and not  fail us in our hour of need. On George, hopefully watching for  something to turn up, she smiled almost immediately.    It was George's practice, when he lunched alone, to relieve the  tedium of the meal with the assistance of reading matter in the  shape of one or more of the evening papers. Today, sitting down to  a solitary repast at the Piccadilly grill-room, he had brought with  him an early edition of the Evening News. And one of the first  items which met his eye was the following, embodied in a column  on one of the inner pages devoted to humorous comments in prose and  verse on the happenings of the day. This particular happening the  writer had apparently considered worthy of being dignified by  rhyme. It was headed:        \"THE PEER AND THE POLICEMAN.\"          \"Outside the 'Carlton,' 'tis averred, these stirring      happenings occurred. The hour, 'tis said (and no one      doubts) was half-past two, or thereabouts. The day was      fair, the sky was blue, and everything was peaceful too,      when suddenly a well-dressed gent engaged in heated      argument and roundly to abuse began another well-dressed      gentleman. His suede-gloved fist he raised on high to dot      the other in the eye. Who knows what horrors might have      been, had there not come upon the scene old London city's      favourite son, Policeman C. 231.  'What means this conduct?      Prithee stop!' exclaimed that admirable slop. With which he      placed a warning hand upon the brawler's collarband. We      simply hate to tell the rest. No subject here for flippant      jest. The mere remembrance of the tale has made our ink      turn deadly pale. Let us be brief. Some demon sent stark      madness on the well-dressed gent. He gave the constable a      punch just where the latter kept his lunch. The constable      said 'Well! Well! Well!' and marched him to a dungeon cell.      At Vine Street Station out it came--Lord Belpher was the      culprit's name. But British Justice is severe alike on      pauper and on peer; with even hand she holds the scale; a      thumping fine, in lieu of gaol, induced Lord B. to feel      remorse and learn he mustn't punch the Force.\"    George's mutton chop congealed on the plate, untouched. The French  fried potatoes cooled off, unnoticed. This was no time for food.  Rightly indeed had he relied upon his luck. It had stood by him  nobly. With this clue, all was over except getting to the nearest  Free Library and consulting Burke's Peerage. He paid his bill and  left the restaurant.    Ten minutes later he was drinking in the pregnant information that  Belpher was the family name of the Earl of Marshmoreton, and that  the present earl had one son, Percy Wilbraham Marsh, educ. Eton and  Christ Church, Oxford, and what the book with its customary  curtness called \"one d.\"--Patricia Maud. The family seat, said  Burke, was Belpher Castle, Belpher, Hants.    Some hours later, seated in a first-class compartment of a train  that moved slowly out of Waterloo Station, George watched London  vanish behind him. In the pocket closest to his throbbing heart  was a single ticket to Belpher.        CHAPTER 6.    At about the time that George Bevan's train was leaving Waterloo, a  grey racing car drew up with a grinding of brakes and a sputter of  gravel in front of the main entrance of Belpher Castle.
