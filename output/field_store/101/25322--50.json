Gounaris, a statesman of  considerable ability, though with none of the versatility of mind and  audacity of character which distinguished his predecessor, to carry on  the Government and to preside over the elections.  Under ordinary  circumstances these would have taken place at once.  But owing to the  need of preparing electoral lists for the new provinces, they were  delayed till 13 June, and owing to a serious illness of King  Constantine which supervened--causing intense anxiety throughout the  nation and bringing political life to a standstill--two more months  passed before the new Parliament met.  The interval proved fruitful in  developments of far-reaching importance.    On its accession to power, the new Government issued a _communique_,  announcing that it would pursue the policy adopted at the beginning of  the War: a policy of neutrality qualified by a recognition of the  obligations imposed by the Servian Alliance, and a determination to  serve the interests of Greece without endangering her territorial  integrity.[1] And as the Entente representatives at Athens expressed a  certain disappointment at not finding in the _communique_ any allusion  to the Entente Powers,[2] M. Zographos, Minister for Foreign Affairs,  in order to remove all uneasiness on that score, instructed the Greek  representatives in London, Paris, and Petrograd to assure the  respective Governments categorically that the new Ministry did not  intend to depart in any way from the pro-Entente attitude dictated by  hereditary sentiments and interests alike.  The only {34} difference  between the Venizelos and the Gounaris Cabinets--the difference which  brought about the recent crisis and the change of Government--was one  regarding the danger of immediate action, but did not affect the basis  of Greek policy.[3]    That, by all the evidence available, was the truth.  M. Gounaris  thought as M. Venizelos thought, as King Constantine thought, as,  indeed, every Greek capable of forming an opinion on international  affairs thought--namely that, if Greece were to fight at all, interest  and sentiment alike impelled her to fight on the side of the  Entente.[4]  The only question was whether she should enter the field  then, and if so, on what conditions.    M. Venizelos persisted in declaring that the Dardanelles expedition  presented \"a great, a unique opportunity,\" which he prayed, \"God grant  that Greece may not miss.\" [5]  His successors had no wish to miss the  opportunity--if such it was.  But neither had they any wish to leap in  the dark.  M. Gounaris and his colleagues lacked the Cretan's infinite  capacity for taking chances.  Even in war, where chance plays so great  a part, little is gained except by calculation: the enterprise which is  not carefully meditated upon in all its details is rarely crowned with  success.    And so when, on 12 April, the representatives of the Entente signified  to M. Gounaris their readiness to give Greece, in return for her  co-operation against Turkey, the \"territorial acquisitions in the  vilayet of Aidin,\" suggested {35} to his predecessor, M. Gounaris tried  to ascertain exactly the form of the co-operation demanded and the  extent of the \"territorial acquisitions in the vilayet of Aidin\"  offered.  The British Minister replied as to the first point that,  having no instructions, he was unable to give any details; and as for  the second, that it referred to the \"very important concessions on the  Asia Minor coast\" mentioned in Sir Edward Grey's communication of  January.  On being further pressed, he said it meant \"Smyrna and a  substantial portion of the hinterland\"--a definition with which his  Russian and French colleagues were inclined to concur, though both said  that they had no instructions on the subject.  Then M. Gounaris asked  whether their Excellencies had transmitted to their respective  Governments M.  Venizelos's interpretation of Sir Edward Grey's offer  regarding its geographical limits.  The British Minister replied that  he had no official knowledge of that interpretation; he had only heard  of it semi-officially and had transmitted it to his Government, but had  received no answer.  The Russian Minister replied that he had  transmitted nothing on the subject to his Government, as he had been  informed of it in but a vague way by the late Cabinet.  The French  Minister stated that the subject had never been mentioned to him, and  consequently he had not been in a position to make any communication to  his Government.[6]  Thus the grandiose Asiatic dominion of which M.  Venizelos spoke so eloquently dwindled to \"Smyrna and a substantial  portion of the hinterland.\"    However, the King, the General Staff, and the Cabinet went on with  their work, and were joined by Prince George, King Constantine's  brother, who had come from Paris to Athens for the express purpose of  discussing with the Government the question of entering the war against  Turkey on the basis of guarantees to be determined by negotiations of  which Paris might be the centre.  In that order of ideas, they had  already indicated as the best guarantee the simultaneous entry of  Bulgaria, who, according to news from the Entente capitals, was on the  point of joining.  But this condition having proved {36}  unrealisable--Bulgaria refusing to be bought except, if at all, at a  price of Greek territory which Greece would on no account pay--they  dropped it and set about considering by what other combinations they  could come in without compromising their country's vital interests.  The upshot of their deliberations was a proposal, dated 14 April, to  the following effect:    If the Allies would give a formal undertaking to guarantee during the  War, and for a certain period after its termination, the integrity of  her territories, Greece would join them with all her military and naval  forces in a war against Turkey, the definite objective of which would  be the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire; for, unless the Ottoman  Empire disappeared, the Greek hold on Smyrna would not be very firm.  It was further stipulated that the Allies should define the territorial  compensations as well as the facilities regarding money and war  material which they would accord Greece in order to enable her to do  her part of belligerent efficiently.  On these conditions Greece would  assume the obligation to enter the field as soon as the Allies were  ready to combine their forces with hers.  All military details were to  be settled between the respective Staffs and embodied in a joint  Military Convention, with this sole reservation that, if Bulgaria  continued to stand out, the Greek Army's sphere of action could not be  placed outside European Turkey.  In an explanatory Note added a few  days later, at the instance of the General Staff, stress was laid upon  the ambiguous attitude of Bulgaria, on account of which the opinion was  expressed that the Allies should be prepared to contribute forces  which, combined with the Greek, would equal the united Turkish and  Bulgarian forces, and that the sphere of Greek action should be limited  to the west of the Gallipoli Peninsula; but it was agreed that, if the  Allies wished it, they should have the military assistance of Greece on  the Gallipoli Peninsula too, provided that they landed their own troops  first.[7]    Of these proposals, which were not put forward as final, but rather as  a basis of discussion, the Entente Powers did not condescend to take  any notice.  Only unofficially {37} the Greek Minister in Paris, on  approaching M. Delcasse, was told that, since the Hellenic Government  viewed the Dardanelles enterprise in a different light from them, an  understanding seemed impossible and discussion useless; for the rest,  that enterprise, for which England had desired the co-operation of the  Greeks, was now carried on without them, and the situation was no  longer the same as it was some days before.  Alarmed by this snub, and  anxious to dissipate any misunderstandings and doubts as to its  dispositions towards the Entente, the Hellenic Government assured M.  Delcasse that it continued always animated by the same desire to  co-operate and would like to make new proposals, but before doing so it  wished to know what proposals would be acceptable.  M. Delcasse replied  that he could not even semi-officially say what proposals would be  acceptable.[8]  But M.  Guillemin, his former collaborator and later  French Minister at Athens, then on a flying visit there, advised M.  Zographos to abandon all conditions and take pot luck with the Allies.    This notion succeeded to the extent that Greece proposed to offer to  enter the war against Turkey with her naval forces only, reserving her  army for her own protection against Bulgaria.[9]  The Entente Powers  intimated through M. Delcasse that they would accept such an offer,  provided it was made without any conditions.[10]  Before deciding,  Greece wanted to be assured that the integrity of her territory during  the War and in the treaty of peace would be respected, that all the  necessary money and material would be forthcoming, and that the  compensations in Asia Minor allotted to her would represent  approximately the area indicated by M. Venizelos.  If it was found that  on these three points the Hellenic Government interpreted the  intentions of the Entente Powers correctly, it would immediately submit  a Note in which the three points would be mentioned as going of their  own accord, so that the official reply of the Entente might cover, not  only the offer, but also its interpretation thus formulated.[11] {38}  M. Delcasse refused to listen to any points: Greece, he insisted  irritably, should enter the alliance without conditions, coupling her  offer simply with \"hopes to have the benefit of full solidarity with  her allies, whence results a guarantee of her territorial"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22690"],[0,"Rembrandt and His Works (#9)"],[1,"wiped, and touching out the high  lights with his finger, or a piece of leather. These impressions must  have been taken by himself, or, at least, under his superintendence.  Several of his plates are worked on with the graver, such as his \"Taking  down from the Cross;\" but that evidently is by the hand of an engraver.  We see the same in several of the etchings of Vandyke, but their value  decreases as the finishing extends.    While we are upon the subject of his etchings, it will, perhaps, be of  use to confine the conduct of his chiaro-scuro to his etchings alone, as  his treatment is very different to what he adopted when he had colour  to deal with; and in this respect he must have been influenced by the  example of Rubens and Vandyke, proofs of all the engravings after whose  pictures we perceive he had in his possession. In order that we may  more clearly understand the reason of many of his etchings remaining  unfinished in parts, while other portions are worked up with the  greatest care, I shall give an extract from the Journal of Sir Joshua  Reynolds, when in Flanders. In describing a picture in the Church of the  Recollets, at Antwerp, he says:--\"Over the altar of the choir is the  famous 'Crucifixion of Christ between two Thieves,' by Rubens. To give  animation to this subject, he has chosen the point of time when an  executioner is piercing the side of Christ, whilst another, with a bar  of iron, is breaking the limbs of one of the malefactors, who, in his  convulsive agony, which his body admirably expresses, has torn one of  his feet from the tree to which it was nailed. The expression in the  action of this figure is wonderful. The attitude of the other is more  composed, and he looks at the dying Christ with a countenance perfectly  expressive of his penitence. This figure is likewise admirable. The  Virgin, St. John, and Mary the wife of Cleophas, are standing by, with  great expression of grief and resignation; whilst the Magdalen, who is  at the feet of Christ, and may be supposed to have been kissing his  feet, looks at the horseman with the spear with a countenance of great  horror. As the expression carries with it no grimace or contortion of  the features, the beauty is not destroyed. This is by far the most  beautiful profile I ever saw of Rubens, or, I think, of any other  painter. The excellence of its colouring is beyond expression. To say  that she may be supposed to have been kissing Christ's feet, may be  thought too refined a criticism; but Rubens certainly intended to convey  that idea, as appears by the disposition of her hands, for they are  stretched out towards the executioner, and one of them is before and one  behind the cross, which gives an idea of their having been round it. And  it must be remembered that she is generally represented as kissing the  feet of Christ: it is her place and employment in those subjects. The  good Centurion ought not to be forgotten--who is leaning forward, one  hand on the other, resting on the mane of his horse, while he looks at  Christ with great earnestness. The genius of Rubens nowhere appears to  more advantage than here; it is the most carefully finished picture of  all his works. The whole is conducted with the most consummate art.  The composition is bold and uncommon, with circumstances which no other  painter had ever before thought of--such as the breaking of the limbs,  and the expression of the Magdalen; to which we may add the disposition  of the three crosses, which are placed perspectively, in a very  picturesque manner--the nearest bears the thief whose limbs they are  breaking; the next the Christ, whose figure is straighter than ordinary,  as a contrast to the others; and the furthermost the penitent thief.  This produces a most interesting effect, but it is what few but such a  daring genius as Rubens would have attempted. It is here, and in such  compositions, that we properly see Rubens, and not in little pictures of  Madonnas and Bambinos. It appears that Rubens made some changes in this  picture after Bolswert had engraved it. The horseman who is in the act  of piercing the side of Christ holds the spear, according to the print,  in a very tame manner, with the back of the hand over the spear,  grasping it with only three fingers, the forefinger lying straight over  the spear; whereas, in the picture, the back of the hand comes _under_  the spear, and he grasps it with his whole force. The other defect,  which is remedied in the picture, is the action of the executioner who  breaks the legs of the criminal: in the print, both of his hands are  over the bar of iron, which makes a false action; in the picture, the  whole disposition is altered to the natural manner in which every person  holds a weapon which requires both hands--the right is placed over, and  the left under it. This print was undoubtedly done under the inspection  of Rubens himself. It may be worth observing, that the keeping of the  masses of light in the print differs much from the picture; this change  is not from inattention, but design; a different conduct is required in  a composition with colours from what ought to be followed _when it is in  black and white only_. We have here the authority of this great master  of light and shadow, that a print requires more and larger masses of  light than a picture. In this picture, the principal and the strongest  light is the body of Christ, which is of a remarkably clear and bright  colour. This is strongly opposed by the very brown complexion of the  thieves, (perhaps the opposition here is too violent,) who make no great  effect as to light; the Virgin's outer drapery is dark blue, and the  inner a dark purple, and St. John is in dark strong red. No part of  these two figures is light in the picture but the head and hands of the  Virgin, but in the print, they make the principal mass of light of the  whole composition. The engraver has certainly produced a fine effect,  and I suspect it is as certain that if this change had not been made,  it would have appeared a black and heavy print. When Rubens thought it  necessary, in the print, to make a mass of light of the drapery of the  Virgin and St. John, it was likewise necessary that it should be of a  beautiful shape, and be kept compact; it therefore became necessary to  darken the whole figure of the Magdalen, which in the picture is at  least as light as the body of Christ; her head, linen, arms, hair,  and the feet of Christ, make a mass as light as the body of Christ.  It appears, therefore, that some parts are to be darkened, as well as  other parts made lighter. This, consequently, is a science which an  engraver ought well to understand before he can presume to venture on any  alteration from the picture he means to represent. The same thing may be  remarked in many other prints by those engravers who were employed by  Rubens and Vandyke; they always gave more light than they were warranted  by the picture--a circumstance which may merit the attention of  engravers.\"    As most of these engravings were made from studies in black and white,  perhaps reduced from the picture by the engraver, but certainly touched  on afterwards by the painters themselves, they form a school for the  study of light and shade when deprived of colour. In the etchings of  Rembrandt, therefore, we ought to bear in mind that splendour of effect  was what he aimed at, and the means adopted by Rubens and Vandyke were  carried still further by the fearless master of chiaro-scuro. Now  that the eye has been accustomed to engravings where the local colour  is rendered, when we look over a folio of the works of Bolswert,  Soutman, Pontius, and others of the Flemish engravers, they appear,  notwithstanding their overpowering depth and brilliancy, unfinished,  from the lights of the several coloured draperies and the flesh tones  being left white. They also occasionally look spotty in effect, from the  extreme strength of the shadows and black draperies. In Rembrandt's  works these defects are avoided, by finishing his darks with the  greatest care and softness, while the figures in the light masses are  often left in mere outline: the lights are also reduced in size as they  enter the shade; while the darks in the light portions of his prints are  circumscribed to a mere point, for the purpose of giving a balance and  solidity. The shadows of the several objects likewise assume a greater  delicacy as they enter into the masses of light. In these respects, the  Hundred Guilder print is a striking example.    As we are now considering light and shade when unaccompanied by colour,  I may notice that those portions where the dark and light masses come in  contact are the places where both the rounding of the objects by making  out the forms, and also the patching down the half-tint with visible  lines, may be followed out with the greatest success, as it prevents the  work being heavy in effect, and also assists the passage of the light  into the shadow. The quality of the lights and darks is flatness. The  Flemish engravers seem to have been very particular in the method of  producing their shadow, both with regard to the direction of the lines,  and also their repetition; their object seems to have been intenseness  of dark with transparency of execution. In a conversation with Sir  Thomas Lawrence upon the subject of shadows, his ideas were that they  ought to be as still as possible, and that all the little sparkling  produced by the crossing of the lines ought to be extinguished, or  softened down. In painting, his notions were that they ought to be kept  cool. Without presuming to differ with so excellent an artist, it is but  proper to mention that all the best engravers, from the time of Bolswert  to our own, are of a contrary opinion; and our best colourists, from  Coreggio to Rembrandt, and from Rembrandt to Wilkie, were diametrically  opposite in their"]]]
