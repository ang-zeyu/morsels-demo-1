Finally, on July 28, a  resolution \"that the Constitution be ratified _in full confidence_  that the amendments proposed by this convention will be adopted,\"  received a vote of thirty to twenty-seven. Governor Clinton did not  vote, but it was known that he advised several of his friends to  favour the resolution. On September 13, he officially proclaimed the  Federal Constitution as the fundamental law of the Republic.    Posterity has never severely criticised George Clinton's opposition to  national development. His sincerity and patriotism have been accepted.  To Washington and Hamilton, however, his conduct seemed like a cold  and selfish desertion of his country at the moment of its utmost  peril. \"The men who oppose a strong and energetic government,\" wrote  Washington to Hamilton on July 10, 1787, the day of Yates' and  Lansing's retirement from the Philadelphia convention, \"are, in my  opinion, narrow-minded politicians, or are under the influence of  local views.\" This reference to \"local views\" meant George Clinton,  upon whose advice Yates and Lansing acted, and who declared  unreservedly that only confusion could come to the country from a  convention and a measure wholly unnecessary, since the Confederation,  if given sufficient trial, would probably answer all the purposes of  the Union.    The march of events has so clearly proved the wisdom of Hamilton and  the unwisdom of Clinton, that the name of one, joined inseparably with  that of Washington, has grown with the century, until it is as much a  part of the history of the Union as the Constitution itself. The name  of George Clinton, on the contrary, is little known beyond the limits  of his native State. It remained for DeWitt Clinton, the Governor's  distinguished nephew, to link the family with an historic enterprise  which should bring it down through the ages with increasing respect  and admiration.          CHAPTER V    CLINTON'S FOURTH TERM    1789-1792      At each triennial election for twelve years, ever since the adoption  of the State Constitution in 1777, George Clinton had been chosen  governor. No one else, in fact, had ever been seriously talked of,  save John Jay in 1786. Doubtless Clinton derived some advantage from  the control of appointments, which multiplied in number and increased  in influence as term succeeded term, but his popularity drew its  inspiration from sources other than patronage. A strong, rugged  character, and a generous, sympathetic nature, sunk their roots deeply  into the hearts of a liberty-loving people who supported their  favourite with the fidelity of personal friendship.    The time had, however, come at last when Clinton's right to continue  as governor was to be contested. Hamilton's encounter with the New  York opponents of the Federal Constitution had been vigorous and  acrimonious. It was easy to stand with one's State in opposing the  Constitution when opposition had behind it the powerful Clinton  interest and the persuasive Clinton argument that federal union meant  the substitution of experiment for experience, and the exchange of a  superior for an inferior position; but it required a splendid  stubbornness to face, daringly and aggressively, the desperate odds  arrayed against the Constitution. Every man who wanted to curry favour  with Clinton was ready to strike at Hamilton, and they covered him  with obloquy. Very likely his attitude was not one to tempt the  forbearance of angry opponents. He did not fight with gloves.  Nevertheless, his success added one more to his list of splendid  victories. He had beaten Clinton in his intolerant treatment of  loyalists; he had beaten him in obtaining for Congress the sole power  of regulating commerce; he had beaten him in the Philadelphia  convention called to frame a federal constitution; he had beaten him  in a state convention called to ratify that constitution; and now he  proposed to beat him for governor in a State which would have great  influence in smoothing the way for the new federal government.    After the close of the Revolution, there had been local parties in the  various Stales, divided on issues of hard and soft money, on imposts,  on treatment of Tories, and on state rights, and these issues had  coincided in many of the States. During the contest growing out of the  adoption of the Federal Constitution, all these elements became  segregated into two great political parties, those who supported the  Constitution being known as Federalists--those who were opposed to  strengthening the bond between the States being called anti-Federalists.  The latter were clearly in the majority in New York, and Hamilton  rightly inferred that, notwithstanding the people, since the adoption  of the Constitution, manifested a disposition to sustain the general  government, a large majority of freeholders, having heretofore  supported Clinton as a wise, patriotic governor, would not now desert  him for an out-and-out Federalist. To meet this emergency, several  Federalists, at a meeting held February 11, 1789, nominated Robert  Yates, an anti-Federalist judge of the Supreme Court, hoping thus to  form a coalition with the more moderate men of his party.    In support of such politics, of the doubtful wisdom of which there was  abundant illustration in the recent unnatural coalition between Lord  North and the brilliant Charles James Fox, Hamilton wrote to his  friends in Albany that in settling upon a candidate, some difficulties  occurred. \"Our fellow citizens in some parts of the State,\" he said,  \"had proposed Judge Yates, others had been advocates of  Lieutenant-Governor Van Cortlandt, and others for Chief Justice  Morris. It is well known that the inhabitants of this city are, with  few exceptions, strongly attached to the new Constitution. It is also  well known that the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Justice, whom we  respect and esteem, were zealous advocates for the same cause. Had it  been agreed to support either of them for governor, there would have  been reason to fear that the measure would have been imputed to party,  and not to a desire of relieving our country from the evils they  experience from the heats of party. It appeared, therefore, most  advisable to elect some man of the opposite party, in whose integrity,  patriotism, and temper, confidence might be placed, however little his  political opinions on the question lately agitated might be approved  by those who were assembled upon that occasion.    \"Among the persons of this description, there were circumstances which  led to a decision in favour of Judge Yates. It is certain that as a  man and a judge he is generally esteemed. And, though his opposition  to the new Constitution was such as his friends cannot but disapprove,  yet, since the period of its adoption, his conduct has been tempered  with a degree of moderation, and seems to point him out as a man  likely to compose the differences of the State. Of this at least we  feel confident, that he has no personal revenge to gratify, no  opponents to oppress, no partisans to provide for, nor any promises  for personal purposes to be performed at the public expense.\"[50]    [Footnote 50: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 1, p. 509.]    To many the selection of Robert Yates seemed almost ungracious. The  Federalists wanted Richard Morris, chief justice of the Supreme Court,  who had encouraged the establishment of a strong government, and, as a  member of the Poughkeepsie convention, had voted to ratify the Federal  Constitution. Besides, he was a gentleman of the old school, of  inflexible integrity, firm and decided in character, whose full,  rounded face and commanding presence appeared to advantage among the  stately and dignified personages who supported knee breeches and silk  stockings, and displayed the delicate ruffles of a shirt under the  folds of a rich velvet coat. Hamilton was fond of Morris, and  recognised the justice of his claims. Their views in no wise differed,  their families were intimate, and at the Poughkeepsie convention,  after listening for three hours to Hamilton's speech, Morris had  pronounced it the ablest argument and most patriotic address ever  heard in the State of New York. But the great Federalist, determined  to destroy Clinton, wanted availability, not fidelity, and so Morris  declined in favour of Yates.    In everything Robert Yates was an anti-Federalist. He dressed like one  and he talked like one. He had been an opponent of the Federal  Constitution, an advocate of the doctrine of state supremacy, and an  ardent supporter of the Governor. With Clinton's approval he had  withdrawn from the Philadelphia convention when the majority favoured  a strong government wielding supreme authority; with Clinton's  approval, he had opposed the ratification of the Federal Constitution  in the state convention at Poughkeepsie, and with Clinton's approval  he declined to change his vote, although New Hampshire's action and  Hamilton's speech had already settled the question of ratification.  What Hamilton proposed, Yates opposed; what Clinton advocated, Yates  approved. After the ratification of the Constitution, however, Robert  Yates charged the grand jury that it would be little short of treason  against the Republic to disobey it. \"Let me exhort you, gentlemen,\" he  said, \"not only in your capacity as grand jurors, but in your more  durable and equally respectable character as citizens, to preserve  inviolate this charter of our national rights and safety, a charter  second only in dignity and importance to the Declaration of our  Independence.\"    Upon the bench Yates distinguished himself for impartiality and  independence, if not for learning. He abated the intemperate zeal of  patriotic juries, and he refused to convict men suspected of  disloyalty, without proof. On one occasion he sent a jury back four  times to reconsider a verdict of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22594"],[0,"Colonial Records of Virginia (#9)"],[1,"restitution to the said Indians, and shall forfaict, if  he be a freeholder, five pound; if a servant, 40^s, or endure a  whipping; and anything under the value of 13^d[360] shall be accounted  Petty larceny.

Whereupon  the General[416] Assembly, having throughly heard and considered his  speaches, did constitute this order following against him:    AUG. 4^{th}, 1619.    This day Captaine Henry Spelman[417] was convented before the General  Assembly and was examined by a relation upon oath of one Robert Poole,  Interpreter, what conference had passed between the said Spelman[418]  and Opochancano at Poole's meeting with him in Opochancano's courte.  Poole chardgeth him he spake very unreverently and maliciously  against[419] this present Govern^r,[420] wherby the honour and dignity  of his place and person, and so of the whole Colonie, might be brought  into contempte, by w^{ch} meanes what mischiefs might ensue from the  Indians by disturbance of the peace or otherwise, may easily be  conjectured. Some thinges of this relation Spelman confessed, but the  most parte he denyed, excepte onely one matter of importance, & that was  that he hade informed Opochancano that w^{th}in a yeare there would come  a Governo^r[421] greatter then[422] this that nowe is in place. By  w^{ch} and by other reportes it seemeth he hath alienated the minde of  Opochancano from this present Governour, and brought him in much  disesteem, both w^{th} Opochancano[423] and the Indians, and the whole  Colony in danger of their slippery designes.
