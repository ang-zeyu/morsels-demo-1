[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#16)"],[1,"(80-51 B.C.),  Cleopatra's father, was nicknamed \"the flute player.\"    In Rome, this lack of poetic vitality seemed evident from the  beginning; for while Greece was represented by the tragedy  and comedy, the Romans' preference was for mere pantomime,  a species of farce of which they possessed three kinds:  (1) The simple pantomime without chorus, in which the actors  made the plot clear to the audience by means of gestures and  dancing. (2) Another which called for a band of instrumental  musicians on the stage to furnish an accompaniment to the  acting of the pantomimist. (3) The chorus pantomime, in  which the chorus and the orchestra were placed on the stage,  supplementing the gestures of the actors by singing a narrative  of the plot of the pantomime, and playing on their instruments.  The latter also were expressive of the non-ideal character of  the pantomime, as is indicated by the fact that the orchestra  was composed of cymbals, gongs, castanets, foot castanets,  rattles, flutes, bagpipes, gigantic lyres, and a kind of shell  or crockery cymbals, which were clashed together.    The Roman theatre itself was not a place connected with the  worship of the gods, as it was with the Greeks. The altar  to Dionysus had disappeared from the centre of the orchestra,  and the chorus, or rather the band, was placed upon the stage  with the actors. The bagpipe now appears for the first time in  musical history, although there is some question as to whether  it was not known to the Assyrians. It represents, perhaps, the  only remnant of Roman music that has survived, for the modern  Italian peasants probably play in much the same way as did their  forefathers. The Roman pipes were bound with brass, and had  about the same power of tone as was obtained from the trumpet.    It is easy to see that an orchestra thus constituted would  be better adapted for making a great noise than for music,  while the pantomime itself was of such a brutal nature that  the degradation of art may be said to have been complete. As  the decay of art in Egypt culminated under Ptolemy Auletes,  so in Rome it culminated in the time of Caligula (12-41 A.D.),  and Nero (37-68 A.D.).    The latter, as we learn from Suetonius, competed for prizes  in the public musical contests, and was never without a slave  at his elbow to warn him against straining his voice. In  his love of magnificence he resembled a Greek flute player,  with unbounded means to gratify it. His palace, the \"Golden  House,\" had triple porticos a mile in length, and enclosed  a lake surrounded by buildings which had the appearance of a  city. Within its area were corn fields, vineyards, pastures,  and woods containing many animals, both wild and tame. In  other parts it was entirely overlaid with gold, and adorned  with jewels and mother-of-pearl. The porch was so high that  a colossal statue of himself, one hundred and twenty feet  in height, stood in it. The supper rooms were vaulted, and  compartments of the ceiling, inlaid with ivory, were made to  revolve and scatter flowers; they also contained pipes which  shed perfumes upon the guests.    When the revolt under Vindex broke out (68 A.D.), a new  instrument had just been brought to Rome. Tertullian, Suetonius,  and Vitruvius agree in calling it an organ. This instrument,  which was the invention of Ctesibus of Alexandria, consisted  of a set of pipes through which the air was made to vibrate  by means of a kind of water pump operated by iron keys. It  was undoubtedly the direct ancestor of our modern organ. Nero  intended to introduce these instruments into the Roman theatre.  In planning for his expedition against Vindex, his first  care was to provide carriages for his musical instruments;  for his intention was to sing songs of triumph after having  quelled the revolt. He publicly vowed that if his power in the  state were reestablished, he would include a performance upon  organs as well as upon flutes and bagpipes, in the exhibitions  he intended to institute in honour of his success.    From a musical point of view, Suetonius's biography of Nero  is interesting chiefly on account of its giving us glimpses  of the life of a professional musician of those days. We read,  together with many other details, that it was the custom for a  singer to lie on his back, with a sheet of lead upon his breast,  to correct unsteadiness in breathing, and to abstain from food  for two days together to clear his voice, often denying himself  fruit and sweet pastry. The degraded state of the theatre may  well be imagined from the fact that under Nero the custom of  hiring professional applause was instituted. After his death,  which is so dramatically told by Suetonius, music never revived  in Rome.    In the meanwhile, however, a new kind of music had begun;  in the catacombs and underground vaults, the early Christians  were chanting their first hymns. Like all that we call \"new,\"  this music had its roots in the old. The hymns sung by the  Christians were mainly Hebrew temple songs, strangely changed  into an uncouth imitation of the ancient Greek drama or worship  of Dionysus; for example, Philo of Alexandria, as well as Pliny  the Younger, speaks of the Christians as accompanying their  songs with gestures, and with steps forward and backward. This  Greek influence is still further implied by the order of one  of the earliest of the Church fathers, Clement of Alexandria  (about 300 A.D.), who forbade the use of the chromatic style in  the hymns, as tending too much toward paganism. Some writers  even go so far as to identify many of the Christian myths and  symbols with those of Greece. For instance, they see, in the  story of Daniel in the lions' den, another form of the legend of  Orpheus taming the wild beasts; in Jonah, they recognize Arion  and the dolphin; and the symbol of the Good Shepherd, carrying  home the stray lamb on his shoulders, is considered another  form of the familiar Greek figure of Hermes carrying the goat.    Be this as it may, it is certain that this crude beginning  of Christian music arose from a vital necessity, and was  accompanied by an indomitable faith. If we look back, we note  that until now music had either been the servant of ignoble  masters, looked upon as a mathematical problem to be solved  scientifically, or used according to methods prescribed by  the state. It had been dragged down to the lowest depths of  sensuality by the dance, and its divine origin forgotten in  lilting rhythms and soft, lulling rhymes.    On the other hand, the mathematicians, in their cold  calculation, reduced music to the utilitarianism of algebra,  and even viewed it as a kind of medicine for the nerves and  mind. When we think of the music of Pythagoras and his school,  we seem to be in a kind of laboratory in which all the tones  are labelled and have their special directions for use. For  the legend runs that he composed melodies in the diatonic,  chromatic, and enharmonic styles as antidotes for moods such  as anger, fear, sorrow, etc., and invented new rhythms which  he used to steady and strengthen the mind, and to produce  simplicity of character in his disciples. He recommended that  every morning, after rising, they should play on the lyre and  sing, in order to clear the mind. It was inevitable that this  half mathematical, half psychologically medicinal manner of  treating music would, in falling into the hands of Euclid  (300 B.C.) and his school, degenerate into a mere peg on  which to hang mathematical theorems. On the other hand, when  we think of Greek dances, we seem to pass into the bright,  warm sunshine. We see graceful figures holding one another by  the wrist, dancing in a circle around some altar to Dionysus,  and singing to the strange lilt of those unequal measures. We  can imagine the scheme of colour to be white and gold, framed  by the deep-blue arch of the sky, the amethyst sea flecked  with glittering silver foam, and the dark, sombre rocks of the  Cretan coast bringing a suggestion of fate into this dancing,  soulless vision. Turning now to Rome, we see that this same  music has fallen to a wretched slave's estate, cowering in some  corner until the screams of Nero's living torches need to be  drowned; and then, with brazen clangour and unabashed rhythms,  this brutal music flaunts forth with swarms of dancing slaves,  shrilling out the praises of Nero; and the time for successful  revolution is at hand.    The first steps toward actually defining the new music took  place in the second century, when the Christians were free to  worship more openly, and, having wealthy converts among them,  held their meetings in public places and basilicas which were  used by magistrates and other officials during the day. These  basilicas or public halls had a raised platform at one end, on  which the magistrate sat when in office. There were steps up to  it, and on these steps the clergy stood. The rest of the hall  was called the \"nave\" (ship), for the simile of \"storm-tossed  mariners\" was always dear to the early Christian church. In the  centre of the nave stood the reader of the Scriptures, and on  each side of him, ranged along the wall, were the singers. The  Psalms were sung antiphonally, that is, first one side would  sing and the other side would answer. The congregations  were sometimes immense, for according to St. Jerome (340-420  A.D.) and St. Ambrose (340-397 A.D.) \"the roofs reechoed with  their cries of 'Alleluia,' which in sound were like the great  waves of the surging sea.\"    Nevertheless this was, as yet, only sound, and not music. Not  until many centuries later did music become distinct from  chanting, which is merely intoned _speech_. The disputes  of the Arians and the Athanasians also affected the music of  the church, for as early as 306 A.D., Arius introduced many  secular melodies, and had them sung by women.    Passing over this, we find that the first"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#16)"],[1,"it  must any one, that those who have only partially learned a language  continually vary their methods of uttering its words.    That some words have come from one source and been aided by another, is  continually apparent in English Gipsy, as for instance in the word for  reins, \"guiders,\" which, until the Rommany reached England, was voidas.  In this instance the resemblance in sound between the words undoubtedly  conduced to an union.  Gibberish may have come from the Gipsy, and at the  same time owe something to _gabble_, _jabber_, and the old Norse or  Icelandic _gifra_.  _Lush_ may owe something to Mr Lushington, something  to the earlier English _lush_, or rosy, and something to the Gipsy and  Sanskrit.  It is not at all unlikely that the word _codger_ owes, through  _cadger_, a part of its being to _kid_, a basket, as Mr Halliwell  suggests (Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words, 1852), and yet come  quite as directly from _gorger_ or _gorgio_.  \"The cheese\" probably has  the Gipsy-Hidustani _chiz_ for a father, and the French _chose_ for a  mother, while both originally sprung thousands of years ago in the great  parting of the Aryan nations, to be united after so long a separation in  a distant island in the far northern seas.    The etymologist who hesitates to adopt this principle of joint sources of  derivation, will find abundant instances of something very like it in  many English Gipsy words themselves, which, as belonging to a language in  extreme decay, have been formed directly from different, but somewhat  similarly sounding, words, in the parent German or Eastern Rommany.  Thus,  _schukker_, pretty; _bi-shukker_, slow; _tschukko_, dry, and  _tschororanes_, secretly, have in England all united in _shukar_, which  expresses all of their meanings.          CHAPTER VII.  PROVERBS AND CHANCE PHRASES.      An Old Gipsy Proverb--Common Proverbs in Gipsy Dress--Quaint  Sayings--Characteristic Rommany Picture-Phrases.    Every race has not only its peculiar proverbs, sayings, and catch-words,  but also idiomatic phrases which constitute a characteristic chiaroscuro,  if not colour.  The Gipsies in England have of course borrowed much from  the Gorgios, but now and then something of their own appears.  In  illustration of all this, I give the following expressions noted down  from Gipsy conversation:--    _Tacho like my dad_.  True like my father.    _Kushto like my dad_.  Good like my father.    This is a true Gipsy proverb, used as a strongly marked indication of  approbation or belief.    _Kushto bak_.  Good luck!    As the Genoese of old greeted their friends with the word _Guadagna_! or  \"Gain!\" indicating as Rabelais declares, their sordid character, so the  Gipsy, whose life is precarious, and who depends upon chance for his  daily bread, replies to \"Sarishan!\" (good day!) with \"Kushto bak!\" or  \"Good luck to you!\"  The Arabic \"Baksheesh\" is from the same root as bak,  _i.e_., bacht.    _When there's a boro bavol_, _huller the tan parl the waver rikk pauli  the bor_.  When the wind is high, move the tent to the other side of the  hedge behind it.    That is to say, change sides in an emergency.    \"_Hatch apre!  Hushti!  The prastramengro's wellin!  Jal the graias  avree!  Prastee_!\"    \"Jump up!  Wide awake there!  The policeman's coming!  Run the horses  off!  Scamper!\"    This is an alarm in camp, and constitutes a sufficiently graphic picture.  The hint to run the horses off indicates a very doubtful title to their  possession.    _The prastramengro pens me mustn't hatch acai_.    The policeman says we mustn't stop here.    No phrase is heard more frequently among Gipsies, who are continually in  trouble with the police as to their right to stop and pitch their tents  on commons.    _I can hatch apre for pange_ (_panj_) _divvuses_.    I can stop here for five days.    A common phrase indicating content, and equivalent to, \"I would like to  sit here for a week.\"    _The graias have taddered at the kas-stoggus_--_we must jal an  durer_--_the gorgio's dicked us_!    The horses have been pulling at the hay-stack--we must hurry away--the  man has seen us!    When Gipsies have remained over night on a farm, it sometimes happens  that their horses and asses--inadvertently of course--find their way to  the haystacks or into a good field.  _Humanum est errare_!    _Yeck mush can lel a grai ta panni_, _but twenty cant kair him pi_.    One man can take a horse to water, but twenty can't make him drink.    A well-known proverb.    _A chirrico 'dree the mast is worth dui_ '_dree the bor_.    A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush (hedge).    _Never kin a pong dishler nor lel a romni by momeli dood_.    Never buy a handkerchief nor choose a wife by candle-light.    _Always jal by the divvus_.    Always go by the day.    _Chin tutes chuckko by tute's kaum_.    Cut your coat according to your fancy.  This is a Gipsy variation of an  old proverb.    _Fino ranyas kair fino trushnees_.    Nice reeds make nice baskets.    _He can't tool his kokerus togetherus_ (_kettenus_).    He can't hold himself together.  Spoken of an infirm old man.    _Too boot of a mush for his kokero_.    Too much of a man for himself; _i.e_., he thinks too much of himself.    _He_'s _too boot of a mush to rakker a pauveri chavo_.    He's too proud too speak to a poor man.  This was used, not in  depreciation of a certain nobleman, whom the Gipsy who gave it to me had  often seen, but admiringly, as if such _hauteur_ were a commendable  quality.    _More_ (_koomi_) _covvas the well_.    There are more things to come.  Spoken of food on a table, and equivalent  to \"Don't go yet.\"  _The_ appears to be used in this as in many other  instances, instead of _to_ for the sake of euphony.    _The jivaben has jawed avree out of his gad_.    The life has gone out of his shirt, _i.e_., body.  This intimates a long  and close connection between the body and the under garment.  \"Avree out  of,\" a phrase in which the Gipsy word is immediately followed by its  English equivalent, is a common form of expression for the sake of  clearness.    _I toves my own gad_.    I wash my own shirt.    A saying indicating celibacy or independence.    _Mo rakkerfor a pennis when tute can't lel it_.    Don't ask for a thing when you can't get it.    _The wongurs kairs the grasni jal_.    Money makes the mare go.    _It's allers the boro matcho that pet-a-lay 'dree the panni_.    It is always the largest fish that falls back into the water.    _Bengis your see_!  _Beng in tutes bukko_!    The devil in your heart.  The devil in your body, or bowels.    This is a common form of imprecation among Gipsies all over the world.    _Jawin sar a mush mullerin adree the boro naflo-ker_.    Going like a man dying in the hospital.    _Rikker it adree tute's kokero see an' kek'll jin_.    Keep it a secret in your own heart, and nobody will know it.    _Del sar mush a sigaben to hair his jivaben_.  Give every man a chance to  make his living.    _It's sim to a choomer, kushti for kek till it's pordered atween dui_.    It's like a kiss, good for nothing until it is divided between two.    _A cloudy sala often purabens to a fino divvus_.    A cloudy morning often changes to a fine day.    _Iuzhiou panni never jalled avree from a chickli tan_.    Clean water never came out from a dirty place.    _Sar mush must jal to the cangry, yeck divvus or the waver_.    Every man must go to the church (_i.e_., be buried) some day or other.    _Kek mush ever lelled adusta mongur_.    No man ever got money enough.    _Pale the wafri bak jals the kushti bak_.    Behind bad luck comes good luck.    _Saw mushis ain't got the sim kammoben as wavers_.    All men have not the same tastes.    _Lel the tacho pirro, an' it's pash kaired_.    Well begun is half done.    _Whilst tute's rakkerin the cheiruses jal_.    While you are talking the _times_ (hours) fly.    _Wafri bak in a boro ker_, _sim's adree a bitti her_.    There may be adversity in a large house as well as in a small one.    _The kushtiest covvas allers jal avree siggest_.    The best is soonest gone.    _To dick a puro pal is as cammoben as a kushti habben_.    To see an old friend is as agreeable as a good meal.    _When tuti's pals chinger yeck with a waver_, _don't tute jal adoi_.    When your brothers quarrel don't you meddle.    _Pet up with the rakkerin an' mor pen chichi_.    Endure the chattering and say nothing.    _When a mush dels tute a grai tute man dick 'dree lester's mui_.    When a man gives you a horse you must not look in his mouth.    _Man jal atut the puvius_.    Do not go across the field.  Intimating that one should travel in the  proper road.    _There's a kushti sovaben at the kunsus of a duro drum_.    There is a sweet sleep at the end of a long road.    _Kair the cammodearer_.    Make the best of it.    _Rikker dovo adree tute's see_.    Keep that a secret.    _The koomi foki the tacho_.    The more the merrier.    _The pishom kairs the gudlo_.    The bee makes the honey.  _Id est_, each does his own work.    _The pishom lels the gudlo avree the roozhers_.    The bee gets honey from flowers.  _Id est_, seeks it in the right place.    _Hatch till the dood wells apre_.    Wait till the moon rises.  A very characteristic Gipsy saying.    _Can't pen shukker atut lendy_.    You cannot say aught against them.    _He's boccalo ajaw to haw his chokkas_.    He's hungry enough to eat his shoes.    _The puro beng is a fino mush_!    The devil is a nice character.    _Mansha tu pal_!    Cheer up, brother.  Be a man!  Spoken to any one who seems dejected.  This  corresponds partially to the German Gipsy _Manuschwari_! which is,  however, rather an evil wish and a curse, meaning according to Dr Liebich  (_Die Zigeuner_) the gallows, dire need, and epilepsy.  Both in English  and German it is, however, derived from Manusch, a man.    _He's a hunnalo nakin mush_.    He is an avaricious man.  Literally, a spiteful"]]]
