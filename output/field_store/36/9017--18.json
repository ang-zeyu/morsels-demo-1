That a requisite number of these should be fit for the present purposes  of labour, and for an immediate initiation into the mechanic arts, as  applicable to the local circumstances of the colony, and the useful  purposes of life.    4th. That a proportionate number of males and females should form the  complement, from the age of 5 to 7 years, and be placed in a seminary of  instruction, under the inspection of the government of the colony, and  under tutors approved of in England.    5th. That this establishment of a seminary of instruction in Africa, under  the administration of the colony, shall have for its bases the initiation  of these children, as calculated to their sexes, into the rudiments of  letters, religion, and science, and the progressive operation of education  adapted to the useful purposes of life.    6th. That when thus prepared, the necessary avocations of domestic economy,  agriculture, and mechanics, employ the next period of their existence,  under the superintendence of the European colonist.    7th. When arrived at the period of mature years, and thus instructed, to  become the object of legislative enquiry and investigation as to their  attainments, character, fidelity, and mental improvement.    8th. That such as produce clear testimonials of capacity, knowledge, and  acquirement, become immediately objects of manumission.    9th. That all proceedings in this process of education and emancipation,  become matters of record in the colony, subject to such control and  investigation as his Majesty's Government may, in its wisdom, appoint, from  time to time, to guard against the corruption and prejudices of the  legislative authority of the colony.    10th. That thus endowed, they are to be dismissed to their respective  countries and nations, employed as agents in various capacities of  civilized pursuit, and to promote the commercial and agricultural views of  the colony, and disseminate their allurements among their tribe, which,  under the direction of the unerring dispensations of divine providence,  might, in process of time, diffuse civilization and Christianity throughout  the utmost region of Africa, its inhabitants become members of civilized  and Christian society, and their country, in process of time, be extricated  from its barbarism.    It is for the legislature to devise a system adapted to the colonies,  calculated to their local situations, and to remove the invidious  distinction now subsisting between the African there, and in his native  country; by these means the entire Negro race may participate in the  blessings of civilization and revealed religion, in every quarter where our  extensive dominion and influence exist.    By adopting the _first proposition_, a sufficient authority would be  maintained to enforce the labour necessary to produce profit, and competent  to excite emulation, which is a powerful passion in the character of the  African; for in every effort he discovers a strong spirit of competition.    Through the medium of the 2d proposition, the natives of an extentive  district would be collected under the instruction of the European colonist,  and, in process of time, would become the happy instruments of initiating  their, tribe or nation into the arts of civilization, and in promoting the  commercial interests of the colony, which may eventually be diffused  throughout Africa.    By the 3d expedient, an adequate portion of effective labourers would be  obtained to commence vigorous operations.    In consequence of the 4th, 5th, and 6th, a portion of children of both  sexes would be procured at a moderate rate, in their unadulterated  condition, who would be susceptible of any impressions, free from the  control of their parents, and the contamination of their example, into  whose tender minds might be instilled the principles of moral virtue,  religious knowledge, and the civil arts of life.    Through the adoption of the 7th and 8th, the objects of humanity might be  realized, and slavery, with the slave trade, make a natural exit from the  shores and country of Africa.    By the 9th, the corrupted and interested endeavours of the colonists to  retard the work of emancipation would be controlled; and, by the patronage  of Government, pecuniary resource and support be obtained, in aid of  individual and corporate endeavours, the requisite population from the  parent state acquired, and the indispensible authority established to  secure success to any further attempts at colonization upon the coast of  Africa.    And through the 10th expedient, an extended population would enjoy the  advantages of instruction and example, and our ascendency and commerce be  increased by a rapid process, which would predispose the natives to throw  open the avenues of their country to our enterprize and research.    Thus may the long seclusion of the African from the light of truth and  revealed religion be annihilated, his inveterate jealousies allayed, his  nature regenerated, and his barbarism fall before the emanations of  enlightened existence. In the interim, an unobscured path to the interior  of his country will be opened, and our commerce therewith flow through a  less polluted channel; while the Negro, now the victim of barbarism in his  native land, may be extricated from his thraldom, and received into the  circle of civilized life, which he has hitherto been excluded from, and to  which providence, without doubt, in its mysterious and incomprehensible  administration of human affairs, has designed him to arrive at.    [Footnote 1: A portion of them being destined to domestic slavery, as  victims to revenge, and as sacrifices to their barbarous customs.]          CHAPTER VIII.          _What the Author conceives should be the System of Establishment to make  effectual the Operations from Cape Verde to Cape Palmas.--Reasons for  subjecting the Whole to one Superior and controlling Administration.--The  Situations, in his Estimation, where principal Depots may be established,  and auxiliary Factories placed, &c. &c._    What I have already said respecting the coast from Cape Verde to Cape  Palmas, may be sufficient to convey a tolerably just and general idea of  the religion, customs, and character of the inhabitants, the commercial  resources with which it abounds, and the system to be pursued to unite  commerce with the claims of humanity in one harmonious compact.    I am persuaded there is no situation on the Windward Coast of Africa more  calculated, or more advantageously situated, than the river of Sierra Leone  to influence and command an enlarged portion of the continent of Africa.    This part of Africa, as ascertained by Mr. Park, communicates, by its  rivers to the Niger, and introduces us to the interior of this great  continent; and, from other sources of information, Foolahs, Mandingos, &c.  I am enabled to confirm the statement given in one of the reports of the  Sierra Leone Company, that from _Teembo_, about 270 miles interior to the  entrance of the Rio Noonez, and the capital of the Foolah king, a path of  communication exists through the kingdoms of Bellia, Bourea, Munda, Segoo  (where there are too strong grounds to believe that the enterprising spirit  of Mr. Park ceased its researches in this world), Soofundoo to Genah, and  from thence to Tombuctoo, described as extremely rich and populous. The  distance from Teembo to Tombuctoo the natives estimate at about four moons'  journey, which at 20 miles per day, calculating 30 days to each moon, is  equal to 2,400 miles. This distance in a country like Africa, obscured by  every impediment which forests, desarts, and intense climate can oppose to  the traveller, is immense; and when it is considered that in addition to  these, he has to contend with the barbarism of the inhabitants, it is a  subject for serious deliberation, before the investigation of its natural  history and commercial resources is undertaken. But it also displays an  animating field of enterprise to obtain a free intercourse with this  unbounded space, and if, at a future day, we should traverse it with  freedom and safety, the whole of Africa might thereby be enlightened, and  its mysteries developed  to the civilized world.    I have therefore conceived the expediency of submitting all the enterprises  and operations of the United Kingdom to the influence of a supreme  direction and government in the river of Sierra Leone. No doubt many  contradictory opinions may prevail upon this subject, and upon the outline  I have previously submitted on the most eligible plan of introducing  civilization into Africa; but the detail of all my motives and reasons  would occupy too large a space; I shall therefore proceed to instance some  local circumstances and political reasons why I make the proposition.    From what I have said respecting the path which Smart, of the Rochell  branch of the river Sierra Leone, has now under his authority, and can open  and shut at pleasure, communicating with the extensive country of the  Foolahs, whose king (as the Sierra Leone agents are well aware of, but who  was strangely and unaccountably neglected by them) is well disposed to aid,  by prudent application, all advances towards the civilization of his  country, it is evident that an immense commerce, extending northward to  Cape Verde, and southward to Cape Palmas, on the coasts, and from the  interior countries, might be maintained.    By light vessels and schooners, drawing from 6 to 8 feet water, a continued  activity might be kept up in the maritime situations and rivers, and a  correspondence by land might be conducted by post natives, who travel from  20 to 30 miles per day, to all parts of the interior countries.    From the Island of Goree a correspondence with the river Gambia, and a  watchful vigilance over the settlement of the French in the Senegal would  be maintained both "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#16)"],[1,"up when he was only blood which  fell from you.\" [163] \"Why do you say that you are not my mother?\" said  Kadayadawan to the _alan_. Langa-an said to the _alan_, \"It is good  if he is my son.\" They were very happy and they said to Aponibalagen,  \"Now we will pay the marriage price and also the price which Gawigawen  paid before, we will repay to him.\" Aponibalagen agreed, \"You fill  my _balaua_ nine times with valuable things.\" Not long after they  filled the _balaua_ nine times with valuable things and they repaid  Gawigawen what he had paid when he married Aponibolinayen. When they  had paid they danced again. \"Ala, now we must go home, for we have  staid here a month,\" said the people from the other towns. So they  went home and they took Aponibolinayen's marriage price.    \"Ala, now my cousin _alan_, we are going to take Aponitolau [164]  home for you have said he is our son,\" and the _alan_ said, \"Yes,  take all of my things. I took him for I had no children to inherit  my possessions.\" So they took them to Kadalayapan. The _alan_ went  to the other part of the world, and Langa-an used magic so that the  golden house which the _alan_ gave to Aponitolau went to their town  of Kadalayapan. Not long after the golden house arrived and the people  were surprised when they woke up in the morning and saw the big golden  house. Not long after Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen and their father  arrived there.    (Told by Magwati of Lagangilang.)        6    There was a woman whose name was Ginambo of Gonigonan, who went to  fight Aponibolinayen of Kaodanan. When she reached the place where  the spring was she said, \"You people who are dipping water from the  spring, whose place is this where the spring is?\" \"It belongs to  Aponibolinayen of Kaodanan,\" they said and when they went up to the  town they raised a clamor. \"What are you so noisy about, you women who  are like me?\" said Aponibolinayen. \"You ask why we are noisy? Because  there are many women, who have come to fight against you, at the place  where the spring is,\" they said, and Aponibolinayen hurried to take her  spear. \"What are you so noisy for, women like Aponibolinayen?\" asked  her father Pagatipanan. \"What are we noisy about, you ask? Because  there are many of my enemies at the spring.\" \"Do not go Aponibolinayen,  for I will go.\" \"No for you are weak. What can you do now? Once you did  kill people in the place where the spring is, and now perhaps it is my  fortune,\" she said, and she went to the spring. She looked down and  truly the enemies looked like many locusts about the spring. \"Ala,\"  said Ginambo of Gonigonan, \"You people who live with me, you are  anxious to carry away this woman whom we do not like.\" \"Yes,\" they  answered, \"but only our names will go back to the towns we came from,\"  i.e. they expected to be killed. Ginambo answered, \"No, we are anxious  to capture her without fail.\"    Aponibolinayen said, \"You old enemy take this betel-nut,\" and she cut  it in two and gave it to them. \"How are we sure Ginambo of Gonigonan  that only our names will not go back, we are afraid.\" Ginambo said,  \"Do not be afraid, but hurry to be brave.\" \"Ala, now do what you can,\"  shouted Aponibolinayen who stood on a high rock. When they started  toward Aponibolinayen their spears looked like rain they were so  many. She glanced off the spears with both elbows. \"Now I am the  next to throw my spears,\" said Aponibolinayen. \"Yes, because all our  weapons are gone,\" they said.    Aponibolinayen was next, she said, \"I will use my magic, and you,  my spear, shall kill six and seven at one time, and you, my headaxe,  cut off their heads from the left side and from the right side, and in  back and in front.\" \"Ala, you spare me so that I may tell the people  in Gonigonan where I live,\" said Ginambo. \"Yes, but next month I will  come to your town Gonigonan to fight,\" said Aponibolinayen.    Ginambo went home alone to her town. \"Why are you alone?\" asked the  people who lived in the same town when she arrived. \"What can we do,  all my companions who went to fight are lost, because they did not  throw their spears at Aponibolinayen.\" \"That is what we told you  Ginambo of Gonigonan when you started, but you did not heed, you know  that the people of Kaodanan are powerful like Kaboniyan.\" [165]    Soon after that Ginawan of Nagtinawan said, \"You people who live  in the same town in which I live, let us go to fight Aponigawani of  Kadalayapan.\" \"No, we do not wish to go, because the people who live  in Kadalayapan are powerful like Kaboniyan. We do not know whether  she has a brother or not though someone has said that Aponigawani  has no brother.\" \"No we go,\" said Ginawan. \"If that is what you  say, we will go,\" said the people. So they went and they walked and  walked until they reached the spring at Kadalayapan. Ginawan said,  \"You women who are dipping water from the spring, to whom does it  belong?\" \"To Aponigawani,\" they said. Ginawan said, \"Ala, you go and  tell your bravest that we fight with steel weapons.\" The women who  dipped water from the well said, \"We do not know who is the bravest,  whom we should tell, for Aponigawani has no brother.\" They went up to  the town, and said, \"Uncle Pagbokasan the place about the spring is  filled with enemies.\" Then Aponigawani was in a hurry to go. \"Do not  go you will kill somebody,\" said her father. \"No, father, the spring  will be lost and then what can we do? Father, I am a woman and since I  have no brother, perhaps it is my fortune to fight, for you are weak.\"    She took her skirt, headaxe, and spear and she went to the edge of  the hill above the spring. She looked and looked at the place where  the spring was for truly the enemies were thick like locusts about  the well. \"What did you come for?\" she asked. \"We come to fight the  people who live in Kadalayapan, because we have heard that the woman  who is always in the house [166] has no brother, so we have come to  carry her away,\" they said. \"Ala, if you wish to prove her bravery  you take this betel-nut.\" She cut it in two pieces and gave it to  them. \"We asked you to excuse us from going Ginawan,\" they said. \"Ala,  you begin and see what you can do,\" said Aponigawani who stood on  a high stone and she stood with her hands on her hips while they  threw their weapons. \"Now, I am next,\" she said. \"You, my spear,  when I throw you, kill at once seven and six; and you, my headaxe,  cut off their heads from the left and right sides, from in back and in  front.\" When Aponigawani had killed all of them except Ginawan and she  had all their weapons, Ginawan said, \"Please, my friend, let me live  so that someone may go back to the town we came from.\" \"Ala, yes, if  that is what you ask, my friend, but I will come next to your town,\"  she said, and Ginawan went home alone. Not long after that the month  which they had agreed on came.    \"Now, mother, go and make cakes and after that I will go to fight,\"  said Aponibolinayen. \"Do not go,\" said her mother Ebang of Kaodanan,  but she could not detain her, so she made the cake, and when she  finished, Aponibolinayen went.    \"Mother, make preparations for me to go to war, for this is the month  we agreed upon with Ginawan of Nagtinawan,\" said Aponigawani to her  mother Langa-an of Kadalayapan.    Bye and bye Aponibolinayen who was walking in the middle of the road,  stopped because she was tired. Aponigawani was also walking and  when she looked up she saw a woman to whom none compared, and she  was startled, and she said, \"Here is a woman who looks like me. I  do not like to approach her who looks like me, yet I am ashamed  not to do so, for she has seen me,\" she said. \"Good morning,\"  said Aponigawani to Aponibolinayen who sat on a high stone by the  road. They leaned their spears together between them and then they  talked. \"Now, my friend, where are you going,\" said Aponibolinayen. \"I  am going to war,\" said Aponigawani. \"And where are you going?\" said  Aponigawani to Aponibolinayen. \"I am going to Gonigonan, because the  month which I agreed upon with Ginambo of Gonigonan has come,\" said  Aponibolinayen. \"Ala, let us chew betel-nut.\" \"Yes, if that is what  you say, we will chew betel-nut,\" said Aponigawani. After that they  exchanged quids. And the quid which had been chewed by Aponigawani was  covered with agate beads which are called _pinogalan_, and the quid  of Aponibolinayen was covered with gold. Aponigawani said, \"You are  more beautiful and have more power than I, because your betel-nut is  covered with gold.\" After that they spat in front of them. The place  looked like the place where a child had been born. \"Now, my friend,  we are going to tell our names.\" \"Yes,\" said each one, and they told  their names. \"I am Aponibolinayen of Kaodanan who has no brother,  and Ginambo of Gonigonan came to fight against me and the month in  which we agreed to fight has come, so I go meet her.\" \"I go also  to the town of Ginawan of Nagtinawan, because the month which we  agreed on has arrived, my name is Aponigawani of Kadalayapan who  also has no brother.\" \"If that is what you are going to do, we will  go first to Gonigonan, then we will go to the town of Nagtinawan,\"  said Aponibolinayen to her. \"If that is what you say we will both  go.\" So they went.    Not long after they arrived at Gonigonan. \"Now, Ginambo of Gonigonan I  am here because the month which we agreed has come.\" \"You people who  live in the same town with me prepare, because the woman who always  stays in the house in Kaodanan has come to fight against us,\" said  Ginambo. \"Yes, Ginambo, we will fight against her. We told you not to  go against her before, because the people of her town are related to  Kaboniyan. We do not know what magic they may use,\" they said. \"Now,  what can we do, we are lost.\" After that they began to fight. \"Ala,  you my spears and headaxes kill the people from the left and the right  sides, from in back and in front,\" said"]]]
