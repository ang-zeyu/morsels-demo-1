[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#16)"],[1,"as yet no apparent part  in the religious movement of modern Barbary.    The Mussulman princes of India hold a very similar position. Opposed as  they soon may be, indeed must be if the unintelligent English policy of  the last twenty years be persevered in, to an European Government in  arms, they will have the chance of making themselves a leading position  in the eyes of Islam; and should a Mohammedan empire arise once more at  Delhi or Hyderabad, India would certainly become _par excellence_ the  Dar el Islam. It would then be by far the richest and most populous of  Mohammedan states, and able to outbid any other with the surrah it could  send to Mecca.    The Wakaf property in India at the present day is supposed to be as  valuable as that in the Ottoman empire, and it would then become a  source of patronage with the Government, instead of being privately  remitted as now. If money alone could buy the Caliphate, a successful  leader of revolt against the English in India might dictate his terms to  Islam. But again the insuperable obstacle intervenes of distance and the  sea. Mussulman India could never give that protection to Mecca that  Islam needs, and could not assert its sovereignty anywhere but at home,  in arms. Even this is assuming, as in the case of Barbary, an enormous  postulate--success.    Neither India, then, nor Western Africa can reasonably be expected to  supply that substitute for the House of Othman which we need. A more  apparent and in the opinion of some a likely candidate for the Caliphate  succession may be looked for in the Viceregal family of Egypt. Mohammed  Towfik, if he were a man of genius like his grandfather, or if, honest  man as he is, he plays his cards with success, might in a few years  become an important rival at Mecca to the Sultan. To say nothing of its  traditional connection with the Caliphate, Egypt has the more modern  recollection of Mehemet Ali to urge upon the Hejazi in its favour as the  protecting State of Islam.    Mehemet Ali's name and that of his successor Ibrahim Pasha, if not  precisely popular, are at least respected at Mecca; and the latter  possesses a great title to Sunite gratitude in having destroyed the  Wahhabite empire in 1818. I have mentioned Mehemet Ali's ambition; and a  similar ambition would seem to have occurred to Ismail, the late  Khedive. He, in the plenitude of his financial power, is stated to have  expended large sums of money in subsidising the Sherifs with a view to  possible contingencies at Constantinople. But unfortunately for him the  opening of the Suez Canal, on which he had counted for securing him the  support of Europe, proved the precise instrument of ruin for his scheme.    The Porte in 1871, scenting danger to its own Caliphal pretensions from  this quarter, occupied the Red Sea in force, reinforced its garrisons in  Jeddah and Yembo, advanced to Taif, and threw a large army into Yemen.  This was alone made possible by the Canal, and Ismail to his chagrin  found himself \"hoist with his own petard.\" Mohammed Towfik, therefore,  would have some excuse in family tradition if he indulged occasionally  in dreams of a similar nature. His connection with Mecca is at the  present day second only to that of Constantinople; the Egyptian  Khedivieh line of steamers ply constantly between Suez and Jeddah; and  the Haj the Khedive sends to Mecca, including as it does most of the  Mogrebbin pilgrims, is more numerous than the Sultan's. He maintains  intimate relations with one at least of the great Sherifal families, and  sends a Mahmal yearly with an important surrah to Medina. Mohammed  Towfik also has the deserved reputation of being a sincere Mussulman and  an honest man, and it is certain that a large section of true liberal  opinion looks to him as the worthiest supporter of its views. With all  this I doubt if he be big enough a man to aspire as yet with success to  Abd el Hamid's succession.    The present Viceroy's financial position, though we may hope sounder in  its base, is not so immediately powerful as his father's; and much ready  money will be required by an aspirant to the Caliphate. His fighting  power, too, is small, and he would have to proclaim himself in arms.  Moreover--and this I fear will remain an insuperable difficulty--he is  hampered with the control of Europe. Islam would hardly obey another  Caliph who was himself obedient to Christendom; and the same causes  which have ruined the House of Othman, would also ruin him. A Caliph, as  things stand, cannot legally govern, except by the old canon law of the  Sheriat, and though a lapsus from strict observance may be tolerated in  an ordinary prince, or even in a well established Caliph, a new Caliph  putting forward a new claim would be more strictly bound. How could  Mohammed Towfik's necessity to Islam be reconciled to his necessity to  Europe? Between the two stools he hardly could avert a fall.[15]    Unless, then, some unexpected religious hero should appear in Eastern  Asia, of which as yet there is no sign, we are driven to Arabia for a  solution of the difficulty where to establish a Mussulman theocracy, and  to the Sherifal family of Mecca itself for a new dynasty.    The family of the Sherifs has this vast advantage over any other  possible competitor to the supreme title of Islam, that it is of the  acknowledged blood of that tribe of Koreysh which Mohammed himself  designated as his heirs. Amongst many other passages of authority which  bear upon the rights of the Koreysh the following seem to me the most  explicit and the best worth quoting: \"The prophet,\" says a tradition of  Omm Hani, daughter of Abutaleb, \"exalted the Koreysh by conferring on  them seven prerogatives: the first, the _Nebbuwat_ (the fact that they  had given birth to a prophet); the second, the _Khalafat_ (the  succession); the third, the _Hejabat_ (the guardianship of the Kaaba);  the fourth, the _Sikayat_ (the right of supplying water to the Haj); the  fifth, the _Refadat_ (the right of entertaining the Haj); the sixth, the  _Nedwat_ (the right of counsel, government); and the seventh, the _Lewa_  (possession of the banner, with the right of proclaiming war).\" The  prophet also, according to another tradition, said, \"As long as there  remains one man of the Koreysh, so long shall that man be my successor;\"  and as to the Arab race, \"If the Arab race falls Islam shall fall.\" All  the world knows these things, and to the popular mind, especially, the  Sherif is already far more truly the representative of spiritual rank  than any Sultan or Caliph is.    The vast populations of Southern and Eastern Asia send out their  pilgrims, not to Constantinople but to Mecca, and it is the Sherif whom  they find there supreme. The Turkish Government in Hejaz holds a  comparatively insignificant position, and the Sultan's representative at  Jeddah is hardly more than servant to the Prince of Mecca. It is he who  is the descendant of their prophet, not the other, and though the  learned may make distinctions in favour of the Caliph the Haj only hears  of the Sherif. Even at Constantinople, by immemorial custom, the Sultan  rises to receive members of the sacred family; and at Mecca it is  commonly said that should a Sultan make the Haj in person he would be  received by the Grand Sherif as an inferior. The Sherifal family, then,  is surrounded with a halo of religious prestige which would make their  acquisition of the supreme temporal title appear natural to all but the  races who have been in subjection to the Ottomans; and were a man of  real ability to appear amongst them he would, in the crisis we have  foreseen, be sure to find an almost universal following.    That the Ottoman Government is perfectly aware of this is certain. Even  in the days of its greatest power it always showed its jealousy and  distrust of Mecca, and was careful when any of the Grand Sherifs  acquired what was considered dangerous influence, to supplant him by  setting up a rival. Its physical power enabled it to do this, and though  it could not abolish the office of the Grand Sherifate, it could  interfere in the order of succession. Family feuds have, therefore, been  at all times fostered by the Turks in Hejaz, and will be, as long as  their presence there is tolerated. An excellent example of their system  has recently been given in the episode of the late Grand Sherif's death,  and the story of it will serve also to show the fear entertained by the  present Sultan of this his great spiritual rival. To tell it properly I  must go back to the epoch of the Wahhabite invasion of Hejaz in 1808.    At that time, and for the latter half of the previous century, the  supreme dignity of the Sherifal House was held by a branch of it known  as the Dewy Zeyd (the word _Dewy_ is used in Hejaz, as are elsewhere  _Beni_ or _Ahl_, meaning _people_, _family_, _house_), which had  replaced in 1750 the Barakat branch, mentioned by Niebuhr as in his day  supreme. The actual holder of the title was Ghaleb ibn Mesaad, and he,  finding himself unable to contend against the Wahhabis, became himself a  Wahhabi. Consequently, when Mehemet Ali appeared at Mecca in 1812, his  first act was to depose this Ghaleb, in spite of his protest that he had  returned to orthodoxy, and to appoint another member of the Sherifal  House in his place.    The Sherif chosen was Yahia ibn Serur, of a rival branch, the Dewy Aoun,  and a bitter animosity was, by this means, engendered between the two  families of Aoun and Zeyd, which is continued to the present day. Nor,  as may be supposed, was this lessened by the subsequent changes rung by  the Turkish and Egyptian Governments in their appointments to the  office, for, in 1827, we find Abd el Mutalleb, the son of the deposed  Wahhabite Ghaleb, reappointed, and in the following year again,  Mohammed, the son of Yahia ibn Aoun, an intrigue which brought on a  civil war. Then in 1848 a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#16)"],[1," are taught and practiced aside from them. For here we can boast and  say: Let all the wise and saints step forth and produce, if they can, a  [single] work like these commandments, upon which God insists with such  earnestness, and which He enjoins with His greatest wrath and  punishment, and, besides, adds such glorious promises that He will pour  out upon us all good things and blessings. Therefore they should be  taught above all others, and be esteemed precious and dear, as the  highest treasure given by God.    Part Second. OF THE CREED.    Thus far we have heard the first part of Christian doctrine, in which  we have seen all that God wishes us to do or to leave undone. Now,  there properly follows the Creed, which sets forth to us everything  that we must expect and receive from God, and, to state it quite  briefly, teaches us to know Him fully. And this is intended to help us  do that which according to the Ten Commandments we ought to do. For (as  said above) they are set so high that all human ability is far too  feeble and weak to [attain to or] keep them. Therefore it is as  necessary to learn this part as the former in order that we may know  how to attain thereto, whence and whereby to obtain such power. For if  we could by our own powers keep the Ten Commandments as they are to be  kept, we would need nothing further, neither the Creed nor the Lord's  Prayer. But before we explain this advantage and necessity of the  Creed, it is sufficient at first for the simple-minded that they learn  to comprehend and understand the Creed itself.    In the first place, the Creed has hitherto been divided into twelve  articles, although, if all points which are written in the Scriptures  and which belong to the Creed were to be distinctly set forth, there  would be far more articles, nor could they all be clearly expressed in  so few words. But that it may be most easily and clearly understood as  it is to be taught to children, we shall briefly sum up the entire  Creed in three chief articles, according to the three persons in the  Godhead, to whom everything that we believe is related, So that the  First Article, of God the Father, explains Creation, the Second  Article, of the Son, Redemption, and the Third, of the Holy Ghost,  Sanctification. Just as though the Creed were briefly comprehended in  so many words: I believe in God the Father, who has created me; I  believe in God the Son, who has redeemed me; I believe in the Holy  Ghost, who sanctifies me. One God and one faith, but three persons,  therefore also three articles or confessions. Let us briefly run over  the words.    Article I.    I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.    This portrays and sets forth most briefly what is the essence, will,  activity, and work of God the Father. For since the Ten Commandments  have taught that we are to have not more than one God, the question  might be asked, What kind of a person is God? What does He do? How can  we praise or portray and describe Him, that He may be known? Now, that  is taught in this and in the following article, so that the Creed is  nothing else than the answer and confession of Christians arranged with  respect to the First Commandment. As if you were to ask a little child:  My dear, what sort of a God have you? What do you know of Him? he could  say: This is my God: first, the Father, who has created heaven and  earth; besides this only One I regard nothing else as God; for there is  no one else who could create heaven and earth.    But for the learned, and those who are somewhat advanced [have  acquired some Scriptural knowledge], these three articles may all be  expanded and divided into as many parts as there are words. But now for  young scholars let it suffice to indicate the most necessary points,  namely, as we have said, that this article refers to the Creation: that  we emphasize the words: Creator of heaven and earth But what is the  force of this, or what do you mean by these words: I believe in God the  Father Almighty, Maker, etc.? Answer: This is what I mean and believe,  that I am a creature of God; that is, that He has given and constantly  preserves to me my body, soul, and life, members great and small, all  my senses, reason, and understanding, and so on, food and drink,  clothing and support, wife and children, domestics, house and home,  etc. Besides, He causes all creatures to serve for the uses and  necessities of life -- sun, moon and stars in the firmament, day and  night, air, fire, water, earth, and whatever it bears and produces,  birds and fishes, beasts, grain, and all kinds of produce, and whatever  else there is of bodily and temporal goods, good government, peace,  security. Thus we learn from this article that none of us has of  himself, nor can preserve, his life nor anything that is here  enumerated or can be enumerated, however small and unimportant a thing  it might be, for all is comprehended in the word Creator.    Moreover, we also confess that God the Father has not only given us all  that we have and see before our eyes, but daily preserves and defends  us against all evil and misfortune, averts all sorts of danger and  calamity; and that He does all this out of pure love and goodness,  without our merit, as a benevolent Father, who cares for us that no  evil befall us. But to speak more of this belongs in the other two  parts of this article, where we say: Father Almighty  Now, since: all that we possess, and, moreover, whatever, in addition,  is in heaven and upon the earth, is daily given, preserved, and kept  for us by God, it is readily inferred and concluded that it is our duty  to love, praise, and thank Him for it without ceasing, and, in short,  to serve Him with all these things as He demands and has enjoined in  the Ten Commandments.    Here we could say much if we were to expatiate, how few there are that  believe this article. For we all pass over it, hear it and say it, but  neither see nor consider what the words teach us. For if we believed it  with the heart, we would also act accordingly, and not stalk about  proudly, act defiantly, and boast as though we had life, riches, power,  and honor, etc., of ourselves, so that others must fear and serve us,  as is the practice of the wretched, perverse world, which is drowned in  blindness, and abuses all the good things and gifts of God only for its  own pride, avarice, lust, and luxury, and never once regards God, so  as to thank Him or acknowledge Him as Lord and Creator.    Therefore, this article ought to humble and terrify us all, if we  believed it. For we sin daily with eyes, ears, hands, body and soul,  money and possessions, and with everything we have, especially those  who even fight against the Word of God. Yet Christians have this  advantage, that they acknowledge themselves in duty bound to serve God  for all these things, and to be obedient to Him [which the world knows  not how to do].    We ought, therefore, daily to practice this article, impress it upon  our mind, and to remember it in all that meets our eyes, and in all  good that falls to our lot, and wherever we escape from calamity or  danger, that it is God who gives and does all these things, that  therein we sense and see His paternal heart and His transcendent love  toward us. Thereby the heart would be warmed and kindled to be  thankful, and to employ all such good things to the honor and praise of  God.    Thus we have most briefly presented the meaning of this article, as  much as is at first necessary for the most simple to learn, both as to  what we have and receive from God, and what we owe in return, which is  a most excellent knowledge, but a far greater treasure. For here we see  how the Father has given Himself to us, together with all creatures,  and has most richly provided for us in this life, besides that He has  overwhelmed us with unspeakable, eternal treasures by His Son and the  Holy Ghost, as we shall hear.    Article II.    And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the  Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was  crucified, dead, and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He  rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the  right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to  judge the quick and the dead.    Here we learn to know the Second Person of the Godhead, so that we see  what we have from God over and above the temporal goods  aforementioned; namely, how He has completely poured forth Himself and  withheld nothing from us that He has not given us. Now, this article is  very rich and broad; but in order to expound it also briefly and in a  childlike way, we shall take up one word and sum up in that the entire  article, namely (as we have said), that we may here learn how we have  been redeemed; and we shall base this on these words: In Jesus Christ,  our Lord.    If now you are asked, What do you believe in the Second Article of  Jesus Christ? answer briefly: I believe that Jesus Christ, true Son of  God, has become my Lord. But what is it to become Lord? It is this,  that He has redeemed me from sin, from the devil, from death, and all  evil. For before I had no Lord nor King, but was captive under the  power of the devil, condemned to death, enmeshed in sin and blindness.    For when we had been created by God the Father, and had received from  Him all manner of good, the devil came and led us into disobedience,  sin, death, and all evil, so that we fell under His wrath and  displeasure and were doomed to eternal damnation, as we had merited and  deserved. There was no counsel, help, or comfort until this only and  eternal Son of God in His unfathomable goodness had compassion upon our  misery and wretchedness, and came from heaven to help us. Those tyrants  and jailers, then, are all expelled now, and in their place has come  Jesus Christ, Lord of life, "]]]
