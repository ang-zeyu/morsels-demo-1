[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15043"],[0,"The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, Vol. 01 (of 12) (#16)"],[1," term taste, like all other figurative terms, is not extremely  accurate; the thing which we understand by it is far from a simple and  determinate idea in the minds of most men, and it is therefore liable to  uncertainty and confusion. I have no great opinion of a definition, the  celebrated remedy for the cure of this disorder. For, when we define, we  seem in danger of circumscribing nature within the bounds of our own  notions, which we often take up by hazard or embrace on trust, or form  out of a limited and partial consideration of the object before us;  instead of extending our ideas to take in all that nature comprehends,  according to her manner of combining. We are limited in our inquiry by  the strict laws to which we have submitted at our setting out.            Circa vilem patulumque morabimur orbem,      Unde pudor proferre pedem vetat aut operis lex.      A definition may be very exact, and yet go but a very little way towards  informing us of the nature of the thing defined; but let the virtue of a  definition be what it will, in the order of things, it seems rather to  follow than to precede our inquiry, of which it ought to be considered  as the result. It must be acknowledged that the methods of disquisition  and teaching may be sometimes different, and on very good reason  undoubtedly; but, for my part, I am convinced that the method of  teaching which approaches most nearly to the method of investigation is  incomparably the best; since, not content with serving up a few barren  and lifeless truths, it leads to the stock on which they grew; it tends  to set the reader himself in the track of invention, and to direct him  into those paths in which the author has made his own discoveries, if he  should be so happy as to have made any that are valuable.    But to cut off all pretence for cavilling, I mean by the word taste, no  more than that faculty or those faculties of the mind, which are  affected with, or which form a judgment of, the works of imagination and  the elegant arts. This is, I think, the most general idea of that word,  and what is the least connected with any particular theory. And my point  in this inquiry is, to find whether there are any principles, on which  the imagination is affected, so common to all, so grounded and certain,  as to supply the means of reasoning satisfactorily about them. And such  principles of taste I fancy there are; however paradoxical it may seem  to those, who on a superficial view imagine that there is so great a  diversity of tastes, both in kind and degree, that nothing can be more  indeterminate.    All the natural powers in man, which I know, that are conversant about  external objects, are the senses; the imagination; and the judgment. And  first with regard to the senses. We do and we must suppose, that as the  conformation of their organs are nearly or altogether the same in all  men, so the manner of perceiving external objects is in all men the  same, or with little difference. We are satisfied that what appears to  be light to one eye, appears light to another; that what seems sweet to  one palate, is sweet to another; that what is dark and bitter to this  man, is likewise dark and bitter to that; and we conclude in the same  manner of great and little, hard and soft, hot and cold, rough and  smooth; and indeed of all the natural qualities and affections of  bodies. If we suffer ourselves to imagine, that their senses present to  different men different images of things, this sceptical proceeding will  make every sort of reasoning on every subject vain and frivolous, even  that sceptical reasoning itself which had persuaded us to entertain a  doubt concerning the agreement of our perceptions. But as there will be  little doubt that bodies present similar images to the whole species, it  must necessarily be allowed, that the pleasures and the pains which  every object excites in one man, it must raise in all mankind, whilst  it operates naturally, simply, and by its proper powers only: for if we  deny this, we must imagine that the same cause, operating in the same  manner, and on subjects of the same kind, will produce different  effects; which would be highly absurd. Let us first consider this point  in the sense of taste, and the rather as the faculty in question has  taken its name from that sense. All men are agreed to call vinegar sour,  honey sweet, and aloes bitter; and as they are all agreed in finding  those qualities in those objects, they do not in the least differ  concerning their effects with regard to pleasure and pain. They all  concur in calling sweetness pleasant, and sourness and bitterness  unpleasant. Here there is no diversity in their sentiments; and that  there is not, appears fully from the consent of all men in the metaphors  which are taken, from the souse of taste. A sour temper, bitter  expressions, bitter curses, a bitter fate, are terms well and strongly  understood by all. And we are altogether as well understood when we say,  a sweet disposition, a sweet person, a sweet condition and the like. It  is confessed, that custom and some other causes have made many  deviations from the natural pleasures or pains which belong to these  several tastes; but then the power of distinguishing between the natural  and the acquired relish remains to the very last. A man frequently comes  to prefer the taste of tobacco to that of sugar, and the flavor of  vinegar to that of milk; but this makes no confusion in tastes, whilst  he is sensible that the tobacco and vinegar are not sweet, and whilst he  knows that habit alone has reconciled his palate to these alien  pleasures. Even with such a person we may speak, and with sufficient  precision, concerning tastes. But should any man be found who declares,  that to him tobacco has a taste like sugar, and that he cannot  distinguish between milk and vinegar; or that tobacco and vinegar are  sweet, milk bitter, and sugar sour; we immediately conclude that the  organs of this man are out of order, and that his palate is utterly  vitiated. We are as far from conferring with such a person upon tastes,  as from reasoning concerning the relations of quantity with one who  should deny that all the parts together were equal to the whole. We do  not call a man of this kind wrong in his notions, but absolutely mad.  Exceptions of this sort, in either way, do not at all impeach our  general rule, nor make us conclude that men have various principles  concerning the relations of quantity or the taste of things. So that  when it is said, taste cannot be disputed, it can only mean, that no one  can strictly answer what pleasure or pain some particular man may find  from the taste of some particular thing. This indeed cannot be disputed;  but we may dispute, and with sufficient clearness too, concerning the  things which are naturally pleasing or disagreeable to the sense. But  when we talk of any peculiar or acquired relish, then we must know the  habits, the prejudices, or the distempers of this particular man, and we  must draw our conclusion from those.    This agreement of mankind is not confined to the taste solely. The  principle of pleasure derived from sight is the same in all. Light is  more pleasing than darkness. Summer, when the earth is clad in green,  when the heavens are serene and bright, is more agreeable than winter,  when everything makes a different appearance. I never remember that  anything beautiful, whether a man, a beast, a bird, or a plant, was  ever shown, though it were to a hundred people, that they did not all  immediately agree that it was beautiful, though some might have thought  that it fell short of their expectation, or that other things were still  finer. I believe no man thinks a goose to be more beautiful than a swan,  or imagines that what they call a Friesland hen excels a peacock. It  must be observed too, that the pleasures of the sight are not near so  complicated, and confused, and altered by unnatural habits and  associations, as the pleasures of the taste are; because the pleasures  of the sight more commonly acquiesce in themselves; and are not so often  altered by considerations which are independent of the sight itself. But  things do not spontaneously present themselves to the palate as they do  to the sight; they are generally applied to it, either as food or as  medicine; and from the qualities which they possess for nutritive or  medicinal purposes they often form the palate by degrees, and by force  of these associations. Thus opium is pleasing to Turks, on account of  the agreeable delirium it produces. Tobacco is the delight of Dutchmen,  as it diffuses a torpor and pleasing stupefaction. Fermented spirits  please our common people, because they banish care, and all  consideration of future or present evils. All of these would lie  absolutely neglected if their properties had originally gone no further  than the taste; but all these, together with tea and coffee, and some  other things, have passed from the apothecary's shop to our tables, and  were taken for health long before they were thought of for pleasure. The  effect of the drug has made us use it frequently; and frequent use,  combined with the agreeable effect, has made the taste itself at last  agreeable. But this does not in the least perplex our reasoning;  because we distinguish to the last the acquired from the natural relish.  In describing the taste of an unknown fruit, you would scarcely say that  it had a sweet and pleasant flavor like tobacco, opium, or garlic,  although you spoke to those who were in the constant use of those drugs,  and had great pleasure in them. There is in all men a sufficient  remembrance of the original natural causes of pleasure, to enable them  to bring all things offered to their senses to that standard, and to  regulate their feelings and opinions by it. Suppose one who had so  vitiated his palate as to take more pleasure in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15100"],[0,"The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay (#16)"],[1," a proper supply of black  cattle be sent.    Fish are caught in great plenty, and in the proper season very fine  turtle. The woods are inhabited by innumerable tribes of birds, many of  them very gay in plumage. The most useful are pigeons, which are very  numerous, and a bird not unlike the Guinea fowl, except in colour, (being  chiefly white,) both of which were at first so tame as to suffer  themselves to be taken by hand. Of plants that afford vegetables for the  table, the chief are cabbage palm, the wild plantain, the fern tree, a  kind of wild spinage, and a tree which produces a diminutive fruit,  bearing some resemblance to a currant. This, it is hoped, by  transplanting and care, will be much improved in size and flavour.    But the productions which give the greatest importance to Norfolk Island  are the pines and the flax plant, the former rising to a size and  perfection unknown in other places, and promising the most valuable  supply of masts and spars for our navy in the East Indies; the latter not  less estimable for the purposes of making sail-cloth, cordage, and even  the finest manufactures; growing in great plenty, and with such  luxuriance as to attain the height of eight feet.* The pines measure  frequently one hundred and sixty, or even one hundred and eighty feet in  height, and are sometimes nine or ten feet in diameter at the bottom of  the trunk. They rise to about eighty feet without a branch; the wood is  said to be of the best quality, almost as light as that of the best  Norway masts; and the turpentine obtained from it is remarkable for  purity and whiteness. The fern tree is found also of a great height for  its species, measuring from seventy to eighty feet, and affords excellent  food for the sheep and other small cattle. A plant producing pepper, and  supposed to be the true oriental pepper, has been discovered lately in  the island, growing in great plenty; and specimens have been sent to  England, in order to ascertain this important point.    [* The flax plant is thus described in Captain Cook's first voyage, vol.  iii. p. 39. as found at New Zealand. \"There is, however, a plant that  serves the inhabitants instead of hemp and flax, which excels all that  are put to the same purposes in other countries. Of this plant there are  two sorts; the leaves of both resemble those of flags, but the flowers  are smaller and their clusters more numerous; in one kind they are  yellow, and in the other a deep red. Of the leaves of these plants, with  very little preparation, they make all their common apparel; and of these  they also make their strings, lines, and cordage for every purpose, which  are so much stronger than any thing we can make with hemp, that they will  not bear a comparison. From the same plant, by another preparation, they  draw long slender fibres which shine like silk, and are as white as snow:  of these, which are also surprizingly strong, the finer clothes are made;  and of the leaves, without any other preparation than splitting them into  proper breadths and trying the strips together, they make their fishing  nets; some of which, as I have before remarked, are of an enormous size.\"  It is added, that it is found in every kind of soil. It is perennial, and  has a bulbous root. Some of the roots have lately been sent to England.]    The chief disadvantage experienced by those who are sent to Norfolk  Island, is the want of a good landing place. The bay which has been used  for this purpose is inclosed by a reef of coral rock, through which there  is a passage only for a boat; and during the tide of flood, when the wind  is westerly, the landing is rather dangerous. In one of the debarkations  a midshipman, who was ordered to lie within the reef, that he might  attend the boats coming to shore, imprudently suffered his own boat to  drive into the surf, and was lost, with four men. He had been once before  overset in consequence of a similar inattention, and then had lost one  man. On the coast of the island are several small bays, and there are  still hopes that a better landing place may be discovered; but the  necessity of employing all the men in sheltering themselves and the  stores from the weather, or in clearing ground for various purposes, has  hitherto prevented Mr. King from sending out any persons to complete the  examination. Should this enquiry prove unsuccessful, it is proposed to  attempt the blowing up of one or two small rocks, by which the reef is  rendered dangerous. If this expedient also should fail, the evil must be  borne with patience. In summer the landing will generally be sufficiently  secure; and seamen, who have seen the bay of Riga, in the Baltic,  declare, that it will at all times be safer for a ship to load with masts  and spars at Norfolk Island, than in that place, where so many ships are  freighted yearly.    Rats are the only quadrupeds which have been found in this island; and  from these, as well as from the ants, it was feared the crops might  suffer; but no great inconvenience has yet been experienced from them;  and proper exertions seldom fail in a short time to reduce the number of  such enemies, enough to make their depredations very inconsiderable. On  the whole, Norfolk Island certainly deserves to be considered as an  acquisition of some importance, and is likely to answer even the most  sanguine expectations. Some canoes have been found on the rocks, which  were supposed to have been driven from New Zealand; but the appearance of  a fresh cocoa nut and a small piece of manufactured wood, which seemed to  have been only a small time in the water, has lately suggested an idea  that probably some inhabited island may lie at no great distance. There  has not been as yet any opportunity to determine whether this opinion be  well founded or not.    A small island, but entirely uninhabited, was discovered by Lieutenant  Ball in his passage to Norfolk Island. In his return he examined it, and  found that the shore abounded with turtle, but there was no good  anchorage. He named it Lord Howe Island. It is in 31 deg. 36' south latitude,  and 159 deg. east longitude. Part of this island being very high may be seen  at the distance of sixteen leagues, and a rock to the south-east of it,  may be discerned even at eighteen leagues. In latitude 29 deg. 25' south,  longitude 159 deg. 59' east, a very dangerous reef has since been seen. The  ship from which it was observed was then four leagues to the southward,  and it could not at that time be ascertained how far it extends to the  northward.    To expedite the cultivation of Norfolk Island a fresh detachment was sent  thither in October, consisting of an officer and eight marines, with  thirty convicts, consisting of ten women and twenty men: Thus, there  existed on this islet, when the last accounts were transmitted,  forty-four men and sixteen women, who, having eighteen months provisions,  lived comfortably on this sequestered spot, under the prudent management  of a youthful ruler, of whose busy life the reader may wish to know all  the particulars, which at present can be authentically told.    Philip Gidley King, who had the honour to conduct the original settlers  to Norfolk Island, was born at Launceston in Cornwall, on the 23d of  April, 1758. He is the son of Philip King, of that town, draper, who  married the daughter of John Gidley, of Exeter, attorney at law. Much as  he owes to his parents, he is indebted for his scholastic learning to Mr.  Bailey at Yarmouth. He derives, probably, some advantages from making an  early choice of his profession. At the age of twelve, he went to the East  Indies on board the Swallow frigate, Captain Shirley, by whom he was  rated a midshipman. From this station he returned to England, at the end  of five years, with much knowledge of his business, and some acquaintance  with the world. In 1775, he entered upon real service; and has continued  in active employment from that period to this great epoch of his life. He  went to Virginia with Captain Bellew, in the Liverpool, during the year  1775; with whom he continued till the shipwreck of that frigate in  Delaware Bay. And having entered on board the Princess Royal, in October  1778, he was made a Lieutenant by Admiral Byron, in the Renown, on the  26th of November following. He returned to England in the subsequent  year; and served in the Channel on board the Kite cutter, and Ariadne  frigate, till the beginning of 1783. With Captain Phillip he went to the  East Indies, as Lieutenant of the Europe, in January 1783; from whence he  returned on the restoration of complete peace, in May 1784. In this  service it was, that Phillip and King became acquainted with the merit of  each other. And when the expedition to New South Wales was projected,  King was appointed Lieutenant of the Sirius, on the 25th of October,  1786, at the same time that Phillip was nominated Commander of the  voyage.      Chapter XI.    March 1788 to May 1788    Three of the transports cleared--Two excursions made into the country, on  the fifteenth of April, and on the twenty-second--Huts of the  natives--Sculpture, and other particulars.    25 March 1788    On the 25th of March, the Charlotte, Lady Penrhyn, and Scarborough  transports, having been cleared of all their stores, were discharged from  government service, and left at liberty to proceed for China, whenever  their commanders should think proper. The other ships were of necessity  detained till the store-houses could be finished.    15 April 1788    The month of April was not distinguished by any events that deserve to be  related, except two expeditions of Governor Phillip for the purpose of  exploring the country. On the first of these excursions he set out on the  15th with provisions for four days; attended by several officers, and a  small party of marines. They landed at the head of a small cove, called  Shell Cove, near the entrance of the"]]]
