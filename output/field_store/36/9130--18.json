But oh, papa dear, dear papa!\" she cried, putting her arm about his  neck and bursting into hysterical weeping, \"promise me, if you love me  promise me, that you will not leave the house till I have told you. I am  sick, I am suffering; you will stay by me? you will not leave me?\"    \"My darling, I will do anything I can to relieve you, mentally or  physically,\" he answered in tones of tenderest love and concern. \"I shall  not stir from the house, while to do so would increase your suffering. I  perceive there has been some villainy practised upon you, and a promise  extorted, which I shall not ask you to break; but rest assured, I shall  keep guard over my precious one.\"    \"And Mr. Travilla!\" she gasped. \"Oh, papa, if I only knew he was safe!\"    \"Perhaps the note may set your mind at rest on that point. Shall I read it  for you?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" she said, putting it into his hand with a slight blush, \"he  never writes what I should be ashamed or afraid to have my father see.\"    It was but short, written merely to explain his absence, and dated from a  neighboring plantation, where he had gone to assist in nursing a sick  friend whom he should not be able to leave for some days. There were words  of deep, strong affection, but as she had foreseen, nothing that she need  care to have her father know or see.    \"Does not this news allay your fears for him?\" Mr. Dinsmore asked  tenderly.    \"Yes, papa,\" she answered, the tears streaming from her eyes. \"Oh, how  good God is to me! I will trust Him, trust Him for you both, as well as  myself.\" She covered her face with her hands while shudder after shudder  shook her whole frame.    Mr. Dinsmore was much perplexed, and deeply concerned. \"Shall I send for  Dr. Barton?\" he asked.    \"No, no, papa! I am not ill; only my nerves have had a great, a terrible  shock; they seem all unstrung, and my temples are throbbing with pain.\"    \"My poor, poor darling! strange that with all my care and watchfulness you  should have been subjected to such a trial. Some ruffian has been trying  to extort money from you, I presume, by threatened violence to yourself,  Travilla, and me. Where were you?\"    \"In my arbor, sir.\"    \"And alone?\"    \"Yes, papa; I thought myself safe there.\"    \"I forbid you to go there or to any distance from the house, alone, again.  You must always have some one within call, if not close at your side.\"    \"And my father knows I will obey him,\" she said, tremulously lifting his  hand to her lips.    He administered an anodyne to relieve the tortured nerves, then sitting  down beside her, passed his hand soothingly over hair and cheek, while  with the other he held one of hers in loving, tender clasp. Neither spoke,  and at length she fell asleep; yet not a sound, refreshing slumber, but  disturbed by starts and moans, and frequent wakings to see and feel that  he was still there. \"Papa, don't go away; don't leave me!\" was her  constant cry.    \"My darling, my precious one, I will not,\" was his repeated assurance; \"I  will stay with you while this trouble lasts.\"    And all that day and night he never left her side, while Rose came and  went, full of anxiety and doing everything that could be done for the  sufferer's relief.    It was a night of unrest to them all; but morning found her free from  pain, though weak and languid, and still filled with distress if her  father was absent for more than a few moments from her side. She inquired  of him at what hour she had come in the day before: then watched the time  and, as soon as released from her promise, told them all.    Great was his indignation; and, determined that, if possible, the villain  should be apprehended and brought to justice, he sent word at once to the  magistrates: a warrant was issued, and several parties were presently out  in different directions in hot pursuit.    But with the twenty-four hours' start Jackson had made good his escape,  and the only advantage gained was the relief of knowing that he no longer  infested the neighborhood.    \"But when may he not return?\" Elsie said with a shudder. \"Papa, I tremble  for you, and for--Mr. Travilla.\"    \"I am far more concerned for you,\" he answered, gazing upon her pale face  with pitying, fatherly tenderness. \"But let us cast this care, with all  others, upon our God. 'Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is  stayed on Thee; because he trusteth in Thee.'\"          CHAPTER ELEVENTH.        \"Of truth, he truly will all styles deserve       Of wise, good, just; a man both soul and nerve.\"                                            --SHIRLEY.      The story reached Mr. Travilla's ears that evening, and finding he could  be spared from the sick-room, he hastened to the Oaks. His emotions were  too big for utterance as he took his \"little friend\" in his arms and  clasped her to his beating heart.    \"God be thanked that you are safe!\" he said at last. \"Oh, my darling, my  darling, what peril you have been in and how bravely you met it! You are  the heroine of the hour,\" he added with a faint laugh, \"all, old and  young, male and female, black and white, are loud in praise of your  wonderful firmness and courage. And, my darling, I fully agree with them,  and exult in the thought that this brave lady is mine own.\"    He drew her closer as he spoke, and just touched his lips to the shining  hair and the pure white forehead resting on his breast.    \"Ah!\" she murmured low and softly, a dewy light shining in her eyes, \"why  should they think it anything wonderful or strange that I felt little  dread or fear at the prospect of a sudden transit from earth to heaven--a  quick summons home to my Father's house on high, to be at once freed from  sin and forever with the Lord? I have a great deal to live for, life  looks very bright and sweet to me; yet but for you and papa, I think it  would have mattered little to me had he carried out his threat.\"    \"My little friend, it would have broken my heart: to lose you were worse  than a thousand deaths.\"    They were alone in Elsie's boudoir, but when an hour had slipped rapidly  away there came a message from Mr. Dinsmore to the effect that their  company would be very acceptable in the library.    They repaired thither at once, and found him and Rose laying out plans for  a summer trip. The matter was under discussion all the rest of the evening  and for some days after, resulting finally in the getting up a large party  of tourists, consisting of the entire families of the Oaks and Ion, with  the addition of Harry and Sophie Carrington, and Lora with her husband and  children; servants of course included.    They kept together for some time, visiting different points of interest in  Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York; spending several weeks at Cape May;  where they were joined by the Allisons of Philadelphia; Mr. Edward and  Adelaide among the rest, they having returned from Europe shortly before.    At length they separated, some going in one direction, some in another.  Lora went to Louise, Rose to her father's, Mrs. and Mr. Travilla to  friends in Cincinnati and its suburbs, and Elsie to pay a long-promised  visit to Lucy in her married home, a beautiful country-seat on the banks  of the Hudson. Her father saw her safely there, then left her for a  fortnight; their fears in regard to Jackson having been allayed by the  news that he had been again arrested for burglary, and Lucy and her  husband promising to guard their precious charge with jealous care.    At the end of the fortnight Mr. Dinsmore returned for his daughter, and  they went on together to Lansdale to visit Miss Stanhope.    Elsie had set her heart on having her dear old aunt spend the fall and  winter with them in the \"sunny South,\" and especially on her being present  at the wedding; and Miss Stanhope, after much urging and many  protestations that she was too old for such a journey, had at last  yielded, and given her promise, on condition that her nephew and niece  should come for her, and first spend a week or two in Lansdale. She  entreated that Mr. Travilla and his mother might be of the party. \"He was  a great favorite of hers, and she was sure his mother must be a woman in a  thousand.\"    They accepted the kindness as cordially as it was proffered; met the  others at the nearest point of connection, and all arrived together.    It was not Lottie King who met them at the depot this time, but a  fine-looking young man with black moustache and roguish dark eye, who  introduced himself as Harry Duncan, Miss Stanhope's nephew.    \"Almost a cousin! Shall we consider you quite one?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore,  warmly shaking the hand held out to him in cordial greeting.    \"Thank you, I shall feel highly honored,\" the young man answered in a  gratified tone, and with a glance of undisguised admiration and a  respectful bow directed towards Elsie. Then turning with an almost  reverential air and deeper bow to Mrs. Travilla, \"And, madam, may I have  the privilege of placing you alongside of my dear old aunt, and addressing  you by the same title?\"    \"You may, indeed,\" was the smiling rejoinder. \"And my son here, I suppose,  will take his place with the others as cousin. No doubt we are all  related, if we could only go back far enough in tracing out our  genealogies.\"    \"To Father Adam, for instance,\" remarked Mr. Travilla, laughingly.    \"Or good old Noah, or even his son Japheth,\" rejoined Harry, leading the  way to a family carriage sufficiently roomy to hold them all comfortably.    \"Your checks, if you please, aunt and cousins; and Simon here will attend  to your luggage. Servants' also.\"    Elsie turned her head to see a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#16)"],[1,"place, 'God so loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in  him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' 'God commendeth his  love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.' He  must have loved you, Molly, when he died that dreadful death to save you.\"    \"Not me.\"    \"Yes, if you will believe. 'Whosoever believeth.'\"    \"It was just for everybody in a lump,\" said Molly, sighing wearily. \"Not  for you or me, or anybody in particular; at least not anybody that's  living now; because we weren't made then; so how could he?\"    \"But mamma says he knew he was going to make us, just the same as he does  now; and that he thought of each one, and loved and died for each one just  as much as if there was only one.\"    \"Well, it's queer if he loved me so well as that, and yet would let me  fall and be so awfully injured. What's this? You didn't have it before you  came North,\" taking hold of the gold chain about Elsie's neck.    Out came the little watch and Elsie told about the aching tooth and the  trip to New York to have it extracted.    \"Seems to me,\" was Molly's comment, \"you have all the good things: such a  nice mother and everything else. Such a good father too, and mine was  killed when I was a little bit of a thing; and mother's so cross.    \"But Dick's good to me; dear old Dick,\" she added, looking up at him with  glistening eyes as he came in and going up to her couch, asked how she  was.    \"You'd better go to sleep now,\" he said. \"You've been talking quite  awhile, haven't you?\"    At that Elsie slipped quietly away and went in search of her mother.    She found her alone on the veranda looking out meditatively upon the  restless moonlit waters of the sea.    \"Mamma,\" said the child softly, \"I should like a stroll on the beach with  you. Can we go alone? I want to talk with you about something.\"    \"Come then, daughter,\" and hand in hand they sought the beach, only a few  yards distant.    It was a clear still night, the moon nearly at the full, and the cool salt  breeze from the silver-tipped waves was exceedingly refreshing after the  heat of the day; which had been one of the hottest of the season.    For a while they paced to and fro in silence; then little Elsie gave her  mother the substance of her conversation with Molly in which the latter  expressed her disbelief in God's love for her because he had not prevented  her fall. \"Mamma,\" she said in conclusion, \"how I wished you were there to  make her understand.\"    \"Poor child!\" said the mother, in low, moved tones, \"only he who permitted  this sore trial can convince her that it was sent in love.\"    \"But you will talk to her, mamma?\"    \"Yes, when a suitable opportunity offers; but prayer can do more for her  than any words of ours, addressed to her.\"    The presence of Molly and her mother proved a serious drawback to the  enjoyment of our party during the remainder of their sojourn at the  seashore. The burden fell heaviest upon Elsie and her children, as the  principal entertainers, and the mother had often to counsel patience and  forbearance, and to remind her darlings of their promise to be ready to do  all they could for the comfort and happiness of the sufferer.    All made praiseworthy efforts to fulfil their engagement, and Elsie and  Vi, particularly the former, as nearest to Molly in age, and therefore  most desired by her as a companion, gave up many a pleasure excursion for  her sake, staying at home to talk with and amuse her when all the rest  were out driving or boating.          CHAPTER FOURTEENTH.          \"Ah! who can say, however fair his view,       Through what sad scenes his path may lie?\"      Mrs. Conly adhered to her resolve in regard to the education of her  daughters, and about the middle of September left with them and her  younger children for a visit to Mrs. Delaford, at whose house the  wardrobes of the two girls were to be made ready for their first school  year at the convent chosen by their aunt.    Arthur went with them as their escort. A week later the rest of the  Roselands party returned home, and early in October the Oaks and Ion  rejoiced in the return of their families.    Baby Lily had been so benefited by the trip that Elsie felt warranted in  resuming her loved employment as acting governess to her older children.    They fell into the old round of duties and pleasures, as loving and happy  a family as one might wish to see; a striking and most pleasant contrast  to the one at Roselands, that of Enna and her offspring--where the mother  fretted and scolded, and the children, following her example were  continually at war with one another.    Only between Dick and Molly there was peace and love. The poor girl led a  weary life pinned to her couch or chair, wholly dependent upon others for  the means of locomotion and for anything that was not within reach of her  hand.    She had not yet learned submission under her trial, and her mother was far  from being an assistance in bearing it. Molly was greatly depressed in  spirits, and her mother's scolding and fretting were often almost beyond  endurance.    Her younger brother and sister thought it a trouble to wait on her and  usually kept out of her way, but Dick, when present, was her faithful  slave; always ready to lift and carry her, or to bring her anything she  wanted. But much of Dick's time was necessarily occupied with his studies,  and in going to and from his school, which was two or three miles distant.    He was very thoughtful for her comfort, and it was through his suggestion,  that their grandfather directed that one of the pleasantest rooms in the  house, overlooking the avenue, so that all the coming and going could be  seen from its windows, should be appropriated to Molly's use.    There Dick would seat her each morning, before starting for school, in an  invalid's easy-chair presented to her by her Cousin Elsie, and there he  would be pretty sure to find her on his return, unless, as occasionally  happened, their grandfather, Uncle Horace, Mr. Travilla, or some one of  the relatives, had taken her out for a drive.    One afternoon about the last of November, Molly, weary of sewing and  reading, weary inexpressibly weary, of her confinement and enforced  quietude, was gazing longingly down the avenue, wishing that some one  would come to take her out for an airing, when the door opened and her  mother came in dressed for the open air, in hat, cloak and furs.    \"I want you to button my glove, Molly,\" she said, holding out her wrist,  \"Rachel's so busy on my new silk, and you have nothing to do. What a  fortunate child you are to be able to take your ease all the time.\"    \"My ease!\" cried Molly bitterly, \"I'd be gladder than words can tell to  change places with you for awhile.\"    \"Humph! you don't know what you're wishing; the way I have to worry over  my sewing for four besides myself, is enough to try the patience of a  saint. By the way, it's high time you began to make yourself useful in  that line. With practice, you might soon learn to accomplish a great deal,  having nothing to do but stick at it from morning to night.\"    Molly was in the act of buttoning the second glove. Tears sprang to her  eyes at this evidence of her mother's heartlessness, and one bright drop  fell on Enna's wrist.    \"There you have stained my glove!\" she exclaimed angrily. \"What a baby you  are! will you never have done with this continued crying?\"    \"It seems to be very easy for you to bear my troubles, mother,\" returned  poor Molly, raising her head proudly, and dashing away the tears, \"I will  try to learn to bear them too, and never again appeal to my mother for  sympathy.\"    \"You get enough of that from Dick, he cares ten times as much for you as  he does for me--his own mother.\"    At that moment Betty came running in. \"Mother, the carriage is at the  door, and grandpa's ready. Molly, grandpa says he'll take you too, if you  want to go.\"    Molly's face brightened, but before she could speak, Enna answered for  her. \"No, she can't; there isn't time to get her ready.\"    Mrs. Johnson hurried from the room, Betty following close at her heels,  and Molly was left alone in her grief and weariness.    She watched the carriage as it rolled down the avenue, then turning from  the window, indulged in a hearty cry.    At length, exhausted by her emotion, she laid her head back and fell  asleep in her chair.    How long she had slept she did not know; some unusual noise down-stairs  woke her, and the next moment Betty rushed in screaming, \"Oh, Molly,  Molly, mother and grandfather's killed; both of 'em! Oh, dear! oh, dear!\"    For an instant Molly seemed stunned, she scarcely comprehended Betty's  words, then as the child repeated, \"They're killed! they're both killed;  the horses ran away and threw 'em out,\" she too uttered a cry of anguish,  and grasping the arms of her chair, made desperate efforts to rise; but  all in vain, and with a groan she sank back, and covering her face with  her hands, shed the bitterest tears her impotence had ever yet cost her.    Betty had run away again, and she was all alone. Oh, how hard it was for  her to be chained there in such an agony of doubt and distress! She  forcibly restrained her groans and sobs, and listened intently.    The Conlys, except Cal, were still at the North; the house seemed  strangely quiet, only now and then a stealthy step or a murmur of voices  and occasionally a half smothered cry from Bob or Betty.    A horseman came dashing furiously up the avenue. It was her uncle, Mr.  Horace Dinsmore. He threw himself from the saddle and hurried into the  house, and the next minute two more followed at the same headlong pace.    These were Cal and Dr. Barton, and they also dismounted in hot haste and  disappeared from her sight beneath the veranda. Certainly something very  dreadful had happened. Oh would nobody come to tell her!  "]]]
