I have not       much to add, but I think we have heard from Sir Frederick Young a       view of South African affairs on the political side which, I may       tell you frankly, differs diametrically from my own. I have heard       from Mr. Merriman a view of affairs in which I cordially concur,       but from neither have I heard of that third aspect which, I think,       is necessary to complete the view. Sir Frederick Young has told us       that for twenty-five years, certainly during the last ten years,       South Africa has been mismanaged. I must confess I was sorry to       hear the strong language he used, because one cannot but remember       that for the greater part of the last twenty years most of the       affairs of South Africa have been in the hands of free       self-governing communities. Cape Colony has been under Responsible       Government since 1873, and the Free State and the Transvaal have       always been self-governing. I agree with Mr. Merriman that for the       last twenty-five years affairs in South Africa have progressed,       with one signal and fatal exception, and that was the policy under       which we took over and then gave back the Transvaal. Omitting that,       I think we have but little to be sorry for in the history of South       Africa. There have been troubles, but I, for one, think that all       difficulties, would have been avoided if the phrase \"Imperial aid\"       had been substituted for that of \"Imperial interference\" in the       affairs of South Africa. It is the aid which has been given by the       Mother Country which has resulted in developing the material       resources, and, above all, in establishing the security from native       attack of various European States in South Africa. Sir Frederick       Young spoke of the attitude towards the Imperial Government. I       could wish he had been in Cape Town on the day Sir Charles Warren       landed, and seen the ovation he received from all classes. Let me       add this--that the Bechuanaland expedition, which was led by Sir       Charles Warren, and in which I had the good fortune to take part,       cost the Mother Country perhaps L1,500,000, but in the discussions       in Parliament or in the press as to the future of Bechuanaland, the       fact is seldom mentioned that Bechuanaland was acquired for the       Empire at the cost of the British taxpayer. Let me remind you of       another fact, which the Cape Colonist well knows--that when the       Imperial Government wished, from wise motives of economy, to extend       the Cape system of railways to Kimberley, at a time when the Cape       Ministers were not prepared to carry out the extension, the British       Parliament advanced a loan of L400,000, at a low rate of interest,       for that object. Another instance I could quote, in connection with       the history of that interesting native territory--Basutoland. You       remember how that country was handed over to the Cape Colonists,       and that for various reasons the management of the Basutos got       beyond their power, the result being that the Imperial Government       went to the aid of the Cape Colony and took back Basutoland. I       mention these cases because they illustrate an aspect of affairs       which is, I think, apt to be neglected. We at home--and certainly       those who have enjoyed the kind hospitality of their brethren in       South Africa--wish to do all we can to aid our fellow-countrymen in       that part of the globe. We do not wish to interfere, and I should       like to see this put forward as the grand and final policy of South       Africa--that we are ready to aid that portion of the Empire, but       set our faces against interference. In conclusion, I will add that       I am sure all of us congratulate Sir Frederick Young on having so       successfully accomplished his arduous journey, returning to us, as       he does, in better health than when he left. If you wish to renew       your youth, and grow younger instead of older, follow his       example--make a trip through South Africa, sleeping in the open       veldt.         Dr. SYMES THOMPSON: Another year's experience has confirmed and       strengthened my conclusions as to the remarkable salubrity of the       South African climate in cases of chest disease and of nerve wear,       which I laid before the Royal Colonial Institute in November last.       While regarding the neighbourhood of Cape Town and Grahamstown as       beneficial for a short sojourn, among the upland stations I would       call attention to Middelburg and Tarkestad. Hotel accommodation and       adequate comfort for invalids, as regards food, quarters,       attention, occupation, and amusement, are still most deficient.       During the recent drought the dust storms proved very trying to the       eyes and to the bronchial membranes at Kimberley, and at       Johannesburg the dangers were great. I rejoice to learn that Sir       Frederick Young has found his winter trip so health-giving, and       believe that a similar expedition might prove of immense value to       many Englishmen who are overwrought in body or in mind.         The CHAIRMAN (the Right Hon. the Marquis of Lorne, K.T., G.C.M.G.):       I propose a hearty vote of thanks to Sir Frederick Young for his       kindness in reading the Paper. I was extremely interested myself,       as I think you all were. In his political observations, and in       speaking of a firm policy, I think that, after all, what the reader       of the Paper meant was firmness in allowing each nationality to       develop itself as it best might, with aid from home. I think that       is the sense of his observations, and I am sure we are obliged to       him, not only for speaking of more personal matters, but also for       telling us the actual impressions he derived from the journey. I       entirely agree with Mr. Merriman--and I believe Sir Frederick Young       does--that, finding ourselves in South Africa with the Dutch, we       must work with them and through them. I hope the Dutch will allow       themselves to be helped in one matter which Sir Frederick Young       impressed on President Kruger--apparently not with great       results--viz., in the matter of railways, and that they will allow       railways to pierce the Transvaal. I am sure he is a man of too much       intelligence very much to object to railways. That policy would be       too much like that of the Chinese. I remember, when I was at the       head of a society in London, asking the representative of China to       come and listen to a paper in regard to railways through Siam. He       said solemnly--\"Chinese not like railways.\" I said this railway       would not go through the Imperial dominions--that it would only be       at a respectful distance. Again my remarks were interpreted to him,       and again, after a long pause, he solemnly replied--\"Chinese don't       like railways near frontier.\" I am sure President Kruger will not       fritter chances away in that manner, and that he will allow us to       help him.         SIR FREDERICK YOUNG, K.C.M.G.: I feel extremely flattered by the       compliment which our noble Chairman has been good enough to pay me.       It was really most gratifying to me to be able to take the       interesting and instructive tour from which I have recently       returned, and the only difficulty and hesitation I felt as to       giving an account of what I saw was that I saw so much that I did       not know how I could crowd a tithe of it in the reasonable       dimensions of a paper. I was a little in dread, I confess, when so       astute and able a politician as Mr. Merriman rose to make his       criticisms; but I wish him to understand, as well as you, that the       view I put forward--perhaps I did not explain myself as clearly as       I ought to have done--was that advocated by Mr. Merriman himself,       namely, that South Africa should be allowed to frame her own       policy. That is the sum and substance of what I wished to say on       that point. As the noble Marquis has been so kind as to act as my       interpreter, I need not take up more of your time by enlarging on       this question. I have now the greatest possible pleasure in asking       you to join with me in thanking the noble Marquis for having, as       one of our Vice-Presidents, been so kind as to preside on this       occasion.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    APPENDIX II.    IMPERIAL FEDERATION.           An address on the above interesting subject was delivered by Sir       Frederick Young, K.C.M.G., in the Y.M.C. Association Hall, on       Monday, when the room was filled to its utmost capacity. The chair       was taken by the President of the Association, Mr. E.J. Earp, who,       in introducing the lecturer to the audience, said he was a       gentleman who was well and favourably known to many colonists, who       had received great attention and kindness from him during their       visits to the Old Country. Sir Frederick Young had very kindly       responded to the invitation of the committee to lecture this       evening, and though the subject of Imperial Federation was of a       somewhat political nature, still it was not of such a character as       to preclude its being spoken about within the walls of the       association. The subject of the lecture was one worthy of all       attention, which had recently been occupying the attention of       eminent statesmen of various political opinions. This was an age of       specialists, and he thought that Sir Frederick Young might be well       considered as a specialist on the subject upon which he was now       about to address them. He had for many years"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],[0,"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#16)"],[1," but calm.  Scarcely a billow.  Captain Nemo, whom I hoped to meet, would he be  there?  I saw no one but the steersman imprisoned in his glass cage.  Seated upon the projection formed by the hull of the pinnace, I inhaled  the salt breeze with delight.    By degrees the fog disappeared under the action of the sun's rays, the  radiant orb rose from behind the eastern horizon.  The sea flamed under  its glance like a train of gunpowder.  The clouds scattered in the  heights were coloured with lively tints of beautiful shades, and  numerous \"mare's tails,\" which betokened wind for that day.  But what  was wind to this Nautilus, which tempests could not frighten!    I was admiring this joyous rising of the sun, so gay, and so  life-giving, when I heard steps approaching the platform.  I was  prepared to salute Captain Nemo, but it was his second (whom I had  already seen on the Captain's first visit) who appeared.  He advanced  on the platform, not seeming to see me.  With his powerful glass to his  eye, he scanned every point of the horizon with great attention.  This  examination over, he approached the panel and pronounced a sentence in  exactly these terms.  I have remembered it, for every morning it was  repeated under exactly the same conditions.  It was thus worded:    \"Nautron respoc lorni virch.\"    What it meant I could not say.    These words pronounced, the second descended.  I thought that the  Nautilus was about to return to its submarine navigation.  I regained  the panel and returned to my chamber.    Five days sped thus, without any change in our situation.  Every  morning I mounted the platform.  The same phrase was pronounced by the  same individual.  But Captain Nemo did not appear.    I had made up my mind that I should never see him again, when, on the  16th November, on returning to my room with Ned and Conseil, I found  upon my table a note addressed to me.  I opened it impatiently.  It was  written in a bold, clear hand, the characters rather pointed, recalling  the German type.  The note was worded as follows:      TO PROFESSOR ARONNAX, On board the Nautilus.  16th of November, 1867.    Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax to a hunting-party, which will  take place to-morrow morning in the forests of the Island of Crespo.  He hopes that nothing will prevent the Professor from being present,  and he will with pleasure see him joined by his companions.    CAPTAIN NEMO, Commander of the Nautilus.      \"A hunt!\" exclaimed Ned.    \"And in the forests of the Island of Crespo!\" added Conseil.    \"Oh! then the gentleman is going on terra firma?\" replied Ned Land.    \"That seems to me to be clearly indicated,\" said I, reading the letter  once more.    \"Well, we must accept,\" said the Canadian.  \"But once more on dry  ground, we shall know what to do.  Indeed, I shall not be sorry to eat  a piece of fresh venison.\"    Without seeking to reconcile what was contradictory between Captain  Nemo's manifest aversion to islands and continents, and his invitation  to hunt in a forest, I contented myself with replying:    \"Let us first see where the Island of Crespo is.\"    I consulted the planisphere, and in 32 deg. 40' N. lat. and 157 deg.  50' W. long., I found a small island, recognised in 1801 by Captain  Crespo, and marked in the ancient Spanish maps as Rocca de la Plata,  the meaning of which is The Silver Rock.  We were then about eighteen  hundred miles from our starting-point, and the course of the Nautilus,  a little changed, was bringing it back towards the southeast.    I showed this little rock, lost in the midst of the North Pacific, to  my companions.    \"If Captain Nemo does sometimes go on dry ground,\" said I, \"he at least  chooses desert islands.\"    Ned Land shrugged his shoulders without speaking, and Conseil and he  left me.    After supper, which was served by the steward, mute and impassive, I  went to bed, not without some anxiety.    The next morning, the 17th of November, on awakening, I felt that the  Nautilus was perfectly still.  I dressed quickly and entered the saloon.    Captain Nemo was there, waiting for me.  He rose, bowed, and asked me  if it was convenient for me to accompany him.  As he made no allusion  to his absence during the last eight days, I did not mention it, and  simply answered that my companions and myself were ready to follow him.    We entered the dining-room, where breakfast was served.    \"M. Aronnax,\" said the Captain, \"pray, share my breakfast without  ceremony; we will chat as we eat.  For, though I promised you a walk in  the forest, I did not undertake to find hotels there.  So breakfast as  a man who will most likely not have his dinner till very late.\"    I did honour to the repast.  It was composed of several kinds of fish,  and slices of sea-cucumber, and different sorts of seaweed.  Our drink  consisted of pure water, to which the Captain added some drops of a  fermented liquor, extracted by the Kamschatcha method from a seaweed  known under the name of Rhodomenia palmata.  Captain Nemo ate at first  without saying a word.  Then he began:    \"Sir, when I proposed to you to hunt in my submarine forest of Crespo,  you evidently thought me mad.  Sir, you should never judge lightly of  any man.\"    \"But Captain, believe me----\"    \"Be kind enough to listen, and you will then see whether you have any  cause to accuse me of folly and contradiction.\"    \"I listen.\"    \"You know as well as I do, Professor, that man can live under water,  providing he carries with him a sufficient supply of breathable air.  In submarine works, the workman, clad in an impervious dress, with his  head in a metal helmet, receives air from above by means of forcing  pumps and regulators.\"    \"That is a diving apparatus,\" said I.    \"Just so, but under these conditions the man is not at liberty; he is  attached to the pump which sends him air through an india-rubber tube,  and if we were obliged to be thus held to the Nautilus, we could not go  far.\"    \"And the means of getting free?\"  I asked.    \"It is to use the Rouquayrol apparatus, invented by two of your own  countrymen, which I have brought to perfection for my own use, and  which will allow you to risk yourself under these new physiological  conditions without any organ whatever suffering.  It consists of a  reservoir of thick iron plates, in which I store the air under a  pressure of fifty atmospheres.  This reservoir is fixed on the back by  means of braces, like a soldier's knapsack.  Its upper part forms a box  in which the air is kept by means of a bellows, and therefore cannot  escape unless at its normal tension.  In the Rouquayrol apparatus such  as we use, two india rubber pipes leave this box and join a sort of  tent which holds the nose and mouth; one is to introduce fresh air, the  other to let out the foul, and the tongue closes one or the other  according to the wants of the respirator.  But I, in encountering great  pressures at the bottom of the sea, was obliged to shut my head, like  that of a diver in a ball of copper; and it is to this ball of copper  that the two pipes, the inspirator and the expirator, open.\"    \"Perfectly, Captain Nemo; but the air that you carry with you must soon  be used; when it only contains fifteen per cent.  of oxygen it is no  longer fit to breathe.\"    \"Right!  But I told you, M. Aronnax, that the pumps of the Nautilus  allow me to store the air under considerable pressure, and on those  conditions the reservoir of the apparatus can furnish breathable air  for nine or ten hours.\"    \"I have no further objections to make,\" I answered.  \"I will only ask  you one thing, Captain--how can you light your road at the bottom of  the sea?\"    \"With the Ruhmkorff apparatus, M. Aronnax; one is carried on the back,  the other is fastened to the waist.  It is composed of a Bunsen pile,  which I do not work with bichromate of potash, but with sodium.  A wire  is introduced which collects the electricity produced, and directs it  towards a particularly made lantern.  In this lantern is a spiral glass  which contains a small quantity of carbonic gas.  When the apparatus is  at work this gas becomes luminous, giving out a white and continuous  light.  Thus provided, I can breathe and I can see.\"    \"Captain Nemo, to all my objections you make such crushing answers that  I dare no longer doubt.  But, if I am forced to admit the Rouquayrol  and Ruhmkorff apparatus, I must be allowed some reservations with  regard to the gun I am to carry.\"    \"But it is not a gun for powder,\" answered the Captain.    \"Then it is an air-gun.\"    \"Doubtless!  How would you have me manufacture gun powder on board,  without either saltpetre, sulphur, or charcoal?\"    \"Besides,\" I added, \"to fire under water in a medium eight hundred and  fifty-five times denser than the air, we must conquer very considerable  resistance.\"    \"That would be no difficulty.  There exist guns, according to Fulton,  perfected in England by Philip Coles and Burley, in France by Furcy,  and in Italy by Landi, which are furnished with a peculiar system of  closing, which can fire under these conditions.  But I repeat, having  no powder, I use air under great pressure, which the pumps of the  Nautilus furnish abundantly.\"    \"But this air must be rapidly used?\"    \"Well, have I not my Rouquayrol reservoir, which can furnish it at  need?  A tap is all that is required.  Besides M. Aronnax, you must see  yourself that, during our submarine hunt, we can spend but little air  and but few balls.\"    \"But it seems to me that in this twilight, and in the midst of this  fluid, which is very dense compared with the atmosphere, shots could  not go far, nor easily prove mortal.\"    \"Sir, on the contrary, with this gun every blow is mortal; and, however  lightly the animal is touched, it falls as if struck by a thunderbolt.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because the balls sent by this gun are not ordinary balls, but little  cases of glass.
