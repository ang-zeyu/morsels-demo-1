You have done very well, Mrs. Bater, with the San Francisco  storekeepers.'    \"'Good God, man, what are you?' she gasped. 'You seem to read into the  innermost recesses of my soul, and to know everything.'    \"'You are right, madam,' I said, trying to appear very stern and  almost failing, she was so pretty. By Jove! you fellows, I wonder I  didn't kiss her; she had such fine eyes, my favourite nose, a ripping  mouth and--\"    \"Oh! go on! go on with your story. Never mind her looks,\" Curtis  interrupted, \"I've got a touch of indigestion.\"    \"As I was saying,\" Kelson went on complacently, \"I could have kissed  her and I felt downright mean for upsetting her so.    \"'Now you have found me out,' she said, 'what do you intend doing?  Show me up in there?' and she pointed shudderingly at the store.    \"'No,' I said, 'not if you are sensible and come to terms. I will  agreeto say nothing about either this or any of your other--ahem!--  thefts--if you let me escort you home, and write me out a cheque for  a thousand dollars!'    \"'Beast!' she hissed, 'so you are a blackmailer!'    \"'A black beetle if you like,' I responded, 'but I assure you, Mrs.  Bater, I am letting you off cheap. I have only to call for a policeman  and your reputation would be gone at once. Besides, I know other  things about you.'    \"'What other things?' she stuttered.    \"'Well, madam!' I replied, 'some things are rather delicate--er--for  single men like me to mention, but I do know that--er--a lady--very  like--remarkably like--you, has in her pocket at this moment a rattle  which she bought and paid for in Oakland's late last night. And as,  madam, Mr. Bater has been dead over two years--let me see--yes, two  years yesterday--one can--!'    \"'Stay! that will do,' she whispered; 'come to my house and I will  give you the thousand dollars. You must pretend you are my cousin.'    \"'I will pretend anything, Mrs. Bater,' I murmured, helping her into a  taxi, 'anything so long as I can be with you.'\"    \"You got the money?\" Hamar queried.    \"Yes,\" Kelson said with a smile, \"I got the money--in fact, everything  I asked for.\"    There was silence for some minutes, and then Hamar said, \"What next?\"    \"What next!\" Kelson said, \"why I thought I had done a very good day's  work and was on my way back here to take a much needed rest, when I'm  dashed if the Unknown hadn't another adventure in store for me. Coming  out of a garden in Gough Street, within sight of Goad's house, was a  lady, young and very plain, but rigged out in one of those latest  fashion costumes--a very tight, short skirt, and huge hat with high  plume in it. By the bye, I can't think why this costume, which is so  admirably suited to pretty girls--because it attracts attention to  them--should be almost exclusively adopted by the ugly ones. But to  continue. I knew immediately that she was Ella Barlow, the  much-pampered and only daughter of J.B. Barlow, the vinegar magnate;  that she was in love, or imagined herself in love with Herbert Delmas,  the manager of the Columbian Bank--a young, good-looking fellow, whom  she had been trying to set against his fiancee, Dora Roberts. Dora is  only nineteen, very pretty and a trifle giddy--nothing more. But this  failing of hers--if you can call it a failing, was just the very  weapon Ella Barlow wanted. She worked on it at once, and by sending  Delmas a series of anonymous letters made him mad with jealousy. This  resulted in a breach between Delmas and Dora, and Ella Barlow, much  elated, at once tried to step into her shoes. She has been going out a  good deal with Delmas, who is in reality still very much in love with  Dora, and consequently exceedingly miserable. This morning Ella,  anxious to show off a magnificent set of diamonds, given her by her  father, telephoned to Delmas to take her to the Baldwyn Theatre, where  she has engaged a box for this evening--fondly hoping that the  diamonds will bring him up to the scratch, and that he will propose to  her. When I saw her she was on her way to a notorious quack doctor and  beauty specialist in Californian Street. She suffers from some nasty  skin disease, and is in mortal terror lest Delmas should get to know  of it, and also of the fact that all her teeth are false, and that two  of her toes are badly deformed.\"    \"By Jupiter!\" Hamar ejaculated, \"this divination of yours beats mine  into fits--nothing escapes you!\"    \"No!\" Kelson laughed, \"nothing! Ella Barlow, metaphysical and physical  was laid before me just as bare as if the Almighty had got hold of her  with his dissecting knife. I saw everything--and what is more I said  to myself--here's plenty I can turn to a profitable account. Well! I  didn't stop her--I let her go.\"    \"Let her go!\" Curtis growled, his mouth full of almonds and raisins.  \"You squirrel!\"    \"Only for a time,\" Kelson said, \"I went to see Delmas!\"    \"Delmas!\" Hamar interlocuted, \"why the deuce Delmas?\"    \"Impulse!\" Kelson explained, \"purely impulse.\"    \"Yes, but impulse is often a dangerous thing!\" Hamar said, \"it is  essential for us three, especially, to be on our guard against  impulse. What did you get out of Delmas?\"    \"Nothing!\" Kelson said looking rather shamefaced, \"But the matter  hasn't ended yet. I'm going to the theatre after I've had something to  eat. I'll tell you what happens, to-morrow.\"    It was late ere Kelson came down to breakfast the following day, and  Hamar and Curtis were comfortably seated in armchairs reading the  _Examiner_, when he joined them.    \"Well!\" Hamar said, looking up at him, \"what luck?\"    But Kelson wouldn't say a word till he had finished eating. He then  lolled back in his seat and began:--    \"Arriving at the Baldwyn I went straight to box one. A tall figure  rose to greet me, and then, an angry voice exclaimed, 'Why it's not  Herbert! Who are you, sir? Do you know this box is engaged?'    \"'I humbly beg your pardon, Miss Barlow,' I said, 'I do know it is  engaged, but I came as Mr. Delmas' deputy and friend.'    \"'Came as Herbert's deputy and friend,' Ella Barlow repeated--and by  Jove the diamonds did shine--she was simply a mass of them, hair,  neck, arms and fingers--and she had been so well faked up for the  occasion that she was almost good-looking; but I thought of all I knew  about her--and shuddered.    \"'I will explain myself,' I said, 'Mr. Delmas telephoned to you this  afternoon, did he not?'    \"She nodded.    \"'Saying that he very much regretted he could not leave business in  time to escort you here. Would you mind very much going by yourself,  and he would join you as soon as possible.'    \"'Yes,' Ella Barlow said, 'he told me all that.'    \"'Very well, then,' I went on, 'he rang me up some minutes later and  asked me if I would take his place for the first hour or so, and he  would be here by the end of the first act.'    \"'But it is most unheard of,' Ella Barlow ejaculated, 'I don't know  you--I've never seen you before!'    \"'That is, of course, very regrettable,' I said, 'but I will do all I  can for the past. I've something to say that I'm sure will interest  you. Have I your permission?'--and without waiting for her reply I sat  next to her. The box was a big one, big enough to hold half a dozen  people, and we sat in the extreme front of it. The lights were not  full up, as the orchestra had not started playing. I kept her  attention fixed on my face so that she was unaware what was taking  place, immediately behind her.    \"'What is it?' she said, 'whatever can you have to say that can be of  any possible interest to me?'    \"'Why,' I replied, 'to begin with I know something about your  character!'    \"'Then you're a fortune teller!' she exclaimed eagerly, 'can you read  hands?'    \"'I can read everything,' I said looking hard at her, 'hands, head,  and feet. I am psychometrist, dentist, physician, metaphysician all in  one!'    \"'I don't understand,' she said looking queer, 'what is the meaning of  all this?'    \"'It means,' I said slowly, 'that I have discovered who sent those  anonymous letters to Herbert Delmas!'    \"'Anonymous letters! how dare you!' she cried, 'what have anonymous  letters to do with me?'    \"'A very great deal, madam,' I replied, 'shall I remind you of their  contents and the occasions on which you wrote them?' I did so. I  recited every word in them and told her the hour, day and  place--namely, when and where each was written, and I summed up by  asking what she would pay me not to tell Delmas.    \"For some minutes she was too overcome to say anything; she sat grim  and silent, her pale eyes glaring at me, her freckled fingers toying  with the diamonds. She was baffled and perplexed--she did not know  what course to pursue!    \"'Well,' I repeated, 'what have you to say? Do you deny it?'    \"She roused herself with an effort. 'No,' she said venomously, 'I  don't deny it. Denial would be useless. How did you find out? Through  one of the maids, I suppose. They were bribed to spy on me!'    \"'How I discovered it is of no consequence,' I said, 'but what is of  consequence to you as much as to me--is the payment for hushing it  up!'    \"'Payment!' she cried, raising her voice to a positive shriek in her  excitement, 'pay _you_--you nasty,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14328"],[0,"The Consolation of Philosophy (#16)"],[1," this thou didst go on  to add, as by the way, the proof that no one would be happy unless he  were likewise God. Again, thou didst say that the very form of good was  the essence both of God and of happiness, and didst teach that the  absolute One was the absolute good which was sought by universal nature.  Thou didst maintain, also, that God rules the universe by the governance  of goodness, that all things obey Him willingly, and that evil has no  existence in nature. And all this thou didst unfold without the help of  assumptions from without, but by inherent and proper proofs, drawing  credence one from the other.'    Then answered she: 'Far is it from me to mock thee; nay, by the blessing  of God, whom we lately addressed in prayer, we have achieved the most  important of all objects. For such is the form of the Divine essence,  that neither can it pass into things external, nor take up anything  external into itself; but, as Parmenides says of it,        '\"In body like to a sphere on all sides perfectly rounded,\"    it rolls the restless orb of the universe, keeping itself motionless the  while. And if I have also employed reasonings not drawn from without,  but lying within the compass of our subject, there is no cause for thee  to marvel, since thou hast learnt on Plato's authority that words ought  to be akin to the matter of which they treat.'        SONG XII.    ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE.          Blest he whose feet have stood      Beside the fount of good;      Blest he whose will could break      Earth's chains for wisdom's sake!        The Thracian bard, 'tis said,      Mourned his dear consort dead;      To hear the plaintive strain      The woods moved in his train,      And the stream ceased to flow,      Held by so soft a woe;      The deer without dismay      Beside the lion lay;      The hound, by song subdued,      No more the hare pursued,      But the pang unassuaged      In his own bosom raged.      The music that could calm      All else brought him no balm.      Chiding the powers immortal,      He came unto Hell's portal;      There breathed all tender things      Upon his sounding strings,      Each rhapsody high-wrought      His goddess-mother taught--      All he from grief could borrow      And love redoubling sorrow,      Till, as the echoes waken,      All Taenarus is shaken;      Whilst he to ruth persuades      The monarch of the shades      With dulcet prayer. Spell-bound,      The triple-headed hound      At sounds so strangely sweet      Falls crouching at his feet.      The dread Avengers, too,      That guilty minds pursue      With ever-haunting fears,      Are all dissolved in tears.      Ixion, on his wheel,      A respite brief doth feel;      For, lo! the wheel stands still.      And, while those sad notes thrill,      Thirst-maddened Tantalus      Listens, oblivious      Of the stream's mockery      And his long agony.      The vulture, too, doth spare      Some little while to tear      At Tityus' rent side,      Sated and pacified.        At length the shadowy king,      His sorrows pitying,      'He hath prevailed!' cried;      'We give him back his bride!      To him she shall belong,      As guerdon of his song.      One sole condition yet      Upon the boon is set:      Let him not turn his eyes      To view his hard-won prize,      Till they securely pass      The gates of Hell.' Alas!      What law can lovers move?      A higher law is love!      For Orpheus--woe is me!--      On his Eurydice--      Day's threshold all but won--      Looked, lost, and was undone!        Ye who the light pursue,      This story is for you,      Who seek to find a way      Unto the clearer day.      If on the darkness past      One backward look ye cast,      Your weak and wandering eyes      Have lost the matchless prize.          BOOK IV.    GOOD AND ILL FORTUNE.           SUMMARY.         CH. I. The mystery of the seeming moral confusion. Philosophy       engages to make this plain, and to fulfil her former promise to the       full.--CH. II. Accordingly, (a) she first expounds the paradox that       the good alone have power, the bad are altogether powerless.--CH.       III. (b) The righteous never lack their reward, nor the wicked       their punishment.--CH. IV. (c) The wicked are more unhappy when       they accomplish their desires than when they fail to attain them.       (d) Evil-doers are more fortunate when they expiate their crimes by       suffering punishment than when they escape unpunished. (e) The       wrong-doer is more wretched than he who suffers injury.--CH. V.       Boethius still cannot understand why the distribution of happiness       and misery to the righteous and the wicked seems the result of       chance. Philosophy replies that this only seems so because we do       not understand the principles of God's moral governance.--CH. VI.       The distinction of Fate and Providence. The apparent moral       confusion is due to our ignorance of the secret counsels of God's       providence. If we possessed the key, we should see how all things       are guided to good.--CH. VII. Thus all fortune is good fortune; for       it either rewards, disciplines, amends, or punishes, and so is       either useful or just.          BOOK IV.        I.      Softly and sweetly Philosophy sang these verses to the end without  losing aught of the dignity of her expression or the seriousness of her  tones; then, forasmuch as I was as yet unable to forget my deeply-seated  sorrow, just as she was about to say something further, I broke in and  cried: 'O thou guide into the way of true light, all that thy voice hath  uttered from the beginning even unto now has manifestly seemed to me at  once divine contemplated in itself, and by the force of thy arguments  placed beyond the possibility of overthrow. Moreover, these truths have  not been altogether unfamiliar to me heretofore, though because of  indignation at my wrongs they have for a time been forgotten. But, lo!  herein is the very chiefest cause of my grief--that, while there exists  a good ruler of the universe, it is possible that evil should be at all,  still more that it should go unpunished. Surely thou must see how  deservedly this of itself provokes astonishment. But a yet greater  marvel follows: While wickedness reigns and flourishes, virtue not only  lacks its reward, but is even thrust down and trampled under the feet of  the wicked, and suffers punishment in the place of crime. That this  should happen under the rule of a God who knows all things and can do  all things, but wills only the good, cannot be sufficiently wondered at  nor sufficiently lamented.'    Then said she: 'It would indeed be infinitely astounding, and of all  monstrous things most horrible, if, as thou esteemest, in the  well-ordered home of so great a householder, the base vessels should be  held in honour, the precious left to neglect. But it is not so. For if  we hold unshaken those conclusions which we lately reached, thou shall  learn that, by the will of Him of whose realm we are speaking, the good  are always strong, the bad always weak and impotent; that vices never go  unpunished, nor virtues unrewarded; that good fortune ever befalls the  good, and ill fortune the bad, and much more of the sort, which shall  hush thy murmurings, and stablish thee in the strong assurance of  conviction. And since by my late instructions thou hast seen the form of  happiness, hast learnt, too, the seat where it is to be found, all due  preliminaries being discharged, I will now show thee the road which will  lead thee home. Wings, also, will I fasten to thy mind wherewith thou  mayst soar aloft, that so, all disturbing doubts removed, thou mayst  return safe to thy country, under my guidance, in the path I will show  thee, and by the means which I furnish.'        SONG I.    THE SOUL'S FLIGHT.          Wings are mine; above the pole        Far aloft I soar.      Clothed with these, my nimble soul        Scorns earth's hated shore,      Cleaves the skies upon the wind,      Sees the clouds left far behind.        Soon the glowing point she nears,        Where the heavens rotate,      Follows through the starry spheres        Phoebus' course, or straight      Takes for comrade 'mid the stars      Saturn cold or glittering Mars;        Thus each circling orb explores        Through Night's stole that peers;      Then, when all are numbered, soars        Far beyond the spheres,      Mounting heaven's supremest height      To the very Fount of light.        There the Sovereign of the world        His calm sway maintains;      As the globe is onward whirled        Guides the chariot reins,      And in splendour glittering      Reigns the universal King.        Hither if thy wandering feet        Find at last a way,      Here thy long-lost home thou'lt greet:        'Dear lost land,' thou'lt say,      'Though from thee I've wandered wide,      Hence I came, here will abide.'        Yet if ever thou art fain        Visitant to be      Of earth's gloomy night again,        Surely thou wilt see      Tyrants whom the nations fear      Dwell in hapless exile here.        II.      Then said I: 'Verily, wondrous great are thy promises; yet I do not  doubt but thou canst make them good: only keep me not in suspense after  raising such hopes.'    'Learn, then, first,' said she, 'how that power ever waits upon the  good, while the bad are left wholly destitute of strength.[K] Of these  truths the one proves the other; for since good and evil are contraries,  if it is made plain that good is power, the feebleness of evil is  clearly seen, and, conversely, if the frail nature of evil is made  manifest, the strength of good is thereby known. However, to win ampler  credence for my conclusion, I will pursue both paths, and draw  confirmation for my statements first in one way and then in the other.
