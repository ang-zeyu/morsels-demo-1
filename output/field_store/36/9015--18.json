He let the cook feed him a chunk o' meat the other  day; and you remember he don't usually touch stuff that other men have  handled.\"    \"Yep,\" grunted Buck, \"it's sure disgustin' to have a dog as tame as  that. I'd bet he ain't killed another dog for a whole day, maybe!\"    And still Barry saw no irony in this.    He answered, as gravely as before: \"No, it was the day before yesterday.  Somebody come to town and got drunk. He had two dogs, and sicked 'em on  Bart.\"    Buck Daniels controlled an incipient shudder.    \"Both dead?\"    \"I was inside the house,\" said Dan sadly, \"and it took me a couple of  seconds to get outside. Of course by that time Bart had cut their  throats.\"    \"Of course. Didn't the drunk guy try to pot Bart?\"    \"Yes, he got out his gun; but, Mr. O'Brien, the bartender, persuaded him  out of it. I was glad there wasn't no trouble.\"    \"My God!\" exclaimed Buck Daniels. And then: \"Well, let's go inside.  We'll take your man-eater along, if you want to.\"    A shadow came in the eyes of Barry.    \"Can't we talk jest as well out here?\"    \"What's the matter with findin' some chairs?\"    \"Because I don't like to get inside walls. You know how four walls seem  like so many pairs of eyes standin' around you?\"    \"No,\" said Buck bluntly, \"I don't know nothin' of the kind. What d'you  mean?\"    \"I dunno,\" answered Barry, depressed. \"It jest seems that way. Ain't you  noticed how sort of close it is in a house? Hard to breathe? Like you had  on a shirt too small for you.\"    \"We'll stay out here, then.\"    The other nodded, smiled, and made a gesture to the dog behind him.  Black Bart crouched on the ground, and Dan Barry sat down cross-legged,  his shoulders leaning against the shaggy pelt of Bart. Daniels followed  the example with less grace. He was thinking very hard and fast, and he  rolled a Durham cigarette to fill the interlude.    \"I s'pose you're bustin' to find out the news about the folks,\" he said  dryly, at last.    The other sat with his hands loosely clasped in his lap. His wide eyes  looked far away, and there was about his lips that looseness, that lack  of compression, which one sees so often in children. He might have sat,  in that posture, for the statue of thoughtlessness.    \"What folks?\" he asked at last    Buck Daniels had lighted a match, but now he sat staring blank until the  match burned down to his fingers. With an oath he tossed the remnant  away and lighted another. He had drawn down several long breaths of  smoke to the bottom of his lungs before he could speak again.    \"Some people you used to know; I suppose you've forgotten all about 'em,  eh?\" His eyes narrowed; there was a spark of something akin to dread in  them. \"Kate Cumberland?\" he queried.    A light came in the face of Dan Barry.    \"Kate Cumberland?\" he repeated. \"How is she, Buck? Lately, I been  thinkin' about her every day.\"    A trembling took the body and the voice of Daniels; his errand, after  all, might meet some success.    \"Kate?\" he repeated. \"Oh, ay, she's well enough. But Joe Cumberland  ain't.\"    \"No?\"    \"He's dyin' Dan.\"    And Dan replied calmly. \"He's kind of old, I s'pose.\"    \"Old?\" said Buck, with a sort of horror. \"Yes, he's old, right enough.  D'you know why he's dying? It's because you went away the way you done,  Dan. That's what's killin' him.\"    Something of thought came in the face of Barry.    \"Maybe I understand,\" he said slowly. \"If I was to lose Satan, or  Bart--\" here the great dog whined at the mention of his name, and Barry  dropped a slender hand across the scarred forehead of his servant. \"If I  was to lose 'em, I'd sort of mourn for 'em, maybe.\"    Buck Daniels set his teeth.    \"I don't suppose it seems possible,\" he said, \"that a man could miss  another man the way you could miss your--dog, eh? But it is! Joe  Cumberland is dying for you, Dan, as sure as if you'd put a bullet in  his bowels.\"    The other hesitated and then frowned and made a gesture of vague  dismissal.    \"Don't you figure on doin' nothing about it?\" asked Buck softly.    \"What could I do?\"    \"My God A'mighty, ain't you got no human feelin's?\"    \"I dunno what you mean,\" said the soft voice.    \"This! Can't you git on your hoss and ride back with me to Cumberland  Ranch? Stay with the old man till he gets back on his feet. Ain't that  easy to do? Is your time so damned valuable you can't spare a few days  for that?\"    \"But I am goin' back,\" answered Dan, in a rather hurt voice. \"They ain't  no need for cussin' me, Buck. I been thinkin' of Kate, every day,  almost.\"    \"Since when?\"    \"I dunno.\" Dan stirred uneasily. He looked up, and far above Buck,  following the direction of Dan's eyes, saw a pattern of wild geese. \"I  been sort of driftin' North towards the Cumberland Ranch and Kate,\" went  on Dan. He sighed: \"I been thinkin' of her eyes, which is blue, Buck,  and her hair, and the soft sound of her voice. They been hangin' in my  ears, stayin' behind my eyes, lately, and I been driftin' up that way  steady.\"    \"Why, man,\" cried Buck, \"then what's there to keep you here? Jump on  your hoss, and we'll head North in ten minutes.\"    \"I will!\" said Dan, full as eagerly. \"We'll start full speed.\"    \"Come on, then.\"    \"Wait a minute!\" said Dan, his voice growing suddenly cold. \"I been  forgettin' something.\"    Buck Daniels turned and found his companion strangely changed. There was  a set expression of coldness about his face, and a chill glitter in his  eyes.    \"I got to wait here for something.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"They's a man in town that may want to see me.\"    \"Mac Strann! I've heard about him. Dan, are you goin' to let Joe  Cumberland die because you want to stay here and fight it out with a  dirty cutthroat?\"    \"I don't want to fight,\" protested Barry. \"No, there ain't nothin' I  like less than fightin'!\"    Buck Daniels cursed softly and continuously to himself.    \"Dan,\" he said, \"can you sit there and lie like that to me? Ain't I seen  you in action? Don't I remember the way you trailed Jim Silent? Don't I  remember how we all got down and prayed you to keep away from Jim? Don't  I remember how you threw everything to hell so's you could get your  hands on Jim? My God A'mighty, man, didn't I see your face when you had  your fingers in Silent's throat?\"    An expression of unutterable revulsion rippled over the face of Dan  Barry.    \"Stop!\" he commanded softly, and raised his slender hand. \"Don't keep on  talkin' about it. It makes me sick--all through. Oh, Buck, they's a  tingle in the tips of my fingers still from the time I had 'em in his  throat. And it makes me feel unclean--the sort of uncleanness that won't  wash out with no kind of soap and water. Buck, I'd most rather die  myself than fight a man!\"    A vast amazement overspread the countenance of Buck Daniels as he  listened to this outburst; it was as if he had heard a healthy man  proclaim that he had no desire for bread and meat. Something rose to his  lips, but he swallowed it.    \"Then it looks kind of simple to me,\" he said. \"You hate fightin'. This  gent Mac Strann likes it; he lives on it; he don't do nothing but wait  from day to day hungerin' for a scrap. What's the out? Jest this! You  hop on your hoss and ride out with me. Young Jerry Strann kicks out--Mac  Strann starts lookin' for you--he hears that you've beat it--he goes off  and forgets about you. Ain't that simple?\"    The old uneasiness returned to the far-seeing eyes of Dan Barry.    \"I dunno,\" he said, \"maybe----\"    Then he paused again.    \"Have you got anything to say agin it?\" urged Buck, arguing desperately.    \"I dunno,\" repeated Barry, confused, \"except that I keep thinking what a  terrible disappointment it'll be to this Mac Strann when his brother  dies and I ain't around.\"    Buck Daniels stared, blinked, and then burst into unmelodious laughter.  Satan trotted across the corral and raised his head above the fence,  whinnying softly. Barry turned his head and smiled up to the horse.    Then he said: \"Seems like if Jerry Strann dies I owe somebody something.  Who? Mac Strann, I reckon. I sort of got to stay and give him his  chance.\"    \"I hope to God,\" burst out Daniels, smashing his hands together, \"that  Mac Strann beats you to a pulp! That's what I hope!\"    The eyes of Dan Barry widened.    \"Why d'you hope that?\" he asked gently.    It brought Daniels again to speechlessness.    \"Is it possible?\" he growled to himself. \"Are you a human bein' and yet  you think more of your hoss and your damned wolf-dog than you do of the  life of a man? Dan, I'm askin' you straight, is that a square thing to  do?\"    The fragile hands went out to him, palm up.    \"Don't you see, Buck? I don't want to be this way. I jest can't help  it!\"    \"Then the Lord help poor old Joe Cumberland--him that took you in out of  the desert--him that raised you from the time you was a kid--him that  nursed you like you was his own baby--him that loved you more'n he loved  Kate--him that's lyin' back there now with fire in his eyes, waitin',  waitin', waitin', for you to come back. Dan, if you was to see him you'd  go down on your knees and ask him to forgive you!\"    \"I s'pose I would,\" murmured Barry thoughtfully.    \"Dan, you're goin' to go with me!\"    \"I don't somehow think its my time for movin', Buck.\"    \"Is that all you got to say to me?\"    \"I guess maybe it is, Buck.\"    \"If I was to beg you to come for old-time's sake, and all we been  through together, you and me, wouldn't it make no difference to you?\"    The large, gentle eyes focused far beyond Buck Daniels, somewhere on a  point in the pale, hazy blue of the spring sky.    \"I'm kind of tired of talkin', Buck,\" he said at length.    And Buck Daniels rose and walked slowly away, with his head fallen.  Behind him the stallion neighed suddenly and loud, and it was so much  like a blast of defiant triumph that Buck whirled and shook his clenched  fist at Satan.          CHAPTER XIV"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12443"],[0,"The Jute Industry: From Seed to Finished Cloth (#16)"],[1,"  latter type, which is most largely used, is illustrated in Fig. 50.  It is termed a two-colour machine, and is made by Mr. D. J. Macdonald,  Dundee; it will be observed that there are two rollers for the two  distinct colours, say red and black. Occasionally three and  four-colour machines are used, but the one-colour type is probably  the most common.    [Illustration: _By Permission of Mr. D. J. Macdonald_. FIG 50 SACK  PRINTING MACHINE]    The ownership of the bags can thus be shown distinctly by one of the  many methods of colour printing, and if any firm desires to number  their bags consecutively in order to provide a record of their stock,  or for any other purpose, the bags may be so numbered by means of a  special numbering machine, also made by Mr. D. J. Macdonald.    The last operation, excluding the actual delivery of the goods, is  that of packing the pieces or bags in small compass by means of a  hydraulic press. The goods are placed on the lower moving table upon  a suitable wrapping of some kind of jute cloth; when the requisite  quantity has been placed thereon, the top and side wrappers are  placed in position, and the pumps started in order to raise the  bottom table and to squeeze the content between it and the top fixed  table. From 1 1/2 ton to 2 tons per square inch is applied  according to the nature of the goods and their destination. While  the goods are thus held securely in position between the two plates,  the wrappers a sewn together. Then specially prepared hoops or metal  bands are placed round the bale, and an ingenious and simple system,  involving a buckle and two pins, adopted for fastening the bale. The  ends of the hoop or band are bent in a small press, and these bent  ends are passed through a rectangular hole in the buckle and the  pins inserted in the loops. As soon as the hydraulic pressure is  removed, the bale expands slightly, and the buckled hoop grips the  bale securely.    Such is in brief the routine followed in the production of the fibre,  the transformation of this fibre, first into yarn, and then into  cloth, and the use of the latter in performing the function of the  world's common carrier.
