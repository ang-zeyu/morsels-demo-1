MARGARET    Therefore I'd never love, believe me!  A loss like this to death would grieve me.      MEPHISTOPHELES    Joy follows woe, woe after joy comes flying.      MARTHA    Relate his life's sad close to me!      MEPHISTOPHELES    In Padua buried, he is lying  Beside the good Saint Antony,  Within a grave well consecrated,  For cool, eternal rest created.      MARTHA    He gave you, further, no commission?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Yes, one of weight, with many sighs:  Three hundred masses buy, to save him from perdition!  My hands are empty, otherwise.      MARTHA    What! Not a pocket-piece? no jewelry?  What every journeyman within his wallet spares,  And as a token with him bears,  And rather starves or begs, than loses?      MEPHISTOPHELES    Madam, it is a grief to me;  Yet, on my word, his cash was put to proper uses.  Besides, his penitence was very sore,  And he lamented his ill fortune all the more.      MARGARET    Alack, that men are so unfortunate!  Surely for his soul's sake full many a prayer I'll proffer.      MEPHISTOPHELES    You well deserve a speedy marriage-offer:  You are so kind, compassionate.      MARGARET    O, no! As yet, it would not do.      MEPHISTOPHELES    If not a husband, then a beau for you!  It is the greatest heavenly blessing,  To have a dear thing for one's caressing.      MARGARET    The country's custom is not so.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Custom, or not! It happens, though.      MARTHA    Continue, pray!      MEPHISTOPHELES      I stood beside his bed of dying.  'Twas something better than manure,--  Half-rotten straw: and yet, he died a Christian, sure,  And found that heavier scores to his account were lying.  He cried: \"I find my conduct wholly hateful!  To leave my wife, my trade, in manner so ungrateful!  Ah, the remembrance makes me die!  Would of my wrong to her I might be shriven!\"      MARTHA (_weeping_)    The dear, good man! Long since was he forgiven.      MEPHISTOPHELES    \"Yet she, God knows! was more to blame than I.\"      MARTHA    He lied! What! On the brink of death he slandered?      MEPHISTOPHELES    In the last throes his senses wandered,  If I such things but half can judge.  He said: \"I had no time for play, for gaping freedom:  First children, and then work for bread to feed 'em,--  For bread, in the widest sense, to drudge,  And could not even eat my share in peace and quiet!\"      MARTHA    Had he all love, all faith forgotten in his riot?  My work and worry, day and night?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Not so: the memory of it touched him quite.  Said he: \"When I from Malta went away  My prayers for wife and little ones were zealous,  And such a luck from Heaven befell us,  We made a Turkish merchantman our prey,  That to the Soldan bore a mighty treasure.  Then I received, as was most fit,  Since bravery was paid in fullest measure,  My well-apportioned share of it.\"      MARTHA    Say, how? Say, where? If buried, did he own it?      MEPHISTOPHELES    Who knows, now, whither the four winds have blown it?  A fair young damsel took him in her care,  As he in Naples wandered round, unfriended;  And she much love, much faith to him did bear,  So that he felt it till his days were ended.      MARTHA    The villain! From his children thieving!  Even all the misery on him cast  Could not prevent his shameful way of living!      MEPHISTOPHELES    But see! He's dead therefrom, at last.  Were I in _your_ place, do not doubt me,  I'd mourn him decently a year,  And for another keep, meanwhile, my eyes about me.      MARTHA    Ah, God! another one so dear  As was my first, this world will hardly give me.  There never was a sweeter fool than mine,  Only he loved to roam and leave me,  And foreign wenches and foreign wine,  And the damned throw of dice, indeed.      MEPHISTOPHELES    Well, well! That might have done, however,  If he had only been as clever,  And treated _your_ slips with as little heed.  I swear, with this condition, too,  I would, myself, change rings with you.      MARTHA    The gentleman is pleased to jest.      MEPHISTOPHELES    I'll cut away, betimes, from here:  She'd take the Devil at his word, I fear.    (_To_ MARGARET)    How fares the heart within your breast?      MARGARET    What means the gentleman?      MEPHISTOPHELES (_aside_)      Sweet innocent, thou art!    (_Aloud_.)     Ladies, farewell!      MARGARET    Farewell!      MARTHA                      A moment, ere we part!  I'd like to have a legal witness,  Where, how, and when he died, to certify his fitness.  Irregular ways I've always hated;  I want his death in the weekly paper stated.      MEPHISTOPHELES    Yes, my good dame, a pair of witnesses  Always the truth establishes.  I have a friend of high condition,  Who'll also add his deposition.  I'll bring him here.      MARTHA                      Good Sir, pray do!      MEPHISTOPHELES    And this young lady will be present, too?  A gallant youth! has travelled far:  Ladies with him delighted are.      MARGARET    Before him I should blush, ashamed.      MEPHISTOPHELES    Before no king that could be named!      MARTHA    Behind the house, in my garden, then,  This eve we'll expect the gentlemen.    [Illustration]          XI      A STREET    FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES    FAUST    How is it? under way? and soon complete?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Ah, bravo! Do I find you burning?  Well, Margaret soon will still your yearning:  At Neighbor Martha's you'll this evening meet.  A fitter woman ne'er was made  To ply the pimp and gypsy trade!    FAUST    Tis well.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Yet something is required from us.    FAUST    One service pays the other thus.    MEPHISTOPHELES    We've but to make a deposition valid  That now her husband's limbs, outstretched and pallid,  At Padua rest, in consecrated soil.    FAUST    Most wise! And first, of course, we'll make the journey    thither?    MEPHISTOPHELES    _Sancta simplicitas_! no need of such a toil;  Depose, with knowledge or without it, either!    FAUST    If you've naught better, then, I'll tear your pretty plan!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Now, there you are! O holy man!  Is it the first time in your life you're driven  To bear false witness in a case?  Of God, the world and all that in it has a place,  Of Man, and all that moves the being of his race,  Have you not terms and definitions given  With brazen forehead, daring breast?  And, if you'll probe the thing profoundly,  Knew you so much--and you'll confess it roundly!--  As here of Schwerdtlein's death and place of rest?    FAUST    Thou art, and thou remain'st, a sophist, liar.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Yes, knew I not more deeply thy desire.  For wilt thou not, no lover fairer,  Poor Margaret flatter, and ensnare her,  And all thy soul's devotion swear her?    FAUST    And from my heart.    MEPHISTOPHELES      'Tis very fine!  Thine endless love, thy faith assuring,  The one almighty force enduring,--  Will that, too, prompt this heart of thine?    FAUST    Hold! hold! It will!--If such my flame,  And for the sense and power intense  I seek, and cannot find, a name;  Then range with all my senses through creation,  Craving the speech of inspiration,  And call this ardor, so supernal,  Endless, eternal and eternal,--  Is that a devilish lying game?    MEPHISTOPHELES    And yet I'm right!    FAUST      Mark this, I beg of thee!  And spare my lungs henceforth: whoever  Intends to have the right, if but his    tongue be clever,  Will have it, certainly.  But come: the further talking brings    disgust,  For thou art right, especially since I    must.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          XII      GARDEN    (MARGARET _on_ FAUST'S _arm_. MARTHA _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES  _walking up and down_.)    MARGARET    I feel, the gentleman allows for me,  Demeans himself, and shames me by it;  A traveller is so used to be  Kindly content with any diet.  I know too well that my poor gossip can  Ne'er entertain such an experienced man.    FAUST    A look from thee, a word, more entertains  Than all the lore of wisest brains.    (_He kisses her hand_.)    MARGARET    Don't incommode yourself! How could you ever kiss it!  It is so ugly, rough to see!  What work I do,--how hard and steady is it!  Mother is much too close with me.    [_They pass_.    MARTHA    And you, Sir, travel always, do you not?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Alas, that trade and duty us so harry!  With what a pang one leaves so many a spot,  And dares not even now and then to tarry!    MARTHA    In young, wild years it suits your ways,  This round and round the world in freedom sweeping;  But then come on the evil days,  And so, as bachelor, into his grave a-creeping,  None ever found a thing to praise.    MEPHISTOPHELES    I dread to see how such a fate advances.    MARTHA    Then, worthy Sir, improve betimes your chances!    [_They pass_.    MARGARET    Yes, out of sight is out of mind!  Your courtesy an easy grace is;  But you have friends in other places,  And sensibler than I, you'll find.    FAUST    Trust me, dear heart! what men call sensible  Is oft mere vanity and narrowness.    MARGARET      How so?    FAUST    Ah, that simplicity and innocence ne'er know  Themselves, their holy value, and their spell!  That meekness, lowliness, the highest graces  Which Nature portions out so lovingly--    MARGARET    So you but think a moment's space on me,  All times I'll have to think on you, all places!    FAUST    No doubt you're much alone?    MARGARET    Yes, for our household small has grown,  Yet must be cared for, you will own.  We have no maid: I do the knitting, sewing, sweeping,  The cooking, early work and late, in fact;  And mother, in her notions of housekeeping,  Is so exact!  Not that she needs so much to keep expenses down:  We, more than others, might take comfort, rather:  A nice estate was left us by my father,  A house, a little garden near the town.  But now my days have less of noise and hurry;  My brother is a soldier,  My"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/146"],[0,"A Little Princess (#16)"],[1,"was nearly DEAD.  So tonight, when I was crying under the bedclothes, I thought all at  once of creeping up here and just begging you to let us be friends  again.\"    \"You are nicer than I am,\" said Sara.  \"I was too proud to try and make  friends.  You see, now that trials have come, they have shown that I am  NOT a nice child.  I was afraid they would.  Perhaps\"--wrinkling her  forehead wisely--\"that is what they were sent for.\"    \"I don't see any good in them,\" said Ermengarde stoutly.    \"Neither do I--to speak the truth,\" admitted Sara, frankly.  \"But I  suppose there MIGHT be good in things, even if we don't see it. There  MIGHT\"--doubtfully--\"be good in Miss Minchin.\"    Ermengarde looked round the attic with a rather fearsome curiosity.    \"Sara,\" she said, \"do you think you can bear living here?\"    Sara looked round also.    \"If I pretend it's quite different, I can,\" she answered; \"or if I  pretend it is a place in a story.\"    She spoke slowly.  Her imagination was beginning to work for her. It  had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon her. She  had felt as if it had been stunned.    \"Other people have lived in worse places.  Think of the Count of Monte  Cristo in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If.  And think of the people in  the Bastille!\"    \"The Bastille,\" half whispered Ermengarde, watching her and beginning  to be fascinated.  She remembered stories of the French Revolution  which Sara had been able to fix in her mind by her dramatic relation of  them.  No one but Sara could have done it.    A well-known glow came into Sara's eyes.    \"Yes,\" she said, hugging her knees, \"that will be a good place to  pretend about.  I am a prisoner in the Bastille.  I have been here for  years and years--and years; and everybody has forgotten about me. Miss  Minchin is the jailer--and Becky\"--a sudden light adding itself to the  glow in her eyes--\"Becky is the prisoner in the next cell.\"    She turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara.    \"I shall pretend that,\" she said; \"and it will be a great comfort.\"    Ermengarde was at once enraptured and awed.    \"And will you tell me all about it?\" she said.  \"May I creep up here at  night, whenever it is safe, and hear the things you have made up in the  day?  It will seem as if we were more 'best friends' than ever.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Sara, nodding.  \"Adversity tries people, and mine has  tried you and proved how nice you are.\"        9    Melchisedec      The third person in the trio was Lottie.  She was a small thing and did  not know what adversity meant, and was much bewildered by the  alteration she saw in her young adopted mother. She had heard it  rumored that strange things had happened to Sara, but she could not  understand why she looked different--why she wore an old black frock  and came into the schoolroom only to teach instead of to sit in her  place of honor and learn lessons herself. There had been much  whispering among the little ones when it had been discovered that Sara  no longer lived in the rooms in which Emily had so long sat in state.  Lottie's chief difficulty was that Sara said so little when one asked  her questions.  At seven mysteries must be made very clear if one is to  understand them.    \"Are you very poor now, Sara?\" she had asked confidentially the first  morning her friend took charge of the small French class.  \"Are you as  poor as a beggar?\"  She thrust a fat hand into the slim one and opened  round, tearful eyes.  \"I don't want you to be as poor as a beggar.\"    She looked as if she was going to cry.  And Sara hurriedly consoled her.    \"Beggars have nowhere to live,\" she said courageously.  \"I have a place  to live in.\"    \"Where do you live?\" persisted Lottie.  \"The new girl sleeps in your  room, and it isn't pretty any more.\"    \"I live in another room,\" said Sara.    \"Is it a nice one?\" inquired Lottie.  \"I want to go and see it.\"    \"You must not talk,\" said Sara.  \"Miss Minchin is looking at us.  She  will be angry with me for letting you whisper.\"    She had found out already that she was to be held accountable for  everything which was objected to.  If the children were not attentive,  if they talked, if they were restless, it was she who would be reproved.    But Lottie was a determined little person.  If Sara would not tell her  where she lived, she would find out in some other way.  She talked to  her small companions and hung about the elder girls and listened when  they were gossiping; and acting upon certain information they had  unconsciously let drop, she started late one afternoon on a voyage of  discovery, climbing stairs she had never known the existence of, until  she reached the attic floor. There she found two doors near each other,  and opening one, she saw her beloved Sara standing upon an old table  and looking out of a window.    \"Sara!\" she cried, aghast.  \"Mamma Sara!\"  She was aghast because the  attic was so bare and ugly and seemed so far away from all the world.  Her short legs had seemed to have been mounting hundreds of stairs.    Sara turned round at the sound of her voice.  It was her turn to be  aghast.  What would happen now?  If Lottie began to cry and any one  chanced to hear, they were both lost.  She jumped down from her table  and ran to the child.    \"Don't cry and make a noise,\" she implored.  \"I shall be scolded if you  do, and I have been scolded all day.  It's--it's not such a bad room,  Lottie.\"    \"Isn't it?\" gasped Lottie, and as she looked round it she bit her lip.  She was a spoiled child yet, but she was fond enough of her adopted  parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake. Then,  somehow, it was quite possible that any place in which Sara lived might  turn out to be nice.  \"Why isn't it, Sara?\" she almost whispered.    Sara hugged her close and tried to laugh.  There was a sort of comfort  in the warmth of the plump, childish body.  She had had a hard day and  had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes.    \"You can see all sorts of things you can't see downstairs,\" she said.    \"What sort of things?\" demanded Lottie, with that curiosity Sara could  always awaken even in bigger girls.    \"Chimneys--quite close to us--with smoke curling up in wreaths and  clouds and going up into the sky--and sparrows hopping about and  talking to each other just as if they were people--and other attic  windows where heads may pop out any minute and you can wonder who they  belong to.  And it all feels as high up--as if it was another world.\"    \"Oh, let me see it!\" cried Lottie.  \"Lift me up!\"    Sara lifted her up, and they stood on the old table together and leaned  on the edge of the flat window in the roof, and looked out.    Anyone who has not done this does not know what a different world they  saw.  The slates spread out on either side of them and slanted down  into the rain gutter-pipes. The sparrows, being at home there,  twittered and hopped about quite without fear.  Two of them perched on  the chimney top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until  one pecked the other and drove him away.  The garret window next to  theirs was shut because the house next door was empty.    \"I wish someone lived there,\" Sara said.  \"It is so close that if there  was a little girl in the attic, we could talk to each other through the  windows and climb over to see each other, if we were not afraid of  falling.\"    The sky seemed so much nearer than when one saw it from the street,  that Lottie was enchanted.  From the attic window, among the chimney  pots, the things which were happening in the world below seemed almost  unreal.  One scarcely believed in the existence of Miss Minchin and  Miss Amelia and the schoolroom, and the roll of wheels in the square  seemed a sound belonging to another existence.    \"Oh, Sara!\" cried Lottie, cuddling in her guarding arm. \"I like this  attic--I like it!  It is nicer than downstairs!\"    \"Look at that sparrow,\" whispered Sara.  \"I wish I had some crumbs to  throw to him.\"    \"I have some!\" came in a little shriek from Lottie.  \"I have part of a  bun in my pocket; I bought it with my penny yesterday, and I saved a  bit.\"    When they threw out a few crumbs the sparrow jumped and flew away to an  adjacent chimney top.  He was evidently not accustomed to intimates in  attics, and unexpected crumbs startled him. But when Lottie remained  quite still and Sara chirped very softly--almost as if she were a  sparrow herself--he saw that the thing which had alarmed him  represented hospitality, after all.  He put his head on one side, and  from his perch on the chimney looked down at the crumbs with twinkling  eyes.  Lottie could scarcely keep still.    \"Will he come?  Will he come?\" she whispered.    \"His eyes look as if he would,\" Sara whispered back.  \"He is thinking  and thinking whether he dare.  Yes, he will!  Yes, he is coming!\"    He flew down and hopped toward the crumbs, but stopped a few inches  away from them, putting his head on one side again, as if reflecting on  the chances that Sara and Lottie might turn out to be big cats and jump  on him.  At last his heart told him they were really nicer than they  looked, and he hopped nearer and nearer, darted at the biggest crumb  with a lightning peck, seized it, and carried it away to the other side  of his chimney.    \"Now he KNOWS\", said Sara.  \"And he will come back for the others.\"    He did come back, and even brought a friend, and the friend went away  and brought a relative, and among them they made a hearty meal over  which they twittered and chattered and exclaimed, stopping every now  and then to put their heads on one side and examine Lottie and Sara.  Lottie was so delighted that she quite forgot her first shocked  impression of the attic.  In fact, when she was lifted down from the  table and returned to earthly things, as it were, Sara was able to  point out to her many beauties in the room which she herself would not  have"]]]
