Ambrose, who was Bishop of Milan when  Prudentius was twenty-six years of age, had written the first Latin hymns  to be sung in church. Augustine in a familiar passage of the _Confessions_  (ix. 7.) describes how \"the custom arose of singing hymns and psalms, after  the use of the Eastern provinces, to save the people from being utterly  worn out by their long and sorrowful vigils.\" \"From that day to this,\" he  adds, \"it has been retained and, many might say, all Thy flocks throughout  the rest of the world now follow our example.\" To Ambrose and Augustine the  Church of Christ is for ever indebted: to the latter for a devotional  treatise which is the most familiar of all the writings of the fourth  century: to the former for the hymns of praise which he composed and the  practice of singing which he thus inaugurated in the worship of the  Western Church. But the Church owes something also to Prudentius, a much  more gifted poet than Ambrose. The collection of hymns known as the  _Cathemerinon_ or _Hymns for the day_ is as little adapted for  ecclesiastical worship as Keble's _Christian Year_, although excerpts  from these poems have passed into the hymnology of the Church, just as  portions of Keble's work have passed into most hymn books. For example,  seven of these excerpts in the form of hymns are to be found in the Roman  Breviary, and thus for centuries the lyrics of Prudentius have been sung in  the daily services of the Church.    Seeing that Prudentius must address himself to most English readers through  the imperfect medium of a translation, it may be well to remind those who  make their first acquaintance with him that a historical imagination is an  indispensable condition of interest and sympathy. If Prudentius has a habit  of leaving the main issue and making lengthy and tedious _detours_ into  the picturesque  parables and miraculous incidents of the Old Testament,  there is method in his digressiveness. He knows that one of the charms of  Paganism lies in its rich and variegated mythology. Yet Christianity  also can point to an even nobler inheritance of the supernatural and the  wonderful in the mysterious evolutions of its history. Hence the stories  of the early patriarchs, of the Israelites and Moses, of Daniel and Jonah,  are imported by the poet as pictorial illustrations  of his theme. If  occasionally the details border on the grotesque, he certainly reveals a  striking knowledge of the Old Testament.    The New Testament is also adequately represented. In one poem (ix.) the  miracles of Christ in His earthly ministry and His descent into Hades are  narrated with considerable spirit and eloquence. Besides being a student  of the Bible, Prudentius is a theologian.  His theology is that of the  Nicene Creed. The Fall of man, the personality of the Tempter, the mystery  of the Trinity and of the Incarnation, the Virgin-birth, the Death and  Resurrection of Christ, the pains of the lost and the bliss of the saints,  the resurrection of the Body and the life everlasting--these are the themes  of his pen, the themes too of the theology of his age. If the poet's  treatment of these truths occasionally appears antiquated and crude to  modern ideas, it is at least dignified and intelligent. His mind has  absorbed the Christian religion and the Christian theology, and he not  unfrequently rises to noble heights in the interpretation of their  mysteries. His didactic poems, the _Hamartigenia_ or the _Origin of Evil_  and the _Apotheosis_, a treatise on the Person of Christ, prove him to be  a theologian of no mean calibre. He is also an allegorist, as is proved by  the _Psychomachia_ or the _Battle of the Soul_, a kind of _Holy War_  which was very popular in the Middle Ages.  He is a martyrologist: as  witness the _Peristephanon_, a series of poems on Christian, principally  Spanish, martyrs. Moreover, he is an undoubted patriot, and in the _Contra  Symmachum_, which he wrote on the famous affair of the Altar of Victory,  he proves that, while a Christian, he is also _civis Romanus_, loyal to  the Empire and the powers that be. He is a skilful versifier, and in this  connection the quatrains of the _Dittochaeon_, verses on themes of the Old  and New Testaments, may be mentioned in order to complete the list of his  works. His mastery of his very varied metres--hexameter, iambic, trochaic  and sapphic--is undoubted: everywhere we note the influence of Virgil and  Horace, even when these poets are not recalled by echoes of their diction  which are constantly greeting the reader of his poems.    Reference has already been made to the influence of Ambrose of Milan upon  the thought and style of Prudentius. But there is a second and even more  powerful influence that deserves at least briefly to be noted--namely, the  Christian art of the Catacombs. Apart from such definite statements as  _e.g._ are found in _Peristephanon_ xi., it is obvious that Prudentius  had a first-hand knowledge of Rome and particularly of the Catacombs.  Everywhere in his poems we find evidences of the deep impression made upon  his imagination by the paintings and sculptures of subterranean Rome. The  now familiar representations which decorate the remains of the Catacombs  suggested to him many of the allusions, the picturesque vignettes and  glowing descriptions to be found in his poetry. Thus, the story of Jonah--a  common theme typifying the Resurrection--the story of Daniel with its  obvious consolations for an age of martyrs, the Good Shepherd and the  denial of Peter may be mentioned among the numerous subjects which were  reproduced in early Christian art and transferred by the poet to his verse.  The symbolism of the Cock, the Dove, and the Lamb borne on the shoulders  of the Good Shepherd is a perpetually recurring feature in the lyrics and  martyr-hymns of Prudentius, who thus becomes one of our most valuable  authorities on the Christian art of the fourth century.    The poems, of which a new English rendering is presented in this volume,  are acknowledged by most critics to illustrate some of his best qualities,  his brightness and dignity, his touches of nature-painting and his capacity  for sustained and well-wrought narrative. As we study these lyrics of the  early Church, we feel anew the mighty change that Christianity wrought in  Roman life by its doctrine of immortality, and we note the curious  fascination which the circumstances of the Nativity and especially the  Adoration of the Magi had for the Western world. Prudentius had a  great vogue in the Middle Ages, and the modern renewal of interest in  mediaevalism invests with fresh dignity a poet whose works at the Revival  of learning provoked the admiration of Erasmus[1] and the researches of  numerous scholars and editors. But it is undoubtedly to the student of  ecclesiastical history and dogma and to the lovers of Christian art and  antiquities that Prudentius most truly appeals. He claims our interest,  not merely because he reflects the Christian environment of his days, but  because his poetry represents an attempt to preach Christ to a world still  fascinated by Paganism, while conscious that the old order was changing  and yielding place to new.    [1] _Prudentium, unum inter Christianos vere facundum poetam._                                             NOTES                                     HYMNS                                       THE TITLE    The word _Cathemerinon_ is taken from the Greek and is the genitive of  _chathemerina_ \"daily things\": the whole title _Liber Cathemerinon_  is equivalent to \"Book of daily hymns,\" and may be rendered \"Hymns for  the Christian's day.\"                                      THE PREFACE    In one or two of the MSS. this introductory poem is stated to be a preface  of the _Cathemerinon_ only: but the great majority of the codices support  the view which is undoubtedly suggested by internal evidence, that the poem  is a general introduction to the whole of Prudentius' works. It is inserted  together with the _Epilogus_ in this volume, because of the intrinsic  interest of both poems.    Line    8     The reference is to the _toga virilis_, the ordinary       white-coloured garb of a Roman citizen who at his sixteenth year       laid aside the purple-edged _toga praetexta_, which was worn       during the days of boyhood.    16 ff.     The cities referred to are unknown: but it is probable that       they were two _municipia_ in Northern Spain, and that the office       held by Prudentius was that of duumvir or prefect. Provision was made       by the twenty-fourth clause of the law of Salpensa (a town in the       _provincia Baetica_ of Spain) by which the emperor could be elected       first magistrate of a _municipium_, and could thereupon appoint a       prefect to take his place. This would explain the language of the       text as to the semi-imperial nature of the post. The phrase       _militiae gradus_ need only be taken to indicate advancement in the       _civil_ service. But the words have been interpreted in accordance       with the more familiar and definite meaning of _militia_, and       understood to refer to a purely military post. Dressel thinks that       Prudentius was a _miles Palatinus_, that is, a member of the       best-paid and most highly-privileged imperial troops, who furnished       officers for some of the most lucrative posts in the provinces.       Though in the translation the usual meaning has been given to       _militia_, it must be regarded as uncertain in the absence of       more definite information regarding the office held by Prudentius.    24     The consulship of Salia (or Salias) belongs to the year 348, the       date of the birth of Prudentius.

On the other hand one gains the  impression that the existence of love in childhood is in no need of  demonstration. Perez (l.c.) speaks for it; K. Groos (Die Spiele der  Menschen, 1899) states that some children are very early subject to  sexual emotions, and show a desire to touch the other sex (p. 336); S.  Bell observed the earliest appearance of sex-love in a child during the  middle part of its third year. See also Havelock Ellis, The Sexual  Impulse, Appendix II.    The above-mentioned judgment concerning the literature of infantile  sexuality no longer holds true since the appearance of the great and  important work of G. Stanley Hall (Adolescence, Its Psychology and its  Relation to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion,  and Education, 2 vols., New York, 1908). The recent book of A. Moll, Das  Sexualleben des Kindes, Berlin, 1909, offers no occasion for such a  modification. See, on the other hand, Bleuler, Sexuelle abnormitaeten der  Kinder (Jahrbuch der Schweizerischen Gesellschaft fuer  Schulgesundheitspflege, IX, 1908). A book by Mrs. Dr. H.v. Hug-Hellmuth,  Aus dem Seelenleben des Kindes (1913), has taken full account of the  neglected sexual factors. [Translated in Monograph Series.]    [3] I have attempted to solve the problems presented by the earliest  infantile recollections in a paper, \"Ueber Deckerinnerungen\"  (Monatsschrift fuer Psychiatrie und Neurologie, VI, 1899). Cf. also The  Psychopathology of Everyday Life, The Macmillan Co., New York, and  Unwin, London.    [4] One cannot understand the mechanism of repression when one takes  into consideration only one of the two cooperating processes. As a  comparison one may think of the way the tourist is despatched to the top  of the great pyramid of Gizeh; he is pushed from one side and pulled  from the other.    [5] The use of the latter material is justified by the fact that the  years of childhood of those who are later neurotics need not necessarily  differ from those who are later normal except in intensity and  distinctness.    [6] An anatomic analogy to the behavior of the infantile sexual function  formulated by me is perhaps given by Bayer (Deutsches Archiv fuer  klinische Medizin, Bd. 73) who claims that the internal genitals  (uterus) are regularly larger in newborn than in older children.  However, Halban's conception, that after birth there is also an  involution of the other parts of the sexual apparatus, has not been  verified. According to Halban (Zeitschrift fuer Geburtshilfe u.  Gynaekologie, LIII, 1904) this process of involution ends after a few  weeks of extra-uterine life.    [7] The expression \"sexual latency period\" (sexuelle latenz-periode) I  have borrowed from W. Fliess.    [8] In the case here discussed the sublimation of the sexual motive  powers proceed on the road of reaction formations. But in general it is  necessary to separate from each other sublimation and reaction formation  as two diverse processes. Sublimation may also result through other and  simpler mechanisms.    [9] Jahrbuch fuer Kinderheilkunde, N.F., XIV, 1879.    [10] This already shows what holds true for the whole life, namely, that  sexual gratification is the best hypnotic. Most nervous insomnias are  traced to lack of sexual gratification. It is also known that  unscrupulous nurses calm crying children to sleep by stroking their  genitals.    [11] Ellis spoils, however, the sense of his invented term by comprising  under the phenomena of autoerotism the whole of hysteria and  masturbation in its full extent.    [12] Further reflection and observation lead me to attribute the quality  of erogenity to all parts of the body and inner organs. See later on  narcism.    [13] Compare here the very comprehensive but confusing literature on  onanism, _e.g._, Rohleder, Die Masturbation, 1899. Cf. also the  pamphlet, \"Die Onanie,\" which contains the discussion of the Vienna  Psychoanalytic Society, Wiesbaden, 1912.    [14] Compare here the essay on \"Charakter und Analerotic\" in the  Sammlung kleiner Schriften zur Neurosenlehre, Zweite Folge, 1909. Cf.  also Brill, Psychanalysis, Chap. XIII, Anal Eroticism and Character,  W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia.    [15] Unusual techniques in the performance of onanism seem to point to  the influence of a prohibition against onanism which has been overcome.    [16] Why neurotics, when conscience stricken, regularly connect it with  their onanistic activity, as was only recently recognized by Bleuler, is  a problem which still awaits an exhaustive analysis.    [17] Freud, Selected Papers on Hysteria and Other Psychoneuroses, 3d  edition, translated by A.A. Brill, N.Y. Nerv. and Ment. Dis. Pub. Co.  Nervous and Mental Disease Monograph, Series No. 4.    [18] Havelock Ellis, in an appendix to his study on the Sexual Impulse,  1903, gives a number of autobiographic reports of normal persons  treating their first sexual feelings in childhood and the causes of the  same. These reports naturally show the deficiency due to infantile  amnesia; they do not cover the prehistoric time in the sexual life and  therefore must be supplemented by psychoanalysis of individuals who  became neurotic. Notwithstanding this these reports are valuable in more  than one respect, and information of a similar nature has urged me to  modify my etiological assumption as mentioned in the text.    [19] The above-mentioned assertions concerning the infantile sexuality  were justified in 1905, in the main through the results of  psychoanalytic investigations in adults. Direct observation of the child  could not at the time be utilized to its full extent and resulted only  in individual indications and valuable confirmations. Since then it has  become possible through the analysis of some cases of nervous disease in  the delicate age of childhood to gain a direct understanding of the  infantile psychosexuality (Jahrbuch fuer psychoanalytische und  psychopathologische Forschungen, Bd. 1, 2, 1909). I can point with  satisfaction to the fact that direct observation has fully confirmed the  conclusion drawn from psychoanalysis, and thus furnishes good evidence  for the reliability of the latter method of investigation.    Moreover, the \"Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy\" (Jahrbuch,  Bd. 1) has taught us something new for which psychoanalysis had not  prepared us, to wit, that sexual symbolism, the representation of the  sexual by non-sexual objects and relations--reaches back into the years  when the child is first learning to master the language. My attention  has also been directed to a deficiency in the above-cited statement  which for the sake of clearness described any conceivable separation  between the two phases of autoerotism and object love as a temporal  separation. From the cited analysis (as well as from the above-mentioned  work of Bell) we learn that children from three to five are capable of  evincing a very strong object-selection which is accompanied by strong  affects.    [20] Some persons can recall that the contact of the moving air in  swinging caused them direct sexual pleasure in the genitals.    [21] \"Those who love each other tease each other.\"    [22] The analyses of neurotic disturbances of walking and of agoraphobia  remove all doubt as to the sexual nature of the pleasure of motion. As  everybody knows modern cultural education utilizes sports to a great  extent in order to turn away the youth from sexual activity; it would be  more proper to say that it replaces the sexual pleasure by motion  pleasure, and forces the sexual activity back upon one of its autoerotic  components.          III    THE TRANSFORMATION OF PUBERTY      With the beginning of puberty the changes set in which transform the  infantile sexual life into its definite normal form. Hitherto the sexual  impulse has been preponderantly autoerotic; it now finds the sexual  object. Thus far it has manifested itself in single impulses and in  erogenous zones seeking a certain pleasure as a single sexual aim. A new  sexual aim now appears for the production of which all partial impulses  cooeperate, while the erogenous zones subordinate themselves to the  primacy of the genital zone.[1] As the new sexual aim assigns very  different functions to the two sexes their sexual developments now part  company. The sexual development of the man is more consistent and easier  to understand, while in the woman there even appears a form of  regression. The normality of the sexual life is guaranteed only by the  exact concurrence of the two streams directed to the sexual object and  sexual aim. It is like the piercing of a tunnel from opposite sides.    The new sexual aim in the man consists in the discharging of the sexual  products; it is not contradictory to the former sexual aim, that of  obtaining pleasure; on the contrary, the highest amount of pleasure is  connected with this final act in the sexual process. The sexual impulse  now enters into the service of the function of propagation; it becomes,  so to say, altruistic. If this transformation is to succeed its process  must be adjusted to the original dispositions and all the peculiarities  of the impulses.    Just as on every other occasion where new connections and compositions  are to be formed in complicated mechanisms, here, too, there is a  possibility for morbid disturbance if the new order of things does not  get itself established. All morbid disturbances of the sexual life may  justly be considered as inhibitions of development.      THE PRIMACY OF THE GENITAL ZONES AND THE FORE-PLEASURE    From the course of development as described we can clearly see the issue  and the end aim. The intermediary transitions are still quite obscure  and many a riddle will have to be solved in them.    The most striking process of puberty has been selected as its most  characteristic; it is the manifest growth of the external genitals which  have shown a relative"]]]
