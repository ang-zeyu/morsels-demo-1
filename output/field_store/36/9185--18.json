[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16130"],[0,"Judgments of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand on Proceedings to Review Aspects (#16)"],[1,"during his  second appearance it is worthwhile making a preliminary comment. No  complaint has ever been made by Mr Chippindale about a missing blue  envelope or papers within it. If Captain Gemmell had been entrusted with  such a mission which he had failed to discharge Mr Chippindale would  seem to be the first person who would want to know why. He himself gave  evidence before the Royal Commission for a period of ten days and during  all that time he was never asked about this matter. Nor was he recalled  to deal with it after it had been raised with Captain Gemmell or after  First Officer Rhodes gave his further evidence. That fact alone might be  thought sufficient to dispose of the matter. And in the end the  Commissioner himself decided that neither this nor other evidence could  justify a finding against Captain Gemmell that he \"recovered documents  from Antarctica which were relevant to the fatal flight, and which he  did not account for to the proper authorities\".    It is necessary to describe all this because the second appearance of  First Officer Rhodes resulted in a finding in paragraph 348 of the Royal  Commission Report which reflects seriously upon the conduct of another  executive officer of the airline, Captain Eden. The paragraph is another  of those challenged in the present proceedings.    It seems that First Officer Rhodes agreed to give evidence on the second  occasion in order to remove any false impression that he himself doubted  the integrity of Captain Gemmell. The following extract from the  transcript explains the position (a condensed version appears in  paragraph 347 of the Report):         \"You've already given evidence and stated your qualification. I       think you have offered to give some supplementary evidence relating       to activity at the Erebus crash site ... Our discussion with Capt.       Eden last Friday indicated this would be appreciated.         I think just as Capt. Gemmell was there representing the co. you       were there as a rep. of ALPA.... Thats correct.         May we take it that you worked in conjunction with Capt. Gemmell       and other members of the team involved.... Correct.         And in so doing you were present at the crash site with Capt.       Gemmell.... No we had different tasks as I was in the area with       Capt. Gemmell at some stages.         So far as your observations are concerned what would you have to       say regarding Capt. Gemmell's conduct and behaviour in the course       of his duties there.... I have no reason to doubt Capt. Gemmell in       any way shape or form.         Have you ever suggested otherwise to anybody.... I have not.\"    Then he was cross-examined by counsel for the Association whose witness  he had been earlier. He was asked about Captain Gemmell's work at the  actual scene of the disaster and his explanation about that matter is  reflected in the following question and answer:         \"Did you see Capt. Gemmell at any time in the cockpit area or       thereabouts working on his own.... I qualified that before. Working       on your own is a relative term. At all stages there would be       somebody adjacent for your own safety and well-being. I did not at       any stage see Ian Gemmell Capt. Gemmell or Ian Wood or David Graham       in total isolation in any part of the wreckage.\"    Then there is mention of material that may have been returned by Captain  Gemmell to New Zealand--         \"You heard question the other day concerning Capt. Gemmell       returning from McMurdo with an envelope containing property can you       tell us about that.... At the stage that Capt. Gemmell was       returning to N.Z. he was asked by the Chief Inspector of Accidents       if he would return to N.Z. with one or more envelopes I cannot       recall how many containing photos and perhaps other information to       be used in the conduct of the inquiry at a later date but       specifically at that early date the intention was for Capt. Gemmell       to brief the Minister and the Dir. of CAD and senior execs, of Air       N.Z. as to what had transpired at that early date in the       investigation. As Mr Chippindale would be staying in the Ant. and       the remainder of his team would be with him or else in the US.         What about private property.... The envelopes which Capt. Gemmell       return to N.Z. with may have contained some documentation from the       crash site which was beginning to return in significant quantities       from the various people on the crash site including the police.\"    The following portion of the cross-examination then refers to documents  described as \"the technical crews flying records, the collection of log  books, licences and other relevant documentation\". He said that at first  there was reluctance on the part of Air New Zealand to release this  material \"as it was not clear at that stage in many peoples minds what  my duties were\". It was not immediately appreciated that he was acting  on Mr Chippindale's behalf. He was then asked--         \"And Air N.Z. and Capt. Gemmell released to you the material which       you'd previously sought.... Correct\".    Concerning all this evidence the Commissioner expressed the following  conclusions in paragraph 348:         \"Captain Eden is at present the director of flight operations for       the airline. He appeared in the witness box to be a strong-minded       and aggressive official. It seemed clear from this further       production of First Officer Rhodes as a witness that it had been       suggested to him by Captain Eden that he should either make a       direct allegation against Captain Gemmell or else make no       allegation at all, and that since First Officer Rhodes seemed to       have no direct evidence in his possession, he was therefore obliged       to give the answer which Captain Eden had either suggested or       directed. However, First Officer Rhodes was not entirely       intimidated because as will be observed from the evidence just       quoted, he insisted on saying that Captain Gemmell had brought an       envelope containing documents back to Auckland.\"    Those statements are in no way related to the assessment of Captain  Eden's evidence or as Captain Eden as a witness. They are observations  that Captain Eden had attempted to influence or direct the evidence to  be given by First Officer Rhodes by a process of intimidation. Counsel  for First Officer Rhodes' own association had made no suggestion to that  effect. Nor is there any hint by First Officer Rhodes himself that he  was present as anything but a voluntary witness. The answer he gave to  the opening question would not seem to support suspicions of  intimidation. And that answer is itself followed by quite a generous  tribute to Captain Gemmell. But the reputation of Captain Eden and the  support given Captain Gemmell is dismissed by a finding of intimidation.  It should be said as well that although Captain Eden himself appeared to  give evidence three days later not a word was said to him by anybody to  suggest that earlier he had been guilty of attempting to intimidate a  witness.      Specific documents    To the extent that the Royal Commission Report has pointed to any  particular classes of documentary material that did not reach the  Inquiry the list is not a long one. It comprises--         1. Unidentified papers within the blue envelope--No complaint about       this was ever made by Mr Chippindale as we have mentioned.         2. Papers given to First Officer Cassin as briefing material--It       has been explained that if any complaint could be made about this       matter it would affect Captain Crosbie, the unnamed \"employee of       the airline\" referred to in paragraph 52. It was he who went to the       Cassin home for compassionate reasons as the spokesman for the       Airline Pilots Association. He denies ever receiving the material.       Even if he had, the Report has not challenged the conduct of any of       the line pilots. This matter would seem to be irrelevant.         3. Documents or papers that may have been shredded by Mr Oldfield       following the decision of the in-house committee which met during       the week beginning 3rd December 1979--This matter requires no       further discussion.         4. Pages within the cover of a ring-binder notebook of Captain       Collins--This matter too was handled by Captain Crosbie. However,       it requires some specific mention because in paragraph 352 it has       been associated with Captain Gemmell and as all counsel now       acknowledge this has been done in error. The paragraph is one of       the specific paragraphs challenged by these proceedings.         5. Briefing or other flight documents (including a New Zealand       Atlas) taken onto the aircraft within Captain Collins' flight bag;       and similar papers within a flight bag owned by First Officer       Cassin--This matter also requires discussion.      The Ring-binder Notebook    The Commissioner found that Captain Collins carried with him on the  fatal flight a small pocket diary usually kept in his breast pocket; and  a ring-binder losse-leaf notebook carried in his flight bag. It is said  in paragraph 351 \"that the chief inspector had obtained possession of  the small pocket diary, but it did not contain any particulars relating  to Antarctica flights\". At the hearing Mrs Collins described the diary  and said that on 12th December 1979 Captain Crosbie had returned it to  her together with certain other items of personal property belonging to  her husband. She explained that there were no pages in the ring-binder  when she received it \"other than some loose papers which are still  folded inside the front cover\". The question arose as to what had  happened, to the balance of the contents of the notebook.

I could have cried to look at them lying so cold and still. They  had been so brave in the morning, so strong; but in the evening, a few  little hours, they were dead, and we had not hated them, nor they us. Yes,  I could have cried as I thought of the women who would wait for them in  Australia. Yes, I could have shed tears, though they had wounded me, but  then I thought of my father, and of the mother, and little Yacoba on the  farm, who would wait in vain for _him_, and then I could feel sorry  for those, the wives and children of the dead men, no longer.\"                                    LIFE IN THE BOER CAMPS.                                             HEADQUARTERS, ORANGE RIVER COLONY.      It is an article of faith with many people that a Boer commando is a mere  mob, that its leaders exercise no control over men in laager or on the  field, and that punishment for crimes is a thing unknown. But this is far  from being the case. It is quite true that a Boer soldier does not know how  to click his heels together, turn his toes to an acute angle, stiffen his  back, and salute every time an officer runs against him. He could not  properly perform any of the very simplest military evolutions common to all  European soldiers if his immortal welfare depended upon it. That is why he  is such a failure as an attacking agent. Still, in spite of these things,  the Boer on commando has to submit to very rigid laws. The penalty for  outrage, or attempted outrage, on a woman is instant death on conviction,  no matter what the woman's nationality may be. For sleeping on sentry duty  the punishment is unique; it is a punishment born of long dwelling in the  wilderness. It is of such a nature that no man who has once undergone it is  calculated ever to forget. When a clear case is made out against a burgher  by trial before his commandant the whole commando in laager is summoned to  witness the criminal's reward. He is taken out beyond the lines to a spot  where the sun shines in all its unprotected fierceness. He is led to an  ant-hill full of busy, wicked, little crawlers; the top of the ant-hill is  cut off with a spade, leaving a honeycombed surface for the sleepy one to  stand upon (not much fear of him sleeping whilst he is there). He is  ordered to mount the hill and stand with feet close together. His rifle is  placed in his hands, the butt resting between his toes, the muzzle clasped  in both hands. Two men are then told off to watch him. They are picked men,  noted for their stern, unyielding sense of duty and love for the cause they  fight for.    These guards lie down in the veldt twenty-five yards away from the victim.  They have their loaded Mausers with them, and their orders are, if the  prisoner lifts a leg, to put a bullet into it; if he lifts an arm, a bullet  goes into that defaulting member; if he jumps down from his perch  altogether, the leaden messengers sent from both rifles will cancel all his  earthly obligations. The sun shines down in savage mockery; it strikes upon  the bare neck of the quivering wretch, who dare not lift a hand to shift  his hat to cover the blistering skin. It strikes in his eyes and burns his  lips until they swell and feel like bursting. The barrel of his rifle grows  hotter and hotter, until his fingers feel as if glued to a gridiron. The  very clothes upon his body burn the skin beneath. He feels desperate; he  must shift one arm, for the anguish is intolerable. He makes an almost  imperceptible movement of his shoulder, and glances towards his guards. The  man on his right front lays his pipe quickly in the grass, and swiftly  lifts his Mauser to his shoulder. The wretch on the ant-heap closes his  eyes with a groan, and stands as still as a Japanese god carved out of  jute-wood. The guard lays down his rifle and picks up his pipe.    The sun climbs higher and higher, until it gleams down straight into the  ant-heap; the scorching heat penetrates into the unprotected cells, and  enrages the dwellers inside. They swarm out full of fight, like an army  lusting for battle. Their home has been ravished of the protection they had  raised with half a lifetime of labour, and in their puny way they want  vengeance. They find a foe on top, a man ready to their wrath. They crawl  into his scorched boots, over his baked feet, guiltless of stockings; they  charge up the legs, on which the trousers hang loosely, and as they charge  they bite, because they are out for business, not for a picnic. The very  stillness of their victim seems to enrage them. The first legion retires at  full speed down into the ant-heap again. They have gone for recruits. In a  few seconds up they come again, until the very top of the heap is alive  with them. They climb one over another in their eagerness to get in their  individual moiety of revenge. Down into the veldtschoon, up the bare, hairy  legs, over the hips, round the waist, over the lean ribs, along the spine,  under the arms, round the neck, over the whole man they go, as the  Mongolian hordes will some day go over the Western world. And each one digs  his tiny prongs into the smarting, burning, itching poor devil on top of  their homestead. He shifts a leg the hundredth part of an inch. The guard  on the left gives his bandolier a warning twist, and glances along the long  brown barrel that nestles in the hollow of his left hand.    The commandant comes out of the circle of burghers, looks at the victim,  sees that the eyes are bloodshot and protruding far beyond the normal  position. He is not a hard man, but he knows that the culprit has  endangered the lives and liberties of all. \"You will remember this,\" he  says sternly; \"you will not again sleep when it is your turn to watch.\"  \"Never, so help me God!\" gasps the prisoner. \"Stand down, then; you are  free.\" Quicker than a swallow's flight is the movement of the liberated  man. He drops his rifle with a gasp of relief, tears every stitch of  clothing from his body, throws the garments from him, and pelts his  veldtschoon after them. Some sympathetic veteran, who has possibly, in  earlier wars, been through the ordeal himself, runs up with a drink of  blessed water. He does not drink it; he pours it down his burning throat,  then sits on the grass, drawing his breath in long, sobbing sighs, all the  more terrible because they are tearless. From head to heel he is covered  with tiny red marks, just like a schoolboy who has had the measles; in  three days there will not be a mark on him, but he won't forget them, all  the same, not in thirty-three years, or three hundred and thirty-three, if  he happens to have a memory of any kind at that period.    This mode of punishing recalcitrant persons was picked up, I am told, from  one of the savage tribes. I do not know if this is so or not, but there is  no doubt that the niggers know all about it, because one day, when I found  that one of my niggers had been helping himself lavishly to my tobacco, I  promised to stand him on an ant-heap as soon as I had finished shaving.  Five minutes later my other nigger, Lazarus, came into my tent and informed  me that Johnnie had bolted. I went out, and by the aid of my glasses I  could just espy a black dot away out on the veldt, making a rapid and  direct line for the land of the Basutos; and that was the last I ever saw  or heard of tobacco-loving, work-dodging, truth-twisting Johnnie.    There is a distinctly humorous side to the Boer character, which crops out  sometimes in his methods of dealing out justice to those who have done the  thing that seems evil in his sight. If there is a fellow in laager who is  not amenable to orders, one of those malcontents who desires to have  everything his own way--and there generally is one of these cherubs in  every large gathering of men all the world over--the commandant first calls  him up and warns him that he is making himself a pest to the whole  commando, and exhorts him to mend his manners. As a general thing the  commandant throws a few slabs of Scripture appropriate to the occasion at  the disturber's ears, and mixes it judiciously with a good deal of worldly  wisdom, all of which tending to teach the fellow that he is about as  desirable as a comrade as a sore eye in a sand-storm. Should the  exhortation not have the desired effect, and the offender continue to stir  up strife in laager, as a lame mule stirs up mud in midstream, then the  commandant sends a guard of young men to gather in the unruly one. He is  captured with as little ceremony as a nigger captures a hog in the midst of  his mealy patch. They strip him bare to the waist, and put a bridle on his  head; the bit is jammed into his mouth, and firmly buckled there, and then  the circus begins. One of the guards takes the reins, usually a couple of  long lengths of raw hide; another flicks the human steed on the bare ribs  with a sjambok, and he is ordered to show his paces. He has to walk, trot,  canter, gallop, and \"tripple\" all around the laager several times, amidst  the badinage and laughter of the burghers, and he gets enough \"chaff\"  during the journey to last the biggest horse in England a lifetime.    It is bad enough when there are only men there, but when there are, as is  often the case, a dozen or two of women and girls present his woe is served  up to him full measure and brimming over. The men roar with laughter, and  pelt him with crusts of rusks, but the women and girls make his life an  agony for the time being. They smile at him sweetly, and ask him if he  feels lonely without a cart, or they pull up a handful of grass and offer  it to him on the end of a stick, making a lot of \"stage aside\" remarks  concerning the length of his ears the while, until the fellow's face  crimsons with shame.    They are wonderfully patriotic, these Boer girls and women, and are  merciless in their contempt for a man who will not do his"]]]
