I was not at this time in a higher latitude than 36  degrees 40 minutes, and oftentimes was more northerly, altering my  latitude often as winds and weather required; for in such long runs it is  best to shape one's course according to the winds. And if in steering to  the east we should be obliged to bear a little to the north or south of  it it is no great matter; for it is but sailing 2 or 3 points from the  wind when it is either northerly or southerly; and this not only eases  the ship from straining but shortens the way more than if a ship was kept  close on a wind, as some men are fond of doing.    THE AUTHOR'S COURSE TO NEW HOLLAND; AND SIGNS OF APPROACHING IT.    The 19th of June we were in latitude 34 degrees 17 minutes south and  longitude from the Cape 39 degrees 24 minutes east, and had small gales  and calms. The winds were at north-east by east and continued in some  part of the east till the 27th day. When it having been some time at  north-north-east it came about at north and then to the west of the  north, and continued in the west-board (between the north-north-west and  south-south-west) till the 4th of July; in which time we ran 782 miles;  then the winds came about again to the east, we reckoning ourselves to be  in a meridian 1100 leagues east of the Cape; and, having fair weather,  sounded, but had no ground.    We met with little of remark in this voyage, besides being accompanied  with fowls all the way, especially pintado-birds, and seeing now and then  a whale: but as we drew nigher the coast of New Holland we saw frequently  3 or 4 whales together. When we were about 90 leagues from the land we  began to see seaweeds, all of one sort; and as we drew nigher the shore  we saw them more frequently. At about 30 leagues distance we began to see  some scuttle-bones floating on the water; and drawing still nigher the  land we saw greater quantities of them.    July 25, being in latitude 26 degrees 14 minutes south and longitude east  from the Cape of Good Hope 85 degrees 52 minutes, we saw a large garfish  leap 4 times by us, which seemed to be as big as a porpoise. It was now  very fair weather, and the sea was full of a sort of very small grass or  moss, which as it floated in the water seemed to have been some spawn of  fish; and there was among it some small fry. The next day the sea was  full of small round things like pearl, some as big as white peas; they  were very clear and transparent, and upon crushing any of them a drop of  water would come forth: the skin that contained the water was so thin  that it was but just discernable. Some weeds swam by us so that we did  not doubt but we should quickly see land. On the 27th also some weeds  swam by us, and the birds that had flown along with us all the way almost  from Brazil now left us, except only 2 or 3 shearwaters. On the 28th we  saw many weeds swim by us and some whales, blowing. On the 29th we had  dark cloudy weather with much thunder, lightning, and violent rains in  the morning; but in the evening it grew fair. We saw this day a  scuttle-bone swim by us, and some of our young men a seal, as it should  seem by their description of its head. I saw also some bonetas, and some  skipjacks, a fish about 8 inches long, broad, and sizable, not much  unlike a roach; which our seamen call so from their leaping about.    ANOTHER ABROLHO SHOAL AND STORM, AND THE AUTHOR'S ARRIVAL ON PART OF NEW  HOLLAND.    The 30th of July, being still nearer the land, we saw abundance of  scuttle-bones and seaweed, more tokens that we were not far from it; and  saw also a sort of fowls, the like of which we had not seen in the whole  voyage, all the other fowls having now left us. These were as big as  lapwings; of a grey colour, black about their eyes, with red sharp bills,  long wings, their tails long and forked like swallows; and they flew  flapping their wings like lapwings. In the afternoon we met with a  rippling tide or current, or the water of some shoal or overfall; but  were past it before we could sound. The birds last mentioned and this  were further signs of land. In the evening we had fair weather and a  small gale at west. At 8 o'clock we sounded again; but had no ground.    We kept on still to the eastward, with an easy sail looking out sharp:  for by the many signs we had I did expect that we were near the land. At  12 o'clock in the night I sounded and had 45 fathom, coarse sand and  small white shells. I presently clapped on a wind and stood to the south,  with the wind at west, because I thought we were to the south of a shoal  called the Abrolhos (an appellative name for shoals as it seems to me)  which in a chart I had of that coast is laid down in 27 degrees 28  minutes latitude stretching about 7 leagues into the sea. I was the day  before in 27 degrees 38 minutes by reckoning. And afterwards, steering  east by south purposely to avoid it, I thought I must have been to the  south of it: but sounding again at 1 o'clock in the morning August the  first, we had but 25 fathom, coral rocks; and so found the shoal was to  the south of us. We presently tacked again, and stood to the north, and  then soon deepened our water; for at 2 in the morning we had 26 fathom  coral still: at 3 we had 28 coral ground: at 4 we had 30 fathom, coarse  sand, with some coral: at 5 we had 45 fathom, coarse sand and shells;  being now off the shoal, as appeared by the sand and shells, and by  having left the coral. By all this I knew we had fallen into the north of  the shoal, and that it was laid down wrong in my sea-chart: for I found  it lie in about 27 degrees latitude, and by our run in the next day I  found that the outward edge of it, which I sounded on, lies 16 leagues  off shore. When it was day we steered in east-north-east with a fine  brisk gale; but did not see the land till 9 in the morning, when we saw  it from our topmast-head, and were distant from it about 10 leagues;  having then 40 fathom water, and clean sand. About 3 hours after we saw  it on our quarter-deck, being by judgment about 6 leagues off, and we had  then 40 fathom, clean sand. As we ran in this day and the next we took  several sights of it, at different bearings and distances; from which it  appeared as you see. And here I would note once for all that the  latitudes marked in the draughts, or sights here given, are not the  latitude of the land, but of the ship when the sight was taken. This  morning, August the first, as we were standing in, we saw several large  seafowls, like our gannets on the coast of England, flying 3 or 4  together; and a sort of white seamews, but black about the eyes, and with  forked tails. We strove to run in near the shore to seek for a harbour to  refresh us after our tedious voyage; having made one continued stretch  from Brazil hither of about 114 degrees designing from hence also to  begin the discovery I had a mind to make on New Holland and New Guinea.  The land was low, and appeared even, and as we drew nearer to it it made  with some red and some white cliffs; these last in latitude 26 10 south,  where you will find 54 fathom within 4 miles of the shore.    THAT PART DESCRIBED, AND SHARK'S BAY, WHERE HE FIRST ANCHORS.    About the latitude of 26 degrees south we saw an opening, and ran in,  hoping to find a harbour there: but when we came to its mouth, which was  about 2 leagues wide, we saw rocks and foul ground within, and therefore  stood out again: there we had 20 fathom water within 2 mile of the shore.  The land everywhere appeared pretty low, flat and even; but with steep  cliffs to the sea; and when we came near it there were no trees, shrubs  or grass to be seen. The soundings in the latitude of 26 degrees south,  from about 8 or 9 leagues off till you come within a league of the shore,  are generally about 40 fathom; differing but little, seldom above 3 or 4  fathom. But the lead brings up very different sorts of sand, some coarse,  some fine; and of several colours, as yellow, white, grey, brown, bluish  and reddish.    When I saw there was no harbour here, nor good anchoring, I stood off to  sea again, in the evening of the second of August, fearing a storm on a  lee shore, in a place where there was no shelter, and desiring at least  to have sea-room: for the clouds began to grow thick in the western  board, and the wind was already there, and began to blow fresh almost  upon the shore; which at this place lies along north-north-west and  south-south-east. By 9 o'clock at night we had got a pretty good offing;  but, the wind still increasing, I took in my main topsail, being able to  carry no more sail than two courses and the mizzen. At 2 in the morning  August 3 it blew very hard, and the sea was much raised; so that I furled  all my sails but my mainsail. Though the wind blew so hard we had pretty  clear weather till noon: but then the whole sky was blackened with thick  clouds, and we had some rain, which would last a quarter of an hour at a  time, and then it would blow very fierce while the squalls of rain were  over our heads; but as soon as they were gone the wind was by much  abated, the stress of the storm being over. We sounded several times, but  had no ground till 8 o'clock August the 4th in the evening; and then had  60 fathom water, coral ground. At 10 we had 56 fathom fine sand. At 12 we  had 55 fathom, fine sand, of a pale bluish colour. It was now pretty  moderate weather; yet I made no sail till morning; but then, the wind  veering about to the south-west, I made sail and stood to the north: and  at 11 o'clock the next day August 5 we saw land again, at about 10  leagues distance. This noon we "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],[0,"True Stories of History and Biography (#16)"],[1,"since the departure of Colonel Shute. Governor Burnet  took up his residence with Mr. Cooke, while the Province House was  undergoing repairs. During this period, he was always complimented with a  seat in Grandfather's chair; and so comfortable did he find it, that on  removing to the Province House, he could not bear to leave it behind him.  Mr. Cooke, therefore, requested his acceptance of it.    \"I should think,\" said Laurence, \"that the people would have petitioned  the king always to appoint a native-born New Englander to govern them.\"    \"Undoubtedly it was a grievance,\" answered Grandfather, \"to see men placed  in this station, who perhaps had neither talents nor virtues to fit them  for it, and who certainly could have no natural affection for the country.  The king generally bestowed the governorships of the American colonies  upon needy noblemen, or hangers-on at court, or disbanded officers. The  people knew that such persons would be very likely to make the good of the  country subservient to the wishes of the king. The legislature, therefore,  endeavored to keep as much power as possible in their own hands, by  refusing to settle a fixed salary upon the governors. It was thought  better to pay them according to their deserts.\"    \"Did Governor Burnet work well for his money?\" asked Charley.    Grandfather could not help smiling at the simplicity of Charley's  question. Nevertheless, it put the matter in a very plain point of view.    He then described the character of Governor Burnet, representing him as a  good scholar, possessed of much ability, and likewise of unspotted  integrity. His story affords a striking example, how unfortunate it is for  a man, who is placed as ruler over a country, to be compelled to aim at  any thing but the good of the people. Governor Burnet was so chained down  by his instructions from the king, that he could not act as he might  otherwise have wished. Consequently, his whole term of office was wasted  in quarrels with the legislature.    \"I am afraid, children,\" said Grandfather, \"that Governor Burnet found but  little rest or comfort in our old chair. Here he used to sit, dressed in a  coat which was made of rough, shaggy cloth outside, but of smooth velvet  within. It was said that his own character resembled that coat, for his  outward manner was rough, but his inward disposition soft and kind. It is  a pity that such a man could not have been kept free from trouble. But so  harassing were his disputes with the representatives of the people, that  he fell into a fever, of which he died, in 1720. The legislature had  refused him a salary, while alive; but they appropriated money enough to  give him a splendid and pompous funeral.\"    And now Grandfather perceived that little Alice had fallen fast asleep,  with her head upon his footstool. Indeed, as Clara observed, she had been  sleeping from the time of Sir Hovenden Walker's expedition against Quebec,  until the death of Governor Burnet--a period of about eighteen years. And  yet, after so long a nap, sweet little Alice was a golden-haired child, of  scarcely five years old.    \"It puts me in mind,\" said Laurence, \"of the story of the enchanted  princess, who slept many a hundred years, and awoke as young and beautiful  as ever.\"          Chapter VII      A few evenings afterwards, cousin Clara happened to inquire of  Grandfather, whether the old chair had never been present at a ball. At  the same time, little Alice brought forward a doll, with whom she had been  holding a long conversation.    \"See, Grandfather,\" cried she. \"Did such a pretty lady as this ever sit in  your great chair?\"    These questions led Grandfather to talk about the fashions and manners,  which now began to be introduced from England into the provinces. The  simplicity of the good old Puritan times was fast disappearing. This was  partly owing to the increasing number and wealth of the inhabitants, and  to the additions which they continually received, by the arrival and  settlement of people from beyond the sea.    Another cause of a pompous and artificial mode of life, among those who  could afford it, was, that the example was set by the royal governors.  Under the old charter, the governors were the representatives of the  people, and therefore their way of living had probably been marked by a  popular simplicity. But now, as they represented the person of the king,  they thought it necessary to preserve the dignity of their station, by the  practice of high and gorgeous ceremonials. And, besides, the profitable  offices under the government were filled by men who had lived in London,  and had there contracted fashionable and luxurious habits of living, which  they would not now lay aside. The wealthy people of the province imitated  them; and thus began a general change in social life.    \"So, my dear Clara,\" said Grandfather, \"after our chair had entered the  Province House, it must often have been present at balls and festivals,  though I cannot give you a description of any particular one. But I doubt  not that they were very magnificent; and slaves in gorgeous liveries  waited on the guests, and offered them wine in goblets of massive silver.\"    \"Were there slaves in those days?\" exclaimed Clara.    \"Yes; black slaves and white,\" replied Grandfather. \"Our ancestors not  only bought negroes from Africa, but Indians from South America, and white  people from Ireland. These last were sold, not for life, but for a certain  number of years, in order to pay the expenses of their voyage across the  Atlantic. Nothing was more common than to see a lot of likely Irish girls,  advertised for sale in the newspapers. As for the little negro babies,  they were offered to be given away, like young kittens.\"    \"Perhaps Alice would have liked one to play with, instead of her doll,\"  said Charley, laughing.    But little Alice clasped the waxen doll closer to her bosom.    \"Now, as for this pretty doll, my little Alice,\" said Grandfather, \"I wish  you could have seen what splendid dresses the ladies wore in those times.  They had silks, and satins, and damasks, and brocades, and high  head-dresses, and all sorts of fine things. And they used to wear  hooped-petticoats, of such enormous size that it was quite a journey to  walk round them.\"    \"And how did the gentlemen dress?\" asked Charley.    \"With full as much magnificence as the ladies,\" answered Grandfather. \"For  their holiday suits, they had coats of figured velvet, crimson, green,  blue, and all other gay colors, embroidered with gold or silver lace.  Their waistcoats, which were five times as large as modern ones, were very  splendid. Sometimes, the whole waistcoat, which came down almost to the  knees, was made of gold brocade.\"    \"Why, the wearer must have shone like a golden image!\" said Clara.    \"And, then,\" continued Grandfather, \"they wore various sorts of periwigs,  such as the Tie, the Spencer, the Brigadier, the Major, the Albemarle, the  Ramilies, the Feather-top, and the Full-bottom! Their three-cornered hats  were laced with gold or silver. They had shining buckles at the knees of  their small clothes, and buckles likewise in their shoes. They wore  swords, with beautiful hilts, either of silver, or sometimes of polished  steel, inlaid with gold.\"    \"Oh, I should like to wear a sword!\" cried Charley.    \"And an embroidered crimson velvet coat,\" said Clara, laughing, \"and a  gold brocade waistcoat down to your knees!\"    \"And knee-buckles and shoe-buckles,\" said Laurence, laughing also.    \"And a periwig,\" added little Alice, soberly, not knowing what was the  article of dress, which she recommended to our friend Charley.    Grandfather smiled at the idea of Charley's sturdy little figure in such a  grotesque caparison. He then went on with the history of the chair, and  told the children, that, in 1730, King George the Second appointed  Jonathan Belcher to be governor of Massachusetts, in place of the deceased  Governor Burnet. Mr. Belcher was a native of the province, but had spent  much of his life in Europe.    The new governor found Grandfather's chair in the Province House, he was  struck with its noble and stately aspect, but was of opinion, that age and  hard services had made it scarcely so fit for courtly company, as when it  stood in the Earl of Lincoln's hall. Wherefore, as Governor Belcher was  fond of splendor, he employed a skilful artist to beautify the chair. This  was done by polishing and varnishing it, and by gilding the carved work of  the elbows, and likewise the oaken flowers of the back. The lion's head  now shone like a veritable lump of gold. Finally, Governor Belcher gave  the chair a cushion of blue damask, with a rich golden fringe.    \"Our good old chair being thus glorified,\" proceeded Grandfather, \"it  glittered with a great deal more splendor than it had exhibited just a  century before, when the Lady Arbella brought it over from England. Most  people mistook it for a chair of the latest London fashion. And this may  serve for an example, that there is almost always an old and time-worn  substance under all the glittering show of new invention.\"    \"Grandfather, I cannot see any of the gilding,\" remarked Charley, who had  been examining the chair very minutely.    \"You will not wonder that it has been rubbed off,\" replied Grandfather,  \"when you hear all the adventures that have since befallen the chair.  Gilded it was; and the handsomest room in the Province House was adorned  by it.\"    There was not much to interest the children, in what happened during the  years that Governor Belcher remained in the chair. At first, like Colonel  Shute and Governor Burnet, he was engaged in disputing with the  legislature about his salary. But, as he found it impossible to get a  fixed sum, he finally obtained the king's leave to accept whatever the  legislature chose to give him. And thus the people triumphed, after this  long contest"]]]
