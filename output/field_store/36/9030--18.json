I'll hold your horse if you want to  try it--some of the secrets of the humor of cattle might be revealed  to you.\"    The banter, though given in jest, was too much for this member of a  craft that can always be depended on to do foolish things; and when we  rejoined the outfit, Strayhorn presented a sight no sane man save a  member of our tribe ever would have conceived of.    The herd had scattered over several thousand acres after leaving the  river, grazing freely, and so remained during the rest of the evening.  Forrest changed horses and set out down the river to find the wagon  and pilot it in, for with the long distance that McCann had to cover,  it was a question if he would reach us before dark. Flood selected a  bed ground and camp about a mile out from the river, and those of the  outfit not on herd dragged up an abundance of wood for the night, and  built a roaring fire as a beacon to our absent commissary. Darkness  soon settled over camp, and the prospect of a supperless night was  confronting us; the first guard had taken the herd, and yet there was  no sign of the wagon. Several of us youngsters then mounted our night  horses and rode down the river a mile or over in the hope of meeting  McCann. We came to a steep bank, caused by the shifting of the first  bottom of the river across to the north bank, rode up this bluff some  little distance, dismounted, and fired several shots; then with our  ears to the earth patiently awaited a response. It did not come, and  we rode back again. \"Hell's fire and little fishes!\" said Joe  Stallings, as we clambered into our saddles to return, \"it's not  supper or breakfast that's troubling me, but will we get any dinner  to-morrow? That's a more pregnant question.\"    It must have been after midnight when I was awakened by the braying of  mules and the rattle of the wagon, to hear the voices of Forrest and  McCann, mingled with the rattle of chains as they unharnessed,  condemning to eternal perdition the broken country on the north side  of the Brazos, between Round Timber ferry and the mouth of Monday  Creek.    \"I think that when the Almighty made this country on the north side of  the Brazos,\" said McCann the next morning at breakfast, \"the Creator  must have grown careless or else made it out of odds and ends. There's  just a hundred and one of these dry arroyos that you can't see until  you are right onto them. They wouldn't bother a man on horseback, but  with a loaded wagon it's different. And I'll promise you all right now  that if Forrest hadn't come out and piloted me in, you might have  tightened up your belts for breakfast and drank out of cow tracks and  smoked cigarettes for nourishment. Well, it'll do you good; this high  living was liable to spoil some of you, but I notice that you are all  on your feed this morning. The black strap? Honeyman, get that  molasses jug out of the wagon--it sits right in front of the chuck  box. It does me good to see this outfit's tastes once more going back  to the good old staples of life.\"    We made our usual early start, keeping well out from the river on a  course almost due northward. The next river on our way was the  Wichita, still several days' drive from the mouth of Monday Creek.  Flood's intention was to parallel the old trail until near the river,  when, if its stage of water was not fordable, we would again seek a  lower crossing in the hope of avoiding any waterbound herds on that  watercourse. The second day out from the Brazos it rained heavily  during the day and drizzled during the entire night. Not a hoof would  bed down, requiring the guards to be doubled into two watches for the  night. The next morning, as was usual when off the trail, Flood  scouted in advance, and near the middle of the afternoon's drive we  came into the old trail. The weather in the mean time had faired off,  which revived life and spirit in the outfit, for in trail work there  is nothing that depresses the spirits of men like falling weather. On  coming into the trail, we noticed that no herds had passed since the  rain began. Shortly afterward our rear guard was overtaken by a  horseman who belonged to a mixed herd which was encamped some four or  five miles below the point where we came into the old trail. He  reported the Wichita as having been unfordable for the past week, but  at that time falling; and said that if the rain of the past few days  had not extended as far west as the Staked Plains, the river would be  fordable in a day or two.    Before the stranger left us, Flood returned and confirmed this  information, and reported further that there were two herds lying over  at the Wichita ford expecting to cross the following day. With this  outlook, we grazed our herd up to within five miles of the river and  camped for the night, and our visitor returned to his outfit with  Flood's report of our expectation of crossing on the morrow. But with  the fair weather and the prospects of an easy night, we encamped  entirely too close to the trail, as we experienced to our sorrow. The  grazing was good everywhere, the recent rains having washed away the  dust, and we should have camped farther away. We were all sleepy that  night, and no sooner was supper over than every mother's son of us was  in his blankets. We slept so soundly that the guards were compelled to  dismount when calling the relief, and shake the next guards on duty  out of their slumber and see that they got up, for men would  unconsciously answer in their sleep. The cattle were likewise tired,  and slept as willingly as the men.    About midnight, however, Fox Quarternight dashed into camp, firing his  six-shooter and yelling like a demon. We tumbled out of our blankets  in a dazed condition to hear that one of the herds camped near the  river had stampeded, the heavy rumbling of the running herd and the  shooting of their outfit now being distinctly audible. We lost no time  getting our horses, and in less than a minute were riding for our  cattle, which had already got up and were timidly listening to the  approaching noise. Although we were a good quarter mile from the  trail, before we could drift our herd to a point of safety, the  stampeding cattle swept down the trail like a cyclone and our herd was  absorbed into the maelstrom of the onrush like leaves in a whirlwind.  It was then that our long-legged Mexican steers set us a pace that  required a good horse to equal, for they easily took the lead, the  other herd having run between three and four miles before striking us,  and being already well winded. The other herd were Central Texas  cattle, and numbered over thirty-five hundred, but in running capacity  were never any match for ours.    Before they had run a mile past our camp, our outfit, bunched well  together on the left point, made the first effort to throw them out  and off the trail, and try to turn them. But the waves of an angry  ocean could as easily have been brought under subjection as our  terrorized herd during this first mad dash. Once we turned a few  hundred of the leaders, and about the time we thought success was in  reach, another contingent of double the number had taken the lead;  then we had to abandon what few we had, and again ride to the front.  When we reached the lead, there, within half a mile ahead, burned the  camp-fire of the herd of mixed cattle which had moved up the trail  that evening. They had had ample warning of impending trouble, just as  we had; and before the running cattle reached them about half a dozen  of their outfit rode to our assistance, when we made another effort to  turn or hold the herds from mixing. None of the outfit of the first  herd had kept in the lead with us, their horses fagging, and when the  foreman of this mixed herd met us, not knowing that we were as  innocent of the trouble as himself, he made some slighting remarks  about our outfit and cattle. But it was no time to be sensitive, and  with his outfit to help we threw our whole weight against the left  point a second time, but only turned a few hundred; and before we  could get into the lead again their campfire had been passed and their  herd of over three thousand cattle more were in the run. As cows and  calves predominated in this mixed herd, our own southerners were still  leaders in the stampede.    It is questionable if we would have turned this stampede before  daybreak, had not the nature of the country come to our assistance.  Something over two miles below the camp of the last herd was a deep  creek, the banks of which were steep and the passages few and narrow.  Here we succeeded in turning the leaders, and about half the outfit of  the mixed herd remained, guarding the crossing and turning the lagging  cattle in the run as they came up. With the leaders once turned and no  chance for the others to take a new lead, we had the entire run of  cattle turned back within an hour and safely under control. The first  outfit joined us during the interim, and when day broke we had over  forty men drifting about ten thousand cattle back up the trail. The  different outfits were unfortunately at loggerheads, no one being  willing to assume any blame. Flood hunted up the foreman of the mixed  herd and demanded an apology for his remarks on our abrupt meeting  with him the night before; and while it was granted, it was plain that  it was begrudged. The first herd disclaimed all responsibility,  holding that the stampede was due to an unavoidable accident, their  cattle having grown restless during their enforced lay-over. The  indifferent attitude of their foreman, whose name was Wilson, won the  friendly regard of our outfit, and before the wagon of the mixed  cattle was reached, there was a compact, at least tacit, between their  outfit and ours. Our foreman was not blameless, for had we taken the  usual precaution and camped at least a mile off the trail, which was  our custom "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#16)"],[1,"for  his dark errand. Then those great heart-talks of Jesus, in the upper room,  along the roadway, under the full moon, maybe passing by the massive  temple structure, then under the olive trees. Then the hour grows late,  the disciples are drowsy, the Master is off alone among those trees, then  weird uncertain lights of torches, a rabble of soldiers and priests, a man  using friendship's cloak, and friendship's greeting--then the King is in  the hands of His enemies. An awful night, followed by a yet more awful  day, and the plan of the kingdom is broken by the tragic killing of the  King.        <u>Suffering the Birth-pains of a New Life.</u>      Why did Jesus die? It's a pretty old question. It's been threshed out no  end of times. Yet every time one thinks of the gospel, or opens the Book,  it looks out earnestly into his face. And nothing is better worth while  than to have another serious prayerful go at it. The whole nub of the  gospel is here. It clears the ground greatly not to have any theory about  Jesus' death, but simply to try thoughtfully to gather up all the  statements and group them, regardless of where it may lead, or how it may  knock out previous ideas.    It can be said at once that His dying was not God's own plan. It was a  plan conceived somewhere else, and yielded to by God. God had a plan of  atonement by which men who were willing could be saved from sin and its  effects. That plan is given in the old Hebrew code. To the tabernacle, or  temple, under prescribed regulations, a man could bring some live animal  which he owned. The man brought that which was his own. It represented  him. Through his labor the beast or bird was his. He had transferred some  of his life and strength into it. He identified himself with it further by  close touch at the time of its being offered. He offered up its life. In  his act he acknowledged that his own life was forfeited. In continuing to  live he acknowledged the continued life as belonging to God. He was to  live as belonging to another. He made, in effect, the statement made long  after by Paul: \"I am offering up my life on this altar for my sin;  nevertheless I am living: yet the life I live is no longer mine, but  another's. Mine has been taken away by sin.\" There was no malice or evil  feeling in the man's act, but only penitence, and an earnest, noble  purpose.    The act revealed the man's inner spirit. It acknowledged his sin, that  life is forfeited by sin, his desire to have the sin difficulty  straightened out, and to be at one again with God. He expressed his hatred  of sin and his earnest desire to be free of it. I am not saying at all  that this was true of every Hebrew coming with his sacrifice. I may not  say it of all who approach God to day through Jesus. But clearly enough,  all of this is in the old Hebrew _plan_ devised by God. It was the new  choice that brought the man back to God, even as the first choice had  separated him from God. And the explicit statement made over and over is  this, \"and it shall make atonement.\"    Clearly Jesus' dying does not in any way fit into the old Hebrew _form_ of  sacrifice, nor into the spirit of the man who caused the death of the  sacrifice, though in spirit, in requirement it far more than fills it out.  The Old Testament scheme is Jewish. The manner of Jesus' death is not  Jewish, but Roman. As a priest He was not of the Jewish order, but of an  order non-Jewish and antedating the other by hundreds of years. In no  feature does He fit into the old custom. But every truth taught by the old  is brilliantly exemplified and embodied in Him.    The epistle to the Hebrews was written to Jews who had become Christians,  but through persecution and great suffering were sorely tempted to go back  to the old Jewish faith. They seemed to be saying that Jesus filled out  neither the kingdom plan, nor the Mosaic scheme of sacrifice. The writer  of the epistle is showing with a masterly sweep and detail the immense  superiority of what Jesus did over the old Mosaic plan. Read backward,  these provisions are seen to be vivid illustrations of what Jesus did do,  not in form, not actually, but in fact, in spirit, in a way vastly ahead  of the Hebrew ritual. The truth underneath the old was fully fulfilled in  Jesus, though the form was not.    One needs always to keep sharply in mind the difference between God's  _plan_ and that which He clearly saw ahead, and into which He determined  to fit in carrying out His purpose. There is no clearer, stronger  statement of this than that found in Peter's Pentecost sermon: \"Him being  delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by  the hands of men without law did crucify and slay.\" God knew ahead what  would come. There was a conference held. The whole matter talked over.  With full knowledge of the situation, the obstinate hatred of men, the  terrific suffering involved, it was calmly, resolutely advised and decided  upon that when the time came Jesus should yield Himself up pliantly into  their hands. That is Peter's statement.    This in no way affects the fact that Jesus dying as He did is the one  means of salvation. It does not at all disturb any of Paul's statements,  in their plainest, first-flush meaning. It does explain the kingdom plan,  and the necessity for Jesus finishing up the kingdom plan some day. For  though God's plan may be broken, and retarded, it always is carried  through in the end. It explains too that evil is never necessary to good.  Hatred, evil never helps God's plans. The good that God brought out of the  cross is not through the bad, but in spite of the bad.    The preaching of the Acts is absorbed with the astounding, overshadowing,  appalling fact of the killing of the nation's King. But through it all  runs this strain of reasoning: the kingdom plan has been broken by the  murder of the King. He has been raised from the dead in vindication of His  claim. This marvellous power that is so evident to all eyes and ears is  the Holy Spirit whom the killed King has sent down. It proves that He is  now enthroned in glory at God's right hand. He is coming back to carry out  the kingdom plan. Now the thing to do is to repent, and so there will come  blessing now, and by and by the King again.    When the first church council is held to discuss the matter of letting  non-Jewish outsiders into their circle, the clear-headed,  judicial-tempered James, in the presiding chair, puts the thing straight.  He says: \"Peter has fully told us how God _first_ visited the outside  nations to take out of them a people for Himself. And this fits into the  prophetic plan as outlined by Amos, that _after_ that the kingdom will be  set up and then _all_ men will come.\"    This brings out in bold relief the fact that the _horrible_ features of  Jesus' dying, the hatred and cruelty, were no part of the plan of  salvation, and not necessary to the plan. The cross was the invention of  hate. There is no cross in God's plan of atonement. It is the superlative  degree of hate, brooded and born, and grown lusty in hell. It was God's  master touch that, through yielding, it _becomes_ to all men for all time  the superlative degree of love. The ages have softened all its sharp  jagged edges with a halo of glory.    It is perfectly clear, too, that Jesus died of His own accord. He chose  the _time_ of His death and the _manner_ of it. He had said it was purely  voluntary on His part, and the record plainly shows that it was. All  attempts to kill Him failed until He chose to yield. There are ten  separate mentions of their effort, either to get hold of His person or to  kill Him at once before they finally succeeded. He was killed _in intent_  at least three times, once by being dashed over a precipice, and twice by  stoning, before He was actually killed by crucifixion. Each time  surrounded by a hostile crowd, apparently quite capable of doing as they  pleased, yet each time He passes through their midst, and their hooked  fingers are restrained against their will, and their gnashing teeth bite  only upon the spittle of their hate.    This makes Jesus' _motive_ in yielding explain His death. The cross means  just what His purpose in dying puts into it. If we read the facts of the  gospel stories apart from Jesus' words, the cross spells out just one  word--in large, pot-black capitals--HATE.    What was Jesus' motive or purpose in dying? His own words give the best  answer. The earlier remarks are obscure to those who heard, not  understood. And we can understand that they could not. At the first  Passover He speaks of their destroying \"this temple,\" and His raising it  in three days. Naturally they think of the building of stone, but He is  thinking of His body. To Nicodemus He says that the Son of Man must \"be  _lifted up_\": and to some critics that when the \"bridegroom\" is \"taken  away\" there will be fasting among His followers.    Later, He speaks much more plainly. After John has gone home by way of  Herod's red road, at the time of the feeding of the 5,000 there is the  discussion about bread, and the true bread. Jesus speaks a word that  perplexes the crowd much, and yet He goes on to explain just what He  means. It is in John, sixth chapter, verses fifty-three to fifty-seven  inclusive, He says that if a man eat His flesh and drink His blood he  shall have eternal life. The listening crowd takes the words literally and  of course is perplexed. Clearly enough it is not meant to be taken  literally. Read in the light of the after events it is seen to be an  allusion to His coming death. Such a thing as actually eating His flesh  and drinking His blood would necessitate His death.    We men are under doom of death written in our very bodies, assured to us  by the unchangeable fact of bodily death. Now if a man take Jesus into his  very being so that they become one in effect, then clearly if Jesus die  the man is freed"]]]
