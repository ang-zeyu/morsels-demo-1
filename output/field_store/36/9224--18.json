To perform the pilgrimage to Mecca and Mount  Arafat, with the slaying of victims at Mina, and the worship of the  Kaaba, is an ordinance obligatory (with the condition only that they  have the means) on all believers, who are bound to make the journey even  from the furthest ends of the earth--an ordinance intelligible enough in  a local worship, but unmeaning and impracticable when required of a  world-wide religion. The same may be said of the fast of Ramzan. It is  prescribed in the Koran to be observed by all with undeviating  strictness during the whole day, from earliest dawn till sunset  throughout the month, with specified exemptions for the sick and  penalties for every occasion on which it is broken. The command, imposed  thus with an iron rule on male and female, young and old, operates with  excessive inequality in different seasons, lands, and climates. However  suitable to countries near the equator, where the variations of day and  night are immaterial, the fast becomes intolerable to those who are far  removed either toward the north or the south; and still closer to the  poles, where night merges into day and day into night, impracticable.  Again, with the lunar year (itself an institution divinely imposed), the  month of Ramzan travels in the third of a century from month to month  over the whole cycle of a year. The fast was established at a time when  Ramzan fell in winter, and the change of season was probably not  foreseen by the Prophet. But the result is one which, under some  conditions of time and place, involves the greatest hardship. For when  the fast comes round to summer the trial in a sultry climate, like that  of the burning Indian plains, of passing the whole day without a morsel  of bread or a drop of water becomes to many the occasion of intense  suffering. Such is the effect of the Arabian legislator's attempt at  circumstantial legislation in matters of religious ceremonial.    [Sidenote: Political and social depression owing to relations between  the sexes.]  Nearly the same is the case with all the religions obligations of Islam,  prayer, lustration, etc. But although the minuteness of detail with  which these are enjoined tends toward that jejune and formal worship  which we witness every-where in Moslem lands, still there is nothing in  these observances themselves which (religion apart) should lower the  social condition of Mohammedan populations and prevent their emerging  from that normal state of semi-barbarism and uncivilized depression in  which we find all Moslem peoples. For the cause of this we must look  elsewhere; and it may be recognized, without doubt, in the relations  established by the Koran between the sexes. Polygamy, divorce, servile  concubinage, and the veil are at the root of Moslem decadence.    [Sidenote: Depression of the female sex.  Divorce.]  In respect of married life the condition allotted by the Koran to woman  is that of an inferior dependent creature, destined only for the  service of her master, liable to be cast adrift without the assignment  of a single reason or the notice of a single hour. While the husband  possesses the power of a divorce--absolute, immediate, unquestioned--no  privilege of a corresponding nature has been reserved for the wife. She  hangs on, however unwilling, neglected, or superseded, the perpetual  slave of her lord, if such be his will. When actually divorced she can,  indeed, claim her dower--her _hire_, as it is called in the too plain  language of the Koran; but the knowledge that the wife can make this  claim is at the best a miserable security against capricious taste; and  in the case of bondmaids even that imperfect check is wanting. The power  of divorce is not the only power that may be exercised by the tyrannical  husband. Authority to _confine_ and to _beat_ his wives is distinctly  vested in his discretion.[72] \"Thus restrained, secluded, degraded, the  mere minister of enjoyment, liable at the caprice or passion of the  moment to be turned adrift, it would be hard to say that the position of  a wife was improved by the code of Mohammed.\"[73] Even if the privilege  of divorce and marital tyranny be not exercised, the knowledge of its  existence as a potential right must tend to abate the self-respect, and  in like degree to weaken the influence of the sex, impairing thus the  ameliorating and civilizing power which she was meant to exercise upon  mankind. And the evil has been stereotyped by the Koran for all time.    [Sidenote: Principal Fairbairn on home-life under Islam.]  I must quote one more passage from Principal Fairbairn on the lowering  influence of Moslem domestic life:         The God of Mohammed ... \"spares the sins the Arab loves. A religion       that does not purify the home cannot regenerate the race; one that       depraves the home is certain to deprave humanity. Motherhood is to       be sacred if manhood is to be honorable. Spoil the wife of sanctity       and for the man the sanctities of life have perished. And so it has       been with Islam. It has reformed and lifted savage tribes; it has       depraved and barbarized civilized nations. At the root of its       fairest culture a worm has ever lived that has caused its blossoms       soon to wither and die. Were Mohammed the hope of man, then his       state were hopeless; before him could only be retrogression,       tyranny, and despair.\"[74]    [Sidenote: Demoralizing influence of servile concubinage.]  Still worse is the influence of servile concubinage. The following is  the evidence of a shrewd and able observer in the East:         All zenana life must be bad for men at all stages of their       existence.... In youth it must be ruin to be petted and spoiled by       a company of submissive slave-girls. In manhood it is no less an       evil that when a man enters into private life his affections should       be put up to auction among foolish, fond competitors full of       mutual jealousies and slanders. We are not left entirely to       conjecture as to the effect of female influence on home-life when       it is exerted under these unenlightened and demoralizing       conditions. That is plainly an element _lying at the root of all       the most important features that differentiate progress from       stagnation_.[75]    [Sidenote: Deteriorating influence of relations established between the  sexes.]  Such are the institutions which gnaw at the root of Islam and prevent  the growth of freedom and civilization. \"By these the unity of the  household is fatally broken and the purity and virtue of the family tie  weakened; the vigor of the dominant classes is sapped; the body politic  becomes weak and languid, excepting for intrigues, and the throne itself  liable to fall a prey to a doubtful or contested  succession\"[76]--contested by the progeny of the various rivals crowded  into the royal harem. From the palace downward polygamy and servile  concubinage lower the moral tone, loosen the ties of domestic life, and  hopelessly depress the people.    [Sidenote: The veil.]  Nor is the veil, albeit under the circumstances a necessary precaution,  less detrimental, though in a different way, to the interests of Moslem  society. This strange custom owes its origin to the Prophet's jealous  temperament. It is forbidden in the Koran for women to appear unveiled  before any member of the other sex with the exception of certain near  relatives of specified propinquity.[77] And this law, coupled with other  restrictions of the kind, has led to the imposition of the _boorka_ or  _purdah_ (the dress which conceals the person and the veil) and to the  greater or less seclusion of the harem and zenana.    [Sidenote: Society vitiated by the withdrawal of the female sex.  Mohammedan society, thus truncated, incapable of progress.  The defects of Mohammedan society.]  This ordinance and the practices flowing from it must survive, more or  less, so long as the Koran remains the rule of faith. It may appear at  first sight a mere negative evil, a social custom comparatively  harmless; but in truth it has a more debilitating effect upon the Moslem  race perhaps than any thing else, for by it _woman is totally withdrawn  from her proper place in the social circle_. She may, indeed, in the  comparatively laxer license of some lands be seen flitting along the  streets or driving in her carriage; but even so it is like one belonging  to another world, veiled, shrouded, and cut off from intercourse with  those around her. Free only in the retirement of her own secluded  apartments, she is altogether shut out from her legitimate sphere in the  duties and enjoyments of life. But the blight on the sex itself from  this unnatural regulation, sad as it is, must be regarded as a minor  evil. The mischief extends beyond her. The tone and framework of society  as it came from the Maker's hands are altered, damaged, and  deteriorated. From the veil there flows this double injury. The bright,  refining, softening influence of woman is withdrawn from the outer  world, and social life, wanting the gracious influences of the female  sex, becomes, as we see throughout Moslem lands, forced, hard,  unnatural, and morose. Moreover, the Mohammedan nations, for all  purposes of common elevation and for all efforts of philanthropy and  liberty, are (as they live in public and beyond the inner recesses of  their homes) but a truncated and imperfect exhibition of humanity. They  are wanting in one of its constituent parts, the better half, the  humanizing and the softening element. And it would be against the nature  of things to suppose that the body, thus shorn and mutilated, can  possess in itself the virtue and power of progress, reform, and  elevation. The link connecting the family with social and public life is  detached, and so neither is _en rapport_, as it should be, with the  other.

Eesa Meean entered  the school-room, and approached the children with the usual courtesy  and compliments, followed by six armed men, and one table attendant,  or khidmutgar.    The two boys were sitting beside each other, the eldest, Aga Allee,  on the left, and the youngest, Nizam-od Dowla, on the right. Eesa  Meean sat down on the left side of the eldest, and congratulated both  on the rapid progress they were making in their studies. Three of his  followers, while he was doing this, placed themselves on the left of  the eldest, and the other three on the right of the youngest. On a  concerted signal all drew forth and cocked their pistols, and placed  themselves at the only three doors that opened from the school-room,  two at each, while at a signal made by the khidmutgar, eight more men  came in armed in the same manner. Two of them with naked daggers in  their right hands seized the two boys with their left, and threatened  them with instant death if they attempted to more or call for help.  The other six threatened to kill any one who should attempt to force  his way into the apartment. The khidmutgar, in the mean time, seized  and brought into the room two large gharahs or pitchers of drinking  water, that stood outside, as the weather was very hot, and the party  would require it They were afraid that poison might be put into the  water if left outside after they had commenced the assault. Eesa  Meean then declared, that he had been driven to this violent act by  the detention of his girl by the Khasmahal, and must have her  instantly surrendered, or they would put the boys to death. Hearing  the noise from his bathing-room, their tutor, Karamut Allee, rushed  into the room with nothing on his person but his waist-band, and  began to admonish the ruffians. Seeing him unarmed, and respecting  his peaceful character, they let him pass in and vociferate, but paid  no regard to what he said.    The alarm had spread through the house and town, and many of the  chief officers of the Court were permitted to enter the room unarmed.  Roshun-od Dowlah, Sobhan Allee Khan, Fakeer Mahomed Khan, Nuzee Allee  Khan, (the Khasmahul's son-in-law,) and others of equal rank, all in  loud terms admonished the assailants, and demanded the surrender of  the children, but all were alike unheeded. The chief merchant of  Lucknow, Sa Gobind Lal, came in; and thinking that all affairs could  and ought to be settled in a business-like way, told the chief  officers to fix the sum to be given, and he would at once pledge  himself to the payment. All agreed to this, and Sobhan Allee Khan,  the Chief Secretary of the minister, set to work and drew up a long  and eloquent paper of conditions. On his beginning to read it, one of  the ruffians, who had one eye, rushed in, snatched it from his hand,  tore it to pieces, and threw the fragments into his chief's, Eesa  Meean's, face, saying, \"that this fellow would write them all out of  their lives, as he was writing the people of Oude every day out of  their properties; that if they must die, it should not be by pen and  paper, but by swords and daggers in a fair fight; that all their  lives had been staked, and all should die or live together.\" He was  overpowered by the others, and other papers were drawn up by the  ready writer and consummate knave Sobhan Allee, but the one-eyed man  contrived to get hold of all, one after the other, and tear them up.    The minister was with the King when he first heard of the affair, and  he went off forthwith to the Resident, Mr. Ricketts, to say, that his  Majesty had in vain endeavoured to rescue the boys through his  principal civil officers, and had sent all his available troops, but  in vain; and now earnestly entreated the British Resident to  interpose and save their lives. The Resident consented to do so, on  condition that any arrangement he might find it necessary to make  should be binding on his Majesty and the minister. Aga Meer returned  to the King with this message, and his Majesty agreed to this  condition. The Resident then sent his head moonshie, Gholam Hossein,  to promise Eesa Meean, that the woman should be restored to him, and  any grievance he might have to complain of should be redressed, and  his party all saved, if he gave up the children. But he and his  followers now demanded a large sum of money, and declared, that they  would murder the boys unless it was given and secured to them, with a  pledge for personal security to the whole party.    The minister, on hearing this, came to the Resident, and implored him  to adopt some measures to save the lives of the children. The  Resident had been for three weeks confined to his couch from illness,  but he sent his Assistant, Captain Lockett, with full powers to make  any arrangement, and pledge himself to any engagements, which might  appear to him to be necessary, to save the lives of the boys. He  went, and being unarmed, was permitted to enter the room. He asked  for Eesa Meean, whom he had never before seen, when one of the party  that knelt over the boys rose, and saluting him, said, \"I am Eesa  Meean.\" Captain Lockett told him that he wanted to speak to him in  private, when Eesa Meean pointed to a door leading into a side room,  into which they retired. Eesa Meean offered Captain Lockett a chair,  and at his request sat down by his side. He then entered into a long  story of grievances, which Captain Lockett considered to be  frivolous, and said, \"that the minister had injured his prospects in  many ways, and at last disgraced him in the eyes of all people at  Lucknow, by conniving at the elopement of the dancing-girl that he  was a soldier and regardless of life under such disgrace, and  prepared to abide by the result of his present attempt to secure  redress, whatever it might be; that his terms were the payment down  of five lacs of rupees, the restoration of his dancing-girl, and the  security of his own person and property, with permission to go where  he pleased, unmolested.\" Captain Lockett reminded him quietly of what  he had just said: \"that he was a soldier, and anxious only for the  recovery of his lost honour; that now, to demand, money, was to show  to the world that wounded honour was urged as a mere pretext, and the  seizure of the boys a means adopted for the sole purpose of extorting  money; that he could not condescend to hold further converse with him  if he persisted in such preposterous demands; that he might murder  the children as they seemed to be in his power, but if he did so, he  and his party would be all instantly put to death, as the house was  surrounded by thousands of the King's soldiers, ready to fall upon  them at the slightest signal.\" He then recommended him to release the  boys forthwith before the excitement without became more strong, and  accompany him to the Residency, where his real Wrongs would be  inquired into and redressed.    Eesa Meean then rose and said: \"Money is not my object. I despise it.  I regard nothing but the preservation of my honour, and agree to what  you propose; but I have several companions here who require to be  consulted: let me speak to them.\" He then went into the large room.  His companions all made objections of one kind or another, and what  they all agreed to one moment was rejected the next. They vociferated  loudly, and disputed violently with each other, and with all around  them, and at times appeared desperate and determined to sacrifice the  boys, and sell their own lives as dearly as possible. Eesa Meean  himself seemed to be the most violent and boisterous of all, and had  his hand frequently on the hilt of his sword when he disputed with  the King's officers, whom he abused in the grossest possible terms.  They did more harm than good by their want of temper and patience,  but above all by their utter want of character, since no one could  place the slightest reliance on the word of any one of them in such a  trying moment. They seemed to have no control over their feelings,  and to think that they could do all that was required by harsh  language and loud bawling.    Captain Lockett at last persuaded them to leave the whole affair in  his hands; and had they done so at first, he would have settled the  matter, he thought, in half the time. They had been discussing  matters in this angry manner for four hours and a half, without  making the slightest impression on the ruffians; but when all became  silent, Captain Lockett prevailed on them to release the boys on the  conditions agreed to between him and Eesa Meean, and recorded on  paper. In this paper it was declared--\"That Syud Mahomed Eesa Khan,  together with the woman, Beeba Jan, shall be allowed to go where he  liked, with security to his life and honour, and with all the  property and effects he might have, whether he got it from the King  of Oude or from his minister; and that no one, either in the  Honourable Company's or in the King of Oude's dominions, shall offer  him any molestation; that no obstruction shall be thrown in his way  by the officers of the British Government in the countries of any of  the Rajahs at whose courts there may be a British Resident; and  further, that no molestation shall be offered to him in the British  territories in consequence of the disturbance which took place at  Bareilly in 1816.    \"(Signed)    A. LOCKETT, _Assistant Resident_.\"    After this paper had been signed by Captain Lockett, the two boys  were set at liberty, and sent off in palanqeens to their mother under  a guard. The minister had, in the morning, promised to give the  assailants twenty thousand rupees, and they arrived before the  discussions closed, and were placed on the floor of the school-room.  The girl, Beeba Jan, was now brought into the room, and made over to  Eesa Meean. When first brought before him, she thought she was to be  sacrificed to save"]]]
