Even as He hath said: \"O men! Ye are but paupers in need of  God; but God is the Rich, the Self-Sufficing.\"(95) By 'riches' therefore  is meant independence of all else but God, and by 'poverty' the lack of  things that are of God.    Similarly, call thou to mind the day when the Jews, who had surrounded  Jesus, Son of Mary, were pressing Him to confess His claim of being the  Messiah and Prophet of God, so that they might declare Him an infidel and  sentence Him to death. Then, they led Him away, He Who was the Day-star of  the heaven of divine Revelation, unto Pilate and Caiaphas, who was the  leading divine of that age. The chief priests were all assembled in the  palace, also a multitude of people who had gathered to witness His  sufferings, to deride and injure Him. Though they repeatedly questioned  Him, hoping that He would confess His claim, yet Jesus held His peace and  spake not. Finally, an accursed of God arose and, approaching Jesus,  adjured Him saying: \"Didst thou not claim to be the Divine Messiah? Didst  thou not say, 'I am the King of Kings, My word is the Word of God, and I  am the breaker of the Sabbath day?'\" Thereupon Jesus lifted up His head  and said: \"Beholdest thou not the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of  power and might?\" These were His words, and yet consider how to outward  seeming He was devoid of all power except that inner power which was of  God and which had encompassed all that is in heaven and on earth. How can  I relate all that befell Him after He spoke these words? How shall I  describe their heinous behaviour towards Him? They at last heaped on His  blessed Person such woes that He took His flight unto the fourth Heaven.    It is also recorded in the Gospel according to St. Luke, that on a certain  day Jesus passed by a Jew who was sick of the palsy, and lay upon a couch.  When the Jew saw Him, he recognized Him, and cried out for His help. Jesus  said unto him: \"Arise from thy bed; thy sins are forgiven thee.\" Certain  of the Jews, standing by, protested saying: \"Who can forgive sins, but God  alone?\" And immediately He perceived their thoughts, Jesus answering said  unto them: \"Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, arise,  and take up thy bed, and walk; or to say, thy sins are forgiven thee? that  ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins.\"(96)  This is the real sovereignty, and such is the power of God's chosen Ones!  All these things which We have repeatedly mentioned, and the details which  We have cited from divers sources, have no other purpose but to enable  thee to grasp the meaning of the allusions in the utterances of the chosen  Ones of God, lest certain of these utterances cause thy feet to falter and  thy heart to be dismayed.    Thus with steadfast steps we may tread the Path of certitude, that  perchance the breeze that bloweth from the meads of the good-pleasure of  God may waft upon us the sweet savours of divine acceptance, and cause us,  vanishing mortals that we are, to attain unto the Kingdom of everlasting  glory. Then wilt thou comprehend the inner meaning of sovereignty and the  like, spoken of in the traditions and scriptures. Furthermore, it is  already evident and known unto thee that those things to which the Jews  and the Christians have clung, and the cavilings which they heaped upon  the Beauty of Muhammad, the same have in this day been upheld by the  people of the Qur'an, and been witnessed in their denunciations of the  \"Point of the Bayan\"--may the souls of all that dwell within the kingdom of  divine Revelations be a sacrifice unto Him! Behold their folly: they utter  the self-same words, uttered by the Jews of old, and know it not! How well  and true are His words concerning them: \"Leave them to entertain  themselves with their cavilings!\"(97) \"As Thou livest, O Muhammad! they  are seized by the frenzy of their vain fancies.\"(98)    When the Unseen, the Eternal, the divine Essence, caused the Day-star of  Muhammad to rise above the horizon of knowledge, among the cavils which  the Jewish divines raised against Him was that after Moses no Prophet  should be sent of God. Yea, mention hath been made in the scriptures of a  Soul Who must needs be made manifest and Who will advance the Faith, and  promote the interests of the people, of Moses, so that the Law of the  Mosaic Dispensation may encompass the whole earth. Thus hath the King of  eternal glory referred in His Book to the words uttered by those wanderers  in the vale of remoteness and error: \"'The hand of God,' say the Jews, 'is  chained up.' Chained up be their own hands! And for that which they have  said, they were accursed. Nay, outstretched are both His hands!\"(99) \"The  hand of God is above their hands.\"(100)    Although the commentators of the Qur'an have related in divers manners the  circumstances attending the revelation of this verse, yet thou shouldst  endeavour to apprehend the purpose thereof. He saith: How false is that  which the Jews have imagined! How can the hand of Him Who is the King in  truth, Who caused the countenance of Moses to be made manifest, and  conferred upon Him the robe of Prophethood--how can the hand of such a One  be chained and fettered? How can He be conceived as powerless to raise up  yet another Messenger after Moses? Behold the absurdity of their saying;  how far it hath strayed from the path of knowledge and understanding!  Observe how in this day also, all these people have occupied themselves  with such foolish absurdities. For over a thousand years they have been  reciting this verse, and unwittingly pronouncing their censure against the  Jews, utterly unaware that they themselves, openly and privily, are  voicing the sentiments and belief of the Jewish people! Thou art surely  aware of their idle contention, that all Revelation is ended, that the  portals of Divine mercy are closed, that from the day-springs of eternal  holiness no sun shall rise again, that the Ocean of everlasting bounty is  forever stilled, and that out of the Tabernacle of ancient glory the  Messengers of God have ceased to be made manifest. Such is the measure of  the understanding of these small-minded, contemptible people. These people  have imagined that the flow of God's all-encompassing grace and plenteous  mercies, the cessation of which no mind can contemplate, has been halted.  From every side they have risen and girded up the loins of tyranny, and  exerted the utmost endeavour to quench with the bitter waters of their  vain fancy the flame of God's burning Bush, oblivious that the globe of  power shall within its own mighty stronghold protect the Lamp of God. The  utter destitution into which this people have fallen doth surely suffice  them, inasmuch as they have been deprived of the recognition of the  essential Purpose and the knowledge of the Mystery and Substance of the  Cause of God. For the highest and most excelling grace bestowed upon men  is the grace of \"attaining unto the Presence of God\" and of His  recognition, which has been promised unto all people. This is the utmost  degree of grace vouchsafed unto man by the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of  Days, and the fulness of His absolute bounty upon His creatures. Of this  grace and bounty none of this people hath partaken, neither have they been  honoured with this most exalted distinction. How numerous are those  revealed verses which explicitly bear witness unto this most weighty truth  and exalted Theme! And yet they have rejected it, and, after their own  desire, misconstrued its meaning. Even as He hath revealed: \"As for those  who believe not in the signs of God, or that they shall ever meet Him,  these of My mercy shall despair, and for them doth a grievous chastisement  await.\"(101) Also He saith: \"They who bear in mind that they shall attain  unto the Presence of their Lord, and that unto Him shall they  return.\"(102) Also in another instance He saith: \"They who held it as  certain that they must meet God, said, 'How oft, by God's will, hath a  small host vanquished a numerous host!'\"(103) In yet another instance He  revealeth: \"Let him then who hopeth to attain the presence of his Lord  work a righteous work.\"(104) And also He saith: \"He ordereth all things.  He maketh His signs clear, that ye may have firm faith in attaining the  presence of your Lord.\"(105)    This people have repudiated all these verses, that unmistakably testify to  the reality of \"attainment unto the Divine Presence.\" No theme hath been  more emphatically asserted in the holy scriptures. Notwithstanding, they  have deprived themselves of this lofty and most exalted rank, this supreme  and glorious station. Some have contended that by \"attainment unto the  Divine Presence\" is meant the \"Revelation\" of God in the Day of  Resurrection. Should they assert that the \"Revelation\" of God signifieth a  \"Universal Revelation,\" it is clear and evident that such revelation  already existeth in all things. The truth of this We have already  established, inasmuch as We have demonstrated that all things are the  recipients and revealers of the splendours of that ideal King, and that  the signs of the revelation of that Sun, the Source of all splendour,  exist and are manifest in the mirrors of beings. Nay, were man to gaze  with the eye of divine and spiritual discernment, he will readily  recognize that nothing whatsoever can exist without the revelation of the  splendour of God, the ideal King. Consider how all created things  eloquently testify to the revelation of that inner Light within them.

THOU SEEST...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Thou seest me dwelling in this  prison-house that lieth behind the seas and the mountains, and knowest  full well what I have endured for love of Thee and for the sake of Thy  Cause. Thou art He, O my God, Who hath raised me up at Thy behest, and  bidden me to occupy Thy seat, and to summon all men to the court of Thy  mercy. It is Thou Who hast commanded me to tell out the things Thou didst  destine for them in the Tablet of Thy decree and didst inscribe with the  pen of Thy Revelation, and Who hast enjoined on me the duty of kindling  the fire of Thy love in the hearts of Thy servants, and of drawing all the  peoples of the earth nearer to the habitation of Thy throne.    And when, as bidden by Thee, I arose and called out, by Thy leave, all Thy  creatures, the wayward among Thy servants opposed me. Some turned away  from me, others disowned my claim, a few hesitated, while others were sore  perplexed, notwithstanding that Thy testimony was set forth before the  followers of all religions, and Thy proof demonstrated unto all the  peoples of the earth, and the signs of Thy might so powerfully manifested  as to encompass the entire creation.    I was, moreover, opposed by mine own kindred, although, as Thou knowest,  they were dear to me and I had desired for them that which I had desired  for mine own self. These are the ones who, when learning that I had been  cast into prison, perpetrated against me what no man else on earth had  perpetrated.    I entreat Thee, therefore, O my God, by Thy name by which Thou hast  separated between truth and denial, to purify their hearts of all evil  suggestions, and to enable them to draw nigh unto Him Who is the  Day-Spring of Thy names and Thine attributes.    Thou knowest, O my God, that I have severed every tie that bindeth me to  any of Thy creatures except that most exalted tie that uniteth me with  whosoever cleaveth unto Thee, in this the day of the revelation of Thy  most august Self, that hath appeared in Thy name, the All-Glorious. Thou  knowest that I have dissolved every bond that knitteth me to any one of my  kindred except such as have enjoyed near access to Thy most effulgent  face.    I have no will but Thy will, O my Lord, and cherish no desire except Thy  desire. From my pen floweth only the summons which Thine own exalted pen  hath voiced, and my tongue uttereth naught save what the Most Great Spirit  hath itself proclaimed in the kingdom of Thine eternity. I am stirred by  nothing else except the winds of Thy will, and breathe no word except the  words which, by Thy leave and Thine inspiration, I am led to pronounce.    Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Well-Beloved of all that have known  Thee, and the Desire of the hearts of such as are devoted to Thee,  inasmuch as Thou hast made me a target for the ills that I suffer in my  love for Thee, and the object of the assaults launched against me in Thy  path. Thy glory beareth me witness! I can, on no account, feel impatient  of the adversities that I have borne in my love for Thee. From the very  day Thou didst reveal Thyself unto me, I have accepted for myself every  manner of tribulation. Every moment of my life my head crieth out to Thee  and saith: \"Would, O my Lord, that I could be raised on the spear-point in  Thy path!\" while my blood entreateth Thee saying: \"Dye the earth with me,  O my God, for the sake of Thy love and Thy pleasure!\" Thou knowest that I  have, at no time, sought to guard my body against any affliction, nay  rather I have continually anticipated the things Thou didst ordain for me  in the Tablet of Thy decree.    Behold, then, O my God, my loneliness among Thy servants and my remoteness  from Thy friends and Thy chosen ones. I beseech Thee, by the showers of  the clouds of Thy mercy, whereby Thou hast caused the blossoms of Thy  praise and utterance and the flowers of Thy wisdom and testimony to spring  forth in the hearts of all them that have recognized Thy oneness, to  supply Thy servants and my kindred with the fruits of the tree of Thy  unity, in these days when Thou hast been established upon the throne of  Thy mercy. Hinder them not, O my Lord, from attaining unto the things Thou  dost possess, and write down for them that which will aid them to scale  the heights of Thy grace and favor. Give them, moreover, to drink of the  living waters of Thy knowledge, and ordain for them the good of this world  and of the world to come.    Thou art, verily, the Lord of Baha, and the Beloved of his heart, and the  Object of his desire, and the Inspirer of his tongue, and the Source of  his soul. No God is there but Thee, the Inaccessible, the Most High. Thou  art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most  Merciful.            LXVII: \"GLORIFIED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I YIELD THEE...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I yield Thee thanks for having enabled  me to recognize the Manifestation of Thyself, and for having severed me  from Thine enemies, and laid bare before mine eyes their misdeeds and  wicked works in Thy days, and for having rid me of all attachment to them,  and caused me to turn wholly towards Thy grace and bountiful favors. I  give Thee thanks, also, for having sent down upon me from the clouds of  Thy will that which hath so sanctified me from the hints of the infidels  and the allusions of the misbelievers that I have fixed my heart firmly on  Thee, and fled from such as have denied the light of Thy countenance.  Again I thank Thee for having empowered me to be steadfast in Thy love,  and to speak forth Thy praise and to extol Thy virtues, and for having  given me to drink of the cup of Thy mercy that hath surpassed all things  visible and invisible.    Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Loving.            LXVIII: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O MY GOD! THOU SEEST ME SHUT UP...\"      Praised be Thou, O my God! Thou seest me shut up in this Prison, and art  well aware that I have entered it solely for Thy sake and for the sake of  the glorification of Thy word and the proclamation of Thy Cause. I cry out  to Thee, this very moment, O Thou Who art the Lord of all worlds,  beseeching Thee, by Thine undoubted Name, to attract the hearts of Thy  servants unto the Day-Spring of Thy most excellent titles and the  Dawning-Place of Thy most resplendent signs.    But for the troubles that touch me in Thy path, O my God, how else could  my heart rejoice in Thy days; and were it not for the blood which is shed  for love of Thee, what else could tinge the faces of Thy chosen ones  before the eyes of Thy creatures? I swear by Thy might! The ornament that  adorneth the countenance of Thy dear ones is the blood which, in their  love for Thee, floweth out of their foreheads over their faces.    Thou beholdest, O my God, how every bone in my body soundeth like a pipe  with the music of Thine inspiration, revealing the signs of Thy oneness  and the clear tokens of Thy unity. I entreat Thee, O my God, by Thy Name  which irradiateth all things, to raise up such servants as shall incline  their ears to the voice of the melodies that hath ascended from the right  hand of the throne of Thy glory. Make them, then, to quaff from the hand  of Thy grace the wine of Thy mercy, that it may assure their hearts, and  cause them to turn away from the left hand of idle fancies and vain  imaginings to the right hand of confidence and certitude.    Now that Thou hast guided them unto the door of Thy grace, O my Lord, cast  them not away, by Thy bounty; and now that Thou hast summoned them unto  the horizon of Thy Cause, keep them not back from Thee, by Thy  graciousness and favor. Powerful art Thou to do as Thou pleasest. No God  is there but Thee, the Omniscient, the All-Informed.            LXIX: \"GLORIFIED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD! MY TONGUE,...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! My tongue, both the tongue of my body  and the tongue of my heart, my limbs and members, every pulsating vein  within me, every hair of my head, all proclaim that Thou art God, and that  there is none other God beside Thee. From everlasting Thou hast been  immeasurably exalted above all similitudes and comparisons, and sanctified  from whatsoever pertaineth to the creation Thou hast created and  fashioned. From eternity Thou hast been alone, with none to share the  majesty of Thy singleness, and hast remained far above the changes and  chances to which all Thy creatures are subjected.    And when Thou didst purpose to demonstrate the power of Thy sovereign  might, and to glorify Thy word, and to guide the steps of Thy people, Thou  didst raise up from among Thy creatures One of Thy servants, Whom Thou  didst send forth with the signs of Thy sovereignty, and Whom Thou didst  endue with the clear tokens of Thy oneness, that He might fulfill Thy  testimony unto all created things, and perfect Thy proof before all men.    As soon as He revealed Himself, as bidden by Thee, and called Thy servants  to turn in the direction of Thy gifts, and to set their faces towards the  horizon of Thy knowledge, the signs of dissension appeared amongst them.  Some responded to Thy call and, without the least hesitation, obeyed Thy  summons. Others turned their backs to Thee, and followed the desires of a  corrupt inclination.    I implore Thee, O my God, by Thy Most Great Name, to enrapture the nations  through the potency of the Word which Thou didst ordain to be the king of  all words, the Word whereby the goodly pearls of Thy hidden wisdom were  uncovered, and the gem-like mysteries which were wrapped up within Thee  were unraveled. Deprive them not, by Thy grace and bounty, of the things  Thou didst desire for them, and suffer them not to be far removed from the  shores of the ocean of Thy presence.
