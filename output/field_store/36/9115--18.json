In the laudation of Varuna the fancy of the poet exhausts itself in  lofty imagery, and reaches the topmost height of Vedic religious  lyric. In the praise of Dawn it descends not lower than to interweave  beauty with dignity of utterance. Nothing in religious poetry more  graceful or delicate than the Vedic Dawn-hymns has ever been written.  In the daily vision of Dawn following her sister Night the poet sees  his fairest goddess, and in his worship of her there is love and  admiration, such as is evoked by the sight of no other deity. \"She  comes like a fair young maiden, awakening all to labor, with an  hundred chariots comes she, and brings the shining light; gleam forth,  O Dawn, and give us thy blessing this day; for in thee is the life of  every living creature. Even as thou hast rewarded the singers of old,  so now reward our song\" (I. 48).    The kine of Dawn are the bright clouds that, like red cattle, wander  in droves upon the horizon. Sometimes the rays of light, which stretch  across the heaven, are intended by this image, for the cattle-herding  poets employed their flocks as figures for various ends.    The inevitable selfish pessimism of unripe reflection is also woven  into the later Dawn-hymns: \"How long will it be ere this Dawn, too,  shall join the Dawns departed? Vanished are now the men that saw the  Dawns of old; we here see her now; there will follow others who will  see her hereafter; but, O Dawn, beam here thy fairest; rich in  blessings, true art thou to friend and right. Bring hither (to the  morning sacrifice) the gods\" (I. 113).    Since the metre (here ignored) of the following hymn is not all of one  model, it is probable that after the fourth verse a new hymn began,  which was distinct from the first; but the argument from metre is  unconvincing, and in any event both songs are worth citing, since they  show how varied were the images and fancies of the poets: \"The Dawns  are like heroes with golden weapons; like red kine of the morning on  the field of heaven; shining they weave their webs of light, like  women active at work; food they bring to the pious worshipper. Like a  dancing girl is the Dawn adorned, and opens freely her bosom; as a cow  gives milk, as a cow comes forth from its stall, so opens she her  breast, so comes she out of the darkness (verses 1-4) ...She is the  ever new, born again and again, adorned always with the same color. As  a player conceals the dice, so keeps she concealed the days of a man;  daughter of Heaven she wakes and drives away her sister (Night). Like  kine, like the waves of a flood, with sunbeams she appears. O rich  Dawn, bring us wealth; harness thy red horses, and bring to us  success\" (I. 92). The homage to Dawn is naturally divided at times  with that to the sun: \"Fair shines the light of morning; the sun  awakens us to toil; along the path of order goes Dawn arrayed in  light. She extendeth herself in the east, and gleameth till she fills  the sky and earth\"; and again: \"Dawn is the great work of Varuna and  Mitra; through the sun is she awakened\" (I. 124; III. 61. 6-7). In the  ritualistic period Dawn is still mechanically lauded, and her beams  \"rise in the east like pillars of sacrifice\" (IV. 51. 2); but  otherwise the imagery of the selections given above is that which is  usually employed. The 'three dawns' occasionally referred to are, as  we have shown elsewhere,[98] the three dawn-lights, white, red, and  yellow, as they are seen by both the Vedic poet and the Florentine.    Dawn becomes common and trite after awhile, as do all the gods, and is  invoked more to give than to please. 'Wake us,' cries a later poet,  'Wake us to wealth, O Dawn; give to us, give to us; wake up, lest the  sun burn thee with his light'--a passage (V. 79) which has caused much  learned nonsense to be written on the inimical relations of Sun and  Dawn as portrayed here. The dull idea is that Dawn is lazy, and had  better get up before S[=u]rya catches her asleep. The poet is not in  the least worried because his image does not express a suitable  relationship between the dawn and the sun, nor need others be  disturbed at it. The hymn is late, and only important in showing the  new carelessness as regards the old gods.[99] Some other traits appear  in VII. 75. 1 ff., where Dawn is 'queen of the world,' and banishes  the _druhs_, or evil spirit. She here is daughter of Heaven, and wife  of the sun (4, 5); _ib_. 76. 1, she is the eye of the world; and _ib_  81. 4, she is invoked as 'mother.'    There is, at times, so close a resemblance between Dawn-hymns and  Sun-hymns that the imagery employed in one is used in the other. Thus  the hymn VI. 64 begins: \"The beams of Dawn have arisen, shining as  shine the waters' gleaming waves. She makes good paths, ... she  banishes darkness as a warrior drives away a foe (so of the sun, IV.  13. 2; X. 37. 4; 170. 2). Beautiful are thy paths upon the mountains,  and across the waters thou shinest, self-gleaming\" (also of the sun).  With the last expression may be compared that in VI. 65. 5: \"Dawn,  whose seat is upon the hills.\"    Dawn is intimately connected not only with Agni but with the Twin  Horsemen, the Acvins (equites)--if not so intimately connected as is  Helen with the Dioskouroi, who, _pace_ Pischel, are the Acvins of  Hellas. This relationship is more emphasized in the hymns to the  latter gods, but occasionally occurs in Dawn-hymns, of which another  is here translated in full.      TO DAWN (IV. 52).      The Daughter of Heaven, this beauteous maid,    Resplendent leaves her sister (Night),    And now before (our sight) appears.      Red glows she like a shining mare,    Mother of kine, who timely comes--    The Horsemen's friend Aurora is.      Both friend art thou of the Horsemen twain,    And mother art thou of the kine,    And thou, Aurora, rulest wealth.      We wake thee with our praise as one    Who foes removes; such thought is ours,    O thou that art possesst of joy.      Thy radiant beams beneficent    Like herds of cattle now appear;    Aurora fills the wide expanse.      With light hast thou the dark removed,    Filling (the world), O brilliant one.    Aurora, help us as thou us'st.      With rays thou stretchest through the heaven    And through the fair wide space between,    O Dawn, with thy refulgent light.    It was seen that Savitar (P[=u]shan) is the rising and setting sun.  So, antithetic to Dawn, stands the Abendroth with her sister, Night.  This last, generally, as in the hymn just translated, is lauded only  in connection with Dawn, and for herself alone gets but one hymn, and  that is not in a family-book. She is to be regarded, therefore, less  as a goddess of the pantheon than as a quasi-goddess, the result of a  poet's meditative imagination, rather than one of the folk's primitive  objects of adoration; somewhat as the English poets personify \"Ye  clouds, that far above me float and pause, ye ocean-waves ... ye  woods, that listen to the night-bird's singing, O ye loud waves, and O  ye forests high, and O ye clouds that far above me soared; thou rising  sun, thou blue rejoicing sky!\"--and as in Greek poetry, that which  before has been conceived of vaguely as divine suddenly is invested  with a divine personality. The later poet exalts these aspects of  nature, and endows those that were before only half recognized with a  little special praise. So, whereas Night was divine at first merely as  the sister of divine Dawn, in the tenth book one poet thus gives her  praise:        HYMN TO NIGHT (X. 127).      Night, shining goddess, comes, who now    Looks out afar with many eyes,    And putteth all her beauties on.      Immortal shining goddess, she    The depths and heights alike hath filled,    And drives with light the dark away.      To me she comes, adorned well,    A darkness black now sightly made;    Pay then thy debt, O Dawn, and go.[100]      The bright one coming put aside    Her sister Dawn (the sunset light),    And lo! the darkness hastes away.      So (kind art thou) to us; at whose    Appearing we retire to rest,    As birds fly homeward to the tree.      To rest are come the throngs of men;    To rest, the beasts; to rest, the birds;    And e'en the greedy eagles rest.      Keep off the she-wolf and the wolf,    Keep off the thief, O billowy Night,    Be thou to us a saviour now.      To thee, O Night, as 'twere an herd,    To a conqueror (brought), bring I an hymn    Daughter of Heaven, accept (the gift).[101]      THE ACVINS.    The Acvins who are, as was said above, the 'Horsemen,' parallel to the  Greek Dioskouroi, are twins, sons of Dyaus, husbands, perhaps brothers  of the Dawn. They have been variously 'interpreted,' yet in point of  fact one knows no more now what was the original conception of the  twain than was known before Occidental scholars began to study  them.[102] Even the ancients made mere guesses: the Acvins came before  the Dawn, and are so-called because they ride on horses _(acva,  equos)_ they represent either Heaven and Earth, or Day and Night, or  Sun and Moon, or two earthly kings--such is the unsatisfactory  information given by the Hindus themselves.[103]    Much the same language with that in the Dawn-hymns is naturally  employed in praising the Twin Brothers. They, like the Dioskouroi, are  said to have been incorporated gradually into the pantheon, on an  equality with the other gods,[104] not because they were at first  human beings, but because they, like Night, were adjuncts of Dawn, and  got their divinity through her as leader.[105] In the last book of the  Rig Veda they are the sons of Sarany[=u] and Vivasvant, but it is not  certain whether Sarany[=u] means dawn or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#16)"],[1,"will  have made more complex pursuits possible. As a rule the objects which  are most prized and which have most educative value are those which  lend themselves best to the actions with which alone the child is  familiar. Hence the supreme importance of the doll and the doll's  perambulator. The doll will be treated exactly as the child is treated  by the nurse. It will be washed, and dressed, and weighed, and put to  bed in faithful reproduction of what the child has daily experienced.  Dusting, and sweeping, and laying the table will be exactly copied. If  a child has no opportunity of being familiar with horses, if he has  not seen them fed, and watered, and groomed, and harnessed, he may not  find any great satisfaction in a toy horse, or pay much attention to  it, no matter how costly or realistic it may be.    In the third year more precise tasks, such as stringing beads,  drawing, and painting, will play their part, while at the same time  the increased imaginative powers will give attraction to toy soldiers  or a toy tea-service. Playing at shop, robbers, and rafts are  developments of still later growth. In the child's games we recognise  the instinct of imitation--playing with dolls, sweeping and dusting,  playing at shop or visitors; the instinct of constructiveness--making  mud pies and sand castles, drawing or whittling a stick; and the  instinct of experiment--letting objects fall, rattling, hammering,  taking to pieces. All this activity must be encouraged, never unduly  repressed or destroyed. But whatever form it takes, the bulk of the  play must be carried on without the intervention of grown-up persons,  or it will lose its educative value and prove too exacting. If  grown-up people attempt to take part, the child will lose interest in  the play and turn his attention to them.    Children differ very much in their attitude towards books. One child  quite early in the second year will be happy poring over picture  books, while another will seldom glance at the contents and finds  pleasure only in turning over the pages, opening and shutting them,  and carrying them from place to place. Such differences are natural  enough and foreshadow perhaps the permanent characteristics that  divide men and women, and produce in later life men of thought and men  of action, women who are Marthas and women who are Marys.  Nevertheless, we should bear in mind that there is danger in a  training that is too one sided, and that books and toys have both  their part to play in developing the powers of the child. All the  activities of the child should be used in as varied a way as possible.  The eye is but one doorway to knowledge and understanding, the ear is  another, the hand a third.    From pictures an imaginative child will derive very strong  impressions, and mothers should be careful in their choice. It is  foolish to confuse the growth of aesthetic perceptions by presenting  children with books which depict children as grotesquely ugly beings  with goggle eyes and heads like rubber balls. Children love animals  and endow them with all their own reasoning attributes, and in  stories of the home life of rabbits, and bears, and squirrels they  take a pure delight. Books of the \"Struwwelpeter\" type are less to be  recommended. The faults which they are intended to eradicate become  peculiarly attractive from much familiarity. A little boy of two and a  half who resolutely refused all food for some days was in the end  detected to be playing the part of that Augustus, once so chubby and  fat, who reduced himself to a skeleton, saying, \"Take the nasty soup  away; I don't want any soup to-day.\" Tales of naughty children who  meet with a distressing fate may either frighten the child unduly, or  else produce in a child of inquiring mind the desire to brave his fate  and put the matter to the test. Pictures should not be terrifying or  horrible. Ogres devouring children are out of place as subjects for  pictures and may cause night-terrors.    Children should be taught to be careful of books and toys. The  indestructible book, generally falsely so called, is often responsible  for the immediate dissolution of all others less protected which come  to hand. The sympathy which little children have with the sufferings  of all inanimate objects and their habit of endowing them with their  own sensations may be made of use in teaching them care and  gentleness. They are naturally prone to sympathise with the doll that  has been crushed or the book that has been torn. They will learn very  easily to be kind to a pet animal and to be solicitous for its  feelings, and the lesson so learnt will be applied to inanimate  objects as well.    There is, however, another side to the question. It is true that if  the child is not to be over-stimulated upon the psychical side, we  must see to it that his play, for the most part, is not dependent upon  the participation of grown-up persons. In practice this excessive  stimulation is the common fault with which we meet. There are few  children in well-to-do homes, with loving mothers and devoted nurses,  who suffer from too little mothering and nursing. Too many show signs  of too much. To observe the opposite fault we must seek the infants  and children who for a long time are inmates of institutions,  orphanages, infirmaries, hospitals, and so forth. In such surroundings  the mental life of the child may languish. His physical wants are  cared for, but there the matter ends. In a rigid routine he is washed  and fed, but he may not be talked to or played with or stimulated in  any way. His day is spent passively lying in his cot, unnoticed and  unnoticing. I have seen a poor child of three years just released from  such a life, and after eighteen months returned to his mother, unable  to talk and almost unable to walk, crying pitifully at the novelty and  strangeness of the noisy life to which he had returned, worried by  contact with the other children, and without any desire or power to  occupy himself in the home. For an hour in the day mothers may devote  themselves wholeheartedly to the children, and if they set them  romping till they are tired out, so much the better. In the garden or  in an airy room with the windows open, a game with a ball or a toy  balloon, or a game of hide-and-seek, will be all to the good, and the  children may climb and be rolled over and swung about to their heart's  content. With an only child, especially with a child whose home is in  town, and whose outings are limited to a sedate airing in the park,  such free play is especially necessary. It may help more than anything  else to quiet restless minds and tempers that are on edge all day long  from excessive repression.    On the other hand, those forms of entertainment which are known as  \"children's parties\" are generally fruitful of ill results, at any  rate with nervous and highly-strung children. Sometimes they entail a  postponement of the usual bedtime, and nearly always they involve  over-heated and crowded rooms. Perverse custom has decreed that these  gatherings shall take place most commonly in the winter, when dark and  cold add nothing to the pleasure and a great deal to the risk of  infection which must always attend the crowding of susceptible  children together in a confined space with faulty ventilation. There  is clearly on the score of health much less objection to summer garden  parties for children, but these for some reason are less the vogue. As  a rule parties are not enjoyed by nervous children. There is intense  excitement in anticipation, and when at length the moment arrives,  there is apt to be disillusion. Either the excitement of the child may  pass all bounds and end in tears and so-called naughtiness, or the  unfamiliar surroundings may leave him distrait with a strange sense of  unreality and unhappiness. It is not always fair to blame the want of  wisdom in his hostess's choice of eatables, if the excited and  overstimulated child fails in the work of digestion and returns to the  nursery to suffer the reaction, with pains and much sickness.    The same arguments may be urged against taking little children to the  theatre. The nerve strain is apt to be out of proportion to the  enjoyment gained. If children must go to theatres and parties, the  treat should be kept secret from them until the moment of its  realisation, in order that the period of mental excitement should be  contracted as much as possible, and grown-up people should be advised  to treat the whole expedition in a matter-of-fact sort of way that  does nothing to add to the excitement or increase the risk of  subsequent disillusion.          CHAPTER VIII    NERVOUSNESS IN EARLY INFANCY      We may now pass back to consider the nervous system of the child in  infancy. There, too, from the moment of birth there are clearly-marked  differences between individuals. The newborn baby has a personality of  his own, and mothers will note with astonishment and delight how  strongly marked variations in conduct and behaviour may be from the  first. One baby is pleased and contented, another is fidgety,  restless, and enterprising. At birth the baby wakes from his long  sleep to find his environment completely changed. Within the uterus he  lies in unconsciousness because no ordinary stimulus from the outer  world can reach him to exert its effect. He lies immersed in fluid,  which, obeying the laws of physics, exercises a pressure which is  uniformly distributed over all points of his body. No sound reaches  him, and no light. After birth all this is suddenly changed. The sense  of new points of pressure breaks in upon his consciousness. Cold air  strikes upon his skin. Loud sounds and bright lights evoke a  characteristic response. A placid child who inherits a relatively  obtuse nervous organisation will be but little upset by this sudden  and radical change in the nature of his environment. His"]]]
