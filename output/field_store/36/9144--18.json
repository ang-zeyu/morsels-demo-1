One day while they were here, the young men who had been sent out to  look for buffalo, came hurrying into camp and told the chiefs that a  large herd of buffalo were near, and that among them was a spotted  calf.    The Head Chief of the Pawnees had a very beautiful daughter, and when he  heard about the spotted calf, he ordered his old crier to go about  through the village and call out that the man who killed the spotted  calf should have his daughter for his wife. For a spotted robe is  _ti-war'-uks-ti_--big medicine.    The buffalo were feeding about four miles from the village, and the  chiefs decided that the charge should be made from there. In this way,  the man who had the fastest horse would be the most likely to kill the  calf. Then all the warriors and the young men picked out their best and  fastest horses, and made ready to start. Among those who prepared for  the charge was the poor boy on the old dun horse. But when they saw him,  all the rich young braves on their fast horses pointed at him and said,  \"Oh, see; there is the horse that is going to catch the spotted calf;\"  and they laughed at him, so that the poor boy was ashamed, and rode off  to one side of the crowd, where he could not hear their jokes and  laughter.    When he had ridden off some little way the horse stopped and turned his  head round, and spoke to the boy. He said, \"Take me down the creek, and  plaster me all over with mud. Cover my head and neck and body and legs.\"  When the boy heard the horse speak, he was afraid; but he did as he was  told. Then the horse said, \"Now mount, but do not ride back to the  warriors, who laugh at you because you have such a poor horse. Stay  right here until the word is given to charge.\" So the boy stayed there.    And presently all the fine horses were drawn up in line and pranced  about, and were so eager to go that their riders could hardly hold them  in; and at last the old crier gave the word, \"_Loo-ah!_\"--Go! Then the  Pawnees all leaned forward on their horses and yelled, and away they  went. Suddenly, away off to the right, was seen the old dun horse. He  did not seem to run. He seemed to sail along like a bird. He passed all  the fastest horses, and in a moment he was among the buffalo. First he  picked out the spotted calf, and charging up alongside of it,  _U-ra-rish!_ straight flew the arrow. The calf fell. The boy drew  another arrow, and killed a fat cow that was running by. Then he  dismounted and began to skin the calf, before any of the other warriors  had come up. But when the rider got off the old dun horse, how changed  he was! He pranced about and would hardly stand still near the dead  buffalo. His back was all right again; his legs were well and fine; and  both his eyes were clear and bright.    The boy skinned the calf and the cow that he had killed, and then he  packed all the meat on the horse, and put the spotted robe on top of the  load, and started back to the camp on foot, leading the dun horse. But  even with this heavy load the horse pranced all the time, and was scared  at everything he saw. On the way to camp, one of the rich young chiefs  of the tribe rode up by the boy and offered him twelve good horses for  the spotted robe, so that he could marry the Head Chief's beautiful  daughter; but the boy laughed at him and would not sell the robe.    Now, while the boy walked to the camp leading the dun horse, most of the  warriors rode back, and one of those that came first to the village went  to the old woman and said to her, \"Your grandson has killed the spotted  calf.\" And the old woman said, \"Why do you come to tell me this? You  ought to be ashamed to make fun of my boy, because he is poor.\" The  warrior said, \"What I have told you is true,\" and then he rode away.  After a little while another brave rode up to the old woman, and said to  her, \"Your grandson has killed the spotted calf.\" Then the old woman  began to cry, she felt so badly because every one made fun of her boy,  because he was poor.    Pretty soon the boy came along, leading the horse up to the lodge where  he and his grandmother lived. It was a little lodge, just big enough for  two, and was made of old pieces of skin that the old woman had picked  up, and was tied together with strings of rawhide and sinew. It was the  meanest and worst lodge in the village. When the old woman saw her boy  leading the dun horse with the load of meat and the robes on it, she was  very surprised. The boy said to her, \"Here, I have brought you plenty of  meat to eat, and here is a robe, that you may have for yourself. Take  the meat off the horse.\" Then the old woman laughed, for her heart was  glad. But when she went to take the meat from the horse's back, he  snorted and jumped about, and acted like a wild horse. The old woman  looked at him in wonder, and could hardly believe that it was the same  horse. So the boy had to take off the meat, for the horse would not let  the old woman come near him.      III    That night the horse spoke again to the boy and said, \"_Wa-ti-hes  Chah'-ra-rat wa-ta_. Tomorrow the Sioux are coming--a large war party.  They will attack the village, and you will have a great battle. Now,  when the Sioux are all drawn up in line of battle, and are all ready to  fight, you jump on to me, and ride as hard as you can, right into the  middle of the Sioux, and up to their Head Chief, their greatest warrior,  and count _coup_ on him, and kill him, and then ride back. Do this four  times, and count _coup_ on four of the bravest Sioux, and kill them, but  don't go again. If you go the fifth time, maybe you will be killed, or  else you will lose me. _La-ku'-ta-chix_--remember.\" So the boy promised.    The next day it happened as the horse had said, and the Sioux came down  and formed in line of battle. Then the boy took his bow and arrows, and  jumped on the dun horse, and charged into the midst of them. And when  the Sioux saw that he was going to strike their Head Chief, they all  shot their arrows at him, and the arrows flew so thickly across each  other that they darkened the sky, but none of them hit the boy. And he  counted _coup_ on the Chief, and killed him, and then rode back. After  that he charged again among the Sioux, where they were gathered  thickest, and counted _coup_ on their bravest warrior, and killed him.  And then twice more, until he had gone four times as the horse had told  him.    But the Sioux and the Pawnees kept on fighting, and the boy stood around  and watched the battle. And at last he said to himself, \"I have been  four times and have killed four Sioux, and I am all right, I am not hurt  anywhere; why may I not go again?\" So he jumped on the dun horse, and  charged again. But when he got among the Sioux, one Sioux warrior drew  an arrow and shot. The arrow struck the dun horse behind the forelegs  and pierced him through. And the horse fell down dead. But the boy  jumped off, and fought his way through the Sioux, and ran away as fast  as he could to the Pawnees. Now, as soon as the horse was killed, the  Sioux said to each other: \"This horse was like a man. He was brave. He  was not like a horse.\" And they took their knives and hatchets, and  hacked the dun horse and gashed his flesh, and cut him into small  pieces.    The Pawnees and Sioux fought all day long, but toward night the Sioux  broke and fled.      IV    The boy felt very badly that he had lost his horse; and, after the fight  was over, he went out from the village to where it had taken place, to  mourn for his horse. He went to the spot where the horse lay, and  gathered up all the pieces of flesh, which the Sioux had cut off, and  the legs and the hoofs, and put them all together in a pile. Then he  went off to the top of a hill near by, and sat down and drew his robe  over his head, and began to mourn for his horse.    As he sat there, he heard a great wind-storm coming up, and it passed  over him with a loud rushing sound, and after the wind came a rain. The  boy looked down from where he sat to the pile of flesh and bones, which  was all that was left of his horse, and he could just see it through the  rain. And the rain passed by, and his heart was very heavy, and he kept  on mourning.    And pretty soon came another rushing wind, and after it a rain; and as  he looked through the driving rain toward the spot where the pieces lay,  he thought that they seemed to come together and take shape, and that  the pile looked like a horse lying down, but he could not see well for  the thick rain.    After this came a third storm like the others; and now when he looked  toward the horse he thought he saw its tail move from side to side two  or three times, and that it lifted its head from the ground. The boy was  afraid, and wanted to run away, but he stayed.    And as he waited, there came another storm. And while the rain fell,  looking through the rain, the boy saw the horse raise himself up on his  forelegs and look about. Then the dun horse stood up.      V    The boy left the place where he had been sitting on the hilltop, and  went down to him. When the boy had come near to him, the horse spoke  and said: \"You have seen how it has been this day; and from this you may  know how it will be after this. But _Ti-ra'-wa_ has been good, and has  let me come back to you. After this, do what I tell you; not any more,  not any less.\" Then the horse said: \"Now lead me off, far away from the  camp, behind that big hill, and leave me there to-night, and in the  morning come for me;\" and the boy did as he was told.    And when he went for the horse in the morning, he found with him a  beautiful white gelding, much more handsome than any horse in the tribe.  That night the dun horse told the boy to take him again to the place  behind the big hill, and to come for him the next morning; and when the  boy went for him again, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],[0,"The Child's World: Third Reader (#16)"],[1," on the ground and laughing so that the tears run down his  cheeks_): Oh, but this is fine! First I was fat and old. Now I am as big  a goose as any in the flock. What would my courtiers say?    (Springing up suddenly.)    Look at that \"court gander\"! There he goes with the whole flock.    (He dashes wildly after the geese and tries to crack the whip, but  cannot.)    Now they are in the meadow; what will the boy say?    (Boy returns and sees the geese in the meadow; the king looks ashamed.)    BOY: Just as I expected. I have found the book, but you have lost the  geese. What a time I shall have trying to find them!    KING: Never mind; I will help you get them together again.    [Illustration: The king and the boy look for the geese]    BOY: Humph! Much help you'll be. But go there by that stump and don't  let the geese pass you. Wave your arms at them and shout at them. Surely  you can do that!    KING: I'll try.      ACT III      Boy: Well, they are back again! Thanks to goodness, but none to you.  What can you do?    KING: Pray excuse me for not doing any better, but you see, I am not  used to work. I am the king.    BOY: I was a simpleton to trust you with the geese; but I am not such a  simpleton as to believe that you are the king.    KING: Just as you will. You are a good lad. Here is another gold coin as  a peace offering. Good-day.    BOY (_as king walks away_): He is a kind gentleman, whoever he may be;  but take my word for it, he will never make a gooseherd.    --OLD TALE.          DONAL AND CONAL    I      There was once in old Ireland a very fine lad by the name of Donal. He  was not only a very fine lad, but a very gay lad. He would go for miles  to a party or a wedding; and he was always welcome, for Donal knew where  to wear his smile. He wore it on his face instead of keeping it in his  pocket.    The dearest wish of Donal's heart no one knew but himself. His soul was  full of music, and he longed to have a violin.    One night Donal was going home through a dark forest when a storm came  up. He found an old hollow tree and got inside of it to keep dry. Soon  he fell asleep.    After a while Donal was awakened by a strange noise. He peeped out, and  he saw a queer sight. The storm had passed, and the moon was shining.  Many elves were dancing to strange music played by an old, old elf.    [Illustration: Donal sees the fairies dancing]    Such queer dancing it was! Donal crept out of the tree and drew nearer  and nearer. Suddenly he laughed out loud and said, \"Well, that's the  worst dancing I have ever seen!\"    The fairies were astonished and angry, and they all began to talk at the  same time.    \"We have a man among us!\" cried one.    \"Let us hang him!\" cried another.    \"Cut his head off!\" cried a third.    But the queen stepped out among them and said, \"Leave him to me.\"    Then she called Donal to her. Now Donal was a wee bit frightened, but he  knew where to wear his smile, you remember. So he went up to the queen,  smiling and bowing.    \"You say our dancing is the worst you have ever seen,\" she said. \"Now,  show us that you can do better.\"    Donal smiled again and bowed low. Then he began to dance. Such dancing  the elves had never seen! They clapped their hands and made him dance  again and again. Finally, Donal was exhausted, and after making a low  bow to the queen, sat down on the ground.    The fairies crowded around him.    \"Give him our silver!\" cried one.    \"Make it gold!\" cried another.    \"Diamonds!\" cried a third.    But the queen said, \"Leave it to me.\"    She went up to the old, old elf who had been playing for the dance.  Taking his violin from him, she gave it to Donal. You see, the queen  knew the dearest wish of his heart.    Then Donal was a happy lad, indeed! He thanked the queen and went home  playing on his new violin.      II      There lived near Donal's home a lad named Conal. He was not such a fine  lad as Donal, nor such a gay one. He was a greedy lad, and the dearest  wish of his heart was to be rich. And he did not know where to wear his  smile. If he had one, he kept it in his pocket.    When Conal heard what had happened to Donal, he wished to know all about  it. So he went to him and said, \"Donal, man, how did you get that  beautiful violin?\"    Donal told the story backward and forward, and forward and backward,  from beginning to end, until Conal knew it by heart.    Then Conal said to himself, \"I will go to the hollow tree and dance for  the elves; but I shall not be so foolish as Donal. I will take their  gold and silver, and their diamonds, too.\"    That night Conal went to the hollow tree and waited until the elves  appeared. Then he crept out and watched them dance. And he said, just as  Donal had, \"Well, that's the worst dancing I have ever seen!\"    The fairies were astonished and angry again, and again they all began to  talk at once.    \"Another man among us!\" cried one.    \"Let us hang him!\" cried another.    \"Cut off his head!\" cried a third.    But the queen said, \"Leave it to me.\"    Then she called Conal to her. Now Conal did not know where to wear his  smile, you remember; he always kept it in his pocket. So he went up to  the queen with a very sour face.    The queen said to him, as she had to Donal, \"You say our dancing is the  worst you have ever seen. Now, show us that you can do better.\"    Conal began to dance, and he could dance well. The elves were delighted.  They clapped their hands and asked him to dance again, but he said  roughly, \"No, that is enough. Do you expect me to dance all night?\"    The elves were silent then, and the queen's face was stern. But she was  a just queen, and she said, \"You have danced well. Will you have some of  our silver?\"    \"Yes,\" said Conal, without a word of thanks; and he filled his coat  pockets.    \"Will you have gold?\" asked the queen.    \"Yes,\" said Conal greedily, as he filled the pockets in his trousers.    \"Will you have some of our diamonds?\" the queen asked, and her face was  dark with anger.    \"Yes, yes,\" cried Conal.    \"You shall not have them, you greedy lad!\" cried the queen; \"you shall  have nothing.\"    Just then a cloud passed across the moon, and the elves vanished.    \"Oh, well,\" said Conal, \"I have the gold and silver.\"    He plunged his hands into his pockets and lo! the gold and silver had  turned to stones. Then Conal went home a sadder and a wiser lad.    --IRISH TALE.          [Illustration: A bird singing]    WHO TOLD THE NEWS?        Oh, the sunshine told the bluebird,      And the bluebird told the brook,    That the dandelions were peeping      From the woodland's sheltered nook.      Then the brook was blithe and happy,      And it babbled all the way,    As it ran to tell the river      Of the coming of the May.      Soon the river told the meadow,      And the meadow told the bee,    That the tender buds were swelling      On the old horse-chestnut tree.      And the bee shook off its torpor,      And it spread each gauzy wing,    As it flew to tell the flowers      Of the coming of the spring.          THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH    I      It was spring. The apple trees and the cherry trees were pink and white  with blossoms. They filled the air with fragrance. The maples were red,  and on the oak and poplar the buds were swelling. The brooklets were  rushing and leaping on toward the sea.    It was spring everywhere. The robin and the bluebird were piping sweetly  in the blossoming orchard. The sparrows were chirping, and hungry crows  were calling loudly for food. The farmers of Killingworth were plowing  the fields, and the broken clods, too, told of spring.    A farmer heard the cawing of the crows and the song of the birds.    He said, \"Did one ever see so many birds? Why, when we plant our seeds,  these birds will take them all. When the fruit ripens, they will destroy  it. I, for one, wish there were no birds, and I say kill them all.\"    Another farmer said, \"Yes, let us call a meeting of the people of the  village and decide what is to be done with the pests.\"    The meeting was called, and all came: the squire, the preacher, the  teacher, and the farmers from the country round about.    Up rose the farmer who had said he wished there were no birds.    \"Friends,\" he said, \"the crows are about to take my field of corn. I put  up scarecrows, but the birds fly by them and seem to laugh at them. The  robins are as saucy as they can be. Soon they will eat all the cherries  we have. I say kill all birds; they are a pest.\"    \"So say I,\" said another farmer.    \"And I,\" said another.    \"And I,\" \"And I,\" came from voices in every part of the hall.    The teacher arose and timidly said:    \"My friends, you know not what you do. You would put to death the birds  that make sweet music for us in our dark hours: the thrush, the oriole,  the noisy jay, the bluebird, the meadow lark.    \"You slay them all, and why? Because they scratch up a little handful of  wheat or corn, while searching for worms or weevils.    \"Do you never think who made them and who taught them their songs of  love? Think of your woods and orchards without birds!    \"And, friends, would you rather have insects in the hay? You call the  birds thieves, but they guard your farms. They drive the enemy from your  cornfields and from your harvests.    \"Even the blackest of them, the crow, does good. He crushes the beetle  and wages war on the slug and the snail.    \"And, what is more, how can I teach your children gentleness and mercy  when you contradict the very thing I teach?\"    But the farmers only shook their heads and laughed. \"What does the  teacher know of such things?\" they asked. And they passed a law to have  the birds killed.    So the dreadful war on birds began. They fell down dead, with  bloodstains on their breasts. Some fluttered, wounded, away from the  sight of man, while the young died of starvation in the nests.      II      The summer came, and all the birds were dead. The "]]]
