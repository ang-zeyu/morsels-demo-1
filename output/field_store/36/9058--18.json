The cattle  upon the thousand hills are dressed by the hand divine. Who, studying  God in his works, can doubt, that he will smile upon the evidence of  correct taste manifested by his children in clothing the forms he has  made them?    2. LOVE OF DRESS.--To love dress is not to be a slave of fashion; to  love dress only is the test of such homage. To transact the business  of charity in a silken dress, and to go in a carriage to the work,  injures neither the work nor the worker. The slave of fashion is one  who assumes the livery of a princess, and then omits the errand of the  good human soul; dresses in elegance, and goes upon no good errand,  and thinks and does nothing of value to mankind.    3. BEAUTY IN DRESS.--Beauty in dress is a good thing, rail at it who  may. But it is a lower beauty, for which a higher beauty should not  be sacrificed. They love dresses too much who give it their first  thought, their best time, or all their money; who for it neglect  the culture of their mind or heart, or the claims of others on their  service; who care more for their dress than their disposition; who are  troubled more by an unfashionable bonnet than a neglected duty.    4. SIMPLICITY OF DRESS.--Female lovliness never appears to so good  advantage as when set off by simplicity of dress. No artist ever decks  his angels with towering feathers and gaudy jewelry; and our dear  human angels--if they would make good their title to that name--should  carefully avoid ornaments, which properly belong to Indian squaws and  African princesses. These tinselries may serve to give effect on the  stage, or upon the ball room floor, but in daily life there is no  substitute for the charm of simplicity. A vulgar taste is not to  be disguised by gold or diamonds. The absence of a true taste and  refinement of delicacy cannot be compensated for by the possession of  the most princely fortune. Mind measures gold, but gold cannot measure  mind. Through dress the mind may be read, as through the delicate  tissue the lettered page. A modest woman will dress modestly; a really  refined and intelligent woman will bear the marks of careful selection  and faultless taste.    5. PEOPLE OF SENSE.--A coat that has the mark of use upon it, is a  recommendation to the people of sense, and a hat with too much nap,  and too high lustre, a derogatory circumstance. The best coats in  our streets are worn on the backs of penniless fops, broken down  merchants, clerks with pitiful salaries, and men that do not pay  up. The heaviest gold chains dangle from the fobs of gamblers and  gentlemen of very limited means; costly ornaments on ladies, indicate  to the eyes that are well opened, the fact of a silly lover or husband  cramped for funds.    6. PLAIN AND NEAT.--When a pretty woman goes by in plain and neat  apparel, it is the presumption that she has fair expectations, and  a husband that can show a balance in his favor. For women are like  books,--too much gilding makes men suspicious, that the binding is the  most important part. The body is the shell of the soul, and the dress  is the husk of the body; but the husk generally tells what the kernel  is. As a fashionably dressed young lady passed some gentlemen, one of  them raised his hat, whereupon another, struck by the fine appearance  of the lady, made some inquiries concerning her, and was answered  thus: \"She makes a pretty ornament in her father's house, but  otherwise is of no use.\"    7. THE RICHEST DRESS.--The richest dress is always worn on the soul.  The adornments that will not perish, and that all men most admire,  shine from the heart through this life. God has made it our highest,  holiest duty, to dress the souls he has given us. It is wicked to  waste it in frivolity. It is a beautiful, undying, precious thing. If  every young woman would think of her soul when she looks in the  glass, would hear the cry of her naked mind when she dallies away her  precious hours at her toilet, would listen to the sad moaning of her  hollow heart, as it wails through her idle, useless life, something  would be done for the elevation of womanhood.    8. DRESSING UP.--Compare a well-dressed body with a well-dressed mind.  Compare a taste for dress with a taste for knowledge, culture,  virtue, and piety. Dress up an ignorant young woman in the \"height of  fashion\"; put on plumes and flowers, diamonds and gewgaws; paint her  face, girt up her waist, and I ask you, if this side of a painted and  feathered savage you can find anything more unpleasant to behold. And  yet such young women we meet by the hundred every day on the street  and in all our public places. It is awful to think of.    9. DRESS AFFECTS OUR MANNERS.--A man who is badly dressed, feels  chilly, sweaty, and prickly. He stammers, and does not always tell the  truth. He means to, perhaps, but he can't. He is half distracted about  his pantaloons, which are much to short, and are constantly hitching  up; or his frayed jacket and crumpled linen harrow his soul, and quite  unman him. He treads on the train of a lady's dress, and says, \"Thank  you\", sits down on his hat, and wishes the \"desert were his dwelling  place.\"    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    BEAUTY.        \"She walks in beauty, like the night    Of cloudless climes and starry skies:    And all that's best of dark and bright    Meet her in aspect and in her eyes;    Thus mellowed to that tender light    Which heaven to gaudy day denies.\"    --BYRON.      1. THE HIGHEST STYLE OF BEAUTY.--The highest style of beauty to be  found in nature pertains to the human form, as animated and lighted  up by the intelligence within. It is the expression of the soul that  constitutes this superior beauty. It is that which looks out of the  eye, which sits in calm majesty on the brow, lurks on the lip, smiles  on the cheek, is set forth in the chiselled lines and features of  the countenance, in the general contour of figure and form, in  the movement, and gesture, and tone; it is this looking out of the  invisible spirit that dwells within, this manifestation of the higher  nature, that we admire and love; this constitutes to us the beauty of  our species.    2. BEAUTY WHICH PERISHES NOT.--There is a beauty which perishes not.  It is such as the angels wear. It forms the washed white robes of the  saints. It wreathes the countenance of every doer of good. It adorns  every honest face. It shines in the virtuous life. It molds the hands  of charity. It sweetens the voice of sympathy. It sparkles on the brow  of wisdom. It flashes in the eye of love. It breathes in the spirit of  piety. It is the beauty of the heaven of heavens. It is that which may  grow by the hand of culture in every human soul. It is the flower of  the spirit which blossoms on the tree of life. Every soul may plant  and nurture it in its own garden, in its own Eden.    3. WE MAY ALL BE BEAUTIFUL.--This is the capacity of beauty that God  has given to the human soul, and this the beauty placed within  the reach of all. We may all be beautiful. Though our forms may  be uncomely and our features not the prettiest, our spirits may be  beautiful. And this inward beauty always shines through. A beautiful  heart will flash out in the eye. A lovely soul will glow in the face.  A sweet spirit will tune the voice, wreathe the countenance in charms.  Oh, there is a power in interior beauty that melts the hardest heart!    4. WOMAN THE MOST PERFECT TYPE OF BEAUTY.--Woman, by common consent,  we regard as the most perfect type of beauty on earth. To her we  ascribe the highest charms belonging to this wonderful element so  profusely mingled in all God's works. Her form is molded and finished  in exquisite delicacy of perfection. The earth gives us no form  more perfect, no features more symmetrical, no style more chaste, no  movements more graceful, no finish more complete; so that our artists  ever have and ever will regard the woman-form of humanity as the  most perfect earthly type of beauty. This form is most perfect and  symmetrical in the youth of womanhood; so that the youthful woman is  earth's queen of beauty. This is true, not only by the common consent  of mankind, but also by the strictest rules of scientific criticism.    5. FADELESS BEAUTY.--There cannot be a picture without its bright  spots; and the steady contemplation of what is bright in others, has  a reflex influence upon the beholder. It reproduces what it reflects.  Nay, it seems to leave an impress even upon the countenance. The  feature, from having a dark, sinister aspect, becomes open, serene,  and sunny. A countenance so impressed, has neither the vacant stare of  the idiot, nor the crafty, penetrating look of the basilisk, but the  clear, placid aspect of truth and goodness. The woman who has such  a face is beautiful. She has a beauty which changes not with the  features, which fades not with years. It is beauty of expression. It  is the only kind of beauty which can be relied upon for a permanent  influence with the other sex. The violet will soon cease to smile.  Flowers must fade. The love that has nothing but beauty to sustain it,  soon withers away.    [Illustration: HAND IN HAND.]    6. A PRETTY WOMAN PLEASES THE EYE, a good woman, the heart. The one  is a jewel, the other a treasure. Invincible fidelity, good humor, and  complacency of temper, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make  the decay of it invisible. That is true beauty which has not only  a substance, but a spirit; a beauty that we must intimately know to  justly appreciate.    7. THE WOMAN YOU LOVE BEST.--Beauty, dear reader, is probably the  woman you love best, but we trust it is the beauty of soul and  character, which sits in calm majesty on the brow, lurks on the lip,  and will outlive what is called a fine face.    8. THE WEARING OF ORNAMENTS.--Beauty needs not the foreign aid  of ornament, but is when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13468"],[0,"The New Jerusalem (#16)"],[1,"ratic, between such inventions  and the self-evident rights which no man can claim to have invented.  If the Arab says to me, \"I don't care a curse for Europe; I demand bread,\"  the reproach is to me both true and terrible.  But if he says,  \"I don't care a curse for Europe; I demand French cookery,  Italian confectionery, English audit ale,\" and so on, I think he is  rather an unreasonable Arab.  After all, we invented these things;  in _auctore auctoritas_.    And of this problem there is a sort of working model in the presence  of the snow in Palestine, especially in the light of the old proverb  about the impossibility of snow in Egypt.  Palestine is wilder,  less wealthy and modernised, more religious and therefore more realistic.  The issue between the things only a European can do, and the things  no European has the right to do, is much sharper and clearer  than the confusions of verbosity.  On the one hand the things  the English can do are more real things, like clearing away the snow;  for the very reason that the English are not here, so to speak,  building on a French pavement but on the bare rocks of the Eastern wilds,  the contact with Islam and Israel is more simple and direct.  And on the other side the discontents and revolts are more real.  So far from intending to suggest that the Egyptians have no complaints,  I am very far from meaning that they have no wrongs.  But curiously  enough the wrongs seem to me more real than the complaints.  The real case against our Egyptian adventure was stated long ago  by Randolph Churchill, when he denounced \"a bondholder's war\"; it is  in the whole business of collecting debts due to cosmopolitan finance.  But a stranger in Egypt hears little denunciation of cosmopolitan finance,  and a great deal of drivel in the way of cosmopolitan idealism.  When the Palestinians say that usurers menace their land they mean  the land they dig; an old actuality and not a new abstraction.  Their revolt may be right or wrong, but it is real;  and what applies to their revolt applies to their religion.  There may well be doubts about whether Egypt is a nation, but there  is no doubt that Jerusalem is a city, and the nations have come  to its light.    The problem of the snow proved indeed the text for a tale touching  the practical politics of the city.  The English soldiers cleared  the snow away; the Arabs sat down satisfied or stoical with  the snow blocking their own doors or loading their own roofs.  But the Jews, as the story went, were at length persuaded to clear  away the snow in front of them, and then demanded a handsome  salary for having recovered the use of their own front doors.  The story is not quite fair; and yet it is not so unfair as it seems.  Any rational Anti-Semite will agree that such tales, even when they  are true, do not always signify an avaricious tradition in Semitism,  but sometimes the healthier and more human suggestion of Bolshevism.  The Jews do demand high wages, but it is not always because they  are in the old sense money-grabbers, but rather in the new  sense money-grabbers (as an enemy would put it) men sincerely  and bitterly convinced of their right to the surplus of capitalism.  There is the same problem in the Jewish colonies in the country districts;  in the Jewish explanation of the employment of Arab and Syrian labour.  The Jews argue that this occurs, not because they wish to remain  idle capitalists, but because they insist on being properly  paid proletarians.  With all this I shall deal, however, when I  treat of the Jewish problem itself.  The point for the moment  is that the episode of the snow did in a superficial way suggest  the parts played by the three parties and the tales told about them.  To begin with, it is right to say that the English do a great many things,  as they clear away the snow, simply because nobody else would do them.  They did save the oriental inhabitants from some of the worst  consequences of the calamity.  Probably they sometimes save  the inhabitants from something which the inhabitants do not  regard as a calamity.  It is the danger of all such foreign  efficiency that it often saves men who do not want to be saved.  But they do in many cases do things from which Moslems profit,  but which Moslems by themselves would not propose, let alone perform.  And this has a general significance even in our first survey, for it  suggests a truth easy to abuse, but I think impossible to ignore.  I mean that there is something non-political about Moslem morality.  Perverse as it may appear, I suspect that most of their  political movements result from their non-political morality.  They become politicians because they know they are not political;  and feel their simple and more or less healthy life is at a disadvantage,  in face of the political supremacy of the English and the political  subtlety of the Jews.    For instance, the tradition of Turkish rule is simply a joke.  All the stories about it are jokes, and often very good jokes.  My own favourite incident is that which is still commemorated  in the English cathedral by an enormous hole in the floor.  The Turks dug up the pavement looking for concealed English artillery;  because they had been told that the bishop had given his blessing  to two canons.  The bishop had indeed recently appointed two canons  to the service of the Church, but he had not secreted them under  the floor of the chancel.  There was another agreeable incident when  the Turkish authorities, by an impulsive movement of religious toleration,  sent for a Greek priest to bury Greek soldiers, and told him  to take his choice in a heap of corpses of all creeds and colours.  But at once the most curious and the most common touch of comedy  is the perpetual social introduction to solid and smiling citizens  who have been nearly hanged by the Turks.  The fortunate gentleman  seems still to be regarding his escape with a broad grin.  If you were introduced to a polite Frenchman who had come straight  from the guillotine, or to an affable American who had only just  vacated the electrical chair, you would feel a faint curiosity  about the whole story.  If a friend introduced somebody, saying,  \"My friend Robinson; his sentence has been commuted to penal servitude,\"  or \"My Uncle William, just come from Dartmoor Prison,\" your mind  and perhaps your lips would faintly form the syllables \"What for?\"  But evidently, under Turkish rule, being hanged was like  being knocked down by a cab; it might happen to anybody.  This is a parenthesis, since I am only dealing here with the  superficial experience of the streets, especially in the snow.  But it will be well to safeguard it by saying that this unpolitical  carelessness and comprehensiveness of the indiscriminate Turk had its  tragic as well as its comic side.  It was by no means everybody that  escaped hanging; and there was a tree growing outside the Jaffa Gate  at which men might still shudder as they pass it in the sunlight.  It was what a modern revolutionary poet has called bitterly the Tree  of Man's Making; and what a medieval revolutionary poet called  the fruit tree in the orchard of the king.  It was the gibbet;  and lives have dropped from it like leaves from a tree in autumn.  Yet even on the sterner side, we can trace the truth about  the Moslem fatalism which seems so alien to political actuality.  There was a popular legend or proverb that this terrible tree  was in some way bound up with the power of the Turk, and perhaps  the Moslem over a great part of the earth.  There is nothing  more strange about that Moslem fatalism than a certain gloomy  magnanimity which can invoke omens and oracles against itself.  It is astonishing how often the Turks seem to have accepted a legend  or prophecy about their own ultimate failure.  De Quincey mentions  one of them in the blow that half broke the Palladium of Byzantium.  It is said that the Moslems themselves predict the entry  of a Christian king of Jerusalem through the Golden Gate.  Perhaps that is why they have blocked up the fatal gate;  but in any case they dealt in that fashion with the fatal tree.  They elaborately bound and riveted it with iron, as if accepting  the popular prophecy which declared that so long as it stood  the Turkish Empire would stand.  It was as if the wicked man  of Scripture had daily watered a green bay-tree, to make sure  that it should flourish.    In the last chapter I have attempted to suggest a background  of the battlemented walls with the low gates and narrow windows  which seem to relieve the liveliest of the coloured groups against  the neutral tints of the North, and how this was intensified  when the neutral tints were touched with the positive hue of snow.  In the same merely impressionist spirit I would here attempt to sketch  some of the externals of the actors in such a scene, though it is  hard to do justice to such a picture even in the superficial matter  of the picturesque.  Indeed it is hard to be sufficiently superficial;  for in the East nearly every external is a symbol.  The greater part of it is the gorgeous rag-heap of Arabian humanity,  and even about that one could lecture on almost every coloured rag.  We hear much of the gaudy colours of the East; but the most  striking thing about them is that they are delicate colours.  It is rare to see a red that is merely like a pillar-box, or a blue  that is Reckitt's blue; the red is sure to have the enrichment  of tawny wine or blood oranges, and the blue of peacocks or the sea.  In short these people are artistic in the sense that used to be  called aesthetic; and it is a nameless instinct that preserves  these nameless tints.  Like all such instincts, it can be  blunted by a bullying rationalism; like all such children,  these people do not know why they prefer the better, and can  therefore be persuaded by sophists that they prefer the worst.  But there are other elements"]]]
