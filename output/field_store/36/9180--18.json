Somerset made no great use of his victory: he  took and held Broughty Castle on Tay, fortified Inchcolme in the Firth of  Forth, and devastated Holyrood.  Mischief he did, to little purpose.    The child queen was conveyed to an isle in the loch of Menteith, where  she was safe, and her marriage with the Dauphin was negotiated.  In June  1548 a large French force under the Sieur d'Esse arrived, and later  captured Haddington, held by the English, while, despite some  Franco-Scottish successes in the field, Mary was sent with her Four  Maries to France, where she landed in August, the only passenger who had  not been sea-sick!  By April 1550 the English made peace, abandoning all  their holds in Scotland.  The great essential prize, the child queen, had  escaped them.    The clergy burned a martyr in 1550; in 1549 they had passed measures for  their own reformation: too late and futile was the scheme.  Early in 1549  Knox returned from France to England, where he was minister at Berwick  and at Newcastle, a chaplain of the child Edward VI., and a successful  opponent of Cranmer as regards kneeling at the celebration of the Holy  Communion.  He refused a bishopric, foreseeing trouble under Mary Tudor,  from whom he fled to the Continent.  In 1550-51 Mary of Guise, visiting  France, procured for Arran the Duchy of Chatelherault, and for his eldest  son the command of the Scottish Archer Guard, and, by way of exchange, in  1554 took from him the Regency, surrounding herself with French advisers,  notably De Roubay and d'Oysel.          CHAPTER XVIII.  REGENCY OF MARY OF GUISE.      In England, on the death of Edward VI., Catholicism rejoiced in the  accession of Mary Tudor, which, by driving Scottish Protestant refugees  back into their own country, strengthened there the party of revolt  against the Church, while the queen-mother's preference of French over  Scottish advisers, and her small force of trained French soldiers in  garrisons, caused even the Scottish Catholics to hold France in fear and  suspicion.  The French counsellors (1556) urged increased taxation for  purposes of national defence against England; but the nobles would rather  be invaded every year than tolerate a standing army in place of their old  irregular feudal levies.  Their own independence of the Crown was dearer  to the nobles and gentry than safety from their old enemy.  They might  have reflected that a standing army of Scots, officered by themselves,  would be a check on the French soldiers in garrison.    Perplexed and opposed by the great clan of Hamilton, whose chief, Arran,  was nearest heir to the crown, Mary of Guise was now anxious to  conciliate the Protestants, and there was a \"blink,\" as the Covenanters  later said,--a lull in persecution.    After Knox's release from the French galleys in 1549, he had played, as  we saw, a considerable part in the affairs of the English Church, and in  the making of the second Prayer-Book of Edward VI., but had fled abroad  on the accession of Mary Tudor.  From Dieppe he had sent a tract to  England, praying God to stir up some Phineas or Jehu to shed the blood of  \"abominable idolaters,\"--obviously of Mary of England and Philip of  Spain.  On earlier occasions he had followed Calvin in deprecating such  sanguinary measures.  The Scot, after a stormy period of quarrels with  Anglican refugees in Frankfort, moved to Geneva, where the city was under  a despotism of preachers and of Calvin.  Here Knox found the model of  Church government which, in a form if possible more extreme, he later  planted in Scotland.    There, in 1549-52, the Church, under Archbishop Hamilton, Beaton's  successor, had been confessing her iniquities in Provincial Councils, and  attempting to purify herself on the lines of the tolerant and charitable  Catechism issued by the Archbishop in 1552.  Apparently a _modus vivendi_  was being sought, and Protestants were inclined to think that they might  be \"occasional conformists\" and attend Mass without being false to their  convictions.  But in this brief lull Knox came over to Scotland at the  end of harvest, in 1555.  On this point of occasional conformity he was  fixed.  The Mass was idolatry, and idolatry, by the law of God, was a  capital offence.  Idolaters must be converted or exterminated; they were  no better than Amalekites.    This was the central rock of Knox's position: tolerance was impossible.  He remained in Scotland, preaching and administering the Sacrament in the  Genevan way, till June 1556.  He associated with the future leaders of  the religious revolution: Erskine of Dun, Lord Lorne (in 1558, fifth Earl  of Argyll), James Stewart, bastard of James V., and lay Prior of St  Andrews, and of Macon in France; and the Earl of Glencairn.  William  Maitland of Lethington, \"the flower of the wits of Scotland,\" was to Knox  a less congenial acquaintance.  Not till May 1556 was Knox summoned to  trial in Edinburgh, but he had a strong backing of the laity, as was the  custom in Scotland, where justice was overawed by armed gatherings, and  no trial was held.  By July 1556 he was in France, on his way to Geneva.    The fruits of Knox's labours followed him, in March 1557, in the shape of  a letter, signed by Glencairn, Lorne, Lord Erskine, and James Stewart,  Mary's bastard brother.  They prayed Knox to return.  They were ready \"to  jeopardy lives and goods in the forward setting of the glory of God.\"  This has all the air of risking civil war.  Knox was not eager.  It was  October before he reached Dieppe on his homeward way.  Meanwhile there  had been hostilities between England and Scotland (as ally of France,  then at odds with Philip of Spain, consort King of England), and there  were Protestant tumults in Edinburgh.  Knox had scruples as to raising  civil war by preaching at home.  The Scottish nobles had no zeal for the  English war; but Knox, who received at Dieppe discouraging letters from  unknown correspondents, did not cross the sea.  He remained at Dieppe,  preaching, till the spring of 1558.    In Knox's absence even James Stewart and Erskine of Dun agreed to hurry  on the marriage between Mary, Queen of Scots, and Francis, Dauphin of  France, a feeble boy, younger than herself.  Their faces are pitiably  young as represented in their coronation medal.    While negotiations for the marriage were begun in October, on December 3,  1557, a godly \"band\" or covenant for mutual aid was signed by Argyll  (then near his death, in 1558); his son, Lorne; the Earl of Morton (son  of the traitor, Sir George Douglas); Glencairn; and Erskine of Dun, one  of the commissioners who were to visit France for the Royal marriage.  They vow to risk their lives against \"the Congregation of Satan\" (the  Church), and in defence of faithful Protestant preachers.  They will  establish \"the blessed Word of God and His Congregation,\" and henceforth  the Protestant party was commonly styled \"The Congregation.\"    Parliament (November 29, 1557) had accepted the French marriage, all the  ancient liberties of Scotland being secured, and the right to the throne,  if Mary died without issue, being confirmed to the House of Hamilton, not  to the Dauphin.  The marriage-contract (April 19, 1558) did ratify these  just demands; but, on April 4, Mary had been induced to sign them all  away to France, leaving Scotland and her own claims to the English crown  to the French king.    The marriage was celebrated on April 24, 1558.  In that week the last  Protestant martyr, Walter Milne, an aged priest and a married man, was  burned for heresy at St Andrews.  This only increased the zeal of the  Congregation.    Among the Protestant preachers then in Scotland, of whom Willock, an  Englishman, seems to have been the most reasonable, a certain Paul  Methuen, a baker, was prominent.  He had been summoned (July 28) to stand  his trial for heresy, but his backing of friends was considerable, and  they came before Mary of Guise in armour and with a bullying demeanour.  She tried to temporise, and on September 3 a great riot broke out in  Edinburgh, the image of St Giles was broken, and the mob violently  assaulted a procession of priests.  The country was seething with  discontent, and the death of Mary Tudor (November 17, 1558), with the  accession of the Protestant Elizabeth, encouraged the Congregation.  Mary  of Guise made large concessions: only she desired that there should be no  public meetings in the capital.  On January 1, 1559, church doors were  placarded with \"The Beggars' Warning.\"  The Beggars (really the Brethren  in their name) claimed the wealth of the religious orders.  Threats were  pronounced, revolution was menaced at a given date, Whitsunday, and the  threats were fulfilled.    All this was the result of a plan, not of accident.  Mary of Guise was  intending to visit France, not longing to burn heretics.  But she fell  into the worst of health, and her recovery was doubted, in April 1559.  Willock and Methuen had been summoned to trial (February 2, 1559), for  their preachings were always apt to lead to violence on the part of their  hearers.  The summons was again postponed in deference to renewed  menaces: a Convention had met at Edinburgh to seek for some remedy, and  the last Provincial Council of the Scottish Church (March 1559) had  considered vainly some proposals by moderate Catholics for internal  reform. {106}    Again the preachers were summoned to Stirling for May 10, but just a week  earlier Knox arrived in Scotland.  The leader of the French Protestant  preachers, Morel, expressed to Calvin his fear that Knox \"may fill  Scotland with his madness.\"  Now was his opportunity: the Regent was weak  and ill; the Congregation was in great force; England was at least not  unfavourable to its cause.

Then little Gerda cried, and told her her  whole history, and all that the Ravens had done for her.    \"Poor little thing!\" said the Prince and the Princess. They praised the  Ravens very much, and told them they were not at all angry with them,  but they were not to do so again. However, they should have a reward.  \"Will you fly about here at liberty,\" asked the Princess; \"or would you  like to have a fixed appointment as court ravens, with all the broken  bits from the kitchen?\"    And both the Ravens nodded, and begged for a fixed appointment; for  they thought of their old age, and said, \"It is a good thing to have a  provision for our old days.\"    And the Prince got up and let Gerda sleep in his bed, and more than this  he could not do. She folded her little hands and thought, \"How good men  and animals are!\" and she then fell asleep and slept soundly. All the  dreams flew in again, and they now looked like the angels; they drew  a little sledge, in which little Kay sat and nodded his head; but the  whole was only a dream, and therefore it all vanished as soon as she  awoke.    The next day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and velvet. They  offered to let her stay at the palace, and lead a happy life; but she  begged to have a little carriage with a horse in front, and for a small  pair of shoes; then, she said, she would again go forth in the wide  world and look for Kay.    Shoes and a muff were given her; she was, too, dressed very nicely; and  when she was about to set off, a new carriage stopped before the door.  It was of pure gold, and the arms of the Prince and Princess shone  like a star upon it; the coachman, the footmen, and the outriders, for  outriders were there, too, all wore golden crowns. The Prince and the  Princess assisted her into the carriage themselves, and wished her all  success. The Raven of the woods, who was now married, accompanied her  for the first three miles. He sat beside Gerda, for he could not bear  riding backwards; the other Raven stood in the doorway, and flapped her  wings; she could not accompany Gerda, because she suffered from headache  since she had had a fixed appointment and ate so much. The carriage  was lined inside with sugar-plums, and in the seats were fruits and  gingerbread.    \"Farewell! Farewell!\" cried Prince and Princess; and Gerda wept, and  the Raven wept. Thus passed the first miles; and then the Raven bade her  farewell, and this was the most painful separation of all. He flew into  a tree, and beat his black wings as long as he could see the carriage,  that shone from afar like a sunbeam.      FIFTH STORY. The Little Robber Maiden    They drove through the dark wood; but the carriage shone like a torch,  and it dazzled the eyes of the robbers, so that they could not bear to  look at it.    \"'Tis gold! 'Tis gold!\" they cried; and they rushed forward, seized  the horses, knocked down the little postilion, the coachman, and the  servants, and pulled little Gerda out of the carriage.    \"How plump, how beautiful she is! She must have been fed on  nut-kernels,\" said the old female robber, who had a long, scrubby beard,  and bushy eyebrows that hung down over her eyes. \"She is as good as a  fatted lamb! How nice she will be!\" And then she drew out a knife, the  blade of which shone so that it was quite dreadful to behold.    \"Oh!\" cried the woman at the same moment. She had been bitten in the ear  by her own little daughter, who hung at her back; and who was so wild  and unmanageable, that it was quite amusing to see her. \"You naughty  child!\" said the mother: and now she had not time to kill Gerda.    \"She shall play with me,\" said the little robber child. \"She shall give  me her muff, and her pretty frock; she shall sleep in my bed!\" And then  she gave her mother another bite, so that she jumped, and ran round with  the pain; and the Robbers laughed, and said, \"Look, how she is dancing  with the little one!\"    \"I will go into the carriage,\" said the little robber maiden; and she  would have her will, for she was very spoiled and very headstrong. She  and Gerda got in; and then away they drove over the stumps of felled  trees, deeper and deeper into the woods. The little robber maiden was as  tall as Gerda, but stronger, broader-shouldered, and of dark complexion;  her eyes were quite black; they looked almost melancholy. She embraced  little Gerda, and said, \"They shall not kill you as long as I am not  displeased with you. You are, doubtless, a Princess?\"    \"No,\" said little Gerda; who then related all that had happened to her,  and how much she cared about little Kay.    The little robber maiden looked at her with a serious air, nodded her  head slightly, and said, \"They shall not kill you, even if I am angry  with you: then I will do it myself\"; and she dried Gerda's eyes, and put  both her hands in the handsome muff, which was so soft and warm.    At length the carriage stopped. They were in the midst of the court-yard  of a robber's castle. It was full of cracks from top to bottom; and out  of the openings magpies and rooks were flying; and the great bull-dogs,  each of which looked as if he could swallow a man, jumped up, but they  did not bark, for that was forbidden.    In the midst of the large, old, smoking hall burnt a great fire on the  stone floor. The smoke disappeared under the stones, and had to seek  its own egress. In an immense caldron soup was boiling; and rabbits and  hares were being roasted on a spit.    \"You shall sleep with me to-night, with all my animals,\" said the little  robber maiden. They had something to eat and drink; and then went into  a corner, where straw and carpets were lying. Beside them, on laths and  perches, sat nearly a hundred pigeons, all asleep, seemingly; but yet  they moved a little when the robber maiden came. \"They are all mine,\"  said she, at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs  and shaking it so that its wings fluttered. \"Kiss it,\" cried the little  girl, and flung the pigeon in Gerda's face. \"Up there is the rabble of  the wood,\" continued she, pointing to several laths which were fastened  before a hole high up in the wall; \"that's the rabble; they would all  fly away immediately, if they were not well fastened in. And here is my  dear old Bac\"; and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer, that had a  bright copper ring round its neck, and was tethered to the spot. \"We are  obliged to lock this fellow in too, or he would make his escape. Every  evening I tickle his neck with my sharp knife; he is so frightened at  it!\" and the little girl drew forth a long knife, from a crack in the  wall, and let it glide over the Reindeer's neck. The poor animal kicked;  the girl laughed, and pulled Gerda into bed with her.    \"Do you intend to keep your knife while you sleep?\" asked Gerda; looking  at it rather fearfully.    \"I always sleep with the knife,\" said the little robber maiden. \"There  is no knowing what may happen. But tell me now, once more, all about  little Kay; and why you have started off in the wide world alone.\" And  Gerda related all, from the very beginning: the Wood-pigeons cooed above  in their cage, and the others slept. The little robber maiden wound her  arm round Gerda's neck, held the knife in the other hand, and snored so  loud that everybody could hear her; but Gerda could not close her eyes,  for she did not know whether she was to live or die. The robbers sat  round the fire, sang and drank; and the old female robber jumped about  so, that it was quite dreadful for Gerda to see her.    Then the Wood-pigeons said, \"Coo! Coo! We have seen little Kay! A white  hen carries his sledge; he himself sat in the carriage of the Snow  Queen, who passed here, down just over the wood, as we lay in our nest.  She blew upon us young ones; and all died except we two. Coo! Coo!\"    \"What is that you say up there?\" cried little Gerda. \"Where did the Snow  Queen go to? Do you know anything about it?\"    \"She is no doubt gone to Lapland; for there is always snow and ice  there. Only ask the Reindeer, who is tethered there.\"    \"Ice and snow is there! There it is, glorious and beautiful!\" said the  Reindeer. \"One can spring about in the large shining valleys! The Snow  Queen has her summer-tent there; but her fixed abode is high up towards  the North Pole, on the Island called Spitzbergen.\"    \"Oh, Kay! Poor little Kay!\" sighed Gerda.    \"Do you choose to be quiet?\" said the robber maiden. \"If you don't, I  shall make you.\"    In the morning Gerda told her all that the Wood-pigeons had said; and  the little maiden looked very serious, but she nodded her head, and  said, \"That's no matter--that's no matter. Do you know where Lapland  lies!\" she asked of the Reindeer.    \"Who should know better than I?\" said the animal; and his eyes rolled in  his head. \"I was born and bred there--there I leapt about on the fields  of snow.\"    \"Listen,\" said the robber maiden to Gerda. \"You see that the men are  gone; but my mother is still here, and will remain. However, towards  morning she takes a draught out of the large flask, and then she sleeps  a little: then I will do something for you.\" She now jumped out of bed,  flew to her mother; with her arms round her neck, and pulling her by the  beard, said, \"Good morrow, my own sweet nanny-goat of a mother.\" And her  mother took hold of her nose, and pinched it till it was red and blue;  but this was all done out of pure love.    When the mother had taken a sup at her flask, and was having a nap, the  little robber maiden went to the Reindeer, and said, \"I should very much  like to give you still many a tickling with the sharp knife, for then  you are so amusing; however, I will untether you, and help you out,  so that you may go back to Lapland. But you must make good use of your  legs; and take this little girl for me to the palace of the Snow Queen,  where her playfellow is. You have heard, I"]]]
