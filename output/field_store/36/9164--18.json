We are obliged to roll on for some thirty  to fifty minutes longer before we find the moon. It must be going in  the same direction, and it takes us longer to get round to it than  if if it were always in the same spot; so we notice a star near the  moon one night--it is 13 deg. west of the moon the next night. The moon  is going around the earth from west to east, and if it goes 13 deg. in  one day, it will take a little more than twenty-seven days to go the  entire circle of 360 deg..    [Illustration: Fig. 42.--Showing the Sun's Movement among the Stars.]    [Page 111]  In our outlook we soon observe that we do not by our revolution  come to see the same stars rise at the same hour every night. Orion  and the Pleiades, our familiar friends in the winter heavens, are  gone from the summer sky. Have they fled, or are we turned from  them? This is easily understood from Fig. 42.    When the observer on the earth at A looks into the midnight sky  he sees the stars at E; but as the earth passes on to B, he sees  those stars at E three minutes sooner every night; and at midnight  the stars at F are over his head. Thus in a year, by going around  the sun, we have every star of the celestial dome in our midnight  sky. We see also how the sun appears among the successive  constellations. When we are at A, we see the sun among the stars  at G; but as we move toward B, the sun appears to move toward H.  If we had observed the sun rise on the 20th of August, 1876, we  should have seen it rise a little before Regulus, and a little  south of it, in such a relation as circle 1 is to the star in Fig.  43. By sunset the earth had moved enough to make the sun appear  to be at circle 2, and by the next morning at circle 3, at which  time Regulus would rise before the sun. Thus the earth's motion  seems to make the sun traverse a regular circle among the stars  once a year: but it is not the sun that moves.    [Illustration: Fig. 43.]    There are certain stars that have such irregular, uncertain, vagarious  ways that they were called vagabonds, or planets, by the early  astronomers. Here is the path of Jupiter in the year 1866 (Fig.  44). These bodies go forward for awhile, then stop, start aside,  then retrograde, [Page 112] and go on again. Some are never seen far  from the sun, and others in all parts of the ecliptic.    [Illustration: Fig. 44.]    First see them as they stand to-day, as in Fig. 45. The observer  stands on the earth at A. It has rolled over so far that he cannot  see the sun; it has set. But Venus is still in sight; Jupiter is  45 deg. behind Venus, and Saturn is seen 90 deg. farther east. When A has  rolled a little farther, if he is awake, he will see Mars before  he sees the sun; or, in common language, Venus will set after,  and Mars rise before the sun. All these bodies at near and far  distances seem set in the starry dome, as the different stars seem  in Fig. 42, p. 110.    [Illustration: Fig. 45. Showing Position of Planets.]    The mysterious movements of advance and retreat are rendered  intelligible by Fig. 46. The planet Mercury is at A, and, seen from  the earth, B is located at _a_, [Page 113] on the background of the  stars it seems to be among. It remains apparently stationary at _a_  for some time, because approaching the earth in nearly a straight  line. Passing D to C, it appears to retrograde among the stars to  _c_; remains apparently stationary for some time, then, in passing  from C to E and A, appears to pass back among the stars to _a_. The  progress of the earth, meanwhile, although it greatly retards the  apparent motion from A to C, greatly hastens it from C to A.    [Illustration: Fig. 46.--Apparent Movements of an Inferior Planet.]    It is also apparent that Mercury and Venus, seen from the earth,  can never appear far from the sun. They must be just behind the  sun as evening stars, or just before it as heralds of the morning.  Venus is never more than 47 deg. from the sun, and Mercury never more  than 30 deg.; indeed, it keeps so near the sun that very few people  have ever seen the brilliant sparkler. Observe how much larger the  planet appears near the earth in conjunction at D than in opposition  at E. Observe also what phases it must present, and how transits  sometimes take place.    [Page 114]  The movement of a superior planet, one whose orbit is exterior  to the earth, is clear from Fig. 47. When the earth is at A and  Mars at B, it will appear among the stars at C. When the earth is  at D, Mars having moved more slowly to E, will have retrograded  to F. It remains there while the earth passes on, in a line nearly  straight, from Mars to G; then, as the earth begins to curve around  the sun, Mars will appear to retraverse the distance from F to  C, and beyond. The farther the superior planet is from the earth  the less will be the retrograde movement.    [Illustration: Fig. 47.--Illustrating Movements of a Superior Planet.]    The reader should draw the orbits in proportion, and, remembering  the relative speed of each planet, note the movement of each in  different parts of their orbits.    To account for these most simple movements, the earlier astronomers  invented the most complex and impossible machinery. They thought the  earth the centre, and that the sun, moon, and stars were carried  about it, as stoves around a person to warm him. They thought these  strange movements of the planets were accomplished by mounting them  on subsidiary eccentric wheels in the revolving crystal sphere.  All that was [Page 115] needed to give them a right conception was a  sinking of their world and themselves to an appropriate proportion,  and an enlargement of their vision, to take in from an exalted  stand-point a view of the simplicity of the perfect plan.    EXPERIMENTS.    Fix a rod, or tube, or telescope pointing at a star in the cast  or west, and the earth's revolution will be apparent in a moment,  turning the tube away from the star. Point it at stars about the  north pole, and those on one side will be found going in an opposite  direction from those on the other, and very much slower than those  about the equator. Anyone can try the pendulum experiment who has  access to some lofty place from which to suspend the ball. It was  tried in Bunker Hill Monument a few years ago, and is to be tried  in Paris, in the summer of 1879, with a seven-hundred-pound pendulum  and a suspending wire seventy yards long. The advance and retrograde  movements of planets can be illustrated by two persons walking  around a centre and noticing the place where the person appears  projected on the wall beyond.           *       *       *       *       *      PROCESSION OF STARS AND SOULS.      \"I stood upon the open casement,       And looked upon the night,     And saw the westward-going stars       Pass slowly out of sight.      \"Slowly the bright procession       Went down the gleaming arch,     And my soul discerned the music       Of the long triumphal march;      \"Till the great celestial army,       Stretching far beyond the poles,     Became the eternal symbol       Of the mighty march of souls.

Those on one side of this  line are seen in foreshortened perspective. Those furthest from  the centre, other things being equal, appear longest. The centre,  called the radiant point, of these November meteors is situated  in Leo; that of the August meteors in Perseus. Over fifty such  radiant points have been discovered.

They are of various  densities, from a cloudlet of rarest gas to solid rock; of various  sizes, from a grain's weight to little worlds; of various relations  to each other, from independent individuality to related streams  millions of miles long. When they become visible they are called  shooting-stars, which are evanescent star-points darting through  the upper air, leaving for an instant a brilliant train; meteors,  sudden lights, having a discernible diameter, passing over a large  extent of country, often exploding with violence (Fig. 48), and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15625"],[0,"The Lookout Man (#16)"],[1,"kground.    Jack wanted to climb up there and shake her out of her frivolity.  Which was strange when you consider that all his life, until three  months ago, he had lived in the midst of just such unthinking  flippancy, had been a part of it and had considered--as much as he  ever considered anything--that it was the only life worth living.    He went around the little rock pinnacle and stood looking somberly  down at the devastation that was being wrought, with no greater  beginning, probably, than a dropped match or cigarette stub. He was  thinking hazily that so his old life had been swept away in the  devastating effect of a passing whim, a foolish bit of play. The girl  irritated him with her chatter--yet three months ago he himself would  have considered it brilliant conversation, and would have exerted  himself to keep pace with her.    \"Listen!\" she cried suddenly, and Jack turned his head quickly before  he remembered that the word had come to mean nothing more than a  superfluous ejaculation hung, like a bangle on a bracelet, to the  sentences of modern youth. \"Listen, it's going to be dark before that  fire burns itself out of the way. How am I going to get home? Which  way would be best to go around it, do you think?\"    \"No way at all,\" Jack replied shortly. \"You can't go home.\"    \"Why, forevermore! I'll have to go somewhere else, then--to some farm  house where I can phone. Kate would be simply wild if--\"    \"Forget the farm house stuff. There aren't any such trimmings to these  mountains. The next farm house is down around Keddie, somewhere.  Through the woods, and mountain all the way.\" He said it rather  crossly, for his nerves were what he called edgy, and the girl still  irritated him.    \"Well, what do you know about that?\"    He had known she would say that. Cross between a peacock and a parrot,  she must be, he thought vindictively. It was maddening that she would  not--could not, perhaps?--live up to that goddess-on-the-mountain-top  look she had sometimes.    \"I don't know anything about it except that it's hard luck for us  both.\"    \"Well, what--?\" She paused in the act of putting away her  first-aid-to-the-complexion implements, and looked at him with her  wide, purple eyes. \"Why, you cross, mean, little stingy boy, you! You  can have your old peak then. I'll go down and jump in the lake.\" She  began to climb down from the little pinnacle quite as if she meant to  do exactly as she said.    \"Aw, come out of it!\" Jack tried not to turn and look at her  anxiously, but he was a human being.    \"I'm not in it--yet,\" Marion retorted with dark meaning, and jumped to  the ground.    \"Hey! you wanta break a leg?\" He swung toward her.    \"Just to spite you, I wouldn't mind. Only you'd throw me down there  amongst all those rocks and trees and make it my neck. Oh, would you  look at that!\"    \"That\" happened to be Mount Lassen, belching forth a stupendous column  of ashes and smoke. Up, up, up it went, as though it meant to go on  and on into infinity. Jack had seen it too often to be affected as he  had been that first night. He looked at Marion instead. She was  standing with her hands clinched by her side, and her breath sucking  in. As the black column mounted higher and higher, she lifted herself  to her toes, posing there absolutely unconscious of herself. Jack saw  her face grow pale; saw her eyes darken and glow with inner  excitement. She was once more the goddess on the mountain top, gazing  down at one of the wonders she had wrought. It was as though she  pulled that black column up and up and up with the tensity of her  desire.    The column mushroomed suddenly, rolling out in great, puffy billows  before it dipped and went streaming away on the wind. The mountain  beneath it spewed sluggish masses of vapor and ashes up into the black  moil above, until the whole mountain was obscured and only an angry,  rolling cloud churning lumpishly there, told what was hidden beneath.    Marion relaxed, took a long, deep breath and settled again to her trim  heels. She was not filled with terror as Jack had been; though that  may have been because she was not cast up here like a piece of  driftwood out of her world, nor was she alone. But Jack paid her the  tribute of bowing mentally before her splendid courage. She gazed a  while longer, awed ecstasy in her face. Then slowly she swung and  stared at that other churning cloud behind her--the crimsoned-tinted  cloud of destruction. She flung out both arms impulsively.    \"Oh, you world!\" she cried adoringly, unafraid yet worshipping. \"I'd  like to be the wind, so I could touch you and kiss you and beat you,  and make you love me the way I love you! I'd rather be a tree and grow  up here and swing my branches in the wind and then burn, than be a  little petty, piffling human being--I would! I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't make me afraid of you. You can storm and rage around all  you like. I only love you for it--you beautiful thing!\"    It made Jack feel as though he had blundered upon a person kneeling in  prayer; she was, after all, the goddess she looked, he thought  whimsically. At least she had all the makings of a goddess of the  mountain top. He felt suddenly inferior and gross, and he turned to  leave her alone with her beautiful, terrible world. But manlike he did  a frightfully human and earthly thing; he knocked his foot against an  empty coal-oil can, and stood betrayed in his purpose of flight.    She turned her head and looked at him like one just waking from a  too-vivid dream. She frowned, and then she smiled with a little  ironical twist to her soft curving lips.    \"You heard what I said about piffling human beings?\" she asked him  sweetly. \"That is your catalogue number. Why for goodness' sake! With  your hair done in that marcelle pompadour, and that grin, you look  exactly like Jack Corey, that Los Angeles boy that all the girls were  simply crazy about, till he turned out to be such a perfectly terrible  villain!\"          CHAPTER ELEVEN    SYMPATHY AND ADVICE      Every bit of color was swept from Jack's face, save the black of his  lashes and eyebrows and the brown of his eyes that looked at her in  startled self-betrayal. He saw the consternation flash into her face  when she first understood how truly her random shot had hit the mark,  and he dropped upon the bench by the doorway and buried his face in  his shaking hands. But youth does not suffer without making some  struggle against the pain. Suddenly he lifted his head and looked at  her with passionate resentment.    \"Well, why don't you run and tell?\" he cried harshly. \"There's the  telephone in there. Why don't you call up the office and have them  send the sheriff hot-footing it up here? If Jack Corey's such a  villain, why don't you do something about it? For the Lord's sake  don't stand there looking at me as if I'm going to swallow you whole!  Get somebody on the phone, and then beat it before I cut loose and be  the perfectly awful villain you think I am!\"    Marion took a startled step away from him, turned and came  hesitatingly toward him. And as she advanced she smiled a little  ostentatiously whimsical smile and touched the butt of her  six-shooter.    \"I'm heeled, so I should be agitated,\" she said flippantly. \"I always  was crazy to get the inside dope on that affair. Tell me. Were you  boys honest-to-goodness bandits, or what?\"    \"What, mostly.\" Jack gave her a sullen, upward glance from under his  eyebrows. \"Go ahead and play at cat-and-mouse, if you want to.  Nobody'll stop you, I guess. Have all the fun you want--you're getting  it cheap enough; cheaper by a darned sight than you'll get the inside  dope you're crazy for.\"    \"_What_ do you _know_ about it!--me running on to Jack Corey, away up  here on the top of the world!\" But it was hard to be flippant while  she looked down into that stricken young face of his, and saw the  white line around his lips that ought to be smiling at life; saw, too,  the trembling of his bruised hands, that he tried so hard to hold  steady. She came still closer; so close that she could have touched  his arm.    \"It was the papers called you such awful things. I didn't,\" she said,  wistfully defensive. \"I couldn't--not after seeing you on the beach  that day, playing around like a great big kid, and not making eyes at  the girls when they made eyes at you. You--you didn't act like a  villain, when I saw you. You acted like a big boy that likes to have  fun--oh, just oodles of fun, but hasn't got a mean hair in his head. I  know; I watched you and the fellows you were with. I was up on the  pier looking down at you whooping around in the surf. And next day,  when the girls at the Martha Washington read about it in the papers, I  just couldn't believe it was true, what they said about you boys being  organized into bandits and all that, and leading a double life and  everything.    \"But it did look bad when you beat it--about two jumps ahead of the  police, at that. You see Fred was along with the man that was shot,  and being in the garage and around automobiles all the time, he  thought to read the number of your car, and remembered it; near enough  anyway, so that he knew for sure it was the Singleton Corey car by the  make and general appearance of it, and identified it positively when  he saw it in your garage. And that did make it look bad!\"    \"What did mother do when they--?\" Jack did not look up while he  stammered the question that had been three months feeding his  imagination with horrors.    \"Why, she didn't do anything. She went right away, that very morning,  to a sanitarium and would not see anybody but her own private nurse  and her own private doctor. They gave out bulletins about how she  slept and what she had for breakfast, and all that. But, believe me,  brother, they didn't get any dope from her! She just simply would not  be interviewed!\"    Jack let out a long breath and sat up. At"]]]
