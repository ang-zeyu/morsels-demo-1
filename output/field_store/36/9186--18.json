I have so  bad a name that no one will trust me. What can I do to win back the  respect of the community and earn a square meal? Ah, I have it! I will  turn pious and go upon a pilgrimage. That ought to make me popular once  more.\"    So the Fox started upon the pilgrimage. She had not gone very far when  she met a Cock, but he knew the character of Madame Fox too well to  trust himself near. He flew up into a tree, and from that safe perch  crowed jauntily, \"Good morning, Madame Fox. Whither away so fast?\"    The Fox drew down the corners of her mouth, trying to look pious, and  rolled up her eyes as she answered in a hollow voice, \"Oh, Master Cock,  I am going on a pious pilgrimage. I am sorry for my wicked life, and now  I am going to be good.\"    \"Ah,\" said the Cock, \"I am indeed glad to hear that! Going on a  pilgrimage, are you? Well, in that case I will go with you.\"    \"Do, Master Cock, do,\" answered the Fox fervently. \"It will do you good.  Come sit upon my broad back and I will carry you.\"    The Cock thanked her and climbed upon her back, and so they proceeded on  their pilgrimage together. After a while they came upon a Dove, which  fluttered away hastily when she saw old Lady Fox, knowing too well her  wicked tricks. But the Fox called to her in a gentle voice:--    \"Do not be afraid, O Dove. I know why you start at my approach. But I  have repented of my former sins and have turned pilgrim. My friend, the  Cock, and I have just started upon our pious journey. Will you join us?\"    When the innocent Dove saw the Cock upon the Fox's back she thought that  certainly everything must be safe, so she answered:--    \"Yes, Madame Fox, I will go with you.\"    \"Jump right up on my back; there is plenty of room beside the Cock,\"  said the Fox cordially.    A little further on they met a wild Duck, who waddled away quacking  wildly when he saw the Fox trotting towards him. But the sly old lady  called out to him, smiling:--    \"Be calm, little brother. I have given up my former unkind tricks, for  which I sadly repent, and now I am going on a pious pilgrimage. See,  your friends the Cock and the Dove are my companions.\"    \"In that case I will go along, too,\" said the Duck, \"for you have a  goodly party.\"    \"That is right,\" replied the Fox approvingly. \"I thought you would go.  Kindly take a back seat with the others.\"    Now when these queer pilgrims had traveled for some time they came to a  cave in the rocks, a deep dark cave which looked like a den. And here  the Fox stopped, saying:--    \"Dear brothers, it is time that we paused and thought more carefully  about our sins. We must cross seas and rivers, and Heaven knows when we  shall reach the end of our journey. Let us listen to one another's  confessions, for I am sure we have all been miserable sinners. Come, Mr.  Cock, come into the cave with me and I will hear you first.\"    The Cock followed her into the cave, saying with some surprise, \"Why,  Madame Fox, what have I done that is wicked?\"    \"Do you not know?\" answered the Fox sternly. \"Why, do you not begin to  crow at midnight and wake poor tired people out of their first sleep? Go  to! You ought to be ashamed! Then again you crow at the most  inconveniently early hour in the morning and make the caravans mistake  the true time, so that they start upon their journeys long before the  proper hour and fall into the hands of robbers who prowl about before  light. These are dreadful sins, Mr. Cock, and you deserve to be  punished.\" So the wicked old Fox seized the Cock and ate him all up.    After the Fox had finished him she came to the entrance of the cave and  called, \"Now you come, little Dove, and tell me what you have done that  is naughty.\"    \"But I have done nothing,\" said the innocent Dove, wondering very much;  \"of what evil do you accuse me, Madame Fox?\"    \"When the farmers sow their grain you dig up the yellow kernels and eat  them for your dinner. That is stealing, which is a wicked, wicked sin,  and must be severely punished,\" cried the hungry Fox. And thereupon she  seized the poor little Dove and ate her up.    Once more the Fox stood at the door of the cave, stealthily licking her  chops, and she called out to the Duck, \"Come in, Mr. Duck, and I will  hear what you have to say.\"    \"Well, I have not done anything wrong,\" said the Duck positively, \"and  you cannot say that I have; can you now, Madame Fox?\"    \"Oh, indeed and indeed!\" exclaimed the Fox. \"Have you not stolen the  king's gold crown, and do you not wear it on your head, you wicked  creature?\"    \"Indeed and indeed I have done no such thing. It is not true, Madame  Fox, as I can prove. Wait a bit and I will bring witnesses.\"    So the Duck went out and flew up and down in front of the cave, waiting.  Presently along came a Hunter with a gun, who espied the Duck and aimed  the weapon at him.    \"Don't shoot me,\" cried the Duck. \"What have you against me, O Hunter? I  can tell you where to find worthier game. Come with me and I will show  you a wicked old Fox who eats innocent birds.\"    \"Very well,\" said the Hunter, putting up his gun, \"show me the place and  I will spare you.\"    The Duck led him softly to the entrance of the cave, and pausing there  cried out to the Fox inside, \"Come out, Madame Fox, I have brought the  witness.\"    \"Let him come in, let him come in!\" cried the Fox, for she had grown  very hungry indeed and hoped for a double meal.    \"No indeed,\" answered the Duck; \"he insists that you must come out.\" So  the Fox crept stealthily to the door, but as soon as she popped out her  wicked old head the Hunter was ready for her, and Bang! That was the end  of the Fox's pilgrimage.    The Duck also had had enough of being a pilgrim. He went home with the  Hunter and became a tame Duck, and lived happily ever after on the pond  near the Hunter's house.          THE GROUND-PIGEON      Once upon a time there was a little Malay maiden who lived in the forest  with her father and mother and baby sister. They dwelt very happily  together, until one day Coora's father decided to clear the ground on  the edge of the forest and have a rice plantation, as many of his  neighbors were doing.    So one morning early after breakfast he started out with his axe on his  shoulder to cut down the trees and make a clearing.    \"O Father, let me go with you!\" begged Coora. \"I do so want to see the  plantation grow from the very beginning.\"    But her father said No, she must stay at home until the trees were  felled.    \"And after that may I go with you?\" asked Coora. And her father promised  that it should be so.    The days went by and at last the trees were all felled in the clearing.  When Coora heard this she jumped up and down on her little bare brown  feet until her anklets tinkled, and cried, \"O Father! Now I may go with  you to the clearing, may I not? For so you promised.\"    But again her father shook his head and said, \"No, Coora, not yet. You  must wait until the fallen timber has been burned off. Then you shall go  with your mother and me to the planting of the rice.\"    Coora was very much disappointed, and the big tears stood in her eyes.  But she only said, \"Do you promise that I may help plant the rice,  really and truly?\"    And he called back over his shoulder, \"I promise!\"    At last the fallen timber was burned away, and the ground was ready for  planting. One morning Coora saw her father and mother making ready to go  out together. \"Oh, where are you going, Father and Mother?\" she asked.    \"We go to the planting of the rice,\" answered her father, slinging a big  bag over his shoulder.    \"But you promised that I should go with you when that time came?\" cried  Coora wistfully. \"Please, please may I not be your little helper?\"    \"No, no, Coora,\" answered her mother impatiently. \"Do not tease us so.  You must stay at home to take care of your little sister. Be a good  girl this time, and when the rice is well grown we will all go together  and harvest it. That will be great fun!\"    \"Shall I really go? Do you promise, Mother?\" asked poor Coora hopefully,  for she felt sure that her mother would not deceive her.    \"I promise,\" said the mother, not looking her in the eyes; and the  parents went away through the forest to plant the rice.    Time went by until the rice had grown tall and was ready for the  harvest. Now Coora heard her parents talking of the matter, and she was  very gay, for now she expected a happy, happy day. She dressed herself  and made ready to go to the harvesting, as her parents had promised. But  when she joined them, smiling joyfully, they turned upon her frowning  and bade her return to the house and take care of everything until their  home-coming. Then poor little Coora burst into tears and said, \"O my  Father and O my Mother, I have obeyed you without a word every time you  broke your promise to me. And still you continue to put me off from day  to day, when this is the thing I long to do so much that it seems as if  my heart would break. Think of it! The clearing has been made, the  timber burned, the rice planted and grown, and now it is ready for the  harvest. But I have not even seen the place where all this has  happened. O Father and Mother, why are you so unkind to me?\"    \"There, there!\" cried her father and mother together, \"do not make a  fuss over so small a matter. You cannot go to-day; but wait until the  rice is gathered and it is time to tread it out. Then we will let you  help us, you may be sure. We promise, Coora, that you shall really and  truly go.\"    \"You promise!\" echoed Coora bitterly. \"You have promised me before and  nothing came of it.\" But even while she spoke the unkind parents were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16145"],[0,"Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West and Western Australia, (#16)"],[1," of anxiety we were in sleep did not visit our eyes.  This was the first time since I had been out that I had slept so near the  men as to be able to overhear their conversation; but the rain forced us  all to seek the shelter of the same little hut, and I thus gathered the  different stories that they narrated to one another. Their speculations  and conjectures naturally ran upon our absent comrades; some imagined  that they were within a day or two's march of us, but another party held  firmly to the opinion that we should never see them more.    SUPERSTITIONS OF MY MEN.    They could give no apparently satisfactory reason for holding this  opinion, and, as there was evidently some deep mystery connected with it,  I kept on pressing my servant Coles in order to induce him to tell me  whence it arose. At last it came out that Mr. Walker had had a dream,  when we were on the shores of Shark Bay and before we had commenced our  return home, that some dreadful misfortune had befallen us and that Mr.  Smith, Thomas Ruston, and he himself, were endeavouring to make the Isle  of France in a boat, when Mr. Smith died, and the remaining two had eaten  his body. Mr. Walker had, with the utmost imprudence, related this dream  to some of the men, and they, with that superstition which is so common  amongst sailors and Englishmen of the lower orders, had attached a great  degree of importance to it; many circumstances which had hitherto been  unexplained to me now flashed upon my mind; poor Mr. Smith had been very  ill at the time Mr. Walker had related this inauspicious dream, and at  that period an extraordinary degree of despondency had crept over him, so  much so that some of the men imagined he had become deranged. When also  we were working our way down the eastern coast of Shark Bay in the boats  others of the party had got into a very desponding state, one of whom,  Henry Woods, had even gone so far as to tell me when I remonstrated with  him on this point that he knew that the greater part of us wore doomed,  and that our lives were worth nothing.    My anxiety for those I had left behind me now increased, and about an  hour and a half before daylight I started for Perth with Imbat, leaving  the others to follow as rapidly as they could, and telling them that I  would have food ready for them at Williams's cottage, who was the settler  living farthest north from Perth. In about an hour and a half I reached  Williams's hut, which I entered, and found his wife and another woman at  breakfast.    I had often got a drink of milk at this cottage when I had before been at  Perth, and I flattered myself that Mrs. Williams would recollect me;  little calculating how strangely want and suffering had changed my  appearance. The two women only stared with the utmost surprise and said,  \"Why, Magic, what's the matter with you?\" (They alluded to a crazy Malay  who used to visit the outsettler's houses, and who had somehow or the  other acquired the nickname of Magic.) I was rather hurt at my reception  and said, \"I am not Magic;\" at this they both burst into a roar of  laughter and Mrs. Williams said, \"Well, then, my good man, who are you?\"  \"One who is almost starved,\" was my reply. \"Will you take this then,\"  said my hostess, handing me a cup of tea she was raising to her lips.  \"With all my heart and soul, and God reward you for it,\" was my answer,  and I swallowed the delicious draught. Imbat, who had been to search for  Williams, now came in and explained who I was; in a few minutes more I  was seated at a comfortable breakfast; water was put on to boil, and by  the time the things were prepared the rest of the party came up.    ARRIVAL AND RECEPTION AT PERTH. NOT RECOGNIZED BY MY FRIENDS.    I now washed and made myself as clean as possible. I could obtain no  conveyance to take us on to Perth and therefore started to walk in with  Imbat, leaving the others to complete their breakfast; but I soon found  myself dreadfully ill from having eaten too profusely; still I pushed on  as well as I could, and in about an hour and a half reached the house of  my friend, L. Samson, Esquire. He could not believe it was me whom he  beheld, but having convinced himself of the fact he made me swallow about  a tea-spoonful of brandy, and, recruited by this, I was sufficiently  recovered to wait upon His Excellency the Governor in order to have  immediate steps taken to send off a party in search of my missing  comrades.    The Governor could scarcely credit his sight when he beheld the miserable  object that stood before him; but in this as in all other instances in  which I have known him the goodness of his heart shone conspicuous; not  only was every kindness shown me but immediate steps were taken to  forward assistance to those who were still in the bush. Having thus far  performed my duty I retired to press a bed once more, having for nearly  three consecutive months slept in the open air, on the ground just at the  spot where my day's hardship had terminated. So changed was I that those  of my friends who had heard of my arrival and were coming to congratulate  me passed me in the street, whilst others to whom I went up and held out  my hand drew back in horror and said, \"I beg your pardon, who are you?\"    Ere I was in bed the remainder of the men who were journeying with me  arrived, and it had thus pleased Providence to conduct six of us through  great suffering and want to the termination of our miseries.      CHAPTER 5. FROM WATER PEAK TO PERTH.    (MR. WALKER'S PARTY.)    PARTY SENT IN SEARCH FROM PERTH.    I arrived at Perth on the 21st of April and not a moment was lost in  preparing a party to go in search of the men I had left with Mr. Walker,  and who, it will be recollected, were instructed to proceed along the  coast until they made the Moore River, where assistance was to be sent  out to them from Perth.    SEARCH FOR THE OTHER PARTY.    Accordingly on the 23rd of April Lieutenant Mortimer of the 21st regiment  and Mr. Spofforth, with four soldiers, left Perth and arrived on the  Moore River in two days; but after traversing its banks in vain for two  days more they abandoned all hope of finding those they were in search of  there, and pursued a straight course about 25 miles further north, when  they fell in with another river where they formed a depot, and detours  were made in various directions for several days without any avail.    RETURN WITH CHARLES WOODS.    At length, on one of these excursions, the seaman Charles Woods, one of  my party, was found by Mr. Spofforth, lying on the beach, wrapped in his  blanket and fast asleep. He soon awoke and was not a little delighted to  recognise Mr. Spofforth whom he had seen before at Fremantle. By the  account Woods gave it appears that from the period of my departure much  disorder and discontent at the direction of their course prevailed among  the men. They frequently left the beach and wandered inland to procure  water and food, not sufficiently exerting themselves to advance  southward. They had succeeded, he said, in procuring upon the whole about  a dozen birds, a crab, and eighteen fish. On the 21st of April Mr.  Walker, who had frequently exerted himself in procuring firewood and  water for the weaker of the party, divided two dough cakes still  remaining in his possession among them all. They were then upon the  beach, and though still at a great distance from the appointed place of  rendezvous the men were very unwilling to distress themselves to reach  it, being persuaded they should be tracked, wherever they might be, by  the natives whom I should send to their help. Woods, being dissatisfied  with their slow progress, now quitted them at a place where, he says,  they had to go round two very deep bays close together, which took him a  whole day; and it was owing to his having obeyed my instructions more  strictly than the others that he was found by Mr. Spofforth. Woods, who  seemed to have a singularly accurate idea of the distance he was from  Perth when found, added that he thought he could have walked to it had he  not been discovered, although he had nothing to eat but a few native  figs; and that he thought the whole of the party were getting more  accustomed to native food and were latterly better than they had been at  first; he said he felt so himself.    SECOND PARTY IN SEARCH, UNDER MR. ROE.    Lieutenant Mortimer's party, having made every exertion but in vain to  find the five remaining persons, were compelled at the end of a fortnight  by want of provisions to return to Perth, where they arrived on the 6th  of May; and early the next morning the Surveyor-General, Mr. Roe,  accompanied by Mr. Spofforth (who again volunteered his services) four  men, and two native youths, with five horses, set out in search of those  still missing.    ARRIVAL OF MR. WALKER AT PERTH. JOURNAL OF MR. WALKER'S PARTY.    On the 9th of May, two days after the departure of Mr. Roe's party, Mr.  Walker came into Perth alone, and from his statement, together with what  was gleaned subsequently from the other men, I shall here briefly narrate  what befel them after my departure on the 10th of April.    NARRATIVE OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS FROM WATER PEAK.    On the next day they started at dawn and soon came to a great deal of  scrub; this was the belt of thick wood mentioned in my journal. Mr.  Walker says the men, being disheartened at this, they went down to the  beach and halted about a mile from it; Water Peak Hill being distant  about fifteen miles. Woods said much discontent was caused amongst the  men by its being conceived that they were following a bad course; or,  according to Ruston's expression, that \"the steering was very bad.\"    April 12.    They found a river with pools of water in coarse gravel in which they  caught here two small fish, and travelled six miles through the scrub  along a native path.    April 13.    They started and went down towards"]]]
