This is the scheme of evolution appointed for man at the present  stage--that he shall develop by descending into grosser matter, and then  ascend to carry back into himself the result of the experiences so  obtained. His real life, therefore, covers millions of years, and what we  are in the habit of calling a life is only one day of this greater  existence. Indeed, it is in reality only a small part of one day; for a  life of seventy years in the physical world is often succeeded by a period  of twenty times that length spent in higher spheres.    Every one of us has a long line of these physical lives behind him, and the  ordinary man has a fairly long line still in front of him. Each of such  lives is a day at school. The ego puts upon himself his garment of flesh  and goes forth into the school of the physical world to learn certain  lessons. He learns them, or does not learn them, or partially learns them,  as the case may be, during his schoolday of earth-life; then he lays aside  the vesture of the flesh and returns home to his own level for rest and  refreshment. In the morning of each new life he takes up again his lesson  at the point where he left it the night before. Some lessons he may be able  to learn in one day, while others may take him many days.    If he is an apt pupil and learns quickly what is needed, if he obtains an  intelligent grasp of the rules of the school, and takes the trouble to  adapt his conduct to them, his school-life is comparatively short, and when  it is over he goes forth fully equipped into the real life of the higher  worlds for which all this is only a preparation. Other egos are duller boys  who do not learn so quickly; some of them do not understand the rules of  the school, and through that ignorance are constantly breaking them; others  are wayward, and even when they see the rules they cannot at once bring  themselves to act in harmony with them. All of these have a longer  school-life, and by their own actions they delay their entry upon the real  life of the higher worlds.    For this is a school in which no pupil ever fails; every one must go on to  the end. He has no choice as to that; but the length of time which he will  take in qualifying himself for the higher examinations is left entirely to  his own discretion. The wise pupil, seeing that school-life is not a thing  in itself, but only a preparation for a more glorious and far wider life,  endeavours to comprehend as fully as possible the rules of his school, and  shapes his life in accordance with them as closely as he can, so that no  time may be lost in the learning of whatever lessons are necessary. He  co-operates intelligently with the Teachers, and sets himself to do the  maximum of work which is possible for him, in order that as soon as he can  he may come of age and enter into his kingdom as a glorified ego.    Theosophy explains to us the laws under which this school-life must be  lived, and in that way gives a great advantage to its students. The first  great law is that of evolution. Every man has to become a perfect man, to  unfold to the fullest degree the divine possibilities which lie latent  within him, for that unfoldment is the object of the entire scheme so far  as he is concerned. This law of evolution steadily presses him onward to  higher and higher achievements. The wise man tries to anticipate its  demands--to run ahead of the necessary curriculum, for in that way he not  only avoids all collision with it, but he obtains the maximum of assistance  from its action. The man who lags behind in the race of life finds its  steady pressure constantly constraining him--a pressure which, if resisted,  rapidly becomes painful. Thus the laggard on the path of evolution has  always the sense of being hunted and driven by his fate, while the man who  intelligently co-operates is left perfectly free to choose the direction in  which he shall move, so long as it is onward and upward.    The second great law under which this evolution is taking place is the law  of cause and effect. There can be no effect without its cause, and every  cause must produce its effect. They are in fact not two but one, for the  effect is really part of the cause, and he who sets one in motion sets the  other also. There is in Nature no such idea as that of reward or  punishment, but only of cause and effect. Anyone can see this in connection  with mechanics or chemistry; the clairvoyant sees it equally clearly with  regard to the problems of evolution. The same law obtains in the higher as  in the lower worlds; there, as here, the angle of reflection is always  equal to the angle of incidence. It is a law of mechanics that action and  reaction are equal and opposite. In the almost infinitely finer matter of  the higher worlds the reaction is by no means always instantaneous; it may  sometimes be spread over long periods of time, but it returns inevitably  and exactly.    Just as certain in its working as the mechanical law in the physical world  is the higher law, according to which the man who sends out a good thought  or does a good action receives good in return, while the man who sends out  an evil thought or does an evil action, receives evil in return with equal  accuracy--once more, not in the least a reward or punishment administered  by some external will, but simply as the definite and mechanical result of  his own activity. Man has learnt to appreciate a mechanical result in the  physical world, because the reaction is usually almost immediate and can be  seen by him. He does not invariably understand the reaction in the higher  worlds because that takes a wider sweep, and often returns not in this  physical life, but in some future one.    The action of this law affords the explanation of a number of the problems  of ordinary life. It accounts for the different destinies imposed upon  people, and also for the differences in the people themselves. If one man  is clever in a certain direction and another is stupid, it is because in a  previous life the clever man has devoted much effort to practise in that  particular direction, while the stupid man is trying it for the first time.  The genius and the precocious child are examples not of the favouritism of  some deity but of the result produced by previous lives of application. All  the varied circumstances which surrounded us are the result of our own  actions in the past, precisely as are the qualities of which we find  ourselves in possession. We are what we have made ourselves, and our  circumstances are such as we have deserved.    There is, however, a certain adjustment or apportionment of these effects.  Though the law is a natural law and mechanical in its operation, there are  nevertheless certain great Angels who are concerned with its  administration. They cannot change by one feather-weight the amount of the  result which follows upon any given thought or act, but they can within  certain limits expedite or delay its action, and decide what form it shall  take.    If this were not done there would be at least a possibility that in his  earlier stages the man might blunder so seriously that the results of his  blundering might be more than he could bear. The plan of the Deity is to  give man a limited amount of free-will; if he uses that small amount well,  he earns the right to a little more next time; if he uses it badly,  suffering comes upon him as the result of such evil use, and he finds  himself restrained by the result of his previous actions. As the man learns  how to use his free-will, more and more of it is entrusted to him, so that  he can acquire for himself practically unbounded freedom in the direction  of good, but his power to do wrong is strictly restricted. He can progress  as rapidly as he will, but he cannot wreck his life in his ignorance. In  the earlier stages of the savage life of primitive man it is natural that  there should be on the whole more of evil than of good, and if the entire  result of his actions came at once upon a man as yet so little developed,  it might well crush the newly evolved powers which are still so feeble.    Besides this, the effects of his actions are varied in character. While  some of them produce immediate results, others need much more time for  their action, and so it comes to pass that as the man develops he has above  him a hovering cloud of undischarged results, some of them good, some of  them bad. Out of this mass (which we may regard for purposes of analogy  much as though it were a debt owing to the powers of Nature) a certain  amount falls due in each of his successive births; and that amount, so  assigned, may be thought of as the man's destiny for that particular life.    All that it means is that a certain amount of joy and a certain amount of  suffering are due to him, and will unavoidably happen to him; how he will  meet this destiny and what use he will make of it, that is left entirely to  his own option. It is a certain amount of force which has to work itself  out. Nothing can prevent the action of that force, but its action may  always be modified by the application of a new force in another direction,  just as is the case in mechanics. The result of past evil is like any other  debt; it may be paid in one large cheque upon the bank of life--by some one  supreme catastrophe; or it may be paid in a number of smaller notes, in  minor troubles and worries; in some cases it may even be paid in the small  change of a great number of petty annoyances. But one thing is quite  certain--that, in some form or other, paid it will have to be.    The conditions of our present life, then, are absolutely the result of our  own action in the past; and the other side of that statement is that our  actions in this life are building up conditions for the next one. A man who  finds himself limited either in powers or in outer circumstances may not  always be able to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12928"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 1 (#16)"],[1,"George; the remains of this crustacean were also abundant there, at  places where water had been but very temporarily lodged.*    (Footnote. A species of Astacus, which, as far as I am aware, comes very  close to the common European crayfish.)    PACK UP THE BOATS, AND CONTINUE THE JOURNEY.    We dismantled our boats, packing up the canvas, and in the hollow of a  large tree I buried my collection of geological specimens, that we might  be loaded as lightly as possible.    December 31.    Quitting this spot at seven A.M. we continued on a bearing of 20 degrees  west of north, and passed through a scrub of Acacia pendula, in which  grew some eucalypti. At two and three-quarter miles we entered on a  spacious open plain which appeared to extend westward to the river, a  distance of about two miles. We crossed the more elevated and eastern  part of this plain. We next entered a scrub of Acacia pendula, which at  seven miles opened into a forest of apple-trees and other eucalypti. We  soon after reached Maule's creek, the passage of which, on account of its  steep banks, cost us an hour and a half. This induced me to encamp there,  influenced also by the apprehension of a want of water, at any convenient  distance beyond it. On first approaching water I had frequently an  opportunity of observing that the worst characters have the least control  over their appetites, in cases of extreme privation. It was a standing  order, which I insisted on being observed, that no man should quit the  line of route to drink without my permission. There was one,  notwithstanding, who never could, in cases of extremity, resist the  temptation of water, and who would rush to it, regardless of  consequences. Now this man continued to be an irreclaimable character,  and in six years after he had lost all the advantages he gained by his  services on this occasion. The morning had been calm and very hot, but at  three P.M. the sun was obscured, to our inexpressible relief, and clouds  full of thunder at length overcast the whole sky; only a few drops of  rain fell about six P.M.; and at ten the heavens became clear, the air  however was cool and refreshing.    PASS THE WESTERN EXTREMITY OF NUNDEWAR RANGE.    January 1, 1832.    We proceeded on the same bearing, travelling over a very level surface.  As we approached the western extremity of the great range, we touched on  an open plain, whereof the soil was very rich. The greater portion of it  lay on the left, or westward of our route, or towards the river. After  crossing it we again entered a thin scrub of Acacia pendula, which having  been recently burnt was open and favourable for passing through. We  afterwards crossed a succession of gentle undulations, and through an  opening, along the bottom of one valley, I obtained a view over the flat  country to the westward. The most remarkable feature was a naked ridge of  yellowish rock which rose abruptly from the woody country, as if it  overhung the river. I wished much to examine that singular mass, but we  were proceeding with little prospect of finding water, and we had  impassable scrubs before us, as well as rocky hills on our right. A  valley at length appeared in our route, and in which from the nature of  the mountains at its head, I hoped to find water. In this I was however  disappointed, for the channel, although of considerable depth, was quite  dry, and I in vain searched its bed for at least a mile upwards. At ten  miles the most western head of the range of Nundewar bore north, its low  western extremity being distant only about a quarter of a mile. We were  about to cross some offsets from the range, when a thick scrub or brush  obstructed our further progress in that direction. I entered it and  penetrated about a mile and a half without discovering any indication of  water, or any opening through which the carts might pass. The weather was  extremely warm, and as we had come a long journey, I determined to encamp  once more on the Namoi; and turning westward I followed a line of flats  and hollows, which led me to the nearest bend of that river. We  calculated we had travelled twenty-one miles, although the distance by  latitude and angles taken on the hills is less. Thermometer 97 degrees in  the shade. Where we encamped the river was shallow, with many dead trees  in the channel; but a little lower down it formed a deep, broad, and  extensive reach. The latitude as ascertained by the stars Aldebaran and  Rigel was 30 degrees 24 minutes 44 seconds South.    January 2.    We pursued a north-west course after getting clear of the river, my  object being to keep within reach of it, if possible, in case of scarcity  of water. Yet with such a range on our right this was not much to be  apprehended; indeed, our line of exploration was as favourable as could  be wished, having a river on one hand, and a lofty range on the other;  the country between presenting no impediment to our progress northward.  At about two miles we crossed a small watercourse with some pools in it,  and half a mile further the broad bed of a river, the course of which was  towards the Namoi, but it did not contain much water. It could not be a  long river in either direction, though the width, the height of banks,  and the large water-worn stones in its bed, gave it the appearance of  being at times a considerable stream. Some caution was necessary at both  these watercourses in passing the carts over, the banks of both being  steep; we crossed them however without much delay. We next ascended, by a  gradual slope, a low ridge, which had on its summit a species of the  eucalyptus with yellow bark, presenting a striking contrast to other  trees, the line between them being also well defined. The rock consisted  of red sandstone, the first I had seen to the northward of Liverpool  range. On descending, which we did by a gentle slope, the scrub became  gradually thin, and at length opened to a clear verdant surface,  extending far to the north and west. It was now obvious that nothing  could obstruct our progress into the regions beyond the great range. On  the contrary, a beautiful open country lay at its base, reaching quite  round it to the north-east. A fresh cooling breeze from the north-west  fanned our faces as we beheld, for the first time, that fine country. The  recollection of the rocks which we had endeavoured to cross further east  perhaps heightened its beauty in our eyes, but the great range itself  formed a sublime horizon on the east, some of the summits having very  remarkably pointed or castellated forms.    UNKNOWN TREE.    One tree of an uncommon genus grew on the borders of the plain, and about  a mile to the west one solitary hill stood in this plain, like an island  in the sea. It was flat-topped, with a few trees on the summit. The  uncommon tree was covered with a yellow blossom, the leaf was dark green  and shining, and the wood was white.* The low country, which seemed most  to promise water, was still distant, while the course of the Namoi was  receding from our route as I had reason to believe from the position of  the low ridge which I had crossed. An opening in the distance westward  seemed to mark its course.    (*Footnote. See the Journal of my next Journey Chapter 2.8.)    WATER SCARCE.    I was still disposed to pursue a middle direction between the mountains  and the river (35 degrees West of North) but I bore in mind the necessity  for turning these ranges, so as to pass into that part of the country  beyond them at which we should have arrived if we had crossed them where  we first attempted, in order to determine the question as to the  existence of the large river there, as stated by The Barber.    PROVIDENTIAL SUPPLY.    A rather elevated but grassy plain afforded little prospect of water  being near at the time we were about to halt and rest, after a long  journey, and I had directed the men to pitch the tents, despairing of  reaching water that day, when I suddenly came upon a deep pool. I was  truly sensible of the goodness of Providence, considering that this was  to all appearance the only water within many miles, and on a plain where  I had no reason to expect it. I could not then see how the pond was  supplied.    CRAYFISH.    Neither was this all our good fortune, for having directed Jones (one of  the men ablest at fishing) to try the pond, to the no small amusement of  the others; he nevertheless drew out in a short time a good dish of  crayfish (or lobsters, as they termed them). We had also killed a  kangaroo that morning, which enabled us to feed our famished dogs, so  that our entry on this new region could not have been more auspicious.    TRAP-HILL ON PLAINS.    In the afternoon I walked to the isolated hill of the plain, and found  that it consisted of trap-rock, a solid mass projecting from the earth,  with little or no soil upon it. Its greater elongation extended due north  and south, conformable to the direction of most of the other summits I  had ascended. The steepest side was towards the east, and its height was  50 feet above the plain. From this hill I perceived another like it, due  south, and distant about half a mile.    The dead silence of the solitary plains around me was broken by the sound  of a distant thunderstorm which was then exhausting itself on the  Nundewar range, while the sun was setting in perfect tranquillity on the  unbroken horizon of the west. Afterwards the night was dark and stormy,  and at ten it began to rain, a circumstance rather alarming to us then,  considering the nature of the soil of these plains, which a few days'  rain must have rendered nearly impassable.    January 3.    A fine serene morning, although the eastern mountains still echoed under  clouds of thunder. We left the Lobster Pond at six, and continued our  route in the direction of 35 degrees west of north for the first twelve  miles.    CUT THROUGH A SCRUB.    Having reached, at"]]]
