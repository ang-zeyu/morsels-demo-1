Cover closely and let it cook slowly until tender--about three  hours.      PICKLED BEEF TONGUE    Select a large, fresh beef tongue. Soak in cold water one-half hour.  Crush a piece of saltpetre, size of walnut, one teacup of salt, one  teaspoon of pepper, three small cloves of garlic cut fine; mix  seasoning. Drain water off tongue. With a pointed knife prick tongue;  rub in seasoning. Put tongue in crock; add the balance of salt, etc.;  cover with plate and weight. Allow to stand from four to five days.  Without washing off the seasoning, boil in fresh water until tender.          *MEATS*      The majority of the cuts of meat which are kosher are those which  require long, slow cooking. These cuts of meat are the most nutritious  ones and by long, slow cooking can be made as acceptable as the more  expensive cuts of meat; they are best boiled or braised.    In order to shut in the juices the meat should at first be subjected to  a high degree of heat for a short time. A crust or case will then be  formed on the outside, after which the heat should be lowered and the  cooking proceed slowly.    This rule holds good for baking, where the oven must be very hot for the  first few minutes only; for boiling, where the water must be boiling and  covered for a time, and then placed where it will simmer only; for  broiling, where the meat must be placed close to the red-hot coals or  under the broiler flame of the gas stove at first, then held farther  away.    Do not pierce the meat with a fork while cooking, as it makes an outlet  for the juices. If necessary, to turn it, use two spoons.      PAN ROAST BEEF    Take a piece of cross-rib or shoulder, about two and one-half to three  pounds, put in a small frying-pan with very little fat; have the pan  very hot, let the meat brown on all sides, turning it continually until  all sides are done, which will require thirty minutes altogether. Lift  the meat out of pan to a hot platter, brown some onions, serve these  with the meat.      AN EASY POT ROAST    Take four pounds of brisket, season with salt, pepper and ginger, add  three tablespoons of tomatoes and an onion cut up. Cover with water in  an iron pot and a close-fitting cover, put in oven and bake from three  to four hours.      POT ROAST. BRAISED BEEF    Heat some fat or goose fat in a deep iron pot, cut half an onion very  fine and when it is slightly browned put in the meat. Cover up closely  and let the meat brown on all sides. Salt to taste, add a scant half  teaspoon of paprika, half a cup of hot water and simmer an hour longer,  keeping covered closely all the time. Add one-half a sweet green pepper  (seeds removed), one small carrot cut in slices, two tablespoons of  tomatoes and two onions sliced.    Two and a half pounds of brisket shoulder or any other meat suitable for  pot roasting will require three hours slow cooking. Shoulder of lamb may  also be cooked in this style.    When the meat is tender, remove to a warm platter, strain the gravy,  rubbing the thick part through the sieve and after removing any fat  serve in a sauce boat.    If any meat is left over it can be sliced and warmed over in the gravy,  but the gravy must be warmed first and the meat cook for a short time  only as it is already done enough and too much cooking will render it  tasteless.      BRISKET OF BEEF (BRUSTDECKEL)    If the brisket has been used for soup, take it out of the soup when it  is tender and prepare it with a horseradish sauce, garlic sauce or onion  sauce. (See \"Sauces for Meats\".)      BRISKET OF BEEF WITH SAUERKRAUT    Take about three pounds of fat, young beef (you may make soup stock of  it first), then take out the bones, salt it well and lay it in the  bottom of a kettle, put a quart of sauerkraut on top of it and let it  boil slowly until tender. Add vinegar if necessary, thicken with a  grated raw potato and add a little brown sugar. Some like a few caraway  seeds added.      SAUERBRATEN    Take a piece of cross-rib or middle cut of chuck about three pounds, and  put it in a deep earthen jar and pour enough boiling vinegar over it to  cover; you may take one-third water. Add to the vinegar when boiling  four bay leaves, some whole peppercorns, cloves and whole mace. Pour  this over the meat and turn it daily. In summer three days is the  longest time allowed for the meat to remain in this pickle; but in  winter eight days is not too long. When ready to boil, heat one  tablespoon drippings in a stew-pan. Cut up one or two onions in it; stew  until tender and then put in the beef, salting it on both sides before  stewing. Stew closely covered and if not acid enough add some of the  brine in which it was pickled. Stew about three hours and thicken the  gravy with flour.      ROLLED BEEF--POT-ROASTED    Take one pound and one-half of tenderloin, sprinkle it with parsley and  onion; season with pepper and salt; roll and tie it. Place it in a pan  with soup stock (or water if you have no stock), carrot and bay leaf  and pot roast for one and one-half hours. Serve with tomato or brown  sauce.      MOCK DUCK    Take the tenderloin, lay it flat on a board after removing the fat. Make  a stuffing as for poultry. See \"To Stuff Poultry\". Spread this mixture  on the meat evenly; then roll and tie it with white twine; turn in the  ends to make it even and shapely.    Cut into dice an onion, turnip, and carrot, and place them in a  baking-pan; lay the rolled meat on the bed of vegetables; pour in enough  stock or water to cover the pan one inch deep; add a bouquet made of  parsley, one bay leaf and three cloves; cover with another pan, and let  cook slowly for four hours, basting frequently. It can be done in a pot  just as well, and should be covered as tight as possible; when cooked,  strain off the vegetables; thicken the gravy with one tablespoon of  flour browned in fat and serve it with the meat. Long, slow cooking is  required to make the meat tender. If cooked too fast it will not be  good.      MARROWBONES    Have the bones cut into pieces two or three inches long; scrape and wash  them very clean; spread a little thick dough on each end to keep the  marrow in; then tie each bone in a piece of cloth and boil them for one  hour. Remove the cloth and paste, and place each bone on a square of  toast; sprinkle with red pepper and serve very hot. Or the marrow-bone  can be boiled without being cut, the marrow then removed with a spoon  and placed on squares of hot toast. Serve for luncheon.      ROAST BEEF, No. 1    Take prime rib roast. Cut up a small onion, a celery root and part of a  carrot into rather small pieces and add to these two or three sprigs of  parsley and one bay leaf. Sprinkle these over the bottom of the  dripping-pan and place your roast on this bed. The oven should be very  hot when the roast is first put in, but when the roast is browned  sufficiently to retain its juices, moderate the heat and roast more  slowly until the meat is done. Do not season until the roast is browned,  and then add salt and pepper. Enough juice and fat will drop from the  roast to give the necessary broth for basting. Baste frequently and turn  occasionally, being very careful, however, not to stick a fork into the  roast.      ROAST BEEF, No. 2    Season meat with salt and paprika. Dredge with flour. Place on rack in  dripping-pan with two or three tablespoons fat, in hot oven, to brown  quickly. Reduce heat and baste every ten minutes with the fat that has  fried out. When meat is about half done, turn it over, dredge with  flour, finish browning. If necessary, add a small quantity of water.  Allow fifteen to twenty minutes for each pound of meat.    Three pounds is the smallest roast practicable.      ROAST BEEF (RUSSIAN STYLE)    Place a piece of cross-rib or shoulder weighing three pounds in  roasting-pan, slice some onions over it, season with salt and pepper,  add some water and let it cook well. Then peel a few potatoes and put  them under the meat. When the meat becomes brown, turn it and cook until  it browns on the other side.      WIENER BRATEN--VIENNA ROAST    Take a shoulder, have the bone taken out and then pound the meat well  with a mallet. Lay it in vinegar for twenty-four hours. Heat some fat or  goose oil in a deep pan or kettle which has a cover that fits air tight  and lay the meat in the hot fat and sprinkle the upper side with salt,  pepper and ginger. Put an onion in with the meat; stick about half a  dozen cloves in the onion and add one bay leaf. Now turn the meat over  and sprinkle the other side with salt, pepper and ginger. Cut up one or  two tomatoes and pour some soup stock over all, and a dash of white  wine. Cover closely and stew very slowly for three or four hours,  turning the meat now and then; in doing so do not pierce with the fork,  as this will allow the juice to escape. Do not add any water. Make  enough potato pancakes to serve one or two to each person with \"Wiener  Braten.\"      TO BROIL STEAK BY GAS    Wipe steak with a damp cloth. Trim off the surplus fat. When the oven  has been heated for from five to seven minutes, lay steak on a rack,  greased, as near the flame as possible, the position of the rack  depending on the thickness of the steak. Let the steak sear on each  side, thereby retaining the juice. Then lower the rack somewhat, and  allow the steak to broil to the degree required. Just before taking from  the oven, salt and pepper and spread with melted chicken fat.    You can get just as good results in preparing chops and fish in the  broiling oven.      BROILED BEEFSTEAK    Heat the gridiron, put in the steak, turn the gridiron over the hot  coals at intervals of two minutes and then repeatedly at intervals of  one minute. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve on a hot platter.    Chops are done in the same way, but the gridiron is turned twice at  intervals of two minutes and six times at intervals of one minute.      FRIED STEAK"]]]
