[21] A burgess may give and sell his land and go whither he will  freely and quietly unless there be a claim against him.\"    In the boroughs, merchant and manufacturing guilds controlled  prices and assured quality. The head officer of the guild  usually controlled the borough, which excluded rival merchant  guilds. A man might belong to more than one guild, e.g. one for  his trade and another for religion.    Trades and crafts, each of which had to be licensed, grouped  together by specialty in the town. Cloth-makers, dyers, tanners,  and fullers were near an accessible supply of running water,  upon which their trade depended. Streets were often named by the  trade located there, such as Butcher Row, Pot Row, Cordwainer  Row, Ironmonger Row, Wheeler Row, and Fish Row. Hirers of labor  and sellers of wheat, hay, livestock, dairy products, apples and  wine, meat, poultry, fish and pies, timber and cloth all had a  distinct location. Some young men were apprenticed to craftsmen  to assist them and learn their craft.    The nation produced sufficient iron, but a primitive steel [iron  with carbon added] was imported. Steel was used for tools,  instruments, weapons and armor. Ships could carry about 300  people.    Plays about miracles wrought by holy men or the sufferings and  fortitude of martyrs were performed. Most nobles could read,  though writing was still a specialized craft. There were books  on animals, plants, and stones. The lives of the saints as told  in the book \"The Golden Legend\" were popular. The story of the  early King Arthur was told in the book \"The History of the Kings  of England\". The story at this time stressed Arthur as a hero  and went as follows: Arthur became King at age 15. He had an  inborn goodness and generosity as well as courage. He and his  knights won battles against foreign settlers and neighboring  clans. Once, he and his men surrounded a camp of foreigners until  they gave up their gold and silver rather than starve. Arthur  married Guenevere and established a court and retinue. Leaving  Britain in the charge of his nephew Modred, he fought battles on  the continent for land to give to his noblemen who did him  service in his household and fought with him. When Arthur  returned to Britain, he made battle with his nephew Modred who  had crowned himself King. Arthur's knight Gawain, the son of his  sister, and the enemy Modred were killed and Arthur was severely  wounded. Arthur told his kinsman Constantine to rule Britain as  King in his place.    The intellectual world included art, secular literature, law, and  medicine. There were about 90 physicians.    Forests were still retained by Kings for their hunting of boars  and stags. The bounds of the Forest were enlarged. They  comprised almost one-third of the kingdom.    Barons and their tenants and sub-tenants were offered an  alternative of paying shield money [\"scutage\"] of 26s.8d. per  fee in commutation for and instead of military service for their  fiefs. This enabled Henry to hire soldiers who would be more  directly under his own control and to organize a more efficient  army.    A substantial number of barons and monasteries were heavily in  debt to the Jews. The King taxed the Jews at will.    During rivalry for the throne after Henry I's reign, the bishops  gained some independence from the Crown and strengthened their  ties with the Pope.      The Law    Henry restored the death penalty for thievery and robbery, but  maintained William I's punishment of the mutilation of blinding  and severing of limbs for other offenses.    The forest law stated that: \"he that doth hunt a wild beast and  doth make him pant, shall pay 10 shillings: If he be a free man,  then he shall pay double. If he be a bound man, he shall lose  his skin.\" A \"verderer\" was responsible for enforcing this law,  which also stated that: \"If anyone does offer force to a  Verderer, if he be a freeman, he shall lose his freedom, and all  that he hath. And if he be a villein, he shall lose his right  hand.\" Further, \"If such an offender does offend so again, he  shall lose his life.\"    A wife's dower is one-third of all her husband's freehold land,  unless his endowment of her at their marriage was less than  one-third.    Counterfeiting law required that \"If any one be caught carrying  false coin, the reeve shall give the bad money to the King  however much there is, and it shall be charged in the render of  his farm [payment] as good, and the body of the offender shall  be handed over to the King for judgment, and the serjeants who  took him shall have his clothes.\"    Debts to townsmen were recoverable by this law: \"If a burgess has  a gage [a valuable object held as security for carrying out an  agreement] for money lent and holds this for a whole year and a  day, and the debtor will not deny the debt or deliver the gage,  and this is proved, the burgess may sell the gage before good  witnesses for as much as he can, and deduct his money from the  sum. If any money is over he shall return it to the debtor. But  if there is not enough to pay him, he shall take distress again  for the amount that is lacking.\"    Past due rent in a borough was punishable by payment of 10s. as  fine.\"    There are legal maxims which are becoming so well established and  known that there will never be a need to write them down as  statutes. As delineated by St. Germain in \"Doctor and Student\"  in 1518, they are:    1. If a man steals goods to the value of 12d., or above, it is  felony, and he shall die for it. If it is under the value of  12d., then it is but petit larceny, and he shall not die for it,  but shall be punished at the discretion of the judges. This not  apply to goods taken from the person, which is robbery, a felony  punishable by death.    2. If an exigent, in case of felony, is awarded against a man, he  has thereby forthwith forfeited his goods to the King.    3. If the son is attainted [convicted of treason or felony with  the death penalty and forfeiture of all lands and goods] in the  life of the father, and after he purchases his charter of pardon  of the King, and after the father dies; in this case the land  shall escheat to the lord of the fee, insomuch that though he  has a younger brother, yet the land shall not descend to him: for  by the attainder of the elder brother the blood is corrupt, and  the father-in-law died without heir.    4. A man declared outlaw forfeits his profits from land and his  goods to the King.    5. He who is arraigned upon an indictment of felony shall be  admitted, in favor of life, to challenge the number of inquirers  for three whole inquests peremptorily. With cause, he may  challenge as many as he has cause to challenge. Such peremptory  challenge shall not be admitted in a private suit because it is  a suit of the party.    6. An accessory shall not be put to answer before the principal.    7. If a man commands another to commit a trespass, and he does  it, the one who made the command is a trespasser.    8. The land of every man is in the law enclosed from other,  though it lies in the open field and a trespasser in it may be  brought to court.    9. Every man is bound to make recompense for such hurt as his  beasts do in the growing grain or grass of his neighbor, though  he didn't know that they were there.    10. He who has possession of land, though it is by disseisin, has  right against all men but against him who has right.    11. The rents, commons of pasture, of turbary [digging turf],  reversions, remainders, nor such other things which lie not in  manual occupation, may not be given or granted to another  without writing.    12. If a villein purchase lands, and the lord enter, he shall  enjoy the land as his own. But if the villein alienates before  the lord enters, he alienation is good. And the same law is of  goods.    13. Escuage [shield service for 40 days] uncertain makes knight's  service. Escuage certain makes socage.    14. He who holds by castle-guard, holds by knight's service, but  he does not hold by escuage. He that holds by 20s. to the guard  of a castle holds by socage.    15. A descent takes away an entry.    16. No prescription [assertion of a right or title to the  enjoyment of a thing, on the ground of having had the  uninterrupted and immemorial enjoyment of it] in lands makes a  right.    17. A prescription of rent and profits out of land makes a right.    18. The limitation of a prescription generally taken is from the  time that no man's mind runs to the contrary.    19. Assigns may be made upon lands given in fee, for term of  life, or for term of years, though no mention be made of  assigns; and the same law is of a rent that is granted; but  otherwise it is of a warranty, and of a covenant.    20. He who recovers debt or damages in the King's court when the  person charged is not in custody, may within a year after the  judgment take the body of the defendant, and commit him to  prison until he has paid the debt and damages.    21. If a release or confirmation is made to him who, at the time  of the release made, had nothing in the land, the release or  confirmation is void, except in certain cases, such as to vouch.    22. A condition to avoid a freehold cannot be pleaded without a  deed; but to avoid a gift of chattel, it may be pleaded without  deed.    23. A release or confirmation made by him, that at the time of  the release or confirmation made had no right, is void in law,  though a right comes to him after; except if it is with  warranty, and then it shall bar him to all right that he shall  have after the warranty is made.    24. If land and rent that is going out of the same land, comes  into one man's hand of like estate, and like surety of title,  the rent is extinct.    25. If land descends to him who has right to the same land  before, he shall be remitted to his better"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16940"],[0,"Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh (#16)"],[1,"words in consideration  of the weakness and frailty of men; otherwise, the Cause We have  proclaimed is such as no pen can ever describe, nor any mind conceive its  greatness. To this beareth witness He with Whom is the Mother Book.            XLV: THE ANCIENT BEAUTY HATH CONSENTED TO BE...      The Ancient Beauty hath consented to be bound with chains that mankind may  be released from its bondage, and hath accepted to be made a prisoner  within this most mighty Stronghold that the whole world may attain unto  true liberty. He hath drained to its dregs the cup of sorrow, that all the  peoples of the earth may attain unto abiding joy, and be filled with  gladness. This is of the mercy of your Lord, the Compassionate, the Most  Merciful. We have accepted to be abased, O believers in the Unity of God,  that ye may be exalted, and have suffered manifold afflictions, that ye  might prosper and flourish. He Who hath come to build anew the whole  world, behold, how they that have joined partners with God have forced Him  to dwell within the most desolate of cities!            XLVI: I SORROW NOT FOR THE BURDEN OF MY IMPRISONMENT....      I sorrow not for the burden of My imprisonment. Neither do I grieve over  My abasement, or the tribulation I suffer at the hands of Mine enemies. By  My life! They are My glory, a glory wherewith God hath adorned His own  Self. Would that ye know it!    The shame I was made to bear hath uncovered the glory with which the whole  of creation had been invested, and through the cruelties I have endured,  the Day Star of Justice hath manifested itself, and shed its splendor upon  men.    My sorrows are for those who have involved themselves in their corrupt  passions, and claim to be associated with the Faith of God, the Gracious,  the All-Praised.    It behoveth the people of Baha to die to the world and all that is  therein, to be so detached from all earthly things that the inmates of  Paradise may inhale from their garment the sweet smelling savor of  sanctity, that all the peoples of the earth may recognize in their faces  the brightness of the All-Merciful, and that through them may be spread  abroad the signs and tokens of God, the Almighty, the All-Wise. They that  have tarnished the fair name of the Cause of God, by following the things  of the flesh--these are in palpable error!            XLVII: O JEWS! IF YE BE INTENT ON CRUCIFYING ONCE...      O Jews! If ye be intent on crucifying once again Jesus, the Spirit of God,  put Me to death, for He hath once more, in My person, been made manifest  unto you. Deal with Me as ye wish, for I have vowed to lay down My life in  the path of God. I will fear no one, though the powers of earth and heaven  be leagued against Me. Followers of the Gospel! If ye cherish the desire  to slay Muhammad, the Apostle of God, seize Me and put an end to My life,  for I am He, and My Self is His Self. Do unto Me as ye like, for the  deepest longing of Mine heart is to attain the presence of My Best-Beloved  in His Kingdom of Glory. Such is the Divine decree, if ye know it.  Followers of Muhammad! If it be your wish to riddle with your shafts the  breast of Him Who hath caused His Book the Bayan to be sent down unto you,  lay hands on Me and persecute Me, for I am His Well-Beloved, the  revelation of His own Self, though My name be not His name. I have come in  the shadows of the clouds of glory, and am invested by God with invincible  sovereignty. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. I,  verily, anticipate from you the treatment ye have accorded unto Him that  came before Me. To this all things, verily, witness, if ye be of those who  hearken. O people of the Bayan! If ye have resolved to shed the blood of  Him Whose coming the Bab hath proclaimed, Whose advent Muhammad hath  prophesied, and Whose Revelation Jesus Christ Himself hath announced,  behold Me standing, ready and defenseless, before you. Deal with Me after  your own desires.            XLVIII: GOD IS MY WITNESS! HAD IT NOT BEEN IN...      God is my witness! Had it not been in conflict with that which the Tablets  of God have decreed, I would have gladly kissed the hands of whosoever  attempted to shed my blood in the path of the Well-Beloved. I would,  moreover, have bestowed upon him a share of such worldly goods as God had  allowed me to possess, even though he who perpetrated this act would have  provoked the wrath of the Almighty, incurred His malediction, and deserved  to be tormented throughout the eternity of God, the All-Possessing, the  Equitable, the All-Wise.            XLIX: KNOW VERILY THAT WHENEVER THIS YOUTH...      Know verily that whenever this Youth turneth His eyes towards His own  self, he findeth it the most insignificant of all creation. When He  contemplates, however, the bright effulgences He hath been empowered to  manifest, lo, that self is transfigured before Him into a sovereign  Potency permeating the essence of all things visible and invisible. Glory  be to Him Who, through the power of truth, hath sent down the  Manifestation of His own Self and entrusted Him with His message unto all  mankind.            L: SHAKE OFF, O HEEDLESS ONES, THE SLUMBER OF...      Shake off, O heedless ones, the slumber of negligence, that ye may behold  the radiance which His glory hath spread through the world. How foolish  are those who murmur against the premature birth of His light. O ye who  are inly blind! Whether too soon or too late, the evidences of His  effulgent glory are now actually manifest. It behoveth you to ascertain  whether or not such a light hath appeared. It is neither within your power  nor mine to set the time at which it should be made manifest. God's  inscrutable Wisdom hath fixed its hour beforehand. Be content, O people,  with that which God hath desired for you and predestined unto you.... O my  ill-wishers! The Day Star of eternal Guidance beareth me witness: Had it  been in my power, I would have, under no circumstances, consented to  distinguish myself amongst men, for the Name I bear utterly disdaineth to  associate itself with this generation whose tongues are sullied and whose  hearts are false. And whenever I chose to hold my peace and be still, lo,  the voice of the Holy Ghost, standing on my right hand, aroused me, and  the Supreme Spirit appeared before my face, and Gabriel overshadowed me,  and the Spirit of Glory stirred within my bosom, bidding me arise and  break my silence. If your hearing be purged and your ears be attentive, ye  will assuredly perceive that every limb of my body, nay all the atoms of  my being, proclaim and bear witness to this call: \"God, besides Whom is  none other God, and He, Whose beauty is now manifest, is the reflection of  His glory unto all that are in heaven and on earth.\"            LI: O PEOPLE! I SWEAR BY THE ONE TRUE GOD! THIS...      O people! I swear by the one true God! This is the Ocean out of which all  seas have proceeded, and with which every one of them will ultimately be  united. From Him all the Suns have been generated, and unto Him they will  all return. Through His potency the Trees of Divine Revelation have  yielded their fruits, every one of which hath been sent down in the form  of a Prophet, bearing a Message to God's creatures in each of the worlds  whose number God, alone, in His all-encompassing Knowledge, can reckon.  This He hath accomplished through the agency of but one Letter of His  Word, revealed by His Pen--a Pen moved by His directing Finger--His Finger  itself sustained by the power of God's Truth.            LII: SAY: O PEOPLE! WITHHOLD NOT FROM YOURSELVES...      Say: O people! Withhold not from yourselves the grace of God and His  mercy. Whoso withholdeth himself therefrom is indeed in grievous loss.  What, O people! Do ye worship the dust, and turn away from your Lord, the  Gracious, the All-Bountiful? Fear ye God, and be not of those who perish.  Say: The Book of God hath been sent down in the form of this Youth.  Hallowed, therefore, be God, the most excellent of makers! Take ye good  heed, O peoples of the world, lest ye flee from His face. Nay, make haste  to attain His presence, and be of them that have returned unto Him. Pray  to be forgiven, O people, for having failed in your duty towards God, and  for having trespassed against His Cause, and be not of the foolish. He it  is Who hath created you; He it is Who hath nourished your souls through  His Cause, and enabled you to recognize Him Who is the Almighty, the Most  Exalted, the All-Knowing. He it is Who hath unveiled to your eyes the  treasures of His knowledge, and caused you to ascend unto the heaven of  certitude--the certitude of His resistless, His irrefutable, and most  exalted Faith. Beware that ye do not deprive yourselves of the grace of  God, that ye do not bring to naught your works, and do not repudiate the  truth of this most manifest, this lofty, this shining, and glorious  Revelation. Judge ye fairly the Cause of God, your Creator, and behold  that which hath been sent down from the Throne on high, and meditate  thereon with innocent and sanctified hearts. Then will the truth of this  Cause appear unto you as manifest as the sun in its noon-tide glory. Then  will ye be of them that have believed in Him.    Say: The first and foremost testimony establishing His truth is His own  Self. Next to this testimony is His Revelation. For whoso faileth to  recognize either the one or the other He hath established the words He  hath revealed as proof of His reality and truth. This is, verily, an  evidence of His tender mercy unto men. He hath endowed every soul with the  capacity to recognize the signs of God. How could He, otherwise, have  fulfilled His testimony unto men, if ye be of them that ponder His Cause  in their hearts. He will never deal unjustly with any one, neither will He  task a soul beyond its power. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the  All-Merciful.    Say: So great"]]]
