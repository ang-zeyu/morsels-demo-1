His master, returning          home from a tourney, met him on the way, and asked him          where he was going. He replied, with great coolness,          that he was going to seek a lodging somewhere. \"A          lodging!\" said the count. \"What then has happened at          home?\" \"Nothing, my lord. Only your dog, whom you love          so much, is dead.\" \"How so?\" \"Your fine palfrey, while          being exercised in the court, became frightened, and in          running fell into the well.\" \"Ah, who startled the          horse?\" \"It was your son, Damaiseau, who fell at its          feet from the window.\" \"My son!--O Heaven! Where, then,          were his servant and his mother? Is he injured?\" \"Yes,          sire, he has been killed by falling. And when they went          to tell it to madame, she was so affected that she fell          dead also without speaking.\" \"Rascal! in place of flying          away, why hast thou not gone to seek assistance, or why          didst thou not remain at the chateau?\" \"There is no more          need, sire; for Marotte, in watching madame, fell          asleep. A light caused the fire, and there remains          nothing now.\"--Truly a delicate way of \"breaking ill          news\"!    The Samradian sect of fire-worshippers, who believe only in the \"ideal,\"  anticipated Bishop Berkeley's theory, thus referred to by Lord Byron  (_Don Juan_, xi, 1):      When Bishop Berkeley said, \"there was no matter,\"      And proved it--'twas no matter what he said;    They say, his system 'tis in vain to batter,      Too subtle for the airiest human head.    Some amusing anecdotes regarding this singular sect are given in the  Dabistan, a work written in Persian, which furnishes a very impartial  account of the principal religions of the world: A Samradian said to his  servant: \"The world and its inhabitants have no actual existence--they  have merely an ideal being.\" The servant, on hearing this, took the  first opportunity to steal his master's horse, and when he was about to  ride, brought him an ass with the horse's saddle. When the Samradian  asked: \"Where is the horse?\" he replied: \"Thou hast been thinking of an  idea; there was no horse in being.\" The master said: \"It is true,\" and  then mounted the ass. Having proceeded some distance, followed by his  servant on foot, he suddenly dismounted, and taking the saddle off the  back of the ass placed it on the servant's back, drawing the girths  tightly, and, having forced the bridle into his mouth, he mounted him,  and flogged him along vigorously. The servant having exclaimed in  piteous accents: \"What is the meaning of this, O master?\" the Samradian  replied: \"There is no such thing as a whip; it is merely ideal. Thou art  thinking only of a delusion.\" It is needless to add that the servant  immediately repented and restored the horse.--Another of this sect  having obtained in marriage the daughter of a wealthy lawyer, she, on  finding out her husband's peculiar creed, purposed to have some  amusement at his expense. One day the Samradian brought home a bottle of  excellent wine, which during his absence she emptied of its contents and  filled again with water. When the time came for taking wine, she poured  out the water into a gold cup, which Was her own property. The Samradian  remarked: \"Thou hast given me water instead of wine.\" \"It is only  ideal,\" she answered; \"there was no wine in existence.\" The husband then  said: \"Thou hast spoken well; give me the cup that I may go to a  neighbour's house and bring it back full of wine.\" He thereupon took the  gold cup and went out and sold it, concealing the money, and, instead of  the gold vase, he brought back an earthen vessel filled with wine. The  wife, on seeing this, said: \"What hast thou done with the golden cup?\"  He quietly replied: \"Thou art surely thinking of an ideal gold cup,\" on  which the lady sorely repented her witticism.[35]       [35] _The Dabistan, or School of Manners_. Translated from          the original Persian, by David Shea and Anthony Troyer.          3 vols. Published by the Oriental Translation Fund,          1843. Vol. i, 198-200. The author of this work is said          to be Moshan Fani, who flourished at Hyderabad about the          end of the 18th century.    I do not know whether there are any English parallels to these stories,  but I have read of a Greek sage who instructed his slave that all that  occurred in this world was the decree of Fate. The slave shortly after  deliberately committed some offence, upon which his master commenced to  soften his ribs with a stout cudgel, and when the slave pleaded that it  was no fault of his, it was the decree of Fate, his master grimly  replied that it was also decreed that he should have a sound beating.           *       *       *       *       *    In _Don Quixote_, it will be remembered by all readers of that  delightful work, Sancho begins to tell the knight a long story about a  man who had to ferry across a river a large flock of sheep, but he could  only take one at a time, as the boat could hold no more. This story  Cervantes, in all likelihood, borrowed from the _Disciplina Clericalis_  of Petrus Alfonsus, a converted Spanish Jew, who flourished in the 12th  century, and who avowedly derived the materials of his work from the  Arabian fabulists--probably part of them also from the Talmud.[36] His  eleventh tale is of a king who desired his minstrel to tell him a long  story that should lull him to sleep. The story-teller accordingly begins  to relate how a man had to cross a ferry with 600 sheep, two at a time,  and falls asleep in the midst of his narration. The king awakes him, but  the story-teller begs that the man be allowed to ferry over the sheep  before he resumes the story.[37]--Possibly the original form of the  story is that found in the _Katha Manjari_, an ancient Indian  story-book: There was a king who used to inquire of all the learned men  who came to his court whether they knew any stories, and when they had  related all they knew, in order to avoid rewarding them, he abused them  for knowing so few, and sent them away. A shrewd and clever man, hearing  of this, presented himself before the king, who asked his name. He  replied that his name was Ocean of Stories. The king then inquired how  many stories he knew, to which he answered that the name of Ocean had  been conferred on him because he knew an endless number. On being  desired to relate one, he thus began: \"O King, there was a tank 36,000  miles in breadth, and 54,000 in length. This was densely filled with  lotus plants, and millions upon millions of birds with golden wings  [called Hamsa] perched on those flowers. One day a hurricane arose,  accompanied with rain, which the birds were not able to endure, and they  entered a cave under a rock, which was in the vicinity of the tank.\" The  king asked what happened next, and he replied that one of the birds flew  away. The king again inquired what else occurred, and he answered:  \"Another flew away\"; and to every question of the king he continued to  give the same answer. At this the king felt ashamed, and, seeing it was  impossible to outwit the man, he dismissed him with a handsome present.       [36] Pedro Alfonso (the Spanish form of his adopted name) was          originally a Jewish Rabbi, and was born in 1062, at          Huesca, in the kingdom of Arragon. He was reputed a man          of very great learning, and on his being baptised (at          the age of 44) was appointed by Alfonso XV, king of          Castile and Leon, physician to the royal household. His          work, above referred to, is written in Latin, and has          been translated into French, but not as yet into          English. An outline of the tales, by Douce, will be          found prefixed to Ellis' _Early English Metrical          Romances_.       [37] This is also the subject of one of the _Fabliaux_.--In          a form similar to the story in Alfonsus it is current          among the Milanese, and a Sicilian version is as          follows: Once upon a time there was a prince who studied          and racked his brains so much that he learned magic and          the art of finding hidden treasures. One day he          discovered a treasure in Daisisa. \"O,\" he says, \"now I          am going to get it out.\" But to get it out it was          necessary that ten million million of ants should cross          the river one by one in a bark made of the half-shell of          a nut. The prince puts the bark in the river, and makes          the ants pass over--one, two, three; and they are still          doing it. Here the story-teller pauses and says: \"We          will finish the story when the ants have finished          crossing the river.\"--Crane's _Italian Popular Tales_,          p. 156.    A story bearing some resemblance to this is related of a khalif who was  wont to cheat poets of their expected reward when they recited their  compositions to him,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16955"],[0,"Three Translations of The Koran (Al-Qur'an) side (#16)"],[1,"task for that which your hearts  have garnered. Allah is Forgiving, Clement.    S: Allah does not call you to account for what is vain in your oaths,  but He will call you to account for what your hearts have earned, and  Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.    002.226  Y: For those who take an oath for abstention from their wives, a waiting  for four months is ordained; if then they return, Allah is  Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.    P: Those who forswear their wives must wait four months; then, if they  change their mind, lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.    S: Those who swear that they will not go in to their wives should wait  four months; so if they go back, then Allah is surely Forgiving,  Merciful.    002.227  Y: But if their intention is firm for divorce, Allah heareth and knoweth  all things.    P: And if they decide upon divorce (let them remember that) Allah is  Hearer, Knower.    S: And if they have resolved on a divorce, then Allah is surely Hearing,  Knowing.    002.228  Y: Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly  periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in  their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their  husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if  they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to  the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a  degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.    P: Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart, three  (monthly) courses. And it is not lawful for them that they should  conceal that which Allah hath created in their wombs if they are  believers in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands would do better  to take them back in that case if they desire a reconciliation. And  they (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them in  kindness, and men are a degree above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise.    S: And the divorced women should keep themselves in waiting for three  courses; and it is not lawful for them that they should conceal what  Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the last  day; and their husbands have a better right to take them back in the  meanwhile if they wish for reconciliation; and they have rights similar  to those against them in a just manner, and the men are a degree above  them, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.    002.229  Y: A divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should  either hold Together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness. It  is not lawful for you, (Men), to take back any of your gifts (from your  wives), except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep  the limits ordained by Allah. If ye (judges) do indeed fear that they  would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah, there is no blame  on either of them if she give something for her freedom. These are the  limits ordained by Allah; so do not transgress them if any do  transgress the limits ordained by Allah, such persons wrong (Themselves  as well as others).    P: Divorce must be pronounced twice and then (a woman) must be retained  in honour or released in kindness. And it is not lawful for you that ye  take from women aught of that which ye have given them; except (in the  case) when both fear that they may not be able to keep within the  limits (imposed by) Allah. And if ye fear that they may not be able to  keep the limits of Allah, in that case it is no sin for either of them  if the woman ransom herself. These are the limits (imposed by) Allah.  Transgress them not. For whoso transgresseth Allah's limits: such are  wrong-doers.    S: Divorce may be (pronounced) twice, then keep (them) in good  fellowship or let (them) go with kindness; and it is not lawful for you  to take any part of what you have given them, unless both fear that  they cannot keep within the limits of Allah; then if you fear that they  cannot keep within the limits of Allah, there is no blame on them for  what she gives up to become free thereby. These are the limits of  Allah, so do not exceed them and whoever exceeds the limits of Allah  these it is that are the unjust.    002.230  Y: So if a husband divorces his wife (irrevocably), He cannot, after  that, re-marry her until after she has married another husband and He  has divorced her. In that case there is no blame on either of them if  they re-unite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits  ordained by Allah. Such are the limits ordained by Allah, which He  makes plain to those who understand.    P: And if he hath divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful  unto him thereafter until she hath wedded another husband. Then if he  (the other husband) divorce her it is no sin for both of them that they  come together again if they consider that they are able to observe the  limits of Allah. These are the limits of Allah. He manifesteth them for  people who have knowledge.    S: So if he divorces her she shall not be lawful to him afterwards until  she marries another husband; then if he divorces her there is no blame  on them both if they return to each other (by marriage), if they think  that they can keep within the limits of Allah, and these are the limits  of Allah which He makes clear for a people who know.    002.231  Y: When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their ('Iddat),  either take them back on equitable terms or set them free on equitable  terms; but do not take them back to injure them, (or) to take undue  advantage; if any one does that; He wrongs his own soul. Do not treat  Allah's Signs as a jest, but solemnly rehearse Allah's favours on you,  and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and Wisdom, for your  instruction. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is well acquainted  with all things.    P: When ye have divorced women, and they have reached their term, then  retain them in kindness or release them in kindness. Retain them not to  their hurt so that ye transgress (the limits). He who doeth that hath  wronged his soul. Make not the revelations of Allah a laughing-stock  (by your behaviour), but remember Allah's grace upon you and that which  He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture and of wisdom, whereby He  doth exhort you. Observe your duty to Allah and know that Allah is  Aware of all things.    S: And when you divorce women and they reach their prescribed time, then  either retain them in good fellowship or set them free with liberality,  and do not retain them for injury, so that you exceed the limits, and  whoever does this, he indeed is unjust to his own soul; and do not take  Allah's communications for a mockery, and remember the favor of Allah  upon you, and that which He has revealed to you of the Book and the  Wisdom, admonishing you thereby; and be careful (of your duty to)  Allah, and know that Allah is the Knower of all things.    002.232  Y: When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their ('Iddat), do  not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they  mutually agree on equitable terms. This instruction is for all amongst  you, who believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is (the course Making  for) most virtue and purity amongst you and Allah knows, and ye know  not.    P: And when ye have divorced women and they reach their term, place not  difficulties in the way of their marrying their husbands if it is  agreed between them in kindness. This is an admonition for him among  you who believeth in Allah and the Last Day. That is more virtuous for  you, and cleaner. Allah knoweth; ye know not.    S: And when you have divorced women and they have ended-- their term (of  waiting), then do not prevent them from marrying their husbands when  they agree among themselves in a lawful manner; with this is admonished  he among you who believes in Allah and the last day, this is more  profitable and purer for you; and Allah knows while you do not know.    002.233  Y: The mothers shall give suck to their offspring for two whole years,  if the father desires to complete the term. But he shall bear the cost  of their food and clothing on equitable terms. No soul shall have a  burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No mother shall be Treated  unfairly on account of her child. Nor father on account of his child,  an heir shall be chargeable in the same way. If they both decide on  weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no  blame on them. If ye decide on a foster-mother for your offspring,  there is no blame on you, provided ye pay (the mother) what ye offered,  on equitable terms. But fear Allah and know that Allah sees well what  ye do.    P: Mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years; (that is)  for those who wish to complete the suckling. The duty of feeding and  clothing nursing mothers in a seemly manner is upon the father of the  child. No-one should be charged beyond his capacity. A mother should  not be made to suffer because of her child, nor should he to whom the  child is born (be made to suffer) because of his child. And on the  (father's) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on  the father). If they desire to wean the child by mutual consent and  (after) consultation, it is no sin for them; and if ye wish to give  your children out to nurse, it is no sin for you, provide that ye pay  what is due from you in kindness. Observe your duty to Allah, and know  that Allah is Seer of what ye do.    S: And the mothers should suckle their children for two whole years for  him who desires to make complete the time of suckling; and their  maintenance and their clothing must be-- borne by the father according  to usage; no soul shall have imposed upon it a duty but to the extent  of its capacity; neither shall a mother be made to suffer harm on  account of her child, nor a father on account of his child, and a  similar duty (devolves) on the (fathe"]]]
