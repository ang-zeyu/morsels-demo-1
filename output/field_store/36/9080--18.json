There is no doubt about the  earnestness with which these things are said.\" Russell's _Diary_ is  largely a condensation of his letters to the _Times_. In the letter of  April 30, 1861 (published May 28), he dilates to the extent of a column  on the yearning of South Carolina for a restoration of colonial  relations. But Consul Bunch on December 14, 1860, reported a Charleston  sentiment very different from that of the Jockey Club in February. He  wrote to Lyons:         \"The church bells are ringing like mad in celebration of a       newly revived festival, called 'Evacuation Day,' being the       _nefastus ille dies_ in which the bloody Britishers left       Charleston 78 years ago. It has fallen into utter disuse for       about 50 years, but is now suddenly resuscitated apropos _de_       nothing at all.\"    In this same letter Bunch described a Southern patriotic demonstration.  Returning to his home one evening, he met a military company, which from  curiosity he followed, and which         \"drew up in front of the residence of a young lawyer of my       friends, after performing in whose honour, through the medium       of a very brassy band, a Secession Schottische or Palmetto       Polka, it clamorously demanded his presence. After a very       brief interval he appeared, and altho' he is in private life       an agreeable and moderately sensible young man, he succeeded,       to my mind at any rate, in making most successfully, what Mr.       Anthony Weller calls 'an Egyptian Mummy of his self.' the       amount of balderdash and rubbish which he evacuated (_dia       stomatos_) about mounting the deadly breach, falling back       into the arms of his comrades and going off generally in a       blaze of melodramatic fireworks, really made me so unhappy       that I lost my night's rest. So soon as the speech was over       the company was invited into the house to 'pour a libation to       the holy cause'--in the vernacular, to take a drink and spit       on the floor.\"    Evidently Southern eloquence was not tolerable to the ears of the  British consul. Or was it the din of the church bells rather than the  clamour of the orator, that offended him?

The Russian Minister, Stoeckl, early declared the Union  permanently destroyed, and regretting the fact, yet hoped the North  would soon accept the inevitable and seek close co-operation with the  South in commerce and in foreign relations. This view was repeated by  him many times and most emphatically as late as the first month of 1863.  (Russian Archives, Stoeckl to F.O., January 29-February 10, 1863. No.  342.) It was not until September, 1863, that Stoeckl ventured to hope  for a Northern reconquest of the South. I am indebted to Dr. Frank A.

From 1850 on  he was an acceptable public speaker in all matters liberal, as free  trade, social reform, and anti-slavery. Elected to Parliament in 1859  and again in 1861 from Bradford, where he was engaged in business as a  woollen manufacturer, he sought, after the fashion of new Members, a  cause to represent and found it in championship of the North. Having  great native ability, as shown by his later distinguished career, it was  the good fortune of the United States thus to enlist so eager a  champion. Forster and John Bright were the two leading \"friends of the  North\" in Parliament. The latter already had established reputation, but  was more influential out of Parliament than in it. Forster, with a  reputation to make, showed skill in debate, and soon achieved prestige  for himself and his American cause. Henry Adams, son and private  secretary of the American Minister to England, once told the writer that  he regarded Forster's services as, on the whole, the most valuable  rendered by any Englishman to the North.]    [Footnote 84: F.O., Am., Vol. 780, No. 30.]    [Footnote 85: Newton, _Lord Lyons_, Vol. I, p. 30.]    [Footnote 86: F.O., Am., Vol. 760, No. 40.]    [Footnote 87: Russell Papers.

Marguerite! I will see  neither doctor nor lawyer; and if any meddling priest dare--\"    \"It is only an old friend, sir;\" interrupted Marguerite, opening the  inner door.    Her master, on looking up, perceived the red face of Monsieur Ramin  peeping over the old woman's shoulder, and irefully cried out:    \"How dare you bring that fellow here? And you, sir, how dare you  come?\"    \"My good old friend, there are feelings,\" said Ramin, spreading his  fingers over the left pocket of his waistcoat--\"there are feelings,\"  he repeated, \"that cannot be subdued. One such feeling brought me  here. The fact is, I am a good-natured easy fellow, and I never  bear malice. I never forget an old friend, but love to forget old  differences when I find one party in affliction.\"    He drew a chair forward as he spoke, and composedly seated himself  opposite to his late master.    Monsieur Bonelle was a thin old man, with a pale sharp face and keen  features. At first he eyed his visitor from the depths of his vast  arm-chair; but, as if not, satisfied with this distant view, he bent  forward, and laying both hands on his thin knees, he looked up into  Ramin's face with a fixed and piercing gaze. He had not, however, the  power of disconcerting his guest.    \"What did you come here for?\" he at length asked.    \"Merely to have the extreme satisfaction of seeing how you are, my  good old friend. Nothing more.\"    \"Well, look at me--and then go.\"    Nothing could be so discouraging: but this was an Excellent  Opportunity, and when Monsieur Ramin _had_ an excellent opportunity in  view, his pertinacity was invincible. Being now resolved to stay, it  was not in Monsieur Bonelle's power to banish him. At the same time  he had tact enough to render his presence agreeable. He knew that his  coarse and boisterous wit had often delighted Monsieur Bonelle of old,  and he now exerted himself so successfully as to betray the old man  two or three times into hearty laughter. \"Ramin,\" said he at length,  laying his thin hand on the arm of his guest, and peering with his  keen glance into the mercer's purple face, \"you are a funny fellow,  but I know you; you cannot make me believe you have called just to  see how I am, and to amuse me. Come, be candid for once; what do you  want?\"    Ramin threw himself back in his chair, and laughed blandly, as much as  to say, \"Can you suspect me?\"    \"I have no shop now out of which you can wheedle me,\" continued the  old man; \"and surely you are not such a fool as to come to me for  money.\"    \"Money!\" repeated the draper, as if his host had mentioned something  he never dreamt of. \"Oh, no!\"    Ramin saw it would not do to broach the subject he had really come  about, too abruptly, now that suspicion seemed so wide awake--_the_  opportunity had not arrived.    \"There is something up, Ramin, I know; I see it in the twinkle of your  eye; but you can't deceive me again.\"    \"Deceive _you_?\" said the jolly schemer, shaking his head  reverentially. \"Deceive a man of your penetration and depth?  Impossible! The bare supposition is flattery. My dear friend,\" he  continued, soothingly, \"I did not dream of such a thing. The fact is,  Bonelle, though they call me a jovial, careless, rattling dog, I have  a conscience; and, somehow, I have never felt quite easy about the  way in which I became your successor down-stairs. It was rather sharp  practice, I admit.\"    Bonelle seemed to relent.    \"Now for it,\" said the Opportunity-hunter to himself--\"By-the-bye,\"  (speaking aloud,) \"this house must be a great trouble to you in your  present weak state? Two of your lodgers have lately gone away without  paying--a great nuisance, especially to an invalid.\"    \"I tell you I'm as sound as a colt.\"    \"At all events, the whole concern must be a great bother to you. If I  were you, I would sell the house.\"    \"And if I were _you_,\" returned the landlord, dryly, \"I would buy  it--\"    \"Precisely,\" interrupted the tenant, eagerly.    \"That is, if you could get it. Pooh! I knew you were after something.  Will you give eighty thousand francs for it?\" abruptly asked Monsieur  Bonelle.    \"Eighty thousand francs!\" echoed Ramin. \"Do you take me for Louis  Philippe or the Bank of France!\"    \"Then we'll say no more about it--are you not afraid of leaving your  shop so long?\"    Ramin returned to the charge, heedless of the hint to depart. \"The  fact is, my good old friend, ready money is not my strong point just  now. But if you wish very much to be relieved of the concern, what say  you to a life annuity? I could manage that.\"    Monsieur Bonelle gave a short, dry, church-yard cough, and looked as  if his life were not worth an hour's purchase. \"You think yourself  immensely clever, I dare say,\" he said. \"They have persuaded you that  I am dying. Stuff! I shall bury you yet.\"    The mercer glanced at the thin fragile frame, and exclaimed to  himself, \"Deluded old gentleman!\" \"My dear Bonelle,\" he continued,  aloud, \"I know well the strength of your admirable constitution: but  allow me to observe that you neglect yourself too much. Now, suppose  a good sensible doctor--\"    \"Will you pay him?\" interrogated Bonelle, sharply.    \"Most willingly,\" replied Ramin, with an eagerness that made the old  man smile. \"As to the annuity, since the subject annoys you, we will  talk of it some other time.\"    \"After you have heard the doctor's report,\" sneered Bonelle.    The mercer gave him a stealthy glance, which the old man's keen look  immediately detected. Neither could repress a smile: these good souls  understood one another perfectly, and Ramin saw that this was not the  Excellent Opportunity he desired, and departed.    The next day Ramin sent a neighboring medical man, and heard it was  his opinion that if Bonelle held on for three months longer, it would  be a miracle. Delightful news!    Several days elapsed, and although very anxious, Ramin assumed a  careless air, and did not call upon his landlord, or take any notice  of him. At the end of the week old Marguerite entered the shop to make  a trifling purchase.    \"And how are we getting on up-stairs?\" negligently asked Monsieur  Ramin.    \"Worse and worse, my good sir,\" she sighed. \"We have rheumatic pains  which often make us use expressions the reverse of Christian-like, and  yet nothing can induce us to see either the lawyer or the priest; the  gout is getting nearer to our stomach every day, and still we go on  talking about the strength of our constitution. Oh, sir, if you have  any influence with us, do, pray do, tell us how wicked it is to die  without making one's will or confessing one's sins.\"    \"I shall go up this very evening,\" ambiguously replied Monsieur Ramin.    He kept his promise, and found Monsieur Bonelle in bed, groaning with  pain, and in the worst of tempers.    \"What poisoning doctor did you send?\" he asked, with an ireful glance;  \"I want no doctor, I am not ill; I will not follow his prescription;  he forbade me to eat; I _will_ eat.\"    \"He is a very clever man,\" said the visitor. \"He told me that never  in the whole course of his experience has he met with what he called  so much 'resisting power' as exists in your frame. He asked me if you  were not of a long-lived race.\"    \"That is as people may judge,\" replied Monsieur Bonelle. \"All I  can say is, that my grandfather died at ninety, and my father at  eighty-six.\"    \"The doctor owned that you had a wonderfully strong constitution.\"    \"Who said I hadn't?\" exclaimed the invalid feebly.    \"You may rely on it, you would preserve your health better if you had  not the trouble of these vexatious lodgers. Have you thought about the  life annuity?\" said Ramin as carelessly as he could, considering how  near the matter was to his hopes and wishes.    \"Why, I have scruples,\" returned Bonelle, coughing. \"I do not wish to  take you in. My longevity would be the ruin of you.\"    \"To meet that difficulty,\" quickly replied the mercer, \"we can reduce  the interest.\"    \"But I must have high interest,\" placidly returned Monsieur Bonelle.    Ramin, on hearing this, burst into a loud fit of laughter, called  Monsieur Bonelle a sly old fox, gave him a poke in the ribs, which  made the old man cough for five minutes, and then proposed that they  should talk it over some other day. The mercer left Monsieur Bonelle  in the act of protesting that he felt as strong as a man of forty.    Monsieur Ramin felt in no hurry to conclude the proposed agreement.  \"The later one begins to pay, the better,\" he said, as he descended  the stairs.    Days passed on, and the negotiation made no way. It struck the  observant tradesman that all was not right. Old Marguerite several  times refused to admit him, declaring her master was asleep: there  was something mysterious and forbidding in her manner that seemed to  Monsieur Ramin very ominous. At length a sudden thought occurred to  him: the housekeeper--wishing to become her master's heir--had heard  his scheme and opposed it. On the very day that he arrived at this  conclusion, he met a lawyer, with whom he had formerly had some  transactions, coming down the staircase. The sight sent a chill  through the mercer's commercial heart, and a presentiment--one of  those presentiments that seldom deceive--told him it was too late. He  had, however, the fortitude to abstain from visiting Monsieur Bonelle  until evening came; when he went up, resolved to see him in spite  of all Marguerite might urge. The door was half-open, and the old  housekeeper stood talking on the landing to a middle-aged man in a  dark cassock.    \"It is all over! The old witch has got the priests at him,\" thought  Ramin, inwardly groaning at his own folly in allowing himself to be  forestalled.    \"You cannot see"]]]
