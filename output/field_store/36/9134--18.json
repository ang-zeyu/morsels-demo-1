As God intended to rest on the seventh day, the  Sabbath, the sixth day had to do double duty. It brought forth  six creations: Adam, Eve, cattle, reptiles, the beasts of the  field, and demons. The demons were made shortly before the  Sabbath came in, and they are, therefore, incorporeal  spirits--the Lord had no time to create bodies for them.[98]    In the twilight, between the sixth day and the Sabbath, ten  creations were, brought forth: the rainbow, invisible until  Noah's time; the manna; watersprings, whence Israel drew water  for his thirst in the desert; the writing upon the two tables of  stone given at Sinai; the pen with which the writing was written;  the two tables themselves; the mouth of Balaam's she-ass; the  grave of Moses; the cave in which Moses and Elijah dwelt; and the  rod of Aaron, with its blossoms and its ripe almonds.[99]      SABBATH IN HEAVEN    Before the world was created, there was none to praise God and  know Him. Therefore He created the angels and the holy Hayyot,  the heavens and their host, and Adam as well. They all were to  praise and glorify their Creator. During the week of creation,  however, there was no suitable time to proclaim the splendor and  praise of the Lord. Only on the Sabbath, when all creation  rested, the beings on earth and in heaven, all together, broke  into song and adoration when God ascended His throne and sate  upon it.[100] It was the Throne of Joy upon which He sate, and He  had all the angels pass before Him--the angel of the water, the  angel of the rivers, the angel of the mountains, the angel of the  hills, the angel of the abysses, the angel of the deserts, the  angel of the sun, the angel of the moon, the angel of the  Pleiades, the angel of Orion, the angel of the herbs, the angel  of Paradise, the angel of Gehenna, the angel of the trees, the  angel of the reptiles, the angel of the wild beasts, the angel of  the domestic animals, the angel of the fishes, the angel of the  locusts, the angel of the birds, the chief angel of the angels,  the angel of each heaven, the chief angel of each division of the  heavenly hosts, the chief angel of the holy Hayyot, the chief  angel of the cherubim, the chief angel of the ofanim, and all the  other splendid, terrible, and mighty angel chiefs. They all  appeared before God with great joy, laved in a stream of joy, and  they rejoiced and danced and sang, and extolled the Lord with  many praises and many instruments. The ministering angels began,  \"Let the glory of the Lord endure forever!\" And the rest of the  angels took up the song with the words, \"Let the Lord rejoice in  His works!\" 'Arabot, the seventh heaven, was filled with joy and  glory, splendor and strength, power and might and pride and  magnificence and grandeur, praise and jubilation, song and  gladness, steadfastness and righteousness, honor and adoration.    Then God bade the Angel of the Sabbath seat himself upon a throne  of glory, and He brought before him the chiefs of the angels of  all the heavens and all the abysses, and bade them dance and  rejoice, saying, \"Sabbath it is unto the Lord!\" and the exalted  princes of the heavens responded, \"Unto the Lord it is Sabbath!\"  Even Adam was permitted to ascend to the highest heaven, to take  part in the rejoicing over the Sabbath.    By bestowing Sabbath joy upon all beings, not excepting Adam,  thus did the Lord dedicate His creation. Seeing the majesty of  the Sabbath, its honor and greatness, and the joy it conferred  upon all, being the fount of all joy, Adam intoned a song of  praise for the Sabbath day. Then God said to him, \"Thou singest a  song of praise to the Sabbath day, and singest none to Me, the  God of the Sabbath?\" Thereupon the Sabbath rose from his seat,  and prostrated himself before God, saying, \"It is a good thing to  give thanks unto the Lord,\" and the whole of creation added, \"And  to sing praises unto Thy Name, O Most High!\"[101]    This was the first Sabbath, and this its celebration in heaven by  God and the angels. The angels were informed at the same time  that in days to come Israel would hallow the day in similar  manner. God told them: \"I will set aside for Myself a people from  among all the peoples. This people will observe the Sabbath, and  I will sanctify it to be My people, and I will be God unto it.  From all that I have seen, I have chosen the seed of Israel  wholly, and I have inscribed him as My first-born son, and I  sanctified him unto Myself unto all eternity, him and the  Sabbath, that he keep the Sabbath and hallow it from all  work.\"[102]    For Adam the Sabbath had a peculiar significance. When he was  made to depart out of Paradise in the twilight of the Sabbath  eve, the angels called after him, \"Adam did not abide in his  glory overnight!\" Then the Sabbath appeared before God as Adam's  defender, and he spoke: \"O Lord of the world! During the six  working days no creature was slain. If Thou wilt begin now by  slaying Adam, what will become of the sanctity and the blessing  of the Sabbath?\" In this way Adam was rescued from the fires of  hell, the meet punishment for his sins, and in gratitude he  composed a psalm in honor of the Sabbath, which David later  embodied in his Psalter.[103]    Still another opportunity was given to Adam to learn and  appreciate the value of the Sabbath. The celestial light, whereby  Adam could survey the world from end to end, should properly have  been made to disappear immediately after his sin. But out of  consideration for the Sabbath, God had let this light continue to  shine, and the angels, at sundown on the sixth day, intoned a  song of praise and thanksgiving to God, for the radiant light  shining through the night. Only with the going out of the Sabbath  day the celestial light ceased, to the consternation of Adam, who  feared that the serpent would attack him in the dark. But God  illumined his understanding, and he learned to rub two stones  against each other and produce light for his needs.[104]    The celestial light was but one of the seven precious gifts  enjoyed by Adam before the fall and to be granted to man again  only in the Messianic time. The others are the resplendence of  his countenance; life eternal; his tall stature; the fruits of  the soil; the fruits of the tree; and the luminaries of the sky,  the sun and the moon, for in the world to come the light of the  moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun  shall be sevenfold.[105]      ADAM'S REPENTANCE    Cast out of Paradise, Adam and Eve built a hut for themselves,  and for seven days they sat in it in great distress, mourning and  lamenting. At the end of the seven days, tormented by hunger,  they came forth and sought food. For seven other days, Adam  journeyed up and down in the land, looking for such dainties as  he had enjoyed in Paradise. In vain; he found nothing. Then Eve  spoke to her husband: \"My lord, if it please thee, slay me.  Mayhap God will then take thee back into Paradise, for the Lord  God became wroth with thee only on account of me.\" But Adam  rejected her plan with abhorrence, and both went forth again on  the search for food. Nine days passed, and still they found  naught resembling what they had had in Paradise. They saw only  food fit for cattle and beasts. Then Adam proposed: \"Let us do  penance, mayhap the Lord God will forgive us and have pity on us,  and give us something to sustain our life.\" Knowing that Eve was  not vigorous enough to undergo the mortification of the flesh  which he purposed to inflict upon himself, he prescribed a  penance for her different from his own. He said to her: \"Arise,  and go to the Tigris, take a stone and stand upon it in the  deepest part of the river, where the water will reach as high as  thy neck. And let no speech issue forth from thy mouth, for we  are unworthy to supplicate God, our lips are unclean by reason of  the forbidden fruit of the tree. Remain in the water for  thirty-seven days.\"    For himself Adam ordained forty days of fasting, while he stood  in the river Jordan in the same way as Eve was to take up her  stand in the waters of the Tigris. After he had adjusted the  stone in the middle of the Jordan, and mounted it, with the  waters surging up to his neck, he said: \"I adjure thee, O thou  water of the Jordan! Afflict thyself with me, and gather unto me  all swimming creatures that live in thee. Let them surround me  and sorrow with me, and let them not beat their own breasts with  grief, but let them beat me. Not they have sinned, only I alone!\"  Very soon they all came, the dwellers in the Jordan, and they  encompassed him, and from that moment the water of the Jordan  stood still and ceased from flowing.    The penance which Adam and Eve laid upon themselves awakened  misgivings in Satan. He feared God might forgive their sin, and  therefore essayed to hinder Eve in her purpose. After a lapse of  eighteen days he appeared unto her in the guise of an angel. As  though in distress on account of her, he began to cry, saying:  \"Step up out of the river, and weep no longer. The Lord God hath  heard your mourning, and your penitence hath been accepted by  Him. All the angels supplicated the Lord in your behalf, and He  hath sent me to fetch you out of the water and give you the  sustenance that you enjoyed in Paradise, and for which you have  been mourning.\" Enfeebled as she was by her penances and  mortifications, Eve yielded to the solicitations of Satan, and he  led her to where her husband was. Adam recognized him at once,  and amid tears he cried out: \"O Eve, Eve, where now is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 2 (#16)"],[1,"an answer to such balderdash.[224] \"My first-born son,\"  he said to himself, \"is a fool. What will it profit me, if I  slay his two sons? Does he not know that his sons are  equally mine?\"[225] Judah advised his brethren to desist from  urging their father then; he would consent, he thought, to  whatever expedients were found necessary, as soon as their  bread gave out, and a second journey to Egypt became  imperative.[226]    THE SECOND JOURNEY TO EGYPT    When the supplies bought in Egypt were eaten up, and  the family of Jacob began to suffer with hunger, the little  children came to him, and they said, \"Give us bread, that  we die not of hunger before thee.\" The words of the little  ones brought scorching tears to the eyes of Jacob, and he  summoned his sons and bade them go again down into Egypt  and buy food.[227] But Judah spake unto him, \"The man did  solemnly protest unto us, saying that we should not see his  face, except our brother Benjamin be with us, and we cannot  appear before him with idle pretexts.\" And Jacob said,  \"Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man  whether ye had yet a brother?\" It was the first and only  time Jacob indulged in empty talk, and God said, \"I made it  My business to raise his son to the position of ruler of  Egypt, and he complains, and says, Wherefore dealt ye so  ill with-me?\" And Judah protested against the reproach,  that he had initiated the Egyptian viceroy in their family  relations, with the words: \"Why, he knew the very wood  of which our baby coaches are made![228] Father,\" he continued,  \"if Benjamin goes with us, he may, indeed, be taken  from us, but also he may not. This is a doubtful matter,  but it is certain that if he does not go with us, we shall all  die of hunger. It is better not to concern thyself about what  is doubtful, and guide thy actions by what is certain.[229] The  king of Egypt is a strong and mighty king, and if we go to  him without our brother, we shall all be put to death. Dost  thou not know, and hast thou not heard, that this king is  very powerful and wise, and there is none like unto him in all  the earth? We have seen all the kings of the earth, but none  like unto the king of Egypt. One would surely say that  among all the kings of the earth there is none greater than  Abimelech king of the Philistines, yet the king of Egypt is  greater and mightier than he, and Abimelech can hardly be  compared with one of his officers. Father, thou hast not  seen his palace and his throne, and all his servants standing  before him. Thou hast not seen that king upon his throne,  in all his magnificence and with his royal insignia, arrayed  in his royal robes, with a large golden crown upon his head.  Thou hast not seen the honor and the glory that God hath  given unto him, for there is none like unto him in all the  earth. Father, thou hast not seen the wisdom, the understanding,  and the knowledge that God has given in his  heart. We heard his sweet voice when he spake unto us.  We know not, father, who acquainted him with our names,  and all that befell us. He asked also concerning thee, saying,  Is your father still alive, and is it well with him? Thou  hast not seen the affairs of the government of Egypt regulated  by him, for none asketh his lord Pharaoh about them.  Thou hast not seen the awe and the fear that he imposes  upon all the Egyptians. Even we went out from his presence  threatening to do unto Egypt as unto the cities of the  Amorites, and exceedingly wroth by reason of all his words  that he spake concerning us as spies, yet when we came  again before him, his terror fell upon us all, and none of us  was able to speak a word to him, great or small. Now,  therefore, father, send the lad with us, and we will arise and  go down into Egypt, and buy food to eat, that we die not of  hunger.\"[230]    Judah offered his portion in the world to come as surety  for Benjamin, and thus solemnly he promised to bring him  back safe and sound, and Jacob granted his request, and  permitted Benjamin to go down into Egypt with his other  sons. They also carried with them choice presents from  their father for the ruler of Egypt, things that arouse wonder  outside of Palestine, such as the murex, which is the  snail that produces the Tyrian purple, and various kinds of  balm, and almond oil, and pistachio oil, and honey as hard as  stone. Furthermore, Jacob put double money in their hand  to provide against a rise in prices in the meantime. And  after all these matters were attended to, he spake to his sons,  saying: \"Here is money, and here is a present, and also your  brother. Is there aught else that you need?\" And they  replied, Yes, we need this, besides, that thou shouldst  intercede for us with God.\" Then their father prayed:[231]  \"O Lord, Thou who at the time of creation didst call  Enough! to heaven and earth when they stretched themselves  out further and further toward infinity, set a limit  to my sufferings, too, say unto them, Enough![232] God Almighty  give you mercy before the ruler of Egypt, that he  may release unto you Joseph, Simon, and Benjamin.\"    This prayer was an intercession, not only for the sons of  Jacob, but also for their descendants--that God would deliver  the Ten Tribes in time to come, as He delivered the two,  Judah and Benjamin, and after He permitted the destruction  of two Temples, He would grant endless continuance to the  third.[233]    Jacob also put a letter addressed to the viceroy of Egypt  into the hands of his son. The letter ran thus: \"From thy  servant Jacob, the son of Isaac, the grandson of Abraham,  prince of God, to the mighty and wise king Zaphenathpaneah,  the ruler of Egypt, peace! I make known unto my  lord the king that the famine is sore with us in the land of  Canaan, and I have therefore sent my sons unto thee, to buy  us a little food, that we may live, and not die. My children  surrounded me, and begged for something to eat, but, alas,  I am very old, and I cannot see with mine eyes, for they are  heavy with the weight of years, and also on account of my  never-ceasing tears for my son Joseph, who hath been taken  from me. I charged my sons not to pass through the gate  all together at the same time, when they arrived in the city of  Egypt, in consideration of the inhabitants of the land, that  they might not take undue notice of them. Also I bade them  go up and down in the land of Egypt and seek my son Joseph,  mayhap they would find him there.    \"This did they do, but thou didst therefore account them  as spies. We have heard the report of thy wisdom and  sagacity. How, then, canst thou look upon their countenances,  and yet declare them to be spies? Especially as we  have heard thou didst interpret Pharaoh's dream, and didst  foretell the coming of the famine, are we amazed that thou,  in thy discernment, couldst not distinguish whether they be  spies or not.    \"And, now, O my lord king, I send unto thee my son Benjamin,  as thou didst demand of my other sons. I pray thee,  take good care of him until thou sendest him back to me in  peace with his brethren. Hast thou not heard, and dost thou  not know, what our God did unto Pharaoh when he took our  mother Sarah unto himself? Or what happened unto Abimelech  on account of her? And what our father Abraham  did unto the nine kings of Elam, how he killed them and  exterminated their armies, though he had but few men with  him? Or hast thou not heard what my two sons Simon and  Levi did to the eight cities of the Amorites, which they  destroyed  on account of their sister Dinah? Benjamin consoled  them for the loss of Joseph. What, then, will they do  unto him that stretcheth forth the hand of power to snatch  him away from them?    \"Knowest thou not, O king of Egypt, that the might of  our God is with us, and that He always hearkens unto our  prayers, and never forsakes us? Had I called upon God to  rise up against thee when my sons told me how thou didst act  toward them, thou and thy people, ye all would have been  annihilated ere Benjamin could come down to thee. But I  reflected that Simon my son was abiding in thy house, and  perhaps thou wast doing kindnesses unto him, and therefore  I invoked not the punishment of God upon thee. Now my  son Benjamin goeth down unto thee with my other sons.  Take heed unto thyself, keep thy eyes directed upon him,  and God will direct His eye upon all thy kingdom.    \"I have said all now that is in my heart. My sons take  their youngest brother down into Egypt with them, and do  thou send them all back to me in peace.\"    This letter Jacob put into the keeping of Judah, charging  him to deliver it to the ruler of Egypt. His last words to  his sons were an admonition to take good care of Benjamin  and not leave him out of their sight, either on the journey  or after their arrival in Egypt. He bade farewell to them,  and then turned in prayer to God, saying: \"O Lord of  heaven and earth! Remember Thy covenant with our  father Abraham. Remember also my father Isaac, and grant  grace unto my sons, and deliver them not into the hands of  the king of Egypt. O my God, do it for the sake of Thy  mercy, redeem my sons and save them from the hands of  the Egyptians, and restore their two brethren unto them.\"    Also the women and the children in the house of Jacob  prayed to God amid tears, and entreated Him to redeem their  husbands and their fathers out of the hands of the king of  Egypt.[234]      JOSEPH AND BENJAMIN    Great was the joy of Joseph when his brethren stood before  him and Benjamin was with them. In his youngest  brother he saw the true counterpart of his father.[235] He  ordered his son Manasseh,[236] the steward of his house, to  bring the men into the palace, and make ready a meal for  them. But he was to take care to prepare the meat dishes  in the presence of the guests, so that they might see with  their own eyes that the cattle had been slaughtered according"]]]
