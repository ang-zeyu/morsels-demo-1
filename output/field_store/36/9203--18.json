He accordingly, as his first step, convened a great assembly of the  leading chieftains and noblemen of the realm, and made addresses to  them, in which he urged upon them the imminence of the danger which  threatened their common country, and pressed them to unite vigorously  and energetically with him to contend against their common foe. They  must make great sacrifices, he said, both of their comfort and ease,  as well as of their wealth, to resist successfully so imminent a  danger. He summoned them to arms, and urged them to contribute the  means necessary to pay the expense of a vigorous prosecution of the  war. These harangues, and the ardor and determination which Alfred  manifested himself at the time of making them, were successful. The  nation aroused itself to new exertions, and for a time there was a  prospect that the country would be saved.    [Illustration: THE FIRST BRITISH FLEET.]    Among the other measures to which Alfred resorted in this emergency  was the attempt to encounter the Danes upon their own element by  building and equipping a fleet of ships, with which to proceed to  sea, in order to meet and attack upon the water certain new bodies  of invaders, who were on the way to join the Danes already on the  island--coming, as rumor said, along the southern shore. In attempting  to build up a naval power, the greatest difficulty, always, is to  provide seamen. It is much easier to build ships than to train  sailors. To man his little fleet, Alfred had to enlist such  half-savage foreigners as could be found in the ports, and even  pirates, as was said, whom he induced to enter his service, promising  them pay, and such plunder as they could take from the enemy. These  attempts of Alfred to build and man a fleet are considered the first  rude beginnings from which the present vast edifice of British naval  power took its origin. When the fleet was ready to put to sea, the  people thronged the shores, watching its movements with the utmost  curiosity and interest, earnestly hoping that it might be successful  in its contests with the more tried and experienced armaments with  which it would have to contend.    Alfred was, in fact, successful in the first enterprises which he  undertook with his ships. He encountered a fleet of the Danish ships  in the Channel, and defeated them. His fleet captured, moreover, one  of the largest of the vessels of the enemy; and, with what would be  thought in our day unpardonable cruelty, they threw the sailors and  soldiers whom they found on board into the sea, and kept the vessel.    After all, however, Alfred gained no conclusive and decisive victory  over his foes. They were too numerous, too scattered, and too firmly  seated in the various districts of the island, of some of which they  had been in possession for many years. Time passed on, battles were  fought, treaties of peace were made, oaths were taken, hostages  were exchanged, and then, after a very brief interval of repose,  hostilities would break out again, each party bitterly accusing the  other of treachery. Then the poor hostages would be slain, first by  one party, and afterward, in retaliation, by the other.    In one of these temporary and illusive pacifications, Alfred attempted  to bind the Danes by Christian oaths. Their customary mode of binding  themselves, in cases where they wished to impose a solemn religious  obligation, was to swear by a certain ornament which they wore upon  their arms, which is called in the chronicles of those times a  _bracelet_. What its form and fashion was we can not now precisely  know; but it is plain that they attached some superstitious, and  perhaps idolatrous associations of sacredness to it. To swear by this  bracelet was to place themselves under the most solemn obligation that  they could assume. Alfred, however, not satisfied with this pagan  sanction, made them, in confirming one treaty, swear by the Christian  relics, which were certain supposed memorials of our Saviour's  crucifixion, or portions of the bodies of dead saints miraculously  preserved, and to which the credulous Christians of that day attached  an idea of sacredness and awe, scarcely less superstitious than that  which their pagan enemies felt for the bracelets on their arms. Alfred  could not have supposed that these treacherous covenanters, since they  would readily violate the faith plighted in the name of what they  revered, could be held by what they hated and despised. Perhaps he  thought that, though they would be no more likely to keep the new oath  than the old, still, that their violation of it, when it occurred,  would be in itself a great crime--that his cause would be subsequently  strengthened by their thus incurring the special and unmitigated  displeasure of Heaven.    Among the Danish chieftains with whom Alfred had thus continually to  contend in this early part of his reign, there was one very famous  hero, whose name was Rollo. He invaded England with a wild horde which  attended him for a short time, but he soon retired and went to France,  where he afterward greatly distinguished himself by his prowess and  his exploits. The Saxon historians say that he retreated from England  because Alfred gave him such a reception that he saw that it would be  impossible for him to maintain his footing there. His account of it  was, that, one day, when he was perplexed with doubt and uncertainty  about his plans, he fell asleep and dreamed that he saw a swarm of  bees flying southward. This was an omen, as he regarded it, indicating  the course which he ought to pursue. He accordingly embarked his  men on board his ships again, and crossed the Channel, and sought  successfully in Normandy, a province of France the kingdom and the  home which, either on account of Alfred or of the bees, he was not to  enjoy in England.    The cases, however, in which the Danish chieftains were either  entirely conquered or finally expelled from the kingdom were very  few. As years passed on, Alfred found his army diminishing, and the  strength of his kingdom wasting away. His resources were exhausted,  his friends had disappeared, his towns and castles were taken, and, at  last, about eight years after his coronation at Winchester as monarch  of the most powerful of the Saxon kingdoms, he found himself reduced  to the very last extreme of destitution and distress.    [Footnote 1: For an account of Henrietta's adventures and sufferings  at Exeter, see the History of Charles II., chap. iii]          CHAPTER VIII.    THE SECLUSION.      Notwithstanding the tide of disaster and calamity which seemed to  be gradually overwhelming Alfred's kingdom, he was not reduced to  absolute despair, but continued for a long time the almost hopeless  struggle. There is a certain desperation to which men are often  aroused in the last extremity, which surpasses courage, and is even  sometimes a very effectual substitute for strength; and Alfred might,  perhaps, have succeeded, after all, in saving his affairs from utter  ruin, had not a new circumstance intervened, which seemed at once to  extinguish all remaining hope and to seal his doom.    This circumstance was the arrival of a new band of Danes, who were, it  seems, more numerous, more ferocious, and more insatiable than any  who had come before them. The other kingdoms of the Saxons had been  already pretty effectually plundered. Alfred's kingdom of Wessex was  now, therefore, the most inviting field, and, after various excursions  of conquest and plunder in other parts of the island, they came like  an inundation over Alfred's frontiers, and all hope of resisting them  seems to have been immediately abandoned. The Saxon armies were broken  up. Alfred had lost, it appears, all influence and control over both  leaders and men. The chieftains and nobles fled. Some left the country  altogether; others hid themselves in the best retreats and fastnesses  that they could find. Alfred himself was obliged to follow the general  example. A few attendants, either more faithful than the rest, or else  more distrustful of their own resources, and inclined, accordingly, to  seek their own personal safety by adhering closely to their sovereign,  followed him. These, however, one after another, gradually forsook  him, and, finally, the fallen and deserted monarch was left alone.    In fact, it was a relief to him at last to be left alone; for they who  remained around him became in the end a burden instead of affording  him protection. They were too few to fight, and too many to be easily  concealed. Alfred withdrew himself from them, thinking that, under the  circumstances in which he was now placed, he was justified in seeking  his own personal safety alone. He had a wife, whom he married when he  was about twenty years old; but she was not with him now, though she  afterward joined him. She was in some other place of retreat. She  could, in fact, be much more easily concealed than her husband; for  the Danes, though they would undoubtedly have valued her very highly  as a captive, would not search for her with the eager and persevering  vigilance with which it was to be expected they would hunt for their  most formidable, but now discomfited and fugitive foe.    Alfred, therefore, after disentangling himself from all but one or two  trustworthy and faithful friends, wandered on toward the west, through  forests, and solitudes, and wilds, to get as far away as possible from  the enemies who were upon his track. He arrived at last on the remote  western frontiers of his kingdom, at a place whose name has been  immortalized by its having been for some time the place of his  retreat. It was called Athelney.[1] Athelney was, however, scarcely  deserving of a name, for it was nothing but a small spot of dry "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16546"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 2 (#16)"],[1,"as to the identity of the two works.

I will  now essay the more difficult task of arranging these phenomena in some  sort of chronological setting.    The voluminous Chinese literature concerning Buddhism offers valuable  assistance, for the Chinese, unlike the Hindus, have a natural  disposition to write simple narratives recording facts and dates. But  they are diarists and chroniclers rather than historians. The Chinese  pilgrims to India give a good account of their itinerary and  experiences, but they have little idea of investigating and arranging  past events and merely recount traditions connected with the places  which they visited. In spite of this their statements have  considerable historical value and on the whole harmonize with the  literary and archaelogical data furnished by India.    The Tibetan Lama Taranatha who completed his History of Indian  Buddhism[163] in 1608 is a less satisfactory authority. He merits  attention but also scepticism and caution. His work is a compilation  but is not to be despised on that ground, for the Tibetan translations  of Sanskrit works offer a rich mine of information about the history  of the Mahayana. Unfortunately few of these works take the historical  point of view and Taranatha's own method is as uncritical as his  materials. Dire confusion prevails as to chronology and even as to  names,[164] so that the work is almost useless as a connected account,  though it contains many interesting details.    Two epochs are of special importance for the development of later  Indian Buddhism, that of Kanishka and that of Vasubandhu and his  brother Asanga. The reader may expect me to discuss at length the date  of Kanishka's accession, but I do not propose to do so for it may be  hoped that in the next few years archaelogical research in India or  Central Asia will fix the chronology of the Kushans and meanwhile it  is waste of time to argue about probabilities or at any rate it can be  done profitably only in special articles. At present the majority of  scholars place his accession at about 78 A.D., others put it back to  58 B.C. and arrange the Kushan kings in a different order,[165] while  still others[166] think that he did not come to the throne until the  second century was well advanced. The evidence of art, particularly of  numismatics, indicates that Kanishka reigned towards the end of his  dynasty rather than at the beginning, but the use of Greek on his  coins and his traditional connection with the beginnings of the  Mahayana are arguments against a very late date. If the date 78 A.D.  is accepted, the conversion of the Yueeh-chih to Buddhism and its  diffusion in Central Asia cannot have been the work of Kanishka, for  Buddhism began to reach China by land about the time of the Christian  era.[167] There is however no reason to assume that they were his  work. Kanishka, like Constantine, probably favoured a winning cause,  and Buddhism may have been gradually making its way among the Kushans  and their neighbours for a couple of centuries before his time. In any  case, however important his reign may have been for the Buddhist  Church, I do not think that the history of the Mahayana should be made  to depend on his date. Chinese translations, supported by other  evidence, indicate that the Mahayanist movement had begun about the  time of our era. If it is proved that Kanishka lived considerably  later, we should not argue that Mahayanism is later than was supposed  but rather that his relation towards it has been misunderstood.[168]    The date of Vasubandhu has also been much discussed and scholars have  generally placed him in the fourth or fifth century but Peri[169]  appears to have proved that he lived from about 280 to 360 A.D. and I  shall adopt this view. This chronology makes a reasonable setting for  the development of Buddhism. If Kanishka reigned from about 78 to 123  A.D. or even later, there is no difficulty in supposing that  Asvaghosha flourished in his reign and was followed by Nagarjuna. The  collapse of the Kushan Empire was probably accompanied by raids from  Iranian tribes, for Persian influence appears to have been strong in  India during the confused interval between the Kushans and Guptas  (225-320). The latter inaugurated the revival of Hinduism but still  showed favour to individual Buddhists, and we know from Fa-Hsien that  Buddhism was fairly flourishing during his visit to India (399-415).  There is nothing improbable in supposing that Vasubandhu, who is  stated to have lived at Court, was patronized by the early Guptas. The  blank in Buddhist history which follows his career can be explained  first by the progress of Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism and  secondly by the invasions of the Huns. The Chinese pilgrim Sung-Yuen  has left us an account of India in this distressful period and for the  seventh century the works of Hsuean Chuang and I-Ching give copious  information.    In investigating the beginnings of the Mahayana we may start from the  epoch of Asoka, who is regarded by tradition as the patron and  consolidator of the Hinayanist Church. And the tradition seems on the  whole correct: the united evidence of texts and inscriptions goes to  show that the Buddhists of Asoka's time held the chief doctrines  subsequently professed by the Sinhalese Church and did not hold the  other set of doctrines known as Mahayanist. That these latter are  posterior in time is practically admitted by the books that teach  them, for they are constantly described as the crown and completion of  a progressive revelation. Thus the Lotus[170] illustrates the  evolution of doctrine by a story which curiously resembles the parable  of the prodigal son except that the returned penitent does not  recognize his father, who proceeds to reveal gradually his name and  position, keeping back the full truth to the last. Similarly it is  held in the Far East that there were five periods in Sakyamuni's  teaching which after passing through the stage of the Hinayana  culminated in the Prajna-paramita and Amitabha sutras shortly before  his death. Such statements admit the historical priority of the  Hinayana: it is rudimentary (that is early) truth which needs  completion and expansion. Many critics demur to the assumption that  primitive Buddhism was a system of ethics purged of superstition and  mythology. And in a way they are right. Could we get hold of a  primitive Buddhist, we should"]]]
