When he was about fifteen years of age, his father caused him  to be enlisted in the same company in which he served for some small  time before my Lord Cobham's expedition into Spain,[12] in which he  accompanied him. That expedition being over, Casey returned into  England, and did duty as usual in the Guards.    One night he, with some others, crossing the park a fray happened  between them and one John Stone, which as Casey affirmed at his death,  was occasioned by the prosecutor Stone offering very great indecencies  to him, upon which they in a fury beat and abused him, from the  abhorrence they pretended to have for that beastly and unnatural sin of  sodomy. Whether this was really the case or no is hard to determine; all  who were concerned in it with Casey being indicted (though not  apprehended) with him, and their evidence consequently taken. However  that matter was, Stone the prosecutor told a dreadful story on Casey's  trial. He said the four men attacked him crossing the Park, who  attacked, beat and cruelly trod upon and wounded him, taking from him at  the same time his hat, wig, neck-cloth and five shillings in money; and  that upon his arising and endeavouring to follow them, they turned back,  stamped upon him, broke one of his ribs, and told him that if he  attempted to stir, they would seize him and swear sodomy upon him. On  this indictment Casey was convicted and ordered for execution,  notwithstanding all the intercession his friends could make.    While under sentence he complained heavily of the pains a certain  corporal had taken in preparing and pressing the evidence against him.  He said his diligence proceeded not from any desire of doing justice, or  for his guilt, but from an old grudge he owed their family, from Casey's  father threatening to prosecute him for a rape committed on his  daughter, then very young, and attended with very cruel circumstances;  and which even the corporal himself had in part owned in a letter which  he had written to the said Casey's father. However, while he lay in  Newgate, he seemed heartily affected with sorrow for his misspent life,  which he said was consumed as is too frequent among soldiers, either in  idleness or vice. He added, that in Spain he had made serious  resolutions of amendment with himself, but was hindered from performing  them by his companions, who were continually seducing him into his old  courses. When he found that all hopes of life were lost, he disposed  himself to submit with decency to his fate, which disposition he  preserved to the last.    At the place of execution he behaved with great composure and said that  as he had heard he was accused in the world of having robbed and  murdered a woman in Hyde Park, he judged it proper to discharge his  conscience by declaring that he knew nothing of the murder, but said  nothing as to the robbery. At the time of his death, which was on the  11th of September, 1721, he was about twenty years of age, and according  to the character his officers gave him, a very quiet and orderly young  man. He left behind him a paper to be published to the world, which as  he was a dying man he averred to be the truth.        A copy of a paper left by William Casey.        Good People, I am now brought to this place to suffer a shameful and      ignominious death, and of all such unhappy persons, 'tis expected by      the world that they should either say something at their death, or      leave some account behind them. And having that which more nearly      concerns me, viz., the care of my immortal soul, I choose rather to      leave these lines behind me than to waste my few precious moments in      talking to the multitude. First, I declare, I die like a member,      though a very unworthy one, of the Church of England as by Law      established, the principles of which my now unhappy father took an      early care to instruct me in. And next for the robbery of Mr. Stone,      for which I am now brought to this fatal place. I solemnly do      declare to God and the world, that I never had the value of one      halfpenny from him, and that the occasion of his being so ill-used      was that he offered to me that detestable and crying sin of sodomy.        I take this opportunity, with almost my last breath, to give my      hearty thanks to the honourable Col. Pitts, and Col. Pagitt, for      their endeavours to save my life, and indeed I had some small hopes      that his Majesty, in consideration of the services of my whole      family, having all been faithful soldiers and servants to the Crown      of England, would have extended one branch of his mercy to me, and      have sent me to have served him in another country. But welcome be      the Grace of God, I am resigned to His will, and die in charity with      all men, forgiving, hoping to be forgiven myself, through the merits      of my blessed Saviour Jesus Christ. I hope, and make it my earnest      request that nobody will be so little Christian as to reflect on my      aged parents, wife, brother, or sisters, for my untimely end. And I      pray God, into whose hands I commend my spirit, that the great      number of sodomites in and about this City and suburbs, may not      bring down the same judgement from Heaven as fell on Sodom and      Gomorrah.        William Casey.    FOOTNOTES:       [12] Sir Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham, was a distinguished          general who had served under Marlborough. In 1719 he led an          expedition to the north coast of Spain and seized Vigo and the          neighbouring towns and harbours.          The Life of JOHN DYKES, a Thief and Highwayman      It is a reflection almost too common to be repeated that of all the  vices to which young people are addicted, nothing is so dangerous as a  habit and inclination to gaming. To explain this would be to swell a  volume. Instances which are so numerous do it much better. Perhaps this  unhappy person John Dykes is as strong a one as is anywhere to be met  with. His parents were persons in middling circumstances, but he being  their eldest child, they treated him with great indulgence, and to the  detriment of their own fortune afforded him a necessary education. When  he grew up and his friends thought of placing him out apprentice, he  always found some excuse or other to avoid it, which arose only from his  great indolence of temper, and his continual itching after gaming. When  he had money, he went to the gaming tables about town, and when reduced  by losses sustained there, would put on an old ragged coat and get out  to play at chuck, and span-farthing, amongst the boys in the street, by  which, sometimes he got money enough to go to his old companions again.  But this being a very uncertain recourse, he made use more frequently of  picking pockets; for which being several times apprehended and committed  to Bridewell, his friends, especially his poor father, would often  demonstrate to him the ignominious end which such practices would  necessarily bring on, entreating him while there was yet time, to  reflect and to leave them off, promising to do their utmost for him,  notwithstanding all that was past. In the course of this unhappy life  the youth had acquired an extraordinary share of cunning, and an unusual  capacity of dissembling; he employed it more than once to deceive his  family into a belief of his having made a thorough resolution of  amendment.    Once, after having suffered the usual discipline of the horsepond, Dykes  was carried before a Justice of Peace, and committed to Tothill Fields  Bridewell[13]. Here he became acquainted with one Jeddediah West, a  Quaker's son, who had fallen into the like practices, and for them  shared the same punishment with himself. They were pretty much of a  temper, but Jeddediah was the elder and much the more subtle of the two,  and in this unhappy place they contracted a strict and intimate  friendship. Out of shame Jeddediah forbore for two or three days to  acquaint his relations, and during that time for the most part subsisted  out of what Dykes got from home. But at last West picked up courage  enough to send to his brother, a very eminent man in business, and by  telling him a plausible story, procured not only pity and relief, but  even prevailed on him to believe that he was innocent of the fact for  which he was committed. He so well tutored his friend Dykes that though  he could not persuade his parents into the same degree of credulity, yet  his outward appearance of penitence induced them not only to pardon him  but to take him home, give him a new suit of clothes, and to promise  him, if he continued to do well, whatever was in their power to do for  him.    Dykes and his companion being in favour with their friends, and having  money in their pockets, continued their correspondence and went often to  the gaming tables together. At first they had a considerable run of luck  for about three weeks, but Fortune then forsaking them, they were  reduced to be downright penniless, without any hopes of relief or  assistance from their friends sufficient to carry on their expenses.  West at last proposed an expedient for raising money, which lay  altogether upon himself, and which he the next day executed in the  following manner.    About the time that he knew his brother was to come home from the  Exchange to dinner, he went to his house equipped in a sailor's  pea-jacket, his hair cropped short to his ears, his eyebrows coloured  black, and a handkerchief about his neck. As soon as he saw him in the  counting-house, his brother started back, and cried, _Bless me!  Jeddediah, how came you in this pickle?_ With all signs of grief and  confusion, he threw himself at his brother's feet, and told him with a  flood of tears that two coiners who had accidentally seen him in  Bridewell had sworn against him and three others on their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#16)"],[1,"very wealthy to boot, lived happily, keeping  more exact accounts, to the end of his days.      NOVEL X.    --  Pietro di Vinciolo goes from home to sup: his wife brings a boy into the  house to bear her company: Pietro returns, and she hides her gallant  under a hen-coop: Pietro explains that in the house of Ercolano, with  whom he was to have supped, there was discovered a young man bestowed  there by Ercolano's wife: the lady thereupon censures Ercolano's wife:  but unluckily an ass treads on the fingers of the boy that is hidden  under the hen-coop, so that he cries for pain: Pietro runs to the place,  sees him, and apprehends the trick played on him by his wife, which  nevertheless he finally condones, for that he is not himself free from  blame.  --    When the queen had done speaking, and all had praised God that He had  worthily rewarded Federigo, Dioneo, who never waited to be bidden, thus  began:--I know not whether I am to term it a vice accidental and  superinduced by bad habits in us mortals, or whether it be a fault seated  in nature, that we are more prone to laugh at things dishonourable than  at good deeds, and that more especially when they concern not ourselves.  However, as the sole scope of all my efforts has been and still shall be  to dispel your melancholy, and in lieu thereof to minister to you  laughter and jollity; therefore, enamoured my damsels, albeit the ensuing  story is not altogether free from matter that is scarce seemly, yet, as  it may afford you pleasure, I shall not fail to relate it; premonishing  you my hearers, that you take it with the like discretion as when, going  into your gardens, you stretch forth your delicate hands and cull the  roses, leaving the thorns alone: which, being interpreted, means that you  will leave the caitiff husband to abide in sorry plight with his  dishonour, and will gaily laugh at the amorous wiles or his wife, and  commiserate her unfortunate gallant, when occasion requires.    'Tis no great while since there dwelt at Perugia a rich man named Pietro  di Vinciolo, who rather, perchance, to blind others and mitigate the evil  repute in which he was held by the citizens of Perugia, than for any  desire to wed, took a wife: and such being his motive, Fortune provided  him with just such a spouse as he merited. For the wife of his choice was  a stout, red-haired young woman, and so hot-blooded that two husbands  would have been more to her mind than one, whereas one fell to her lot  that gave her only a subordinate place in his regard. Which she  perceiving, while she knew herself to be fair and lusty, and felt herself  to be gamesome and fit, waxed very wroth, and now and again had high  words with her husband, and led but a sorry life with him at most times.  Then, seeing that thereby she was more like to fret herself than to  dispose her husband to conduct less base, she said to herself:--This poor  creature deserts me to go walk in pattens in the dry; wherefore it shall  go hard but I will bring another aboard the ship for the wet weather. I  married him, and brought him a great and goodly dowry, knowing that he  was a man, and supposing him to have the desires which men have and ought  to have; and had I not deemed him to be a man, I should never have  married him. He knew me to be a woman: why then took he me to wife, if  women were not to his mind? 'Tis not to be endured. Had I not been minded  to live in the world, I had become a nun; and being minded there to live,  as I am, if I am to wait until I have pleasure or solace of him, I shall  wait perchance until I am old; and then, too late, I shall bethink me to  my sorrow that I have wasted my youth; and as to the way in which I  should seek its proper solace I need no better teacher and guide than  him, who finds his delight where I should find mine, and finds it to his  own condemnation, whereas in me 'twere commendable. 'Tis but the laws  that I shall set at nought, whereas he sets both them and Nature herself  at nought.    So the good lady reasoned, and peradventure more than once; and then,  casting about how she might privily compass her end, she made friends  with an old beldam, that shewed as a veritable Santa Verdiana,  foster-mother of vipers, who was ever to be seen going to pardonings with  a parcel of paternosters in her hand, and talked of nothing but the lives  of the holy Fathers, and the wounds of St. Francis, and was generally  reputed a saint; to whom in due time she opened her whole mind. \"My  daughter,\" replied the beldam, \"God, who knows all things, knows that  thou wilt do very rightly indeed: were it for no other reason, 'twould be  meet for thee and every other young woman so to do, that the heyday of  youth be not wasted; for there is no grief like that of knowing that it  has been wasted. And what the devil are we women fit for when we are old  except to pore over the cinders on the hearth? The which if any know, and  may attest it, 'tis I, who, now that I am old, call to mind the time that  I let slip from me, not without most sore and bitter and fruitless  regret: and albeit 'twas not all wasted, for I would not have thee think  that I was entirely without sense, yet I did not make the best use of it:  whereof when I bethink me, and that I am now, even as thou seest me, such  a hag that never a spark of fire may I hope to get from any, God knows  how I rue it. Now with men 'tis otherwise: they are born meet for a  thousand uses, not for this alone; and the more part of them are of much  greater consequence in old age than in youth: but women are fit for  nought but this, and 'tis but for that they bear children that they are  cherished. Whereof, if not otherwise, thou mayst assure thyself, if thou  do but consider that we are ever ready for it; which is not the case with  men; besides which, one woman will tire out many men without being  herself tired out. Seeing then that 'tis for this we are born, I tell  thee again that thou wilt do very rightly to give thy husband thy loaf  for his cake, that in thy old age thy soul may have no cause of complaint  against thy flesh. Every one has just as much of this life as he  appropriates: and this is especially true of women, whom therefore it  behoves, much more than men, to seize the moment as it flies: indeed, as  thou mayst see for thyself, when we grow old neither husband, nor any  other man will spare us a glance; but, on the contrary, they banish us to  the kitchen, there to tell stories to the cat, and to count the pots and  pans; or, worse, they make rhymes about us:--'To the damsel dainty bits;  to the beldam ague-fits;' and such-like catches. But to make no more  words about it, I tell thee at once that there is no person in the world  to whom thou couldst open thy mind with more advantage than to me; for  there is no gentleman so fine but I dare speak my mind to him, nor any so  harsh and forbidding but I know well how to soften him and fashion him to  my will. Tell me only what thou wouldst have, and leave the rest to me:  but one word more: I pray thee to have me in kindly remembrance, for that  I am poor; and thou shalt henceforth go shares with me in all my  indulgences and every paternoster that I say, that God may make thereof  light and tapers for thy dead:\" wherewith she ended.    So the lady came to an understanding with the beldam, that, as soon as  she set eyes on a boy that often came along that street, and of whom the  lady gave her a particular description, she would know what she was to  do: and thereupon the lady gave her a chunk of salt meat, and bade her  God-speed. The beldam before long smuggled into the lady's chamber the  boy of whom she had spoken, and not long after another, such being the  humour of the lady, who, standing in perpetual dread of her husband, was  disposed, in this particular, to make the most of her opportunities. And  one of these days, her husband being to sup in the evening with a friend  named Ercolano, the lady bade the beldam bring her a boy as pretty and  dainty as was to be found in Perugia; and so the beldam forthwith did.  But the lady and the boy being set at table to sup, lo, Pietro's voice  was heard at the door, bidding open to him. Whereupon the lady gave  herself up for dead; but being fain, if she might, to screen the boy, and  knowing not where else to convey or conceal him, bestowed him under a  hen-coop that stood in a veranda hard by the chamber in which they were  supping, and threw over it a sorry mattress that she had that day emptied  of its straw; which done she hastened to open the door to her husband;  saying to him as he entered:--\"You have gulped your supper mighty quickly  to-night.\" Whereto Pietro replied:--\"We have not so much as tasted it.\"  \"How so?\" enquired the lady. \"I will tell thee,\" said Pietro. \"No sooner  were we set at table, Ercolano, his wife, and I, than we heard a sneeze  close to us, to which, though 'twas repeated, we paid no heed; but as the  sneezer continued to sneeze a third, a fourth, a fifth, and many another  time to boot, we all began to wonder, and Ercolano, who was somewhat out  of humour with his wife, because she had kept us a long time at the door  before she opened it, burst out in a sort of rage with:--'What means  this? Who is't that thus sneezes?' and made off to a stair hard by,  beneath which and close to its foot was a wooden closet, of the sort  which, when folk are furnishing their houses, they commonly cause to be  placed there, to stow things in upon occasion. And as it seemed to him  that the sneezing proceeded thence, he undid the wicket, and no sooner  had he opened it than out flew never so strong a stench of brimstone;  albeit we had already been saluted by a whiff of it, and complained  thereof, but had been put off by the lady with:--''Tis but that a while  ago I bleached my veils with brimstone, having sprinkled it on a dish,  that they might catch its fumes, which dish I then "]]]
