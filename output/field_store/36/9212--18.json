Sometimes  both are seen together on the twilight sky, and then Venus is generally  the brighter. Seen, however, at her brightest and at her greatest  elongation from the sun, her splendour scarcely exceeds that with which  Jupiter shines when high above the southern horizon at midnight.    Jupiter's satellites may be seen with very low powers; indeed the outer  ones have been seen with the naked eye, and all are visible in a good  opera-glass. Their dimensions relatively to the disc are shown in Plate  7. Their greatest elongations are compared with the disc in the  low-power view.    Jupiter's belts may also be well seen with moderate telescopic power.  The outer parts of his disc are perceptibly less bright than the centre.    More difficult of observation are the transits of the satellites and of  their shadows. Still the attentive observer can see the shadows with an  aperture of two inches, and the satellites themselves with an aperture  of three inches.    The minute at which the satellites enter on the disc, or pass off, is  given in 'Dietrichsen's Almanac.' The 'Nautical Almanac' also gives the  corresponding data for the shadows.    The eclipses of the satellites in Jupiter's shadow, and their  occultations by his disc, are also given in 'Dietrichsen's Almanac.'    In the inverting telescope the satellites move from right to left in the  nearer parts of their orbit, and therefore transit Jupiter's disc in  that direction, and from left to right in the farther parts. Also note  that _before_ opposition, (i.) the shadows travel in front of the  satellites in transiting the disc; (ii.) the satellites are eclipsed in  Jupiter's _shadow_; (iii.) they reappear from behind his _disc_. On the  other hand, _after_ opposition, (i.) the shadows travel _behind_ the  satellites in transiting the disc; (ii.) the satellites are occulted by  the _disc_; (iii.) they reappear from eclipse in Jupiter's _shadow_.    Conjunctions of the satellites are common phenomena, and may be waited  for by the observer who sees the chance. An eclipse of one satellite by  the shadow of another is not a common phenomenon; in fact, I have never  heard of such an eclipse being seen. That a satellite should be quite  extinguished by another's shadow is a phenomenon not absolutely  impossible, but which cannot happen save at long intervals.    The shadows are not _black spots_ as is erroneously stated in nearly all  popular works on astronomy. The shadow of the fourth, for instance, is  nearly all penumbra, the really black part being quite minute by  comparison. The shadow of the third has a considerable penumbra, and  even that of the first is not wholly black. These penumbras may not be  perceptible, but they affect the appearance of the shadows. For  instance, the shadow of the fourth is perceptibly larger but less black  than that of the third, though the third is the larger satellite.    In transit the first satellite moves fastest, the fourth slowest, the  others in their order. The shadow moves just as fast (appreciably) as  the satellite it belongs to. Sometimes the shadow of the satellite may  be seen to overtake (apparently) the disc of another. In such a case the  shadow does not pass over the disc, but the disc conceals the shadow.  This is explained by the fact that the shadow, if visible throughout its  length, would be a line reaching slantwise from the satellite it belongs  to, and the end of the shadow (that is, the point where it meets the  disc) is _not_ the point where the shadow crosses the orbit of any inner  satellite. Thus the latter may be interposed between the end of the  shadow--the only part of the shadow really visible--and the eye; but the  end of the shadow _cannot_ be interposed between the satellite and the  eye. If a satellite _on the disc_ were eclipsed by another satellite,  the black spot thus formed would be in another place from the black spot  on the planet's body. I mention all this because, simple as the question  may seem, I have known careful observers to make mistakes on this  subject. A shadow is seen crossing the disc and overtaking, apparently,  a satellite in transit. It seems therefore, on a first view, that the  shadow will hide the satellite, and observers have even said that they  have _seen_ this happen. But they are deceived. It is obvious that _if  one satellite eclipse another, the shadows of both must occupy the same  point on Jupiter's body_. Thus it is the overtaking of one _shadow_ by  another on the disc, and not the overtaking of a _satellite_ by a  shadow, which determines the occurrence of that as yet unrecorded  phenomenon, the eclipse of one satellite by another.[13]    The satellites when far from Jupiter seem to lie in a straight line  through his centre. But as a matter of fact they do not in general lie  in an exact straight line. If their orbits could be seen as lines of  light, they would appear, in general, as very long ellipses. The orbit  of the fourth would frequently be seen to be _quite clear_ of Jupiter's  disc, and the orbit of the third might in some very exceptional  instances pass _just_ clear of the disc. The satellites move most nearly  in a straight line (apparently) when Jupiter comes to opposition in the  beginning of February or August, and they appear to depart most from  rectilinear motion when opposition occurs in the beginning of May and  November. At these epochs the fourth satellite may be seen to pass above  and below Jupiter's disc at a distance equal to about one-sixth of the  disc's radius.    The shadows do not travel in the same apparent paths as the satellites  themselves across the disc, but (in an inverting telescope) _below_ from  August to January, and _above_ from February to July.    We come now to the most charming telescopic object in the heavens--the  planet Saturn. Inferior only to Jupiter in mass and volume, this planet  surpasses him in the magnificence of his system. Seen in a telescope of  adequate power, Saturn is an object of surpassing loveliness. He must be  an unimaginative man who can see Saturn for the first time in such a  telescope, without a feeling of awe and amazement. If there is any  object in the heavens--I except not even the Sun--calculated to impress  one with a sense of the wisdom and omnipotence of the Creator it is  this. \"His fashioning hand\" is indeed visible throughout space, but in  Saturn's system it is most impressively manifest.    Saturn, to be satisfactorily seen, requires a much more powerful  telescope than Jupiter. A good 2-inch telescope will do much, however,  in exhibiting his rings and belts. I have never seen him satisfactorily  myself with such an aperture, but Mr. Grover has not only seen the  above-named features, but even a penumbra to the shadow on the rings  with a 2-inch telescope.    Saturn revolving round the sun in a long period--nearly thirty  years--presents slowly varying changes of appearance (see Plate 7). At  one time the edge of his ring is turned nearly towards the earth; seven  or eight years later his rings are as much open as they can ever be;  then they gradually close up during a corresponding interval; open out  again, exhibiting a different face; and finally close up as first seen.  The last epoch of greatest opening occurred in 1856, the next occurs in  1870: the last epoch of disappearance occurred in 1862-63, the next  occurs in 1879. The successive views obtained are as in Plate 7 in order  from right to left, then back to the right-hand figure (but sloped the  other way); inverting the page we have this figure thus sloped, and the  following changes are now indicated by the other figures in order back  to the first (but sloped the other way and still inverted), thus  returning to the right-hand figure as seen without inversion.    The division in the ring can be seen in a good 2-inch aperture in  favourable weather. The dark ring requires a good 4-inch and good  weather.    Saturn's satellites do not, like Jupiter's, form a system of nearly  equal bodies. Titan, the sixth, is probably larger than any of  Jupiter's satellites. The eighth also (Japetus) is a large body,  probably at least equal to Jupiter's third satellite. But Rhea, Dione,  and Tethys are much less conspicuous, and the other three cannot be seen  without more powerful telescopes than those we are here dealing with.    So far as my own experience goes, I consider that the five larger  satellites may be seen distinctly in good weather with a good 3-1/2-inch  aperture. I have never seen them with such an aperture, but I judge from  the distinctness with which these satellites may be seen with a 4-inch  aperture. Titan is generally to be looked for at a considerable distance  from Saturn--_always_ when the ring is widely open. Japetus is to be  looked for yet farther from the disc. In fact, when Saturn comes to  opposition in perihelion (in winter only this can happen) Japetus may be  as far from Saturn as one-third of the apparent diameter of the moon. I  believe that under these circumstances, or even under less favourable  circumstances, Japetus could be seen with a good opera-glass. So also  might Titan.    Transits, eclipses, and occulations of Saturn's satellites can only be  seen when the ring is turned nearly edgewise towards the earth. For the  orbits of the seven inner satellites lying nearly in the plane of the  rings would (if visible throughout their extent) then only appear as  straight lines, or as long ellipses cutting the planet's disc.    The belts on Saturn are not very conspicuous. A good 3-1/2-inch is  required (so far as my experience extends) to show them satisfactorily.    The rings when turned edgewise either towards the earth or sun, are not  visible in ordinary telescopes, neither can they be seen when the earth  and sun are on opposite sides of the rings.

He  received me very coldly, and could not be induced to change his  mind. We left him at last with a very decided \"No.\" \"Of course,\"  he added, \"I am only the Bishop's delegate; if he allows you to  enter, I shall have nothing more to say.\"    When we came out of the Presbytery again, it was raining in  torrents, and my soul, too, was overcast with heavy clouds. Papa  did not know how to console me, but he promised, if I wished, to  take me to Bayeux to see the Bishop, and to this I eagerly  consented.    Many things happened, however, before we were able to go. To all  appearances my life seemed to continue as formerly. I went on  studying, and, what is more important, I went on growing in the  love of God. Now and then I experienced what were indeed raptures  of love.    One evening, not knowing in what words to tell Our Lord how much I  loved him, and how much I wished that He was served and honoured  everywhere, I thought sorrowfully that from the depths of hell  there does not go up to Him one single act of love. Then, from my  inmost heart, I cried out that I would gladly be cast into that  place of torment and blasphemy so that He might be eternally loved  even there. This could not be for His Glory, since He only wishes  our happiness, but love feels the need of saying foolish things.  If I spoke in this way, it was not that I did not long to go to  Heaven, but for me Heaven was nothing else than Love, and in my  ardour I felt that nothing could separate me from the Divine Being  Who held me captive.    About this time Our Lord gave me the consolation of an intimate  knowledge of the souls of children. I gained it in this way.  During the illness of a poor woman, I interested myself in her two  little girls, the elder of whom was not yet six. It was a real  pleasure to see how simply they believed all that I told them.  Baptism does indeed plant deeply in our souls the theological  virtues, since from early childhood the hope of heavenly reward is  strong enough to make us practise self-denial. When I wanted my  two little girls to be specially kind to one another, instead of  promising them toys and sweets, I talked to them about the eternal  recompense the Holy Child Jesus would give to good children. The  elder one, who was coming to the use of reason, used to look quite  pleased and asked me charming questions about the little Jesus and  His beautiful Heaven. She promised me faithfully always to give in  to her little sister, adding that all through her life she would  never forget what I had taught her. I used to compare these  innocent souls to soft wax, ready to receive any impression--evil,  alas! as well as good, and I understood the words of Our Lord: \"It  were better to be thrown into the sea than to scandalise one of  these little ones.\"[12]    How many souls might attain to great sanctity if only they were  directed aright from the first! I know God has not need of anyone  to help Him in His work of sanctification, but as He allows a  clever gardener to cultivate rare and delicate plants, giving him  the skill to accomplish it, while reserving to Himself the right  of making them grow, so does He wish to be helped in the  cultivation of souls. What would happen if an ignorant gardener  did not graft his trees in the right way? if he did not understand  the nature of each, and wished, for instance, to make roses grow  on peach trees?    This reminds me that I used to have among my birds a canary which  sang beautifully, and also a little linnet taken from the nest, of  which I was very fond. This poor little prisoner, deprived of the  teaching it should have received from its parents, and hearing the  joyous trills of the canary from morning to night, tried hard to  imitate them. A difficult task indeed for a linnet! It was  delightful to follow the efforts of the poor little thing; his  sweet voice found great difficulty in accommodating itself to the  vibrant notes of his master, but he succeeded in time, and, to my  great surprise, his song became exactly like the song of the  canary.    Oh, dear Mother, you know who taught me to sing from the days of  my earliest childhood! You know the voices which drew me on. And  now I trust that one day, in spite of my weakness, I may sing for  ever the Canticle of Love, the harmonious notes of which I have  often heard sweetly sounding here below.    But where am I? These thoughts have carried me too far, and I must  resume the history of my vocation.    On October 31, 1887, alone with Papa, I started for Bayeux, my  heart full of hope, but also excited at the idea of presenting  myself at the Bishop's house. For the first time in my life, I was  going to pay a visit without any of my sisters, and this to a  Bishop. I, who had never yet had to speak except to answer  questions addressed to me, would have to explain and enlarge on my  reasons for begging to enter the Carmel, and so give proofs of the  genuineness of my vocation.    It cost me a great effort to overcome my shyness sufficiently to  do this. But it is true that Love knows no such word as  \"impossible,\" for it deems \"all things possible, all things  allowed.\" Nothing whatsoever but the love of Jesus could have made  me face these difficulties and others which followed, for I had to  purchase my happiness by heavy trials. Now, it is true, I think I  bought it very cheaply, and I would willingly bear a thousand  times more bitter suffering to gain it, if it were not already  mine.    When we reached the Bishop's house, the floodgates of Heaven  seemed open once more. The Vicar-General, Father Reverony, who had  settled the date of our coming, received us very kindly, though he  looked a little surprised, and seeing tears in my eyes said:  \"Those diamonds must not be shown to His Lordship!\" We were led  through large reception-rooms which made me feel how small I was,  and I wondered what I should dare say. The Bishop was walking in a  corridor with two Priests. I saw the Vicar-General speak a few  words to him, then they came into the room where we were waiting.  There were three large armchairs in front of the fireplace, where  a bright fire blazed.    As his Lordship entered, my Father and I knelt for his blessing;  then he made us sit down. Father Reverony offered me the armchair  in the middle. I excused myself politely, but he insisted, telling  me to show if I knew how to obey. I did so without any more  hesitation, and was mortified to see him take an ordinary chair  while I was buried in an enormous seat that would comfortably have  held four children like me--more comfortably in fact, for I was  far from being at ease. I hoped that Papa was going to do all the  talking, but he told me to explain the reason of our visit. I did  so as eloquently as I could, though I knew well that one word from  the Superior would have carried more weight than all my reasons,  while his opposition told strongly against me. The Bishop asked  how long I had wanted to enter the Carmel. \"A very long time, my  Lord!\" \"Come!\" said the Vicar-General, laughing, \"it cannot be as  long as fifteen years.\" \"That is true,\" I answered, \"but it is not  much less, for I have wished to give myself to God from the time I  was three.\" The Bishop, no doubt to please Papa, tried to explain  that I ought to remain some time longer with him; but, to his  great surprise and edification, my Father took my part, adding  respectfully that we were going to Rome with the diocesan  pilgrimage, and that I should not hesitate to speak to the Holy  Father if I could not obtain permission before then. However, it  was decided that, previous to giving an answer, an interview with  the Superior was absolutely necessary. This was particularly  unpleasant hearing, for I knew his declared and determined  opposition; and, in spite of the advice not to allow the Bishop to  see any diamonds, I not only showed them but let them fall. He  seemed touched, and caressed me fondly. I was afterwards told he  had never treated any child so kindly.    \"All is not lost, little one,\" he said, \"but I am very glad that  you are going to Rome with your good Father; you will thus  strengthen your vocation. Instead of weeping, you ought to  rejoice. I am going to Lisieux next week, and I will talk to the  Superior about you. You shall certainly have my answer when you  are in Italy.\" His Lordship then took us to the garden, and was  much interested when Papa told him that, to make myself look  older, I had put up my hair for the first time that very morning.  This was not forgotten, for I know that even now, whenever the  Bishop tells anyone about his \"little daughter,\" he always repeats  the story about her hair. I must say I should prefer my little  secret to have been kept. As he took us to the door, the  Vicar-General remarked that such a thing had never been seen--a  father as anxious to give his child to God as the child was to  offer herself.    We had to return to Lisieux without a favourable answer. It seemed  to me as though my future were shattered for ever; the nearer I  drew to the goal, the greater my difficulties became. But all the  time I felt deep down in my heart a wondrous peace, because I knew  that I was only seeking the Will of my Lord.  ______________________________    [1] Cf. Psalm 18[19]:5.
