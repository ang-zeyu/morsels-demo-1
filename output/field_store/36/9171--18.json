She danced as had danced her Biblical sister to the pleasing of a king  for the attainment of her desire; and she danced humming a little tune  behind the veil until the movement of her beautiful body and the  knowledge of a man's eyes upon her went to her head like wine, so that  in the end, by force of habit maybe, she danced to conquer where she  had only intended to interest.    As already mentioned, she had the morals of a jackal.    She drifted down the court towards Hugh Carden Ali and, standing before  him, bowed her beautiful head to the level of her dimpled knees,  laughed gently, and was gone like a bird to a far corner of the court.    She seemed to swing in the air like a lime flower caught on the end of  a spider's thread, as she came slowly down once more; to be blown  hither and thither like a leaf before the gale as she ran here, sprang  there, to the rhythm of the little tune she hummed behind the wisp of  veil; to undulate, like a field of ripe wheat beneath the summer sun as  she stood quite near the man who watched her with a fraction of the  interest he would have shown in the purchase of a dog or falcon in the  open mart.    Her henna'd toes pressed firmly on the centre of a Persian rug of such  antiquity as to render the pattern indecipherable; she moved her body  from the slender waist downward not at all; the muscles of her arms and  shoulders rippled, and her head moved, slightly but unceasingly from  side to side.    How often one hears of the European's boredom whilst watching the  Nautch Dance in which the Indian Nautch girl, fully clothed, indeed in  high tight bodice and ankle-length, voluminous skirt, will drive her  native audience clean crazy with the tapping of her feet and slight,  undulating movements of the slender body and rod-like arms.  It is  indeed the dullest thing on earth to watch if you are unable to follow  and _interpret_ every little movement.  But if you can--well! the  unexpurgated version of the Arabian Nights will be as milk-and-water  compared to the heady brew offered for your consumption.  And the old  Harrovian sitting cross-legged, upon a heap of cushions, with the smoke  of the _nargileh_, drifting from between his lips, smiled as he picked  up the thread of the same old story which had been spun for him when,  an arrogant youth of twelve summers, he had ruled his house with no  gentle hand.    Otherwise he showed little interest and felt no desire to lift the  tantalising veil; neither did he turn his head, else might he have seen  the ebony face of the Ethiopian eunuch peering from between a mass of  flowers, from which point of vantage he watched the scene with intent  to report thereon to his black twin-brother.    At last, and very slowly, and with a growing feeling of resentment in  the place where her heart by rights should have been, Zulannah sped  down the court upon her toes and fell at the edge of the piled  cushions, causing the dogs to growl softly at her daring.    \"Thou art a beautiful dancer, woman,\" said Hugh Carden Ali, making no  movement to lift the veil.  \"Behold, I have passed a pleasant hour and  would reward thee.  What thou wilt.  Money--jewels?--speak.\"    From behind the wisp of veil which fluttered in the dancer's quick  breathing came the barely whispered answer.    \"I hear thee not, woman; raise thy voice and be not afraid.  I will  give thee what thou desirest.\"    \"One hour!\"    The man bent forward to catch the words, and when their full import  struck him, leapt to his feet and catching the woman's wrist jerked her  upright, ripping the veil from before her face.    \"_Zulannah_!\" he cried, and sprang back, having heard of the lady's  deft handling of her dagger when in the tantrums.  Then he caught both  wrists and held her pinioned, looking with loathing into the exquisite,  furious face, whilst the great dogs, fangs bared, ruffs upstanding,  sniffed suspiciously at the knees and waist, even rising on their  hind-legs to snuff the slender neck of this woman who had angered their  master.    For a second he held her with arms stretched to breaking-point and  henna'd toes barely touching the ground, then threw her across the  cushions, whilst the dogs growled softly as they prowled, belly to  ground, about the prostrate figure and the ebony-hued eunuch tore at  his woolly hirsute covering amongst the flowers.    But courtesans have tears as well as other kinds of women, and they use  them every whit as effectively, perhaps a bit better, on account of the  stoutness of their hearts.    So that when the man ordered the woman to sit up, she sat up, wiped  real tears from the innocent-looking eyes, re-arranged her garments,  and prepared for battle.    Tough might describe the rose-hued, satin-textured epidermis of the  scarlet enchantress.    \"Thou hast a great daring, woman.\"    The courtesan knew not the meaning of the word hesitation, and was off  with the still-born desire and on with her original business between  the tossing and falling of a drop from the perfumed fountain and ready  with an explanation even before the man spoke.    \"Thou hast misheard my words, lord.  Knowing by hearsay of thy hatred  of women, I entered thy house as dancer before thee, to gain as my  reward one hour of speech with thee.\"    \"Speech?  Wherefore?    \"Because I would help thee, and in helping thee help myself.\"  Clasping  her slender jewelled hands, across her bosom, she looked up to the  gilded ceiling, and sighing softly, whispered:    \"I love!\"    \"_Thou_!\"    \"Yea, lord.  I love--and--thou lovest--and--nay, hear me, it is for thy  advancement--and mine--and he, the man for whom my soul has turned to  water, for whom I yearn--yea, if it be but for one single hour of his  love--a memory of rose-time in the ash-pit of my years--he------\"  She  stopped.    'Tis wise to approach a wounded tiger warily, especially if you are not  certain as to the extent of the hurt or the power of the weapon of  defence in your hand.    \"Sit--and speak quickly, for I would have thee gone.\"    The man spoke curtly as he sank upon a pile of cushions and pointed to  one on the far side of the Persian rug, upon which the most courted  woman in Egypt knelt, with her eyes full of gentleness and her heart  pounding in a torment of rage and fear.    \"Yea, I understand.\"    Hugh Carden Ali spoke wearily, being stricken with love.  For ten solid  minutes the woman had talked round her subject.  Intuitive, she scented  danger; usually fearless, her whole being was sick with apprehension;  desperate, she dug her nails into her flesh and essayed to reach her  goal by a roundabout way.    Then she stopped, sighed, and cast down her eyes; then raised them  beseechingly when the man spoke.    \"Fearing to use force against the--the woman who thou sayest is loved  by the man thou lovest--and may the prophet bear witness that thy tale  is as full of turnings and twistings as the paths in the bazaar in  which thou spinn'st thy web--thou would'st tear her from him by craft.  Explain thy seemingly futile words, and hasten thy lying tongue, for  behold the hour of dawn approacheth.\"    And the wrath in the voice was such as to hurl the woman pell-mell over  the cliff of discretion down into the depths of her own undoing.    \"She, the white woman, walks in the bazaar, yea, even at noon and at  sunset.  Perchance one evening, lured by the tale of the riches of the  house of Zulannah, might not her feet stray within the portals at the  setting of the sun.  And behold, the key of the great door is within  these hands, and--and------\"    The man's hands lay quietly on his knees as he leant forward, and the  shadow thrown by the flowering plants hid the twin pools of murder in  the depths of his eyes.    \"And------?\" he whispered.    \"And------\" she whispered back, \"would the white man, thinkest thou,  take to wife her who had passed a night in the house of the courtesan?  Would he not, without waiting for explanation, throw her into the filth  of the bazaar, leaving her for the first comer to pick up, and turn  himself to------\"    She leapt to her feet, screaming, as his fingers closed round her wrist  in a grip of steel; mad with fury, she tore her raiment and hair,  raving obscenities in the vilest language of the lowest reaches of the  bazaar, oblivious of the dogs which reared and fell and reared  unceasingly behind her.    \"The white woman who trapeses the bazaar unveiled,\" she screamed.  \"The  white virgin who flung herself into thy arms, in the market-place, thou  trafficker in foreign harlots, the------\"    Hugh Carden Ali, the son of his father to the inner-most part of his  being in the horrible scene, had made one little sign, and the dogs  were upon her.    With a sickening scrunch one caught the side of her head in the steel  jaws which stretched from the nape of the neck to the corner of the  mouth; with a sharp snap the other drove its fangs into the muscle  behind the dimpled knee.    They pulled her down and stood stock-still, as these dogs are trained  to do; then with crimson saliva dripping from the jaws, crimson lights  shining in the eyes, let go their hold and stood looking alternately  from master to quarry, with slowly wagging tails.    There was no sign of anger in the man as he sat tranquilly upon the  cushions, the amber mouthpiece of the _nargileh_ between his lips; no  sound of wrath in the gentle voice which bid the Ethiopian eunuch to  remain prostrated upon the floor, until the arrival of the other  slaves, who could be heard pelting through the house from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15729"],[0,"History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Volume 2 [of 3] (#16)"],[1,"in an  \"Imperial Act of Grace\": the imprisoned Jews were set at liberty, the  penal conscripts were returned from service, several local officials  were put on trial, and the governor of Moghilev was severely censured.    This took place in November, 1844, after the Mstislavl community had for  nine long months tasted the horrors of a state of siege. The synagogues  were filled with Jews praising God for the relief granted to them. The  community decreed to commemorate annually the day before Purim, on which  the ukase inflicting severe punishment on the Jews of Mstislavl was  promulgated, as a day of fasting and to celebrate the third day of the  month of Kislev, on which the cruel ukase was revoked, as a day of  rejoicing. Had all the disasters of that era been perpetuated in the  same manner, the Jewish calendar would consist entirely of these  commemorations of national misfortunes, whether in the form of  \"ordinary\" persecutions or \"extraordinary\" afflictions.          CHAPTER XV      THE JEWS IN THE KINGDOM OF POLAND    1. PLANS OF JEWISH EMANCIPATION    Special mention must be made of the position occupied by the Jews in the  vast province which had be n formed in 1815 out of the territory of the  former duchy of Warsaw and annexed by Russia under the name of \"Kingdom  of Poland.\" [1] This province which from 1815 to 1830 enjoyed full  autonomy, with a local government in Warsaw and a parliamentary  constitution, handled the affairs of its large Jewish population,  numbering between three hundred to four hundred thousand souls,  independently and without regard to the legislation of the Russian  Empire, Even after the insurrection of 1830, when subdued Poland was  linked more closely with the Empire, the Jews continued to be subject to  a separate provincial legislation. The Jews of the Kingdom remained  under the tutelage of local guardians who were assiduously engaged in  solving the Jewish problem during the first part of this period.    [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p. 390, n. 1.]    The initial years of autonomous Poland were a time of storm and stress.  After having experienced the vicissitudes of the period of partitions  and the hopes and disappointments of the Napoleonic era, the Polish  people clutched eagerly at the shreds of political freedom which were  left to it by Alexander I. in the shape of the \"Constitutional  Regulation\" of 1815.[1] The Poles brought to bear upon the upbuilding of  the new kingdom all the ardor of their national soul and all their  enthusiasm for political regeneration. The feverish organizing activity  between 1815 and 1820 was attended by a violent outburst of national  sentiment, and such moments of enthusiasm were always accompanied in  Poland by an intolerant and unfriendly attitude towards the Jews. With a  few shining exceptions, the Polish statesmen were far removed from the  idea of Jewish emancipation. They favored either \"correctional\" or  punitive methods, though modelled after the pattern of Western European  rather than of primitive Russian anti-Semitism.    [Footnote 1: The author refers to the Constitution granted by Alexander  I., on November 15, 1815, to the Polish territories ceded to him by the  Congress of Vienna. The Constitution vouchsafed to Poland an autonomous  development under Russian auspices. It was withdrawn after the  insurrection of 1830.]    In 1815 the Provisional Government in Warsaw appointed a special  committee, under the chairmanship of Count Adam Chartoryski, to consider  the agrarian and the Jewish problem. The Committee drew up a general  plan of Jewish reorganization which was marked by the spirit of  enlightened patronage. In theory the Committee was ready to concede to  the Jews human and civil rights, even to the point of considering the  necessity of their final emancipation. But \"in view of the ignorance,  the prejudices and the moral corruption to be observed among the lower  classes of the Jewish and the Polish people\"--the patrician members of  the Committee in charge of the agrarian and Jewish problem accorded an  equal share of compliments to the Jews and the Polish peasants--immediate  emancipation was, in their opinion, bound to prove harmful, since it  would confer upon the Jews freedom of action to the detriment of the  country. It was, therefore, necessary to demand, as a prerequisite for  Jewish emancipation, the improvement of the Jewish masses which was  to be effected by removal from the injurious liquor trade and inducement  to engage in agriculture, by abolishing the Kahals, i.e., their communal  autonomy, and by changing the Jewish school system to meet the civic  requirements. In order to gain the confidence of the Jews for the  proposed reforms, the Committee suggested that the Government should  invite the \"enlightened\" representatives of the Jewish people to  participate in the discussion of the projected measures of reform.    Turning their eyes towards the West, where Jewish assimilation had  already begun its course, the Polish Committee decided to approach the  Jewish reformer David Frielaender, of Berlin, who was, so to speak, the  official philosopher of Jewish emancipation, and to solicit his opinion  concerning the ways and means of bringing about a reorganization of  Jewish life in Poland. The bishop of Kuyavia,[1] Malchevski, addressed  himself in the name of the Polish Government to Friedlaender, calling  upon him, as a pupil of Mendelssohn, the educator of Jewry, to state his  views on the proposed Jewish reforms in Poland. Flattered by this  invitation, Friedlaender hastened to compose an elaborate \"Opinion on the  Improvement of the Jews in the Kingdom of Poland.\" [2]    [Footnote 1: A former Polish province, compare Vol. I, p. 75, n. 2.]    [Footnote 2: It was written in February, 1816, and published later in  1819.]    According to Friedlaender, the Polish Jews had in point of culture  remained far behind their Western coreligionists, because their progress  had been hampered by their talmudic training, the pernicious doctrine of  Hasidism, and the self-government of their Kahals. All these influences  ought, therefore, to be combated. The Jewish school should be brought  into closer contact with the Polish school, the Hebrew language should  be replaced by the language of the country, and altogether assimilation  and religious reform should be encouraged. While promoting religious and  cultural reforms, the Government, in the opinion of Friedlaender, ought  to confirm the Jews in the belief that they would \"receive in time civil  rights if they were to endeavor to perfect themselves in the spirit of  the regulations issued for them.\"      This flunkeyish notion of the necessity of _deserving_ civil rights    coincided with the views of the official Polish Committee in Warsaw.    Soon afterwards a memorandum, prepared by the Committee, was    submitted through its Chairman, Count Chartoryski, to the Polish    viceroy Zayonchek. [1] Formerly a comrade of Koszciuszko, Zayonchek    later turned from a revolutionary into a reactionary, who was    anxious to curry favor with the supreme commander of the province,    Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich. [2] No wonder, therefore, that the    plan of the Committee, conservative though it was, seemed too    liberal for his liking. In his report to Emperor Alexander I., dated    March 8, 1816, he wrote as follows:    [Footnote 1: He was appointed viceroy in 1815, after the formation of  the Kingdom of Poland, and continued in this office until his death in  1826.]    [Footnote 2: He was the military commander of the province. See above,  p. 13, n. 2.]      The growth of the Jewish population in your Kingdom of Poland is    becoming a menace. In 1790 they formed here a thirteenth part of the    whole population; to-day they form no less than an eighth. Sober and    resourceful, they are satisfied with little; they earn their    livelihood by cheating, and, owing to early marriages, multiply    beyond measure. Shunning hard labor, they produce nothing    themselves, and live only at the expense of the working classes    which they help to ruin. Their peculiar institutions keep them apart    within the state, marking them as a foreign nationality, and, as a    result, they are unable in their present condition to furnish the    state either with good citizens or with capable soldiers. Unless    means are adopted to utilize for the common weal the useful    qualities of the Jews, they will soon exhaust all the sources of the    national wealth and will threaten to surpass and suppress the    Christian population.    In the same year, 1816, a scheme looking to the solution of the Jewish  question was proposed by the Russian statesman Nicholas Novosiltzev, the  imperial commissioner attached to the Provincial Government in  Warsaw.[1] Novosiltzev, who was not sympathetic to the Poles, showed  himself in his project to be a friend of the Jews. Instead of the  principle laid down by the official Committee: \"correction first, and  civil rights last,\" he suggests another more liberal procedure: the  immediate bestowal of civil and in part even political rights upon the  Jews, to be accompanied by a reorganization, of Jewish life along the  lines of European progress and a modernized scheme of autonomy. All  communal and cultural affairs shall be put in charge of \"directorates,\"  one central directorate in Warsaw and local ones in every province of  the Kingdom, after the pattern of the Jewish consistories of France.  These directorates shall be composed of rabbis, elders of the community,  and a commissioner representing the Government; in the central  directorate this commissioner shall be replaced by a \"procurator\" to be  appointed directly by the king.    [Footnote 1: See above, p. 16.]    This whole organization shall be placed under the jurisdiction of the  Minister of Public Instruction, who shall also exercise the right of  confirming the"]]]
