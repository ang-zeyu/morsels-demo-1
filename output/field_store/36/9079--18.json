Yet the devout adorer of an actual idol can even discover signs of  approbation in the rigid and immovable features of a marble image;  and it is no wonder that something, which could be as favourably  interpreted, glanced from the bright eye of the lovely Edith, whose  beauty, indeed, consisted rather more in that very power of expression,  than an absolute regularity of contour or brilliancy of complexion. Some  slight marks of distinction had escaped from her, notwithstanding her  own jealous vigilance, else how could Sir Kenneth have so readily and  so undoubtingly recognized the lovely hand, of which scarce two fingers  were visible from under the veil, or how could he have rested so  thoroughly assured that two flowers, successively dropped on the spot,  were intended as a recognition on the part of his lady-love? By what  train of observation--by what secret signs, looks, or gestures--by what  instinctive freemasonry of love, this degree of intelligence came to  subsist between Edith and her lover, we cannot attempt to trace; for we  are old, and such slight vestiges of affection, quickly discovered by  younger eyes, defy the power of ours. Enough that such affection  did subsist between parties who had never even spoken to one  another--though, on the side of Edith, it was checked by a deep sense of  the difficulties and dangers which must necessarily attend the further  progress of their attachment; and upon that of the knight by a thousand  doubts and fears lest he had overestimated the slight tokens of the  lady's notice, varied, as they necessarily were, by long intervals  of apparent coldness, during which either the fear of exciting the  observation of others, and thus drawing danger upon her lover, or that  of sinking in his esteem by seeming too willing to be won, made her  behave with indifference, and as if unobservant of his presence.    This narrative, tedious perhaps, but which the story renders necessary,  may serve to explain the state of intelligence, if it deserves so strong  a name, betwixt the lovers, when Edith's unexpected appearance in the  chapel produced so powerful an effect on the feelings of her knight.        CHAPTER V.         Their necromantic forms in vain       Haunt us on the tented plain;       We bid these spectre shapes avaunt,       Ashtaroth and Termagaunt.     WARTON.    The most profound silence, the deepest darkness, continued to brood for  more than an hour over the chapel in which we left the Knight of the  Leopard still kneeling, alternately expressing thanks to Heaven and  gratitude to his lady for the boon which had been vouchsafed to him.  His own safety, his own destiny, for which he was at all times little  anxious, had not now the weight of a grain of dust in his reflections.  He was in the neighbourhood of Lady Edith; he had received tokens of her  grace; he was in a place hallowed by relics of the most awful sanctity.  A Christian soldier, a devoted lover, could fear nothing, think of  nothing, but his duty to Heaven and his devoir to his lady.    At the lapse of the space of time which we have noticed, a shrill  whistle, like that with which a falconer calls his hawk, was heard to  ring sharply through the vaulted chapel. It was a sound ill suited to  the place, and reminded Sir Kenneth how necessary it was he should be  upon his guard. He started from his knee, and laid his hand upon his  poniard. A creaking sound, as of a screw or pulleys, succeeded, and a  light streaming upwards, as from an opening in the floor, showed that  a trap-door had been raised or depressed. In less than a minute a long,  skinny arm, partly naked, partly clothed in a sleeve of red samite,  arose out of the aperture, holding a lamp as high as it could stretch  upwards, and the figure to which the arm belonged ascended step by step  to the level of the chapel floor. The form and face of the being who  thus presented himself were those of a frightful dwarf, with a large  head, a cap fantastically adorned with three peacock feathers, a  dress of red samite, the richness of which rendered his ugliness more  conspicuous, distinguished by gold bracelets and armlets, and a white  silk sash, in which he wore a gold-hilted dagger. This singular figure  had in his left hand a kind of broom. So soon as he had stepped from  the aperture through which he arose, he stood still, and, as if to show  himself more distinctly, moved the lamp which he held slowly over  his face and person, successively illuminating his wild and fantastic  features, and his misshapen but nervous limbs. Though disproportioned in  person, the dwarf was not so distorted as to argue any want of strength  or activity. While Sir Kenneth gazed on this disagreeable object, the  popular creed occurred to his remembrance concerning the gnomes or  earthly spirits which make their abode in the caverns of the earth; and  so much did this figure correspond with ideas he had formed of their  appearance, that he looked on it with disgust, mingled not indeed with  fear, but that sort of awe which the presence of a supernatural creature  may infuse into the most steady bosom.    The dwarf again whistled, and summoned from beneath a companion. This  second figure ascended in the same manner as the first; but it was  a female arm in this second instance which upheld the lamp from the  subterranean vault out of which these presentments arose, and it was a  female form, much resembling the first in shape and proportions,  which slowly emerged from the floor. Her dress was also of red samite,  fantastically cut and flounced, as if she had been dressed for some  exhibition of mimes or jugglers; and with the same minuteness which her  predecessor had exhibited, she passed the lamp over her face and person,  which seemed to rival the male's in ugliness. But with all this most  unfavourable exterior, there was one trait in the features of both which  argued alertness and intelligence in the most uncommon degree. This  arose from the brilliancy of their eyes, which, deep-set beneath black  and shaggy brows, gleamed with a lustre which, like that in the eye  of the toad, seemed to make some amends for the extreme ugliness of  countenance and person.    Sir Kenneth remained as if spellbound, while this unlovely pair, moving  round the chapel close to each other, appeared to perform the duty of  sweeping it, like menials; but as they used only one hand, the floor was  not much benefited by the exercise, which they plied with such oddity of  gestures and manner as befitted their bizarre and fantastic appearance.  When they approached near to the knight in the course of their  occupation, they ceased to use their brooms; and placing themselves side  by side, directly opposite to Sir Kenneth, they again slowly shifted the  lights which they held, so as to allow him distinctly to survey features  which were not rendered more agreeable by being brought nearer, and to  observe the extreme quickness and keenness with which their black and  glittering eyes flashed back the light of the lamps. They then turned  the gleam of both lights upon the knight, and having accurately surveyed  him, turned their faces to each other, and set up a loud, yelling laugh,  which resounded in his ears. The sound was so ghastly that Sir Kenneth  started at hearing it, and hastily demanded, in the name of God, who  they were who profaned that holy place with such antic gestures and  elritch exclamations.    \"I am the dwarf Nectabanus,\" said the abortion-seeming male, in a voice  corresponding to his figure, and resembling the voice of the night-crow  more than any sound which is heard by daylight.    \"And I am Guenevra, his lady and his love,\" replied the female, in tones  which, being shriller, were yet wilder than those of her companion.    \"Wherefore are you here?\" again demanded the knight, scarcely yet  assured that they were human beings which he saw before him.    \"I am,\" replied the male dwarf, with much assumed gravity and dignity,  \"the twelfth Imaum. I am Mohammed Mohadi, the guide and the conductor of  the faithful. A hundred horses stand ready saddled for me and my train  at the Holy City, and as many at the City of Refuge. I am he who shall  bear witness, and this is one of my houris.\"    \"Thou liest!\" answered the female, interrupting her companion, in tones  yet shriller than his own; \"I am none of thy houris, and thou art no  such infidel trash as the Mohammed of whom thou speakest. May my curse  rest upon his coffin! I tell thee, thou ass of Issachar, thou art King  Arthur of Britain, whom the fairies stole away from the field of Avalon;  and I am Dame Guenevra, famed for her beauty.\"    \"But in truth, noble sir,\" said the male, \"we are distressed princes,  dwelling under the wing of King Guy of Jerusalem, until he was driven  out from his own nest by the foul infidels--Heaven's bolts consume  them!\"    \"Hush,\" said a voice from the side upon which the knight had  entered--\"hush, fools, and begone; your ministry is ended.\"    The dwarfs had no sooner heard the command than, gibbering in discordant  whispers to each other, they blew out their lights at once, and left the  knight in utter darkness, which, when the pattering of their retiring  feet had died away, was soon accompanied by its fittest companion, total  silence.    The knight felt the departure of these unfortunate creatures a relief.  He could not, from their language, manners, and appearance, doubt that  they belonged to the degraded class of beings whom deformity of person  and weakness of intellect recommended to the painful situation of  appendages to great families, where their personal appearance and  imbecility were food for merriment to the household.

In this way not a particle of the dressed animal  is wasted.    Here are a few ways to utilize the cuts that are really \"left-overs.\"      GOULASH      2 Pounds of meat scraps which can consist of beef, veal or pork.    2 Ounces of any fat.    2 Onions chopped fine.    1 Stalk celery, cut in small pieces.    2 Carrots.    2 Cups tomatoes either canned or fresh.    1 Bay leaf.    6 Whole cloves.    6 Peppercorns.    1 Blade mace or a little thyme or both.    A little flour.    1 Tablespoonful chopped parsley.    Salt and paprika to taste.    Cut the meat into one inch squares and roll in flour. Melt the fat in  the frying pan, add the vegetables (onions, celery, carrots) and brown  lightly: add the meat and brown. Stir with a spoon or fork to prevent  burning. When browned empty into a pan.    Put the bay leaf, cloves, peppercorns, mace and thyme into a  cheesecloth bag and add to the meat, add tomatoes. Cover with soup  stock or water and simmer 45 minutes if it is going to be canned. If  for immediate use, 2 hours will be necessary to thoroughly cook it.    Remove the spices, season with salt, paprika and the chopped parsley.  You can add Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce if desired. Use only  small quantities as these sauces are very strong in their distinctive  flavor. Put hot mixture into cans and sterilize.    If the different spices are not at hand a good goulash can be made by  using the meat, fat, onions, tomatoes, flour, salt and pepper and  omitting the rest of the recipe.      LIVER SAUSAGE    Beef, veal, or hog liver. Remove the membrane and cut away the large  blood vessels. Soak in water 1 to 2 hours to draw out blood. Boil  until done. When cooled put through a food chopper or grate finely.  Take half as much boiled fat pork as liver. Divide this fat into two  portions; chop one portion into one-quarter inch cubes; pass the other  portion through the food chopper; mix all together thoroughly; add  salt, ground cloves, pepper, and a little grated onion to taste. A  little thyme and marjoram may be added to suit taste. (For a liver  weighing 11/2 pounds add 3/4 pounds fat pork, 3 to 4 teaspoonfuls salt, 1/2  teaspoonful cloves, 1/2 teaspoonful pepper, 1 small onion, 1/4 teaspoonful  thyme, and pinch of marjoram.) This mixture is stuffed into large  casings. (If no casings are available, make casings of clean white  muslin.) Cover with boiling water, bring to a boil, and boil for 10  minutes. Pack into cans, fill in with the water in which the sausages  were boiled. Sterilize.    This liver sausage may also be made from the raw liver and raw pork,  but in that case the sterilizing is for a longer period, as the  time-table indicates. This recipe is recommended by the United States  Department of Agriculture.      HEAD CHEESE    Cut a hog's head into four pieces. Remove the brains, ears, skin,  snout and eyes. Cut off the fattest parts for lard. Put the lean and  bony parts to soak over night in cold water in order to extract the  blood and dirt. When the head is cleaned put it over the fire to boil,  using water enough to cover it. Boil until the meat separates readily  from the bones. Then remove it from the fire and pick out all the  bones. Drain off the liquor, saving a part of it for future use. Chop  the meat up finely with a chopping knife. Return it to the kettle and  pour on enough of the liquor to cover the meat. Let it boil slowly for  fifteen minutes to a half-hour. Season to taste with salt and pepper  just before removing it from the fire. Bay leaves, a little ground  cloves and allspice may be added and boiled a short time in the soup.  Pack while hot in cans to within 1/2 inch of top. Sterilize. This head  cheese is always served cold.      CORNED BEEF    After beef has been properly corned for three weeks, remove the meat  from the brine. Soak for two hours in clear water, changing water  once. Place in a wire basket and boil slowly for half an hour. Remove  from the boiling water, plunge into cold water, and remove gristle,  bone and excessive fat. Cut into small pieces and pack closely into  cans. Add no salt and proceed as in other canning.      CANNED PORK    After the animal has been killed, cool quickly and keep the pork cool  for at least 24 hours. Can only lean portions, using the fat to make  lard. Place meat in a wire basket or cheesecloth and boil 30 minutes,  or roast in the oven for 30 minutes. Cut into small sections and pack  closely into cans. Add salt and proceed with remainder of process.    Other pieces of beef and pork: Hamburg steak, sausage, venison,  squirrel, raccoon, opossum, lamb, are canned as follows:    After cleaning, season and fry, roast, stew, or bake in oven as though  preparing for serving directly on the table. Cook until meat is about  three fourths done. Pack while hot into sanitary tin cans or glass  jars. Pour over the meat the hot liquids, gravies, dressings, etc., or  hot water. Add salt and proceed as in any other cold-pack canning.      HOW TO CAN POULTRY AND GAME WITH THE BONES REMOVED    Kill bird and draw immediately; wash carefully and cool; then cut into  convenient sections. Boil until the meat can be removed from the  bones; remove from the boiling liquid and take out all bones; pack  closely into glass jars or enameled cans; fill jars with the hot  liquid after it has been concentrated one half; add 1 level  teaspoonful salt to every quart of meat for seasoning; put rubbers and  top of jars in place but not tight. If using enameled cans completely  seal. Sterilize the length of time given in the time-table on page  108 of this book. After the sterilizing remove the jars; tighten the  covers if glass was used; invert to cool and test joints. Wrap with  paper to prevent bleaching.      FRIED SPRING CHICKEN    After cleaning and preparing the chickens, season and fry as though  for serving directly on the table. Cook until the meat is about  three-fourths done. If a whole spring chicken, break the neck and both  legs and fold around body of chicken. Roll up tight, tie a string  around the chicken and drop this hot, partially fried product into  sanitary tin cans or glass jars. A quart tin can (No. 3) will hold two  to four small chickens. Pour liquid from the griddle or frying pan  into the can over the chicken. Proceed, as in any other canning, with  the sealing, sterilizing and removing of the jars. Chicken fries  canned in the late fall preserve the meat at the most delicious stage  and furthermore we avoid the expense of feeding the chickens  throughout the winter.      HOW TO CAN COCKERELS    When cockerels reach the point in their growth where it is no longer  profitable to feed them, and when they are wanted for home use during  the winter months they should be canned. This method of handling the  cockerel not only saves money by cutting down the feed bill, but it  places in the pantry or cellar the means of a delicious chicken dinner  at a time of the year when the price of poultry is high.    The bird should not be fed for at least twenty-four hours before  killing. It should be killed by the approved method and picked dry.  When the feathers have been removed and the pin feathers drawn the  bird should be cooled rapidly. This rapid cooling after killing is  essential to a good flavor in canned meat. As soon as the bird has  been properly cooled it should be singed and washed carefully with a  brush.      CUTTING UP AND DRAWING CHICKENS    Mr. George Farrell, a most expert canner, tells us how to go about  this job of canning chicken.    In preparing the bird for canning, care should be taken in drawing it  so that the contents of the digestive tract do not come in contact  with the meat.    1. Remove the tops of the wings, cutting at the first joint.    2. Remove the wings.    3. Remove the foot, cutting at the knee joint.    4. Remove the leg, cutting at the hip or saddle joint.    5. Cut the removed portion of the leg into two parts at the joint.    6. Place the bird so the back of the head is toward the operator, cut  through the neck bone with a sharp knife but do not cut the windpipe  or gullet.    7. With the index finger separate the gullet and windpipe from the  skin of the neck.    8. Cut through the skin of the neck.    9. With a pointed knife cut through the skin from the upper part of  the neck, thus separated, to the wing.    10. Leave the head attached to the gullet and windpipe and loosen  these from the neck down as far as the crop.    11. With a sharp pointed knife cut around the shoulder blade, pull it  out of position and break it.    12. Find the white spots on the ribs and cut through the ribs on these  white spots.    13. Cut back to the vent; cut around it, and loosen.    14. Begin at the crop and remove the digestive tract from the bird,  pulling it back toward the vent.    15. Remove the lungs and kidneys with the point of a knife.    16. Cut off the neck close to the body.    17. Cut through the backbone at the joint or just above the diaphragm.    18. Remove the oil sack.    19. Separate the breast from the backbone by cutting through on the  white spots.    20. Cut the fillet from each side of the breastbone.    21. Cut in sharp at the point of the breastbone, turning the knife and  cutting away the wishbone with the meat. Bend in the bones of the  breastbone.      PACKING CHICKEN    Use a one quart jar. Caution: Do not pack the giblets with the meat.    1. Have the jar hot.    2. Pack the saddle with a thigh inside.    3. Pack the breastbone with a thigh inside.    4. Pack the backbone and ribs with a leg inside.    5. Pack the legs large end downward, alongside the breastbone.    6. Pack the wings.    7. Pack the wishbone.    8. Pack the fillets.    9. Pack the neck-bone.    10. Pour on boiling water to within one inch of the top; add a level  teaspoonful of salt; place the rubber and cap in position, partially  seal, and"]]]
