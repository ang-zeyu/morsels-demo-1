[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#16)"],[1," for a few rare passages it does not fall as low as the atrocities which  disfigure the grandiose _Mass in D_, the vocal part of the _Requiem_ is  awkwardly written. Singers are ill at ease in it, for the timbre and  regularity of the voice resent such treatment. The tenor's part is so  written that he is to be congratulated on getting through it without any  accident, and nothing more can be expected of him.    What a pity it was that Berlioz did not fall in love with an Italian  singer instead of an English tragedienne! Cupid might have wrought a  miracle. The author of the _Requiem_ would have lost none of his good  qualities, but he might have gained, what, for the lack of a better  phrase, is called the fingering of the voice, the art of handling it  intelligently and making it give without an effort the best effect of  which it is capable. But Berlioz had a horror even of the Italian  language, musical as that is. As he said in his _Memoirs_, this aversion  hid from him the true worth of _Don Juan_ and _Le Nozze di Figaro_. One  wonders whether he knew that his idol, Gluck, wrote music for Italian  texts not only in the case of his first works but also in _Orphee_ and  _Alceste_. And whether he knew that the aria _\"O malheureuse Iphigenie\"_  was an Italian song badly translated into French. Perhaps he was  ignorant of all this in his youth for Berlioz was a genius, not a  scholar.    The word genius tells the whole story. Berlioz wrote badly. He  maltreated voices and sometimes permitted himself the strangest freaks.  Nevertheless he is one of the commanding figures of musical art. His  great works remind us of the Alps with their forests, glaciers,  sunlight, waterfalls and chasms. There are people who do not like the  Alps. So much the worse for them.          CHAPTER XIV    PAULINE VIARDOT      Alfred de Musset covered Maria Malibran's tomb with immortal flowers and  he also told us the story of Pauline Garcia's debut. There is also  something about it in Theophile Gautier's writings. It is clear from  both accounts that her first appearance was an extraordinary occasion.  Natures such as hers reveal themselves at once to those who know and do  not have to wait to arrive until they are in full bloom. Pauline was  very young at the time, and soon afterwards she married M. Viardot,  manager of the Theatre-Italien and one of the finest men of his day. She  went abroad to develop her talent, but she returned in 1849 when  Meyerbeer named her to create the role of Fides in _Le Prophete_.    Her voice was tremendously powerful, prodigious in its range, and it  overcame all the difficulties in the art of singing. But this  marvellous voice did not please everyone, for it was by no means smooth  and velvety. Indeed, it was a little harsh and was likened to the taste  of a bitter orange. But it was just the voice for a tragedy or an epic,  for it was superhuman rather than human. Light things like Spanish songs  and Chopin mazurkas, which she used to transpose so that she could sing  them, were completely transformed by that voice and became the  playthings of an Amazon or of a giantess. She lent an incomparable  grandeur to tragic parts and to the severe dignity of the oratorio.    I never had the pleasure of hearing Madame Malibran, but Rossini told me  about her. He preferred her sister. Madame Malibran, he said, had the  advantage of beauty. In addition, she died young and left a memory of an  artist in full possession of all her powers. She was not the equal of  her sister as a musician and could not have survived the decline of her  voice as the latter did.    Madame Viardot was not beautiful, indeed, she was far from it. The  portrait by Ary Scheffer is the only one which shows this unequalled  woman truthfully and gives some idea of her strange and powerful  fascination. What made her even more captivating than her talent as a  singer was her personality--one of the most amazing I have ever known.  She spoke and wrote fluently Spanish, French, Italian, English and  German. She was in touch with all the current literature of these  countries and in correspondence with people all over Europe.    She did not remember when she learned music. In the Garcia family music  was in the air they breathed. So she protested against the tradition  which represented her father as a tyrant who whipped his daughters to  make them sing. I have no idea how she learned the secrets of  composition, but save for the management of the orchestra she knew them  well. She wrote numerous _lieder_ on Spanish and German texts and all of  these show a faultless diction. But contrary to the custom of most  composers who like nothing better than to show their compositions, she  concealed hers as though they were indiscretions. It was exceedingly  difficult to persuade her to let one hear them, although the least  were highly creditable. Once she sang a Spanish popular song, a wild  haunting thing, with which Rubinstein fell madly in love. It was several  years before she would admit that she wrote it herself.    [Illustration: Mme. Pauline Viardot]    She wrote brilliant operettas in collaboration with Tourguenief, but  they were never published and were performed only in private. One  anecdote will show her versatility as a composer. She was a friend of  Chopin and Liszt and her tastes were strongly futuristic. M. Viardot, on  the contrary, was a reactionary in music. He even found Beethoven too  advanced. One day they had a guest who was also a reactionary. Madame  Viardot sang to them a wonderful work with recitative, aria and final  allegro, which they praised to the skies. She had written it expressly  for the occasion. I have read this work and even the cleverest would  have been deceived.    But it must not be thought from this that her compositions were mere  imitations. On the contrary they were extremely original. The only  explanation why those that were published have remained unknown and why  so many were unpublished is that this admirable artist had a horror of  publicity. She spent half her life in teaching pupils and the world knew  nothing about it.    During the Empire the Viardots used to give in their apartment on  Thursday evenings really fine musical festivals which my surviving  contemporaries still remember. From the salon in which the famous  portrait by Ary Scheffer was hung and which was devoted to ordinary  instrumental and vocal music, we went down a short staircase to a  gallery filled with valuable paintings, and finally to an exquisite  organ, one of Cavaille-Coll's masterpieces. In this temple dedicated to  music we listened to arias from the oratorios of Handel and Mendelssohn.  She had sung them in London, but could not get a hearing for them in the  concerts in Paris as they were averse to such vast compositions. I had  the honor to be her regular accompanist both at the organ and the piano.    But this passionate lover of song was an all-round musician. She played  the piano admirably, and when she was among friends she overcame the  greatest difficulties. Before her Thursday audiences, however, she  limited herself to chamber music, with a special preference for Henri  Reber's duets for the piano and the violin. These delicate, artistic  works are unknown to the amateurs of to-day. They seem to prefer to the  pure juice of the grape in crystal glasses poisonous potions in cups of  gold. They must have orgies, sumptuous ceilings, a deadly luxury. They  do not understand the poet who sings, _\"O rus, quando te aspiciam!\"_  They do not appreciate the great distinction of simplicity. Reber's muse  is not for them.    Madame Viardot was as learned a musician as any one could be and she was  among the first subscribers to the complete edition of Sebastian Bach's  works. We know what an astounding revelation that work was. Each year  brought ten religious cantatas, and each year brought us new surprises  in the unexpected variety and impressiveness of the work. We thought we  had known Sebastian Bach, but now we learned how really to know him. We  found him a writer of unusual versatility and a great poet. His  _Wohltemperirte Klavier_ had given us only a hint of all this. The  beauties of this famous work needed exposition for, in the absence of  definite instructions, opinions differed. In the cantatas the meaning of  the words serves as an indication and through the analogy between the  forms of expression, it is easy to see pretty clearly what the author  intended in his _Klavier_ pieces.    One fine day the annual volume was found to contain a cantata in several  parts written for a contralto solo accompanied by stringed instruments,  oboes and an organ obligato. The organ was there and the organist as  well. So we assembled the instruments, Stockhausen, the baritone, was  made the leader of the little orchestra, and Madame Viardot sang the  cantata. I suspect that the author had never heard his work sung in any  such manner. I cherish the memory of that day as one of the most  precious in my musical career. My mother and M. Viardot were the only  listeners to this exceptional exhibition. We did not dare to repeat it  before hearers who were not ready for it. What would now be a great  success would have fallen flat at that time. And nothing is more  irritating than to see an audience cold before a beautiful work. It is  far better to keep to one's self treasures which will be unappreciated.    One thing will always stand in the way of the vogue of Sebastian Bach's  vocal works--the difficulty of translation. When they are rendered into  French, they lose all their charm and oftentimes become ridiculous.           *       *       *       *       *    One of the most amazing characteristics of Madame Viardot's talent was  her astonishing facility in assimilating all styles of music. She was  trained in the old Italian music and she revealed its beauties as no one  else has ever done. As for myself, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16462"],[0,"With the Boer Forces (#16)"],[1,"slain. Large bodies of Boers rarely  attacked, and never resisted the enemy on level stretches of veld, not  because they lacked courage to do so, but because they saw the futility of  such action. After the British drove the Boers out of the kopjes east and  north-east of Bloemfontein the burghers had no broken country suited to  their particular style of warfare, and they retreated to the Vaal without  much effort to stop the advance of the enemy. The Boer generals knew that  the British were equipped with innumerable cannon, which could sweep the  level veld for several miles before them and make the ground untenable for  the riflemen--the mainstay of the Boer army.    [Illustration: SPION KOP, WHERE BOERS CHARGED UP THE HILLSIDE]    When they were on hills the Boers were able to entrench themselves so  thoroughly that the fire of several hundred heavy guns made hardly any  impression on them, but as soon as they attempted to apply those tactics  on level ground the results were most disastrous. At Colenso and  Magersfontein the burghers remained in their trenches on the hills while  thousands of shrapnel and other shells exploded above and around them, but  very few men were injured, and when the British infantry advanced under  cover of the shell fire the Boers merely remained in the trenches until  the enemy had approached to within several hundred yards and then assailed  them with rifle fire. Trenches always afforded perfect safety from shell  fire, and on that account the Boers were able to cope so long and well  with the British in the fighting along the Tugela and around Kimberley.  The Boers generally remained quietly in their trenches and made no reply  to the British cannon fire, however hot it was. The British generals  several times mistook this silence as an indication that the Boers had  evacuated the trenches, and sent forward bodies of infantry to occupy the  positions. When the infantry reached the Boer zone of fire they usually  met with a terrific Mauser fire that could not be stemmed, however gallant  the attacks might have been. Hundreds of British soldiers lost their lives  while going forward under shell fire to occupy a position which, it was  presumed by the generals, was unoccupied by the Boers.    There were innumerable instances, also, of extraordinarily brave acts by  individual burghers, but it was extremely difficult to hear of them owing  to the Boers' disinclination to discuss a battle in its details. No Boer  ever referred to his exploits or those of his friends of his own volition,  and then only in the most indefinite manner. He related the story of a  battle in much the same manner he told of the tilling of his fields or the  herding of his cattle, and when there was any part of it pertaining to his  own actions he passed it over without comment. It seemed as if every one  was fighting, not for his own glorification, but for the success of his  country's army, and consequently there was little hero-worship. Individual  acts of bravery entitled the fortunate person to have his name mentioned  in the _Staats-Courant_, the Government gazette, but hardly any attention  was paid to the search for heroes, and only the names of a few men were  even chronicled in the columns of that periodical. One of the bravest men  in the Natal campaign was a young Pretoria burgher named Van Gas, who, in  his youth, had an accident which made it necessary that his right arm  should be amputated at the elbow. Later in life he was injured in one of  the native wars and the upper arm was amputated, so that when he joined a  commando he had only the left arm. It was an extraordinary spectacle to  observe young Van Gaz holding his carbine between his knees while loading  it with cartridges, and quite as strange to see the energy with which he  discharged his rifle with one hand. He was in the van of the storming  party at Spion Kop, where a bullet passed completely through his chest. He  continued, however, to work his rifle between his knees and to shoot with  his left arm, and was one of the first men to reach the summit of the  hill, where he snatched the rifles from the hands of two British  soldiers. After the battle was won he was carried to a hospital by several  other burghers, but a month afterwards he was again at the front at the  Tugela, going into exposed positions and shouting, \"Come on, fellows, here  is a good chance!\" His companions desired to elect him as their  field-cornet, but he refused the honour.    Evert Le Roux and Herculaas Nel, of the Swaziland Police, and two of the  best scouts in the Boer army, were constantly engaged in recklessly daring  enterprises, none of which, however, was quite equal to their actions on  April 21st, when the vicinity of Ladysmith had been in British hands for  almost two months. The two men went out on patrol and by night crept up a  kopje behind which about three hundred British cavalrymen were  bivouacking. The men were twenty miles distant from their laagers at  Dundee and only a short distance from Ladysmith, but they lay down and  slept on the other side of the kopje, less than a hundred yards from the  cavalrymen. In the morning the British cavalry was divided into three  squads, and all started for Ladysmith. Le Roux and Nel swept down toward  the last squad, and called, \"Hands up,\" to one of the men in the van. The  cavalryman promptly held up his hands and a minute afterward surrendered  his gun and himself, while the remainder of the squad fled precipitately.  The two scouts, with their prisoner, quickly made a _detour_ of another  kopje, and appeared in front of the first squad, of whom they made a  similar demand. One of the cavalrymen, who was in advance of the others,  surrendered without attempting to make any resistance, while the others  turned quickly to the right and rode headlong into a deep sluit. Le Roux  shot the horse of one of the men before he reached the sluit, loaded the  unhorsed man on one of the other prisoner's horses, and then pursued the  fleeing cavalrymen almost to the city-limits of Ladysmith.    Major Albrecht, the head of the Free State-Artillery, was one of the  bravest men in General Cronje's commando, and his display of courage at  the battle of Magersfontein was not less extraordinary than that which he  made later in the river bed at Paardeberg. At Magersfontein Albrecht and  two of his artillerymen operated the cannon which were located behind  schanzes twenty feet apart. The British had more than thirty cannon, which  they turned upon the Boer cannon whenever one of them was discharged.  After a short time the fire became so hot that Albrecht sent his  assistants to places of safety, and operated the guns alone. For eight  hours the intrepid Free State artilleryman jumped from one cannon to  another, returning the fire whenever there was a lull in the enemy's  attack and seeking safety behind the schanze when shells were falling too  rapidly. It was an uneven contest, but the bravery of the one man inspired  the others, and the end of the day saw the Boers nearer victory than they  were in the morning. At Tafelkop, on March 30th, three burghers were  caught napping by three British soldiers, who suddenly appeared before  them and shouted, \"Hands up!\" While the soldiers were advancing toward  them the three burghers succeeded in getting their rifles at their  captors' heads, and turned the tables by making prisoners of them. There  were many such instances of bravery, but one that is almost incredible  occurred at the place called Railway Hill, near the Tugela, on February  24th. On that day the Boers did not appear to know anything concerning the  position of the enemy, and James Marks, a Rustenburg farmer, determined to  go out of the laager and reconnoitre on his own responsibility. Marks was  more than sixty-two years old, and was somewhat decrepit, a circumstance  which did not prevent him from taking part in almost every one of the  Natal battles, however. The old farmer had been absent from his laager  less than an hour when he saw a small body of British soldiers at the foot  of a kopje. He crept cautiously around the kopje, and, when he was within  a hundred yards of the men, he shouted, \"Hands up!\" The soldiers  immediately lifted their arms, and, in obedience to the orders of Marks,  stacked their guns on a rock and advanced toward him. Marks placed the men  in a line, saw that there were twenty-three big, able-bodied soldiers, and  then marched them back into camp, to the great astonishment of his  generals and fellow burghers.    [Illustration: PLAN OF BATTLEFIELD OF SANNASPOST]          CHAPTER VI    THE BOERS IN BATTLE      The battle of Sannaspost on March 31st was one of the few engagements in  the campaign in which the forces of the Boers and the British were almost  numerically equal. There were two or three small battles in which the  Boers had more men engaged than the British, but in the majority of  instances the Boers were vastly outnumbered both in men and guns. At  Elandslaagte the Boers had exactly seven hundred and fifty burghers pitted  against the five or six thousand British; Spion Kop was won from three  thousand British by three hundred and fifty Boers; at the Tugela Botha  with not more than twenty-six hundred men fought for more than a week  against ten times that number of soldiers under General Buller; while the  greatest disparity between the opposing forces was at Paardeberg, where  Cronje spent a week in trying to lead his four thousand men through the  encircling wall of forty or fifty thousand British soldiers.    Sannaspost was not a decisive battle of the war, since no point of great  strategical importance was at stake, but it was more in the nature of a  demonstration of what the Boers were able to do when they were opposed to  a force of equal strength. It was a test which was equally fair to both  contestants, and neither of them could reasonably"]]]
