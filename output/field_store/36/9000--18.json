That pace  soon discouraged the others and left them jogging leisurely a mile  or two in the rear, and it also brought him the sooner to his  destination.    \"Wonder if she's mad yet,\" he asked himself, when he dismounted. No  one seemed to be about, but he reflected that it was just about noon  and they would probably be at dinner--and, besides, the weather was  not the sort to invite one outdoors unless driven by necessity.    The smell of roast meat, coffee and some sort of pie assailed his  nostrils pleasantly when he came to the house, and he went in eagerly  by the door which would bring him directly to the dining room. As he  had guessed, they were seated at the table. \"Why, come in, William,\"  Dill greeted, a welcoming note in his voice. \"We weren't looking for  you, but you are in good time. We've only just begun.\"    \"How do you do, Mr. Boyle?\" Miss Bridger added demurely.    \"Hello, Bill! How're yuh coming?\" cried another, and it was to him  that the eyes of Billy Boyle turned bewilderedly. That the Pilgrim  should be seated calmly at the Double-Crank table never once occurred  to him. In his thoughts of Miss Bridger he had mentally eliminated the  Pilgrim; for had she not been particular to show the Pilgrim that his  presence was extremely undesirable, that night at the dance?    \"Hello, folks!\" he answered them all quietly, because there was  nothing else that he could do until he had time to think. Miss Bridger  had risen and was smiling at him in friendly fashion, exactly as  if she had never run away from him and stayed away all the evening  because she was angry.    \"I'll fix you a place,\" she announced briskly. \"Of course you're  hungry. And if you want to wash off the dust of travel, there's plenty  of warm water out here in the kitchen. I'll get you some.\"    She may not have meant that for an invitation, but Billy followed her  into the kitchen and calmly shut the door behind him. She dipped warm  water out of the reservoir for him and hung a fresh towel on the  nail above the washstand in the corner, and seemed about to leave him  again.    \"Yuh mad yet?\" asked Billy, because he wanted to keep her there.    \"Mad? Why?\" She opened her eyes at him. \"Not as much as you look,\" she  retorted then. \"You look as cross as if--\"    \"What's the Pilgrim doing here?\" Billy demanded suddenly and  untactfully.    \"Who? Mr. Walland?\" She went into the pantry and came back with a  plate for him. \"Why, nothing; he's just visiting. It's Sunday, you  know.\"    \"Oh--is it?\" Billy bent over the basin, hiding his face from her. \"I  didn't know; I'd kinda lost count uh the days.\" Whereupon he made  a great splashing in his corner and let her go without more  words, feeling more than ever that he needed time to think. \"Just  visiting--'cause it's _Sunday_, eh? The dickens it is!\" Meditating  deeply, he was very deliberate in combing his hair and settling his  blue tie and shaking the dust out of his white silk neckerchief  and retying it in a loose knot; so deliberate that Mama Joy was  constrained to call out to him: \"Your dinner is getting cold, Mr.  Boyle,\" before he went in and took his seat where Miss Bridger had  placed him--and he doubted much her innocence in the matter--elbow to  elbow with the Pilgrim.    \"How's shipping coming on, Billy?\" inquired the Pilgrim easily,  passing to him the platter of roast beef. \"Most through, ain't yuh?\"    \"The outfit's on the way in,\" answered Billy, accepting noncommittally  the meat and the overture for peace. \"They'll be here in less than an  hour.\"    If the Pilgrim wanted peace, he was thinking rapidly, what grounds had  he for ignoring the truce? He himself had been the aggressor and he  also had been the victor. According to the honor of fighting men, he  should be generous. And when all was said and done--and the thought  galled Billy more than he could understand--the offense of the Pilgrim  had been extremely intangible; it had consisted almost wholly of looks  and a tone or two, and he realized quite plainly that his own dislike  of the Pilgrim had probably colored his judgment. Anyway, he had  thrashed the Pilgrim and driven him away from camp and killed his dog.  Wasn't that enough? And if the Pilgrim chose to forget the unpleasant  circumstances of their parting and be friends, what could he do but  forget also? Especially since the girl did not appear to be holding  any grudge for what had passed between them in the line-camp. Billy,  buttering a biscuit with much care, wished he knew just what _had_  happened that night before he opened the door, and wondered if he  dared ask her.    Under all his thoughts and through all he hated the Pilgrim, his bold  blue eyes, his full, smiling lips and smooth cheeks, as he had never  hated him before; and he hated himself because, being unable to  account even to himself for his feelings toward the Pilgrim, he was  obliged to hide his hate and be friends--or else act the fool. And  above all the mental turmoil he was somehow talking and listening and  laughing now and then, as if there were two of him and each one was  occupied with his own affairs. \"I wisht to thunder there was _three_  uh me,\" he thought fleetingly during a pause. \"I'd set the third one  uh me to figuring out just where the girl stands in this game, and  what she's thinking about right now. There's a kinda twinkling in her  eyes, now and then when she looks over here, that sure don't line up  with her innocent talk. I wisht I could mind-read her--    \"Yes, we didn't get through none too soon. Looks a lot like we're  going to get our first slice uh winter. We've been playing big luck  that we didn't get it before now; and that last bunch uh beef was  sure rollicky and hard to handle--we'd uh had a picnic with all the  trimmings if a blizzard had caught us with them on our hands. As it  is, we're all dead on our feet. I expect to sleep about four days  without stopping for meals, if you ask _me_.\"    One cannot wonder that Charming Billy heard thankfully the clatter of  his outfit arriving, or that he left half his piece of pie uneaten  and hurried off, on the plea that he must show them what to do--which  would have caused a snicker among the men if they had overheard him.  He did not mind Dill following him out, nor did he greatly mind the  Pilgrim remaining in the house with Miss Bridger. The relief of being  even temporarily free from the perplexities of the situation mastered  all else and sent him whistling down the path to the stables.          CHAPTER XIV.    _A Winter at the Double-Crank_.      There are times when, although the months as they pass seem full,  nothing that has occurred serves to mark a step forward or back in the  destiny of man. After a year, those months of petty detail might be  wiped out entirely without changing the general trend of events--and  such a time was the winter that saw \"Dill and Bill,\" as one  alliterative mind called them, in possession of the Double-Crank. The  affairs of the ranch moved smoothly along toward a more systematic  running than had been employed under Brown's ownership. Dill settled  more and more into the new life, so that he was so longer looked upon  as a foreign element; he could discuss practical ranch business and be  sure of his ground--and it was then that Billy realized more fully how  shrewd a brain lay behind those mild, melancholy blue eyes, and how  much a part of the man was that integrity which could not stoop to  small meanness or deceit. It would have been satisfying merely to know  that such a man lived, and if Billy had needed any one to point  the way to square living he must certainly have been better for the  companionship of Dill.    As to Miss Bridger, he stood upon much the same footing with her as he  had in the fall, except that he called her Flora, in the familiarity  which comes of daily association; to his secret discomfort she had  fulfilled her own prophecy and called him Billy Boy. Though he liked  the familiarity, he emphatically did not like the mental attitude  which permitted her to fall so easily into the habit of calling him  that. Also, he was in two minds about the way she would come to the  door of the living room and say: \"Come, Billy Boy, and dry the dishes  for me--that's a good kid!\"    Billy had no objections to drying the dishes; of a truth, although  that had been a duty which he shirked systematically in line-camps  until everything in the cabin was in that state which compels action,  he would have been willing to stand beside Flora Bridger at the sink  and wipe dishes (and watch her bare, white arms, with the dimply  elbows) from dark until dawn. What he did object to was the  half-patronizing, wholly matter-of-fact tone of her, which seemed to  preclude any possibility of sentiment so far as she was concerned.  She always looked at him so frankly, with never a tinge of red in her  cheeks to betray that consciousness of sex which goes ever--say what  you like--with the love of a man and a maid.    He did not want her to call him \"Billy Boy\" in just that tone; it made  him feel small and ineffective and young--he who was eight or nine  years older than she! It put him down, so that he could not bring  himself to making actual love to her--and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#16)"],[1,"flying powder; the  leaden clouds, rolling close to the tree-tops, grew brighter and  brighter; bits of azure sky shone through rifts.    Navvy had tramped off to find the horses, and not long after his  departure he sent out a prolonged yell that echoed through the forest.    \"Something's up,\" said Emett instantly. \"An Indian never yells like  that at a horse.\"    [Illustration: A LION TIED]    [Illustration: FIGHTING WEETAHS (BUFFALO BULLS) ON BUFFALO JONES'S  DESERT RANCH]    We waited quietly for a moment, expecting to hear the yell repeated.  It was not, though we soon heard the jangle of bells, which told us he  had the horses coming. He appeared off to the right, riding Foxie and  racing the others toward camp.    \"Cougie--mucha big--dam!\" he said leaping off the mustang to confront  us.    \"Emett, does he mean he saw a cougar or a track?\" questioned Jones.    \"Me savvy,\" replied the Indian. \"_Butteen, butteen_!\"    \"He says, trail--trail,\" put in Emett. \"I guess I'd better go and  see.\"    \"I'll go with you,\" said Jones. \"Jim, keep the hounds tight and hurry  with the horses' oats.\"    We followed the tracks of the horses which lead southwest toward the  rim, and a quarter of a mile from camp we crossed a lion trail running  at right angles with our direction.    \"Old Sultan!\" I cried, breathlessly, recognizing that the tracks had  been made by a giant lion we had named Sultan. They were huge, round,  and deep, and with my spread hand I could not reach across one of  them.    Without a word, Jones strode off on the trail. It headed east and  after a short distance turned toward camp. I suppose Jones knew what  the lion had been about, but to Emett and me it was mystifying. Two  hundred yards from camp we came to a fallen pine, the body of which  was easily six feet high. On the side of this log, almost on top, were  two enormous lion tracks, imprinted in the mantle of snow. From here  the trail led off northeast.    \"Darn me!\" ejaculated Jones. \"The big critter came right into camp; he  scented our lions, and raised up on this log to look over.\"    Wheeling, he started for camp on the trot. Emett and I kept even  with him. Words were superfluous. We knew what was coming. A  made--to--order lion trail could not have equalled the one right in  the back yard of our camp.    \"Saddle up!\" said Jones, with the sharp inflection of words that had  come to thrill me. \"Jim, Old Sultan has taken a look at us since break  of day.\"    I got into my chaps, rammed my little automatic into its saddle  holster and mounted. Foxie seemed to want to go. The hounds came out  of their sheds and yawned, looking at us knowingly. Emett spoke a word  to the Navajo, and then we were trotting down through the forest. The  sun had broken out warm, causing water to drip off the snow laden  pines. The three of us rode close behind Jones, who spoke low and  sternly to the hounds.    What an opportunity to watch Don! I wondered how soon he would catch  the scent of the trail. He led the pack as usual and kept to a  leisurely dog--trot. When within twenty yards of the fallen log, he  stopped for an instant and held up his head, though without exhibiting  any suspicion or uneasiness.    The wind blew strong at our backs, a circumstance that probably  kept Don so long in ignorance of the trail. A few yards further on,  however, he stopped and raised his fine head. He lowered it and  trotted on only to stop again. His easy air of satisfaction with  the morning suddenly vanished. His savage hunting instinct awakened  through some channel to raise the short yellow hair on his neck and  shoulders and make it stand stiff. He stood undecided with warily  shifting nose, then jumped forward with a yelp. Another jump brought  another sharp cry from him. Sounder, close behind, echoed the yelp.  Jude began to whine. Then Don, with a wild howl, leaped ten feet to  alight on the lion trail and to break into wonderfully rapid flight.  The seven other hounds, bunched in a black and yellow group, tore  after him filling the forest with their wild uproar.    Emett's horse bounded as I have seen a great racer leave the post, and  his desert brothers, loving wild bursts of speed, needing no spur,  kept their noses even with his flanks. The soft snow, not too deep,  rather facilitated than impeded this wild movement, and the open  forest was like a highway.    So we rode, bending low in the saddle, keen eyes alert for branches,  vaulting the white--blanketed logs, and swerving as we split to pass  the pines. The mist from the melting snow moistened our faces, and the  rushing air cooled them with fresh, soft sensation. There were moments  when we rode abreast and others when we sailed single file, with white  ground receding, vanishing behind us.    My feeling was one of glorious excitation in the swift, smooth flight  and a grim assurance of soon seeing the old lion. But I hoped we would  not rout him too soon from under a windfall, or a thicket where he  had dragged a deer, because the race was too splendid a thing to cut  short. Through my mind whirled with inconceivable rapidity the great  lion chases on which we had ridden the year before. And this was  another chase, only more stirring, more beautiful, because it was the  nature of the thing to grow always with experience.    Don slipped out of sight among the pines. The others strung along the  trail, glinted across the sunlit patches. The black pup was neck and  neck with Ranger. Sounder ran at their heels, leading the other pups.  Moze dashed on doggedly ahead of Jude.    But for us to keep to the open forest, close to the hounds, was not in  the nature of a lion chase. Old Sultan's trail turned due west when he  began to go down the little hollows and their intervening ridges. We  lost ground. The pack left us behind. The slope of the plateau became  decided. We rode out of the pines to find the snow failing in the  open. Water ran in little gullies and glistened on the sagebrush. A  half mile further down the snow had gone. We came upon the hounds  running at fault, except Sounder, and he had given up.    \"All over,\" sang out Jones, turning his horse. \"The lion's track and  his scent have gone with the snow. I reckon we'll do as well to wait  until to-morrow. He's down in the middle wing somewhere and it is my  idea we might catch his trail as he comes back.\"    The sudden dashing aside of our hopes was exasperating. There seemed  no help for it; abrupt ending to exciting chases were but features of  the lion hunt. The warm sun had been hours on the lower end of the  plateau, where the snow never lay long; and even if we found a fresh  morning trail in the sand, the heat would have burned out the scent.    So rapidly did the snow thaw that by the time we reached camp only the  shady patches were left.    It was almost eleven o'clock when I lay down on my bed to rest awhile  and fell asleep. The tramp of a horse awakened me. I heard Jim calling  Jones. Thinking it was time to eat I went out. The snow had all  disappeared and the forest was brown as ever. Jim sat on his horse and  Navvy appeared riding up to the hollow, leading the saddle horses.    \"Jones, get out,\" called Jim.    \"Can't you let a fellow sleep? I'm not hungry,\" replied Jones testily.    \"Get out and saddle up,\" continued Jim.    Jones burst out of his tent, with rumpled hair and sleepy eyes.    \"I went over to see the carcass of the deer an' found a lion sittin'  up in the tree, feedin' for all he was worth. Pie jumped out an' ran  up the hollow an' over the rim. So I rustled back for you fellows.  Lively now, we'll get this one sure.\"    \"Was it the big fellow?\" I asked    \"No, but he ain't no kitten; an' he's a fine color, sort of reddish. I  never seen one just as bright. Where's Emett?\"    \"I don't know. He was here a little while ago. Shall I signal for  him?\"    \"Don't yell,\" cried Jones holding up his fingers. \"Be quiet now.\"    Without another word we finished saddling, mounted and, close  together, with the hounds in front, rode through the forest toward the  rim.      V    We rode in different directions toward the hollow, the better to  chance meeting with Emett, but none of us caught a glimpse of him.    It happened that when we headed into the hollow it was at a point just  above where the deer carcass hung in the scrub oak. Don in spite of  Jones' stern yells, let out his eager hunting yelp and darted down the  slope. The pack bolted after him and in less than ten seconds were  racing up the hollow, their thrilling, blending bays a welcome spur to  action. Though I spoke not a word to my mustang nor had time to raise  the bridle, he wheeled to one side and began to run. The other horses  also kept to the ridge, as I could tell by the pounding of hoofs on  the soft turf. The hounds in full cry right under us urged our good  steeds to a terrific pace. It was well that the ridge afforded clear  going.    The speed at which we traveled, however, fast as it was, availed not  to keep up with the pack. In a short half mile, just as the hollow  sloped and merged into level ground, they left us behind and  disappeared so quickly as almost to frighten me. My mustang plunged  out of the forest to the rim and dashed along, apparently unmindful of  the chasm. The red and yellow surface blurred in a blinding glare. I  heard the chorus of hounds, but as its direction baffled me I trusted  to my horse and I did well, for soon he came to a dead halt on the  rim.    Then I heard the hounds below me. I had but time to see the character  of the place--long, yellow promontories running out and slopes of  weathered stone reaching up between to a level with the rim--when in a  dwarf pine growing just over the edge I caught sight of a long, red,  pantherish body.    I whooped to my followers now close upon me and leaping off hauled out  my Remington and ran to the cliff. The lion's long, slender body, of a  rare golden-red color,"]]]
