[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13325"],[0,"Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon (#16)"],[1,"de Jesus_, quoted in the _Asiat.  Journ._ vol. xiv. p. 461; and in FORBES' _Orient. Memoirs_, vol. i. p.  421.]    The Dutch were no less inclined to the marvellous, and they propagated  the belief in the mermaid with earnestness and particularity. VALENTYN,  one of their chaplains, in his account of the Natural History of  Amboina, embodied in his great work on the Netherlands' Possessions in  India, published so late as 1727[1], has devoted the first section of  his chapter on the Fishes of that island to a minute description of the  \"Zee-Menschen, Zee-Wyven,\" and mermaids. As to the dugong he admits its  resemblance to the mermaid, but repudiates the idea of its having given  rise to the fable, by being mistaken for one. This error he imagines  must have arisen at a time when observations on such matters were made  with culpable laxity; but now more recent and minute attention has  established the truth beyond cavil.    [Footnote 1: FRAN. VALENTYN, _Beschryving van Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien_,  &c. 5 vol. fol. Dordrecht and Amsterdam, MDCCXXVII. vol. iii. p. 330.]    For instance, he states that in 1653, when a lieutenant in the Dutch  service was leading a party of soldiers along the sea-shore in Amboina,  he and all his company saw the mermen swimming at a short distance from  the beach with long and flowing hair, of a colour between gray and  green--and six weeks afterwards, the creatures were again seen by him  and more than fifty witnesses, at the same place, by clear daylight.[1]    [Footnote 1: VALENTYN, _Beschryving, &c._, vol. iii. p. 331.]    \"If any narrative in the world,\" adds VALENTYN, \"deserves credit, it is  this; since _not only one but two mermen_ together were seen by so many  eye-witnesses. Should the stubborn world, however, hesitate to believe  it, it matters nothing; as there are people who would even deny that  such cities as Rome, Constantinople or Cairo, exist, merely because they  themselves have not happened to see them.\"    But what are such incredulous persons, he continues, to make of the  circumstance recorded by Albert Herport in his account of India[1], that  a sea-man was seen in the water near the Church of Taquan, on the  morning of the 29th of April 1661, and a mermaid at the same spot the  same afternoon?--or what do they say to the fact that in 1714, a mermaid  was not only seen but captured near the island of Booro? \"five feet  Rhineland measure in height, which lived four days and seven hours, but  refusing all food, died without leaving any intelligible account of  herself.\"    [Footnote 1: Probably the _Itinerarium Indicum_ of ALBRECHT HERPORT.  Berne, 1669.]    Valentyn, in support of his own faith in the mermaid, cites numerous  other instances in which both \"sea-men and women\" were seen and taken at  Amboina; especially one by an office-bearer in the Church of Holland[1],  by whom it was surrendered to the Governor Vanderstel.    [Footnote 1: A \"krank-bezoeker\" or visitant of the sick.]    Of this well-authenticated specimen he gives an elaborate engraving  amongst those of the authentic fishes of the island--together with a  minute ichthyological description of each for the satisfaction of men of  science.    [Illustration: THE MERMAID (From VALENTYN)]    The fame of this creature having reached Europe, the British Minister in  Holland wrote to Valentyn on the 28th December 1716, whilst the Emperor,  Peter the Great of Russia, was his guest at Amsterdam; to communicate  the desire of the Czar, that the mermaid should be brought home from  Amboina for his Imperial inspection.    To complete his proofs of the existence of mermen and women, Valentyn  points triumphantly to the historical fact, that in Holland in the year  1404, a mermaid was driven during a tempest, through a breach in the  dyke of Edam, and was taken alive in the lake of Purmer. Thence she was  carried to Harlem, where the Dutch women taught her to spin; and where,  several years after, she died in the Roman Catholic faith;--\"but this,\"  says the pious Calvinistic chaplain, \"in no way militates against the  truth of her story.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: VALENTYN, _Beschryving, &c_., p. 333.]    Finally Valentyn winds up his proofs, by the accumulated testimony of  Pliny [1], Theodore Gaza, George of Trebisond, and Alexander ab  Alexandro, to show that mermaids had in all ages been known in Gaul,  Naples, Epirus, and the Morea. From these and a multitude of more modern  instances he comes to the conclusion, that as there are \"sea-cows,\"  \"sea-horses,\" and \"sea-dogs;\" as well as \"sea-trees\" and \"sea-flowers\"  which he himself had seen, what grounds in reason are there to doubt  that there may also be \"sea-maidens\" and \"sea-men!\"    [Footnote 1: _Nat. Hist_. l. ix. c. 5, where Pliny speaks of the  Nereids.]    _List of Ceylon Mammalia._    A list of the Mammalia of Ceylon is subjoined. In framing it, as well as  the lists appended to the other chapters on the Fauna of the island, the  principal object in view has been to exhibit the extent to which the  Natural History of the island had been investigated, and collections  made up to the period of my leaving the colony in 1850. It has been  considered expedient to exclude a few individuals which have not had the  advantage of a direct comparison with authentic specimens, either at  Calcutta or in England. This will account for the omission of a number  that have appeared in other catalogues, but of which many, though  ascertained to exist, have not been submitted to this rigorous process  of identification.    The greater portion of the species of mammals and birds contained in  these lists will be found, with suitable references to the most accurate  descriptions, in the admirable catalogue of the collection at the India  House, published under the care of the late Dr. Horsfield. This work  cannot be too highly extolled, not alone for the scrupulous fidelity  with which the description of each species is referred to its first  discoverer, but also for the pains which have been taken to elaborate  synonymes and to collate from local periodicals and other sources,  (little accessible to ordinary inquirers,) such incidents and traits as  are calculated to illustrate characteristics and habits.

THE ELEPHANT.           *       *       *       *       *    _Structure and Functions._    During my residence at Kandy, I had twice the opportunity of witnessing  the operation on a grand scale, of capturing wild elephants, intended to  be trained for the public service in the establishment of the Civil  Engineer;--and in the course of my frequent journeys through the  interior of the island, I succeeded in collecting so many facts relative  to the habits of these interesting animals in a state of nature, as  enable me not only to add to the information previously possessed, but  to correct many fallacies popularly received regarding their instincts  and disposition. These particulars I am anxious to place on record  before proceeding to describe the scenes of which I was a spectator,  during the progress of the elephant hunts in the district of the Seven  Korles, at which I was present in 1846, and again in 1847.    With the exception of the narrow but densely inhabited belt of  cultivated land, that extends along the seaborde of the island from  Chilaw on the western coast to Tangalle on the south-east, there is no  part of Ceylon in which elephants may not be said to abound; even close  to the environs of the most populous localities of the interior. They  frequent both the open plains and the deep forests; and their footsteps  are to be seen wherever food and shade, vegetation and water[1], allure  them, alike on the summits of the loftiest mountains, and on the borders  of the tanks and lowland streams.    [Footnote 1: M. AD. PICTET has availed himself of the love of the  elephant for water, to found on it a solution of the long-contested  question as to the etymology of the word \"elephant,\"-a term which,  whilst it has passed into almost"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13331"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Chichester (1901) (#16)"],[1,"is  entirely gone, and the brilliant colouring that once covered the  entire monument is only to be traced in a few places. The outer robe  still shows some signs of the rich blue with which it used to be  covered. The face of the figure appears to be badly mutilated, but the  damage to the features has been done principally by an endeavour to  preserve them. A thick coat of plaster had been placed over the face  to protect it from injury, perhaps in the seventeenth century or  earlier, and this was never completely removed. It had become  gradually polished like the material of the figure itself, and so it  remains, with a cut across it to represent a mouth. The remains of the  real face are still hidden beneath.    [Illustration: THE SACRISTY (SEE P. 90). _S.B. Bolas & Co. photo_.]    Close to this effigy, but in the aisle farther to the east, and on the  north wall, are two admirable memorial tablets which were designed in  the eighteenth century. One is in memory of Dean Hayley and his wife  (6), and the other in memory of Henry Baker and his wife and their  only child (7), who, by comparison with the other tablet, appears to  have been a second wife of the same Thomas Hayley.    Close to the porch in the south aisle is the only complete old brass  in the building (8). It is dated 1592, and records the fact that \"Mr.  William Bradbridge\" was \"thrice Maior of this Cittie,\" and \"had vi  sonnes & viii daughters.\" The other monuments in the nave are those of  Matthew Quantock, Dean Cloos, Bishop Arundel, and William Huskisson,  sometime member of Parliament for Chichester. One on the south side of  the west porch is Bishop Stephen de Berghstead's, and the other  opposite on the north is a work of the fifteenth century.    The #Choir and Sanctuary#--These are very different in appearance now  from what they were, as will be seen by reference to the chapter on  the history of the fabric.    The #Reredos# was designed by Messrs. Slater & Carpenter, and has  never been completed. It is generally considered that it is not at all  in keeping with the character of the building, and there is some hope  that it may be one day removed. The subject of the figure-work in the  panel is \"The Ascension.\"    The #Altar# was presented by the late Mr. J.F. France, and is made  of oak. Some of the frontals are very elaborate examples of modern  embroidery.    The #Pavements# are composed of many specimens of various coloured  marbles.    The #Stalls# are those which have been in use since the fourteenth  century. All the furniture of the choir had been removed for safety  before the fall of the tower and spire: but the bishop's throne (9)  and the stalls for the dean and precentor have been added since that  time.    The #Candelabrum# which hangs from the vault was presented by Lady  Featherstonhaugh and two other ladies, in the eighteenth century.    The #Iron Grilles# which screen the eastern part of the choir from  the aisles are good examples of simple modern ironwork copied from old  examples; they were made in Chichester by Halsted & Sons.    [Illustration: THE MODERN ALTAR AND REREDOS.]    The #Organ# was placed on the north side of the choir after it  had been removed from its earlier position on the Arundel screen; and  in 1888, when it was largely remodelled, a new oak case was designed  for it. It was made originally by Harris in 1678, and had then only  one manual and no pedals; but between this date and the last  alteration, it had already been enlarged no less than at six different  times.    As the choir stalls are immediately under the crossing, above which  rises the new central tower and spire, they are a convenient place  from which to examine the work of restoration. The new work represents  as nearly as possible all that was there before the collapse of the  old piers and arches.    In the #South Transept# the most important feature is the  beautifully designed stonework of the tracery in the south window; but  this may be seen better from the cloisters, as the crude vulgarity of  the bad painted glass makes it difficult to examine it from within the  building.    The #Sacristy# (10), now used as a choir school and vestry, is a  large vaulted chamber, lighted on the south side by six small windows  (see page 87).    The #Chapel of S. Pantaleon# (11), on the east side of the  transept, still retains the old piscina in the south wall; but it is  used now as the vestry for the dean and canons.    The vaulting ribs in the part of the transept between this chapel and  the sacristy are carved like those in the last bay of the presbytery  next to the lady-chapel, and are of the same date. They appear to be  part of the work done during Bishop Gilbert Leophardo's episcopate.    The #Pictures# by Bernardi on the back of the choir stalls (see  illustration, p. 113) represent Ceadwalla and Henry VIII. granting and  confirming privileges to the bishops of their day. The portraits of  the bishops of the see from Wilfrid to Sherborne are in the north  transept.    The #South Aisle of the Choir# is entered from the south transept  under a deeply moulded arch. On the south is the priest-vicars' vestry  (12), and at the east end the #chapel of S. Mary Magdalen#. This  chapel was restored by Messrs. G.F. Bodley, A.R.A., and T. Garner,  architects, in memory of the Rev. T.F. Crosse, who was precentor and  canon of the cathedral. The aumbry in the north wall was the  receptacle in which S. Richard's head was preserved in a case of  silver. This is mentioned in William de Tenne's will. On the other  side is the old piscina. The paintings in the panels by Miss Lowndes  represent, on the north side (i) S. Richard celebrating the Eucharist  in S. Edmund's Chapel, (ii) the same bishop preaching, and (iii) his  death; on the south, (i) Mary anoints our Lord's Feet, (ii) The  Crucifixion, (iii) After the Resurrection. The carved and painted  reredos is of stone. Close to this chapel is the doorway into the  church from the east walk of the cloisters; in the spandrels of the  arches, both inside and outside, are the arms of William of Wykeham.  Above it is a window, the glass in which was given by Cardinal Manning  (when Archdeacon of Chichester) in memory of his wife.    [Illustration: THE TRIFORIUM IN THE CHOIR. _S.B. Bolas & Co., photo_.]    [Illustration. DECORATION ON THE VAULT OF THE LADY-CHAPEL, BY TH.  BERNARDI, 1519 (SEE P. 34). (Scale about 4 feet 10 ins. to 1 in).  _H.C. Corletle, delin_.]    The #Presbytery#, Ambulatory, or retro-choir, is the space between  the back of the reredos and the entrance to the lady-chapel. The  design in detail of these two bays is very different in character from  the three in the choir, which are like those in the nave. The two  piers of Purbeck marble are circular, and about them are grouped four  detached shafts of the same material. They are united only at the base  and by the abacus above the capitals, which are beautifully carved  (see page 16). The main arches in the two bays are not pointed, but  round, like those in the nave and choir; but, unlike the latter, they  have deeply cut mouldings in three orders. The triforium arcade above,  on the north and south sides, has moulded and carved details of a  similar character. Some of the beautifully carved figure-work still  remains in the spandrels between the subsidiary pointed arches. But  the most beautiful piece of design in all this work is in the arches  of the triforium passage across the east wall, above the entrance to  the lady-chapel.    [Illustration: THE PRESBYTERY OR RETRO-CHOIR, LOOKING NORTH-EAST.]    It should be noticed that the sub-arches in the triforium here are  pointed, not round, as in the case of those in the same position  westward of this portion. And the support to these arches in the  centre, is a group of shafts instead of only one column. The  clerestory, however, offers a greater contrast to the earlier work in  that the central arch, as well as the side ones, is lifted up much  higher, the detached columns being lengthened to obtain the  alteration. Each arch also, at this level, is now pointed.    S. Richard's shrine occupied the bay in the presbytery immediately  behind the High Altar. It stood upon a platform which was approached  on its eastern side by steps, and was enclosed by iron grilles. The  platform was removed at the time of the general restoration in  1861-1867, and upon it used to stand also the tombs of Bishop Day and  Bishop Christopherson or Curteys.    The #Lady-Chapel#, as its walls and vaulting clearly show, was once  completely decorated with designs in colour. The windows now are the  only parts that indicate an attempt to renew this portion of its  earlier condition. The new reredos is of alabaster, and was designed  by Messrs Carpenter & Ingelow.    The #North Choir Aisle# contains some monuments which are referred  to separately. The now unused chapel at its eastern end was dedicated  to S. Catharine.    The #Library# is approached through a doorway in this aisle. There  is a chamber above in which was the library of pre-Reformation days.  The present library formed the chapel of S. John the Baptist and S.  Edmund the King (13) until it became the chancel of the parish church  of S. Peter the Great, the north transept being used as its nave. Part  of the vaulting in it is unlike any other in the building, having the  chevron or zigzag ornament cut on the side of the mouldings of the  ribs (see page 98).    [Illustration: THE LADY-CHAPEL.]    The library collection contains many relics of various kinds: among  them are Oslac's grant of land to the church at Selsea, A.D. 780; a  manuscript of the twelfth century; Cranmer's copy of the \"Consultatio\"  of Herman of Cologne; an old Sarum missal; the sealed book of Charles  II.; fragments of ecclesiastical vessels; and a leaden \"Absolution\" of  Bishop Godfrey dating from the eleventh century.    The #North Transept# has on its west side "]]]
