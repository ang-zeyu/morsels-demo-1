FRIGGA.      I have made    A sacrifice unto the ancient gods,    Before the moon was gone.      BRUNHILDA.      The ancient gods!    The cross rules now, and Thor and Odin dwell    As devils in deep hell.      FRIGGA.      And dost thou fear    Them less for that? Their curses still may fall    Upon us, though their blessings are withheld,    And willingly I sacrificed the ram.    Oh, wouldst thou kill one too! Thy need is great    Above all others.      BRUNHILDA.      Mine?      FRIGGA.      Another time.    I long had meant to tell thee, and today    At last the hour has come.      BRUNHILDA.      I've always thought    That at thy death the hour would come to me,    So did not importune thee.      FRIGGA.      Mark me now!    From our volcano came there suddenly    An aged man and left with me a child,    A tablet, too, with runes.    [Illustration: Peter Cornelius Title Page of the Nibelungenlied]      BRUNHILDA.      'Twas in the night?      FRIGGA.      How dost thou know?      BRUNHILDA.      When on thee falls the moonlight--On    thy face, thou speakest oft aloud,    Betraying much.      FRIGGA.      And thou didst harken to me?    At midnight we were watching with our dead--Our    beauteous Queen. The old man's hair was white,    And longer than a woman's. Like a cloak    It hung about him, flowing softly down.      BRUNHILDA.      The spirit of the mountain!      FRIGGA.      Naught know I!--    No syllable he spoke. The little maid    Reached forth her hands and grasped the golden crown    That glittered brightly o'er the dead Queen's brow.    We marveled that it fitted her.      BRUNHILDA.      The child?      FRIGGA.      The little maid; and it was none too large,    Nor later did it bind her.      BRUNHILDA.      'Twas like mine!      FRIGGA.      Like thine it was! And, yet more wonderful.    The child was like the maid that lay there dead    Within the mother's arms and disappeared    As had it ne'er existed--yes, so like    That only by the breathing could we know    The living from the dead. It seemed to us    That nature must have formed one body twice,    With life for one child only.      BRUNHILDA.      Had the Queen    A new-born baby in her arms?      FRIGGA.      Her life    She gave to bear her child, and with her died    The little maid.      BRUNHILDA.      Thou didst not tell me that.    FRIGGA. I never thought to tell thee. Sorrow broke    The mother's heart that she could never show    Her baby to her lord. For many years    This priceless joy in vain he had desired,    And, just a month before the child was born,    A sudden death o'ertook him.      BRUNHILDA.      Tell me more!      FRIGGA.      We sought the aged man, but he was gone.    The glowing mountain that had been cleft through    As one might split an apple, slowly now    Was drawn together there before our eyes.      BRUNHILDA.      The old man came no more?      FRIGGA.      Now hark to me!    Next morning to the grave we bore our Queen;    But when the priest was ready to baptize    The little maid, his arm fell helpless down,    Nor could he touch her forehead with the dew    Of holy water, and his good right arm    He never lifted more.      BRUNHILDA.      What, never more!      FRIGGA.      The man was old, and so we marveled not.    We called another priest. The holy dew    He sprinkled on the child. The blessed words    Of benediction halted on his tongue,    Nor hath his speech returned.      BRUNHILDA.      And now the third?      FRIGGA.      For him we waited long. We had to seek    In other lands afar, where of the tale    None knew. At last this priest baptized the child.    His holy office ended, down he fell    Upon the ground and nevermore arose!      BRUNHILDA.      And did the baby live      FRIGGA.      She throve apace,    And strong she grew. Her playful ways to us    Were signs what we should do or leave undone.    They ne'er deceived us, for the runes had said    That we might trust them ever.      BRUNHILDA.      Frigga! Frigga!      FRIGGA.      Thou art indeed the maid! Now dost thou know    Not in the gloomy caverns of the dead,    In Hecla where the ancient gods still dwell,    Among the Norns, among the Valkyries,    Seek thou the mother that gave birth to thee!    Oh, that no drop of holy water e'er    Had touched thy brow! Then were we wiser far.      BRUNHILDA.      What dost thou murmur?      FRIGGA.      How then did it hap    That on this morning we were not in bed,    But fully robed had tarried in the hall?    Our teeth were chattering and our lips were blue.      BRUNHILDA.      A sudden sleep o'erwhelmed us, that was all.      FRIGGA.      But had it ever happened?      BRUNHILDA.      Not before.      FRIGGA.      Then hark! The old man came and tried to speak.    It almost seems as if I'd seen him stand    And grasp thy shoulder; and he threatened me,    But heavy was thy sleep. Thou should'st not hear    What fate awaits thee if thou dost persist.    So offer sacrifice and then be free.    Oh, had I paid no heed unto the priest,    Howe'er he urged me! But the sacred runes    I had not read aright.--Come, sacrifice,    For danger cometh nigh.      BRUNHILDA.      'Tis nigh?      FRIGGA.      Alas!    Thou knowest that the fiery sea is quenched    That flamed around thy castle.    BRUNHILDA. Yet the knight    Still lingers who should wield the magic sword    And on his war-horse gallop through the flames,    When he had won proud Fafner's ill-starred hoard.      FRIGGA.      I may have erred. But yet this second sign    Cannot deceive me, for I long have known    That when the fateful hour shall come to thee,    Clear vision doth await thee. Sacrifice!    Mayhap the ancient gods surround thee now    Invisibly, and they will straight appear    With the first blood-drops of thine offering.      BRUNHILDA.      I do not fear.      [_Trumpets are heard._]      FRIGGA.      The trumpets!      BRUNHILDA.      Hast thou ne'er    Heard them before.      FRIGGA.      Never before with dread.    The time for lopping thistle-heads is past,    And iron helms arise before thee now.      BRUNHILDA.      Come hither all! For I will let her see    Brunhilda still can conquer! While the sea    Of fire still flamed I hastened forth to meet ye,    And friendly, as a trusty dog will spring    To give his master room, my faithful fire    Drew back before me, sank on either hand;    The road stands open now, but not my heart.    [_She ascends her throne._]    Now fling the portals wide and let them in!    Whoever here may come, his head is mine!          SCENE II      _The gates are opened. Enter SIEGFRIED, GUNTHER, HAGEN and VOLKER_      BRUNHILDA.      Who cometh seeking death?      (_To SIEGFRIED._)      Ah! Is it thou?      SIEGFRIED.      I am not seeking death, nor will I sue.    And too much honor dost thou yield to me    In greeting Gunther's guide before himself,    For I am but his helper.      BRUNHILDA (_turning to GUNTHER_).      Then 'tis thou?    And know'st thou what is toward?      GUNTHER.      Full well I know!      SIEGFRIED.      The rumor of thy beauty spreads abroad,    But further still the fame of thy hard heart.    And who hath gazed but once in thy deep eyes    Will nevermore forget, e'en in his cups,    That dreadful death beside thee always stands.      BRUNHILDA.      Tis true! Who cannot conquer, he must die,    And all his servants with him. Smilest thou?    Be not so proud! For if thou cam'st to me    As thou could'st hold a beaker full of wine    On high above thy head and still could'st gaze    On me as on a picture, yet I swear    That thou shalt fall as any other falls.      (_TO GUNTHER._)      But thee I counsel, if thine ears can hear,    List to my maidens! Bid them tell the tale    Of heroes that my hand hath laid full low!    The chance may hap among them there is one    Hath tried his strength with thee. There may be one    Hath laid thee conquered at his very feet!      HAGEN.      Ne'er was King Gunther conquered.

The wood named bimbel by the natives grows with a shining  green lance-shaped leaf, and is in much request with them for the purpose  of making their spears, boomerangs, waddies, etc.)    (**Footnote.

A NEW GUIDE.    On reaching the camp I found that Piper had fallen in with some natives,  one of whom, an old man, undertook to conduct us to the Murrumbidgee in  five days, assuring us that the Lachlan entered that river. This  information, the dry state of the country, and the knowledge I had  acquired of its principal features, determined me to follow the course of  the Lachlan; and in the event of its soon uniting with the Murrumbidgee,  to continue along the right bank of that river to its junction with the  Murray, then to leave the bulk of our equipment, the carts and most of  the cattle, and complete the survey of the Darling with a lighter party.    April 29.    We moved down the Lachlan, travelling in my former track, and we pitched  our tents near the place where I had slept on the 26th, the cattle not  being able to go further, from the softness of the ground after the rain.    April 30.    Following the same track, the party reached, at the distance of twelve  miles, an angle of the river named Curwaddilly, at which there was a good  pond, and here we encamped. From this point I obtained a bearing on  Burradorgang, and it was the lowest station on the river which could be  connected with my survey of the hills for, when Burradorgang sunk below  the eastern horizon, a perfectly level line bounded our view on all  sides.    NATIVE DOG.    May 1.    Just as the party was leaving the ground a noise was heard in the rear,  and two shots were fired before I could hasten to the spot. These I found  had been inconsiderately fired by Jones our shepherd at a native dog  belonging to our new guide and which had attacked the sheep. This  circumstance was rather unfortunate, for our guide soon after fell  behind, alleging to the party that he was ill. I knew however where to  find water that day; and we proceeded to the fine pond which I was so  fortunate as to discover on the 24th ultimo after our horses had suffered  thirst for three days and two nights. Two young natives who had  accompanied us for some days undertook to find water for a couple of  journeys beyond this pond. The men caught in this friendly pool several  good cod-perch (Gristes peelii) a fish surpassing, in my opinion, all  others in Australia. As we crossed the plains this day I observed the  natives eating a plant which grew in the hollows and we found it, when  boiled, a very good vegetable.    BRANCHES OF THE LACHLAN.    May 2.    We pursued a course nearly west for seven miles, having the Lachlan on  our left until we were stopped by a watercourse, or branch of the river,  which crossed our intended route at rightangles. Its banks were steep and  the passage of our waggons was consequently a work of difficulty, but the  best crossing place appeared to be just where it left the main channel.  Here accordingly we cut down the bank on each side with spades and filled  up the soft lowest part of the hollow with stumps and branches of trees,  and all of which being covered with earth from the sides, the carts were  got safely across after about half an hour's work. We soon however came  to another similar watercourse, but by the advice of the natives we  followed it to the northward, and we found that at a short distance it  branched into shallow hollows of polygonum which we traversed without  delay or difficulty. Soon after we had resumed our course by crossing  these hollows, we came upon the main channel which very much resembled  other parts of the Lachlan, only that it was smaller.    A NATIVE CAMP.    Piper's gin came to tell us that there was water ahead, and that natives  were there. We accordingly approached with caution and having found two  ponds of water we encamped beside them, the local name of the situation  being Combedyega.    CHILDREN.    A fire was burning near the water and at it sat a black child about seven  or eight years old, quite blind. All the other natives had fled save one  poor little girl still younger who, notwithstanding the appearance of  such strange beings as we must have seemed to her, and the terror of  those who fled, nevertheless lingered about the bushes and at length took  her seat beside the blind boy. A large supply of the balyan root lay near  them, and a dog so lean as scarcely to be able to stand, drew his feeble  body close up beside the two children as if desirous to defend them. They  formed indeed a miserable group, exhibiting nevertheless instances of  affection and fidelity creditable both to the human and canine species.  An old man came up to the fire afterwards with other children. He told us  the name of the waterholes between that place and the Murrumbidgee, but  he could not be prevailed on to be our guide.    A WIDOW JOINS THE PARTY AS GUIDE.    Subsequently however a gin who was a widow, with the little girl  above-mentioned, whose age might be about four years, was persuaded by  him to accompany us.    HORSE KILLED.    At this camp, just after I had inspected the horses and particularly  noticed one as the second best draught animal we had, I was requested by  the overseer to look at him again, both bones of his near thigh having  been broken by an unlucky kick from a mare. The horse had been with me on  two former expeditions, and it was with great regret that I consented to  his being shot. We were enabled to regale the old native with his flesh,  the men shrewdly giving him to understand through Piper that the horse  was with us what the emu was with them, too good a thing to be eaten by  young men. He seemed to relish it much and next morning we left him  roasting a large piece.    THE BALYAN ROOT.    The principal food of these inhabitants of the Kalare or Lachlan appeared  to be balyan, the rhizoma, as already stated, of a monocotyledonous plant  or bulrush growing amongst the reeds. It contains so much gluten that one  of our party, Charles Webb, made in a short time some excellent cakes of  it; and they seemed to me lighter and sweeter than those prepared from  common flour.    HOW GATHERED.    The natives gather the roots and carry them on their heads in great  bundles within a piece of net. The old man came thus loaded to the fire  where the blind child was seated; and indeed this was obviously their  chief food among the marshes.    May 3.    We proceeded nearly west according to the suggestion of our female guide.  We crossed, at a few miles from Combedyega, my track in the afternoon of  April 23rd; and soon after we entered on plains similar to those which we  had traversed that day:    The morn was wasted in the pathless grass,  And long and lonesome was the wild to pass.    REACH THE UNITED CHANNEL OF THE LACHLAN.    We saw however the river-line of trees on our left, and late in the day  we approached it. Here I recognised the Lachlan again united in a single  channel, which looked as capacious as it was above, the only difference  being that the yarra trees seemed low and of stunted growth. A singular  appearance on the bushes which grew on the immediate bank attracted my  attention. A paper-like substance hung over them in the manner in which  linen is sometimes thrown over a hedge; but on examination it appeared to  be the dried scum of stagnant water. This--marks of water on the trees  and the less water-worn character of the banks which were of even slope  and grassy--seemed to show that the current of the river during floods  here loses its force, and that the water is consequently slower in  subsiding than higher up the stream.    NO WATER.    The course of the river was very tortuous, but still I in vain traced the  channel for water, even in the sharpest of its turnings, until long after  it was quite dark. We encamped at length near a small muddy hole  discovered with the assistance of our female guide, after having  travelled nineteen miles. I found the latitude of this camp to be 33  degrees 52 minutes 59 seconds, which was so near that of Mr. Oxley's  lowest point according to his book that I concluded we must be close to  it. Fortunately we found some natives at this waterhole who told us that  a long while ago white men had been encamped on the opposite side of the  Kalare, and that the place where they had marked a tree was not very far  distant, but that it had recently been burnt down. We saw today for the  first time on the Kalare the red-top cockatoo (Plyctolophus leadbeateri).    NATIVES' ACCOUNT OF THE RIVERS LOWER DOWN.    May 4.    This morning it rained and, considering the long journey of yesterday, I  gave the cattle rest. Here the natives again told us of Oolawambiloa,  near a great river coming from the north, and only five days' journey  from where we should make the Murrumbidgee. They also told us that the  latter river was joined by another coming from the south before it  reached Oolawambiloa.    We had now therefore the direct testimony of the natives that the Darling  (for it could be no other) joined the Murray and that the river Lachlan  did not lose its channel here as supposed by Mr. Oxley, but that in five  days' journey further we might expect to trace it into the Murrumbidgee.    MR. OXLEY'S LOWEST CAMP ON THE LACHLAN.    May 5.    The ground being very heavy the cattle in the carts proceeded but slowly  along the plains to the northward of the Lachlan; and while the party  followed Mr. Stapylton I went along the bank with the natives to visit  Mr. Oxley's last camp, which was not above a mile from that we had left.  On my way I crossed a bed of"]]]
