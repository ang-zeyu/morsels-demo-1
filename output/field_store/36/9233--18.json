Sometimes I thought Truth had vanished from the earth,\" he cried  bitterly.  \"Like everything else, it was rationed by the governments.  I taught myself to disbelieve half of what I read in the papers.  I saw  the world clawing itself to shreds in blind rage.  I saw hardly any one  brave enough to face the brutalizing absurdity as it really was, and  describe it.  I saw the glutton, the idler, and the fool applauding,  while brave and simple men walked in the horrors of hell.  The  stay-at-home poets turned it to pretty lyrics of glory and sacrifice.  Perhaps half a dozen of them have told the truth.  Have you read  Sassoon?  Or Latzko's Men in War, which was so damned true that the  government suppressed it?  Humph!  Putting Truth on rations!\"    He knocked out his pipe against his heel, and his blue eyes shone with  a kind of desperate earnestness.    \"But I tell you, the world is going to have the truth about War.  We're  going to put an end to this madness.  It's not going to be easy.  Just  now, in the intoxication of the German collapse, we're all rejoicing in  our new happiness.  I tell you, the real Peace will be a long time  coming.  When you tear up all the fibres of civilization it's a slow  job to knit things together again.  You see those children going down  the street to school?  Peace lies in their hands.  When they are taught  in school that war is the most loathsome scourge humanity is subject  to, that it smirches and fouls every lovely occupation of the mortal  spirit, then there may be some hope for the future.  But I'd like to  bet they are having it drilled into them that war is a glorious and  noble sacrifice.    \"The people who write poems about the divine frenzy of going over the  top are usually those who dipped their pens a long, long way from the  slimy duckboards of the trenches.  It's funny how we hate to face  realities.  I knew a commuter once who rode in town every day on the  8.13.  But he used to call it the 7.73.  He said it made him feel more  virtuous.\"    There was a pause, while Roger watched some belated urchins hurrying  toward school.    \"I think any man would be a traitor to humanity who didn't pledge every  effort of his waking life to an attempt to make war impossible in  future.\"    \"Surely no one would deny that,\" said Titania.  \"But I do think the war  was very glorious as well as very terrible.  I've known lots of men who  went over, knowing well what they were to face, and yet went gladly and  humbly in the thought they were going for a true cause.\"    \"A cause which is so true shouldn't need the sacrifice of millions of  fine lives,\" said Roger gravely.  \"Don't imagine I don't see the  dreadful nobility of it.  But poor humanity shouldn't be asked to be  noble at such a cost.  That's the most pitiful tragedy of it all.  Don't you suppose the Germans thought they too were marching off for a  noble cause when they began it and forced this misery on the world?  They had been educated to believe so, for a generation.  That's the  terrible hypnotism of war, the brute mass-impulse, the pride and  national spirit, the instinctive simplicity of men that makes them  worship what is their own above everything else.  I've thrilled and  shouted with patriotic pride, like everyone.  Music and flags and men  marching in step have bewitched me, as they do all of us.  And then  I've gone home and sworn to root this evil instinct out of my soul.  God help us--let's love the world, love humanity--not just our own  country!  That's why I'm so keen about the part we're going to play at  the Peace Conference.  Our motto over there will be America Last!  Hurrah for us, I say, for we shall be the only nation over there with  absolutely no axe to grind.  Nothing but a pax to grind!\"    It argued well for Titania's breadth of mind that she was not dismayed  nor alarmed at the poor bookseller's anguished harangue.  She surmised  sagely that he was cleansing his bosom of much perilous stuff.  In some  mysterious way she had learned the greatest and rarest of the spirit's  gifts--toleration.    \"You can't help loving your country,\" she said.    \"Let's go indoors,\" he answered.  \"You'll catch cold out here.  I want  to show you my alcove of books on the war.\"    \"Of course one can't help loving one's country,\" he added.  \"I love  mine so much that I want to see her take the lead in making a new era  possible.  She has sacrificed least for war, she should be ready to  sacrifice most for peace.  As for me,\" he said, smiling, \"I'd be  willing to sacrifice the whole Republican party!\"    \"I don't see why you call the war an absurdity,\" said Titania.  \"We HAD  to beat Germany, or where would civilization have been?\"    \"We had to beat Germany, yes, but the absurdity lies in the fact that  we had to beat ourselves in doing it.  The first thing you'll find,  when the Peace Conference gets to work, will be that we shall have to  help Germany onto her feet again so that she can be punished in an  orderly way.  We shall have to feed her and admit her to commerce so  that she can pay her indemnities--we shall have to police her cities to  prevent revolution from burning her up--and the upshot of it all will  be that men will have fought the most terrible war in history, and  endured nameless horrors, for the privilege of nursing their enemy back  to health.  If that isn't an absurdity, what is?  That's what happens  when a great nation like Germany goes insane.    \"Well, we're up against some terribly complicated problems.  My only  consolation is that I think the bookseller can play as useful a part as  any man in rebuilding the world's sanity.  When I was fretting over  what I could do to help things along, I came across two lines in my  favourite poet that encouraged me.  Good old George Herbert says:                  A grain of glory mixed with humblenesse              Cures both a fever and lethargicknesse.      \"Certainly running a second-hand bookstore is a pretty humble calling,  but I've mixed a grain of glory with it, in my own imagination at any  rate.  You see, books contain the thoughts and dreams of men, their  hopes and strivings and all their immortal parts.  It's in books that  most of us learn how splendidly worth-while life is.  I never realized  the greatness of the human spirit, the indomitable grandeur of man's  mind, until I read Milton's Areopagitica.  To read that great outburst  of splendid anger ennobles the meanest of us simply because we belong  to the same species of animal as Milton.  Books are the immortality of  the race, the father and mother of most that is worth while cherishing  in our hearts.  To spread good books about, to sow them on fertile  minds, to propagate understanding and a carefulness of life and beauty,  isn't that high enough mission for a man?  The bookseller is the real  Mr. Valiant-For-Truth.    \"Here's my War-alcove,\" he went on.  \"I've stacked up here most of the  really good books the War has brought out.  If humanity has sense  enough to take these books to heart, it will never get itself into this  mess again.  Printer's ink has been running a race against gunpowder  these many, many years.  Ink is handicapped, in a way, because you can  blow up a man with gunpowder in half a second, while it may take twenty  years to blow him up with a book.  But the gunpowder destroys itself  along with its victim, while a book can keep on exploding for  centuries.  There's Hardy's Dynasts for example.  When you read that  book you can feel it blowing up your mind.  It leaves you gasping, ill,  nauseated--oh, it's not pleasant to feel some really pure intellect  filtered into one's brain!  It hurts!  There's enough T. N. T. in that  book to blast war from the face of the globe.  But there's a slow fuse  attached to it.  It hasn't really exploded yet.  Maybe it won't for  another fifty years.    \"In regard to the War, think what books have accomplished.  What was  the first thing all the governments started to do--publish books!  Blue  Books, Yellow Books, White Books, Red Books--everything but Black  Books, which would have been appropriate in Berlin.  They knew that  guns and troops were helpless unless they could get the books on their  side, too.  Books did as much as anything else to bring America into  the war.  Some German books helped to wipe the Kaiser off his throne--I  Accuse, and Dr. Muehlon's magnificent outburst The Vandal of Europe,  and Lichnowsky's private memorandum, that shook Germany to her  foundations, simply because he told the truth.  Here's that book Men in  War, written I believe by a Hungarian officer, with its noble  dedication \"To Friend and Foe.\"  Here are some of the French  books--books in which the clear, passionate intellect of that race,  with its savage irony, burns like a flame.  Romain Rolland's Au-Dessus  de la Melee, written in exile in Switzerland; Barbusse's terrible Le  Feu; Duhamel's bitter Civilization; Bourget's strangely fascinating  novel The Meaning of Death.  And the noble books that have come out of  England:  A Student in Arms; The Tree of Heaven; Why Men Fight, by  Bertrand Russell--I'm hoping he'll write one on Why Men Are Imprisoned:  you know he was locked up for his sentiments!  And here's one of the  most moving of all--The Letters of Arthur Heath, a gentle, sensitive  young Oxford tutor who was killed on the Western front.  You ought to  read that book.  It shows the entire lack of hatred on the part of the  English.

[Illustration: Map]    THE RUSSIANS INVADE TURKEY IN ASIA.--In the early months of 1916  Russian troops met with success in an offensive in the part of Turkey  south of the Caucasus. This territory, known as Arme'nia, is inhabited  by a Christian population who for many years had been the victims of  Turkish persecutions; half a million were cruelly exterminated after  Turkey allied herself with Germany in 1914. The Russians advanced  steadily, inflicting serious defeats upon the Turkish forces. In  February they took possession of Erz'erum, a strongly fortified city of  Armenia. The capture of this point was of importance because it was a  step in the plan for cooeperation with the British armies which were  pushing their way north from the region of the Persian Gulf. It had the  further important result of interrupting Turkish plans for an invasion  of Egypt by way of the Isthmus of Suez, as Turkey was compelled to  concentrate her power for the defense of her own territory.    In April, Treb'izond, the most important city on the Turkish shore of  the Black Sea, surrendered to the invading Russian army. The Russians,  supported by fleets along the coast, had made the defense of the city  impossible. The fall of Trebizond was a very serious blow to the power  of Turkey in Asia Minor.    THE CAMPAIGN IN MESOPOTAMIA.--Part of the Allied plan in the east was  for the junction of Russian armies operating from the region of the  Caucasus with British troops from the land around the Persian Gulf.  While the Russians, as we have seen, were making a noteworthy success of  their part of this program, the British had not been so fortunate. Their  plan was to take possession of Mesopotamia, the valley of the  Tigris-Euphrates, and occupy its capital, the famous city of Bagdad.  General Townshend with an insufficient force had begun his march up the  Tigris River the year before and in March, 1915, had occupied the  stronghold of Kut-el-Ama'ra, about 100 miles below Bagdad. Here later he  was besieged by a Turkish army. A Russian army on the way from Erzerum  and an English relief force from the south failed to reach the place in  time, and April 29, 1916, General Townshend was forced by starvation to  surrender.    RUSSIAN SUCCESSES IN AUSTRIA.--During the summer months the Russians  under the command of one of their greatest leaders, General Bru'silov,  renewed their offensive against the border lands of Austria-Hungary. It  looked for a while as if the disasters of 1915 in this region were about  to be redeemed. On a wide front extending from the Prip'et marshes in  eastern Poland all the way to Bukowina (boo-ko-vee'nah), the Austrian  province southeast of Galicia, the Russian armies advanced. They invaded  Galicia and took hundreds of thousands of Austrian prisoners. Austria  was compelled to transfer troops from her Italian front. The year 1916  closed with the Russians in a decidedly more favorable military position  than they had occupied a year before.    ROUMANIA IN THE WAR.--Roumania had long looked forward to an extension  of her boundaries to include all the Roumanians of southeastern Europe.  Across the border, in southeastern Hungary, were more than two million  Roumanians living in the large region known as Transylvania. The  annexation of Transylvania was one of the greatest ambitions of  Roumanian leaders. In August, 1916, encouraged by the promises of  Russia, her powerful neighbor and protector, Roumania entered the war on  the side of the Allies.    On her western front Roumania could easily defend herself from invasion  because of strong mountain barriers. Her point of danger was the  Bulgarian boundary between the Danube and the Black Sea. Here she should  have concentrated her strength for defense against the Bulgarian forces  or even for an offensive into Bulgaria. Instead she sent most of her  armies west into Transylvania. Presently a strong force of Germans and  Bulgarians crossed the border into southeastern Roumania (the Dobrudja)  and marched north in a resistless offensive. Meanwhile the Roumanians in  Transylvania, far from their base of supplies, had advanced too fast for  safety. Moreover, they suffered from a shortage of ammunition, probably  caused by the failure of certain pro-German Russian officials to  cooeperate with the Roumanians as they had promised. A large German army  attacked the Roumanian forces and drove them back with heavy losses to  their own borders. The boundaries were then crossed by the invaders and  the greater part of the country occupied. This disaster brought enormous  advantages to the enemy. The battle front of the Central Powers was  shortened by five hundred miles, the oil and wheat fields which  constitute the chief wealth of Roumania fell into their hands, and their  communications with Turkey were materially strengthened.    THE ITALIAN FRONT.--The winter of 1915-1916 was uncommonly severe in  the Alps; snow thirty feet deep lay on some of the passes, and military  operations were brought almost to a standstill. During the spring the  Austrians made preparations for a great offensive against Italy,  collecting over a third of a million of men and enormous stores of  provisions and munitions. During May and June, 1916, this Austrian force  drove back the Italians from their advanced positions in the Trentino  valley. It seemed that the enemy would enter the valley of the Po and  capture the cities of the most prosperous part of Italy. But the farther  the Austrian army advanced, the more difficult it was to bring supplies  up the narrow Alpine valleys. Meantime, on the eastern frontier the  Russians began their great drive into Austrian territory. There was  nothing for the Austrians to do but retire from the Trentino front. This  they did with the loss of one third of their force, and of great  quantities of war material.    The Italians now took the offensive, not only on the Trentino, but also  on their eastern frontier, where, the year before, they had begun an  advance toward the \"unredeemed\" territory around Trieste (map, page 50).  The Ison'zo River was crossed and after months of warfare the city and  fortresses of Gorizia (go-rit'si-a) were occupied (August 9, 1916). From  this point the Italians continued slowly, overcoming great difficulties,  on their way toward Trieste.    THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND, MAY 31, 1916.--A minor division of the British  fleet under Admiral Beatty was scouting in the neighborhood of Jutland  (the peninsula of Denmark). The main German fleet came out to attack  it. The small British squadron, instead of withdrawing, gave battle to  the whole German high seas fleet. After the fighting had gone on for  several hours in fog and mist, the British grand fleet approached, but  night came on before a decision was reached. During the night the German  fleet retired back of the defenses of mines and shore batteries. In the  battle the British fleet had lost three battle cruisers and fifteen or  sixteen other vessels. The German losses were not completely published  but were certainly heavier. The Germans claimed a victory, and a general  holiday was ordered that all might celebrate. Nevertheless, the British  vessels were on the scene the next morning picking up survivors, while  the German fleet has not (up to the present writing) come out of harbor  in order that it might try to repeat its so-called victory.    SUBMARINE WARFARE.--During the year 1916 Germans continued with  increasing success their policy of sinking merchant vessels, neutral and  enemy. Out of a total of nearly 4,000,000 tons of shipping destroyed  from the beginning of the war to January 1, 1917, more than half was  lost during 1916. Occasional loss of life also caused much doubt on the  part of our government as to whether Germany was keeping her pledge to  safeguard the lives of noncombatants on torpedoed liners.    When a passenger steamer, the \"Sussex,\" plying between England and  France, was torpedoed without warning (March 24, 1916), eighty of the  passengers were killed or injured, two of the latter being Americans.  Germany at first said that one of her submarines had torpedoed a vessel  in the vicinity, but not the \"Sussex.\" The finding of fragments of a  German torpedo on the \"Sussex\" after it was brought into port  conclusively proved that the Germans were responsible, and that Germany  had broken her promise. President Wilson addressed a note to the German  government, stating that he would sever diplomatic relations with it  unless Germany should both declare and effect an abandonment of her  unlawful methods of submarine warfare. Thereupon the German government  gave a written pledge that merchant ships \"shall not be sunk without  warning and without saving human lives, unless these ships attempt to  escape or offer resistance.\" This pledge was given on the condition that  the United States should demand that Great Britain observe certain  (disputed) rules of international law; but our government refused to  agree that Germany's respect for our neutral rights should be made to  depend on the conduct of other nations. President Wilson thus made clear  his intention to sever diplomatic relations if Germany's pledge should  be withdrawn or violated.    CONSCRIPTION IN GREAT BRITAIN.--The British government had kept up its  army by volunteering. The need of an army of five million could not  depend on this plan. A conscription bill therefore was passed making all  males between certain ages liable for military service. Ireland was  excepted from the provisions of this act.    SINN FEIN REBELLION.--Some of the more radical among the Irish Home  Rule party had formed an organization known as the Sinn Fein (shin f[=a]n),  an Irish phrase which means \"for ourselves.\" Their aim was to make  Ireland an independent"]]]
