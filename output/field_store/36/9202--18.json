The spire was not rebuilt,  but the roof was renewed. But fifty years later it was discovered that  the work had been fraudulently done, and the church was falling to  pieces. James I. came with much ceremony, in consequence of the  importunities which he received, to survey the cathedral,[1] and in  consequence of what he saw he appointed a commission to consider what  steps should be taken. At the head of it was the Lord Mayor, and  amongst the names is that of \"Inigo Jones, Esquire, Surveyor to his  Majesty's Works.\" This remarkable man, though he was born in the  parish of St. Bartholomew the Less, Smithfield, was educated in Italy,  through the generosity of Herbert, third Earl of Pembroke.    [Illustration: MONUMENT OF DR. DONNE. _After W. Hollar._]    [Illustration: PREACHING AT PAUL'S CROSS BEFORE JAMES I. _From a  painting by H. Farley. Collection of the Society of Antiquaries._]    [Illustration: OLD ST. PAUL'S FROM THE THAMES. _After W. Hollar._]    [Illustration: WEST FRONT AFTER THE FIRE. _From a drawing in the  Library of St. Paul's Cathedral._]      He now took the lead in the restoration of St. Paul's. It must be  acknowledged that after the first outburst of zeal following the  fire of 1561, St. Paul's was much neglected for many long years. The  authorities were lukewarm, the services were dead and unattractive,  and all manner of irreverence was seen there daily. Bishop Earle's  _Microcosmography_ (1628) often gets quoted, but his description  of \"Paule's Walke\" ought to find place here. I take it from a  contemporary MS. copy. Paul's Walk was the whole nave of the  cathedral:--\"Paule's Walke is the lande's epitomy, or you may call it,  the lesser Ile [Aisle] of Greate Brittayne. It is more than this,  the whole woorlde's map, which you may here discerne in its perfect  motion, justling and turning. It is an heape of stones and men, with  a vast confusion of languages, and were the steeple not sanctified,  nothing liker Babell. The noyse of it is like that of bees, an humming  buzze mixed with walking tongues, and feet. It is a kind of still  rore, or loude whisper. It is the greate exchange of all discourse,  and noe business whatsoever but it is here stirring and on foote. It  is the Synode of all pates politicke, jointed and layed together  in most serious postures; and they are not halfe soe busy at the  Parliament. It is the anticke of tayles to tayles, and backes to  backes, and for vizzards you neede goe noe further than faces. Tis  the market of young lecturers, which you may cheapen at all rates and  sizes. It is the generall mint of famous lyes, which are here (like  the legendes of Popery) first coyned, and stamped in the church. All  inventions are emptied here, and not few pockettes. The best signe of  a temple in it, is that it is the thieves' sanctuary, whoe rob here  more safely in a crowde than in a wildernesse, whilst every searcher  is a bush to hide them in. It is the other expence of a day after  playes and the taverne ... and men have still some othes left to  swear here.... The visitants are all men without exception, but the  principall inhabitants are stale knights and captains out of servis,  men with long rapiers and breeches, who after all turne merchant here,  and trafficke for news. Some make it a preface to dinner and travell  for a stomache, but thriftier men make it their ordinary, and boarde  here very cheape. Of all such places it is least troubled with  hobgoblins, for if a ghost would walk here he could not.\" Of \"the  singing men\" he draws a most unfavourable picture, accuses them of  drunkenness and shameful looseness of life; says that they are  earnest in evil deeds and that their work in the cathedral is their  recreation. Bishop Pilkington also speaks of the profanity and  worldliness of the daily frequenters. The carrying merchandise into  the building seems to have been the custom in many of the cathedrals,  and so it is not wonderful that the building went to ruin. The Bishop  of London, Laud, sent round exhortations to the City Companies to  contribute to the restoration. Here is his letter to the Barber  Surgeons, dated January 30th, 1632:--    \"To the right worshipful my very worthy friends the Master Wardens and  Assistants of the Company of Barber Surgeons, London, these:        \"_Salus in Christo._ After my very hearty commendations you cannot      but take notice of his Majesty's most honest and pious intention      for the repair of the decay of Saint Paul's Church here in London,      being the mother church of this City and Diocese, and the great      Cathedral of this Kingdom. A great dishonour it is, not only to      this City, but to the whole state to see that ancient and goodly      pile of building so decayed as it is, but it will be a far greater      if care should not be taken to prevent the fall of it into ruin.      And it would be no less disgrace to religion, happily established      in this kingdom, if it should have so little power over the minds      of men as not to prevail with them to keep those eminent places of      God's service in due and decent repair, which their forefathers      built in times, by their own confession, not so full of the      knowledge of God's truth as this present age is. I am not ignorant      how many worthy works have been done of late in and about this      City towards the building and repairing of churches, which makes      me hope that every man's purse will open to this great and      necessary work (according to God's blessing upon him), so much      tending to the service of God and the honour of this nation. The      general body of this City have done very worthily in their bounty      already, also the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Sheriffs severally,      for their own persons. These are, therefore, according to their      examples, heartily to pray and desire you, the Master Warden and      other assistants of the worthy Company of Barber Surgeons to      contribute out of your public stock to the work aforesaid, what      you out of your charity and devotion shall think fit, and to pay      the sum resolved on by you into the Chamber of London at or before      our Lady Day next, praying you that I may receive by any servant      of your Company a note what the sum is which you resolve to give.      And for this charity of yours, whatever it shall prove to be, I      shall not only give you hearty thanks, but be as ready to serve      you, and every of you, as you are to serve God and His Church. So,      not doubting of your love and forwarding to this great work, I      leave you to the grace of God, and shall so rest,      \"Your very loving Friend,    \"GUL: LONDON.\"      The Court considered this letter on the 9th of April following, and  agreed to pay L10 down, and the same sum each year for the next nine  years.    We must not omit one munificent donor who came forward now: Sir Paul  Pindar, who had made a large fortune as a Turkey merchant, and had  been sent by King James as Ambassador to Constantinople, gave over  L10,000 to the restoration of the cathedral. He died in 1650, and his  beautifully picturesque house remained in Bishopsgate Street (it had  been turned, like Crosby Hall, into a tavern) until 1890, when it was  pulled down. Some of the most striking portions of its architecture  are preserved in the Kensington Museum.    That the alterations and additions of Inigo Jones, under King James,  were altogether incongruous with the old building everybody will  admit. But there are excuses to be made. He knew very little about  Gothic architecture. The only example now remaining of his attempts in  this style is the Chapel of Lincoln's Inn. St. Katharine Cree in the  City has been attributed to him, but with little probability. And if  he had essayed to work in Gothic at St. Paul's, it would not have been  in accordance with precedent. Nearly all our great cathedrals display  endless varieties of style, because it was the universal practice of  our forefathers to work in the style current in their own time. We  rejoice to see Norman and Perpendicular under one roof, though they  represent periods 400 years apart. In the case before us Gothic  architecture had died out for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16534"],[0,"A Young Folks' History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (#16)"],[1,"for his capture.  Elder Rockwell was kidnapped and taken to Missouri, where he was  ill-treated, but at last escaped.    Thomas Ford now became governor of Illinois and to him Joseph went. The  governor prevailed upon Joseph to stand another trial, which was held at  Springfield, Illinois. Joseph was again proved innocent and released.    But the fiends from Missouri would not give up. Once again he was taken  while away from Nauvoo, by two officers, who abused him shamefully. I  cannot tell you all about his exciting adventures--that you must read in a  larger history--but at last he arrived safe again in Nauvoo.    Persecution continued. Mobs now gathered around Nauvoo. Threats were made  that mobs would come from Missouri, and join with those of Illinois,  against the \"Mormons.\" There was great unrest. When Joseph was spoken to  about the danger he was in, he said he was not exposed to as much danger  from outside enemies as from traitors within. \"_We have a Judas in our  midst_,\" he said.

CHAPTER XXIV.    THE MARTYRDOM.      On January 29, 1844, Joseph Smith was nominated for President of the United  States. Neither he nor his friends had much hopes of his election, but it  gave the citizens of Nauvoo at least a chance to vote for an honest man who  was their friend. Brethren were sent to various parts of the country to  make speeches in his favor, and Joseph published his views on how the  government should be conducted. One of his ideas was that the government  should set the negro slaves free, paying their masters for them. President  Abraham Lincoln, twenty years later, also favored this plan.    Meanwhile, Nauvoo prospered and the Church grew. When the weather would  permit, meetings were held in a grove near the temple, there being no room  large enough to hold the large crowds of people. Joseph continued to give  many glorious truths to the Church about the nature of God, the land of  Zion, baptism for the dead, and many other things.    The Prophet's prediction that there was a Judas in their midst soon proved  too true; and there were more than one. William Law, Joseph's second  counselor, William Marks, president of the Nauvoo Stake, with many other  leading men proved themselves false to Joseph and the Church. They even  planned with Joseph's enemies to have him killed. They were also proved  guilty of other sins and were therefore cut off from the Church. After  this, these men said Joseph was a fallen prophet, and so they organized a  church of their own. It did not amount to anything, however.    Joseph's periods of peace were not many. Apostates were his worst enemies,  and they were all the time annoying him by having him arrested on all  manner of false charges. These men were very bitter, and they howled around  him like a pack of wolves, eager to devour him; but Joseph trusted in the  Saints and they in him, for those who were faithful to their duties knew by  the Spirit of God that Joseph was not a fallen prophet.    In June, 1844, the enemies of the Saints began to publish a paper in  Nauvoo, called the _Expositor_. Its purpose was to deprive the people of  Nauvoo of their rights, so it boldly said. One paper was printed, and that  was so full of false statements and abuse against the city officials that  the city council declared it a nuisance and had the press, type, etc.,  destroyed.    This raised great excitement among the enemies of the Church. Joseph and  seventeen others were arrested, tried before a court in Nauvoo, and  acquitted; but this did not satisfy the mobbers. On the advice of the  United States judge for that district, Joseph and his brethren allowed  themselves to be arrested again and have a trial before Justice Daniel H.  Wells, then not a \"Mormon.\" They were again discharged as innocent of  crime.    Now mobs began to threaten again, but the Nauvoo Legion was ready to defend  the city. As the Legion was drawn up in front of Joseph's house one day--it  was the 18th of June--he got upon a platform and spoke to the soldiers.  That speech was long remembered by those who heard it. It thrilled them  through and through and at the word they would gladly have marched and met  the mob in battle; but that was not Joseph's way. He was always willing to  have the laws carried out even if he suffered thereby, so that his enemies  could have no just excuse. That was the Prophet Joseph Smith's last public  speech.    During the excitement Governor Ford arrived at Carthage, a town about  eighteen miles from Nauvoo, and the county seat of Hancock county. The  governor sent word to Nauvoo that he wanted some explanation of the  trouble, so Joseph sent some of the brethren to him. The governor treated  his callers rudely. Carthage was full of mobs, and the governor seemed to  believe all they told him about the \"Mormons.\" He organized the mobs into  troops. Joseph asked the governor to come to Nauvoo and investigate the  whole matter; but no: Joseph must go to Carthage. The governor said he  would protect him if he would go.    It was on the evening of June 22nd. Joseph and Hyrum had called some  brethren together: \"All they want is Hyrum and myself,\" said the Prophet.  Joseph and Hyrum both seemed certain that if their enemies got them in  their power again they would be killed. Joseph then proposed that he and  Hyrum should escape to the Rocky Mountains. Preparations for this trip were  made and they were rowed over the river to Iowa, when Joseph's wife sent  some of the brethren to plead with him to return. Some brethren also found  fault with him in running away to \"leave the flock to the wolves.\"    Joseph replied, \"If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to  myself.\" So they went back, Joseph saying, \"We shall be butchered.\"    On the morning of June 24th Joseph and eighteen brethren set out for  Carthage to be tried again on the old charge. As he rode out the Prophet  made many expressions of goodby to his friends. Four miles from Carthage  they met a company of militia going to Nauvoo with an order from the  governor that the Nauvoo Legion give up its arms. Joseph rode back with  them to see that this was done. Twice he bade his family farewell. His face  was pale, and he was suffering.    \"I am going like a lamb to the slaughter,\" he said, \"but I am calm as a  summer morning.\"    At Carthage they were received with oaths and threats by the troops.  Apostates and soldiers swore that the brethren would never leave Carthage  alive.    The next day the governor paraded the prisoners before the troops, who  insulted them as they passed along. Then they were placed in the jail  awaiting their trial.    [Illustration: CARTHAGE JAIL.]    The day following, the prisoners were marched to the court house, guarded  by the troops; but the trial was postponed until the next day, and the  brethren were taken back to jail.    This was the 26th of June. That night Joseph was lying on the floor with  some of the brethren. Brother Dan Jones was on one side and Brother John S.  Fullmer on the other.    \"Lay your head on my arm for a pillow, Brother John,\" said Joseph, and  then he talked with him in a low tone. Joseph expressed a desire to see his  family again and preach to the Saints once more.    To Brother Jones he whispered, \"Are you afraid to die?\" When Brother Jones  said he was not, Joseph replied, \"You will yet see Wales, and fulfill the  mission appointed you, before you die.\" (Dan Jones did a wonderful  missionary work in Wales.)    The next morning the guards frequently told some of the brethren that if  they did not wish to be killed they had better get away from Joseph. This  was told to Governor Ford, but he paid no attention to it.    At 10:30 that morning, June 27, the governor with the most friendly of the  troops left for Nauvoo, and the brethren were left to their fate.    In an upper room of Carthage jail, Joseph, Hyrum, John Taylor, and Willard  Richards were spending their time in writing letters, singing, talking, and  praying. In the afternoon Joseph asked Elder Taylor to sing the hymn,  commencing:    \"A poor wayfaring man of grief.\"    And when it was done he asked him to sing it again. Brother Taylor said he  could hardly sing it, he felt so sad, but he sang the hymn again.    About 5 o'clock in the afternoon a mob of about two hundred men surrounded  the jail. They had blackened their faces with powder and mud. Then the  firing began. The mob rushed up the stairs, shooting into the room where  the four brethren were. The prisoners sprang to the door to close it but  the guns of the mob forced it open. Elders Taylor and Richards tried to  push the guns aside with their canes. The bullets flew like hail into the  room. One ball came through the door and struck Hyrum in the head. Four  others hit him, and he fell back saying:    \"_I am a dead man_.\"    Joseph gazed on his brother and exclaimed: \"Oh! dear brother Hyrum!\"    Elder Taylor now tried to jump from the window. A ball struck him, and he  was about to fall from the window, when another bullet from the outside hit  his watch in his vest pocket and threw him back into the room. Here he was  hit by two more balls, and he rolled under the bed.    Then Joseph went"]]]
