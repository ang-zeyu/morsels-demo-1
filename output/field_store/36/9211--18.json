XX                 IS AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE A CRANK'S HOBBY?    The apostle of a universal language is made to feel pretty plainly that  he is regarded as a crank. He may console himself with the usual defence  that a crank is that which makes revolutions; but for all that, it is  chilling to be met with a certain smile.    Let us analyse that smile. It varies in intensity, ranging from the  scathing sneer damnatory to the gentle dimple deprecatory. But in any  case it belongs to the category of the smile that won't come off. I know  that grin--it comes from Cheshire.    What, then, do we mean when we smile at a crank? Firstly and generally  that we think his ideal impracticable. But it has been shown that an  international language is not impracticable. This alone ought to go far  towards removing it from the list of cranks' hobbies.    Secondly, we often mean that the ideal in question is opposed to common  sense--e.g. when we smile at a man who lives on protein biscuits or  walks about without a hat. We do not impugn the feasibility of his diet  or apparel, but we think he is going out of his way to be peculiar  without reaping adequate advantage by his departure from customary  usage.    The test of \"crankiness,\" then, lies in the adequacy of the advantage  reaped. A man who learns and uses Esperanto may at present depart as  widely from ordinary usage as a patron of Eustace Miles's restaurant  or a member of the hatless brigade; but is it true that the advantage  thereby accruing is equally disputable or matter of opinion? Is it not,  on the contrary, fairly certain that the use of an auxiliary language,  if universal, would open up for many regions from which exclusion is now  felt as a hindrance?    Take the case of a doctor, scientist, scholar, researcher in any branch  of knowledge, who desires to keep abreast of the advance of knowledge in  his particular line. He may have to wait for years before a translation  of some work he wishes to read is published in a tongue he knows, and in  any case all the periodical literature of every nation, except the one  or two whose languages he may learn, will be closed to him. The output  of learned work is increasing very fast in all civilized countries, and  therefore results are recorded in an increasing number of languages in  monographs, reports, transactions, and the specialist press. A move  is being made in the right direction by the proposal to print the  publications of the Brussels International Bibliographical Institute in  Esperanto.    Take a few examples of the hampering effect upon scholarly work of the  language difficulty as it already exists. The diffusion of learning  will, ironically enough, increase the difficulty.[1] The late Prof.  Todhunter, of Cambridge, was driven to learning Russian for mathematical  purposes. He managed to learn enough to enable him to read mathematical  treatises; but how many mathematicians or scientists (or classical  scholars, for that matter) could do as much? And of how much profit was  the learning of Russian, _quâ_ Russian, to Prof. Todhunter? It only took  up time which could have been better spent, as there cannot be anything  very uplifting or cultivating in the language of mathematical Russian.       [1]By multiplying the languages used.    Prof. Max Müller proposed that all serious scientific work should be  published in one of the six languages following--English, French,  German, Italian, Spanish, and Latin. But why should other nations have  to produce in these languages? and why should serious students have to  be prepared to read six languages?    All this was many years ago. The balance of culture has since then been  gradually but steadily shifting in favour of other peoples. The present  writer had occasion to make a special study of Byron's influence on the  Continent. It turned out that one of the biggest and most important  works upon the subject was written in Polish. It has therefore remained  inaccessible. This is only an illustration of a difficulty that faces  many workers.    Thirdly, there is a good large portion of the British public that  regards as a crank anything not British or that does not benefit  themselves personally. It really _is_ hard for an Englishman, Frenchman,  or German, brought up among a homogeneous people of old civilization,  to realize the extent of the incubus under which the smaller nations  of Europe and the polyglot empires further east are groaning. Imagine  yourself an educated Swiss, Dutchman, or a member of any of the thirty  or forty nationalities that make up the Austrian or Russian Empires.  How would you like to have to learn three or four foreign languages for  practical purposes before you could hope to take much of a position in  life? Can any one assert that the kind of grind required, with its heavy  taxation of the memory, is in most cases really educative or confers  culture?    Think it out. What do you really mean when you jeer at an Esperantist?                                        XXI                     WHAT AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE IS NOT    An international language is not an attempt to replace or damage in any  way any existing language or literature.                                        XXII                       WHAT AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE IS    An international language is an attempt to save the greatest amount of  labour and open the widest fields of thought and action to the greatest  number.                                          PART II                                   HISTORICAL                                         I          SOME EXISTING INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGES ALREADY IN PARTIAL USE    Though the idea of an artificially constructed language to meet the  needs of speakers of various tongues seems for some reason to contain  something absurd or repellent to the mind of Western Europeans, there  have, as a matter of fact, been various attempts made at different times  and places to overcome the obvious difficulty in the obvious way; and  all have met with a large measure of success.    The usual method of procedure has been quite rough and ready. Words  or forms have been taken from a variety of languages, and simply  mixed up together, without any scientific attempt at co-ordination or  simplification. The resulting international languages have varied in  their degree of artificiality, and in the proportions in which they were  consciously or semi-consciously compiled, or else adopted their elements  ready-made, without conscious adaptation, from existing tongues. But  their production, widespread and continuous use, and great practical  utility, showed that they arose in response to a felt want. The wonder  is that the world should have grown so old without supplying this want  in a more systematic way.    Every one has heard of the _lingua franca_ of the Levant. In India the  master-language that carries a man through among a hundred different  tribes is Hindustanee, or Urdu. At the outset it represented a new need  of an imperial race. It had its origin during the latter half of the  sixteenth century under Akbar, and was born of the sudden extension  of conquest and affairs brought about by the great ruler. Round him  gathered a cosmopolitan crowd of courtiers, soldiers, vassal princes,  and followers of all kinds, and wider dealings than the ordinary local  petty affairs received a great stimulus. Urdu is a good example of a  mix-up language, with a pure Aryan framework developed out of a dialect  of the old Hindi. In fact, it is to India very much what Esperanto might  be to Europe, only it is more empirical, and not so consciously and  scientifically worked out.    Somewhat analogous to Urdu, in that it is a literary language used  by the educated classes for intercommunication throughout a polygot  empire, is the Mandarin Chinese. If China is not \"polygot\" in the strict  technical sense of the term, she is so in fact, since the dialects used  in different provinces are mutually incomprehensible for the speakers of  them. Mandarin is the official master-language.    Rather of the nature of _patois_ are Pidgin-English, Chinook, and  Benguela, the language used throughout the tribes of the Congo. Yet  business of great importance and involving large sums of money is, or  has been, transacted in them, and they are used over a wide area.    Pidgin consists of a medley of words, largely English, but with a  considerable admixture from other tongues, combined in the framework  of Chinese construction. It is current in ports all over the East,  and is by no means confined to China. The principle is that roots,  chiefly monosyllabic, are used in their crude form without inflection  or agglutination, the mere juxtaposition (without any change of form)  showing whether they are verbs, adjectives, etc. This is the Chinese  contribution to the language.    Chinook is the key-language to dealings with the huge number of  different tribes of American Indians. It contains a large admixture of  French words, and was to a great extent artificially put together by the  Hudson Bay Company's officials, for the purposes of their business.    Quite apart from these various more or less consciously constructed  mixed languages, there is a much larger artificial element in many  national languages than is commonly realized. Take modern Hungarian,  Greek, or even Italian. Literary Italian, as we know it, is largely an  artificial construction for literary purposes, made by Dante and others,  on the basis of a vigorous and naturally supple dialect. With modern  Greek this is even more strikingly the case. As a national language  it is almost purely the work of a few scholars, who in modern times  arbitrarily and artificially revived and modified the ancient Greek.    There seems, then, to be absolutely no foundation in experience "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16751"],[0,"McGuffey's Sixth Eclectic Reader (#16)"],[1,"that  most powerfully attracts our notice, rendering us peculiarly sensitive to  every accidental sound that meets the ear. In the morning, at this time of  year, on the contrary, we are overpowered by the vocal and multitudinous  chorus of the feathered tribe. If you would hear the commencement of this  grand anthem of nature, you must rise at the very first appearance of  dawn, before the twilight has formed a complete semicircle above the  eastern porch of heaven.    The first note that proceeds from the little warbling host, is the shrill  chirp of the hairbird,--occasionally vocal at an hours on a warm summer  night. This strain, which is a continued trilling sound, is repeated with  diminishing intervals, until it becomes almost incessant. But ere the  hairbird has uttered many notes, a single robin begins to warble from a  neighboring orchard, soon followed by others, increasing in numbers until,  by the time the eastern sky is flushed with crimson, every male, robin in  the country round is singing with fervor.    It would be difficult to note the exact order in which the different birds  successively begin their parts in this performance; but the bluebird,  whose song is only a short, mellow warble, is heard nearly at the same  time with the robin, and the song sparrow joins them soon after with his  brief but finely modulated strain. The different species follow rapidly,  one after another, in the chorus, until the whole welkin rings with their  matin hymn of gladness.    I have often wondered that the almost simultaneous utterance of so many  different notes should produce no discords, and that they should result in  such complete harmony. In this multitudinous confusion of voices, no two  notes are confounded, and none has sufficient duration to grate harshly  with a dissimilar sound. Though each performer sings only a few strains  and then makes a pause, the whole multitude succeed one another with such  rapidity that we hear an uninterrupted flow of music until the broad light  of day invites them to other employments.    When there is just light enough to distinguish the birds, we may observe,  here and there, a single swallow perched on the roof of a barn or shed,  repeating two twittering notes incessantly, with a quick turn and a hop at  every note he utters. It would seem to be the design of the bird to  attract the attention of his mate, and this motion seems to be made to  assist her in discovering his position. As soon as the light has tempted  him to fly abroad, this twittering strain is uttered more like a continued  song, as he flits rapidly through the air.    But at this later moment the purple martins have commenced their more  melodious chattering, so loud as to attract for a while the most of our  attention. There is not a sound in nature so cheering and animating as the  song of the purple martin, and none so well calculated to drive away  melancholy. Though not one of the earliest voices to be heard, the chorus  is perceptibly more loud and effective when this bird has united with the  choir.    When the flush of the morning has brightened into vermilion, and the place  from which the sun is soon to emerge has attained a dazzling brilliancy,  the robins are already less tuneful. They are now becoming busy in  collecting food for their morning repast, and one by one they leave the  trees, and may be seen hopping upon the tilled ground, in quest of the  worms and insects that, have crept out during the night from their  subterranean retreats.    But as the robins grow silent, the bobolinks begin their vocal revelries;  and to a fanciful mind it might seem that the robins had gradually  resigned their part in the performance to the bobolinks, not one of which  is heard until some of the former have concluded their songs. The little  hairbird still continues his almost incessant chirping, the first to begin  and the last to quit the performance. Though the voice of this bird is not  very sweetly modulated, it blends harmoniously with the notes of other  birds, and greatly increases the charming effect of the combination.    It would be tedious to name all the birds that take part in this chorus;  but we must not omit the pewee, with his melancholy ditty, occasionally  heard like a short minor strain in an oratorio; nor the oriole, who is  really one of the chief performers, and who, as his bright plumage flashes  upon the sight, warbles forth a few notes so clear and mellow as to be  beard above every other sound. Adding a pleasing variety to all this  harmony, the lisping notes of the meadowlark, uttered in a shrill tone,  and with a peculiar pensive modulation, are plainly audible, with short  rests between each repetition.    There is a little brown sparrow, resembling the hairbird, save a general  tint of russet in his plumage, that may be heard distinctly among the  warbling host. He is rarely seen in cultivated grounds, but frequents the  wild pastures, and is the bird that warbles so sweetly at midsummer, when  the whortleberries are ripe, and the fields are beautifully spangled with  red lilies.    There is no confusion in the notes of his song, which consists of one  syllable rapidly repeated, but increasing in rapidity and rising to a  higher key towards the conclusion. He sometimes prolongs his strain, when  his notes are observed to rise and fall in succession. These plaintive and  expressive notes are very loud and constantly uttered, during the hour  that precedes the rising of the sun. A dozen warblers of this species,  singing in concert, and distributed in different parts of the field, form,  perhaps, the most delightful part of the woodland oratorio to which we  have listened.    At sunrise hardly a robin can be beard in the whole neighborhood, and the  character of the performance has completely changed during the last half  hour. The first part was more melodious and tranquilizing, the last is  more brilliant and animating. The grass finches, the vireos, the wrens,  and the linnets have joined their voices to the chorus, and the bobolinks  are loudest in their song. But the notes of the birds in general are not  so incessant as before sunrise. One by one they discontinue their lays,  until at high noon the bobolink and the warbling flycatcher are almost the  only vocalists to be heard in the fields.        XII. SHORT SELECTIONS IN POETRY. (94)    1. THE CLOUD.    A cloud lay cradled near the setting sun,    A gleam of crimson tinged its braided snow;  Long had I watched the glory moving on,    O'er the still radiance of the lake below:    Tranquil its spirit seemed, and floated slow,  E'en in its very motion there was rest,    While every breath of eve that chanced to blow,  Wafted the traveler to the beauteous west.  Emblem, methought, of the departed soul,    To whose white robe the gleam of bliss is given,  And by the breath of mercy made to roll    Right onward to the golden gate of heaven,  While to the eye of faith it peaceful lies,  And tells to man his glorious destinies.                                            --John Wilson      II. MY MIND.    My mind to me a kingdom is;    Such perfect joy therein I find,  As far exceeds all earthly bliss    That God or nature hath assigned;  Though much I want that most would have,  Yet still my mind forbids to crave.    NOTE.--This is the first stanza of a poem by William Byrd (b, 1543, d.  1623), an English composer of music.        III. A GOOD NAME. (95)    Good name, in man or woman, dear my lord,  Is the immediate jewel of their souls.  Who steals my purse, steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;  'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;  But he that filches from me my good name,  Robs me of that which not enriches him,  And makes me poor indeed.                               Shakespeare.--Othello, Act III, Scene III.        IV. SUNRISE.    But yonder comes the powerful king of day,  Rejoicing in the east. The lessening cloud,  The kindling azure, and the mountain's brow  Illumed with liquid gold, his near approach  Betoken glad. Lo! now apparent all,  Aslant the dew-bright earth and colored air  He looks in boundless majesty abroad,  And sheds the shining day that, burnished, plays  On rocks, and hills, and towers, and wandering streams,  High gleaming from afar.                                                          Thomson.        V. OLD AGE AND DEATH. (95)    Edmund Waller, 1605-1687, an English poet, was a cousin of John Hampden,  and related to Oliver Cromwell. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge.  Waller was for many years a member of Parliament. He took part in the  civil war, and was detected in a treasonable plot. Several years of his  life were spent in exile in France. After the Restoration he came into  favor at court. His poetry is celebrated for smoothness and sweetness, but  is disfigured by affected conceits.  ###        The seas are quiet when the winds give o'er;    So calm are we when passions are no more.    For then we know how vain it was to boast    Of fleeting things, too certain to be lost.    Clouds of affection from our younger eyes    Conceal that emptiness which age descries.    The soul's dark cottage, battered and decayed,    Lets in new light through chinks that time has made:    Stronger by weakness, wiser men become,    As they draw near to their eternal home.    Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view,    That stand upon the threshold of the new.        VI. MILTON. (96)    John Dryden, 1631-1703, was a noted English writer, who was made poet  laureate by James II. On the expulsion of James, and the accession of  William and Mary, Dryden lost his offices and pension, and was compelled  to earn his bread by literary work. It was during these last years of his  life that his best work was done. His \"Ode for St. Cecilia's Day\" is one  of his most, celebrated poems. His prose writings are specimens of good,  strong English.  ###        Three poets, "]]]
