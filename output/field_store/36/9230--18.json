In former wars a serious wound meant usually death or  amputation. Now nearly ninety per cent. of the wounded are able to  continue in the service. The reason for this improvement is that  medicines are now being made to order instead of being gathered \"from  China to Peru.\" The old herb doctor picked up any strange plant that he  could find and tried it on any sick man that would let him. This  empirical method, though hard on the patients, resulted in the course of  five thousand years in the discovery of a number of useful remedies. But  the modern medicine man when he knows the cause of the disease is  usually able to devise ways of counteracting it directly. For instance,  he knows, thanks to Pasteur and Metchnikoff, that the cause of wound  infection is the bacterial enemies of man which swarm by the million  into any breach in his protective armor, the skin. Now when a breach is  made in a line of intrenchments the defenders rush troops to the  threatened spot for two purposes, constructive and destructive,  engineers and warriors, the former to build up the rampart with  sandbags, the latter to kill the enemy. So when the human body is  invaded the blood brings to the breach two kinds of defenders. One is  the serum which neutralizes the bacterial poison and by coagulating  forms a new skin or scab over the exposed flesh. The other is the  phagocytes or white corpuscles, the free lances of our corporeal  militia, which attack and kill the invading bacteria. The aim of the  physician then is to aid these defenders as much as possible without  interfering with them. Therefore the antiseptic he is seeking is one  that will assist the serum in protecting and repairing the broken  tissues and will kill the hostile bacteria without killing the friendly  phagocytes. Carbolic acid, the most familiar of the coal-tar  antiseptics, will destroy the bacteria when it is diluted with 250 parts  of water, but unfortunately it puts a stop to the fighting activities of  the phagocytes when it is only half that strength, or one to 500, so it  cannot destroy the infection without hindering the healing.    In this search for substances that would attack a specific disease germ  one of the leading investigators was Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a German  physician of the Hebrew race. He found that the aniline dyes were useful  for staining slides under the microscope, for they would pick out  particular cells and leave others uncolored and from this starting point  he worked out organic and metallic compounds which would destroy the  bacteria and parasites that cause some of the most dreadful of diseases.  A year after the war broke out Professor Ehrlich died while working in  his laboratory on how to heal with coal-tar compounds the wounds  inflicted by explosives from the same source.    One of the most valuable of the aniline antiseptics employed by Ehrlich  is flavine or, if the reader prefers to call it by its full name,  diaminomethylacridinium chloride. Flavine, as its name implies, is a  yellow dye and will kill the germs causing ordinary abscesses when in  solution as dilute as one part of the dye to 200,000 parts of water, but  it does not interfere with the bactericidal action of the white blood  corpuscles unless the solution is 400 times as strong as this, that is  one part in 500. Unlike carbolic acid and other antiseptics it is said  to stimulate the serum instead of impairing its activity. Another  antiseptic of the coal-tar family which has recently been brought into  use by Dr. Dakin of the Rockefeller Institute is that called by European  physicians chloramine-T and by American physicians chlorazene and by  chemists para-toluene-sodium-sulfo-chloramide.    This may serve to illustrate how a chemist is able to make such remedies  as the doctor needs, instead of depending upon the accidental  by-products of plants. On an earlier page I explained how by starting  with the simplest of ring-compounds, the benzene of coal tar, we could  get aniline. Suppose we go a step further and boil the aniline oil with  acetic acid, which is the acid of vinegar minus its water. This easy  process gives us acetanilid, which when introduced into the market some  years ago under the name of \"antifebrin\" made a fortune for its makers.    The making of medicines from coal tar began in 1874 when Kolbe made  salicylic acid from carbolic acid. Salicylic acid is a rheumatism remedy  and had previously been extracted from willow bark. If now we treat  salicylic acid with concentrated acetic acid we get \"aspirin.\" From  aniline again are made \"phenacetin,\" \"antipyrin\" and a lot of other  drugs that have become altogether too popular as headache remedies--say  rather \"headache relievers.\"    Another class of synthetics equally useful and likewise abused, are the  soporifics, such as \"sulphonal,\" \"veronal\" and \"medinal.\" When it is not  desired to put the patient to sleep but merely to render insensible a  particular place, as when a tooth is to be pulled, cocain may be used.  This, like alcohol and morphine, has proved a curse as well as a  blessing and its sale has had to be restricted because of the many  victims to the habit of using this drug. Cocain is obtained from the  leaves of the South American coca tree, but can be made artificially  from coal-tar products. The laboratory is superior to the forest because  other forms of local anesthetics, such as eucain and novocain, can be  made that are better than the natural alkaloid because more effective  and less poisonous.    I must not forget to mention another lot of coal-tar derivatives in  which some of my readers will take a personal interest. That is the  photographic developers. I am old enough to remember when we used to  develop our plates in ferrous sulfate solution and you never saw nicer  negatives than we got with it. But when pyrogallic acid came in we  switched over to that even though it did stain our fingers and sometimes  our plates. Later came a swarm of new organic reducing agents under  various fancy names, such as metol, hydro (short for hydro-quinone) and  eikongen (\"the image-maker\"). Every fellow fixed up his own formula and  called his fellow-members of the camera club fools for not adopting it  though he secretly hoped they would not.    Under the double stimulus of patriotism and high prices the American  drug and dyestuff industry developed rapidly. In 1917 about as many  pounds of dyes were manufactured in America as were imported in 1913 and  our _exports_ of American-made dyes exceeded in value our _imports_  before the war. In 1914 the output of American dyes was valued at  $2,500,000. In 1917 it amounted to over $57,000,000. This does not mean  that the problem was solved, for the home products were not equal in  variety and sometimes not in quality to those made in Germany. Many  valuable dyes were lacking and the cost was of course much higher.  Whether the American industry can compete with the foreign in an open  market and on equal terms is impossible to say because such conditions  did not prevail before the war and they are not going to prevail in the  future. Formerly the large German cartels through their agents and  branches in this country kept the business in their own hands and now  the American manufacturers are determined to maintain the independence  they have acquired. They will not depend hereafter upon the tariff to  cut off competition but have adopted more effective measures. The 4500  German chemical patents that had been seized by the Alien Property  Custodian were sold by him for $250,000 to the Chemical Foundation, an  association of American manufacturers organized \"for the Americanization  of such institutions as may be affected thereby, for the exclusion or  elimination of alien interests hostile or detrimental to said industries  and for the advancement of chemical and allied science and industry in  the United States.\" The Foundation has a large fighting fund so that it  \"may be able to commence immediately and prosecute with the utmost vigor  infringement proceedings whenever the first German attempt shall  hereafter be made to import into this country.\"    So much mystery has been made of the achievements of German chemists--as  though the Teutonic brain had a special lobe for that faculty, lacking  in other craniums--that I want to quote what Dr. Hesse says about his  first impressions of a German laboratory of industrial research:         Directly after graduating from the University of Chicago in       1896, I entered the employ of the largest coal-tar dye works in       the world at its plant in Germany and indeed in one of its       research laboratories. This was my first trip outside the       United States and it was, of course, an event of the first       magnitude for me to be in Europe, and, as a chemist, to be in       Germany, in a German coal-tar dye plant, and to cap it all in       its research laboratory--a real _sanctum sanctorum_ for       chemists. In a short time the daily routine wore the novelty       off my experience and I then settled down to calm analysis and       dispassionate appraisal of my surroundings and to compare what       was actually before and around me with my expectations. I       found that the general laboratory equipment was no better than       what I had been accustomed to; that my colleagues had no better       fundamental training than I had enjoyed nor any better fact--or       manipulative--equipment than I; that those in charge of the       work had no better general intellectual equipment nor any more       native ability than had my instructors; in short, there was       nothing new about it all, nothing that we did not have back       home, nothing--except the specific problems that were engaging       their attention, and the special opportunities of attacking       them. Those problems were of no higher order"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17160"],[0,"Modern Prose And Poetry; For Secondary Schools (#16)"],[1,"the first step on the new  soil. My father found occasion to instruct or correct us even on the way  from the pier to Wall Street, which journey we made crowded together in  a rickety cab. He told us not to lean out of the windows, not to point,  and explained the word \"greenhorn.\" We did not want to be \"greenhorns,\"  and gave the strictest attention to my father's instructions. I do not  know when my parents found opportunity to review together the history of  Polotzk in the three years past, for we children had no patience with  the subject; my mother's narrative was constantly interrupted by  irrelevant questions, interjections, and explanations.    The first meal was an object lesson of much variety. My father produced  several kinds of food, ready to eat, without any cooking, from little  tin cans that had printing all over them. He attempted to introduce us  to a queer, slippery kind of fruit, which he called \"banana,\" but had to  give it up for the time being. After the meal, he had better luck with a  curious piece of furniture on runners, which he called \"rocking-chair.\"  There were five of us newcomers, and we found five different ways of  getting into the American machine of perpetual motion, and as many ways  of getting out of it. One born and bred to the use of a rocking-chair  cannot imagine how ludicrous people can make themselves when attempting  to use it for the first time. We laughed immoderately over our various  experiments with the novelty, which was a wholesome way of letting off  steam after the unusual excitement of the day.    In our flat we did not think of such a thing as storing the coal in the  bathtub. There was no bathtub. So in the evening of the first day my  father conducted us to the public baths. As we moved along in a little  procession, I was delighted with the illumination of the streets. So  many lamps, and they burned until morning, my father said, and so people  did not need to carry lanterns. In America, then, everything was free,  as we had heard in Russia. Light was free; the streets were as bright as  a synagogue on a holy day. Music was free; we had been serenaded, to our  gaping delight, by a brass band of many pieces, soon after our  installation on Union Place.    Education was free. That subject my father had written about repeatedly,  as comprising his chief hope for us children, the essence of American  opportunity, the treasure that no thief could touch, not even misfortune  or poverty. It was the one thing that he was able to promise us when he  sent for us; surer, safer than bread or shelter. On our second day I was  thrilled with the realization of what this freedom of education meant. A  little girl from across the alley came and offered to conduct us to  school. My father was out, but we five between us had a few words of  English by this time. We knew the word school. We understood. This  child, who had never seen us till yesterday, who could not pronounce our  names, who was not much better dressed than we, was able to offer us the  freedom of the schools of Boston! No application made, no questions  asked, no examinations, rulings, exclusions; no machinations, no fees.  The doors stood open for every one of us. The smallest child could show  us the way.    This incident impressed me more than anything I had heard in advance of  the freedom of education in America. It was a concrete proof--almost the  thing itself. One had to experience it to understand it.    It was a great disappointment to be told by my father that we were not  to enter upon our school career at once. It was too near the end of the  term, he said, and we were going to move to Crescent Beach in a week or  so. We had to wait until the opening of the schools in September. What a  loss of precious time--from May till September!    Not that the time was really lost. Even the interval on Union Place was  crowded with lessons and experiences. We had to visit the stores and be  dressed from head to foot in American clothing; we had to learn the  mysteries of the iron stove, the washboard, and the speaking-tube; we  had to learn to trade with the fruit peddler through the window, and not  to be afraid of the policeman; and, above all, we had to learn English.    The kind people who assisted us in these important matters form a group  by themselves in the gallery of my friends. If I had never seen them  from those early days till now, I should still have remembered them with  gratitude. When I enumerate the long list of American teachers, I must  begin with those who came to us on Wall Street and taught us our first  steps. To my mother, in her perplexity over the cookstove, the woman who  showed her how to make the fire was an angel of deliverance. A fairy  godmother to us children was she who led us to a wonderful country  called \"uptown,\" where in a dazzlingly beautiful palace called a  \"department store,\" we exchanged our hateful homemade European costumes,  which pointed us out as \"greenhorns\" to the children on the street, for  real American machine-made garments, and issued forth glorified in each  other's eyes.    With our despised immigrant clothing we shed also our impossible Hebrew  names. A committee of our friends, several years ahead of us in American  experience, put their heads together and concocted American names for us  all. Those of our real names that had no pleasing American equivalents  they ruthlessly discarded, content if they retained the initials. My  mother, possessing a name that was not easily translatable, was punished  with the undignified nickname of Annie. Fetchke, Joseph, and Deborah  issued as Frieda, Joseph, and Dora, respectively. As for poor me, I was  simply cheated. The name they gave me was hardly new. My Hebrew name  being Maryashe in full, Mashke for short, Russianized into Marya  (_Mar-ya_) my friends said that it would hold good in English as _Mary_;  which was very disappointing, as I longed to possess a strange-sounding  American name like the others.    I am forgetting the consolation I had, in this matter of names, from the  use of my surname, which I have had no occasion to mention until now. I  found on my arrival that my father was \"Mr. Antin\" on the slightest  provocation, and not, as in Polotzk, on state occasions alone. And so I  was \"Mary Antin,\" and I felt very important to answer to such a  dignified title. It was just like America that even plain people should  wear their surnames on week days.    As a family we were so diligent under instruction, so adaptable, and so  clever in hiding our deficiencies, that when we made the journey to  Crescent Beach, in the wake of our small wagon-load of household goods,  my father had very little occasion to admonish us on the way, and I am  sure he was not ashamed of us. So much we had achieved toward our  Americanization during the two weeks since our landing.    Crescent Beach is a name that is printed in very small type on the maps  of the environs of Boston, but a life-size strip of sand curves from  Winthrop to Lynn; and that is historic ground in the annals of my  family. The place is now a popular resort for holiday crowds, and is  famous under the name of Revere Beach. When the reunited Antins made  their stand there, however, there were no boulevards, no stately  bath-houses, no hotels, no gaudy amusement places, no illuminations, no  showmen, no tawdry rabble. There was only the bright clean sweep of  sand, the summer sea, and the summer sky. At high tide the whole  Atlantic rushed in, tossing the seaweeds in his mane; at low tide he  rushed out, growling and gnashing his granite teeth. Between tides a  baby might play on the beach, digging with pebbles and shells, till it  lay asleep on the sand. The whole sun shone by day, troops of stars by  night, and the great moon in its season.    Into this grand cycle of the seaside day I came to live and learn and  play. A few people came with me, as I have already intimated; but the  main thing was that _I_ came to live on the edge of the sea--I, who had  spent my life inland, believing that the great waters of the world were  spread out before me in the Dvina. My idea of the human world had grown  enormously during the long journey; my idea of the earth had expanded  with every day at sea, my idea of the world outside the earth now budded  and swelled during my prolonged experience of the wide and unobstructed  heavens.    Not that I got any inkling of the conception of a multiple world. I had  had no lessons in cosmogony, and I had no spontaneous revelation of the  true position of the earth in the universe. For me, as for my fathers,  the sun set and rose, and I did not feel the earth rushing through  space. But I lay stretched out in the sun, my eyes level with the sea,  till I seemed to be absorbed bodily by the very materials of the world  around me; till I could not feel my hand as separate from the warm sand  in which it was buried. Or I crouched on the beach at full moon,  wondering, wondering, between the two splendors of the sky and the sea.  Or I ran out to meet the incoming storm, my face full in the wind, my  being a-tingle with an awesome delight to the tips of my fog-matted  locks flying behind; and stood clinging to some stake or upturned boat,  shaken by the roar and rumble of the waves. So clinging, I pretended  that I was in danger, and was deliciously frightened; I held on with  both hands, and shook my head, exulting in the tumult around me, equally  ready to laugh or sob. Or else I sat, on the stillest days, with my back  to the sea, not looking at all, but just listening to the rustle of the  waves on the sand; not thinking at all, but just breathing with the sea.    Thus courting the influence of sea and sky and variable weather, I was  bound to have dreams, hints, imaginings. It was no more than this,  perhaps: that the world as I knew it was not large enough to contain  all that I saw and felt; that the"]]]
