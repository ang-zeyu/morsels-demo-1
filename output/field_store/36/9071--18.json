Nevertheless, three points were indisputable: Myrick had been caught  spying; in his possession was a can of explosive which could be set off  by concussion; and it was a fact that to Myrick had been first  entrusted the matter of hunting for Andy O'Malley when Tom had put the  search for the Westerner up to the Blatz people.    \"He played traitor both to you, Mr. Swift, and to our agency,\" declared  Blatz to Tom. \"I wash my hands of him. I hope the police send him away  for life!\"    \"He'll go to prison all right,\" said Tom, confidently. \"But the main  point is that one of your operatives fell down on a simple job. I  wanted that Andy O'Malley traced. He's out of the way, now, of course.  If you had put an honest man to work for me, O'Malley would be behind  the bars himself.\"    \"Some doubt of that, Mr. Swift,\" grumbled Blatz.    \"Why?\"    \"Where's your evidence that this O'Malley was connected with the  attempt to blow up your locomotive the first time? Mr. Newton's  testimony would need corroboration.\"    \"Never mind that,\" rejoined the young inventor, with a smile.  \"I'd  have him for highway robbery. I recognized him. He robbed me of a  wallet. Guess we could put O'Malley away for awhile on that charge. And  by the time he got out again my job for that Western railroad would be  completed.\"    \"Humph! Nothing personal in your going after the fellow, then?\" queried  the head of the detective agency.    \"No. But I frankly confess that I am afraid of O'Malley. He is  undoubtedly in the employ of men who will pay him well if he wrecks my  invention. But there really is no personal grudge between O'Malley and  me. At least, I feel no particular enmity against the fellow.\"    There was a pause.    \"If you say so we will give you a couple of good men as bodyguards on  your trip West,\" suggested Blatz, licking his lips hungrily.    \"As good men as Myrick?\" retorted Tom, rather scornfully. \"No, thank  you. Just make your bill out to the Swift Construction Company to date,  and a check will be sent you the first of the month. I will take my own  precautions hereafter.\"    And those precautions Tom considered sufficient. When the Hercules 0001  was towed out of the enclosure belonging to the Swift Construction  Company early on Monday morning, each door and window of the huge cab  was barred and locked. Inside the cab rode Koku, the giant.    Koku had his orders to allow nobody to enter the Hercules 0001 until  Tom or Ned Newton came to relieve him of his responsibility as guard.  The giant had a swinging cot to sleep on and sufficient food--of a  kind--to last him for a fortnight if necessary.    He was not armed, for Tom did not often trust him with weapons.  The  young inventor, however, did not expect that any armed force would  attack the electric locomotive.    If Montagne Lewis desired to wreck the new invention which might mean  so much to Mr. Bartholomew and the H. & P. A., he surely would not  allow his hirelings to attack openly the locomotive while it was en  route.    On the other hand, Tom did not really believe that Andy O'Malley would  attempt any reprisal against him personally. Of course, the Western  desperado might feel himself abused by Tom, especially in the matter of  Tom's use of his ammonia pistol.    But that had happened months ago. O'Malley had undoubtedly been hired  by Mr. Bartholomew's enemies to obtain knowledge of the contract signed  between the young inventor and the railroad president; and later it was  certain that the spy had tried his best to wreck the electric  locomotive.    As for any personal assault so many weeks after O'Malley had clashed  with him Tom Swift did not expect it. With Ned in his company on this  journey to Hendrickton, the young inventor had good reason to consider  that he was perfectly safe.    Mary Nestor and Mr. Swift came to the station to see the two young men  off on Monday evening. Mary had heard about the second attempt made to  blow up the Hercules 0001 and she begged Tom to take every precaution  while he was in the West.    \"You will be in the enemy's country out there, Tom dear,\" she warned  him. \"You won't be careless?\"    \"I know I shall be mighty busy,\" he told her, laughing. \"I'll let Ned  play watch-dog. And you know, his is a cautious soul, Mary.\"    \"I've every confidence in Ned's faithfulness,\" the girl said, still  with anxious tone. \"But those men who are trying to ruin Mr.  Bartholomew's road will stop at nothing. I must hear from you  frequently, Tom, or I shall worry myself ill.\"    \"Don't lose your courage, Mary,\" rejoined the inventor, more gravely.  \"I do not think they will attack me personally again.  Remember that  Koku is on the job, as well as Ned. And Mr. Damon declares he will  follow us West very shortly,\" and again Tom chuckled.    \"Even Mr. Damon may be a help to you, Tom,\" declared Mary, warmly. \"At  least, he is completely devoted to you.\"    \"So is Rad Sampson,\" said Tom, with a little grimace. \"I certainly had  my hands full convincing him that father needed him here at home. At  that, Rad is pretty warm over the fact that I sent Koku on with the  locomotive. If anything should chance to happen to my invention,  Eradicate Sampson is going to shout 'I told you so!' all over the shop.\"    Mary dabbed her eyes a little with her handkerchief, and Tom patted her  shoulder.    \"Don't worry, Mary,\" he said more cheerfully. \"There won't a thing  happen to me out there at Hendrickton. I'll keep the wires hot with  telegrams. And I'll write to both you and father, and give you the full  particulars of how we get along. You'll keep your eye on father, Mary,  won't you?\"    \"You may be sure of that,\" said the girl. \"I will not leave him  entirely to the care of Rad,\" and she tried hard to smile again.  But  it was a difficult matter.    Such a parting as this is always hard to endure. Tom wrung his father's  hand and warned him to be careful of his health. The train came along  and the two young men boarded it with their personal luggage.    They had a flash of the two faces--that of Mr. Swift's and Mary's  blooming countenance--as the express started again, and then the  outlook from the Pullman coach showed them the fast-receding environs  of Shopton.    \"We're on our way, my boy,\" said Tom to his chum.    \"We certainly are,\" said Ned, thoughtfully. \"I wonder what the outcome  of the trip will be? It may not be all plain sailing.\"    \"Don't croak,\" rejoined the young inventor, with a grin.    \"I don't see how you can appear so cheerful. Why! you don't even know  if that electric locomotive is safe. Something may have already  happened to it. The freight train might be wrecked. A dozen things  might happen.\"    \"I am not crossing any bridges before I come to them,\" declared Tom.  \"Besides, I propose to keep in touch with the Hercules Three-Oughts-One  in a certain way--Hullo! Here it is.\"    \"Here what is?\" demanded Ned.    The Pullman conductor at that moment came in through the forward  corridor. He had a telegram in his hand, and intoned loudly as he  approached:    \"Mr. Swift! Mr. Thomas Swift! Telegram for Mr. Swift.\"    \"That is for me, Conductor,\" said Tom briskly, offering his card.    \"All right, Mr. Swift. Just got it at Shopton. Operator said you had  boarded my car. This is railroad business, you'll notice.  Have you any  reply, sir?\"    Tom ripped open the envelope and unfolded the telegram. He held it so  that Ned could read, too. It was signed: \"N. G. Smith, Conductor,  Number 48.\"    \"What's that?\" exclaimed Ned, reading the message.    \"'Locomotive and crazy man in it all right at Lingo,'\" repeated Tom  aloud, and chuckled.    \"No, Conductor, there is no answer.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed Ned. \"You arranged to get reports en route from the  conductors handling the Hercules Three-Oughts-One?\"    \"Surest thing you know,\" replied Tom. \"And I guess, from the wording of  this message, that the crew of Forty-eight have already found out that  Koku is not an ordinary guard.\"    \"He's a great boy,\" smiled Ned. \"Glad he is on the job.\"          Chapter XVII    The Wreck of Forty-Eight      The two chums sought their berths that night in high fettle.  Even Ned  sloughed off his mood of apprehension which he had worn on boarding the  train at Shopton.    For, true to the arrangement Tom had made with the railroad people,  another reassuring telegram was brought to him before bedtime. The  second conductor responsible for the management of the Western bound  freight to which the Hercules 0001 was attached, sent back a brief  statement of the safety of the electric locomotive.    Naturally the two chums would have passed the freight and got well  ahead of it before reaching Hendrickton. But Tom had business in  Chicago, and they stayed over in that city for twenty-four hours. The  freight train went around the city, of course. But the telegrams  continued to reach Tom promptly, even at the hotel where he and Ned  stopped in the city.    Occasionally the trainmen in charge of the freight mentioned Koku. His  eccentric behavior doubtless somewhat puzzled the railroaders.    \"That's all right,\" chuckled Ned. \"Let them think Koku is dangerous if  they want to. That O'Malley person believed he was!\"    \"I'll say so!\" replied Tom. \"The way he ran when Koku started after him  that time on the Waterfield Road seemed to prove that he didn't want to  mix with Koku.\"    \"If he--or other spies--learns that Koku is with the Hercules  Three-Oughts-One, it ought to warn them away from the locomotive.\"    This was Ned's final speech before getting into his berth. He, as well  as Tom, slept quite as calmly on this first night out of Chicago as  they had before.    They knew exactly where the electric"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13640"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 821, September 26, 1891 (#16)"],[1,"in the mercantile marine,[3] Mr. William Boyd  discussed this question at some length, and proposed to attain the end  of reducing the weight of machinery by the legitimate method of  augmenting the speed of revolution and so developing the required power  with smaller engines. This method, while promising, is limited by the  efficiency of the screw, but may be adopted with advantage so long as  the increase in speed of revolution involves no such change in the screw  as to reduce its efficiency as a propeller. But when the point is  reached beyond which a further change involves loss of propelling  efficiency, it is time to stop; and the writer ventures to say that in  many cargo vessels now at work the limit has been reached, while in many  others it has certainly been passed.    [Footnote 3: Transactions Northeast Coast Institution of Engineers and  Shipbuilders, vol. 6, 1889-90, p. 253.]    _Economy of Fuel_.--Coming to the highly important question of economy  of fuel, the average consumption of coal per indicated horse-power is  1.522 lb. per hour. The average working pressure is 158.5 lb. per square  inch. Comparing this working pressure with 77.4 lb. in 1881, a superior  economy of 19 per cent. might be expected now, on account of the higher  pressure, or taking the 1.828 lb. of coal per hour per indicated  horse-power in 1881, the present performance under similar conditions  should be 1.48 lb. per hour per indicated horse-power. It appears that  the working pressures have been increased twice in the last ten years,  and nearly three times in the last nineteen. The coal consumptions have  been reduced 16.7 per cent. in the last ten years and 27.9 per cent. in  the last nineteen. The revolutions per minute have increased in the  ratios of 100, 105, 114; and the piston speeds as 100, 124, 140.  Although it is quite possible that the further investigations of the  Research Committee on Marine Engine Trials may show that the present  actual consumption of coal per indicated horse-power is understated, yet  it is hardly probable that the relative results will be affected  thereby.    _Dimensions_.--In the matter of the power put into individual vessels,  considerable strides have been made. In 1881, probably the greatest  power which has been put into one vessel was in the case of the Arizona,  whose machinery indicated about 6,360 horse-power. The following table  gives an idea of the dimensions and power of the larger machinery in the  later passenger vessels:    TABLE III.--DIMENSIONS AND POWER OF MACHINERY IN LATER PASSENGER  VESSELS.    -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+       |                |                       |Length |           |  Year.| Name of vessel.|     Diameters of      |  of   |Indicated  |       |                |      cylinders.       |Stroke.|horsepower.|  -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+       |                |        Inches.        |Inches.|           |  1881 |Alaska          |     68, 100, 100      |  72   |   10,686  |  -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+  1881 |City of Rome    | 46, 86; 46, 86; 46, 86|  72   |   11,800  |  -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+  1881 |Servia          |     72, 100, 100      |  78   |   10,300  |  -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+  1881 |Livadia yacht   |  60, 78, 78; 60, 78, \\|  39   |   12,500  |       |                |    78; 60, 78, 78    /|       |           |  -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+  1883 |Oregon          |     70, 104, 104      |  72   |   13,300  |  -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+  1884 |Umbria          |\\    71, 105, 105      |  72   |   14,320  |  1884 |Etruria         |/                      |       |           |  -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+  1888 |City of New York|\\    45, 71, 113;     \\|  60   |   20,000  |  1889 |City of Paris   |/    45, 71, 113      /|       |    about  |  -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+  1889 |Majestic        |\\    43, 68, 110;     \\|  60   |   18,000  |  1889 |Teutonic        |/    43, 68, 110      /|       |           |  -----+----------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------+    In war vessels the increase has been equally marked. In 1881 the maximum  power seems to have been in the Inflexible, namely, 8,485 indicated  horse-power. The following will give an idea of the recent advance made:  Howe (Admiral class), 11,600 indicated horse-power; Italia and Lepanto,  19,000 indicated horse-power; Re Umberto, 19,000 indicated horse-power;  Blake and Blenheim (building), 18,000 indicated horse-power; Sardegna  (building), 22,800 indicated horse-power. It is thus evident that there  are vessels at work to-day having about three times the maximum power of  any before 1881.    _General Conclusions_.--The progress made during the last ten years  having been sketched out, however roughly, the general conclusions may  be stated briefly as follows: First, the working pressure has been about  doubled. Second, the increase of working pressure and other improvements  have brought with them their equivalent in economy of coal, which is  about 20 per cent. Third, marked progress has been made in the direction  of dimension, more than twice the power having been put into individual  vessels. Fourth, substantial advance has been made in the scientific  principles of engineering. It only remains for the writer to thank the  various friends who have so kindly furnished him with data for some of  the tables which have been given; and to express the hope that the next  ten years may be marked by such progress as has been witnessed in the  past. But it must be remembered that, if future progress be equal in  merit or ratio, it may well be less in quantity, because advance becomes  more difficult of achievement as perfection is more nearly approached.           *       *       *       *       *          THE LITTLE HOUSE.    BY M.M.      One of the highest medical authorities is credited with the statement  that \"nine-tenths of the diseases that afflict humanity are caused by  neglect to answer the calls of Nature.\"    This state of affairs is generally admitted, but is usually attributed  to individual indolence. That, doubtless, has a great deal to do with  it, but should not part of the blame be laid upon the often unpleasant  environments, which make us shrink as from the performance of a painful  duty?    In social life, unless from absolute necessity or charity, people of  refined habits do not call on those whose surroundings shock their sense  of decency; but when they go to pay the calls of Nature, they are often  compelled to visit her in the meanest and most offensive of abodes;  built for her by men's hands; for Nature herself makes no such mistakes  in conducting her operations. She does not always surround herself with  the pomp and pride of life, but she invariably hedges herself in with  the thousand decencies and the pomp of privacy.    But what do we often do? We build what is sometimes aptly termed \"an  out-house,\" because it is placed so that the delicate minded among its  frequenters may be made keenly alive to the fact that they can be  plainly seen by every passer-by and by every idle neighbor on the  lookout. This tiny building is seldom weatherproof; In consequence, keen  cold winds from above, below, and all around find ready entrance, chill  the uncovered person, frequently check the motions, and make the strong  as well as the weak, the young as well as the old, very sorry indeed  that they are so often uselessly obliged to answer the calls of Nature.  It is true, the floor is sometimes carpeted with snow, but the feet feel  that to be but cold comfort, though the door may enjoy rattling its  broken hasp and creaking its loose hinges.    How often, too, are the nose and the eye offended by disregard of the  Mosaic injunction, found in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth  verses of the twenty-third chapter of Deuteronomy! Of course this  injunction was addressed to a people who had been debased by slavery,  but who were being trained to fit them for their high calling as the  chosen of God; but is not some such sanitary regulation needed in these  times, when a natural office is often made so offensive to us by its  environments that it is difficult for us to believe that \"God made man a  little lower than the angels,\" or that the human body is the temple of  the Holy Ghost?    Dwellers in the aristocratic regions of a well drained city, whose  wealth enables them to surround themselves with all devices tending to a  refined seclusion, may doubt all this, but sanitary inspectors who have  made a round of domiciliary visits in the suburbs, or the older,  neglected parts of a large city, of to any part of a country town or  village, will readily affirm as to its general truth.    This unpardonable neglect of one of the minor decencies by the mass of  the people seems to be caused partly by a feeling of false shame, and  partly by an idea that it is expensive and troublesome to make any  change that will improve their sanitary condition or dignify their daily  lives.    The Rev. Henry Moule, of Fordington Vicarage, Dorsetshire, England, was  one of the first to turn his attention to this matter. With the  threefold object of improving the sanitary condition of his people,  refining their habits, and enriching their gardens, he invented what he  called the \"dry earth closet.\"    \"It is based on the power of clay and the decomposed organic matter  found in the soil to absorb and retain all offensive odors and all  fertilizing matters; and it consists, essentially, of a mechanical  contrivance (attached to the ordinary seat) for measuring out and  discharging into the vault or"]]]
