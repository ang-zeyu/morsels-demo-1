At this time many spears were thrown, and some blows were  inflicted with clubs; but no serious mischief ensued. On the death of  Cole-be, all seemed determined; for the man whose life he had in so  cowardly a manner taken away was much beloved by his countrymen.    With this design, a number of natives assembled a few days afterwards  before the barracks, breathing revenge; at which time a young man, a  relation to the object of their vengeance, received so many wounds, that  he was nearly killed; and a lad, who was also related to him  (Nan-bar-ray, the same who formerly lived with Mr. White, the principal  surgeon), was to have been sacrificed; but he was saved for the present  by the appearance of a soldier, who had been sent to the place with him  for his protection; and it was thought that when the present tumult  against his uncle (for Cole-be was the brother of this boy's father) had  subsided, nothing more would be thought of him.    Cole-be, finding that he must either submit to the trial usual on such  occasions, or live in the continual apprehension of being taken off by a  midnight murder and a single hand, determined to come forward, and suffer  the business to be decided one way or the other. Having signified his  resolution, a day was appointed, and he repaired armed to the place of  rendezvous. The rage and violence shown by the friends of the deceased  were indescribable; and Cole-be would certainly have expiated his offence  with his life, but for the interference of several of the military,  before whose barrack the affair took place. Although active, and  extremely _au fait_ in the use of the shield, he was overpowered, and,  falling beneath their spears, would certainly have been killed on the  spot, but several soldiers rushed in, and prevented their putting him to  death where he lay; he himself, from the many severe wounds which he had  received, being wholly incapable of making any resistance. His friends,  the soldiers, lifted him from the ground, and between them bore him into  the barracks.    Bennillong, the particular friend and companion of Cole-be, was present  at this meeting; but, it was supposed, without intending to take any part  in it either way. The atrocity of his friend's conduct had been such that  he could not openly espouse his quarrel; perhaps he had no stomach to the  fight; and certainly, if he could avoid it, he would not, by appearing  against him, add to the number of his enemies. He was armed, however, and  unencumbered with clothing of any kind, and remained a silent spectator  of the tumultuous scene, until the moment when the soldiers rushed in to  save the life of Cole-be. His conduct here became inexplicable. On a  sudden, he chose to be in a rage at something or other, and threw a spear  among the soldiers, which dreadfully took effect on one of them, entering  at his back and coming out at the belly, close to the navel. For this he  would instantly have been killed on the spot, had not Mr. Smith, the  provost-marshal, interfered and brought him away, boiling with the most  savage rage; for he had received a blow on the head with the butt-end of  a musket.    It became necessary to confine him during the night, as well to prevent  the mischief with which he threatened the white people, as to save him  from the anger of the military, and on the following morning he quitted  the town.    This man, instead of making himself useful, or showing the least  gratitude for the attentions which he received from every one, had become  a most insolent and troublesome savage. As it was impossible sometimes to  avoid censuring him for his conduct, he had been known to walk about  armed, and heard to declare it was for the express purpose of spearing  the governor whenever he saw him. This last outrage of his had rendered  him more hateful than any of his countrymen; and, as the natives who had  so constantly resided and received so many comforts in the settlement  were now afraid to appear in the town, believing that, like themselves,  we should punish all for the misconduct of one, it might rather be  expected that Bennillong could not be far from meeting that punishment  which he certainly provoked and merited.    During the time that Ye-ra-ni-be was alive, the attendance of the natives  who were then in the town was called to the performance of the ceremony  named Yoo-lahng Era-ba-diang, the particulars of which have been  described in the preceding* part of this account. The place of meeting at  this time was in the middle harbour; and the various exhibitions which  took place were not observed to differ from those of the preceding years.  The season of the year was the same, but not precisely the month, which  confirmed the conjecture of their not being influenced by any particular  motive in the choice of the month of February for the celebration of this  curious and peculiar ceremony.    [* Vide Appendix to Vol I.]    Bennillong, who assisted at it, returned without his wife, the lady  having been without much difficulty persuaded by her mother, whom she  accidentally met at the Yoo-lahng, to leave her husband, and return with  her to the place of her residence. Bennillong, notwithstanding the  European polish which he could at times assume, was by no means a  favourite with, or held in much estimation by the females of his own  complexion. If any unfortunate girl was seen to be in his train for any  time, she was well known to be actuated less by inclination than by the  fear of his exercising that right which the stronger always claimed the  privilege of possessing over the weaker sex.    The business of the settlement now reclaims our notice.    Some time in this month the house of John Mitcham, a settler in the  district of Concord, was attacked by three villains, and set on fire,  together with a stack of wheat, which he had just completed and secured  against the weather. This unfortunate man was indebted about L33 which  the contents of his wheat-stack would have paid off, but now, besides  being very much beaten, he had the world to begin again, with a load of  debt which this untoward accident would much increase. The man himself  knew not to what cause to attribute it; and he was as ignorant who were  his enemies; for two of them had blackened their faces, and to the third  he was a stranger.    On its being represented to the governor, he gave information of the  mischief in the public orders; and at the same time called upon every man  who valued the safety of his person, and the security of his property, to  use the utmost vigilance in discovering and bringing to justice these  daring offenders, that the law might have an opportunity of showing its  ability to defend the property of every inhabitant of the colony, by the  punishment of those who dared to attack it. He also observed, as a  further inducement, that the inhabitants could not fail to see the danger  of suffering evils of this kind to pass unnoticed; as the most ignorant  must know, that every reduction in the quantity of wheat must be attended  with a reduction in the weekly ration; a circumstance by which every man,  whether on or off the public store, was affected. The Order concluded  with an offer of conditional freedom, and permission to become a settler,  to any person, who, being a convict, would come forward and give such  information as might serve to convict the offenders before a court of  criminal judicature.    Dogs had increased to such an extent as to occasion their becoming the  object of a public order, restricting the number kept by each person to  no more than were absolutely necessary for the protection of his house  and premises. Much mischief had been done by them among the hogs, sheep,  goats, and fowls of individuals.    There were at this time in the town of Sydney three schools for the  education of children; and this being the period of their breaking-up for  the Christmas holidays, the governor was gratified with the sight of 102  clean and decently dressed children, who came with their several masters  and mistresses, and in form paid their respects to his excellency, who  examined the progress of the elder scholars in writing, specimens of  which he kept for the purpose of comparing with those which they should  present to him on the following Christmas.    One moment's reflection on the vices that prevailed in the colony will be  sufficient to excite a wish, that some institution could have been  devised for separating the greater part of these (at present, innocent)  members of the community from their vicious parents, where they could  have been educated at the public expense, their propensities to evil  corrected, and that turn given to their attainments which should secure  them a stock of useful knowledge. An arrangement of this nature was every  day becoming more necessary; for there were not less than 300 young  people at this time in the town of Sydney, none of whom, with the  exception of a very few, had been born in England.    On the eve of Christmas Day two young men, settlers on some land midway  between Sydney and Parramatta, having been boasting of their respective  abilities in drinking, regardless of the solemnity of the time,  challenged each other to a trial of their skill; on which they were so  deliberately bent, that, to prevent their being interrupted, they retired  to the skirts of a neighbouring wood, with a quantity of raw spirits  which they had provided for the purpose. Their abilities, however, were  not equal to their boasting; for one of them died upon the spot, and the  life of the other was fast ebbing when he was taken up. Had another hour  elapsed, he too must have perished, like his wretched companion. They had  not been able to finish all the pernicious spirit which they had  prepared, some of it remaining by them in a case bottle "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1268"],[0,"The Mysterious Island (#16)"],[1,"   And he showed the apparatus which served for a burning-glass. It was  simply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter's  watches. Having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive  by means of a little clay, he thus fabricated a regular burning-glass,  which, concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss, soon caused  it to blaze.    The sailor considered the apparatus; then he gazed at the engineer  without saying a word, only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if  Cyrus Harding was not a magician, he was certainly no ordinary man. At  last speech returned to him, and he cried,--    \"Note that, Mr. Spilett, note that down on your paper!\"    \"It is noted,\" replied the reporter.    Then, Neb helping him, the seaman arranged the spit, and the capybara,  properly cleaned, was soon roasting like a suckling-pig before a clear,  crackling fire.    The Chimneys had again become more habitable, not only because the  passages were warmed by the fire, but because the partitions of wood and  mud had been re-established.    It was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed their  day well. Cyrus Harding had almost entirely recovered his strength, and  had proved it by climbing to the upper plateau. From this point his eye,  accustomed to estimate heights and distances, was fixed for a long time  on the cone, the summit of which he wished to reach the next day. The  mountain, situated about six miles to the northwest, appeared to him to  measure 3,500 feet above the level of the sea. Consequently the gaze of  an observer posted on its summit would extend over a radius of at least  fifty miles. Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve  the question of \"island or continent,\" to which he attached so much  importance.    They supped capitally. The flesh of the capybara was declared excellent.  The sargassum and the almonds of the stone-pine completed the repast,  during which the engineer spoke little. He was preoccupied with projects  for the next day.    Once or twice Pencroft gave forth some ideas upon what it would be best  to do; but Cyrus Harding, who was evidently of a methodical mind, only  shook his head without uttering a word.    \"To-morrow,\" he repeated, \"we shall know what we have to depend upon,  and we will act accordingly.\"    The meal ended, fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire, and  the inhabitants of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top, were soon  buried in a deep sleep.    No incident disturbed this peaceful night, and the next day, the 29th  of March, fresh and active they awoke, ready to undertake the excursion  which must determine their fate.    All was ready for the start. The remains of the capybara would be enough  to sustain Harding and his companions for at least twenty-four hours.    Besides, they hoped to find more food on the way. As the glasses had  been returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter, Pencroft  burned a little linen to serve as tinder. As to flint, that would not be  wanting in these regions of Plutonic origin. It was half-past seven in  the morning when the explorers, armed with sticks, left the Chimneys.  Following Pencroft's advice, it appeared best to take the road already  traversed through the forest, and to return by another route. It was  also the most direct way to reach the mountain. They turned the south  angle and followed the left bank of the river, which was abandoned at  the point where it formed an elbow towards the southwest. The path,  already trodden under the evergreen trees, was found, and at nine  o'clock Cyrus Harding and his companions had reached the western border  of the forest. The ground, till then, very little undulated, boggy at  first, dry and sandy afterwards, had a gentle slope, which ascended from  the shore towards the interior of the country. A few very timid animals  were seen under the forest-trees. Top quickly started them, but his  master soon called him back, for the time had not come to commence  hunting; that would be attended to later. The engineer was not a man who  would allow himself to be diverted from his fixed idea. It might even  have been said that he did not observe the country at all, either in  its configuration or in its natural productions, his great aim being  to climb the mountain before him, and therefore straight towards it he  went. At ten o'clock a halt of a few minutes was made. On leaving  the forest, the mountain system of the country appeared before the  explorers. The mountain was composed of two cones; the first, truncated  at a height of about two thousand five hundred feet, was sustained by  buttresses, which appeared to branch out like the talons of an immense  claw set on the ground. Between these were narrow valleys, bristling  with trees, the last clumps of which rose to the top of the lowest cone.  There appeared to be less vegetation on that side of the mountain which  was exposed to the northeast, and deep fissures could be seen which, no  doubt, were watercourses.    On the first cone rested a second, slightly rounded, and placed a little  on one side, like a great round hat cocked over the ear. A Scotchman  would have said, \"His bonnet was a thocht ajee.\" It appeared formed of  bare earth, here and there pierced by reddish rocks.    They wished to reach the second cone, and proceeding along the ridge of  the spurs seemed to be the best way by which to gain it.    \"We are on volcanic ground,\" Cyrus Harding had said, and his companions  following him began to ascend by degrees on the back of a spur, which,  by a winding and consequently more accessible path, joined the first  plateau.    The ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force. Here and  there stray blocks, numerous debris of basalt and pumice-stone, were met  with. In isolated groups rose fir-trees, which, some hundred feet  lower, at the bottom of the narrow gorges, formed massive shades almost  impenetrable to the sun's rays.    During the first part of the ascent, Herbert remarked on the footprints  which indicated the recent passage of large animals.    \"Perhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly,\" said Pencroft.    \"Well,\" replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger in  India, and the lion in Africa, \"we shall soon learn how successfully to  encounter them. But in the meantime we must be upon our guard!\"    They ascended but slowly.    The distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not be  surmounted directly, was long. Sometimes, too, the ground suddenly fell,  and they found themselves on the edge of a deep chasm which they had to  go round. Thus, in retracing their steps so as to find some practicable  path, much time was employed and fatigue undergone for nothing. At  twelve o'clock, when the small band of adventurers halted for breakfast  at the foot of a large group of firs, near a little stream which fell in  cascades, they found themselves still half way from the first plateau,  which most probably they would not reach till nightfall. From this  point the view of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high  promontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it. On  the left, the sight extended several miles to the north; but, on the  northwest, at the point occupied by the explorers, it was cut short  by the ridge of a fantastically-shaped spur, which formed a powerful  support of the central cone.    At one o'clock the ascent was continued. They slanted more towards the  southwest and again entered among thick bushes. There under the shade  of the trees fluttered several couples of gallinaceae belonging to the  pheasant species. They were tragopans, ornamented by a pendant skin  which hangs over their throats, and by two small, round horns, planted  behind the eyes. Among these birds, which were about the size of a fowl,  the female was uniformly brown, while the male was gorgeous in his  red plumage, decorated with white spots. Gideon Spilett, with a stone  cleverly and vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which  Pencroft, made hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes.    After leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by resting on  each other's shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep  acclivity and reached a level place, with very few trees, where the soil  appeared volcanic. It was necessary to ascend by zigzags to make  the slope more easy, for it was very steep, and the footing being  exceedingly precarious required the greatest caution. Neb and Herbert  took the lead, Pencroft the rear, the captain and the reporter between  them. The animals which frequented these heights--and there were  numerous traces of them--must necessarily belong to those races of sure  foot and supple spine, chamois or goat. Several were seen, but this  was not the name Pencroft gave them, for all of a sudden--\"Sheep!\" he  shouted.    All stopped about fifty feet from half-a-dozen animals of a large size,  with strong horns bent back and flattened towards the point, with a  woolly fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a tawny color.    They were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the  mountainous regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave the  name of the musmon.    \"Have they legs and chops?\" asked the sailor.    \"Yes,\" replied Herbert.    \"Well, then, they are sheep!\" said Pencroft.    The animals, motionless among the blocks of basalt, gazed with an  astonished eye, as if they saw human bipeds for the first time. Then  their fears suddenly aroused, they disappeared, bounding over the rocks.    \"Good-bye, till we meet again,\" cried Pencroft, as he watched them, in  such a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb  could not help laughing.    The ascent was continued. Here and there were traces of lava. Sulphur  springs sometimes stopped their way, and they had to go round them. "]]]
