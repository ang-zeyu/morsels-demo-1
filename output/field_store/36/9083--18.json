These presidios were at San Diego, Monterey,  San Francisco, and Santa Barbara. Each was supposed to have its own  church or chapel, and the original intention was that each should  likewise have its own resident priest. For purposes of economy, however,  this was not done, and the Mission padres were called upon for this  service, though it was often a source of disagreement between the  military and the missionaries. While the Monterey church that occupied  the site of the present structure may, in the first instance, have been  used by Serra for the Mission, it was later used as the church for the  soldiers, and thus became the presidio chapel. I have been unable to  learn when it was built but about fifty years ago Governor Pacheco  donated the funds for its enlargement. The original building was  extended back a number of feet, and an addition made, which makes the  church of cruciform shape, the original building being the long arm of  the cross. The walls are built of sandstone rudely quarried at the rear  of the church. It is now the parish church of Monterey.    Here are a large number of interesting relics and memorials of Serra and  the early Mission days. The chief of these is a reliquary case, made by  an Indian at San Carlos to hold certain valuable relics which Serra  highly prized. Some of these are bones from the Catacombs, and an Agnus  Dei of wax. Serra himself wrote the list of contents on a slip of paper,  which is still intact on the back of the case. This reliquary used to be  carried in procession by Serra on each fourth of November, and is now  used by Father Mestris in like ceremonials.    [Illustration: PRESIDIO CHURCH AND PRIEST'S RESIDENCE, MONTEREY, CALIF.]    [Illustration: MISSION SAN CARLOS.]    [Illustration: MISSION SAN ANTONIO DE PADUA.]    [Illustration: PRESIDIO CHURCH, MONTEREY.]    In the altar space or sanctuary are five chairs, undoubtedly brought to  California by one of the Philippine galleons from one of those islands,  or from China. The bodies are of teak, ebony, or ironwood, with seats of  marble, and with a disk of marble in the back.    In the sacristy is the safe in which Serra used to keep the sacred  vessels, as well as the important papers connected with his office. It  is an interesting object, sheeted with iron, wrapped around with iron  bands and covered all over with bosses. It is about three feet wide and  four feet high. In the drawers close by are several of the copes,  stoles, maniples, and other vestments which were once used by Serra at  the old Mission.        CHAPTER XII    SAN ANTONIO DE PADUA    The third Mission of the series was founded in honor of San Antonio de  Padua, July 14, 1771, by Serra, accompanied by Padres Pieras and Sitjar.  One solitary Indian heard the dedicatory mass, but Serra's enthusiasm  knew no bounds. He was assured that this \"first fruit of the wilderness\"  would go forth and bring many of his companions to the priests.  Immediately after the mass he hastened to the Indian, lavished much  attention on him, and gave him gifts. That same day many other Indians  came and clearly indicated a desire to stay with such pleasant company.  They brought pine-nuts and acorns, and the padres gave them in exchange  strings of glass beads of various colors.    At once buildings were begun, in which work the Indians engaged with  energy, and soon church and dwellings, surrounded by a palisade, were  completed. From the first the Indians manifested confidence in the  padres, and the fifteen days that Padre Serra remained were days of  intense joy and gladness at seeing the readiness of natives to associate  with him and his brother priests. Without delay they began to learn the  language of the Indians, and when they had made sufficient progress they  devoted much time to catechising them. In two years 158 natives were  baptized and enrolled, and instead of relying upon the missionaries for  food, they brought in large quantities of acorns, pine-nuts, squirrels,  and rabbits. The Mission being located in the heart of the mountains,  where pine and oak trees grew luxuriantly, the pine-nut and acorn were  abundant. Before the end of 1773 the church and dwellings were all  built, of adobe, and three soldiers, who had married native women, were  living in separate houses.    In August of 1774 occurred the first trouble. The gentile Indians,  angered at the progress of the Mission and the gathering in of so many  of their people, attacked the Mission and wounded an Indian about to be  baptized. When the news reached Rivera at Monterey, he sent a squad of  soldiers, who captured the culprits, gave them a flogging, and  imprisoned them. Later they were flogged again, and, after a few days in  the stocks, they were released.    In 1779 an alcalde and regidore were chosen from the natives to assist  in the administration of justice. In 1800 the report shows that the  neophyte population was 1118, with 767 baptisms and 656 deaths. The  cattle and horses had decreased from 2232 of the last report to 2217,  but small stock had slightly increased. In 1787 the church was regarded  as the best in California, though it was much improved later, for in  1797 it is stated that it was of adobes with a tiled roof. In 1793 the  large adobe block, eighty varas long and one vara wide, was constructed  for friars' houses, church and storehouse, and it was doubtless this  church that was tiled four years later.    In 1805 it gained its highest population, there being 1296 Indians under  its control. The lands of the Mission were found to be barren,  necessitating frequent changes in cultivated fields and stock ranges.    In 1808 the venerable Buenaventura Sitjar, one of the founders of the  Mission, and who had toiled there continuously for thirty-seven years,  passed to his reward, and was buried in sight of the hills he had loved  so long. The following year, or in 1810, work was begun on a newer and  larger church of adobes, and this is doubtless the building whose ruins  now remain. Though we have no record of its dedication, there is no  question but that it took place prior to 1820, and in 1830 references  are made to its arched corridors, etc., built of brick. Robinson, who  visited it in this year, says the whole Mission is built of brick, but  in this he is in error. The _fachada_ is of brick, but the main part of  the building is of adobe. Robinson speaks thus of the Mission and its  friar: \"Padre Pedro Cabot, the present missionary director, I found to  be a fine, noble-looking man, whose manner and whole deportment would  have led one to suppose he had been bred in the courts of Europe,  rather than in the cloister. Everything was in the most perfect order:  the Indians cleanly and well dressed, the apartments tidy, the  workshops, granaries, and storehouses comfortable and in good keeping.\"    [Illustration: RUINS Of MISSION SAN ANTONIO DE PADUA.]    [Illustration: DUTTON HOTEL, JOLON. On the old stage route between San  Francisco and Los Angeles, near Mission San Antonio de Padua.]    [Illustration: RUINED CORRIDORS AT SAN ANTONIO DE PADUA.]    In 1834 Cabot retired to give place to Padre Jesus Maria Vasquez del  Mercado, one of the newly arrived Franciscans from Zacatecas. In this  year the neophyte population had dwindled to 567, and five years later  Visitador Hartwell found only 270 living at the Mission and its  adjoining ranches. It is possible, however, that there were fully as  many more living at a distance of whom he gained no knowledge, as the  official report for 1840 gives 500 neophytes.    Manuel Crespo was the comisionado for secularization in 1835, and he and  Padre Mercado had no happy times together. Mercado made it so unpleasant  that six other administrators were appointed in order to please him, but  it was a vain attempt. As a consequence, the Indians felt the  disturbances and discord, and became discontented and unmanageable.    In 1843, according to Governor Micheltorena's order of March 29, the  temporal control of the Mission was restored to the padre. But, though  the order was a kindly one, and relieved the padre from the interference  of officious, meddling, inefficient, and dishonest \"administrators,\" it  was too late to effect any real service.    As far as I can learn, Pico's plan did not affect San Antonio, and it  was not one of those sold by him in 1845-1846. In 1848 Padre Doroteo  Ambris was in charge as curate. For thirty years he remained here, true  to his calling, an entirely different kind of man from the quarrelsome,  arrogant, drinking, and gambling Mercado. He finally died at San  Antonio, and was buried in the Mission he guarded so well.    In 1904 the California Historic Landmarks League (Inc.) undertook the  preservation of San Antonio, but little has yet been accomplished. Much  more should speedily be done, if the walls are to be kept from falling.        CHAPTER XIII    SAN GABRIEL, ARCANGEL    We have already seen that San Gabriel, the fourth Mission, was founded  September 8, 1771. The natives gave cheerful assistance in bringing  timber, erecting the wooden buildings, covering them with tules, and  constructing the stockade enclosure which surrounded them. They also  brought offerings of acorns and pine-nuts. In a few days so many of them  crowded into camp that Padre Somero went to San Diego for an addition to  the guard, and returned with two extra men. It was not long before the  soldiers got into trouble, owing to their treatment of the Indian women,  and an Indian attack, as before related, took place. A few days later,  Fages appeared on the scene from San Diego with sixteen soldiers and two  missionaries, who were destined as guard and priests for the new Mission  of San Buenaventura. But the difficulty with the Indians led Fages to  postpone the founding of the new Mission. The offending soldier was  hurried off to Monterey to get him out of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],[0,"The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#16)"],[1,"sort were more applicable to the present case, in which the distress  resulted from the unusual mode of war adopted by the enemy himself, in  having armed almost the whole laboring class of the French nation, for  the purpose of commencing and supporting hostilities against almost  all European Governments; but this reasoning was most of all  applicable to a trade, which was in a great measure carried on by the  then actual rulers of France, and was no longer to be regarded as a  mercantile speculation of individuals, but as an immediate operation  of the very persons who had declared war, and were then carrying it on  against Great Britain.    This reasoning was resisted by the neutral powers--Sweden, Denmark,  and especially the United States. The American Government insisted,  that when two nations go to war, other nations who choose to remain at  peace, retain their natural right to pursue their agriculture,  manufactures, and ordinary vocations; to carry the produce of their  industry for exchange to all countries, belligerent or neutral, (as  usual;) to go and come freely without injury or molestation; in short,  that the war, (amongst other) should be for neutral purposes, as if it  did not exist; the only exceptions being trade in implements of war,  or to a place blockaded by its enemy. That there were sufficient  treaties to decide what were implements of war. Corn, flour, and meal,  were not of the class of contraband.    The result of this controversy was a treaty with the United States in  1794. It confined contraband to military and naval stores; and with  respect to provisions not generally contraband, it was agreed,         \"That whenever such articles became contraband by the Law of       Nations, and should for that reason be seized, the same       should not be confiscated, but the owners thereof should be       speedily and completely indemnified; and the captors, or in       their default, the Government under whose authority they       act, should pay to the masters or owners of such vessels the       full value of all such articles, with a reasonable       mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight, and       also the demurrage incident to such detention.\"    The instructions of June, 1793, had been revoked previously to the  signature of this treaty; but before its ratification, the British  Government issued, in April, 1795, an order in council, instructing  its cruizers to stop and detain all vessels laden wholly, or in part,  with corn, flour, meal, and other provisions, and bound to any port in  France, and to send them to such ports as might be most convenient, in  order that such corn, &c., might be purchased on behalf of Government.    This last order was subsequently revoked, and the question of its  legality became the subject of discussion in a mixed commission,  constituted under the treaty, to decide upon the claims of American  citizens, by reason of irregular or illegal seizures of their vessels  and cargoes, under the authority of the British Government.    A full indemnification was allowed by the commissioners, under the 7th  article of the Treaty of 1794, to the owners of vessels and cargoes  seized under the orders in council, as well for the loss of a market  as for the other consequences of their detention.    It was, however, urged on the part of the United States, that the 18th  article of the Treaty of 1794, manifestly intended to leave the  question where it was before, namely, that when _the law of nations_,  existing at the time the case arises, pronounces the articles  contraband, they may for that reason be seized; when otherwise, not  so. Each party was thus left free to decide what was contraband in its  own courts of the law of nations, leaving any false appeal to that law  to the usual remedy of reprisals and war.[172]    Since the ratification of this treaty, we have a decision of Lord  Stowell, in 1799, on this very subject, in the case of the Haabet,  which, however, arose on a question of insurance.         \"The right of taking possession of provisions is no peculiar       claim of this country; it belongs generally to belligerent       nations: the ancient practice of Europe, or at least of       several maritime states of Europe, was to confiscate them       entirely. A century has now elapsed since this claim has       been asserted by some of them. A more mitigated practice has       prevailed in later times, of holding such cargoes subject       only to a right of pre-emption; that is, to a right of       purchase, upon a reasonable compensation, to the individual       whose property is thus diverted. This claim on the part of       the belligerent cannot go beyond cargoes avowedly bound to       the enemy's ports, or suspected on just grounds to have a       concealed destination of that kind. The neutral can only       expect a reasonable compensation. He cannot look to the       price he would obtain in the enemy's port. An enemy,       distressed by famine, may be driven by his necessities to       pay a famine price; but it does not follow that the       belligerent, in the exercise of his rights of war, is to pay       the price of distress.\"[173]         \"It is a mitigated exercise of war, on which any purchase is       made; and no rule has established that such a purchase shall       be regulated exactly on the same terms of profit which would       have followed the adventure, if no such exercise of war had       intervened; it is a _reasonable_ indemnification, and a       _fair profit_, that is due, reference being had to the price       originally paid by the exporter, and the expenses he has       incurred.\"    [Sidenote: Neutral Vessels Transporting Enemy's Forces.]    Transporting the _Enemy's Forces_, subjects a Neutral Vessel to  confiscation, if captured by the opposite belligerent. Sir Wm. Scott  says, in the leading case on this subject--         \"That a vessel hired, by the enemy, for the conveyance of       military persons is to be considered _as a transport_,       subject to condemnation, has been in a recent case, held by       this Court, and on other occasions.[174] What is the number       of military persons that shall constitute such a case it may       be difficult to define. In the former cases there were many,       in the present they are fewer in number; number alone is an       insignificant circumstance in the considerations on which       the principles of law on this subject are built; since fewer       persons of high quality and character may be of more       importance than a much greater number of persons of lower       condition. To send out _one veteran general_ of France to       take command of the forces at Batavia might be a much more       noxious act than the conveyance of a whole regiment. The       consequences of such assistance are greater, and therefore       it is what the belligerent has a stronger right to prevent       and punish. In this instance the military persons are       three,[175] and there are besides two other persons who were       going to be employed in civil capacities in the Government       of Batavia. *** It appears to me, _on principle_, to be but       reasonable that, whenever it is of sufficient importance to       the enemy that such persons should be sent out on the public       service, and at the public expense, it should afford equal       ground of forfeiture against the vessel that may be let out       for a purpose so intimately connected with hostile       operations.[176] The fact of the vessel having been pressed       into the enemy's service does not exempt her. The master       cannot aver that he was an involuntary agent.\"[177]    [Sidenote: Neutral Ships Carrying Enemy's Despatches.]    Carrying the _Despatches of the Enemy_ is also a ground of  condemnation.         \"In the transmission of Despatches may be conveyed the       entire plan of a campaign, that may defeat all the plans of       the other belligerent, in the world. It is a service,       therefore, which, in whatever degree it exists, can only be       considered in one character--as an act of the most hostile       nature. The offence of _fraudulently_ carrying despatches in       the service of the enemy being greater than other       contraband, some other penalty has to be affixed. The       confiscation of the noxious article would be ridiculous when       applied to _Despatches_. There would be _no_ freight       dependent on their transportation. The _vehicle_ (_i.e._ the       ship) in which they are carried must, therefore, be       forfeited.\"[178]    [Sidenote: Ambassadors excepted.]    The Despatches of an Ambassador or other Public Minister of the Enemy,  resident in a neutral country, are an exception to this rule, being  the despatches of persons who are in a peculiar manner the favourite  object of the Law of Nations, residing in the neutral country for the  purpose of preserving peace and the relations of amity between that  state and their own government.    The ambassador of the enemy may be stopped on his passage, but when he  has arrived in the neutral country, he becomes a sort of _middleman_,  and is entitled to peculiar privileges.[179]    [Sidenote: Penalty for Contraband Trade.]    Under the present Law of Nations, a Contraband Cargo cannot affect the  ship; the carrying of contraband articles is attended only with loss  of freight and expenses, except where the ship belongs to the owner of  the contraband cargo, or where the simple misconduct of carrying a  contraband cargo has been connected with some malignant and  aggravating circumstances.[180]    [Sidenote: Additional Penalties.]    The aggravation of fraud justifies additional Penalties; thus, the  carriage of contraband with a false destination, will work a  condemnation of the ship as well as the cargo; the false destination  being intended to defeat the right of pre-emption.[181]"]]]
