The exciting charm of the risky and dangerous  naturally arises on a background of feminine shyness and timidity. We may  trace its recognition at a very early stage of history in the story of Eve  and the forbidden fruit that has so often been the symbol of the masculine  organs of sex. It is on this ground that many have argued the folly of  laying external restrictions on women in matters of love. Thus in quoting  the great Italian writer who afterwards became Pope Pius II, Robert Burton  remarked: \"I am of AEneas Sylvius' mind, 'Those jealous Italians do very  ill to lock up their wives; for women are of such a disposition they will  mostly covet that which is denied most, and offend least when they have  free liberty to trespass.'\"[20]    It is the spontaneous and natural instinct of the lover to desire modesty  in his mistress, and by no means any calculated opinion on his part that  modesty is the sign of sexual emotion. It remains true, however, that  modesty is an expression of feminine erotic impulse. We have here one of  the instances, of which there, are so many, of that curious and  instinctive harmony by which Nature has sought the more effectively to  bring about the ends of courtship. As to the fact itself there can be  little doubt. It constantly forces itself on the notice of careful  observers, and has long been decided in the affirmative by those who have  discussed the matter. Venette, one of the earliest writers on the  psychology of sex, after discussing the question at length, decided that  the timid woman is a more ardent lover than the bold woman.[21] \"It is the  most pudent girl,\" remarked Restif de la Bretonne whose experience of  women was so extensive, \"the girl who blushes most, who is most disposed  to the pleasures of love,\" he adds that, in girls and boys alike, shyness  is a premature consciousness of sex.[22] This observation has even become  embodied in popular proverbs. \"Do as the lasses do--say no, but take it,\"  is a Scotch saying, to which corresponds the Welsh saying, \"The more  prudish the more unchaste.\"[23]        It is not, at first, quite clear why an excessively shy and      modest woman should be the most apt for intimate relationships      with a man, and in such a case the woman is often charged with      hypocrisy. There is, however, no hypocrisy in the matter. The shy      and reserved woman holds herself aloof from intimacy in ordinary      friendship, because she is acutely sensitive to the judgments of      others, and fears that any seemingly immodest action may make an      unfavorable opinion. With a lover, however, in whose eyes she      feels assured that her actions can not be viewed unfavorably,      these barriers of modesty fall down, and the resulting intimacy      becomes all the more fascinating to the woman because of its      contrast with the extreme reserve she is impelled to maintain in      other relationships. It thus happens that many modest women who,      in non-sexual relationships with their own sex, are not able to      act with the physical unreserve not uncommon with women among      themselves, yet feel no such reserve with a man, when they are      once confident of his good opinion. Much the same is true of      modest and sensitive men in their relations with women.    This fundamental animal factor of modesty, rooted in the natural facts of  the sexual life of the higher mammals, and especially man, obviously will  not explain all the phenomena of modesty. We must turn to the other great  primary element of modesty, the social factor.    We cannot doubt that one of the most primitive and universal of the social  characteristics of man is an aptitude for disgust, founded, as it is, on a  yet more primitive and animal aptitude for disgust, which has little or no  social significance. In nearly all races, even the most savage, we seem  to find distinct traces of this aptitude for disgust in the presence of  certain actions of others, an emotion naturally reflected in the  individual's own actions, and hence a guide to conduct. Notwithstanding  our gastric community of disgust with lower animals, it is only in man  that this disgust seems to become transformed and developed, to possess a  distinctly social character, and to serve as a guide to social  conduct.[24] The objects of disgust vary infinitely according to the  circumstances and habits of particular races, but the reaction of disgust  is fundamental throughout.    The best study of the phenomena of disgust known to me is, without doubt,  Professor Richet's.[25] Richet concludes that it is the _dangerous_ and  the _useless_ which evoke disgust. The digestive and sexual excretions and  secretions, being either useless or, in accordance with widespread  primitive ideas, highly dangerous, the genito-anal region became a  concentrated focus of disgust.[26] It is largely for this reason, no  doubt, that savage men exhibit modesty, not only toward women, but toward  their own sex, and that so many of the lowest savages take great  precautions in obtaining seclusion for the fulfillment of natural  functions. The statement, now so often made, that the primary object of  clothes is to accentuate, rather than to conceal, has in it--as I shall  point out later--a large element of truth, but it is by no means a  complete account of the matter. It seems difficult not to admit that,  alongside the impulse to accentuate sexual differences, there is also in  both men and women a genuine impulse to concealment among the most  primitive peoples, and the invincible repugnance often felt by savages to  remove the girdle or apron, is scarcely accounted for by the theory that  it is solely a sexual lure.    In this connection it seems to me instructive to consider a special form  of modesty very strongly marked among savages in some parts of the world.  I refer to the feeling of immodesty in eating. Where this feeling exists,  modesty is offended when one eats in public; the modest man retires to  eat. Indecency, said Cook, was utterly unknown among the Tahitians; but  they would not eat together; even brothers and sisters had their separate  baskets of provisions, and generally sat some yards apart, with their  backs to each other, when they ate.[27] The Warrua of Central Africa,  Cameron found, when offered a drink, put up a cloth before their faces  while they swallowed it, and would not allow anyone to see them eat or  drink; so that every man or woman must have his own fire and cook for  himself.[28] Karl von den Steinen remarks, in his interesting book on  Brazil, that though the Bakairi of Central Brazil have no feeling of shame  about nakedness, they are ashamed to eat in public; they retire to eat,  and hung their heads in shame-faced confusion when they saw him innocently  eat in public. Hrolf Vaughan Stevens found that, when he gave an Orang  Laut (Malay) woman anything to eat, she not only would not eat it if her  husband were present, but if any man were present she would go outside  before eating or giving her children to eat.[29] Thus among these peoples  the act of eating in public produces the same feelings as among ourselves  the indecent exposure of the body in public.[30]    It is quite easy to understand how this arises. Whenever there is any  pressure on the means of subsistence, as among savages at some time or  another there nearly always is, it must necessarily arouse a profound and  mixed emotion of desire and disgust to see another person putting into his  stomach what one might just as well have put into one's own.[31] The  special secrecy sometimes observed by women is probably due to the fact  that women would be less able to resist the emotions that the act of  eating would arouse in onlookers. As social feeling develops, a man  desires not only to eat in safety, but also to avoid being an object of  disgust, and to spare his friends all unpleasant emotions. Hence it  becomes a requirement of ordinary decency to eat in private. A man who  eats in public becomes--like the man who in our cities exposes his person  in public--an object of disgust and contempt.    Long ago, when a hospital student on midwifery duty in London slums, I had  occasion to observe that among the women of the poor, and more especially  in those who had lost the first bloom of youth, modesty consisted chiefly  in the fear of being disgusting. There was an almost pathetic anxiety, in  the face of pain and discomfort, not to be disgusting in the doctor's  eyes. This anxiety expressed itself in the ordinary symptoms of modesty.  But, as soon as the woman realized that I found nothing disgusting in  whatever was proper and necessary to be done under the circumstances, it  almost invariably happened that every sign of modesty at once  disappeared.[32] In the special and elementary conditions of parturition,  modesty is reduced to this one fear of causing disgust; so that, when that  is negated, the emotion is non-existent, and the subject becomes, without  effort, as direct and natural as a little child. A fellow-student on  similar duty, who also discovered for himself the same character of  modesty--that if he was careful to guard her modesty the woman was careful  also, and that if he was not the woman was not--remarked on it to me with  sadness; it seemed to him derogatory to womanhood that what he had been  accustomed to consider its supreme grace should be so superficial that he  could at will set limits to it.[33] I thought then, as I think still, that  that was rather a perversion of the matter, and that nothing becomes  degrading because we happen to have learned something about its  operations. But I am more convinced than ever that the fear of causing  disgust--a fear quite distinct from that of losing a sexual lure or  breaking a rule of social etiquette--plays a very large part in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13611"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 2 (#16)"],[1,"alitaet_, p.  650 et seq., there will be found some account of many eminent men who are,  on more or less reliable grounds, suspected of homosexuality. Other German  writers brought forward as inverted are Platen, K.P. Moritz, and Iffland.  Platen was clearly a congenital invert, who sought, however, the  satisfaction of his impulses in Platonic friendship; his homosexual poems  and the recently published unabridged edition of his diary render him an  interesting object of study; see for a sympathetic account of him, Ludwig  Frey, \"Aus dem Seelenleben des Grafen Platen,\" _Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle  Zwischenstufen_, vols. i and vi. Various kings and potentates have been  mentioned in this connection, including the Sultan Baber; Henri III of  France; Edward II, William II, James I, and William III of England, and  perhaps Queen Anne and George III, Frederick the Great and his brother,  Heinrich, Popes Paul II, Sixtus IV, and Julius II, Ludwig II of Bavaria,  and others. Kings, indeed, seem peculiarly inclined to homosexuality.    [68] Schultz, _Das Hoefische Leben_, Bd. i, ch. xiii.

[72] Thus she writes in 1701 (_Correspondence_, edited by Brunet, vol. i,  p. 58): \"Our heroes take as their models Hercules, Theseus, Alexander, and  Caesar, who all had their male favorites. Those who give themselves up to  this vice, while believing in Holy Scripture, imagine that it was only a  sin when there were few people in the world, and that now the earth is  populated it may be regarded as a _divertissement_. Among the common  people, indeed, accusations of this kind are, so far as possible, avoided;  but among persons of quality it is publicly spoken of; it is considered a  fine saying that since Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord has punished no one  for such offences.\"    [73] Serieux and Libert, \"La Bastille et ses Prisonniers,\" _L'Encephale_,  September, 1911.    [74] Witry, \"Notes Historiques sur l'Homosexualite en France,\" _Revue de  l'Hypnotisme_, January, 1909.    [75] In early Teutonic days there was little or no trace of any punishment  for homosexual practices in Germany. This, according to Hermann Michaelis,  only appeared after the Church had gained power among the West Goths; in  the Breviarium of Alaric II (506), the sodomist was condemned to the  stake, and later, in the seventh century, by an edict of King  Chindasvinds, to castration. The Frankish capitularies of Charlemange's  time adopted ecclesiastical penances. In the thirteenth and fourteenth  centuries death by fire was ordained, and the punishments enacted by the  German codes tended to become much more ferocious than that edicted by the  Justinian code on which they were modelled.    [76] Raffalovich discusses German friendship, _Uranisme et Unisexualite_,  pp. 157-9. See also Birnbaum, _Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, Bd.  viii, p. 611; he especially illustrates this kind of friendship by the  correspondence of the poets Gleim and Jacobi, who used to each other the  language of lovers, which, indeed, they constantly called themselves.    [77] This letter may be found in Ernst Schur's _Heinrich von Kleist in  seinen Briefen_, p. 295. Dr. J. Sadger has written a pathographic and  psychological study of Kleist, emphasizing the homosexual strain, in the  _Grenzfragen des Nerven- und Seelenlebens_ series.    [78] Alexander's not less distinguished brother, Wilhelm von Humboldt,  though not homosexual, possessed, a woman wrote to him, \"the soul of a  woman and the most tender feeling for womanliness I have ever found in  your sex;\" he himself admitted the feminine traits in his nature. Spranger  (_Wilhelm von Humboldt_, p. 288) says of him that \"he had that dual  sexuality without which the moral summits of humanity cannot be reached.\"    [79] Krupp caused much scandal by his life at Capri, where he was  constantly surrounded by the handsome youths of the place, mandolinists  and street arabs, with whom he was on familiar terms, and on whom he  lavished money. H.D. Davray, a reliable eyewitness, has written \"Souvenirs  sur M. Krupp a Capri,\" _L'Europeen_, 29 November, 1902. It is not,  however, definitely agreed that Krupp was of fully developed homosexual  temperament (see, e.g., _Jahrbuch f. sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, Bd. v, p.  1303 et seq.) An account of his life at Capri was published in the  _Vorwaerts_, against which Krupp finally brought a libel action; but he  died immediately afterward, it is widely believed, by his own hand, and  the libel action was withdrawn.    [80] Madame, the mother of the Regent, in her letters of 12th October, 4th  November, and 13th December, 1701, repeatedly makes this assertion, and  implies that it was supported by the English who at that time came over to  Paris with the English Ambassador, Lord Portland. The King was very  indifferent to women.    [81] Anselm, Epistola lxii, in Migne's _Patrologia_, vol. clix, col. 95.  John of Salisbury, in his _Polycrates_, describes the homosexual and  effeminate habits of his time.    [82] Pollock and Maitland, _History of English Law_, vol. ii, p. 556.    [83] Coleridge in his _Table Talk_ (14 May, 1833) remarked: \"A man may,  under certain states of the moral feeling, entertain something deserving  the name of love towards a male object--an affection beyond friendship,  and wholly aloof from appetite. In Elizabeth's and James's time it seems  to have been almost fashionable to cherish such a feeling. Certainly the  language of the two friends Musidorus and Pyrocles in the _Arcadia_ is  such as we could not use except to women.\" This passage of Coleridge's is  interesting as an early English recognition by a distinguished man of  genius of what may be termed ideal homosexuality.    [84] See account of Udall in the _National Dictionary of Biography_.    [85] _Complete Poems of Richard Barnfield_, edited with an introduction by  A.B. Grosart, 1876. The poems of Barnfield were also edited by Arber, in  the English Scholar's Library, 1883. Arber, who always felt much horror  for the abnormal, argues that Barnfield's occupation with homosexual  topics was merely due to a search for novelty, that it was \"for the most  part but an amusement and had little serious or personal in it.\" Those  readers of Barnfield, however, who are acquainted with homosexual  literature will scarcely fail to recognize a personal preoccupation in his  poems. This is also the opinion of Moll in his _Beruehmte Homosexuelle_.    [86] See appendix to my edition of Marlowe in the _Mermaid Series_, first  edition. For a study of Marlowe's \"Gaveston,\" regarded as \"the  hermaphrodite in soul,\" see J.A. Nicklin, _Free Review_, December, 1895.    [87] As Raffalovich acutely points out, the twentieth sonnet, with its  reference to the \"one thing to my purpose nothing,\" is alone enough to  show that Shakespeare was not a genuine invert, as then he would have  found the virility of the loved object beautiful. His sonnets may fairly  be compared to the _In Memoriam_ of Tennyson, whom it is impossible to  describe as inverted, though in his youth he cherished an ardent  friendship for another youth, such as was also felt in youth by Montaigne.    [88] A scene in Vanbrugh's _Relapse_, and the chapter (ch. li) in  Smollett's _Roderick Random_ describing Lord Strutwell, may also be  mentioned as evidencing familiarity with inversion. \"In our country,\" said  Lord Strutwell to Rawdon, putting forward arguments familiar to modern  champions of homosexuality, \"it gains ground apace, and in all probability  will become in a short time a more fashionable vice than simple  fornication.\"    [89] These observations on eighteenth century homosexuality in London are  chiefly based on the volumes of _Select Trials_ at the Old Bailey,  published in 1734.    [90] Numa Praetorius (_Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, Bd. iv, p.  885), who has studied Byron from this point of view, considers that,  though his biography has not yet been fully written on the sexual side, he  was probably of bisexual temperament; Raffalovich (_Uranisme et  Unisexualite_, p. 309) is of the same opinion.    [91] A youthful attraction of this kind in a poet is well illustrated by  Dolben, who died at the age of nineteen. In addition to a passion for  Greek poetry he cherished a romantic friendship of extraordinary ardor,  revealed in his poems, for a slightly older schoolfellow, who was never  even aware of the idolatry he aroused. Dolben's life has been written, and  his poems edited, by his friend the eminent poet, Robert Bridges (_The  Poems of D.M. Dolben_, edited with a Memoir by R. Bridges, 1911).    [92] A well-informed narrative of the Oscar Wilde trial is given by  Raffalovich in his _Uranisme et Unisexualite_, pp. 241-281; the full  report of the trial has been published by Mason. The best life of Wilde is  probably that of Arthur Ransome. Andre Gide's little volume of  reminiscences, _Oscar Wilde_ (also translated into English), is well worth  reading. Wilde has been discussed in relation to homosexuality by Numa  Praetorius (_Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vol. iii, 1901). An  instructive document, an unpublished portion of _De Profundis_, in which  Wilde sought to lay the blame for his misfortune on a friend,--his  \"ancient affection\" for whom has, he declares, been turned to \"loathing,  bitterness, and contempt,\"--was published in the _Times_, 18th April,  1913; it clearly reveals an element of weakness of character.
