The man is a brother's child of  the three brothers that formerly--now thirty-two years ago--were at  Umzilikatse's, and then made the peace with him which holds to this  day. He still remembers well when the first Boers, Franz Joubert,  Jann Joubert, and Pieter Joubert, came there, and when they made the  the peace which is so strong that the vile evil-doers were never able  to destroy it, and never shall be able to destroy it as long as there  shall be one Boer that lives and Lo Bengula also lives.    Now I wish to send something to give Lo Bengula a present as a token  of our friendship. I send for Lo Bengula with the gentleman who will  bring him this letter a blanket and a handkerchief for his great  wife, who is the mother of all the Matabele nation. I will one day  come to see their friendship. The gentleman who brings the letter  will tell you about all the work which I have to do here. Some bad  people have incited Kolahing, and so he thought he would make  fortifications and fight with us, but he got frightened, and saw that  he would be killed, therefore I made him break down the  fortifications and pack all the stones in one heap, and he had then  to pay 5,000 cattle and 4,000 sheep and goats for his wickedness. Now  there is another chief, Gatsizibe--he came upon our land and killed  three people and plundered them--he must also pay a fine, or else we  will punish him or shoot him, because we will have peace in our  country. Now greetings, great Chief Lo Bengula, from the  Commandant-General of the South African Republic for the Government  and Administration.      P.J. JOUBERT.      A big trek (the Banjailand trek) was organized in 1890 and 1891 by  General Joubert and his relatives and supporters to occupy a portion  of the territory already proclaimed as under British protection and  the administration of the Chartered Company. The trekkers were turned  back at Rhodes's Drift, stopped by the firmness and courage and tact  of Dr. Jameson, who met them alone and unarmed; and also by the  proclamation of President Kruger, to whom it had been plainly  intimated that the invasion would be forcibly resisted and would  inevitably provoke war. The matter had gone so far that the offices  of the Republic of Banjai had already been allotted. The President's  proclamation instead of being regarded as the barest fulfilment of  his obligations--very grudgingly done under pressure of threats--was  vaunted as an act of supreme magnanimity and generosity, and was used  in the bargaining for the cession of Swaziland.    In Tongaland Boer emissaries were not idle; but they failed, owing to  the fact that the Tonga Queen Regent, Zambili, a really fine specimen  of the savage ruler, would have nothing to do with any power but  England, whose suzerainty she accepted in 1887. Being shut off here,  the Boer Government made another bid for seaward extension, and,  through their emissaries, obtained certain rights from two petty  chiefs, Zambaan and Umbegesa, whom they represented as independent  kings; but Lord Rosebery annexed their territories in 1894, and so  put a final stop to the Transvaal schemes to evade the Convention by  intrigue with neighbouring native tribes.    Nothing can better illustrate the Boers' deliberate evasion of their  treaty obligations than their conduct in these matters. The Pretoria  Convention defined the Transvaal boundaries and acknowledged the  independence of the Swazis, and yet the British Government's delay in  consenting to the annexation of Swaziland by the Republic was  regarded for years as an intolerable grievance, and was proclaimed as  such so insistently that nearly all South Africa came at last to so  regard it.    The Boers' consent to the Chartered Company's occupation of  Mashonaland was looked upon as something calling for a _quid pro  quo_, and the annexation of Zambaan's land is now regarded as an  infamous act of piracy by England, and an infringement of the  Republic's rights, which the Dutch papers denounce most vehemently.  The Boer Government made it clear, not less in their purely internal  policy than in these matters of extensions of territory, that they  intended pursuing a line of their own.    In 1882, the property known as 'Moodies,' consisting of a number of  farms bearing indications of gold, was thrown open to prospectors.  The farms had been allotted to Mr. G. Piggott Moodie when he was  Surveyor-General, in lieu of salary which the Republic was unable to  pay. This was the beginning of the prospecting era which opened up De  Kaap, Witwatersrand, and other fields; but it was a small beginning,  and for some time nothing worth mentioning was discovered. The  Republic was again in a bad way, and drifting backwards after its  first spurt. The greatest uncertainty prevailed amongst prospectors  as to their titles, for in Lydenburg, at Pilgrim's Rest, and on the  Devil's Kantoor, concessions had been granted over the heads of the  miners at work on their claims, and they had been turned off for the  benefit of men who contributed in no way to the welfare and  prosperity of the State. It has been stated in the Volksraad that not  one of those concessionaires has even paid the dues and rents, or  complied with the other conditions stipulated in the contracts.  district was practically locked up for fourteen years owing to the  concession policy, and has only lately been partly released from the  bonds of monopoly.    In 1884 Messrs. Kruger and Smit proceeded to Europe to endeavour to  raise funds, which were badly needed, and also to obtain some  modifications of the Convention. The attempt to raise funds through  the parties in Holland to whom the railway concession had just been  granted failed, but the delegates were more fortunate in their other  negotiations. They negotiated the London Convention which fixed  certain hitherto undefined boundaries; and in that document no  reference was made to the suzerainty of Great Britain. They also  secured the consent of the British Government to the alteration of  the title of the country. Instead of Transvaal State it became once  more the 'South African Republic.'{07} During this visit there  occurred an incident which provides the answer to Mr. Kruger's  oft--_too_ oft--repeated remark that 'the Uitlanders were never asked  to settle in the Transvaal, and are not wanted there.' Messrs. Kruger  and Smit were staying at the Albemarle Hotel, where they found  themselves, after some weeks' delay, in the uncomfortable position of  being unable to pay their hotel bill. In their extremity they applied  to one Baron Grant, at that time a bright particular star in the  Stock Exchange firmament. Baron Grant was largely interested in the  gold concessions of Lydenburg, and he was willing to assist, but on  terms. And the _quid pro quo_ which he asked was some public  assurance of goodwill, protection, and encouragement to British  settlers in the Transvaal. Mr. Kruger responded on behalf of the  Republic by publishing in the London press the cordial invitation  and welcome and the promise of rights and protection to all who  would come, so frequently quoted against him of late.    By this time Moodies had attracted a fair number of people, and the  prospects of the country began, for the first time with some show of  reason, to look brighter. No results were felt, however, and the  condition of the Government officials was deplorable. Smuggling was  carried on systematically; in many cases officials 'stood in' with  smugglers. They were obliged either to do that or to enforce the laws  properly and get what they could by seizing contraband goods. There  were two objections to the latter course, however. One was that the  country was large and detection difficult with men who were both  daring and resourceful; and the other was that the officials were not  sure of receiving their share of the spoil from a Government so hard  pressed as this one was, and whose higher officials also had  difficulties about payment of salaries. In many cases salaries were  six months in arrear; and other cases could be quoted of officials  whose house-rent alone amounted to more than their nominal  remuneration. Yet they continued to live, and it was not difficult to  surmise _how_. Another significant fact was that goods subject to  heavy duties--such as spirits, hams, etc.--could be bought at any  store at a price which was less than original cost plus carriage and  duty. Smuggling was a very palpable fact, and--quoth the public and  the officials--a very convenient and even necessary evil.    The principle on which the Customs officials conducted the business  of their office was observed by other officials of the Republic, and  in one department, at least, the abuses have had a very far-reaching  and serious effect. The Field-cornets--district officials who act as  petty justices, registering, and pass officers, collectors of  personal taxes, captains of the burgher forces, etc., etc.--are the  officers with whom each newcomer has to register. This is an  important matter, because the period of residence for the purpose of  naturalization and enfranchisement is reckoned from the date of  registration in the Field-cornet's books. As these officials were  practically turned loose on the public to make a living the best  way they could, many of them, notwithstanding that they collected the  taxes imposed by law, omitted to enter the names of new arrivals in  their books, thus securing themselves against having to make good  these amounts in event of an inspection of the books.

Had ye believed in God when He revealed  Himself, the people would not have turned aside from Him, nor would the  things ye witness today have befallen Us. Fear God, and be not of the  heedless.    167 Beware lest any name debar you from Him Who is the Possessor of all  names, or any word shut you out from this Remembrance of God, this Source  of Wisdom amongst you. Turn unto God and seek His protection, O concourse  of divines, and make not of yourselves a veil between Me and My creatures.  Thus doth your Lord admonish you, and command you to be just, lest your  works should come to naught and ye yourselves be oblivious of your plight.  Shall he who denieth this Cause be able to vindicate the truth of any  cause throughout creation? Nay, by Him Who is the Fashioner of the  universe! Yet the people are wrapped in a palpable veil. Say: Through this  Cause the day-star of testimony hath dawned, and the luminary of proof  hath shed its radiance upon all that dwell on earth. Fear God, O men of  insight, and be not of those who disbelieve in Me. Take heed lest the word  \"Prophet\" withhold you from this Most Great Announcement, or any reference  to \"Vicegerency\" debar you from the sovereignty of Him Who is the  Vicegerent of God, which overshadoweth all the worlds. Every name hath  been created by His Word, and every cause is dependent on His  irresistible, His mighty and wondrous Cause. Say: This is the Day of God,  the Day on which naught shall be mentioned save His own Self, the  omnipotent Protector of all worlds. This is the Cause that hath made all  your superstitions and idols to tremble.    168 We, verily, see amongst you him who taketh hold of the Book of God and  citeth from it proofs and arguments wherewith to repudiate his Lord, even  as the followers of every other Faith sought reasons in their Holy Books  for refuting Him Who is the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God,  the True One, is My witness that neither the Scriptures of the world, nor  all the books and writings in existence, shall, in this Day, avail you  aught without this, the Living Book, Who proclaimeth in the midmost heart  of creation: \"Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.\"    169 O concourse of divines! Beware lest ye be the cause of strife in the  land, even as ye were the cause of the repudiation of the Faith in its  early days. Gather the people around this Word that hath made the pebbles  to cry out: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Dawning-place of all signs!\" Thus  doth your Lord admonish you, as a bounty on His part; He, of a truth, is  the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.    170 Call ye to mind Karim, and how, when We summoned him unto God, he  waxed disdainful, prompted by his own desires; yet We had sent him that  which was a solace to the eye of proof in the world of being and the  fulfilment of God's testimony to all the denizens of earth and heaven. As  a token of the grace of Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High, We  bade him embrace the Truth. But he turned away until, as an act of justice  from God, angels of wrath laid hold upon him. Unto this We truly were a  witness.    171 Tear the veils asunder in such wise that the inmates of the Kingdom  will hear them being rent. This is the command of God, in days gone by and  for those to come. Blessed the man that observeth that whereunto he was  bidden, and woe betide the negligent.    172 We, of a certainty, have had no purpose in this earthly realm save to  make God manifest and to reveal His sovereignty; sufficient unto Me is God  for a witness. We, of a certainty, have had no intent in the celestial  Kingdom but to exalt His Cause and glorify His praise; sufficient unto Me  is God for a protector. We, of a certainty, have had no desire in the  Dominion on high except to extol God and what hath been sent down by Him;  sufficient unto Me is God for a helper.    173 Happy are ye, O ye the learned ones in Baha. By the Lord! Ye are the  billows of the Most Mighty Ocean, the stars of the firmament of Glory, the  standards of triumph waving betwixt earth and heaven. Ye are the  manifestations of steadfastness amidst men and the daysprings of Divine  Utterance to all that dwell on earth. Well is it with him that turneth  unto you, and woe betide the froward. This day, it behoveth whoso hath  quaffed the Mystic Wine of everlasting life from the Hands of the  loving-kindness of the Lord his God, the Merciful, to pulsate even as the  throbbing artery in the body of mankind, that through him may be quickened  the world and every crumbling bone.    174 O people of the world! When the Mystic Dove will have winged its  flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and sought its far-off goal, its  hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever ye understand not in the Book to  Him Who hath branched from this mighty Stock.    175 O Pen of the Most High! Move Thou upon the Tablet at the bidding of  Thy Lord, the Creator of the Heavens, and tell of the time when He Who is  the Dayspring of Divine Unity purposed to direct His steps towards the  School of Transcendent Oneness; haply the pure in heart may gain thereby a  glimpse, be it as small as a needle's eye, of the mysteries of Thy Lord,  the Almighty, the Omniscient, that lie concealed behind the veils. Say:  We, indeed, set foot within the School of inner meaning and explanation  when all created things were unaware. We saw the words sent down by Him  Who is the All-Merciful, and We accepted the verses of God, the Help in  Peril, the Self-Subsisting, which He(11) presented unto Us, and hearkened  unto that which He had solemnly affirmed in the Tablet. This we assuredly  did behold. And We assented to His wish through Our behest, for truly We  are potent to command.    176 O people of the Bayan! We, verily, set foot within the School of God  when ye lay slumbering; and We perused the Tablet while ye were fast  asleep. By the one true God! We read the Tablet ere it was revealed, while  ye were unaware, and We had perfect knowledge of the Book when ye were yet  unborn. These words are to your measure, not to God's. To this testifieth  that which is enshrined within His knowledge, if ye be of them that  comprehend; and to this the tongue of the Almighty doth bear witness, if  ye be of those who understand. I swear by God, were We to lift the veil,  ye would be dumbfounded.    177 Take heed that ye dispute not idly concerning the Almighty and His  Cause, for lo! He hath appeared amongst you invested with a Revelation so  great as to encompass all things, whether of the past or of the future.  Were We to address Our theme by speaking in the language of the inmates of  the Kingdom, We would say: \"In truth, God created that School ere He  created heaven and earth, and We entered it before the letters B and E  were joined and knit together.\" Such is the language of Our servants in  Our Kingdom; consider what the tongue of the dwellers of Our exalted  Dominion would utter, for We have taught them Our knowledge and have  revealed to them whatever had lain hidden in God's wisdom. Imagine then  what the Tongue of Might and Grandeur would utter in His All-Glorious  Abode!    178 This is not a Cause which may be made a plaything for your idle  fancies, nor is it a field for the foolish and faint of heart. By God,  this is the arena of insight and detachment, of vision and upliftment,  where none may spur on their chargers save the valiant horsemen of the  Merciful, who have severed all attachment to the world of being. These,  truly, are they that render God victorious on earth, and are the  dawning-places of His sovereign might amidst mankind.    179 Beware lest aught that hath been revealed in the Bayan should keep you  from your Lord, the Most Compassionate. God is My witness that the Bayan  was sent down for no other purpose than to celebrate My praise, did ye but  know! In it the pure in heart will find only the fragrance of My love,  only My Name that overshadoweth all that seeth and is seen. Say: Turn ye,  O people, unto that which hath proceeded from My Most Exalted Pen. Should  ye inhale therefrom the fragrance of God, set not yourselves against Him,  nor deny yourselves a portion of His gracious favour and His manifold  bestowals. Thus doth your Lord admonish you; He, verily, is the  Counsellor, the Omniscient.    180 Whatsoever ye understand not in the Bayan, ask it of God, your Lord  and the Lord of your forefathers. Should He so desire, He will expound for  you that which is revealed therein, and disclose to you the pearls of  Divine knowledge and wisdom that lie concealed within the ocean of its  words. He, verily, is supreme over all names; no God is there but Him, the  Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    181 The world's equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating  influence of this most great, this new World Order. Mankind's ordered life  hath been revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous  System--the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed.    182 Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye may unravel its  secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths.  Take heed that ye do not vacillate in your determination to embrace the  truth of this Cause--a Cause through which the potentialities of the might  of God have been revealed, and His sovereignty established. With faces  beaming with joy, hasten ye unto Him. This is the changeless Faith of God,  eternal in the past, eternal in the future. Let him that seeketh, attain  it; and as to him that hath refused to seek it--verily, God is  Self-Sufficient, above any need of His creatures.    183 Say: This is the infallible Balance which the Hand of God is holding,  in which all who"]]]
