The two lowest courses project so as to form a  kind of pedestal for the building. The cornice at the top consists of  a deep moulding, surmounted by a broad flat band, above which rises the  pyramid, which attains a height of nearly thirty feet. It is impossible  to deny that it is constructed on a foreign model; it is not a slavish  imitation, however, but rather an adaptation upon a rational plan to  the conditions of its new home. Its foundations rest on nothing but a  mixture of soil and sand impregnated with water, and if vaults had been  constructed beneath this, as in Egypt, the body placed there would soon  have corrupted away, owing to the infiltration of moisture. The dead  bodies were, therefore, placed within the structure above ground, in  chambers corresponding to the Egyptian chapel, which were superimposed  the one upon the other. The first storey would furnish space for three  bodies, and the second would contain twelve, for which as many niches  were provided. In the same cemetery we find examples of tombs which the  architect has constructed, not after an Egyptian, but a Chaldaean model.  A round tower is here substituted for the square structure and a  cupola for the pyramid, while the cornice is represented by crenellated  markings. The only Egyptian feature about it is the four lions, which  seem to support the whole edifice upon their backs.*         * The fellahin in the neighbourhood call these two monuments       the Meghazil or \"distaffs.\"    Arvad was, among Phoenician cities, the nearest neighbour to the  kingdoms on the Euphrates, and was thus the first to experience either  the brunt of an attack or the propagation of fashions and ideas from  these countries. In the more southerly region, in the country about  Tyre, there are fewer indications of Babylonian influence, and such  examples of burying-places for the ruling classes as the Kabr-Hiram  and other similar tombs correspond with the mixed mastaba of the Theban  period. We have the same rectangular base, but the chapel and its  crowning pyramid are represented by the sarcophagus itself with its  rigid cover. The work is of an unfinished character, and carelessly  wrought, but there is a charming simplicity about its lines and a  harmony in its proportions which betray an Egyptian influence.

The spirit of imitation which we find in the religion and architecture  of Phoenicia is no less displayed in the minor arts, such as  goldsmiths'work, sculpture in ivory, engraving on gems, and  glass-making. The forms, designs, and colours are all rather those of  Egypt than of Chaldaea. The many-hued glass objects, turned out by the  manufacturers of the Said in millions, furnished at one time valuable  cargoes for the Phoenicians; they learned at length to cast and  colour copies of these at home, and imitated their Egyptian models so  successfully that classical antiquity was often deceived by them.*         * Glass manufacture was carried to such a degree of       perfection among the Phoenicians, that many ancient authors       attributed to them the invention of glass.    Their engravers, while still continuing to employ cones and cylinders  of Babylonian form, borrowed the scarab type also, and made use of it  on the bezils of rings, the pendants of necklaces, and on a kind of  bracelet used partly for ornament and partly as a protective amulet.  The influence of the Egyptian model did not extend, however, amongst the  masses, and we find, therefore, no evidence of it in the case of common  objects, such as those of coarse sand or glazed earthenware. Egyptian  scarab forms were thus confined to the rich, and the material upon which  they are found is generally some costly gem, such as cut and polished  agate, onyx, haematite, and lapis-lazuli. The goldsmiths did not  slavishly copy the golden and silver bowls which were imported from the  Delta; they took their inspiration from the principles displayed in  the ornamentation of these objects, but they treated the subjects  after their own manner, grouping them afresh and blending them with  new designs. The intrinsic value of the metal upon which these artistic  conceptions had been impressed led to their destruction, and among the  examples which have come down to us I know of no object which can be  traced to the period of the Egyptian conquest. It was Theban art for  the most part which furnished the Phoenicians with their designs. These  included the lotus, the papyrus, the cow standing in a thicket and  suckling her calf, the sacred bark, and the king threatening with his  uplifted arm the crowd of conquered foes who lie prostrate before him.    [Illustration: 117.jpg EGYPTIAN TREATMENT OF THE COW ON A PHOENICIAN  BOWL]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after Grifi.    The king's double often accompanied him on some of the original objects,  impassive and armed with the banner bearing the name of Horus. The  Phoenician artist modified this figure, which in its original form  did not satisfy his ideas of human nature, by transforming it into  a protective genius, who looks with approval on the exploits of his  _protege_, and gathers together the corpses of those he has slain. Once  these designs had become current among the goldsmiths, they continued to  be supplied for a long period, without much modification, to the markets  of the Eastern and Western worlds. Indeed, it was natural that they  should have taken a stereotyped form, when we consider that the  Phoenicians who employed them held continuous commercial relations  with the country whence they had come--a country of which, too, they  recognised the supremacy. Egypt in the Ramesside period was, as we  have seen, distinguished for the highest development of every branch of  industry; it had also a population which imported and exported more raw  material and more manufactured products than any other.    [Illustration: 118.jpg THE KING AND HIS DOUBLE ON A PHOENICIAN BOWL]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Longperier.    The small nation which acted as a commercial intermediary between Egypt  and the rest of the world had in this traffic a steady source of profit,  and even in providing Egypt with a single article--for example, bronze,  or the tin necessary for its preparation--could realise enormous  profits. The people of Tyre and Sidon had been very careful not to  alienate the good will of such rich customers, and as long as the  representatives of the Pharaoh held sway in Syria, they had shown  themselves, if not thoroughly trustworthy vassals, at least less  turbulent than their neighbours of Arvad and Qodshu. Even when the  feebleness and impotence of the successors of Ramses III. relieved them  from the obligation of further tribute, they displayed towards their old  masters such deference that they obtained as great freedom of trade with  the ports of the Delta as they had enjoyed in the past. They maintained  with these ports the same relations as in the days of their dependence,  and their ships sailed up the river as far as Memphis, and even higher,  while the Egyptian galleys continued to coast the littoral of Syria.  An official report addressed to Hrihor by one of the ministers of the  Theban Amon, indicates at one and the same time the manner in which  these voyages were accomplished, and the dangers to which their crews  were exposed. Hrihor, who was still high priest, was in need of foreign  timber to complete some work he had in hand, probably the repair of the  sacred barks, and commanded the official above mentioned to proceed  by sea to Byblos, to King Zikarbal,* in order to purchase cedars of  Lebanon.         * This is the name which classical tradition ascribed to the       first husband of Dido, the founder of Carthage--Sicharbas,       Sichaeus, Acerbas.    The messenger started from Tanis, coasted along Kharu, and put into  the harbour of Dor, which then belonged to the Zakkala: while he was  revictualling his ship, one of the sailors ran away with the cash-box.  The local ruler, Badilu, expressed at first his sympathy at this  misfortune, and gave his help to capture the robber; then unaccountably  changing his mind he threw the messenger into prison, who had  accordingly to send to Egypt to procure fresh funds for his liberation  and the accomplishment of his mission. Having arrived at Byblos, nothing  occurred there worthy of record. The wood having at length been cut and  put on board, the ship set sail homewards. Driven by contrary winds,  the vessel was thrown upon the coast of Alasia, where the crew were  graciously received by the Queen Khatiba. We have evidence everywhere,  it may be stated, as to the friendly disposition displayed, either with  or without the promptings of interest, towards the representative of the  Theban pontiff. Had he been ill-used, the Phoenicians living on Egyptian  territory would have been made to suffer for it.    Navigators had to take additional precautions, owing to the presence  of AEgean or Asiatic pirates on the routes followed by the mercantile  marine, which rendered their voyages dangerous and sometimes interrupted  them altogether. The Syrian coast-line was exposed to these marauders  quite as much as the African had been during the sixty or eighty years  which followed the death of Ramses II.; the seamen of the north--Achaeans  and Tyrseni, Lycians and Shardanians--had pillaged it on many occasions,  and in the invasion which followed these attacks it experienced as  little mercy as Naharaim, the Khati, and the region of the Amorites. The  fleets which carried the Philistines, the Zakkala, and their allies had  devastated the whole coast before they encountered the Egyptian ships of  Ramses III. near Magadil, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#16)"],[1,"ravages and tramples under his feet the fertile fields;\" he  burnt the villages and the crops, destroyed Arzashkun, and raised before  its gates a pyramid of human heads, surrounded by a circle of prisoners  impaled on stakes. He climbed the mountain chain of Iritia, and laid  waste Aramali and Zanziuna at his leisure, and descending for the second  time to the shores of Lake Van, renewed the rites he had performed there  in the first year of his reign, and engraved on a neighbouring rock an  inscription recording his deeds of prowess.    [Illustration: 100.jpg SHUA, KING OF GILZAN, BRINGING A WAR-HORSE FULLY  CAPARISONED TO SHALMANESER]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs on the       Black Obelisk.    He made his way back to Gilzan, where its king, Shua, brought him  a war-horse fully caparisoned, as a token of homage. Shalmaneser  graciously deigned to receive it, and further exacted from the king the  accustomed contributions of chariot-horses, sheep, and wine, together  with seven dromedaries, whose strange forms amused the gaping crowds of  Nineveh. After quitting Gilzan, Shalmaneser encountered the people of  Khubushkia, who ventured to bar his way; but its king, Kakia, lost his  city of Shilaia, and three thousand soldiers, besides bulls, horses, and  sheep innumerable. Having enforced submission in Khubushkia, Shalmaneser  at length returned to Assur through the defiles of Kirruri, and came to  Calah to enjoy a well-earned rest after the fatigues of his campaign.    [Illustration: 101.jpg DROMEDARIES FROM GILZAN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs on the       bronze gates of Balawat.    But Akhuni had not yet lost heart. Though driven back to the right bank  of the Euphrates, he had taken advantage of the diversion created by  Arame in his favour, to assume a strong position among the hills of  Shitamrat with the river in his rear.*         * The position of Shitamrat may answer to the ruins of the       fortress of Rum-kaleh, which protected a ford of the       Euphrates in Byzantine times.    Shalmaneser attacked his lines in front, and broke through them after  three days' preliminary skirmishing; then finding the enemy drawn up in  battle array before their last stronghold, the king charged without  a moment's hesitation, drove them back and forced them to surrender.  Akhuni's life was spared, but he was sent with the remainder of his army  to colonise a village in the neighbourhood of Assur, and Adini became  henceforth an integral part of Assyria.    [Illustration: 102.jpg TRIBUTE FROM GILZAN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs on the       Black Obelisk.    The war on the western frontier was hardly brought to a close when  another broke out in the opposite direction. The king rapidly crossed  the pass of Bunagishlu and fell upon Mazamua: the natives, disconcerted  by his impetuous onslaught, nevertheless hoped to escape by putting  out in their boats on the broad expanse of Lake Urumiah. Shalmaneser,  however, constructed rafts of inflated skins, on which his men ventured  in pursuit right out into the open. The natives were overpowered; the  king \"dyed the sea with their blood as if it had been wool,\" and did not  withdraw until he had forced them to appeal for mercy.    In five years Shalmaneser had destroyed Adini, laid low Urartu, and  confirmed the tributary states of Syria in their allegiance; but  Damascus and Babylon were as yet untouched, and the moment was at hand  when he would have to choose between an arduous conflict with them, or  such a repression of the warlike zeal of his opening years, that, like  his father Assur-nazir-pal, he would have to repose on his laurels.  Shalmaneser was too deeply imbued with the desire for conquest to choose  a peaceful policy: he decided at once to assume the offensive against  Damascus, being probably influenced by the news of Ahab's successes, and  deeming that if the King of Israel had gained the ascendency unaided,  Assur, fully confident of its own superiority, need have no fear as  to the result of a conflict. The forces, however, at the disposal of  Benhadad II. (Adadidri) were sufficient to cause the Assyrians some  uneasiness. The King of Damascus was not only lord of Coele-Syria and  the Hauran, but he exercised a suzerainty more or less defined over  Hamath, Israel, Ammon, the Arabian and Idumean tribes, Arvad and the  principalities of Northern Phoenicia, Usanata, Shianu, and Irkanata;* in  all, twelve peoples or twelve kings owned his sway, and their forces,  if united to his, would provide at need an army of nearly 100,000 men:  a few years might see these various elements merged in a united empire,  capable of withstanding the onset of any foreign foe.**         * Irkanata, the Egyptian Arqanatu, perhaps the Irqata of the       Tel-el-A marna tablets, is the Arka of Phoenicia. The other       countries enumerated are likewise situated in the same       locality. Shianu (for a long time read as Shizanu), the Sin       of the Bible (Gen. x. 17), is mentioned by Tiglath-pileser       III. under the name Sianu. Ushanat is called Uznu by       Tiglath-pileser, and Delitzsch thought it represented the       modern Kalaat-el-Hosu. With Arvad it forms the ancient Zahi       of the Egyptians, which was then subject to Damascus.         ** The suzerainty of Ben-hadad over these twelve peoples is       proved by the way in which they are enumerated in the       Assyrian documents: his name always stands at the head of       the list. The manner in which the Assyrian scribes introduce       the names of these kings, mentioning sometimes one,       sometimes two among them, without subtracting them from the       total number 12, has been severely criticised, and Schrader       excused it by saying that 12 is here used as a round number       somewhat vaguely.    Shalmaneser set out from Nineveh on the 14th day of the month Iyyar, 854  B.C., and chastised on his way the Aramaeans of the Balikh, whose sheikh  Giammu had shown some inclination to assert his independence. He crossed  the Euphrates at Tul-harsip, and held a species of durbar at Pitru for  his Syrian subjects: Sangar of Carchemish, Kundashpi of Kummukh, Arame  of Agusi, Lalli of Melitene, Khaiani of Samalla, Garparuda who had  succeeded Shapalulme among the Patina, and a second Garparuda of Gurgum,  rallied around him with their presents of welcome, and probably also  with their troops. This ceremony concluded, he hastened to Khalmaa and  reduced it to submission, then plunged into the hill-country between  Khalman and the Orontes, and swept over the whole territory of Hamath.  A few easy victories at the outset enabled him to exact ransom from, or  burn to the ground, the cities of Adinnu, Mashga, Argana, and Qarqar,  but just beyond Qarqar he encountered the advance-guard of the Syrian  army.*         * The position of these towns is uncertain: the general plan       of the campaign only proves that they must lie on the main       route from Aleppo to Kalaat-Sejar, by Bara or by Maaret-en-       Noman and Kalaat-el-Mudiq. It is agreed that Qarqar must be       sought not far from Hamath, whatever the exact site may be.       An examination of the map shows us that Qarqar corresponds       to the present Kalaat-el-Mudiq, the ancient Apamasa of       Lebanon; the confederate army would command the ford which       led to the plain of Hamath by Kalaat-Sejar.    [Illustration: 105.jpg TRIBUTE FROM GARPARUDA, KING OF THE PATINA]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs on the       Black Obelisk.    Ben-hadad had called together, to give him a fitting reception, the  whole of the forces at his disposal: 1200 chariots, 1200 horse, 20,000  foot-soldiers from Damascus alone; 700 chariots, 700 horse and 10,000  foot from Hamath; 2000 chariots and 10,000 foot belonging to Ahab, 500  soldiers from Kui, 1000 mountaineers from the Taurus,* 10 chariots and  10,000 foot from Irk and 200 from Arvad, 200 from Usanata, 30 chariots  and 10,000 foot from Shianu, 1000 camels from Gindibu the Arab, and 1000  Ammonites.         * The people of the Muzri next enumerated have long been       considered as Egyptians; the juxtaposition of their name       with that of Kui shows that it refers here to the Muzri of       the Taurus.    The battle was long and bloody, and the issue uncertain; Shalmaneser  drove back one wing of the confederate army to the Orontes, and forcing  the other wing and the centre to retire from Qarqar to Kirzau, claimed  the victory, though the losses on both sides were equally great. It  would seem as if the battle were indecisive--the Assyrians, at any  rate, gained nothing by it; they beat a retreat immediately after their  pretended victory, and returned to their own land without prisoners and  almost without booty. On the whole, this first conflict had not been  unfavourable to Damascus: it had demonstrated the power of that state in  the eyes of the most incredulous, and proved how easy resistance  would be, if only the various princes of Syria would lay aside their  differences and all unite under the command of a single chief. The  effect of the battle in Northern Syria and among the recently annexed  Aiamoan tribes was very great; they began to doubt the omnipotence of  Assyria, and their loyalty was shaken. Sangar of Carchemish and the  Khati refused to pay their tribute, and the Emirs of Tul-Abni and Mount  Kashiari broke out into open revolt. Shalmaneser spent a whole year in  suppressing the insurrection; complications, moreover, arose at Babylon  which obliged him to concentrate his attention and energy on Chaldaean  affairs. Nabu-baliddin had always maintained peaceful and friendly  relations with Assyria, but he had been overthrown, or perhaps  assassinated, and his son Marduk-nadin-shumu had succeeded him on the  throne, to the dissatisfaction of a section of his"]]]
