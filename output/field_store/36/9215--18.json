Sec. 71. And when he had consider'd the Properties of Animals, and could  not see any one among them, concerning which he could in the least  suspect that it had any Knowledge of this _necessarily self-existent  Being_; but he knew that his own Essence had the Knowledge of it: He  concluded from hence that he was an Animal, endu'd with a Spirit of an  equal Temperature, as all the Heavenly Bodies are, and that he was of a  distinct Species from the rest of Animals, and that he was created for  another end, and design'd for something greater than what they were  capable of. And this was enough to satisfie him of the Nobility of his  Nature; namely, that his viler Part, _i.e._ the Corporeal, was most like  of all to the Heavenly Substances, which are without this World of  Generation and Corruption, and free from all accidents that cause any  Defect, Change or Alteration: And that his noble Part, _viz._, that by  which he attain'd the Knowledge of the _necessarily self-existent  Being_, was something Heroical and Divine, not subject to Change or  Dissolution, nor capable of being describ'd by any of the Properties or  Attributes of Bodies: Not to be apprehended by any of the Senses, or by  the Imagination; nor to be known by the means of any other Instrument  but it self alone, and that it attains the Knowledge of it self by it  self, and was at once the Knower the Knowledge, and the Thing known, the  Faculty and the Object. Neither was there any difference between any of  these because _Diversity_ and _Separation_ are Properties and Adjuncts  of Bodies; but _Body_ was no way concern'd here, nor any Property or  Adjunct of _Body_.    Sec. 72. Having apprehended the manner by which the being like the Heavenly  Bodies, was peculiar to him above all other kinds of Animals whatever;  he perceiv'd that it was a Duty necessarily incumbent upon him to  resemble them, and imitate their Actions, and endeavour to the utmost to  become like them: He perceiv'd also that in respect: of his nobler Part,  by which he had attain'd the Knowledge of that _necessarily self  existent Being_, he did in some measure resemble it, because he was  separated from the Attributes of Bodies, as the _necessarily  self-existent Being_ is separated from them. He saw also that it was his  Duty to endeavour to make himself Master of the Properties of that Being  by all possible means, and put on his Qualities, and imitate his  Actions, and labour in the doing his Will, and resign himself wholly to  him, and submit to his Dispensations heartily and unfeignedly, so as to  rejoice in him, tho' he should lay Afflictions upon his Body, and hurt,  or totally destroy it.    Sec. 73. He also perceiv'd that he resembled the Beasts in his viler part,  which belong'd to this _Generable_ and _Corruptible_ World, _viz_. this  dark, gross Body, which sollicited him with the Desire of Variety of  sensible Objects, and excited him to eating, drinking, and Copulation;  and he knew that his Body was not created and join'd to him in vain, but  that he was oblig'd to preserve it and take care of it, which he saw  could not be done without some of those Actions which are common to the  rest of the Animals. Thus it was plain to him, that there were three  sorts of Actions which he was obliged to, _viz._ 1. Either those by  which he resembled the Irrational Animals. Or, 2. Those by which he  resembled the Heavenly Bodies. Or, 3. Those by which he resembled the  _necessarily self-existent Being_: And that he was oblig'd to the  _first_, as having a gross Body, consisting of several Parts, and  different Faculties, and variety of Motions. To the _second_, as having  an Animal Spirit, which had its Seat in the Heart, and was the first  beginning of the Body and all its Faculties. To the _third_, as he was  what he was, _viz_. as he was that Being, by which he knew the  _necessarily self-existent Being_. And he was very well assur'd before,  that his Happiness and Freedom from Misery, consisted in the perpetual  Vision of that _necessarily self-existent Being_, without being averted  from it so much as the twinkling of an Eye.    Sec. 74. Then he weigh'd with himself, by what means a Continuation of this  Vision might be attain'd, and the Result of his Contemplation was this,  _viz_. That he was obliged to keep himself constantly exercis'd in these  three kinds of Resemblance. Not that the first of them did any way  contribute to the helping him to the _Vision_(but was rather an  Impediment and Hindrance, because it was concern'd only in sensible  Objects, which are all of them a sort of Veil or Curtain interpos'd  between us and it;) but because it was necessary for the Preservation of  the Animal Spirit, whereby the second Resemblance, which he had with the  Heavenly Bodies was acquir'd, and was for this reason necessary, though  incumbred with Hindrances and Inconveniences. But as to the second  Conformity, he saw indeed that a great share of that continu'd Vision  was attain'd by it, but that it was not without Mixture; because,  whatsoever contemplates the Vision after this manner continually, does,  together with it, have regard to, and call a Look upon his own Essence,  as shall be shewn hereafter. But that the third Conformity was that by  which he obtain'd the pure and entire _Vision_, so as to be wholly taken  up with it, without being diverted from it one way or other, by any  means whatsoever, but being still intent upon that _necessarily  self-existent Being_; which whosoever enjoys, has no regard to any thing  else, and his own Essence is altogether neglected, and vanish'd out of  fight, and become as nothing; and so are all other Essences both great  and small, except only the Essence of that _One, True, Necessarily  Self-existent, High and Powerful Being_.    Sec. 75. Now when he was assur'd that the utmost Bound of all his Desires  consisted in this _third_ Conformity, and that it was not to be  attain'd, without being a long time exercis'd in _the second_; and that  there was no continuing so long as was necessary for that Purpose, but  by means of the _first_; (which, how necessary soever, he knew was an  Hindrance in itself, and an Help only by Accident.) He resolved to allow  himself no more of that first Conformity than needs must, which was only  just so much as would keep the Animal Spirit alive. Now, in order to  this, he found there were two Things necessary; The former, to help it  inwardly, and supply the Defect of that Nourishment which was wasted;  The latter, to preserve it from without, against the Extremities of Heat  and Cold, Rain and Sun, hurtful Animals, and such like; and he  perceiv'd, that if he should allow himself to use these things, though  necessary, unadvisedly and at Adventure, it might chance to expose him  to Excess, and by that means he might do 'himself an Injury unawares;  whereupon he concluded it the safest way to set Bounds to himself, which  he resolv'd not to pass; both as to the Kind of Meat which he was to  eat, and the Quantity and Quality of it, and the Times of returning to  it.    Sec. 76. And first he consider'd the several Kinds of those things which  were fit to eat; and found that there were three sorts, _viz_. either  such Plants as were not yet come to their full Growth, nor attained to  Perfection, such as are several sorts of green Herbs which are fit to  eat: Or _secondly,_ the Fruits of Trees which were fully ripe, and had  Seed fit for the Production of more of the same Kind (and such were the  kinds of Fruits that were newly gathered and dry): Or _lastly_, Living  Creatures, both Fish and Flesh. Now he knew very well, that all these  things were created by that _necessarily self-existent Being_, in  approaching to whom he was assur'd that his Happiness did consist, and  in desiring to resemble him. Now the eating of these things must needs  hinder their attaining to their Perfection, and deprive them of that End  for which they were design'd; and this would be an Opposition to the  working of the Supream Agent, and such an Opposition would hinder that  Nearness and Conformity to him, which he so much desir'd. Upon this he  thought it the best way to abstain from eating altogether, if possible;  but when he saw that this would not do, and that such an Abstinence  tended to the Dissolution of his Body, which was so much a greater  Opposition to the _Agent_ than the former, by how much he was of a more  excellent Nature than those things, whose Destruction was the Cause of  his Preservation: Of two Evils he resolved to chuse the least, and do  that which contain'd in it the least Opposition to the Creator; and  resolved to partake of any of these sorts, if those he had most mind to  were not at hand, in such quantity as he should conclude upon hereafter;  and if it so happen'd that he had them all at hand, then he would  consider with himself, and chuse that, in the partaking of which there  would be the least Opposition to the Work of the Creator: Such as the  pulp of those Fruits which were full ripe, and had Seeds in them fit to  produce others of the like kind, always taking care to preserve the  Seeds, and neither cut them, nor spoil them, nor throw them in such  places as were not fit for Plants to grow in, as smooth Stones, salt  Earth, and the like. And if such pulpy Fruits, as Apples, Pears, Plumbs,  &c. could not easily be come at, he would then take such as had nothing  in them fit to eat but only the Seed, as Almonds and Chesnuts, or such  green Herbs as were young and tender; always observing this Rule, that  let him take of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16847"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (#16)"],[1,"azawin, a chronicle which was not original but incorporated and  superseded other works of the same kind. In his reign arose a question  as to the validity of grants of land, etc., for religious purposes. It  was decided in the sense most favourable to the order, _viz._ that  such grants are perpetual and are not invalidated by the lapse of  time. About 1845 there was a considerable output of vernacular  literature. The Digha, Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas with their  commentaries were translated into Burmese but no compositions in Pali  are recorded.    From 1852 till 1877 Burma was ruled by Mindon-min, who if not a  national hero was at least a pious, peace-loving, capable king. His  chaplain, Pannasami, composed the Sasanavamsa, or ecclesiastical  history of Burma, and the king himself was ambitious to figure as a  great Buddhist monarch, though with more sanity than Bodopaya, for his  chief desire was to be known as the Convener of the Fifth Buddhist  Council. The body so styled met from 1868 to 1871 and, like the  ancient Sangitis, proceeded to recite the Tipitaka in order to  establish the correct text. The result may still be seen at Mandalay  in the collection of buildings commonly known as the four hundred and  fifty Pagodas: a central Stupa surrounded by hundreds of small shrines  each sheltering a perpendicular tablet on which a portion of this  veritable bible in stone is inscribed. Mindon-min also corrected the  growing laxity of the Bhikkhus, and the esteem in which the Burmese  church was held at this time is shown by the fact that the monks of  Ceylon sent a deputation to the Sangharaja of Mandalay referring to  his decision a dispute about a _sima_ or ecclesiastical boundary.    Mindon-min was succeeded by Thibaw, who was deposed by the  British. The Sangharaja maintained his office until he died in  1895. An interregnum then occurred for the appointment had always been  made by the king, not by the Sangha. But when Lord Curzon visited  Burma in 1901 he made arrangements for the election by the monks  themselves of a superior of the whole order and Taunggwin Sayadaw was  solemnly installed in this office by the British authorities in 1903  with the title of Thathanabaing.[167]    3      We may now examine briefly some sides of popular religion and  institutions which are not Buddhist. It is an interesting fact that  the Burmese law books or Dhammathats,[168] which are still accepted as  regulating inheritance and other domestic matters, are Indian in  origin and show no traces of Sinhalese influence although since 1750  there has been a decided tendency to bring them into connection with  authorities accepted by Buddhism. The earliest of these codes are  those of Dhammavilasa (1174 A.D.) and of Waguru, king of Martaban in  1280. They professedly base themselves on the authority of Manu and,  so far as purely legal topics are concerned, correspond pretty closely  with the rules of the Manava-dharmasastra. But they omit all  prescriptions which involve Brahmanic religious observances such as  penance and sacrifice. Also the theory of punishment is different and  inspired by the doctrine of Karma, namely, that every evil deed will  bring its own retribution. Hence the Burmese codes ordain for every  crime not penalties to be suffered by the criminal but merely the  payment of compensation to the party aggrieved, proportionate to the  damage suffered.[169] It is probable that the law-books on which these  codes were based were brought from the east coast of India and  were of the same type as the code of Narada, which, though of  unquestioned Brahmanic orthodoxy, is almost purely legal and has  little to say about religion. A subsidiary literature embodying local  decisions naturally grew up, and about 1640 was summarized by a  Burmese nobleman called Kaing-za in the Maharaja-dhammathat. He  received from the king the title of Manuraja and the name of Manu  became connected with his code, though it is really based on local  custom. It appears to have superseded older law-books until the reign  of Alompra who remodelled the administration and caused several codes  to be compiled.[170] These also preserve the name of Manu, but he and  Kaing-za are treated as the same personage. The rules of the older  law-books are in the main retained but are made to depend on Buddhist  texts. Later Dhammathats become more and more decidedly Buddhist. Thus  the Mohavicchedani (1832) does not mention Manu but presents the  substance of the Manu Dhammathats as the law preached by the Buddha.    Direct Indian influence may be seen in another department not  unimportant in an oriental country. The court astrologers, soothsayers  and professors of kindred sciences were even in recent times Brahmans,  known as Ponna and mostly from Manipur. An inscription found at Pagan  and dated 1442 mentions the gift of 295 books[171] to the Sangha among  which several have Sanskrit titles and about 1600 we hear of Pandits  learned in the Vedasastras, meaning not Vedic learning in the  strict sense but combinations of science and magic described as  medicine, astronomy, Kamasastras, etc. Hindu tradition was  sufficiently strong at the Court to make the presence of experts in  the Atharva Veda seem desirable and in the capital they were in  request for such services as drawing up horoscopes[172] and  invoking good luck at weddings whereas monks will not attend  social gatherings.    More important as a non-Buddhist element in Burmese religion is the  worship of Nats[173] or spirits of various kinds. Of the prevalence of  such worship there is no doubt, but I cannot agree with the  authorities who say that it is the practical religion of the Burmese.  No passing tourist can fail to see that in the literal as well as  figurative sense Burma takes its colour from Buddhism, from the gilded  and vermilion pagodas and the yellow robed priests. It is impossible  that so much money should be given, so many lives dedicated to a  religion which had not a real hold on the hearts of the people. The  worship of Nats, wide-spread though it be, is humble in its outward  signs and is a superstition rather than a creed. On several occasions  the kings of Burma have suppressed its manifestations when they became  too conspicuous. Thus Anawrata destroyed the Nat houses of Pagan and  recent kings forbade the practice of firing guns at funerals to scare  the evil spirits.    Nats are of at least three classes, or rather have three origins.  Firstly they are nature spirits, similar to those revered in China and  Tibet. They inhabit noticeable natural features of every kind,  particularly trees, rivers and mountains; they may be specially  connected with villages, houses or individuals. Though not essentially  evil they are touchy and vindictive, punishing neglect or discourtesy  with misfortune and ill-luck. No explanation is offered as to the  origin of many Nats, but others, who may be regarded as forming the  second category, are ghosts or ancestral spirits. In northern Burma  Chinese influence encouraged ancestor worship, but apart from this  there is a disposition (equally evident in India) to believe that  violent and uncanny persons and those who meet with a tragic death  become powerful ghosts requiring propitiation. Thirdly, there are Nats  who are at least in part identified with the Indian deities recognized  by early Buddhism. It would seem that the Thirty Seven Nats, described  in a work called the Mahagita Medanigyan, correspond to the Thirty  Three Gods of Buddhist mythology, but that the number has been raised  for unknown reasons to 37.[174] They are spirits of deceased  heroes, and there is nothing unbuddhist in this conception, for the  Pitakas frequently represent deserving persons as being reborn in  the Heaven of the Thirty Three. The chief is Thagya, the Sakra or  Indra of Hindu mythology,[175] but the others are heroes, connected  with five cycles of legends based on a popular and often inaccurate  version of Burmese history.[176]    Besides Thagya Nat we find other Indian figures such as Man Nat (Mara)  and Byamma Nat (Brahma). In diagrams illustrating the Buddhist  cosmology of the Burmans[177] a series of heavens is depicted,  ascending from those of the Four Kings and Thirty Three Gods up to the  Brahma worlds, and each inhabited by Nats according to their degree.  Here the spirits of Burma are marshalled and classified according to  Buddhist system just as were the spirits of India some centuries  before. But neither in ancient India nor in modern Burma have the  devas or Nats anything to do with the serious business of religion.  They have their place in temples as guardian genii and the whole band  may be seen in a shrine adjoining the Shwe-zi-gon Pagoda at Pagan, but  this interferes no more with the supremacy of the Buddha than did the  deputations of spirits who according to the scriptures waited on him.    4      Buddhism is a real force in Burmese life and the pride of the Burmese  people. Every male Burman enters a monastery when he is about 15 for a  short stay. Devout parents send their sons for the four months of  _Was_ (or even for this season during three successive years), but by  the majority a period of from one month to one week is considered  sufficient. To omit this stay in a monastery altogether would not be  respectable: it is in common esteem the only way to become a human  being, for without it a boy is a mere animal. The praises of the  Buddha and vows to lead a good life are commonly recited by the  laity[178] every morning and evening. It is the greatest ambition of  most Burmans to build a pagoda and those who are able to do so (a  large percentage of the population to judge from the number of  buildings) are not only sure of their reward in another birth but  even now enjoy respect and receive the title of pagoda-builder.  Another proof of devotion is the existence of thousands of  monasteries--[179"]]]
