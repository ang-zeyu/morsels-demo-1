I named the harbour Port Resolution, after  the ship, she being the first which ever entered it. It is situated on the  north side of the most eastern point of the island, and about E.N.E. from  the volcano; in the latitude of 19 deg. 32' 25\" 1/2 S., and in the longitude of  169 deg. 44' 35\" E. It is no more than a little creek running in S. by W. 1/2  W. three quarters of a mile, and is about half that in breadth. A shoal of  sand and rocks, lying on the east side, makes it still narrower. The depth  of water in the harbour is from six to three fathoms, and the bottom is  sand and mud. No place can be more convenient for taking in wood and water;  for both are close to the shore. The water stunk a little after it had been  a few days on board, but it afterwards turned sweet; and even when it was  at the worst, the tin machine would, in a few hours, recover a whole cask.  This is an excellent contrivance for sweetening water at sea, and is well  known in the navy.    Mr Wales, from whom I had the latitude and longitude, found the variation  of the needle to be 7 deg. 14' 12\" E., and the dip of its south end 45 deg. 2' 3/4.  He also observed the time of high water, on the full and change days, to be  about 5h 45m; and the tide to rise and fall three feet.    CHAPTER VII.    _The Survey of the Islands continued, and a more particular Description  of them._    1774 August    As soon as the boats were hoisted in, we made sail, and stretched to the  eastward, with a fresh gale at S.E., in order to have a nearer view of  Erronan, and to see if there was any land in its neighbourhood. We stood on  till midnight, when, having passed the island, we tacked, and spent the  remainder of the night making two boards. At sun-rise on the 21st, we stood  S.W., in order to get to the south of Tanna, and nearer to Annatom, to  observe if any more land lay in that direction; for an extraordinary clear  morning had produced no discovery of any to the east. At noon, having  observed in latitude 20 deg. 33' 30\", the situation of the lands around us was  as follows: Port Resolution bore north 86 deg. W., distant six and a half  leagues; the island of Tanna extended from S. 88 deg. W., to N. 64 deg. W.;  Traitor's Head N. 58 deg. W., distant twenty leagues; the island of Erronan N.  80 deg. E., distant five leagues; and Annatom from S. 1/2 E. to S. 1/2 W.,  distant ten leagues. We continued to stretch to the south till two o'clock  p.m. when, seeing no more land before us, we bore up round the S.E. end of  Tanna; and, with a fine gale at E.S.E., ran along the south coast at one  league from shore. It seemed a bold one, without the guard of any rocks;  and the country full as fertile as in the neighbourhood of the harbour, and  making a fine appearance. At six o'clock the high land of Erromango  appeared over the west end of Tanna in the direction of 10 deg. W.; at eight  o'clock we were past the island, and steered N.N.W. for Sandwich Island, in  order to finish the survey* of it, and of the isles to the N.W. On the  22d, at four o'clock p.m., we drew near the S.E. end, and ranging the south  coast, found it to trend in the direction of W. and W.N.W. for about nine  leagues. Near the middle of this length, and close to the shore, are three  or four small isles, behind which seemed to be a safe anchorage. But not  thinking I had any time to spare to visit this fine island, I continued to  range the coast to its western extremity, and then steered N.N.W, from the  S.E. end of Mallicollo, which, at half past six o'clock next morning, bore  N. 14 deg. E., distant seven or eight leagues, and Three-Hills Island S. 82 deg.  E. Soon after, we saw the islands Apee, Paom, and Ambrym. What we had  comprehended under the name of Paom appeared now to be two isles, something  like a separation being seen between the hill and the land to the west of  it. We approached the S.W. side of Mallicollo to within half a league, and  ranged it at that distance. From the S.E. point, the direction of the land  is west, a little southerly, for six or seven leagues, and then N.W. by W.  three leagues, to a pretty high point or head-land, situated in latitude  16 deg. 29', and which obtained the name of South-west Cape. The coast, which  is low, seemed to be indented into creeks and projecting points; or else,  these points were small isles lying under the shore. We were sure of one,  which lies between two and three leagues east of the Cape. Close to the  west side or point of the Cape, lies, connected with it by breakers, a  round rock or islet, which helps to shelter a fine bay, formed by an elbow  in the coast, from the reigning winds.    [* The word Survey is not here to be understood in its literal sense.  Surveying a place, according to my idea, is taking a geometrical plan  of it, in which every place is to have its true situation, which  cannot be done in a work of this nature.]    The natives appeared in troops on many parts of the shore, and some seemed  desirous to come off to us in canoes, but they did not; and, probably, our  not shortening sail, was the reason. From the South-west Cape, the  direction of the coast is N. by W.; but the most advanced land bore from it  N.W. by N., at which the land seemed to terminate. Continuing to follow the  direction of the coast, at noon it was two miles from us; and our latitude,  by observation, was 16 deg. 22' 30\" S. This is nearly the parallel to Port  Sandwich, and our never-failing guide, the watch, shewed that we were 26'  west of it; a distance which the breadth of Mallicollo cannot exceed in  this parallel. The South-east Cape bore S. 26 deg. E., distant seven miles; and  the most advanced point of land, for which we steered, bore N.W. by N. At  three o'clock, we were the length of it, and found the land continued, and  trending more and more to the north. We coasted it to its northern  extremity, which we did not reach till after dark, at which time we were  near enough to the shore to hear the voices of people, who were assembled  round a fire they had made on the beach. There we sounded, and found twenty  fathoms and a bottom of sand; but, on edging off from the shore, we soon  got out of sounding, and then made a trip back to the south till the moon  got up. After this we stood again to the north, hauled round the point, and  spent the night in Bougainville's passage; being assured of our situation  before sun-set, by seeing the land, on the north side of the passage,  extending as far as N.W. 1/2 W.    The south coast of Mallicollo, from the S.E. end to the S.W. Cape, is  luxuriantly clothed with wood, and other productions of nature, from the  sea-shore to the very summits of the hills. To the N.W. of the Cape the  country is less woody, but more agreeably interspersed with lawns, some of  which appeared to be cultivated. The summits of the hills seemed barren;  and the highest lies between Port Sandwich and the S.W. Cape. Farther north  the land falls insensibly lower, and is less covered with wood. I believe  it is a very fertile island, and well inhabited; for we saw smoke by day  and fire by night, in all parts of it.    Next morning at sun-rise, we found ourselves nearly in the middle of the  passage, the N.W. end of Mallicollo extending from S. 30 deg. E., to S. 58 deg. W.;  the land to the north from N. 70 deg. W. to N. 4 deg. E.; and the Isle of Lepers  bearing N. 30 deg. E., distant eleven or twelve leagues. We now made sail, and  steered N. by E., and afterwards north, along the east coast of the  northern land, with a fine breeze at S.E. We found that this coast, which  at first appeared to be continued, was composed of several low woody isles,  the most of them of small extent, except the southernmost, which, on  account of the day, I named St Bartholomew. It is six or seven leagues in  circuit, and makes the N.E. point of Bougainville's Passage. At noon the  breeze began to slacken. We were at this time between two and three miles  from the land, and observed in latitude 15 deg. 23' the Isle of Lepers bearing  from E. by N. to S., distance seven leagues; and a high bluff-head, at  which the coast we were upon seemed to terminate, N.N.W. 1/2 W., distant  ten or eleven leagues; but from the mast-head we could see land to the  east. This we judged to be an island, and it bore N. by W. 1/2 W.    As we advanced to N.N.W., along a fine coast covered with woods, we  perceived low land that extended off from the bluff-head towards the island  above mentioned, but did not seem to join it. It was my intention to have  gone through the channel, but the approach of night made me lay it aside,  and steer without the island. During the afternoon, we passed some small  isles lying under the shore; and observed some projecting points of unequal  height, but were not able to determine whether or no they were connected  with the main land. Behind them was a ridge of hills which terminated at  the bluff-head. There were cliffs, in some places of the coast, and white  patches, which we judged to be chalk. At ten o'clock, being the length of  the isle which lies off the head, we shortened sail, and spent the night in  making short boards.    At day-break on the 25th, we were on the north side of the island (which is  of a moderate height, and three leagues in circuit,) and steered west for  the bluff-head, along the low land under it. At sun-rise an elevated coast  came in sight beyond the bluff-head, extending to the north as far N.W. by  W. After doubling the head we found the land to trend south, a little  easterly, and to form a large deep bay, bounded on the west by the coast  just mentioned.    Every thing conspired to make us believe this was the Bay of St Philip and  St Jago, discovered by Quiros in 1606.

It was in the summer and a Hopi hoeing his field  was killed by a bunch of thieving Navajos, and that started the trouble.  This man who was killed had a crippled nephew working with him at the  time, and that boy got away and ran back to Walpi with the word, and  everybody was surprised that he could run fast enough to get away.    \"After that they made him a watchman to look out for Navajos.    \"A good while after that two Hopi boys were fired upon by prowling  Navajos who were hiding in the village of Sichomovi. For a number of  years then the Navajos plundered the fields, drove off the stock, and  killed children. Then they stopped coming here for a good while, but  later they began doing all those things again, worse than ever. So then  the Hopi decided to shoot every Navajo they saw in their fields, and  this stopped the trouble.    \"Now the Navajos are good friends, come here often, and bring meat.\"      =The Coyote and the Water Plume Snake,= by Dawavantsie    \"Once upon a time a Coyote and a Water Plume Snake got acquainted. One  day the Coyote invited his friend, the big snake, to come and visit him  at his house. The Snake was pleased to be invited, so he went that very  night.    \"The Coyote was at home waiting, and when his guest arrived, he told him  to come right in. So the Snake started in, first his head, then his long  body, and more and more of him kept coming in, so that the Coyote had to  keep crowding over against the wall to make room. By the time the Snake  was in, tail and all, the Coyote had to go up and stay outside, for his  visitor took up all the room in his house.    \"Now the Coyote could still put his head close to his door and visit  with the Snake, so that they had a very good visit. But that night was  pretty cold, and after while the Coyote was so cold he got cross and  wished the Snake would go home.    \"Well, by and by, the Snake said he must go home now, so he said  goodnight and invited the Coyote to come over to his house the next  night.    \"The Coyote said he would be sure to come over, then he went into his  house and sat by the fire and got warm and made plans how he would get  even with that big Water Plume Snake.    \"Well, next day he went and gathered a lot of cedar bark and some corn  husks and some pine gum, and he made himself a great long tail and put  lots of wool and some of his hair on the outside, so that it was a very  big tail and long, too.    \"So when evening came, he waited for it to get dark, then he started for  the kiva of the big Snake.    \"When he got there his friend was waiting and had a nice fire and  received him with good welcome and told him to come right in and get  warm.    \"Now the Water Plume Snake was sure surprised when the Coyote got in and  kept going round and round, pulling his long tail after him, and being  wise he saw just what was going on, and now he knows the Coyote is  making fun of him. So he just says nothing and makes room enough for the  Coyote by going outdoors himself.    \"So the Snake just put his head in and was very nice and polite and they  have a good visit. But the Snake got very cold and still the Coyote will  not go home and the Snake is nearly freezing.    \"At last the Coyote says he have to go and the Snake is pretty cold and  pretty mad, too. So he says good night to the Coyote and crawls right  down into his house quick as the Coyote's body is out, and when he sees  all that big tail rolling out he just holds the end of it over the  fireplace and gets it burning.    \"But the Coyote is very pleased with himself and he don't look back but  just goes right along. After a while he notices a fire behind him and  turns around and sees the grass is burning way back there. So he says to  himself, 'Well I better not go into my house for the Hopi have set fire  to the grass to drive me away, and I'll just go on, so they won't find  me at home.'    \"But soon the fire got going fast in that cedar bark and before he can  get that tail untied he is burned so bad that he just keeps running till  he gets to Bayupa (Little Colorado River). There was a great flood going  down the river and he was so weak from running that he could not swim,  so he drowned. And that is what he got for trying to get even with  somebody.\"    Quentin Quahongva, who tells the next story, lives at Shungopovi,  Second Mesa. He is a good-natured, easy-going man of middle age, and  usually surrounded by a troop of children, his own and all the  neighbors'.    [Illustration: Figure 15.--Quahongva, Story-teller of Shungopovi, and  Listeners.]    We had no more than started our first story when the youngsters began to  appear. They squatted about on the floor and covered the door step, and  were good listeners. Their squeals of glee brought other children  scampering, as the story-teller imitated the song and dance steps of the  Eagle, in one of his stories. But the one we have chosen to record here  is a Bear story. Figure 15 shows Quahongva surrounded by those of the  children who had not been called home to supper when the stories ended.  One small girl in the foreground is carrying her doll on her back by  means of her little shawl, exactly as her mother carries her baby  brother.    Quahongva was a good story-teller. Some of his tales were long enough to  occupy an evening. His best story took two and a half days for the  telling and recording, so can not be included here.      =A Bear Story,= as told by Quahongva    \"Long ago at Shipaulovi there lived a woman with her husband and two  little children, two and four years old. The husband died. For a long  time the woman stayed alone and had to do all the work herself, bring  wood and make the fire and everything.    \"One day she went to a little mesa a good ways off for wood, for there  was dry wood in that place. One of the children wanted to go with her  and cried, but the mother could not take her, she was too little. So she  told her to stay at home and play and watch for her return.    \"The two little ones were playing 'slide down' on a smooth, slanting  rock, and from quite a distance the mother looked back and saw them  still playing there. Then she went around a little hill to find her  wood.    \"She gathered a big bunch and tied it up, making a kind of rack that she  could carry on her back. Now she leaned her load up on a big rock so she  could lift it to her back, and as she turned around just ready to take  up the load, she saw a bear coming. She was terribly frightened and just  stood still, and the bear came closer and made big noise. (Note: A good  imitation was given, and the children listeners first laughed and then  became comically sober. H.G.L.)    \"She said, 'Poor me, where shall I hide! What am I going to do!'    \"She was so frightened she could not think where to go; but now she saw  a crevice under the rock where she was leaning, so she crawled in and  put the rack of wood in front of her.    \"From behind the wood she could still see the bear coming and hear his  great voice. Soon he reached the rock and tore the wood away with his  great paws. Then he reached in and pulled the woman out and ripped her  open with his terrible claws and tore her heart out and ate it up.    \"By this time the sun was nearly down; it was soon dark and the poor  children were still waiting for their mother just where she had left  them, but she never returned. Some one came to them and asked, 'What are  you doing here?'    \"'We are watching for our mother, who went for wood, and we are waiting  for her,' they said.    \"'But why does she not come when it is so late?' they said. Then they  said, 'Let's all go home; something must have happened.' So they took  the children home with them and sent some others to look for the mother.    \"They followed her tracks and found the place, the mother dead, and her  heart gone. So they came back home in the dark night.    \"Next day, they returned to the place and followed the bear tracks to  the woods where his home was, but never found the bear. So they went  home.    \"The poor little children were very lonely and not treated very well by  the neighbors, and both children died, first the younger, and then the  older; and this is a true story.\" (Note: One could well imagine from the  faces of the young listeners that something like a resolution to stay  pretty close around home was passing unanimously. H.G.L.)           *       *       *       *       *    Don Talayesva of Upper Oraibi was the only one of my story-tellers who  spoke without the aid of an interpreter. He is a tall, good-looking man  of less than forty, with an expressive face and a pair of merry dark  eyes that hold a prophesy of the rich sense of humor one soon discovers  in both his conversation and his stories.    This particular tale rather gives away some state secrets as to how Hopi  children are persuaded to be good, and Don chuckled and paused to lower  his voice and see that his own small son was out of hearing, when  explaining certain parts of the story.      =The Giant and the Twin War Gods,= as told by Don Talayesva    \"Well, once upon a time more people lived here in Old Oraibi--many  people, many, many children, and the children getting pretty bad. People  tried every way to punish and correct them and at last the head governor  got tired of this business, and so he thought of best way to fix them.  They were all time throwing stones at the old people and pinning rags on  the back of somebody and don't mind their parents very good.    \"Now this head governor is very powerful and very wise.
