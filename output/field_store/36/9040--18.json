The word, taken by itself, means a manly or plucky fellow.           *       *       *       *       *    Chobei of Bandzuin was the chief of the Otokodate of Yedo. He was  originally called Itaro, and was the son of a certain Ronin who lived  in the country. One day, when he was only ten years of age, he went  out with a playfellow to bathe in the river; and as the two were  playing they quarrelled over their game, and Itaro, seizing the other  boy, threw him into the river and drowned him.    Then he went home, and said to his father--    \"I went to play by the river to-day, with a friend; and as he was rude  to me, I threw him into the water and killed him.\"    When his father heard him speak thus, quite calmly, as if nothing had  happened, he was thunderstruck, and said--    \"This is indeed a fearful thing. Child as you are, you will have to  pay the penalty of your deed; so to-night you must fly to Yedo in  secret, and take service with some noble Samurai, and perhaps in time  you may become a soldier yourself.\"    With these words he gave him twenty ounces of silver and a fine sword,  made by the famous swordsmith Rai Kunitoshi, and sent him out of the  province with all dispatch. The following morning the parents of the  murdered child came to claim that Itaro should be given up to their  vengeance; but it was too late, and all they could do was to bury  their child and mourn for his loss.    Itaro made his way to Yedo in hot haste, and there found employment as  a shop-boy; but soon tiring of that sort of life, and burning to  become a soldier, he found means at last to enter the service of a  certain Hatamoto called Sakurai Shozayemon, and changed his name to  Tsunehei. Now this Sakurai Shozayemon had a son, called Shonosuke, a  young man in his seventeenth year, who grew so fond of Tsunehei that  he took him with him wherever he went, and treated him in all ways as  an equal.    When Shonosuke went to the fencing-school Tsunehei would accompany  him, and thus, as he was by nature strong and active, soon became a  good swordsman.    One day, when Shozayemon had gone out, his son Shonosuke said to  Tsunehei--    \"You know how fond my father is of playing at football: it must be  great sport. As he has gone out to-day, suppose you and I have a  game?\"    \"That will be rare sport,\" answered Tsunehei. \"Let us make haste and  play, before my lord comes home.\"    So the two boys went out into the garden, and began trying to kick the  football; but, lacking skill, do what they would, they could not lift  it from the ground. At last Shonosuke, with a vigorous kick, raised  the football; but, having missed his aim, it went tumbling over the  wall into the next garden, which belonged to one Hikosaka Zempachi, a  teacher of lance exercise, who was known to be a surly, ill-tempered  fellow.    \"Oh, dear! what shall we do?\" said Shonosuke. \"We have lost my  father's football in his absence; and if we go and ask for it back  from that churlish neighbour of ours, we shall only be scolded and  sworn at for our pains.\"    \"Oh, never mind,\" answered Tsunehei; \"I will go and apologize for our  carelessness, and get the football back.\"    \"Well, but then you will be chidden, and I don't want that.\"    \"Never mind me. Little care I for his cross words.\" So Tsunehei went  to the next-door house to reclaim the ball.    Now it so happened that Zempachi, the surly neighbour, had been  walking in his garden whilst the two youths were playing; and as he  was admiring the beauty of his favourite chrysanthemums, the football  came flying over the wall and struck him full in the face. Zempachi,  not used to anything but flattery and coaxing, flew into a violent  rage at this; and while he was thinking how he would revenge himself  upon any one who might be sent to ask for the lost ball, Tsunehei came  in, and said to one of Zempachi's servants--    \"I am sorry to say that in my lord's absence I took his football, and,  in trying to play with it, clumsily kicked it over your wall. I beg  you to excuse my carelessness, and to be so good as to give me back  the ball.\"    The servant went in and repeated this to Zempachi, who worked himself  up into a great rage, and ordered Tsunehei to be brought before him,  and said--    \"Here, fellow, is your name Tsunehei?\"    \"Yes, sir, at your service. I am almost afraid to ask pardon for my  carelessness; but please forgive me, and let me have the ball.\"    \"I thought your master, Shozayemon, was to blame for this; but it  seems that it was you who kicked the football.\"    \"Yes, sir. I am sure I am very sorry for what I have done. Please, may  I ask for the ball?\" said Tsunehei, bowing humbly.    For a while Zempachi made no answer, but at length he said--    \"Do you know, villain, that your dirty football struck me in the  face? I ought, by rights, to kill you on the spot for this; but I will  spare your life this time, so take your football and be off.\" And with  that he went up to Tsunehei and beat him, and kicked him in the head,  and spat in his face.    Then Tsunehei, who up to that time had demeaned himself very humbly,  in his eagerness to get back the football, jumped up in a fury, and  said--    \"I made ample apologies to you for my carelessness, and now you have  insulted and struck me. Ill-mannered ruffian! take back the  ball,--I'll none of it;\" and he drew his dirk, and cutting the  football in two, threw it at Zempachi, and returned home.    But Zempachi, growing more and more angry, called one of his servants,  and said to him--    \"That fellow, Tsunehei, has been most insolent: go next door and find  out Shozayemon, and tell him that I have ordered you to bring back  Tsunehei, that I may kill him.\"    So the servant went to deliver the message.    In the meantime Tsunehei went back to his master's house; and when  Shonosuke saw him, he said--    \"Well, of course you have been ill treated; but did you get back the  football?\"    \"When I went in, I made many apologies; but I was beaten, and kicked  in the head, and treated with the greatest indignity. I would have  killed that wretch, Zempachi, at once, but that I knew that, if I did  so while I was yet a member of your household, I should bring trouble  upon your family. For your sake I bore this ill-treatment patiently;  but now I pray you let me take leave of you and become a Ronin, that I  may be revenged upon this man.\"    \"Think well what you are doing,\" answered Shonosuke. \"After all, we  have only lost a football; and my father will not care, nor upbraid  us.\"    But Tsimehei would not listen to him, and was bent upon wiping out the  affront that he had received. As they were talking, the messenger  arrived from Zempachi, demanding the surrender of Tsunehei, on the  ground that he had insulted him: to this Shonosuke replied that his  father was away from home, and that in his absence he could do  nothing.    At last Shozayemon came home; and when he heard what had happened he  was much grieved, and at a loss what to do, when a second messenger  arrived from Zempachi, demanding that Tsunehei should be given up  without delay. Then Shozayemon, seeing that the matter was serious,  called the youth to him, and said--    \"This Zempachi is heartless and cruel, and if you go to his house will  assuredly kill you; take, therefore, these fifty riyos, and fly to  Osaka or Kioto, where you may safely set up in business.\"    \"Sir,\" answered Tsunehei, with tears of gratitude for his lord's  kindness, \"from my heart I thank you for your great goodness; but I  have been insulted and trampled upon, and, if I lay down my life in  the attempt, I will repay Zempachi for what he has this day done.\"    \"Well, then, since you needs must be revenged, go and fight, and may  success attend you! Still, as much depends upon the blade you carry,  and I fear yours is likely to be but a sorry weapon, I will give you a  sword;\" and with this he offered Tsunehei his own.    \"Nay, my lord,\" replied Tsunehei; \"I have a famous sword, by Rai  Kunitoshi, which my father gave me. I have never shown it to your  lordship, but I have it safely stowed away in my room.\"    When Shozayemon saw and examined the sword, he admired it greatly, and  said, \"This is indeed a beautiful blade, and one on which you may  rely. Take it, then, and bear yourself nobly in the fight; only  remember that Zempachi is a cunning spearsman, and be sure to be very  cautious.\"    So Tsunehei, after thanking his lord for his manifold kindnesses, took  an affectionate leave, and went to Zempachi's house, and said to the  servant--    \"It seems that your master wants to speak to me. Be so good as to take  me to see him.\"    So the servant led him into the garden, where Zempachi, spear in hand,  was waiting to kill him. When Zempachi saw him, he cried out--    \"Ha! so you have come back; and now for your insolence, this day I  mean to kill you with my own hand.\"    \"Insolent yourself!\" replied Tsunehei. \"Beast, and no Samurai! Come,  let us see which of us is the better man.\"    Furiously incensed, Zempachi thrust with his spear at Tsunehei; but  he, trusting to his good sword, attacked Zempachi, who, cunning  warrior as he was, could gain no advantage. At last Zempachi, losing  his temper, began fighting less carefully, so that Tsunehei found an  opportunity of cutting the shaft of his spear. Zempachi then drew his  sword, and two of his retainers came up to assist him; but Tsunehei  killed one of them, and wounded Zempachi in the forehead. The second  retainer fled affrighted at the youth's valour, and Zempachi was  blinded by the blood which flowed from the wound on his forehead. Then  Tsunehei said--    \"To kill one who is as a blind man were unworthy a soldier. Wipe the  blood from your eyes, Sir Zempachi, and let us fight it out fairly.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#16)"],[1,"AINTING-IN-MOTION      This chapter is founded on the delicate effects that may be worked out  from cosy interior scenes, close to the camera. It relates directly to  chapter three.    While the Intimate-and-friendly Motion Picture may be in high sculptural  relief, its characteristic manifestations are in low relief. The  situations show to better advantage when they seem to be paintings rather  than monumental groups.    Turn to your handful of motion picture magazines and mark the  illustrations that look the most like paintings. Cut them out. Winnow  them several times. I have before me, as a final threshing from such an  experiment, five pictures. Each one approximates a different school.    Here is a colonial Virginia maiden by the hearth of the inn. Bending over  her in a cherishing way is the negro maid. On the other side, the  innkeeper shows a kindred solicitude. A dishevelled traveller sleeps  huddled up in the corner. The costume of the man fades into the velvety  shadows of the wall. His face is concealed. His hair blends with the soft  background. The clothing of the other three makes a patch of light gray.  Added to this is the gayety of special textures: the turban of the  negress, a trimming on the skirt of the heroine, the silkiness of the  innkeeper's locks, the fabric of the broom in the hearthlight, the  pattern of the mortar lines round the bricks of the hearth. The tableau  is a satisfying scheme in two planes and many textures. Here is another  sort of painting. The young mother in her pretty bed is smiling on her  infant. The cot and covers and flesh tints have gentle scales of  difference, all within one tone of the softest gray. Her hair is quite  dark. It relates to the less luminous black of the coat of the physician  behind the bed and the dress of the girl-friend bending over her. The  nurse standing by the doctor is a figure of the same gray-white as the  bed. Within the pattern of the velvety-blacks there are as many subtle  gradations as in the pattern of the gray-whites. The tableau is a  satisfying scheme in black and gray, with practically one non-obtrusive  texture throughout.    Here is a picture of an Englishman and his wife, in India. It might be  called sculptural, but for the magnificence of the turban of the rajah  who converses with them, the glitter of the light round his shoulders,  and the scheme of shadow out of which the three figures rise. The  arrangement remotely reminds one of several of Rembrandt's semi-oriental  musings.    Here is a picture of Mary Pickford as Fanchon the Cricket. She is in the  cottage with the strange old mother. I have seen a painting in this mood  by the Greek Nickolas Gysis.    The Intimate-and-friendly Moving Picture, the photoplay of  painting-in-motion, need not be indoors as long as it has the  native-heath mood. It is generally keyed to the hearthstone, and keeps  quite close to it. But how well I remember when the first French  photoplays began to come. Though unintelligent in some respects, the  photography and subject-matter of many of them made one think of that  painter of gentle out-of-door scenes, Jean Charles Cazin. Here is our  last clipping, which is also in a spirit allied to Cazin. The heroine,  accompanied by an aged shepherd and his dog, are in the foreground. The  sheep are in the middle distance on the edge of the river. There is a  noble hill beyond the gently flowing water. Here is intimacy and  friendliness in the midst of the big out of doors.    If these five photo-paintings were on good paper enlarged to twenty by  twenty-four inches, they would do to frame and hang on the wall of any  study, for a month or so. And after the relentless test of time, I would  venture that some one of the five would prove a permanent addition to the  household gods.    Hastily made photographs selected from the films are often put in front  of the better theatres to advertise the show. Of late they are making  them two by three feet and sometimes several times larger. Here is a  commercial beginning of an art gallery, but not enough pains are taken to  give the selections a complete art gallery dignity. Why not have the most  beautiful scenes in front of the theatres, instead of those alleged to be  the most thrilling? Why not rest the fevered and wandering eye, rather  than make one more attempt to take it by force?    Let the reader supply another side of the argument by looking at the  illustrations in any history of painting. Let him select the pictures  that charm him most, and think of them enlarged and transferred bodily to  one corner of the room, as he has thought of the sculpture. Let them take  on motion without losing their charm of low relief, or their serene  composition within the four walls of the frame. As for the motion, let it  be a further extension of the drawing. Let every gesture be a bolder but  not less graceful brush-stroke.    The Metropolitan Museum has a Van Dyck that appeals equally to one's sense  of beauty and one's feeling for humor. It is a portrait of James Stuart,  Duke of Lennox, and I cannot see how the author-producer-photographer can  look upon it without having it set his imagination in a glow. Every small  town dancing set has a James like this. The man and the greyhound are the  same witless breed, the kind that achieve a result by their clean-limbed  elegance alone. Van Dyck has painted the two with what might be called a  greyhound brush-stroke, a style of handling that is nothing but courtly  convention and strut to the point of genius. He is as far from the  meditative spirituality of Rembrandt as could well be imagined.    Conjure up a scene in the hereditary hall after a hunt (or golf  tournament), in which a man like this Duke of Lennox has a noble parley  with his lady (or dancing partner), she being a sweet and stupid swan (or  a white rabbit) by the same sign that he is a noble and stupid greyhound.  Be it an ancient or modern episode, the story could be told in the tone  and with well-nigh the brushwork of Van Dyck.    Then there is a picture my teachers, Chase and Henri, were never weary of  praising, the Girl with the Parrot, by Manet. Here continence in nervous  force, expressed by low relief and restraint in tone, is carried to its  ultimate point. I should call this an imagist painting, made before there  were such people as imagist poets. It is a perpetual sermon to those that  would thresh around to no avail, be they orators, melodramatists, or  makers of photoplays with an alleged heart-interest.    Let us consider Gilbert Stuart's portrait of Washington. This painter's  notion of personal dignity has far more of the intellectual quality than  Van Dyck. He loves to give us stately, able, fairly conscientious gentry,  rather than overdone royalty. His work represents a certain mood in  design that in architecture is called colonial. Such portraits go with  houses like Mount Vernon. Let the photographer study the flat blacks in  the garments. Let him note the transparent impression of the laces and  flesh-tints that seem to be painted on glass, observing especially the  crystalline whiteness of the wigs. Let him inspect also the  silhouette-like outlines, noting the courtly self-possession they convey.  Then let the photographer, the producer, and the author, be they one man  or six men, stick to this type of picturization through one entire  production, till any artist in the audience will say, \"This photoplay was  painted by a pupil of Gilbert Stuart\"; and the layman will say, \"It looks  like those stately days.\" And let us not have battle, but a Mount Vernon  fireside tale.    Both the Chicago and New York museums contain many phases of one same  family group, painted by George de Forest Brush. There is a touch of the  hearthstone priestess about the woman. The force of sex has turned to the  austere comforting passion of motherhood. From the children, under the  wings of this spirit, come special delicate powers of life. There is  nothing tense or restless about them, yet they embody action, the beating  of the inner fire, without which all outer action is mockery.  Hearthstone tales keyed to the mood and using the brush stroke that  delineates this especial circle would be unmistakable in their  distinction.    Charles W. Hawthorne has pictures in Chicago and New York that imply the  Intimate-and-friendly Photoplay. The Trousseau in the Metropolitan Museum  shows a gentle girl, an unfashionable home-body with a sweetly sheltered  air. Behind her glimmers the patient mother's face. The older woman is  busy about fitting the dress. The picture is a tribute to the qualities  of many unknown gentlewomen. Such an illumination as this, on faces so  innocently eloquent, is the light that should shine on the countenance of  the photoplay actress who really desires greatness in the field of the  Intimate Motion Picture. There is in Chicago, Hawthorne's painting of  Sylvia: a little girl standing with her back to a mirror, a few blossoms  in one hand and a vase of flowers on the mirror shelf. It is as sound a  composition as Hawthorne ever produced. The painting of the child is  another tribute to the physical-spiritual textures from which humanity is  made. Ah, you producer who have grown squeaky whipping your people into  what you called action, consider the dynamics of these figures that  would be almost motionless in real life. Remember there must be a  spirit-action under the other, or all is dead.    Yet that soul may be the muse of Comedy. If Hawthorne and his kind are  not your fashion, turn to models that have their feet on the earth  always, yet successfully aspire. Key some of your intimate humorous  scenes to the Dutch Little Masters of Painting, such pictures as Gerard  Terburg's Music Lesson in the Chicago Art Institute. The thing is as well  designed as a Dutch house, wind-mill, or clock. And it is more elegant  than any of these. There is humor enough"]]]
