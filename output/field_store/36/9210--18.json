And they shaped  for themselves somehow a dramatic form. \"It's like a story,\" his friends  said when he told his travels. It always was a story.    But the adventure that lay waiting for him where the silent streets of  little Helouan kiss the great Desert's lips, was of a different kind to  any Henriot had yet encountered. Looking back, he has often asked  himself, \"How in the world can I accept it?\"    And, perhaps, he never yet has accepted it. It was sand that brought it.  For the Desert, the stupendous thing that mothers little Helouan,  produced it.          II      He slipped through Cairo with the same relief that he left the Riviera,  resenting its social vulgarity so close to the imperial aristocracy of  the Desert; he settled down into the peace of soft and silent little  Helouan. The hotel in which he had a room on the top floor had been  formerly a Khedivial Palace. It had the air of a palace still. He felt  himself in a country-house, with lofty ceilings, cool and airy  corridors, spacious halls. Soft-footed Arabs attended to his wants;  white walls let in light and air without a sign of heat; there was a  feeling of a large, spread tent pitched on the very sand; and the wind  that stirred the oleanders in the shady gardens also crept in to rustle  the palm leaves of his favourite corner seat. Through the large windows  where once the Khedive held high court, the sunshine blazed upon vistaed  leagues of Desert.    And from his bedroom windows he watched the sun dip into gold and  crimson behind the swelling Libyan sands. This side of the pyramids he  saw the Nile meander among palm groves and tilled fields. Across his  balcony railings the Egyptian stars trooped down beside his very bed,  shaping old constellations for his dreams; while, to the south, he  looked out upon the vast untamable Body of the sands that carpeted the  world for thousands of miles towards Upper Egypt, Nubia, and the dread  Sahara itself. He wondered again why people thought it necessary to go  so far afield to know the Desert. Here, within half an hour of Cairo, it  lay breathing solemnly at his very doors.    For little Helouan, caught thus between the shoulders of the Libyan and  Arabian Deserts, is utterly sand-haunted. The Desert lies all round it  like a sea. Henriot felt he never could escape from it, as he moved  about the island whose coasts are washed with sand. Down each broad and  shining street the two end houses framed a vista of its dim  immensity--glimpses of shimmering blue, or flame-touched purple. There  were stretches of deep sea-green as well, far off upon its bosom. The  streets were open channels of approach, and the eye ran down them as  along the tube of a telescope laid to catch incredible distance out of  space. Through them the Desert reached in with long, thin feelers  towards the village. Its Being flooded into Helouan, and over it. Past  walls and houses, churches and hotels, the sea of Desert pressed in  silently with its myriad soft feet of sand. It poured in everywhere,  through crack and slit and crannie. These were reminders of possession  and ownership. And every passing wind that lifted eddies of dust at the  street corners were messages from the quiet, powerful Thing that  permitted Helouan to lie and dream so peacefully in the sunshine. Mere  artificial oasis, its existence was temporary, held on lease, just for  ninety-nine centuries or so.    This sea idea became insistent. For, in certain lights, and especially  in the brief, bewildering dusk, the Desert rose--swaying towards the  small white houses. The waves of it ran for fifty miles without a break.  It was too deep for foam or surface agitation, yet it knew the swell of  tides. And underneath flowed resolute currents, linking distance to the  centre. These many deserts were really one. A storm, just retreated, had  tossed Helouan upon the shore and left it there to dry; but any morning  he would wake to find it had been carried off again into the depths.  Some fragment, at least, would disappear. The grim Mokattam Hills were  rollers that ever threatened to topple down and submerge the sandy bar  that men called Helouan.    Being soundless, and devoid of perfume, the Desert's message reached him  through two senses only--sight and touch; chiefly, of course, the  former. Its invasion was concentrated through the eyes. And vision, thus  uncorrected, went what pace it pleased. The Desert played with him. Sand  stole into his being--through the eyes.    And so obsessing was this majesty of its close presence, that Henriot  sometimes wondered how people dared their little social activities  within its very sight and hearing; how they played golf and tennis upon  reclaimed edges of its face, picnicked so blithely hard upon its  frontiers, and danced at night while this stern, unfathomable Thing lay  breathing just beyond the trumpery walls that kept it out. The challenge  of their shallow admiration seemed presumptuous, almost provocative.  Their pursuit of pleasure suggested insolent indifference. They ran  fool-hardy hazards, he felt; for there was no worship in their vulgar  hearts. With a mental shudder, sometimes he watched the cheap tourist  horde go laughing, chattering past within view of its ancient,  half-closed eyes. It was like defying deity.    For, to his stirred imagination the sublimity of the Desert dwarfed  humanity. These people had been wiser to choose another place for the  flaunting of their tawdry insignificance. Any minute this Wilderness,  \"huddled in grey annihilation,\" might awake and notice them ...!    In his own hotel were several \"smart,\" so-called \"Society\" people who  emphasised the protest in him to the point of definite contempt.  Overdressed, the latest worldly novel under their arms, they strutted  the narrow pavements of their tiny world, immensely pleased with  themselves. Their vacuous minds expressed themselves in the slang of  their exclusive circle--value being the element excluded. The pettiness  of their outlook hardly distressed him--he was too familiar with it at  home--but their essential vulgarity, their innate ugliness, seemed more  than usually offensive in the grandeur of its present setting. Into the  mighty sands they took the latest London scandal, gabbling it over even  among the Tombs and Temples. And \"it was to laugh,\" the pains they spent  wondering whom they might condescend to know, never dreaming that they  themselves were not worth knowing. Against the background of the noble  Desert their titles seemed the cap and bells of clowns.    And Henriot, knowing some of them personally, could not always escape  their insipid company. Yet he was the gainer. They little guessed how  their commonness heightened contrast, set mercilessly thus beside the  strange, eternal beauty of the sand.    Occasionally the protest in his soul betrayed itself in words, which  of course they did not understand. \"He is so clever, isn't he?\"  And then, having relieved his feelings, he would comfort himself  characteristically:    \"The Desert has not noticed them. The Sand is not aware of their  existence. How should the sea take note of rubbish that lies above its  tide-line?\"    For Henriot drew near to its great shifting altars in an attitude of  worship. The wilderness made him kneel in heart. Its shining reaches led  to the oldest Temple in the world, and every journey that he made was  like a sacrament. For him the Desert was a consecrated place. It was  sacred.    And his tactful hosts, knowing his peculiarities, left their house open  to him when he cared to come--they lived upon the northern edge of the  oasis--and he was as free as though he were absolutely alone. He blessed  them; he rejoiced that he had come. Little Helouan accepted him. The  Desert knew that he was there.           *       *       *       *       *    From his corner of the big dining-room he could see the other guests,  but his roving eye always returned to the figure of a solitary man who  sat at an adjoining table, and whose personality stirred his interest.  While affecting to look elsewhere, he studied him as closely as might  be. There was something about the stranger that touched his  curiosity--a certain air of expectation that he wore. But it was more  than that: it was anticipation, apprehension in it somewhere. The man  was nervous, uneasy. His restless way of suddenly looking about him  proved it. Henriot tried every one else in the room as well; but, though  his thought settled on others too, he always came back to the figure of  this solitary being opposite, who ate his dinner as if afraid of being  seen, and glanced up sometimes as if fearful of being watched. Henriot's  curiosity, before he knew it, became suspicion. There was mystery here.  The table, he noticed, was laid for two.    \"Is he an actor, a priest of some strange religion, an enquiry agent, or  just--a crank?\" was the thought that first occurred to him. And the  question suggested itself without amusement. The impression of  subterfuge and caution he conveyed left his observer unsatisfied.    The face was clean shaven, dark, and strong; thick hair, straight yet  bushy, was slightly unkempt; it was streaked with grey; and an  unexpected mobility when he smiled ran over the features that he seemed  to hold rigid by deliberate effort. The man was cut to no quite common  measure. Henriot jumped to an intuitive conclusion: \"He's not here for  pleasure or merely sight-seeing. Something serious has brought him out  to Egypt.\" For the face combined too ill-assorted qualities: an  obstinate tenacity that might even mean brutality, and was certainly  repulsive, yet, with it, an undecipherable dreaminess betrayed by lines  of the mouth, but above all in the very light blue eyes, so rarely  raised. Those eyes, he felt, had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16728"],[0,"A Catechism of Familiar Things; (#16)"],[1,"was also an illustrious English navigator and  historian, born in 1552. He performed great services for Queen  Elizabeth, particularly in the discovery of Virginia, and in the  defeat of the Spanish Armada; he lived in honor and prosperity during  her reign, but on the accession of James the First, was stripped of  his favor at court, unaccountably accused of high treason, tried, and  condemned to die; being reprieved, however, he was imprisoned in the  Tower of London many years, during which time he devoted himself to  writing and study. Receiving, at last, a commission to go and explore  the gold mines at Guiana, he embarked; but his design having been  betrayed to the Spaniards, he was defeated: and on his return to  England, in July, 1618, was arrested and beheaded, (by order of the  King, on his former attainder,) October 29; suffering his fate with  great magnanimity.         _High Treason_, in England, means an offence committed       against the sovereign. In the United States it consists in       levying war against the government, adhering to its enemies,       and giving them aid and comfort.         _Reprieved_, respited from sentence of death.         _Magnanimity_, greatness of mind, bravery.      What is Gum?    A mucilaginous juice, exuding from the bark of certain trees or  plants, drawn thence by the warmth of the sun in the form of a  glutinous matter; and afterwards by the same cause rendered firm and  tenacious. There are many different gums, named after the particular  tree or plant from which they are produced.         _Mucilaginous_, consisting of mucilage.         _Tenacious_, adhering closely.      What is the character of Gum?    Gum is capable of being dissolved in water, and forming with it a  viscid transparent fluid; but not in vinous spirits or oil; it burns  in the fire to a black coal, without melting or catching fire; and  does not dissolve in water at boiling heat. The name of _gum_ has been  inaccurately given to several species of gum-resins, which consist of  resin and various other substances, flowing from many kinds of trees,  and becoming hard by exposure to the air. These are soluble in dilute  alcohol. Gum is originally a milky liquor, having a greater quantity  of water mixed with its oily parts, and for that reason it dissolves  in either water or oil. Another sort is not oily, and therefore  dissolves in water only, as gum Arabic, the gum of the cherry-tree,  &c.         _Viscid_, thick, ropy.         _Vinous_, having the qualities of wine.      Are the last-mentioned sorts properly called Gums?    No, though commonly called gums, they are only dried mucilages, which  were nothing else than the mucilaginous lymph issuing from the vessels  of the tree, in the same manner as it does from mallows, comfrey, and  even from the cucumber; the vessels of which being cut across, yield a  lymph which is plainly mucilaginous, and if well dried, at length  becomes a kind of gum, or rather, a hardened mucilage.         _Lymph_, transparent fluid.      What is Gum Arabic?    The juice of a small tree of the Acacia tribe, growing in Egypt,  Arabia Petraea, Palestine, and in different parts of America.      Are there other plants or trees which produce Gum, besides those  already mentioned?    A great number, though not all commonly in use. The leaves of rhubarb,  the common plum, and even the sloe and the laurel, produce a clear,  tasteless gum; there are also a number of different gums, brought from  foreign countries, of great use in medicine and the arts. Most of the  Acacias produce gums, though the quality of all is not equally good.      What is Rhubarb?    A valuable root growing in China, Turkey, and Russian Tartary.  Quantities of it are imported from other parts of the world: that from  Turkey is esteemed the best. Rhubarb is also cultivated in our  gardens, and the stalks of the leaves are often used in tarts; but the  root, from the difference of climate, does not possess any medicinal  virtue.          CHAPTER XII.    SPECTACLES, MARINER'S COMPASS, BAROMETER, THERMOMETER, WATCHES,  CLOCKS, TELESCOPE, MICROSCOPE, GUNPOWDER, STEAM ENGINE, AND  ELECTRO-MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH.      When were Spectacles invented, and who was their inventor?    It is supposed that they were first known about the thirteenth  century, and invented by a monk of Pisa, in Italy, named Alexander de  Spina. Spectacles are composed of two circular pieces of glass set in  a frame.      What are these glasses called?    Lenses. They are either convex or concave, according to the kind of  sight requiring them. Old people, and those who can only see things at  a distance, from the flatness of the eye, which prevents the rays of  light converging so as to meet in the centre, require convex lenses.  People who can only distinguish objects when viewed closely, from the  eye being too convex, require concave lenses to counteract it by  spreading the rays, and thus rendering vision distinct.         _Convex_, rising outwardly in a circular form; opposite to       concave.         _Concave_, hollow; round, but hollow, as the inner curve of       an arch, &c.         _Converging_, tending to one point from different parts.         _Vision_, the faculty of seeing.      What is the Mariner's Compass?    A most useful and important instrument, by the aid of which the  navigator guides his ship on the sea, and steers his way to the place  of his destination. The inventor of the Mariner's Compass is not  known, nor the exact time of its introduction; it was employed in  Europe in navigation about the middle of the thirteenth century, and  has been in use more than five hundred years. The Chinese are said to  have been acquainted with it much earlier, but no reliance can be  placed on their dates. The power of the loadstone to attract iron was  known to the ancient Egyptians, but it was not applied to any  practical purpose.         _Navigator_, one who guides a ship.         _Steer_, to direct or guide a vessel in its course.         _Destination_, the place to which a person is bound.         _Practical_, capable of practice, not merely speculative.      What is the Loadstone?    An ore of iron which possesses the peculiar property of attracting  iron, namely, of drawing it in contact with its own mass, and holding  it firmly attached by its own power of attraction. A piece of  loadstone drawn several times along a needle, or a small piece of  iron, converts it into an artificial magnet; if this magnetized needle  is carefully balanced, it will turn round of itself, till its end  points towards the North. The magnetized needle also possesses the  power of attracting iron, and of communicating this power to another  piece of iron or steel, similar to that of the loadstone itself.         _Contact_, touch.         _Magnetized_, rendered magnetic.      Describe the Mariner's Compass.    The Mariner's Compass consists of a circular box, enclosing a  magnetized bar of steel, called the _needle_, carefully balanced on an  upright steel pivot, and having that end which points to the North  shaped like the head of an arrow; attached to this needle, and turning  with it, is a card on which are printed the divisions of North, South.  East, and West; called the points of the compass. By simply looking at  the position of the needle, the mariner can see the direction in which  his vessel is sailing, and regulate his helm accordingly.         _Helm_, the instrument by which a ship is steered,       consisting of a rudder and tiller.      What is a Barometer?    An instrument for measuring the weight of the atmosphere, which  enables us to determine the changes of the weather, the height of  mountains, &c. It consists of a glass tube hermetically sealed at one  end, filled with mercury, and inverted in a basin of mercury;  according to the weight of the atmosphere, this mercury rises or  falls.      How is the Hermetic seal formed?    By heating the edges of a vessel, till they are just ready to melt,  and then twisting them closely together with hot pincers, so that the  air may be totally excluded. The word is taken from Hermes, the Greek  name for Mercury, the heathen god of arts and learning, and the  supposed inventor of chemistry,[9] which is sometimes called the  hermetical art; or perhaps from Hermes, an ancient king of Egypt, who  was either its inventor, or excelled in it.    [Footnote 9: See Chapter XVIII., article Chemistry.]      What is Mercury?    Quicksilver, or mercury, is a white fluid metal, the heaviest except  platina and gold; it readily combines with nearly all other metals,  and is used in the manufacture of looking-glasses, barometers,  thermometers, &c.; in some of the arts, and in the preparation of  several powerful medicines. It is found in California, Hungary,  Sweden, Spain, China, and Peru. The quicksilver mine of Guanca Velica,  in Peru, is one hundred and seventy fathoms in circumference, and four  hundred and eighty deep. In this profound abyss are seen streets,  squares, and a chapel, where religious worship is performed. The  quicksilver mines of Idria, a town of Lower Austria, have continually  been wrought for more than 300 years. The vapor which is continually  arising from the mercury is very hurtful to the miners, who seldom  survive many years.         _Abyss_, a gulf, a depth without bottom.      In what state is Mercury usually found?    Either native, or in the form of ore; it is often found mixed with  silver, but more frequently with sulphur in the form of sulphuret,  which is decomposed by distillation. Running mercury is found in  globules, in America, and is collected from the clefts of the rocks.  Mercury has the appearance of melted silver; it is neither ductile nor  malleable in this state; it is a substance so volatile, when heated,  that it may be evaporated like water; it is always seen in a fluid  state, even in temperate climates, as a very small portion of heat"]]]
