Montgomery, with a small army,  was sent to capture Montreal and then to march down the St. Lawrence to  Quebec. Benedict Arnold led another force through the Maine woods. After  tremendous exertions and terrible sufferings he reached Quebec. But the  garrison had been warned of his coming. He blockaded the town and waited  for Montgomery. The garrison was constantly increased, for Arnold was  not strong enough fully to blockade the town. At last Montgomery  arrived. At night, amidst a terrible snowstorm, Montgomery and Arnold  led their brave followers to the attack. They were beaten back with  cruel loss. Montgomery was killed, and Arnold was severely wounded. In  the spring of 1776 the survivors of this little band of heroes were  rescued--at the cost of the lives of five thousand American soldiers.

British Attack on Charleston, 1776.--In June 1776 a British  fleet and army made an attack on Charleston, South Carolina. This town  has never been taken by attack from the sea. Sand bars guard the  entrance of the harbor and the channels through these shoals lead  directly to the end of Sullivan's Island. At that point the Americans  built a fort of palmetto logs and sand. General Moultrie commanded at  the fort and it was named in his honor, Fort Moultrie. The British fleet  sailed boldly in, but the balls from the ships' guns were stopped by the  soft palmetto logs. At one time the flag was shot away and fell down  outside the fort. But Sergeant Jasper rushed out, seized the broken  staff, and again set it up on the rampart. Meantime, General Clinton had  landed on an island and was trying to cross with his soldiers to the  further end of Sullivan's Island. But the water was at first too shoal  for the boats. The soldiers jumped overboard to wade. Suddenly the water  deepened, and they had to jump aboard to save themselves from drowning.  All this time Americans were firing at them from the beach. General  Clinton ordered a retreat. The fleet also sailed out--all that could  get away--and the whole expedition was abandoned.    [Illustration: GENERAL MOULTRIE.]    [Sidenote: Defense of New York, 1776.]    [Sidenote: Battle of Long Island, 1776.]    [Sidenote: Escape of the Americans.]    141. Long Island and Brooklyn Heights, 1776.--The very day that the  British left Boston, Washington ordered five regiments to New York. For  he well knew that city would be the next point of attack. But he need  not have been in such a hurry. General Howe, the new British  commander-in-chief, sailed first to Halifax and did not begin the  campaign in New York until the end of August. He then landed his  soldiers on Long Island and prepared to drive the Americans away.  Marching in a round-about way, he cut the American army in two and  captured one part of it. This brought him to the foot of Brooklyn  Heights. On the top was a fort. Probably Howe could easily have captured  it. But he had led in the field at Bunker Hill and had had enough of  attacking forts defended by Americans. So he stopped his soldiers--with  some difficulty. That night the wind blew a gale, and the next day was  foggy. The British fleet could not sail into the East River. Skillful  fishermen safely ferried the rest of the American army across to New  York. When at length the British marched to the attack, there was no one  left in the fort on Brooklyn Heights.    [Sidenote: Retreat from New York.]    [Sidenote: Washington crosses the Delaware.]    142. From the Hudson to the Delaware, 1776.--Even now with his  splendid fleet and great army Howe could have captured the Americans.  But he delayed so long that Washington got away in safety. Washington's  army was now fast breaking up. Soldiers deserted by the hundreds. A  severe action at White Plains only delayed the British advance. The fall  of Fort Washington on the end of Manhattan Island destroyed all hope of  holding anything near New York. Washington sent one part of his army to  secure the Highlands of the Hudson. With the other part he retired  across New Jersey to the southern side of the Delaware River. The end of  the war seemed to be in sight. In December, 1776, Congress gave the sole  direction of the war to Washington and then left Philadelphia for a  place of greater safety.    [Sidenote: Battle of Trenton, 1776. _Higginson_, 203; _Hero Tales_,  45-55]    143. Trenton, December 26, 1776.--Washington did not give up. On  Christmas night, 1776, he crossed the Delaware with a division of his  army. A violent snowstorm was raging, the river was full of ice. But  Washington was there in person, and the soldiers crossed. Then the storm  changed to sleet and rain. But on the soldiers marched. When the Hessian  garrison at Trenton looked about them next morning they saw that  Washington and Greene held the roads leading inland from the town.  Stark and a few soldiers--among them James Monroe--held the bridge  leading over the Assanpink to the next British post. A few horsemen  escaped before Stark could prevent them. But all the foot soldiers were  killed or captured. A few days later nearly one thousand prisoners  marched through Philadelphia. They were Germans, who had been sold by  their rulers to Britain's king to fight his battles. They were called  Hessians by the Americans because most of them came from the little  German state of Hesse Cassel.    [Illustration: Battle of Trenton.]    [Illustration: Battle of Princeton.]    [Sidenote: Battle of Princeton, 1777. _Source-Book_, 149-151.]    144. Princeton, January, 1777.--Trenton saved the Revolution by  giving the Americans renewed courage. General Howe sent Lord Cornwallis  with a strong force to destroy the Americans. Washington with the main  part of his army was now encamped on the southern side of the  Assanpink. Cornwallis was on the other bank at Trenton. Leaving a few  men to keep up the campfires, and to throw up a slight fort by the  bridge over the stream, Washington led his army away by night toward  Princeton. There he found several regiments hastening to Cornwallis. He  drove them away and led his army to the highlands of New Jersey where he  would be free from attack. The British abandoned nearly all their posts  in New Jersey and retired to New York.          CHAPTER 15      THE GREAT DECLARATION AND THE FRENCH ALLIANCE    [Sidenote: Rising spirit of independence, 1775-76.]    145. Growth of the Spirit of Independence.--The year 1776 is even  more to be remembered for the doings of Congress than it is for the  doings of the soldiers. The colonists loved England. They spoke of it as  home. They were proud of the strength of the British empire, and glad to  belong to it. But their feelings rapidly changed when the British  government declared them to be rebels, made war upon them, and hired  foreign soldiers to kill them. They could no longer be subjects of  George III. That was clear enough. They determined to declare themselves  to be independent. Virginia led in this movement, and the chairman of  the Virginia delegation moved a resolution of independence. A committee  was appointed to draw up a declaration.    [Illustration: FIRST UNITED STATES FLAG. Adopted by Congress in 1777.]    [Sidenote: The Great Declaration, adopted July 4, 1776. _Higginson_,  194-201; _McMaster_, 131-135; _Source-Book_, 147-149.]    [Sidenote: Signing of the Declaration, August 2, 1776.]    146. The Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776.--The most  important members of this committee were Benjamin Franklin, John Adams,  and Thomas Jefferson. Of these Jefferson was the youngest, and the least  known. But he had already drawn up a remarkable paper called _A Summary  View of the Rights of British America._ The others asked him to write  out a declaration. He sat down without book or notes of any kind, and  wrote out the Great Declaration in almost the same form in which it now  stands. The other members of the committee proposed a few changes, and  then reported the declaration to Congress. There was a fierce debate in  Congress over the adoption of the Virginia resolution for independence.  But finally it was adopted. Congress then examined the Declaration of  Independence as reported by the committee. It made a few changes in the  words and struck out a clause condemning the slave-trade. The first  paragraph of the Declaration contains a short, clear statement of the  basis of the American system of government. It should be learned by  heart by every American boy and girl, and always kept in mind. The  Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776. A few copies were printed on  July 5, with the signatures of John Hancock and Charles Thompson,  president and secretary of Congress. On August 2, 1776, the Declaration  was signed by the members of Congress.

The Loss of Philadelphia, 1777.--For some months after the  battle of Princeton there was little fighting. But in the summer of  1777, Howe set out to capture Philadelphia. Instead of marching across  New Jersey, he placed his army on board ships, and sailed to Chesapeake  Bay. As soon as Washington learned what Howe was about, he marched to  Chad's Ford, where the road from Chesapeake Bay to Philadelphia crossed  Brandywine Creek. Howe moved his men as if about to attempt to cross the  ford. Meantime he sent Cornwallis with a strong force to cross the creek  higher up. Cornwallis surprised the right wing of the American army,  drove it back, and Washington was compelled to retreat. Howe occupied  Philadelphia and captured the forts below the city. Washington tried to  surprise a part of the British army which was posted at Germantown.

Port, sherry, and madeira, are decanted. Hocks and champagnes appear  in their native bottles. Claret and burgundy are handed round in a  claret-jug.    Coffee and liqueurs should be handed round when the dessert has  been about a quarter of an hour on the table. After this, the ladies  generally retire.    Should no servant be present to do so, the gentleman who is nearest  the door should hold it for the ladies to pass through.    When the ladies leave the dining-room, the gentlemen all rise in their  places, and do not resume their seats till the last lady is gone.    The servants leave the room when the dessert is on the table.    If you should unfortunately overturn or break anything, do not  apologize for it. You can show your regret in your face, but it is not  well-bred to put it into words.    Should you injure a lady's dress, apologise amply, and assist her, if  possible, to remove all traces of the damage.    To abstain from taking the last piece on the dish, or the last glass  of wine in the decanter, only because it is the last, is highly  ill-bred. It implies a fear that the vacancy cannot be supplied, and  almost conveys an affront to your host.    In summing up the little duties and laws of the table, a popular  author has said that--\"The chief matter of consideration at  the dinner-table--as, indeed, everywhere else in the life of a  gentleman--is to be perfectly composed and at his ease. He speaks  deliberately; he performs the most important act of the day as if  he were performing the most ordinary. Yet there is no appearance of  trifling or want of gravity in his manner; he maintains the dignity  which is so becoming on so vital an occasion. He performs all the  ceremonies, yet in the style of one who performs no ceremonies at all.  He goes through all the complicated duties of the scene as if he were  'to the manner born.'\"    To the giver of a dinner we have but one or two remarks to offer. If  he be a bachelor, he had better give his dinner at a good hotel, or  have it sent in from Birch's or Kuehn's. If a married man, he will, we  presume, enter into council with his wife and his cook. In any  case, however, he should always bear in mind that it is his duty to  entertain his friends in the best manner that his means permit;  and that this is the least he can do to recompense them for the  expenditure of time and money which they incur in accepting his  invitation.    \"To invite a friend to dinner,\" says Brillat Savarin, \"is to become  responsible for his happiness so long as he is under your roof.\"  Again:--\"He who receives friends at his table, without having bestowed his  personal supervision upon the repast placed before them, is unworthy  to have friends.\"    A dinner, to be excellent, need not consist of a great variety of  dishes; but everything should be of the best, and the cookery should  be perfect. That which should be cool should be cool as ice; that  which should be hot should be smoking; the attendance should be  rapid and noiseless; the guests well assorted; the wines of the best  quality; the host attentive and courteous; the room well lighted; and  the time punctual.    Every dinner should begin with soup, be followed by fish, and include  some kind of game. \"The soup is to the dinner,\" we are told by Grisnod  de la Regniere, \"what the portico is to a building, or the overture to  an opera.\"    To this aphorism we may be permitted to add that a _chasse_ of cognac  or curacoa at the close of the dinner is like the epilogue at the end  of a comedy.    One more quotation and we have done:--\"To perform faultlessly the  honours of the table is one of the most difficult things in society.  It might indeed he asserted without much fear of contradiction, that  no man has as yet ever reached exact propriety in his office as host,  or has hit the mean between exerting himself too much and too little.  His great business is to put every one entirely at his ease, to  gratify all his desires, and make him, in a word, absolutely contented  with men and things. To accomplish this, he must have the genius  of tact to perceive, and the genius of finesse to execute; ease  and frankness of manner; a knowledge of the world that nothing  can surprise; a calmness of temper that nothing can disturb; and a  kindness of disposition that can never be exhausted. When he receives  others he must be content to forget himself; he must relinquish  all desire to shine, and even all attempts to please his guests by  conversation, and rather do all in his power to let them please one  another. He behaves to them without agitation, without affectation; he  pays attention without an air of protection; he encourages the timid,  draws out the silent, and directs conversation without sustaining  it himself. He who does not do all this is wanting in his duty as  host--_he who does, is more than mortal_.\"    In conclusion, we may observe that to sit long in the dining-room  after the ladies have retired is to pay a bad compliment to the  hostess and her fair visitors; and that it is a still worse tribute  to rejoin them with a flushed face and impaired powers of thought. A  refined gentleman is always temperate.           *       *       *       *       *    XI.--THE BALL-ROOM.      Invitations to a ball are issued at least ten days in advance; and  this term is sometimes, in the height of the season, extended to three  weeks, or even a month.    An invitation should be accepted or declined within a day or two of  its reception.    Gentlemen who do not dance should not accept invitations of this kind.  They are but incumbrances in the ball-room, besides which, it looks  like a breach of etiquette and courtesy to stand or sit idly by when  there are, most probably, ladies in the room who are waiting for an  invitation to dance.    A ball generally begins about half-past nine or ten o'clock.    A man who stands up to dance without being acquainted with the  figures, makes himself ridiculous, and places his partner in an  embarrassing and unenviable position. There is no need for him to know  the steps. It is enough if he knows how to walk gracefully through the  dance, and to conduct his partner through it like a gentleman. No man  can waltz too well; but to perform steps in a quadrille is not only  unnecessary but _outre_.    A gentleman cannot ask a lady to dance without being first introduced  to her by some member of the hostess's family.    Never enter a ball-room in other than full evening dress, and white or  light kid gloves.    A gentleman cannot be too careful not to injure a lady's dress. The  young men of the present day are inconceivably thoughtless in this  respect, and often seem to think the mischief which they do scarcely  worth an apology. Cavalry officers should never wear spurs in a  ball-room.    Bear in mind that all _Casino_ habits are to be scrupulously avoided  in a private ball-room. It is an affront to a highly-bred lady to hold  her hand behind you, or on your hip, when dancing a round dance. We  have seen even aristocratic young men of the \"fast\" genus commit these  unpardonable offences against taste and decorum.    Never forget a ball-room engagement. It is the greatest neglect and  slight that a gentleman can offer to a lady.    At the beginning and end of a quadrille the gentleman bows to his  partner, and bows again on handing her to a seat.    After dancing, the gentleman may offer to conduct the lady to the  refreshment-room.    Should a lady decline your hand for a dance, and afterwards stand  up with another partner, you will do well to attribute her error to  either forgetfulness or ignorance of the laws of etiquette. Politeness  towards your host and hostess demands that you should never make any  little personal grievance the ground of discomfort or disagreement.    A gentleman conducts his last partner to supper; waits upon her till  she has had as much refreshment as she desires, and then re-conducts  her to the ball-room.    However much pleasure you may take in the society of any particular  lady, etiquette forbids that you should dance with her too frequently.  Engaged persons would do well to bear this maxim in mind.    It is customary to call upon your entertainers within a few days after  the ball.[A]    [Footnote A: For a more detailed account of the laws and business of  the ball, see the chapters entitled \"The Ball-room Guide.\"]           *       *       *       *       *    XII.--STAYING AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE:--BREAKFAST, LUNCHEON, &c.      A visitor is bound by the laws of social intercourse to conform in all  respects to the habits of the house. In order to do this effectually,  he should inquire, or cause his personal servant to inquire, what  those habits are. To keep your friend's breakfast on the table till a  late hour; to delay the dinner by want of punctuality; to accept other  invitations, and treat his house as if it were merely an hotel to  be slept in; or to keep the family up till unwonted hours, are alike  evidences of a want of good feeling and good breeding.    At breakfast and lunch absolute punctuality is not imperative; but a  visitor should avoid being always the last to appear at table.    No order of precedence is observed at either breakfast or luncheon.  Persons take their seats as they come in, and, having exchanged their  morning salutations, begin to eat without waiting for the rest of the  party.    If letters are delivered to you at breakfast or luncheon, you may read  them by asking permission from the lady who presides at the urn.    Always hold yourself at the disposal of those in whose house you are  visiting. If they propose to ride, drive, walk, or otherwise occupy  the day, you may take it for granted that these plans are made with  reference to your enjoyment. You should, therefore, receive them with  cheerfulness, enter into them with"]]]
