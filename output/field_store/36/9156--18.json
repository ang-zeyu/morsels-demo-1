TOMATO SAUCE WITH CHEESE      1 cup tomato sauce    1/2 cup grated cheese    Add cheese while sauce is hot and just before serving. Do not boil  sauce after adding cheese.      MEXICAN SAUCE    To one cup tomato sauce, add      2 tablespoons chopped green pepper    3 tablespoons chopped celery    3 tablespoons chopped carrot      HARD SAUCE      1/3 cup butter substitute or hydrogenated oil    1/3 cup corn syrup    1/3 cup sugar    1 teaspoon flavoring    Cream all together. This method reduces the necessary sugar  two-thirds.      LEMON OR ORANGE SAUCE      1/2 cup corn syrup    1 tablespoon fat    1/4 cup lemon juice    1 teaspoon lemon rind    2 tablespoons cornstarch    3 tablespoons lemon juice    1/2 cup orange juice    2 teaspoons orange rind    1 tablespoon flour    1 tablespoon water    Mix ingredients. Bring to boiling point and serve.      CRANBERRY SAUCE WITH RAISINS      1 cup cranberries    1 cup water    1 cup corn syrup    1/2 cup raisins or nuts    2 tablespoons fat    Cook cranberries in water until they are soft and the water is almost  entirely absorbed. Add other ingredients and cook about 20 minutes  slowly until thick enough to use as sauce.          THE USE OF GELATINE IN COMBINING LEFTOVERS      LEFTOVER FRUIT MOLD      2 tablespoons cold water    2 tablespoons gelatine    Let stand until gelatine is soft. Add 1 pint boiling water, or fruit  juice from canned fruit.      1/4 cup lemon juice    2/3 cup corn syrup, or    1/2 cup sugar    Stir until gelatine is dissolved. Add 1 cup leftover fruit. Place  in mold which has been dipped in cold water. Stir occasionally while  hardening so fruit does not settle to the bottom. Or a little gelatine  may be poured in mold and allowed to grow almost hard; then some  fruit arranged on it and more gelatine poured in. Repeat until mold is  filled; then chill, and turn out carefully.      MOLDED VEGETABLE SALAD      1-1/2 cups boiling tomato juice and pulp    2 tablespoons cold water    2 tablespoons gelatine    1 teaspoon salt    1/4 teaspoon paprika    1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce    2 cups of any one vegetable, or of mixed vegetables    Soften gelatine in the cold water. Add other ingredients and chill.  Stir once or twice while chilling so vegetables do not settle to the  bottom.      MOLDED MEAT OR FISH LOAF      2 tablespoons gelatine    2 tablespoons cold water    1 cup boiling gravy, tomato juice, or 1 cup boiling water into            which 1 bouillon cube has been dissolved    1 cup left-over meat or fish chopped fine    1 cup chopped celery or cooked vegetable    1 teaspoon salt    1/8 teaspoon cayenne    Soften gelatine in cold water. Add other ingredients. Stir until  gelatine is dissolved. Pour into mold dipped into cold water. Chill.  Stir once or twice while hardening so meat does not settle to the  bottom. Serve with salad dressing.      RICE IMPERIAL      1 cup cooked rice    1 cup corn syrup    1 tablespoon gelatine    2 tablespoons water    1/2 cup cherries or other cooked fruit    1/2 cup nuts    1/2 cup juice of fruit    Chill and serve.      CREAM SALAD MOLD      1 cup cooked salad dressing    2 tablespoons gelatine    2 cups any left-over fish, meat or vegetables    2 tablespoons cold water    Use any well-seasoned salad dressing. Soften the gelatine in the cold  water. Dissolve over boiling water. Add to salad dressing. Add other  ingredients well seasoned and chill.      CHEESE MOLD      1 pint cottage cheese    1/2 cup pimento or green pepper    1 cup milk    2 teaspoons salt    1/4 teaspoon cayenne    2 tablespoons granulated gelatine    4 tablespoons cold water    Soften gelatine in the cold water. Dissolve over hot water. Add all  ingredients. Mix thoroughly and place in mold which has been rinsed  with cold water. When firm, serve as salad.      FRUIT SPONGE      2 tablespoons gelatine softened in    1/3 cup cold water    1 pint clabbered milk, or fruit juice    1 cup sugar    1 teaspoon vanilla    1 cup crushed fruit    2 egg whites    Mix gelatine with milk. Add sugar. When it begins to thicken, beat  with rotary beater. Add vanilla and fruit. Fold in egg whites and  turn into mold. Apple sauce, strawberries, rhubarb, pineapple or  raspberries may be used.      ORIENTAL SALAD      1 tablespoon gelatine    2 cups boiling water    3/4 cup sugar    1/2 cup lemon juice    1/2 cup grated cocoanut    2 cups apples, chopped    1 cup celery    1/2 cup chopped nuts    3 pimentoes    1 tablespoon grated onion    1/3 teaspoon salt    Soften gelatine in 2 tablespoons cold water, then dissolve in the  boiling water, but do not cook after gelatine is put in. Add all other  ingredients. Mold and chill. Serve with cooked or mayonnaise salad  dressing, plain or on lettuce leaves.          SALADS PROVIDE AN EASY METHOD OF USING LEFTOVERS      MIXED VEGETABLE SALAD      1 cup cooked potatoes    1 cup cooked carrots    1 cup cooked peas    1 cup cooked beets    Make a French dressing of      1/2 cup oil    1/2 teaspoon salt    2 tablespoons vinegar    1/8 teaspoon cayenne    Mix dressing thoroughly and pour over the vegetables. If vegetables  are kept in different bowls instead of mixed together, the flavor  of the salad is improved. Any vegetable may be used in this way. Let  stand 30 minutes. When ready to serve, place each portion in a nest  made of two lettuce leaves or other salad, green. If desired, cooked  dressing may be mixed with the vegetable in place of French dressing,  or may be served with it.      EGYPTIAN SALAD      1 cup left-over baked beans, cooked dried peas, or beans or            lentils, or cooked rice, rice.    1 cup chopped celery    3 tablespoons chopped pepper    3 tablespoons chopped pickle    1 cup cooked salad dressing    Mix ingredients thoroughly and let stand 30 minutes to blend flavor  thoroughly.      CABBAGE, PEANUT AND APPLE SALAD      2 cups chopped cabbage    1 cup peanuts    1 cup chopped apples    1 cup salad dressing    Mix ingredients and serve with French dressing. This salad looks very  appetizing when served in cups made of hollowed out red apples, the  pulp removed being used in the salad.      CHEESE SALAD      1 cup American or cream cheese    2 tablespoons vinegar    1/3 cup oil    1/2 teaspoon salt    1/8 teaspoon cayenne    2 tablespoons chopped olives    3 tablespoons chopped nuts    Blend all ingredients thoroughly. Shape as desired and chill. Serve  with French dressing. (If American cheese is used, grate or cut fine.)      FRUIT SALAD      Left-over small portions of fruits may be blended in almost any  combination to form a salad. Plain French dressing or French dressing  made with fruit juice in place of vinegar, or cooked dressing or  mayonnaise may be combined with the fruit. Bananas combine well with  any other fruit and, being the least expensive fruit, may be used as  the basis of fruit salads.      MANDALAY SALAD      1 cup cooked peas or carrots    1 cup cooked cold rice    Mix with dressing made of      1/3 cup oil    1 tablespoon vinegar    1/4 teaspoon salt    1/8 teaspoon cayenne    1/4 teaspoon curry powder    Mix all ingredients; serve cold, either plain, on lettuce leaves, or  in nests made of cabbage or celery.      POTATO SALAD      2 cups potatoes from fresh-cooked, or left-over baked, boiled or            mashed potatoes.    1/4 cup chopped parsley    1 teaspoon onion juice    1 cup cooked salad dressing    3 tablespoons chopped green pepper may be added if desired.    If mixed while cooked dressing is hot, then chilled, the flavor is  much improved.    Left-over mashed potatoes may be combined with cooked corn and green  pepper for a delicious salad.      MEAT OR FISH SALAD      1 cup left-over meat or fish    3 tablespoons chopped pickle    1/2 cup chopped celery    1 cup cooked salad dressing    Mix ingredients thoroughly and serve. If one-quarter cup of French  dressing is mixed with meat or fish, 30 minutes before adding other  ingredients, the flavor is much improved.      CAULIFLOWER SALAD      1 cup cooked cauliflower    1 cup cooked salad dressing    3 tablespoons chopped pickle    1 tablespoon chopped pimento    1 tablespoon vinegar    Blend ingredients thoroughly and serve. Cauliflower which has been  creamed or scalloped may be used, if sauce is carefully rinsed from  the vegetable.      CARROT SALAD    Grind raw carrot in food chopper. Make French dressing with chicken  fat instead of oil. Mix ingredients and serve.      1 cup raw carrots    1/2 cup oil (preferably oil from chicken fat)    1 tablespoon vinegar    1/2 teaspoon salt    1 tablespoon parsley    1/8 teaspoon paprika      HINDU SALAD      2 tablespoons flour    1 teaspoon salt    1 egg    1/8 teaspoon cayenne    2 tablespoons granulated gelatine, plus 2 tablespoons cold water    1 teaspoon mustard    1 teaspoon curry powder    3 tablespoons melted fat    1 cup milk    1/3 cup vinegar    2 cups cooked rice    2 tablespoons chopped olives    Mix dry ingredients, add egg and blend thoroughly. Add melted fat,  milk and vinegar. Cook over hot water until thick as custard. Soften  gelatine in cold water. Add to the hot dressing. When dissolved add  rice and olives, place in mold and chill. Serve plain or with 1/2 cup  French dressing.          THE USE OF STALE BREAD, CAKE, AND LEFTOVER CEREAL      DATE CRUMB PUDDING      1 cup dried crumbs    1 pint hot milk    Let stand until milk is absorbed, then add      1/4 teaspoon salt    1/2 cup molasses    1/2 teaspoon cinnamon    1 cup dates, cut small    1 egg    1/2 teaspoon mixed cloves, nutmeg, allspice, ginger    Mix ingredients. Bake 40 minutes in moderately hot oven. This pudding  is so well flavored that it does not really require a sauce, but if  one is desired the molasses sauce on page *86, or the hard or lemon  sauce on page *87 will be found to suit.      FIG PUDDING      1/4 lb suet    1/2 lb chopped figs    1 cup sour apple (cored, pared and chopped)    1 cup milk    1/2 cup molasses    1/2 cup corn syrup"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15478"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 2, No. 1, April, 1915 (#16)"],[1,"that is usually understood by diplomacy. It  would clear the world altogether of those private understandings and  provisional secret agreements, those intrigues, wire-pullings, and  quasi-financial operations that have been the very substance of  international relations hitherto. To these able and interested people,  for the most part highly seasoned by the present conditions, finished  and elaborated players at the old game, this is to propose a new, crude,  difficult, and unsympathetic game. They may all of them, or most of  them, hate war, but they will cling to the belief that their method of  operating may now, after a new settlement, be able to prevent or  palliate war.    All men get set in a way of living, and it is as little in human nature  to give up cheerfully in the middle of life a familiar method of dealing  with things in favor of a new and untried one as it is to change one's  language or emigrate to an entirely different land. I realize what this  proposal means to diplomatists when I try to suppose myself united to  assist in the abolition of written books and journalism in favor of the  gramophone and the cinematograph. Or united to adopt German as my means  of expression. It is only by an enormous pressure of opinion in the  world behind these monarchs, ministers, and representatives that they  will be induced even to consider the possibility of adapting themselves  to this novel style of international dealing through a permanent  congress. It is only the consideration of its enormous hopefulness for  the rest of the world that gives one the courage to advocate it.    In the question of the possible abolition of the present diplomatic  system, just as in the case of the possible abolition of war, while on  the side for abolition there must be a hugely preponderating interest  and a hugely preponderating majority, it is, nevertheless, a dispersed  interest and an unorganized, miscellaneous majority. The minority is, on  the other hand, compact, more intensively and more immediately  interested and able to resist such great changes with a maximum of  efficiency. There is a tremendous need, therefore, for a world congress  organization propaganda if this advantageously posted minority is to be  overcome.    And from such countries as the American States in particular, and from  the small liberal neutrals in Europe, whose diplomacy is least developed  and least influential, liberal-minded people through the world are most  disposed to expect, and do expect, a lead in this particular matter. The  liberal forces in Britain, France, and Russia are extraordinarily  embarrassed and enslaved by the vast belligerent necessities into which  their lives have been caught. But they would take up such a lead with  the utmost vigor and enthusiasm.    No one who has followed the diplomatic history of the negotiations that  led to this war can doubt that if there had been no secret treaties, but  instead open proclamations of intentions and an open discussion of  international ambitions, the world might have been saved this  catastrophe. It is no condemnation of any person or country to say this.  The reserves and hesitations and misconceptions that led Germany to  suppose that England would wait patiently while France and Belgium were  destroyed before she herself received attention were unavoidable under  the existing diplomatic conditions. What reasonable people have to do  now is not to recriminate over the details in the working of a system  that we can now all of us perceive to be hopelessly bad, but to do our  utmost in this season of opportunity to destroy the obscurities in which  fresh mischief may fester for our children.    Let me restate this section in slightly different words. At the end of  this war there must be a congress of adjustment. The suggestion in this  section is to make this congress permanent, to use it as a clearing  house of international relationships and to abolish embassies.    Instead of there being a British Ambassador, for example, at every  sufficiently important capital, and an ambassador from every important  State in London, and a complex tangle of relationships, misstatements,  and misconceptions arising from the ill-co-ordinated activities of this  double system of agents, it is proposed to send one or several  ambassadors to some central point, such as The Hague, to meet there all  the ambassadors of all the significant States in the world and to deal  with international questions with a novel frankness in a collective  meeting.    This has now become a possible way of doing the world's business because  of the development of the means of communication and information. The  embassy in a foreign country, as a watching, remonstrating, proposing  extension of its country of origin, a sort of eye and finger at the  heart of the host country, is now clumsy, unnecessary, inefficient, and  dangerous. For most routine work, for reports of all sorts, for legal  action, and so forth, on behalf of traveling nationals, the consular  service is adequate, or can easily be made adequate. What remains of the  ambassadorial apparatus might very well merge with the consular system  and the embassy become an international court civility, a ceremonial  vestige without any diplomatic value at all.      IV.    Given a permanent world congress developed out of the congress of  settlement between the belligerents, a world alliance, with as a last  resort a call upon the forces of the associated powers, for dealing with  recalcitrants, then a great number of possibilities open out to humanity  that must otherwise remain inaccessible. But before we go on to consider  these it may be wise to point out how much more likely a world congress  is to effect a satisfactory settlement at the end of this war than a  congress confined to the belligerents.    The war has progressed sufficiently to convince every one that there is  now no possibility of an overwhelming victory for Germany. It must end  in a more or less complete defeat of the German and Turkish alliance,  and in a considerable readjustment of Austrian and Turkish boundaries.  Assisted by the generosity of the doomed Austrians and Turks, the  Germans are fighting now to secure a voice as large as possible in the  final settlement, and it is conceivable that in the end that settlement  may be made quite an attractive one for Germany proper by the crowning  sacrifice of suicide on the part of her two subordinated allies.    There can be little doubt that Russia will gain the enormous advantage  of a free opening into the Mediterranean and that the battle of the  Marne turned the fortunes of France from disaster to expansion. But the  rest of the settlement is still vague and uncertain, and German  imperialism, at least, is already working hard and intelligently for a  favorable situation at the climax, a situation that will enable this  militarist empire to emerge still strong, still capable of recuperation  and of a renewal at no very remote date of the struggle for European  predominance. This is a thing as little for the good of the saner German  people as it is for the rest of the world, but it is the only way in  which militant imperialism can survive at all.    The alternative of an imperialism shorn of the glamour of aggression,  becoming constitutional and democratic--the alternative, that is to say,  of a great liberal Germany--is one that will be as distasteful almost to  the people who control the destinies of Germany today, and who will  speak and act for Germany in the final settlement, as a complete  submission to a Serbian conqueror would be.    At the final conference of settlement Germany will not be really  represented at all. The Prussian militarist empire will still be in  existence, and it will sit at the council, working primarily for its own  survival. Unless the Allies insist upon the presence of representatives  of Saxony, Bavaria, and so forth, and demand the evidence of popular  sanctions--a thing they are very unlikely to demand--that is what  \"Germany\" will signify at the conference. And what is true of Germany  will be true, more or less, of several other of the allied powers.    A conference confined purely to the belligerents will be, in fact, a  conference not even representative of the belligerents. And it will be  tainted with all the traditional policies, aggressions, suspicions, and  subterfuges that led up to the war. It will not be the end of the old  game, but the readjustment of the old game, the old game which is such  an abominable nuisance to the development of modern civilization. The  idealism of the great alliance will certainly be subjected to enormous  strains, and the whole energy of the Central European diplomatists will  be directed to developing and utilizing these stresses.    This, I think, must be manifest even to the foreign offices most  concerned. They must see already ahead of them a terrible puzzle of  arrangement, a puzzle their own bad traditions will certainly never  permit them to solve. \"God save us,\" they may very well pray, \"from our  own cleverness and sharp dealing,\" and they may even welcome the promise  of an enlarged outlook that the entry of the neutral powers would bring  with it.    Every foreign office has its ugly, evil elements, and probably every  foreign office dreads those elements. There are certainly Russian fools  who dream about India, German fools who dream about Canada and South  America, British fools who dream about Africa and the East;  aggressionists in the blood, people who can no more let nations live in  peace than kleptomaniacs can keep their hands in their own pockets. But  quite conceivably there are honest monarchs and sane foreign ministers  very ready to snatch at the chance of swamping the evil in their own  Chancelleries.    It is just here that the value of neutral participation will come in.  Whatever ambitions the neutral powers "]]]
