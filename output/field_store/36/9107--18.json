The land around here  from the train appears to be a dry, salty country, devoid of herbage,  and only valuable on account of the excellent forest trees and timber.    Our morning meal was taken in the station waiting-room (the only  restaurant in the town), and consisted of cold coffee and what the  Argentine understands by boiled eggs, which have in reality been in  boiling water half a minute, and which, in order to eat, one has to tip  into a wine-glass and beat up with a fork, adding pepper and salt, etc.  This is the general way of eating eggs in South America; an egg cup is  one of the few things one cannot get in the country without going to an  English store in Buenos Aires.    Leaving Vera at 8 a.m. the train goes at a snail's pace along the branch  line to Reconquista, covering the distance of about thirty leagues in  five hours. Arriving there in the sweltering midday heat, we were met by  an English friend and his capataz, the latter dressed in his enormous  slouch hat, deerskin apron, and silver spurs weighing probably a full  kilo.    One cannot help noticing at once the different type of natives; from the  slow, slouching, don't-care kind of men, which one sees in Cordoba and  Southern Santa Fe, to the quick, straight, hawk-eyed half-Indian  Chaquenos.    Reconquista on a hot summer's day is one of the dirtiest places on this  earth, which is saying a good deal. One drives through streets two feet  deep in light sandy dust, which hangs in clouds all over the town. There  is an excellent hotel in the centre of the town, built on typical  Spanish plans with fine large open patios, which are filled with  splendid tropical plants and ferns. Having washed off the dust of three  days' travel from our weary persons, and having changed into more  suitable travelling gear, we sat down to an excellent spread.    In the cool of the evening we made a tour of the town, being most  interested in the cigar factories, where we bought excellent smokes for  $2 a hundred, all hand-made from pure tobacco leaf by the brown-hued  lasses of Reconquista.    The rest of the evening we spent in unpacking our native saddles, and  preparing everything for our long horseback journey--not having  forgotten to see that our tropilla of fifteen grey ponies were fit and  ready to make an early start next morning.    Three a.m. next morning found us out in the \"corrales\" having our ponies  allotted to us by the capataz--we found the tropilla on \"ronda\"--that  is, in a corner with a lasso tied across in front of them, the height of  their chests, and all facing outwards. This is the most general way of  teaching horses to stand in the Chaco, as, if taught to stand singly,  they would fall too easy a prey to the Indians and gauchos. In order to  saddle these ponies we had to \"manear\" them, that is, tie their forelegs  together, for without this they refused to let us put the blankets on  their backs.    All being ready, we started off, four of us, two in front and two  behind, with eleven loose ponies between us. By this time the sky was  beginning to grow light, and evidently the fresh morning air had  disagreed with my friend T.'s horse, which suddenly cleared down a side  street with his head between his forelegs and his back arched like the  bend in an archer's bow.    After some seconds of this amusing sight T. managed to get the pony's  head up and came along again, looking very warm and beaming; his  pink-nosed pony quite satisfied that he would have to carry more than  his own weight for some distance further.    Leaving Reconquista on the north we crossed, over an old railway  embankment, a large stretch of low country, through which a small stream  glided with winding course, and jogging along league after league we  gradually got into more interesting country: little clumps of trees with  very thick undergrowth, clinging creepers, bright-coloured flowers, and  gorgeously plumaged birds.    All along the sides of the roads were little farms, apparently  uncultivated, except for small patches of wonderfully grown maize and  browning linseed. Practically all these farms are owned by Swiss and  German peasants, each one with his small herd of cows and working  bullocks.    We changed our ponies every three or four leagues, always going at the  same jog-trot, stopping occasionally at a wayside inn to wet our parched  throats with fresh well water (with a drop of cana in it to kill the  microbes), and smoking hard all the time to keep off the swarms of  mosquitoes.    After travelling ten leagues or so we began to leave these habitations  behind us, and got into wilder country with no fences, only long  stretches of undulating land, dotted with patches of splendid-looking  trees and enticing shade.    The road occasionally crossed small streams, which gradually became more  tropical looking, until we came to quite a large river, two or three  hundred metres wide, looking beautifully peaceful and oily. Standing  above on the bank, in the shade of some magnificent quebracho trees, we  looked down upon this lazy stretch of perfect scenery, when suddenly  there was a slight disturbance in the water and a small black dot  appeared on the top of the water. The capataz at once pulled out his  revolver, all of us doing likewise, only to have to put them back again,  as the dot had disappeared as quickly as it came. This was the first  sign of wild animal life we saw, the \"jacare\" or alligator. In the more  civilised parts of the Chaco, these animals, as well as the carpincho or  water-hog, are getting quite rare, and having been so much shot at and  worried they need the most careful stalking.    As we got further away, we came upon many more of these streams, all  looking much the same; some had bridges over them made of quebracho  logs, laid endways on and covered with earth, very dangerous to cross  after wet weather or floods, especially at night, as they are generally  full of holes where the earth has fallen in.    At 10 a.m. each day we unsaddled for lunch, which was generally composed  of \"charque\" or salted beef, biscuits, and coffee. The first night we  slept at the last habitation which we saw, a small wayside inn. Arriving  there late in the evening, we had the greatest difficulty in obtaining  entrance on account of the chorus of barking, snapping dogs, and on  account of the innkeeper's fear of drunken gauchos.    Another early start on the second day saw us well on our journey by  siesta time, which we spent on the edge of a very fine forest. The  afternoon was very hot, and we did not start off again until 4 o'clock.  During the evening we swam across a small river which we found  overflowing its banks on account of the local rains, and, as darkness  fell, we found it almost impossible to see our way on account of the  fireflies, which made such a glare in front of us that the slight track  which we had been following was almost invisible. It was a very dark  night, and once or twice we felt rain. We had to go very slowly, so that  we should not miss the track. Thus we trotted on in Indian file, each of  us now leading spare horses, in silence, except when one of us asked how  many leagues it was to the estancia, only to jog on again for what  seemed two or three hours, until almost midnight. With a cheerful yell  we suddenly came on a barbed wire fence, and after hunting about for a  time, a wire gate.    Immediately tongues seemed to be mechanically loosened and the  conversation flowed freely, discussing the ride, horses, coming  stiffness, and all the things that one has to talk about after two and  a-half days in the saddle. On reaching the estancia about 2 a.m., none  of us needed much bed, and throwing our things down on the grass  outside, we soon were dreaming of alligators, broken bridges, swimming  rivers, etc.    About 10 o'clock the next morning I awoke to find myself on a most neat  little estancia high up on a hill, overlooking, across a slight valley,  magnificent forests where one could see the glint of running water.    The house was brick floored and had four very nice rooms, which had been  colour-washed by my friends with excellent success. The ceilings at once  attracted attention, being of a deep-coloured black wood, well oiled and  seasoned. \"Timbo\" it is called, and is the best carving and furniture  wood in the country.    Out in the garden were oranges, lemons, citrons, pomegranates, limes,  and all kinds of luxurious fruits and vegetables. In a small fenced  paddock at the end of the garden, were sweet potatoes, pea-nuts, cotton,  tobacco, and some magnificent maize.    The men's huts were made of mud over a cane network, and the roofs were  made of split palm trees, hollowed out and made in the form of a large  ~~~~~~~ the palms being placed concavely and convexly alternately,  making fine drainage for the heavy rains. The whole place was surrounded  by a ring of fine chaco paraiso trees and \"ombu.\" The horse corrals were  all _palo a pique_, that is, made of solid posts, stuck in close  together side by side, and about two metres high, with no wire.    The camp was more or less on the real banks of the Parana, sloping away  to the river four leagues away, and forming one of the most fertile  spots in the Republic. This low-lying land is the finest and cheapest  grazing in the north, but it is unreliable because it is quite inundated  in time of floods, when the cattle have to be withdrawn to higher camp.    During various excursions on the following days we saw tracks of  \"tigers\" (leopard) and \"lions\" (puma); the kill of the latter, a small  gazelle buck, \"guasuncho,\" we found neatly covered up with grass and  leaves, and easily distinguishable from the tiger's kill, which is  always left uncovered. A very fine tiger's skin was brought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#16)"],[1,"for the      Vision of Ezekiel, ranks among the Arcana Judaica, which are not      to be told save to the initiated.    Four men entered Paradise--these are their names:--Ben Azai, Ben Zoma,  Acher, and Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva thus warned his companions: \"When  you come across pavements of pellucid marble, do not cry out 'Water!  water!' for it is said (Ps. ci. 7), 'He that uttereth falsehood shall  not dwell in my sight.'\" Ben Azai looked and died; concerning him the  Scripture says (Ps. cxvi. 15), \"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the  death of his saints.\" Ben Zoma looked and went out of his mind; of him  the Scripture says (Prov. xxv. 16), \"Hast thou found honey? eat only so  much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith and vomit  it.\" Acher cut the plants. Only Akiva departed in peace.    _Chaggigah_, fol. 14, col. 2.        Rashi explains this by saying these men went up to heaven; but      Maimonides much more rationally teaches that the Paradise or      garden here is merely the retreat of profound philosophic      meditation. These five intuitions were;--(1.) To know that there      is a God; (2.) to ignore every other beside Him; (3.) to feel      His unity; (4.) to love His person; and (5.) to stand in awe of      His Majesty (see Vad Hachaz, chap. 4, sec. 19). Deep thought in      these matters was spoken of by the Rabbis as _promenading in the      garden_.    Four times a year is the world subject to an ordeal of judgment:--At  Passover, which is decisive of the fruits of the field; at Pentecost,  which is decisive of the fruits of the garden; at the feast of  Tabernacles, which is decisive in respect of rain; on New Year's Day,  when all who come into the world pass before the Lord like sheep, as it  is said (Ps. xxxiii. 15), \"Who formed their hearts together; who  understandeth all their works.\"    _Rosh Hashanah_, fol. 16, col. 1.    There are four varieties of cedar:--Erez, Karthom, Etz-Shemen, and  Berosh.    Ibid., fol. 23, col. 1.    Ben Kamzar would not teach the art of writing, and yet it is related of  him that he could, by taking four pens between his fingers, write off a  word of four letters at one stroke.    _Yoma_, fol. 38, col. 2.    There are four kinds of quails:--Sichli, Kibli, Pisyoni, and the common  quail. The first was of superior quality, and the last inferior.    Ibid., fol. 75, col. 2.    A man may obtain forgiveness after the third transgression, but if he  repeat the offense a fourth time, he is not pardoned again; for it is  said (Amos ii. 4), \"For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I  will not turn away the punishment thereof;\" and again (Job xxxiii. 29),  \"Lo! all these things doth God two or three times\" (and so inferentially  not four times) \"with man to bring back his soul from the pit.\"    _Yoma_, fol. 86, col. 2.    For four reasons does their property pass out of the hands of the  avaricious:--Because they are backward in paying the wages of their  hired servants; because they altogether neglect their welfare; because  they shift the yoke from themselves and lay the burden upon their  neighbors; and because of pride, which is of itself as bad as all the  rest put together; whereas of the meek it is written (Ps. xxxvii. n),  \"The meek shall inherit the earth.\"    _Succah_, fol. 29, col. 2.    \"And the Lord showed me four carpenters\" (Zech. i, 20). Who are these  four carpenters? Rav Ghana bar Bizna says that Rabbi Shimon Chassida  said they were Messiah the son of David, Messiah the son of Joseph,  Elijah, and the Priest of Righteousness.    Ibid., fol. 52, col. 2.    No Synagogue is to be sold except on condition that there be power of  re-purchase. These are the words of Rabbi Meir; but the sages say it may  be sold unconditionally, except in these four particular cases: that it  be not turned into a bath-house, a tannery, a wash-house, or a laundry.    _Meggillah_, fol. 27, col. 2.    Rabbi Yochanan ben Zachai was once asked by his disciples how he had  attained such length of days. \"Never once,\" he said, \"in my life have I  acted irreverently within four cubits of a place where prayer is  offered; never have I called a person by a wicked name; nor have I ever  failed to sanctify the Sabbath over a cup of wine. Once my aged mother  sold her head-dress to buy the consecration wine for me.\"    Ibid., fol. 27, col. 2.    When a sage is approaching, one should rise up before he gets within  four ells' distance, and remain standing until he has gone as far past.  When a chief magistrate is about to pass, one must rise as soon as he  comes in sight, and not resume the seat until he has passed four ells.  When a prince passes, one must stand up whenever he appears, and not sit  down again until the prince himself is seated; for it is said (Exod.  xxxiii, 8), \"All the people rose up, ... and looked after Moses until he  was gone into the tabernacle.\"    _Kiddushin_, fol. 33, col. 2.    When Nero came to the Holy Land, he tried his fortune by belemnomancy  thus:--He shot an arrow eastward, and it fell upon Jerusalem; he  discharged his shafts towards the four points of the compass, and every  time they fell upon Jerusalem. After this he met a Jewish boy, and said  unto him, \"Repeat to me the text thou hast learned to-day.\" The boy  repeated, \"I will lay my vengeance upon Edom (i.e., Rome) by the hand of  my people Israel\" (Ezek. xxv. 14). Then said Nero, \"The Holy  One--blessed be He!--has determined to destroy His Temple and then  avenge Himself on the agent by whom its ruin is wrought.\" Thereupon Nero  fled and became a Jewish proselyte, and Rabbi Meir is of his race.    _Gittin_, fol. 56, col. 1.    They whose banquet is accompanied with four kinds of instruments of  music bring five calamities on the world; as it is said (Isa. v. 11-15),  \"Woe unto those that get up early in the morning, that they may run  after strong drink; and continue until late at night, till flushed with  wine. And the harp and psaltery, tambourine and flute, and wine are at  their carousals.\"    _Soteh_, fol. 48, col. 1.    Let him carry the purse, and halt every time he accomplishes less than  four cubits forward.    _Shabbath_, fol. 153, cols, 1, 2.        Rav Yitzchak here explains how the good Jew, belated on      Sabbath-eve, may carry his purse himself, and so save his      conscience. The traveler is to halt at about every other step,      and so measure off the journey in four-cubit stages.    Though ever since the destruction of the Temple the Sanhedrin has ceased  to exist, the four kinds of capital punishment have not failed to assert  themselves. If a man incurs the penalty of death by stoning, he is in  the course of Providence either punished by a fatal fall from a roof or  slain by some beast of prey; if he has exposed himself to the penalty of  death by burning, it happens that he is either burned to death in the  end or mortally stung by a serpent; if the penalty of the law is that he  should be beheaded for his offense, he meets his death either from the  Government officer or by the hand of an assassin; if the penalty be  strangulation, he is sure to be drowned or suffocated.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 37, col. 2.    When a person is in a state of apprehension and cannot make out the  cause of it (the star that presided at his birth and his genii know all  about it), what should he do? Let him jump from where he is standing  four cubits, or else let him repeat, \"Hear, O Israel,\" etc. (Deut. vi.  4); or if the place be unfit for the repetition of Scripture, let him  mutter to himself, \"The goat at the butcher's is fatter than me.\"    Ibid., fol. 94, col. 1.    It is written in 2 Chron. xxxiii. 7, \"A carved image;\" and again it is  written in verse 19, \"Graven images.\" Rabbi Yochanan said, \"At first he  made the image with one face, but afterwards he made it with four--four,  so that the Shechinah might see it from every point, and thus be  exasperated.\"    Ibid., fol. 103, col. 2.    Moses uttered four judgments upon Israel, but four prophets revoked  them:--(1.) First Moses said (Deut. xxxiii. 28), \"Israel then shall  dwell in safety alone;\" then came Amos and set it aside (Amos vii. 5),  \"Cease, I beseech thee,\" etc.; and then it is written (verse 6), \"This  shall not be, saith the Lord.\" (2.) First Moses said (Deut. xxviii. 65),  \"Among these nations thou shalt find no ease;\" then came Jeremiah and  set this saying aside (Jer. xxxi. 2), \"Even Israel, when I went to cause  him to rest.\" (3.) First Moses said (Exod. xxxiv. 7), \"Visiting the  iniquities of the fathers upon the children;\" then came Ezekiel and set  this aside (Ezek. xviii. 4), \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die.\" (4.)  First Moses said (Lev. xxvi. 38), \"And ye shall perish among the  heathen;\" then came Isaiah and reversed this (Isa. xxvii. 13), \"And it  shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown,  and they shall come which were ready to perish.\"    _Maccoth_, fol. 24, col. 1.    When Akavyah ben Mahalalel appeared to four halachahs contradicting the  judgment of the wise on a certain important point of law, \"Retract,\"  they said, \"and we will promote thee to be president of the tribunal.\"  To which he replied, \"I would rather be called a fool all the days of my  life than be judged wicked for one hour before Him who is omnipresent.\"    _Edioth_, chap. 5, mish. 6.    Let thy house be open wide toward the south, the east, the west, and the  north, just as Job, who made four entrances to his house, in order that  the poor might find entrance without trouble from whatever quarter they  might come.    _Avoth d'Rav. Nathan_, chap. 7,    Rabbah once saw a sea-monster on the day it was brought forth, and it  was as large as Mount Tabor. And how large is Mount Tabor? Its neck was  three miles long, and where it laid its head a mile and a half. Its dung  choked up the Jordan, till, as Rashi says, its waters washed it away.    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 73, col. 2."]]]
