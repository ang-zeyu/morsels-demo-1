Still there are walking on earth many poets whom ages hereafter    Will be more willing to praise than they are to praise one another:    Some do I know, but I fear, as is meet, to recount or report them,    For, be whatever the name that is foremost, the next will run over,    Trampling and rolling in dust his excellent friend the precursor.    Peace be with all! but afar be ambition to follow the Roman,    Led by the German, uncomb'd, and jigging in dactyl and spondee,    Lumbering shapeless jackboots which nothing can polish or supple.

A great deal has been said about the prowess of Nimrod, in connection  with the chase, from the days of him of Babylon to those of the late  Mr. Apperley of Shropshire; but we question whether, among all the  sporting characters mentioned in ancient or modern story, there ever  was so mighty a hunter as the gentleman whose sporting calendar  now lies before us.[4] The annals of the chase, so far as we are  acquainted with them, supply no such instances of familiar intimacy  with lions, elephants, hippopotami, rhinoceroses, serpents,  crocodiles, and other furious animals, with which the human species  in general is not very forward in cultivating an acquaintance.    [Footnote 4: A Hunter's Life in South Africa. By R. Gordon Cumming,  Esq., of Altyre.]    Mr. Cumming had exhausted the deer-forests of his native Scotland;  he had sighed for the rolling prairies and rocky mountains of the Far  West, and was tied down to military routine as a mounted rifleman in  the Cape Colony; when he determined to resign his commission into the  hands of Government, and himself to the delights of hunting amid the  untrodden plains and forests of South Africa. Having provided himself  with wagons to travel and live in, with bullocks to draw them, and  with a host of attendants; a sufficiency of arms, horses, dogs, and  ammunition, he set out from Graham's-Town in October, 1843. From that  period his hunting adventures extended over five years, during which  time he penetrated from various points and in various directions from  his starting-place in lat. 33 down to lat. 20, and passed through  districts upon which no European foot ever before trod; regions where  the wildest of wild animals abound--nothing less serving Mr. Cumming's  ardent purpose.    A lion story in the early part of his book will introduce this  fearless hunter-author to our readers better than the most elaborate  dissection of his character. He is approaching Colesberg, the  northernmost military station belonging to the Cape Colony. He is on  a trusty steed, which he calls also \"Colesberg.\" Two of his attendants  on horseback are with him. \"Suddenly,\" says the author, \"I observed  a number of vultures seated on the plain about a quarter of a mile  ahead of us, and close beside them stood a huge lioness, consuming  a blesblok which she had killed. She was assisted in her repast by  about a dozen jackals, which were feasting along with her in the most  friendly and confidential manner. Directing my followers' attention to  the spot, I remarked, 'I see the lion;' to which they replied, 'Whar?  whar? Yah! Almagtig! dat is he;' and instantly reining in their steeds  and wheeling about, they pressed their heels to their horses' sides,  and were preparing to betake themselves to flight. I asked them what  they were going to do? To which they answered, 'We have not yet placed  caps on our rifles.' This was true; but while this short conversation  was passing, the lioness had observed us. Raising her full round  face, she overhauled us for a few seconds, and then set off at a smart  canter toward a range of mountains some miles to the northward; the  whole troop of jackals also started off in another direction; there  was therefore no time to think of caps. The first move was to bring  her to bay, and not a second was to be lost. Spurring my good and  lively steed, and shouting to my men to follow, I flew across the  plain, and, being fortunately mounted on Colesberg, the flower of  my stud, I gained upon her at every stride. This was to me a joyful  moment, and I at once made up my mind that she or I must die. The  lioness soon after suddenly pulled up, and sat on her haunches like  a dog, with her back toward me, not even deigning to look round. She  then appeared to say to herself, 'Does this fellow know who he is  after?' Having thus sat for half a minute, as if involved in thought,  she sprang to her feet, and facing about, stood looking at me for a  few seconds, moving her tail slowly from side to side, showing her  teeth and growling fiercely. She next made a short run forward, making  a loud, rumbling noise like thunder. This she did to intimidate  me; but finding that I did not flinch an inch, nor seem to heed her  hostile demonstrations, she quietly stretched out her massive arms,  and lay down on the grass. My Hottentots now coming up, we all three  dismounted, and drawing our rifles from their holsters, we looked to  see if the powder was up in the nipples, and put on our caps. While  this was doing, the lioness sat up, and showed evident symptoms of  uneasiness. She looked first at us, and then behind her, as if to see  if the coast were clear; after which she made a short run toward us,  uttering her deep-drawn murderous growls. Having secured the three  horses to one another by their rheims, we led them on as if we  intended to pass her, in the hope of obtaining a broadside; but this  she carefully avoided to expose, presenting only her full front. I had  given Stofolus my Moore rifle, with orders to shoot her if she should  spring upon me, but on no account to fire before me. Kleinboy was to  stand ready to hand me my Purdey rifle, in case the two-grooved Dixon  should not prove sufficient. My men as yet had been steady, but  they were in a precious stew, their faces having assumed a ghastly  paleness; and I had a painful feeling that I could place no reliance  on them. Now, then, for it, neck or nothing! She is within sixty yards  of us, and she keeps advancing. We turned the horses' tails to her.  I knelt on one side, and taking a steady aim at her breast, let fly.  The ball cracked loudly on her tawny hide, and crippled her in the  shoulder; upon which she charged with an appalling roar, and in  the twinkling of an eye she was in the midst of us. At this moment  Stofolus'a rifle exploded in his hand, and Kleinboy, whom I had  ordered to stand ready by me, danced about like a duck in a gale of  wind. The lioness sprang upon Colesberg, and fearfully lacerated his  ribs and haunches with her horrid teeth and claws. The worst wound was  on his haunch, which exhibited a sickening, yawning gash, more than  twelve inches long, almost laying bare the very bone. I was very  cool and steady, and did not feel in the least degree nervous, having  fortunately great confidence in my own shooting; but I must confess,  when the whole affair was over, I felt that it was a very awful  situation, and attended with extreme peril, as I had no friend with  me on whom I could rely. When the lioness sprang on Colesberg, I  stood out from the horses, ready with my second barrel for the first  chance she should give me of a clear shot. This she quickly did; for,  seemingly satisfied with the revenge she had now taken, she quitted  Colesberg, and slewing her tail to one side, trotted sulkily past  within a few paces of me, taking one step to the left. I pitched my  rifle to my shoulder, and in another second the lioness was stretched  on the plain a lifeless corpse.\"    This is, however, but a harmless adventure compared with a subsequent  escapade--not with one, but with six lions. It was the hunter's habit  to lay wait near the drinking-places of these animals, concealed in a  hole dug for the purpose. In such a place on the occasion in question,  Mr. Cumming--having left one of three rhinoceroses he had previously  killed as a bait--ensconsed himself. Such a savage festival as that  which introduced the adventure, has never before, we believe, been  introduced through the medium of the softest English and the finest  hot-pressed paper to the notice of the civilized public. \"Soon after  twilight,\" the author relates, \"I went down to my hole with Kleinboy  and two natives, who lay concealed in another hole, with Wolf and  Boxer ready to slip, in the event of wounding a lion. On reaching  the water I looked toward the carcase of the rhinoceros, and, to  my astonishment, I beheld the ground alive with large creatures,  as though a troop of zebras were approaching the fountain to drink.  Kleinboy remarked to me that a troop of zebras were standing on the  height. I answered, 'Yes,' but I knew very well that zebras would not  be capering around the carcase of a rhinoceros. I quickly arranged my  blankets, pillow, and guns in the hole, and then lay down to feast my  eyes on the interesting sight before me. It was bright moonlight, as  clear as I need wish, and within one night of being full moon. There  were six large lions, about twelve or fifteen hyenas, and from twenty  to thirty jackals, feasting on and around the carcases of the three  rhinoceroses. The lions feasted peacefully, but the hyenas and jackals  fought over every mouthful, and chased one another round and round  the carcases, growling, laughing, screeching, chattering, and howling  without any intermission. The hyenas did not seem afraid of the lions,  although they always gave way before them; for I observed that they  followed them in the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13722"],[0,"Youth and Sex: Dangers and Safeguards for Girls and Boys (#16)"],[1,"house, Glos.]    Some into whose hands this book may come and who have boys of twelve  and upwards to whom they have never given instruction, may possibly be  glad of advice as to the manner in which the subject can best be dealt  with in their case. For boys of this age, I am strongly of opinion  that it is better in most cases to make use of a pamphlet than to  attempt oral instruction. Probably they already have some knowledge on  the subject; possibly some sense of guilt. If so, it will be found  very difficult to treat the matter orally without embarrassment--a  thing to be avoided at all costs. I was interested to find that on  receipt of my pamphlet Professor Geddes--one of the greatest experts  on sex--placed it at once in the hands of his own boy, a fact from  which his opinion on the relative merits of oral and printed  instruction can easily be inferred.    Many of my readers who have boys of fourteen and upwards to whom they  have hitherto given no instruction will, I hope, feel that they must  now do this. I venture, therefore, to give a detailed account of the  manner in which I should myself act in similar circumstances. I should  arrange to be with the lad when there was no danger of interruption,  and in such circumstances as would put him at his ease. I should tell  him that I was conscious of unwisdom in not speaking to him before  about a subject of supreme importance to him; that I took upon myself  all blame for anything he might, in ignorance, have said or done; that  through ignorance I had myself fallen and suffered, and that I should  like him now to sit down and read through this pamphlet slowly and  carefully. When he finished I should try by every possible means to  make him sensible of my affection for him. I should associate myself  in a few words with the sentiments of the writer, and should invite  the lad to tell me whether he had fallen into temptation, and if so to  what extent. A confidence of this kind assists a boy greatly and  establishes a delightful intimacy.    There are several points with regard to purity-teaching which need to  be emphasised.    Such teaching can hardly be too explicit. \"Beating about the bush\" is  always indicative of the absence of self-possession. The embarrassment  manifested is quickly perceived even by a young child, and is certain  to communicate itself to the recipient. It is of paramount importance  that the child should, from the first, feel that the knowledge  imparted is pure; anything which suggests that it is indelicate should  be studiously avoided. The introduction of a few science terms is  advantageous in several ways: amongst others it relieves the tension  which the spiritual aspect of the question may engender, it gives a  lad a terminology which is free from filthy contamination.    It is important that the information given should be full, otherwise  the boy lives in a chronic state of curiosity, which, to his great  detriment, he is ever trying to satisfy. If the reader feels that the  information is dangerous, and aims, therefore, at imparting as little  as possible, he is not fitted to do the work at all.    No greater mistake can be made than that of taxing a boy with impurity  as though it were a conscious and egregious fault. I have already  expressed my strong opinion that, in almost every instance, the boy is  a victim to be sympathised with, not a culprit to be punished. This  opinion is shared, I believe, by everyone who has investigated the  subject. It is certainly the opinion of Canon Lyttelton and Dr. Dukes.  It is, indeed, easy to exaggerate the conscious guilt even of boys who  have initiated others into masturbation. Apart from the injustice to  the boy of an attitude of severity, it is certain to shut the boy's  heart up with a snap.    If a pamphlet is used it should, without fail, be taken from a boy  when he has read it. Much harm may, I fear, result from supplying boys  with the cheap pamphlets which well-meaning but inexperienced persons  are producing.    Should the time ever come when parents give timely warning and  instruction to boys, a very difficult problem will be solved for the  schoolmaster. But in the meantime what ought the schoolmaster to do?  The following plan commends itself to some eminent teachers. As soon  as a boy is about to enter the school a letter is sent to his parents  advising them to give the boy instruction, and a pamphlet is enclosed  for this purpose. This plan has the decided advantage of shifting the  responsibility on to the shoulders of those who ought to take it. The  weakness of the plan arises from the fact that most parents do not  believe in the prevalence of impurity among boys, and are quite  confident that their own boys need no warning. Hence they may do  nothing at all, or merely content themselves with some vague and quite  useless statement.    The traditions of most boys' schools make it impossible for those  intimate and respectful relations to exist between masters and boys  without which confidential teaching of this kind may be even worse  than useless. Where masters are invariably referred to disrespectfully  if not contemptuously, where a teacher's most earnest address is a  \"jaw\" which the recipient is expected to betray and mock at with his  companions; where to shield profanity, indecency, and bullying from  detection is the imperative duty of every boy below the Sixth; where  failure to avert from a moral leper the kindly treatment which might  restore him to health and prevent the wholesale infection of others is  the one unpardonable sin, only one or two teachers of a generation can  hope to do much, and the risk of failure is immense. I can hardly  believe that the present race of teachers will long tolerate the  system I here advert to. Public opinion _can_ be organised and  enlisted as strongly on the side of Right as it is now, but too often,  on the side of Evil. Mr. A.C. Benson is very moderate when he writes:  \"To take no steps to arrive at such an organisation, and to leave it  severely alone, is a very dark responsibility.\"    Even in such a school, some good is, I know, done by tactful public  references to the existence of masturbation and to its deplorable  consequences.    The question is not free from difficulty even when the general  atmosphere of the school is healthy and helpful. If one dared to leave  this instruction until the age of puberty, the lad would be capable of  a much deeper impression than he is at an earlier age, and the  impression would be fresh just at the time at which it is most needed.  In the case of boys who have come to me at nine or ten I have  sometimes ventured to defer my interview for four or five years, and  have found them quite uncorrupted. On the other hand, within an hour  of penning these lines I have been talking to a little boy of eleven  who commenced masturbation two years ago while he was under excellent  home influence. One such boy may, without guilt, corrupt a whole set,  for impurity is one of the most infectious as well as the most  terrible of diseases. The ideal state in a school is not reached until  periodical addresses on purity can be given to all with the certainty  that by all they will be listened to and treated reverently and  respectfully. Such addresses cannot well be made the vehicle of sex  information, but they can be so constructed as to guide those to whom  individual instruction has not yet been given, and to strengthen those  who, spite of full instruction, periodically need a helping hand.    What results may we reasonably expect from adequate and timely  instruction? I have so rarely met a case in which this has been given  at home that I can only infer what these results might be from the  cases in which my own instruction has been given in time. In almost  every instance I feel sure that the results have been beneficial,  that the temptation to impurity has been little felt, and that a  healthy and chaste boyhood has resulted. Canon Lyttelton writes: \"The  influences of school life have been found to be impotent to deprave  the tone of a boy who has been fortified by the right kind of  instruction from his parents.\" This I can well believe, for, if the  schoolmaster can do much, there can be no limit to a power which has  been cradled in the sanctity of home and cherished by a mother's love.  This appears to be the emphatic opinion also of Dr. Dukes. Of a boy  thus favoured, Canon Lyttelton writes: \"He will feel that any rude  handling of such a theme, even of only its outer fringe, is like the  profaning of the Holy of Holies in his heart, and he will no more  suffer it than he would suffer a stranger to defile the innermost  shrine of his feelings by taking his mother's or his sister's name in  vain. All the goading curiosity which drives other boys to pry  greedily into nature's laws, in blank ignorance of their mighty  import, their unspeakable depth, and spiritual unearthly harmonies,  has been for him forestalled, enlightened, and purified.\"    It is a sad step down from such a boy to the lad who has been given  warning after corruption has begun. Most boys feel such shame in  confessing to failure that one has to accept with reserve the  statements made by even the most truthful of those who are treading  the upward path. After making due allowance for this source of error,  my experience enables me to say confidently that, if a boy has not  been long or badly corrupted, a radical change of attitude may be  expected in him at once, and the habit of self-abuse will be instantly  or rapidly relinquished. Very different is the case of a lad who has  long practised masturbation, or who has practised it for some time  after the advent of puberty, or who has associated sexual imaginations  with the practice. Few such boys conquer the habit at once, however  much they desire to, and, if the above conditions co-exist, a boy's  progress is very slow, and years"]]]
