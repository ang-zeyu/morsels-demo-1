XXXIX. CONSEQUENCES OF IDLENESS. (110)    1. Many young persons seem to think it of not much consequence if they do  not improve their time well in youth, vainly expecting that they can make  it up by diligence when they are older. They also think it is disgraceful  for men and women to be idle, but that there can be no harm for persons  who are young to spend their time in any manner they please.    2. George Jones thought so. When he was twelve years old, he went to an  academy to prepare to enter college. His father was at great expense in  obtaining books for him, clothing him, and paying his tuition. But George  was idle. The preceptor of the academy would often tell him that if he did  not study diligently when young he would never succeed well.    3. But George thought of nothing but present pleasure. He would often go  to school without having made any preparation for his morning lesson; and,  when called to recite with his class, he would stammer and make such  blunders that the rest of the class could not help laughing at him. He was  one of the poorest scholars in the school, because he was one of the most  idle.    4. When recess came, and all the boys ran out of the academy upon the  playground, idle George would come moping along. Instead of studying  diligently while in school, he was indolent and half asleep. When the  proper time for play came, he had no relish for it. I recollect very well,  that, when \"tossing up\" for a game of ball, we used to choose everybody on  the playground before we chose George; and if there were enough without  him we used to leave him out. Thus he was unhappy in school and out of  school.    5. There is nothing which makes a person enjoy play so well as to study  hard. When recess was over, and the rest of the boys returned, fresh and  vigorous, to their studies, George might be seen lagging and moping along  to his seat. Sometimes he would be asleep in school; sometimes he would  pass his time in catching flies, and penning them up in little holes,  which he cut in his seat; and sometimes, when the preceptor's back was  turned, he would throw a paper ball across the room.    6. When the class was called up to recite, George would come drowsily  along, looking as mean and ashamed as though he were going to be whipped.  The rest of the class stepped up to the recitation with alacrity, and  appeared happy and contented. When it came George's turn to recite, he  would be so long in doing it, and make such blunders, that all most  heartily wished him out of the class.    7. At last, George went with his class to enter college. Though he passed  a very poor examination, he was admitted with the rest; for those who  examined him thought it was possible that the reason why he did not answer  questions better was because he was frightened. Now came hard times for  poor George. In college there is not much mercy shown to bad scholars; and  George had neglected his studies so long that he could not now keep up  with his class, let him try ever so hard.    8. He could, without much difficulty, get along in the academy, where  there were only two or three boys of his own class to laugh at him. But  now he had to go into a large recitation room, filled with students from  all parts of the country. In the presence of all these, he must rise and  recite to a professor. Poor fellow! He paid dearly for his idleness.    9. You would have pitied him if you could have seen him trembling in his  scat, every moment expecting to be called upon to recite. And when he was  called upon, he would stand up and take what the class called a \"dead  set;\" that is, he could not recite at all. Sometimes he would make such  ludicrous blunders that the whole class would burst into a laugh. Such are  the applauses an idler gets. He was wretched, of course. He had been idle  so long that he hardly knew how to apply his mind to study. All the good  scholars avoided him; they were ashamed to be seen in his company. He  became discouraged, and gradually grew dissipated.    10. The officers of the college were soon compelled to suspend him. He  returned in a few months, but did no better; and his father was then  advised to take him from college. He left college, despised by everyone. A  few months ago, I met him, a poor wanderer, without money and without  friends. Such are the wages of idleness. I hope every reader will, from  this history, take warning, and \"stamp improvement on the wings of time.\"      DEFINITIONS.--1. Con'se-quence, importance, influence. 2.

I gave you, in the last lesson, the history of George Jones, an idle  boy, and showed you the consequences of his idleness. I shall now give you  the history of Charles Bullard, a classmate of George. Charles was about  the same age as George, and did not possess superior talents. Indeed, I  doubt whether he was equal to him in natural powers of mind.    2. But Charles was a hard student. When quite young, he was always careful  and diligent in school. Sometimes, when there was a very hard lesson,  instead of going out to play during recess, he would stay in to study. He  had resolved that his first object should be to get his lessons well, and  then he could play with a good conscience. He loved play as well as  anybody, and was one of the best players on the ground. I hardly ever saw  any boy catch a ball better than he could. When playing any game, everyone  was glad to get Charles on his side.    3. I have said that Charles would sometimes stay in at recess. This,  however, was very seldom; it was only when the lessons were very hard  indeed. Generally, he was among the first on the playground, and he was  also among the first to go into school when called. Hard study gave him a  relish for play, and play again gave him a relish for hard study; so he  was happy both in school and out. The preceptor could not help liking him,  for he always had his lessons well committed, and never gave him any  trouble.    4. When he went to enter college, the preceptor gave him a good  recommendation. He was able to answer all the questions which were put to  him when he was examined. He had studied so well when he was in the  academy, and was so thoroughly prepared for college, that he found it very  easy to keep up with his class, and had much time for reading interesting  books.    5. But he would always get his lesson well before he did anything else,  and would review it just before recitation. When called upon to recite, he  rose tranquil and happy, and very seldom made mistakes. The officers of  the college had a high opinion of him, and he was respected by all the  students.    6. There was, in the college, a society made up of all the best scholars.  Charles was chosen a member of that society. It was the custom to choose  some one of the society to deliver a public address every year. This honor  was conferred on Charles; and he had studied so diligently, and read so  much, that he delivered an address which was very interesting to all who  heard it.    7. At last he graduated, as it is called; that is, he finished his  collegiate course, and received his degree. It was known by all that he  was a good scholar, and by all that he was respected. His father and  mother, brothers and sisters, came on the commencement day to hear him  speak.    8. They all felt gratified, and loved Charles more than ever. Many  situations of usefulness and profit were opened to him; for Charles was  now an intelligent man, and universally respected. He is still a useful  and a happy man. He has a cheerful home, and is esteemed by all who know  him.    9. Such are the rewards of industry. How strange it is that any person  should be willing to live in idleness when it will certainly make him  unhappy! The idle boy is almost invariably poor and miserable; the  industrious boy is happy and prosperous.    10. But perhaps some child who reads this, asks, \"Does God notice little  children in school?\" He certainly does. And if you are not diligent in the  improvement of your time, it is one of the surest evidences that your  heart is not right with God. You are placed in this world to improve your  time. In youth you must be preparing for future usefulness. And if you do  not improve the advantages you enjoy, you sin against your Maker.      With books, or work, or healthful play,    Let your first years be passed;    That you may give, for every day,    Some good account, at last.      DEFINITIONS.--l.

EXERCISES.--What was the character of George "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],[0,"Grandmother Elsie (#16)"],[1,"to look for the pond, and make sure that she was not losing  herself, there were acorn-cups, lovely mosses, beautiful autumn  leaves--red, orange, golden and green; there were wild grapes too, and  hazel-nuts, brown and ripe. Of all these she gathered eagerly until her  basket was full, thinking that some would delight Gracie, others  propitiate Aunt Beulah.    And now she made her way back to the spot where the boys still sat, each  with his line in the water.    \"Have you caught any?\" she asked.    \"Yes,\" said Max, \"I've caught six and Jim has eight. There! I've got  another!\" giving his line a jerk that sent a pretty speckled trout  floundering in the grass.    \"I'll take it off the hook for you,\" said Lulu, springing forward and  dropping on her knees beside it. \"And then you'll let me try, won't you?\"    \"Yes,\" Max answered in a half-reluctant tone, getting up to give her his  place.    \"There are hazel-nuts right over there a little way,\" Lulu said, pointing  with her finger.    \"Oh, then I'll have some!\" cried Max, starting on a run in the direction  indicated.    He came back after a while bringing some in his hat, picked up some  stones, and seating himself near the others, cracked his nuts, sharing  generously with them.    Presently Lulu had her first bite, succeeded in bringing her prize safely  to land, and was quite wild with delight.    Max rejoiced with her, taking brotherly pride in her success.    \"You'll do for a fisherman or fisherwoman,\" he said gayly. \"I sha'n't be  much surprised if you beat me at it one o' these days.\"    Then struck with a sudden unwelcome thought, \"I wonder what time it is!\"  he exclaimed, jumping up from the ground in haste and perturbation. \"Do  you s'pose it's noon yet, Jim?\"    \"Which way's the sun?\" queried the latter, glancing toward the sky; \"it  ought to be right overhead at noon. Why, it's down some toward the west! I  shouldn't wonder if it's as late as two o'clock.\"    \"Two o'clock!\" cried Max in dismay, \"and I was to be back by noon! Won't I  catch it!\" and he began gathering up his fish and fishing-tackle in great  haste, Jim doing likewise, with the remark that he would be late to dinner  and maybe have to go without.    Lulu was giving Max all the assistance in her power, her face full of  sympathy.    \"Max,\" she whispered, hurrying along close at his side as they started on  their homeward way, \"don't let that horrid, cruel, wicked man beat you! I  wouldn't. I'd fight him like anything!\"    Max shook his head. \"'Twouldn't do any good, Lulu; he's so much bigger and  stronger than I am that fighting him would be worse for me than taking the  thrashing quietly.\"    \"I could never do that!\" she said. \"But don't wait for me if you want to  go faster.\"    \"I don't,\" said Max.    \"Well, I b'lieve I'd better make all the haste I can,\" said Jim. \"So  good-by,\" and away he sped.    \"Oh, if papa only knew all about how that brute treats you!\" sighed Lulu.    \"Max, can't we write him a letter?\"    \"I do once in a while, but old Tom always reads it before it goes.\"    \"I wouldn't let him. I'd hide away somewhere to write it, and put it in  the post-office myself.\"    \"I have no chance, he gives me only a sheet of paper at a time, and must  always know what I do with it. It's the same way with my pocket money; so  I can't buy postage-stamps; and I don't know how to direct the letter  either.\"    \"Oh dear! and it's just the same way with me!\" sighed Lulu. \"When will  papa come? I'm just sick to see him and tell him everything!\"    When they reached Mrs. Scrimp's door Max gave Lulu his string of fish,  saying, \"Here, take them, Sis. It's no use for me to keep 'em, for I  shouldn't get a taste; and maybe they'll put her in a good humor with  you.\"    \"Thank you,\" she said. \"O Max, I wish you could eat them yourself!\" Her  eyes were full of tears.    \"I'd rather you'd have 'em; you and Gracie,\" he said cheerfully.  \"Good-by.\"    \"Good-by,\" she returned, looking after him as he hurried away, whistling  as he went.    \"He's whistling to keep his courage up. O Max! poor Max! I wish I could  give that man the worst kind of a flogging!\" Lulu sighed to herself, then  turned and went into the house.    She heard Mrs. Scrimp's voice in the kitchen scolding Ann for letting the  bread burn in the oven. It was an inauspicious moment to appear before  her, but Lulu marched boldly in, holding up her string of fish.    \"See, Aunt Beulah! they're just fresh out of the water, and won't they  make us a nice dinner?\"    \"And they're your favorite fish, ma'am, them pretty speckled trout is,\"  put in Ann, glad to make a diversion in her own favor, as well as to help  Lulu out of a scrape; \"and I'll go right to work to clean 'em and have 'em  ready for the frying-pan in less than no time.\"    \"Yes, they'll be very nice; and the meat will keep for to-morrow,\" was the  gracious rejoinder. \"You oughtn't to have gone off without leave, Lulu;  but I suppose Max couldn't wait.\"    \"No, Aunt Beulah, he said he couldn't stay more than a minute. Shall I  help Ann clean the fish?\"    \"No; go and make yourself tidy. Your hands are dirty, your apron soiled,  and your hair looks as if it hadn't been combed for a week.\"    Mrs. Scrimp's face was gathering blackness as she scanned the figure of  the young delinquent from head to foot, spying out all that was amiss with  it.    \"I will,\" said Lulu, moving toward the door with cheerful alacrity. \"Oh, I  forgot!\" and rushing into the hall, she came back the next minute  bringing her basket of treasures.    \"See, Aunt Beulah, I've brought you lots of lovely leaves; you know you  said you wanted some to make a wreath; and here are mosses, and grapes,  and hazel-nuts.\"    \"Why you have made good use of your time,\" Mrs. Scrimp said, now entirely  mollified. \"Bring your basket into the sitting-room, where Gracie is; and  we'll look over its contents.\"    Max was less fortunate to-day than his sister. His custodian was on the  look-out for him, cowhide in hand, and seizing him roughly, as he entered  the gate, with a fierce, \"I'll teach you to disobey orders another time,  you young vagabond! I told you to come home at noon, and you're over two  hours behind time!\" began to administer an unmerciful flogging.    \"Stop!\" cried Max, trying to dodge the blows. \"How could I tell the time?  I came as soon as I thought it was noon.\"    But his tormentor was in a towering passion and would not stay his hand to  listen to any excuse.    \"Do you mean to kill me?\" screamed Max. \"You'll hang for it if you do. And  my father----\"    \"Your father believes in enforcing obedience to orders, sir; and  I'll----\"    But at this instant there was an interference from a third party.    At a little distance some men were at work hewing timber. They had been  working there for weeks, in which Max had made acquaintance and become a  great favorite with them, particularly one called by his companions, \"Big  Bill,\" because of his great size and strength.    He was a rough, good-natured man, with nothing of the bully about him, but  regarded with intense scorn and indignation any attempt on the part of the  strong to tyrannize over the weak and defenceless.    He and his comrades had seen and heard enough in these weeks of labor in  the vicinity of Fox's residence to inspire them with contempt and dislike  toward him on account of his treatment of Max. They had among themselves  already pronounced him \"a wolf in sheep's clothing, a hypocrite and a  coward.\"    They had seen him watching for the boy with his instrument of torture in  his hand, and their wrath had waxed hot.    When Max came in sight they dropped their tools and looked to see what  would happen, and at the first blow \"Big Bill\" muttering between his  clenched teeth, \"I'll settle his hash for him,\" started for the scene of  action. \"Stop that!\" he roared, \"stop that, you old hypocritical  scoundrel! You hit that boy another lick and I'll knock you as flat as a  flounder!\"    The hand that held the whip dropped at Fox's side, and the other loosed  its hold on Max as he turned and faced his assailant.    \"What do you mean by coming here to interfere in my business?\" he  demanded.    \"I mean to protect the weak against the strong, sir. I consider that my  business. You've given that boy more unmerciful beatings already than he  ought to have had in a lifetime, and he not at all a bad boy either. I  know all about that padlock affair, though he's never breathed a word to  me on the subject, and I'd enjoy nothing better than thrashing you  soundly; what's more I'll do it if ever I know you to strike him again; or  my name's not Bill Simpson. Max, if he ever does, you've only to let 'Big  Bill' hear of it and he'll get ten times more than he's given.\"    \"Thank you, Bill,\" said Max, running to the big, kind-hearted fellow and  giving him his hand. \"I'm glad to be protected from him, though I don't  want him hurt if he'll only let me alone.\"    Fox had already stalked away in the direction of the house, swelling with  inward wrath, but assuming an air of injured innocence and offended  dignity.    Standing in wholesome fear of Max's self-constituted defender, he never  again ventured to lay violent hands on the lad, but contented himself with  inflicting many petty annoyances.          CHAPTER XII.        \"Except I be by Silvia in the night,       There is no music in the nightingale;       Unless I look on Silvia in the day,       There is no day for me to look upon.\"                        --_Shakspeare_.      It was already past the middle of November when Captain Raymond received  his injuries, so that the six weeks or more of enforced inaction would  carry him into the month of January.    He had hoped to spend Christmas with his children, but that was now  clearly impossible, as he sadly owned to himself, for he was a loving  father and felt the disappointment keenly on both his own account and  theirs.
