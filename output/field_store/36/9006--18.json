IX.--WINES.    _To make strong Mead_:--Take of spring-water what quantity you please,  and make it more than blood-warm, and dissolve honey in it till 'tis  strong enough to bear an egg, the breadth of a shilling; then boil  it gently near an hour, taking off the scum as it rises; then put to  about nine or ten gallons, seven or eight large blades of mace, three  nutmegs quarter'd, twenty cloves, three or four sticks of cinamon, two  or three roots of ginger, and a quarter of an ounce of Jamaica pepper;  put these spices into the kettle to the honey and water, a whole  lemon, with a sprig of sweet-briar, and a sprig of rosemary; tie the  briar and rosemary together, and when they have boiled a little while,  take them out and throw them away; but let your liquor stand on the  spice in a clean earthen pot till the next day; then strain it into a  vessel that is fit for it; put the spice in a bag, and hang it in the  vessel, stop it, and at three months draw it into bottles. Be sure  that 'tis fine when 'tis bottled; after 'tis bottled six weeks 'tis  fit to drink.    _To make small White Mead_:--Take three gallons of spring-water and  make it hot, and dissolve in it three quarts of honey and a pound of  loaf sugar; and let it boil about half an hour, and scum it as long  as any rises, then pour it out into a tub, and squeeze in the juice of  four lemons; put in the rinds of but two; twenty cloves, two races of  ginger, a top of sweet-briar, and a top of rosemary. Let it stand in  a tub till 'tis but blood warm; then make a brown toast and spread it  with two or three spoonfuls of ale-yeast, put it into a vessel fit for  it; let it stand four or five days, then bottle it out.    _To make Frontiniac Wine_:--Take six gallons of water and twelve  pounds of white sugar, and six pounds of raisins of the sun cut small;  boil these together an hour; then take of the flowers of elder, when  they are falling and will shake off, the quantity of half a peck;  put them in the liquor when 'tis almost cold, the next day put in six  spoonfuls of syrup of lemons, and four spoonfuls of ale-yeast, and  two days after put it in a vessel that is fit for it, and when it has  stood two months bottle it off.    _To make English Champagne, or the fine Currant Wine_:--Take to three  gallons of water nine pounds of Lisbon sugar; boil the water and sugar  half an hour, scum it clean, then have one gallon of currants pick'd,  but not bruised, pour the liquor boiling-hot over them, and when cold,  work it with half a pint of balm two days; then pour it through a  flannel or sieve, then put it into a barrel fit for it with half an  ounce of ising-glass well bruised; when it has done working, stop  it close for a month, then bottle it, and in every bottle put a very  small lump of double-refin'd sugar. This is excellent wine, and has a  beautiful colour.    _To make Saragossa Wine, or English Sack_:--To every quart of water,  put a sprig of rue, and to every gallon a handful of fennel-roots,  boil these half an hour, then strain it out, and to every gallon of  this liquor put three pounds of honey; boil it two hours, and scum  it well, and when 'tis cold pour it off and turn it into a vessel, or  such cask that is fit for it; keep it a year in the vessel, and then  bottle it; 'tis a very good sack.    _Mountain Wine_:--Pick out the big stalks of your Malaga raisins,  then chop them very small, five gallons to every gallon of cold  spring-water, let them steep a fortnight or more, squeeze out the  liquor and barrel it in a vessel fit for it; first fume the vessel  with brimstone; don't stop it up till the hissing is over.    _To make Quince Wine_;--Take your quinces when they are thorough ripe,  wipe off the fur very clean; then take out the cores and bruise them  as you do apples for cyder, and press them, and to every gallon of  juice put two pounds and a half of fine sugar, stir it together till  'tis dissolved; then put it in your cask, and when it has done working  stop it close; let it stand till March before you bottle it. You may  keep it two or three years, it will be better.    _To make Plumb Wine_:--Take twenty pounds of Malaga raisins, pick,  rub, and shred them, and put them into a tub; then take four gallons  of fair water and boil it an hour, and let it stand till 'tis  blood-warm; then put it to your raisins; let it stand nine or ten  days, stirring it once or twice a day, strain out your liquor, and mix  with it two quarts of damson juice, put it in a vessel, and when it  has done working, stop it close; at four or five months bottle it.    _To make Birch Wine_:--In March bore a hole in a tree, and put in a  faucet, and it will run two or three days together without hurting the  tree; then put in a pin to stop it, and the next year you may draw as  much from the same hole; put to every gallon of the liquor a quart of  good honey, and stir it well together, boil it an hour, scum it well,  and put in a few cloves, and a piece of lemon-peel; when 'tis almost  cold, put to it so much ale-yeast as will make it work like new ale,  and when the yeast begins to settle, put it in a runlet that will  just hold it: so let it stand six weeks or longer if you please; then  bottle it, and in a month you may drink it. It will keep a year or  two. You may make it with sugar, two pounds to a gallon, or something  more, if you keep it long. This is admirably wholesome as well as  pleasant, an opener of obstructions, good against the phthisick, and  good against the spleen and scurvy, a remedy for the stone, it will  abate heat in a fever or thrush, and has been given with good success.    _To make Sage Wine_:--Boil twenty-six quarts of spring-water a quarter  of an hour, and when 'tis blood-warm, put twenty-five pounds of Malaga  raisins pick'd, rubb'd and shred into it, with almost half a bushel of  red sage shred, and a porringer of ale-yeast; stir all well together,  and let it stand m a tub cover'd warm six or seven days, stirring it  once a day; then strain it out, and put it in a runlet. Let it work  three or four days, stop it up; when it has stood six or seven days  put in a quart or two of Malaga sack, and when 'tis fine bottle it.    _Sage Wine another way_:--Take thirty pounds of Malaga raisins pick'd  clean, and shred small, and one bushel of green sage shred small, then  boil five gallons of water, let the water stand till 'tis luke-warm;  then put it in a tub to your sage and raisins; let it stand five or  six days, stirring it twice or thrice a day; then strain and press the  liquor from the ingredients, put it in a cask, and let it stand six  months: then draw it clean off into another vessel; bottle it in two  days; in a month or six weeks it will be fit to drink, but best when  'tis a year old.    _To make Ebulum_:--To a hogshead of strong ale, take a heap'd bushel  of elder-berries, and half a pound of juniper-berries beaten; put in  all the berries when you put in the hops, and let them boil together  till the berries brake in pieces, then work it up as you do ale; when  it has done working, add to it half a pound of ginger, half an ounce  of cloves, as much mace, an ounce of nutmegs, and as much cinamon  grosly beaten, half a pound of citron, as much eringo-root, and  likewise of candied orange-peel; let the sweetmeats be cut in pieces  very thin, and put with the spice into a bag and hang it in the vessel  when you stop it up. So let it stand till 'tis fine, then bottle it up  and drink it with lumps of double-refined sugar in the glass.    _To make Cock Ale_:--Take ten gallons of ale, and a large cock, the  older the better, parboil the cock, flea him, and stamp him in a stone  mortar till his bones are broken, (you must craw and gut him when you  flea him) put the cock into two quarts of sack, and put to it three  pounds of raisins of the sun stoned, some blades of mace, and a few  cloves; put all these into a canvas bag, and a little before you find  the ale has done working, put the ale and bag together into a vessel;  in a week or nine days' time bottle it up, fill the bottles but just  above the necks, and leave the same time to ripen as other ale.    _To make it Elder Ale_:--Take ten bushels of malt to a hogshead, then  put two bushels of elder-berries pickt from the stalks into a pot or  earthen pan, and set it in a pot of boiling water till the berries  swell, then strain it out and put the juice into the guile-fat, and  beat it often in, and so order it as the common way of brewing.    _To clear Wine_:--Take half a pound of hartshorn, and dissolve it in  cyder, if it be for cyder, or Rhenish-wine for any liquor: this is  enough for a hogshead.    _To fine Wine the Lisbon way_:--To every twenty gallons of wine take  the whites of ten eggs, and a small handful of salt, beat it together  to a froth, and mix it well with a quart or more of the wine, then  pour it in the vessel, and in a few days it will be fine.          COOKERY BOOKS.    PART III.      In 1747 appeared a thin folio volume, of which I will transcribe the  title: \"The Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy, which far Exceeds  Every Thing of the Kind "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#16)"],[1," the saddle. A few pages  from my wife's \"Journal\" of September fifteenth describes our camp at  Lu-ho-we and our life on the road to Ta-li Fu.        We are sitting on the porch of an old, old temple. It is on a hilltop      in a forest grove with the gray-walled town lying at our feet. The sun      is flooding the flower-filled courtyard and throwing bars of golden      light through the twisted branches of a bent old pine, over the stone      well, and into the dim recesses behind the altar where a benevolent      idol grins down upon us.        We have been in the saddle for eight hours and it is enchanting to rest      in this peaceful, aged temple. Outside children are shouting and      laughing but all is quiet here save for the drip of water in the well,      and the chatter of a magpie on the pine tree. Today we made the stage      in one long march and now we can rest and browse among our books or      wander with a gun along the cool, tree-shaded paths.        The sun is hot at midday, although the mornings and evenings are cold,      and tonight we shall build a fragrant fire of yellow pine, and talk for      an hour before we go to sleep upon the porch where we can see the moon      come up and the stars shining so low that they seem like tiny lanterns      in the sky.        It is seven days since we left Yün-nan Fu and each night we have come      to temples such as this. There is an inexpressible charm about them,      lying asleep, as it were, among the trees of their courtyards, with      stately, pillared porches, and picturesque gables upturned to the sky.      They seem so very, very old and filled with such great calm and peace.        Sometimes they stand in the midst of a populous town and we ride      through long streets between dirty houses, swarming with ragged women,      filthy men, and screaming children; suddenly we come to the dilapidated      entrance of our temple, pass through a courtyard, close the huge gates      and are in another world.        We leave early every morning and the boys are up long before dawn. As      we sleepily open our eyes we see their dark figures silhouetted against      the brilliant camp fire, hear the yawns of the _mafus_ and the      contented crunching of the mules as they chew their beans.        Wu appears with a lantern and calls out the hour and before we have      fully dressed the odor of coffee has found its way to the remotest      corner of the temple, and a breakfast of pancakes, eggs, and oatmeal is      awaiting on the folding table spread with a clean white cloth. While we      are eating, the beds are packed, and the loads retied, accompanied by a      running fire of exhortations to the _mafus_ who cause us endless      trouble.        They are a hard lot, these _mafus_. Force seems to be the only thing      they understand and kindness produces no results. If the march is long      and we stop for tiffin it is well-nigh impossible to get them started      within three hours without the aid of threats. Once after a long halt      when all seemed ready, we rode ahead only to wait by the roadside for      hours before the caravan arrived. As soon as we were out of sight they      had begun to shoe their mules and that night we did not make our stage      until long after dark.        In the morning when we see the first loads actually on the horses we      ride off at the head of the caravan followed by a straggling line of      mules and horses picking their way over the jagged stones of the road.      It is delightful in the early morning for the air is fresh and brisk      like that of October at home, but later in the day when the sun is      higher it is uncomfortably hot, and we are glad to find a bit of shade      where we can rest until the caravan arrives.        The roads are execrable. The Chinese have a proverb which says: \"A road      is good for ten years and bad for ten thousand,\" and this applies most      excellently to those of Yün-nan. The main caravan highways are paved      with huge stones to make them passable during the rainy season, but      after a few years' wear the blocks become broken and irregular, the      earth is washed from between them and they are upturned at impossible      angles. The result is a chaotic mass which by no stretch of imagination      can be called a road. Where the stones are still in place they have      been worn to such glasslike smoothness by the thousands of passing      mules that it is well-nigh impossible to walk upon them. As a result a      caravan avoids the paving whenever it can find a path and sometimes      dozens of deeply-cut trails wind over the hills beside the road.        We are seldom on level ground, for ten per cent of the entire province      is mountainous and we soon lost count of the ranges which we crossed.      It is slow, hard work, toiling up the steep mountain-sides, but once on      the ridges where the country is spread out below us like a great, green      relief map, there is a wonderful exhilaration, and we climb higher with      a joyous sense of freedom.        Yün-nan means \"south of the cloud\" and every morning the peaks about us      are shrouded in fog. Sometimes the veil-like mists still float about      the mountain tops when we climb into them, and we are suddenly      enveloped in a wet gray blanket which sends us shivering into the coats      tied to our saddles.    For centuries this road has been one of the main trade arteries through the  province, and with the total lack of conservation ideas so characteristic  of the Chinese, every available bit of natural forest has been cut away. As  a result the mountains are desert wastes of sandstone alternating with  grass-covered hills sometimes clothed with groves of pines or spruces.  These trees have all been planted, and ere they have reached a height of  fifteen or twenty feet will yield to the insistent demand for wood which is  ever present with the Chinese.    The ignorance of the need of forest conservation is an illuminating  commentary on Chinese education. Mr. William Hanna, a missionary of Ta-li  Fu, told us that one day he was riding over this same road with a Chinese  gentleman, a deep scholar, who was considered one of the best educated men  of the province. Pointing to the barren hills washed clean of soil and  deeply worn by countless floods, Mr. Hanna remarked that all this could  have been prevented, and that instead of a rocky waste there might have  been a fertile hillside, had the trees been left to grow.    The Chinese scholar listened in amazement to facts which every western  schoolboy has learned ere he is twelve years old, but of which he was  ignorant because they are not a part of Confucius' teachings. To study  modern science is considered a waste of time by the orthodox Chinese for  \"everything good must be old,\" and all his life he delves into the past  utterly neglectful of the present.    Every valley along the road was green with rice fields and this, together  with the deforestation of the mountains, is responsible for the almost  total lack of animal life. Night after night we set traps about our temple  camps only to find them untouched in the morning. There were no mammals  with the exception of a few red-bellied squirrels (_Callosciurus  erythraeus_ sub sp.) and now and then a tree shrew (_Tupaia belangeri  chinensis_).      The latter is an interesting species. Although it is an Insectivore, and a  relative of the tiny shrews which live in holes and under logs, it has  squirrel-like habits and in appearance is like a squirrel to which it is  totally unrelated. Instead of the thinly haired mouselike tails of the  ordinary shrews the tupaias have developed long bushy tails and in fact  look and act so much like squirrels that it is difficult to convince the  white residents of Yün-nan, who are accustomed to see them run about the  hedges and walls of their courtyards that the two are quite unrelated.    The tree shrews are found only in Asia and are one of the most remarkable  instances of a superficial resemblance between unrelated animals with  similar habits. A study of their anatomy has revealed the fact that they  represent a distinct group which is connected with the monkeys (lemurs).    Although birds were fairly abundant the species were not varied. We were  about a month too early for the ducks and geese, which during the winter  swarm into Yün-nan from the north, and without a dog, pheasants are  difficult to get. In fact we were greatly disappointed in the game birds,  for we had expected good pheasant shooting even along the road and  virtually none were to be found.    The main caravan roads of Yün-nan held little of interest for us as  naturalists, but as students of native customs they were fascinating, for  the life of the province passed before us in panoramic completeness.  Chinese villages wherever we have seen them are marvels of utter and  abandoned filth and although those of Yün-nan are no exception to the rule,  they are considerably better than the coast cities.    Pigs, chickens, horses and cows live in happy communion with the human  inmates of the houses, the pigs especially being treated as we favor dogs  at home. On the door steps children play with the swine, patting and  pounding them, and one of my friends said that he had actually seen a  mother bring her baby to be nursed by a sow with her family of piglets.    The natives were pleasant and friendly and seemed to be industrious.  Wherever the deforestation had left sufficient soil on the lower hillsides  patches of corn took the place of the former poppy fields for opium. In  1906, the Empress Dowager issued an edict prohibiting the growing of opium,  and gave guarantees to the British that it would be entirely stamped out  during the next ten years. Strangely enough these promises have been  faithfully kept, and in Yün-nan the hillsides, which were once white "]]]
