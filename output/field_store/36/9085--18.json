Their long voyage was made with singular  success, and the soldierly conduct of the men, most of whom were without  previous experience in the military service, deserves unmeasured praise.    The total casualties in killed and wounded in the Army during the war  with Spain were: Officers killed, 23; enlisted men killed, 257; total,  280; officers wounded, 113; enlisted men wounded, 1,464; total, 1,577.  Of the Navy: Killed, 17; wounded, 67; died as result of wounds, 1;  invalided from service, 6; total, 91.    It will be observed that while our Navy was engaged in two great battles  and in numerous perilous undertakings in blockade and bombardment, and  more than 50,000 of our troops were transported to distant lands and  were engaged in assault and siege and battle and many skirmishes in  unfamiliar territory, we lost in both arms of the service a total of  1,668 killed and wounded; and in the entire campaign by land and sea we  did not lose a gun or a flag or a transport or a ship, and, with the  exception of the crew of the _Merrimac_, not a soldier or sailor  was taken prisoner.    On August 7, forty-six days from the date of the landing of General  Shafter's army in Cuba and twenty-one days from the surrender of  Santiago, the United States troops commenced embarkation for home, and  our entire force was returned to the United States as early as August  24. They were absent from the United States only two months.    It is fitting that I should bear testimony to the patriotism and  devotion of that large portion of our Army which, although eager to be  ordered to the post of greatest exposure, fortunately was not required  outside of the United States. They did their whole duty, and, like their  comrades at the front, have earned the gratitude of the nation. In like  manner, the officers and men of the Army and of the Navy who remained  in their departments and stations faithfully performing most important  duties connected with the war, and whose requests for assignment in the  field and at sea I was compelled to refuse because their services were  indispensable here, are entitled to the highest commendation. It is my  regret that there seems to be no provision for their suitable  recognition.    In this connection it is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of  cordial appreciation the timely and useful work of the American National  Red Cross, both in relief measures preparatory to the campaigns, in  sanitary assistance at several of the camps of assemblage, and later,  under the able and experienced leadership of the president of the  society, Miss Clara Barton, on the fields of battle and in the hospitals  at the front in Cuba. Working in conjunction with the governmental  authorities and under their sanction and approval, and with the  enthusiastic cooperation of many patriotic women and societies in the  various States, the Red Cross has fully maintained its already high  reputation for intense earnestness and ability to exercise the noble  purposes of its international organization, thus justifying the  confidence and support which it has received at the hands of the  American people. To the members and officers of this society and all who  aided them in their philanthropic work the sincere and lasting gratitude  of the soldiers and the public is due and is freely accorded.    In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to  the Divine Master for His watchful care over us and His safe guidance,  for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and offers humble  prayer for the continuance of His favor.    The annihilation of Admiral Cervera's fleet, followed by the  capitulation of Santiago, having brought to the Spanish Government  a realizing sense of the hopelessness of continuing a struggle now  become wholly unequal, it made overtures of peace through the French  ambassador, who, with the assent of his Government, had acted as the  friendly representative of Spanish interests during the war. On the  26th of July M. Cambon presented a communication signed by the Duke of  Almodovar, the Spanish minister of state, inviting the United States to  state the terms upon which it would be willing to make peace. On the  30th of July, by a communication addressed to the Duke of Almodovar  and handed to M. Cambon, the terms of this Government were announced  substantially as in the protocol afterwards signed. On the 10th of  August the Spanish reply, dated August 7, was handed by M. Cambon to the  Secretary of State. It accepted unconditionally the terms imposed as to  Cuba, Puerto Rico, and an island of the Ladrones group, but appeared to  seek to introduce inadmissible reservations in regard to our demand as  to the Philippine Islands. Conceiving that discussion on this point  could neither be practical nor profitable, I directed that in order  to avoid misunderstanding the matter should be forthwith closed by  proposing the embodiment in a formal protocol of the terms upon which  the negotiations for peace were to be undertaken. The vague and  inexplicit suggestions of the Spanish note could not be accepted, the  only reply being to present as a virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol  embodying the precise terms tendered to Spain in our note of July 30,  with added stipulations of detail as to the appointment of commissioners  to arrange for the evacuation of the Spanish Antilles. On August 12  M. Cambon announced his receipt of full powers to sign the protocol  so submitted. Accordingly, on the afternoon of August 12, M. Cambon,  as the plenipotentiary of Spain, and the Secretary of State, as the  plenipotentiary of the United States, signed a protocol providing--      ARTICLE I. Spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and title    to Cuba.      ART. II. Spain will cede to the United States the island of Puerto Rico    and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and    also an island in the Ladrones to be selected by the United States.      ART. III. The United States will occupy and hold the city, bay, and    harbor of Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace which shall    determine the control, disposition, and government of the Philippines.      The fourth article provided for the appointment of joint commissions on  the part of the United States and Spain, to meet in Havana and San Juan,  respectively, for the purpose of arranging and carrying out the details  of the stipulated evacuation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other Spanish  islands in the West Indies.    The fifth article provided for the appointment of not more than five  commissioners on each side, to meet at Paris not later than October 1  and to proceed to the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty of peace,  subject to ratification according to the respective constitutional forms  of the two countries.    The sixth and last article provided that upon the signature of the  protocol hostilities between the two countries should be suspended and  that notice to that effect should be given as soon as possible by each  Government to the commanders of its military and naval forces.    Immediately upon the conclusion of the protocol I issued a proclamation,  of August 12,[22] suspending hostilities on the part of the United  States. The necessary orders to that end were at once given by  telegraph. The blockade of the ports of Cuba and San Juan de Puerto Rico  was in like manner raised. On the 18th of August the muster out of  100,000 volunteers, or as near that number as was found to be  practicable, was ordered.    On the 1st of December 101,165 officers and men had been mustered out  and discharged from the service, and 9,002 more will be mustered out  by the 10th of this month; also a corresponding number of general and  general staff officers have been honorably discharged the service.    The military commissions to superintend the evacuation of Cuba, Puerto  Rico, and the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed--for Cuba,  Major-General James F. Wade, Rear-Admiral William T. Sampson,  Major-General Matthew C. Butler; for Puerto Rico, Major-General John R.  Brooke, Rear-Admiral Winfield S. Schley, Brigadier-General William W.  Gordon--who soon afterwards met the Spanish commissioners at Havana and  San Juan, respectively. The Puerto Rican Joint Commission speedily  accomplished its task, and by the 18th of October the evacuation of the  island was completed. The United States flag was raised over the island  at noon on that day. The administration of its affairs has been  provisionally intrusted to a military governor until the Congress shall  otherwise provide. The Cuban Joint Commission has not yet terminated its  labors. Owing to the difficulties in the way of removing the large  numbers of Spanish troops still in Cuba, the evacuation can not be  completed before the 1st of January next.    Pursuant to the fifth article of the protocol, I appointed William R.  Day, lately Secretary of State; Cushman K. Davis, William P. Frye, and  George Gray, Senators of the United States, and Whitelaw Reid to be the  peace commissioners on the part of the United States. Proceeding in due  season to Paris, they there met on the 1st of October five commissioners  similarly appointed on the part of Spain. Their negotiations have made  hopeful progress, so that I trust soon to be able to lay a definitive  treaty of peace before the Senate, with a review of the steps leading  to its signature.    I do not discuss at this time the government or the future of the new  possessions which will come to us as the result of the war with Spain.  Such discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall  be ratified. In the meantime and until the Congress has legislated  otherwise it will be my duty to continue the military governments which  have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#16)"],[1,"and any danger  coming from the woods.  Before evening we had successfully passed the  rapids, and made our way some ten miles above them, where we anchored  for the night.  At this point I reckoned that we had come not less than  a hundred miles up the tributary from the main stream.    It was in the early forenoon of the next day that we made the great  departure.  Since dawn Professor Challenger had been acutely uneasy,  continually scanning each bank of the river.  Suddenly he gave an  exclamation of satisfaction and pointed to a single tree, which  projected at a peculiar angle over the side of the stream.    \"What do you make of that?\" he asked.    \"It is surely an Assai palm,\" said Summerlee.    \"Exactly.  It was an Assai palm which I took for my landmark.  The  secret opening is half a mile onwards upon the other side of the river.  There is no break in the trees.  That is the wonder and the mystery of  it.  There where you see light-green rushes instead of dark-green  undergrowth, there between the great cotton woods, that is my private  gate into the unknown.  Push through, and you will understand.\"    It was indeed a wonderful place.  Having reached the spot marked by a  line of light-green rushes, we poled out two canoes through them for  some hundreds of yards, and eventually emerged into a placid and  shallow stream, running clear and transparent over a sandy bottom.  It  may have been twenty yards across, and was banked in on each side by  most luxuriant vegetation.  No one who had not observed that for a  short distance reeds had taken the place of shrubs, could possibly have  guessed the existence of such a stream or dreamed of the fairyland  beyond.    For a fairyland it was--the most wonderful that the imagination of man  could conceive.  The thick vegetation met overhead, interlacing into a  natural pergola, and through this tunnel of verdure in a golden  twilight flowed the green, pellucid river, beautiful in itself, but  marvelous from the strange tints thrown by the vivid light from above  filtered and tempered in its fall.  Clear as crystal, motionless as a  sheet of glass, green as the edge of an iceberg, it stretched in front  of us under its leafy archway, every stroke of our paddles sending a  thousand ripples across its shining surface.  It was a fitting avenue  to a land of wonders.  All sign of the Indians had passed away, but  animal life was more frequent, and the tameness of the creatures showed  that they knew nothing of the hunter.  Fuzzy little black-velvet  monkeys, with snow-white teeth and gleaming, mocking eyes, chattered at  us as we passed.  With a dull, heavy splash an occasional cayman  plunged in from the bank.  Once a dark, clumsy tapir stared at us from  a gap in the bushes, and then lumbered away through the forest; once,  too, the yellow, sinuous form of a great puma whisked amid the  brushwood, and its green, baleful eyes glared hatred at us over its  tawny shoulder.  Bird life was abundant, especially the wading birds,  stork, heron, and ibis gathering in little groups, blue, scarlet, and  white, upon every log which jutted from the bank, while beneath us the  crystal water was alive with fish of every shape and color.    For three days we made our way up this tunnel of hazy green sunshine.  On the longer stretches one could hardly tell as one looked ahead where  the distant green water ended and the distant green archway began.  The  deep peace of this strange waterway was unbroken by any sign of man.    \"No Indian here.  Too much afraid.  Curupuri,\" said Gomez.    \"Curupuri is the spirit of the woods,\" Lord John explained.  \"It's a  name for any kind of devil.  The poor beggars think that there is  something fearsome in this direction, and therefore they avoid it.\"    On the third day it became evident that our journey in the canoes could  not last much longer, for the stream was rapidly growing more shallow.  Twice in as many hours we stuck upon the bottom.  Finally we pulled the  boats up among the brushwood and spent the night on the bank of the  river.  In the morning Lord John and I made our way for a couple of  miles through the forest, keeping parallel with the stream; but as it  grew ever shallower we returned and reported, what Professor Challenger  had already suspected, that we had reached the highest point to which  the canoes could be brought.  We drew them up, therefore, and concealed  them among the bushes, blazing a tree with our axes, so that we should  find them again.  Then we distributed the various burdens among  us--guns, ammunition, food, a tent, blankets, and the rest--and,  shouldering our packages, we set forth upon the more laborious stage of  our journey.    An unfortunate quarrel between our pepper-pots marked the outset of our  new stage.  Challenger had from the moment of joining us issued  directions to the whole party, much to the evident discontent of  Summerlee.  Now, upon his assigning some duty to his fellow-Professor  (it was only the carrying of an aneroid barometer), the matter suddenly  came to a head.    \"May I ask, sir,\" said Summerlee, with vicious calm, \"in what capacity  you take it upon yourself to issue these orders?\"    Challenger glared and bristled.    \"I do it, Professor Summerlee, as leader of this expedition.\"    \"I am compelled to tell you, sir, that I do not recognize you in that  capacity.\"    \"Indeed!\" Challenger bowed with unwieldy sarcasm.  \"Perhaps you would  define my exact position.\"    \"Yes, sir.  You are a man whose veracity is upon trial, and this  committee is here to try it.  You walk, sir, with your judges.\"    \"Dear me!\" said Challenger, seating himself on the side of one of the  canoes.  \"In that case you will, of course, go on your way, and I will  follow at my leisure.  If I am not the leader you cannot expect me to  lead.\"    Thank heaven that there were two sane men--Lord John Roxton and  myself--to prevent the petulance and folly of our learned Professors  from sending us back empty-handed to London.  Such arguing and pleading  and explaining before we could get them mollified!  Then at last  Summerlee, with his sneer and his pipe, would move forwards, and  Challenger would come rolling and grumbling after.  By some good  fortune we discovered about this time that both our savants had the  very poorest opinion of Dr. Illingworth of Edinburgh.  Thenceforward  that was our one safety, and every strained situation was relieved by  our introducing the name of the Scotch zoologist, when both our  Professors would form a temporary alliance and friendship in their  detestation and abuse of this common rival.    Advancing in single file along the bank of the stream, we soon found  that it narrowed down to a mere brook, and finally that it lost itself  in a great green morass of sponge-like mosses, into which we sank up to  our knees.  The place was horribly haunted by clouds of mosquitoes and  every form of flying pest, so we were glad to find solid ground again  and to make a circuit among the trees, which enabled us to outflank  this pestilent morass, which droned like an organ in the distance, so  loud was it with insect life.    On the second day after leaving our canoes we found that the whole  character of the country changed.  Our road was persistently upwards,  and as we ascended the woods became thinner and lost their tropical  luxuriance.  The huge trees of the alluvial Amazonian plain gave place  to the Phoenix and coco palms, growing in scattered clumps, with thick  brushwood between.  In the damper hollows the Mauritia palms threw out  their graceful drooping fronds.  We traveled entirely by compass, and  once or twice there were differences of opinion between Challenger and  the two Indians, when, to quote the Professor's indignant words, the  whole party agreed to \"trust the fallacious instincts of undeveloped  savages rather than the highest product of modern European culture.\"  That we were justified in doing so was shown upon the third day, when  Challenger admitted that he recognized several landmarks of his former  journey, and in one spot we actually came upon four fire-blackened  stones, which must have marked a camping-place.    The road still ascended, and we crossed a rock-studded slope which took  two days to traverse.  The vegetation had again changed, and only the  vegetable ivory tree remained, with a great profusion of wonderful  orchids, among which I learned to recognize the rare Nuttonia  Vexillaria and the glorious pink and scarlet blossoms of Cattleya and  odontoglossum.  Occasional brooks with pebbly bottoms and fern-draped  banks gurgled down the shallow gorges in the hill, and offered good  camping-grounds every evening on the banks of some rock-studded pool,  where swarms of little blue-backed fish, about the size and shape of  English trout, gave us a delicious supper.    On the ninth day after leaving the canoes, having done, as I reckon,  about a hundred and twenty miles, we began to emerge from the trees,  which had grown smaller until they were mere shrubs.  Their place was  taken by an immense wilderness of bamboo, which grew so thickly that we  could only penetrate it by cutting a pathway with the machetes and  billhooks of the Indians.  It took us a long day, traveling from seven  in the morning till eight at night, with only two breaks of one hour  each, to get through this obstacle.  Anything more monotonous and  wearying could not be imagined, for, even at the most open places, I  could not see more than ten or twelve yards, while usually my vision  was limited to the back of Lord John's cotton jacket in front of me,  and to the yellow wall within a foot of me on either side.  From above  came one thin knife-edge of sunshine, and fifteen feet over our heads  one saw the tops of the reeds swaying against the deep blue sky.  I do  not know what kind of creatures inhabit such a thicket, but several  times we heard the plunging of large,"]]]
