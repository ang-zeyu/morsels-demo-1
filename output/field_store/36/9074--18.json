Ay, I know the place: many a poor  fellow has gone up there straight, and come down feet foremost.\"    He then told them how he had looked up and seen Gerard's face at a  window that was like a slit in the wall.    \"Oh, Martin! how did he look?\"    \"What mean you? He looked like Gerard Eliassoen.\"    \"But was he pale?\"    \"A little.\"    \"Looked he anxious? Looked he like one doomed?\"    \"Nay, nay; as bright as a pewter pot.\"    \"You mock me. Stay! then that must have been at sight of you. He counts  on us. Oh, what shall we do? Martin, good friend, take this at once to  Rotterdam.\"    Martin held out his hand for the letter.    Peter had sat silent all this time, but pondering, and yet, contrary to  custom, keenly attentive to what was going on around him.    \"Put not your trust in princes,\" said he.    \"Alas! what else have we to trust in?\"    \"Knowledge.\"    \"Well-a-day, father! your learning will not serve us here.\"    \"How know you that? Wit has been too strong for iron bars ere to-day.    \"Ay, father; but nature is stronger than wit, and she is against us.  Think of the height! No ladder in Holland might reach him.\"    \"I need no ladder; what I need is a gold crown.\"    \"Nay, I have money, for that matter. I have nine angels. Gerard gave  them me to keep; but what do they avail? The burgomaster will not be  bribed to let Gerard free.\"    \"What do they avail? Give me but one crown, and the young man shall sup  with us this night.\"    Peter spoke so eagerly and confidently, that for a moment Margaret  felt hopeful; but she caught Martin's eye dwelling upon him with an  expression of benevolent contempt.    \"It passes the powers of man's invention,\" said she, with a deep sigh.    \"Invention!\" cried the old man. \"A fig for invention. What need we  invention at this time of day? Everything has been said that is to be  said, and done that ever will be done. I shall tell you how a Florentine  knight was shut up in a tower higher than Gerard's; yet did his faithful  squire stand at the tower foot and get him out, with no other engine  than that in your hand, Martin, and certain kickshaws I shall buy for a  crown.\"    Martin looked at his bow, and turned it round in his hand, and seemed to  interrogate it. But the examination left him as incredulous as before.    Then Peter told them his story, how the faithful squire got the knight  out of a high tower at Brescia. The manoeuvre, like most things that  are really scientific, was so simple, that now their wonder was they had  taken for impossible what was not even difficult.    The letter never went to Rotterdam. They trusted to Peter's learning and  their own dexterity.    It was nine o'clock on a clear moonlight night; Gerard, senior, was  still away; the rest of his little family had been some time abed.    A figure stood by the dwarf's bed. It was white, and the moonlight shone  on it.    With an unearthly noise, between a yell and a snarl, the gymnast rolled  off his bed and under it by a single unbroken movement. A soft voice  followed him in his retreat.    \"Why, Giles, are you afeard of me?\"    At this, Giles's head peeped cautiously up, and he saw it was only his  sister Kate.    She put her finger to her lips. \"Hush! lest the wicked Cornelis or the  wicked Sybrandt hear us.\" Giles's claws seized the side of the bed, and  he returned to his place by one undivided gymnastic.    Kate then revealed to Giles that she had heard Cornelis and Sybrandt  mention Gerard's name; and being herself in great anxiety at his not  coming home all day, had listened at their door, and had made a fearful  discovery. Gerard was in prison, in the haunted tower of the Stadthouse.  He was there, it seemed, by their father's authority. But here must be  some treachery; for how could their father have ordered this cruel act?  He was at Rotterdam. She ended by entreating Giles to bear her company  to the foot of the haunted tower, to say a word of comfort to poor  Gerard, and let him know their father was absent, and would be sure to  release him on his return.    \"Dear Giles, I would go alone, but I am afeard of the spirits that men  say do haunt the tower; but with you I shall not be afeard.\"    \"Nor I with you,\" said Giles. \"I don't believe there are any spirits in  Tergou. I never saw one. This last was the likest one ever I saw; and it  was but you, Kate, after all.\"    In less than half an hour Giles and Kate opened the housedoor cautiously  and issued forth. She made him carry a lantern, though the night was  bright. \"The lantern gives me more courage against the evil spirits,\"  said she.    The first day of imprisonment is very trying, especially if to the  horror of captivity is added the horror of utter solitude. I observe  that in our own day a great many persons commit suicide during the first  twenty-four hours of the solitary cell. This is doubtless why our Jairi  abstain so carefully from the impertinence of watching their little  experiment upon the human soul at that particular stage of it.    As the sun declined, Gerard's heart too sank and sank; with the waning  light even the embers of hope went out. He was faint, too, with hunger;  for he was afraid to eat the food Ghysbrecht had brought him; and hunger  alone cows men. He sat upon the chest, his arms and his head drooping  before him, a picture of despondency. Suddenly something struck the wall  beyond him very sharply, and then rattled on the floor at his feet. It  was an arrow; he saw the white feather. A chill ran through him--they  meant then to assassinate him from the outside. He crouched. No more  missiles came. He crawled on all fours, and took up the arrow; there was  no head to it. He uttered a cry of hope: had a friendly hand shot it? He  took it up, and felt it all over: he found a soft substance attached  to it. Then one of his eccentricities was of grand use to him. His  tinder-box enabled him to strike a light: it showed him two things that  made his heart bound with delight, none the less thrilling for being  somewhat vague. Attached to the arrow was a skein of silk, and on the  arrow itself were words written.    How his eyes devoured them, his heart panting the while!    Well beloved, make fast the silk to thy knife and lower to us: but hold  thine end fast: then count an hundred and draw up.    Gerard seized the oak chest, and with almost superhuman energy dragged  it to the window: a moment ago he could not have moved it. Standing on  the chest and looking down, he saw figures at the tower foot. They were  so indistinct, they looked like one huge form. He waved his bonnet to  them with trembling hand: then he undid the silk rapidly but carefully,  and made one end fast to his knife and lowered it till it ceased to  draw. Then he counted a hundred. Then pulled the silk carefully up: it  came up a little heavier. At last he came to a large knot, and by that  knot a stout whipcord was attached to the silk. What could this mean?  While he was puzzling himself Margaret's voice came up to him, low but  clear. \"Draw up, Gerard, till you see liberty.\" At the word Gerard drew  the whipcord line up, and drew and drew till he came to another knot,  and found a cord of some thickness take the place of the whipcord. He  had no sooner begun to draw this up, than he found that he had now a  heavy weight to deal with. Then the truth suddenly flashed on him, and  he went to work and pulled and pulled till the perspiration rolled down  him: the weight got heavier and heavier, and at last he was well-nigh  exhausted: looking down, he saw in the moonlight a sight that revived  him: it was as it were a great snake coming up to him out of the deep  shadow cast by the tower. He gave a shout of joy, and a score more wild  pulls, and lo! a stout new rope touched his hand: he hauled and hauled,  and dragged the end into his prison, and instantly passed it through  both handles of the chest in succession, and knotted it firmly; then sat  for a moment to recover his breath and collect his courage. The  first thing was to make sure that the chest was sound, and capable of  resisting his weight poised in mid-air. He jumped with all his force  upon it. At the third jump the whole side burst open, and out scuttled  the contents, a host of parchments.    After the first start and misgiving this gave him, Gerard comprehended  that the chest had not burst, but opened: he had doubtless jumped upon  some secret spring. Still it shook in some degree his confidence in the  chest's powers of resistance; so he gave it an ally: he took the iron  bar and fastened it with the small rope across the large rope, and  across the window. He now mounted the chest, and from the chest put his  foot through the window, and sat half in and half out, with one hand on  that part of the rope which was inside. In the silent night he heard his  own heart beat.    The free air breathed on his face, and gave him the courage to risk what  we must all lose one day--for liberty. Many dangers awaited him, but the  greatest was the first getting on to the rope outside. Gerard reflected.  Finally, he put himself in the attitude of a swimmer, his body to the  waist being in the prison, his legs outside. Then holding the inside  rope with both hands, he felt anxiously with his feet for the outside  rope, and when he had got it, he worked it in between the palms of his  feet, and kept it there tight: then he uttered a short prayer, and, all  the calmer for it, put his left hand on the sill and gradually wriggled  out. Then he seized the iron bar, and for one fearful moment hung  outside from it by his right hand, while his left hand felt for the rope  down at his knees; it was too tight against the wall for his fingers to  get round it higher up. The moment he had fairly grasped it, he left the  bar, and swiftly seized the rope with the right hand too; but in this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13665"],[0,"War in the Garden of Eden (#16)"],[1,"with whom we could talk and laugh in Occidental fashion.    By far the best-informed and cleverest Arab was Pere Anastase. He was a  Catholic, and under the supervision of the Political Department edited the  local Arab paper. All his life he had worked building up a  library--gathering rare books throughout Syria and Mesopotamia. He was  himself an author of no small reputation. Just before the British took  Baghdad the Germans pillaged his collection, sending the more valuable  books to Constantinople and Berlin, and turning the rest over to the  populace. The soldiers made great bonfires of many--others found their way  to the bazaars, where he was later able to repurchase some of them. When  talking of the sacking of his house, Pere Anastase would work himself into  a white heat of fury and his eyes would flash as he bitterly cursed the  vandals who had destroyed his treasures.    It was in Baghdad that I first ran into Major E.B. Soane, whose _Through  Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in Disguise_ is a classic. Soane was born in  southern France, his mother French and his father English. The latter  walked across the United States from ocean to ocean in the early forties,  so Soane came by his roving, adventurous spirit naturally. When still but  little more than a boy he went out to work in the Anglo-Persian Bank, and  immediately interested himself in the language and literature of the  country. Some of his holidays he spent in the British Museum translating  and cataloguing Persian manuscripts. Becoming interested in the Kurds, he  spent a number of years among them, learning their languages and customs  and joining in their raids.    As soon as we got a foothold in the Kurdish Hills, Soane was sent up to  administer the captured territory. His headquarters were at Khanikin,  twenty-five miles from Kizil Robat and but a short distance from the  Persian frontier. One morning during the time that I was stationed in that  district I motored over to see him. It was a glorious day. The cloud  effects were most beautiful, towering in billows of white above the snow  peaks, against a background of deepest blue. The road wound in and out  among the barren foot-hills until suddenly as I topped a rise I saw right  below a great clump of palm-trees, with houses showing through here and  there--the whole divided by a lovely river bestridden by an old seven-arch  bridge. I picked my way through the narrow streets, scattering ragged  Kurds right and left; past part of the covered bazaar, until I came to a  house with a large courtyard, thronged with a motley array of Kurdish  irregulars, armed with every sort of weapon. It was there that Soane  administered his stern but practical justice, for he thoroughly understood  how to handle these men.    The district had suffered fearfully, for it had been occupied in turn by  Turk and Russian, and then Turk again, before we took it over, and the  unfortunate natives had been pillaged and robbed mercilessly. Thousands  starved to death. When I was at Deli Abbas ghastly bands of ragged  skeletons would come through to us begging food and work. Soane turned a  large khan on the outskirts of the town into a poorhouse, and here he  lodged the starving women and children that drifted in from all over  Kurdistan. It was a fearful assemblage of scarecrows. As they got better  he selected women from among them to whom he turned over the  administration of the khan. They divided the unfortunates in gangs, and  supervised the issue of dates on which they were fed. Such as were  physically able were employed in cleaning the town. The Kurds are a fine,  self-respecting race and it was easy to understand Soane's enthusiasm for  them.           *       *       *       *       *    In Baghdad you lived either in the cellars or on the housetops. The former  were called serdabs. A large chimney, cowled to face the prevailing wind,  served for ventilation, and on the hottest days one was cool and  comfortable. We slept on the roofs, and often dined there, too. Since the  town was the General Headquarters of the Expeditionary Force, one was  always sure to meet many friends. A comfortable and well-run officers'  club was installed, as well as warrant officers' and enlisted men's clubs.    Occasionally race meetings were planned and the various divisions would  send representatives. Frank Wooton, the well-known jockey, was a  despatch-rider, and usually succeeded in getting leave enough to allow him  to ride some general's horses. An Arab race formed part of the programme.  Once a wild tribesman who had secured a handsome lead almost lost the  race by taking off his cloak and waving it round his head as he gave  ear-piercing shouts of triumph. The Arab riding second was less emotional  and attended better to the business in hand, but his horse was not quite  good enough to make the difference.    The scene at the race-course was a gay one. The color was chiefly  contributed by the Jewesses who wore their hooded silk cloaks of lively  hue--green or pink or yellow. The only crowd that I saw to vie with it was  one which watched the prisoners taken at Ramadie march through the town.  Turkish propaganda, circulated in the bazaars, gave out that instead of  taking the prisoners we claimed, we had in reality suffered a defeat, and  it was decided that the sight of the captive Turks would have a salutary  effect upon the townsmen. Looking down from a housetop the red fezzes and  the gay-colored abas made the crowd look like a vast field of poppies.    When I was at Samarra an amusing incident took place in connection with a  number of officers' wives who were captured at Ramadie. The army commander  didn't wish to ship them off to India and Burma with their husbands, so he  sent them up to Samarra with instructions that they be returned across  the lines to the Turks. After many aeroplane messages were exchanged it  was agreed that we should leave them at a designated hill and that the  Turks would later come for them. Meanwhile we had arranged quarters for  them, trying to do everything in a manner that would be in harmony with  the Turkish convenances. When the wives were escorted forth to be turned  back to their countrymen, they were all weeping bitterly. Whether it was  that the Turk in his casual manner decided that one day was as good as  another, or whether he felt that he had no particular use for these  particular women, we never knew, but at all events twenty-four hours later  one of our patrols came upon the prisoners still forlornly waiting. We  shipped them back to Baghdad.    Occasionally I would go to one of the Arab theatres. The plays were  generally burlesques, for the Arab has a keen sense of humor and greatly  appreciates a joke. Most of the puns were too involved for me to follow,  but there was always a certain amount of slap-stick comedy that could be  readily understood. Then there was dancing--as a whole monotonous and  mediocre; but there was one old man who was a remarkable performer, and  would have been appreciated on any stage in the world. The topical songs  invariably amused me--they were so universal in spirit. The chorus of one  which was a great hit ran: \"Haido, haido, rahweni passak!\" \"I say, I say,  show me your pass.\" There had been much trouble with spies and every one  was required to provide himself with a certificate of good conduct and to  show it on demand. It was to this that the song referred.    Captain C.G. Lloyd was my companion on many rambles among the natives. He  had been stationed in Burma and India for many years, and was a good  Persian scholar. Like every one who has knocked about to any extent among  native peoples, his career had not been lacking in incident. I remember on  one occasion asking him why it was that he never joined me in a cup of  coffee when we stopped at a coffee-house. He replied that he had always  been wary of coffee since a man with him was poisoned by a cup which was  intended for him.    I always looked forward to a trip to Baghdad, for it gave me a chance to  mingle in a totally different life from that which daily surrounded me,  and temporarily, at least, forget about the war in which the world was  plunged. Still, the morning set to leave invariably found me equally glad  to shove off once more into the great expanses of the desert.          VII    THE ATTACK ON THE PERSIAN FRONT      When I reached headquarters after the attack on the Euphrates front, I was  expecting to hear that my transfer to France had gone through and receive  orders to proceed thither immediately. It had always been my intention to  try to join the American army once it began to take a real part in the  war, and for some time past I had been casting about in my mind for the  best method to carry out my plans. When affairs looked so very black for  the Allied forces in March and April, 1918, I decided that France was the  place where every one, who could by any possibility manage it, should be.  General Gillman, the chief of staff, had on more than one occasion shown  himself a good friend, and I determined to once more task his kindness. He  said that he thought he could arrange for my transfer to France, and that  once there I could work out the best way of getting into the American  army.    Everything went well, and I was daily expecting my orders, when Major  Thompson, who commanded the brigade of armored cars, sent for me and told  me that an advance was being planned on the Kurdish front. Only two  batteries were to be taken--the Eighth and the Thirteenth--but he said  that he would like to have me go along in command of the supply-train. Of  course I jumped at the chance, as the attack promised to be most  interesting.    We were told to be ready to move on an hour's notice. For several days the  weather held us back. The rain, helped out by the melting snow from the  mountains, caused the rivers to rise in flood. The Tigris rose"]]]
