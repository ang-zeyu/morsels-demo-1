Into this cart,  which was drawn by the celebrated rat-tail hunter, they were pitching  divers packages for town delivery, and a couple of light porters nearly  upset the Yorkshireman, as they bustled out with their loads. The  warehouse itself gave evident proof of great antiquity. It was not  one of your fine, light, lofty, mahogany-countered, banker-like  establishments of modern times, where the stock-in-trade often consists  of books and empty canisters, but a large, roomy, gloomy, dirty,  dingy sort of cellar above ground, full of hogsheads, casks, flasks,  sugar-loaves, jars, bags, bottles, and boxes.    The floor was half an inch thick, at least, with dirt, and was sprinkled  with rice, currants, and raisins, as though they had been scattered for  the purpose of growing. A small corner seemed to have been cut off, like  the fold of a Leicestershire grazing-ground, and made into an office in  the centre of which was a square or two of glass that commanded a view  of the whole warehouse. \"Is Mr. Jorrocks in?\" inquired the Yorkshireman  of a porter, who was busy digging currants with a wooden spade. \"Yes,  sir, you'll find him in the counting-house,\" was the answer; but on  looking in, though his hat and gloves were there, no Jorrocks was  visible. At the farther end of the warehouse a man in his shirt-sleeves,  with a white apron round his waist and a brown paper cap on his head,  was seen under a very melancholy-looking skylight, holding his head over  something, as if his nose were bleeding. The Yorkshireman groped his way  up to him, and asking if Mr. Jorrocks was in, found he was addressing  the grocer himself. He had been leaning over a large trayful of little  white cups--with teapots to match--trying the strength, flavour, and  virtue of a large purchase of tea, and the beverage was all smoking  before him. \"My vig,\" exclaimed he, holding out his hand, \"who'd have  thought of seeing you in the city, this is something unkimmon! However,  you're werry welcome in St. Botolph Lane, and as this is your  first wisit, why, I'll make you a present of some tea--wot do you  drink?--black or green, or perhaps both--four pounds of one and two of  t'other. Here, Joe!\" summoning his foreman, \"put up four pounds of that  last lot of black that came in, and two pounds of superior green, and  this gentleman will tell you where to leave it.--And when do you think  of starting?\" again addressing the Yorkshireman--\"egad this is fine  weather for the country--have half a mind to have a jaunt myself--makes  one quite young--feel as if I'd laid full fifty years aside, and were  again a boy--when did you say you start?\" \"Why, I don't know exactly,\"  replied the Yorkshireman, \"the weather's so fine that I'm half tempted  to go round by Newmarket.\" \"Newmarket!\" exclaimed Jorrocks, throwing  his arm in the air, while his paper cap fell from his head with the  jerk--\"by Newmarket! why, what in the name of all that's impure, have  you to do at Newmarket?\"    \"Why, nothing in particular; only, when there's neither hunting nor  shooting going on, what is a man to do with himself?--I'm sure you'd  despise me if I were to go fishing.\" \"True,\" observed Mr. Jorrocks  somewhat subdued, and jingling the silver in his breeches-pocket.  \"Fox-'unting is indeed the prince of sports. The image of war, without  its guilt, and only half its danger. I confess that I'm a martyr to  it--a perfect wictim--no one knows wot I suffer from my ardour.--If ever  I'm wisited with the last infirmity of noble minds, it will be caused by  my ingovernable passion for the chase. The sight of a saddle makes me  sweat. An 'ound makes me perfectly wild. A red coat throws me into a  scarlet fever. Never throughout life have I had a good night's rest  before an 'unting morning. But werry little racing does for me; Sadler's  Wells is well enough of a fine summer evening--especially when they  plump the clown over head in the New River cut, and the ponies don't  misbehave in the Circus,--but oh! Newmarket's a dreadful place, the  werry name's a sickener. I used to hear a vast about it from poor Will  Softly of Friday Street. It was the ruin of him--and wot a fine business  his father left him, both wholesale and retail, in the tripe and  cow-heel line--all went in two years, and he had nothing to show at the  end of that time for upwards of twenty thousand golden sovereigns, but a  hundredweight of children's lamb's-wool socks, and warrants for thirteen  hogsheads of damaged sherry in the docks. No, take my adwice, and have  nothing to say to them--stay where you are, or, if you're short of swag,  come to Great Coram Street, where you shall have a bed, wear-and-tear  for your teeth, and all that sort of thing found you, and, if Saturday's  a fine day, I'll treat you with a jaunt to Margate.\"    \"You are a regular old trump,\" said the Yorkshireman, after listening  attentively until Mr. Jorrocks had exhausted himself, \"but, you see,  you've never been at Newmarket, and the people have been hoaxing you  about it. I can assure you from personal experience that the people  there are quite as honest as those you meet every day on 'Change,  besides which, there is nothing more invigorating to the human  frame--nothing more cheering to the spirits, than the sight and air of  Newmarket Heath on a fine fresh spring morning like the present. The  wind seems to go by you at a racing pace, and the blood canters up and  down the veins with the finest and freest action imaginable. A stranger  to the race-course would feel, and almost instinctively know, what turf  he was treading, and the purpose for which that turf was intended\".      \"There's a magic in the web of it.\"    \"Oh, I knows you are a most persuasive cock,\" observed Mr. Jorrocks  interrupting the Yorkshireman, \"and would conwince the devil himself  that black is white, but you'll never make me believe the Newmarket  folks are honest, and as to the fine hair (air) you talk of, there's  quite as good to get on Hampstead Heath, and if it doesn't make the  blood canter up and down your weins, you can always amuse yourself  by watching the donkeys cantering up and down with the sweet little  children--haw! haw! haw!--But tell me what is there at Newmarket that  should take a man there?\" \"What is there?\" rejoined the Yorkshireman,  \"why, there's everything that makes life desirable and constitutes  happiness, in this world, except hunting. First there is the beautiful,  neat, clean town, with groups of booted professors, ready for the  rapidest march of intellect; then there are the strings of clothed  horses--the finest in the world--passing indolently at intervals to  their exercise,--the flower of the English aristocracy residing in the  place. You leave the town and stroll to the wide open heath, where all  is brightness and space; the white rails stand forth against the dear  blue sky--the brushing gallop ever and anon startles the ear and eye;  crowds of stable urchins, full of silent importance, stud the heath; you  feel elated and long to bound over the well groomed turf and to try the  speed of the careering wind. All things at Newmarket train the mind to  racing. Life seems on the start, and dull indeed were he who could rein  in his feelings when such inspiring objects meet together to madden  them!\"    \"Bravo!\" exclaimed Jorrocks, throwing his paper cap in the air as the  Yorkshireman concluded.--\"Bravo!--werry good indeed! You speak like ten  Lord Mayors--never heard nothing better. Dash my vig, if I won't go. By  Jove, you've done it. Tell me one thing--is there a good place to feed  at?\"    \"Capital!\" replied the Yorkshireman, \"beef, mutton, cheese, ham, all  the delicacies of the season, as the sailor said\"; and thereupon the  Yorkshireman and Jorrocks shook hands upon the bargain.    Sunday night arrived, and with it arrived, at the \"Belle Sauvage,\"  in Ludgate Hill, Mr. Jorrocks's boy \"Binjimin,\" with Mr. Jorrocks's  carpet-bag; and shortly after Mr. Jorrocks, on his chestnut hunter, and  the Yorkshireman, in a hack cab, entered the yard. Having consigned his  horse to Binjimin; after giving him a very instructive lesson relative  to the manner in which he would chastise him if he heard of his trotting  or playing any tricks with the horse on his way home, Mr. Jorrocks  proceeded to pay the remainder of his fare in the coach office. The mail  was full inside and out, indeed the book-keeper assured him he could  have filled a dozen more, so anxious ware all London to see the  Riddlesworth run. \"Inside,\" said he, \"are you and your friend, and if it  wern't that the night air might give you cold, Mr. Jorrocks\" (for all  the book-keepers in London know him), \"I should have liked to have got  you outsides, and I tried to make an exchange with two black-legs, but  they would hear of nothing less than two guineas a head, which wouldn't  do, you know. Here comes another of your passengers--a great foreign  nobleman, they say--Baron something--though he looks as much like a  foreign pickpocket as anything else.\"    \"Vich be de voiture?\" inquired a tall, gaunt-looking foreigner, with  immense moustache, a high conical hat with a bright buckle, long, loose,  blueish-blackish frock-coat, very short white waistcoat, baggy brownish  striped trousers, and long-footed Wellington boots, with a sort of  Chinese turn up at the toe. \"Vich be de Newmarket Voiture?\" said he,  repeating the query, as he entered the office and deposited a silk  umbrella, a camlet cloak, and a Swiss knapsack on the counter. The  porter, without any attempt at an answer, took his goods and walked off  to the mail, followed closely by the Baron, and after depositing the  cloak inside, so that the Baron might ride with his \"face to the  horses,\" as the saying is, he turned the knapsack into the hind boot,  and swung himself into the office till it was time to ask for something  for his exertions. Meanwhile the Baron made a tour of the yard,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15399"],[0,"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The (#16)"],[1,"I de Re: the tide being complicated, she  came within a gun shot of the Nassau; but the Nassau could not bring a  gun to bear upon her, and thereby the Frenchman got off. We were twice  attacked by their fire-floats, which they chained together, and then  let them float down with the tide; but each time we sent boats with  graplings, and towed them safe out of the fleet.    We had different commanders while we were at this place, Commodores  Stanhope, Dennis, Lord Howe, &c. From hence, before the Spanish war  began, our ship and the Wasp sloop were sent to St. Sebastian in  Spain, by Commodore Stanhope; and Commodore Dennis afterwards sent our  ship as a cartel to Bayonne in France[M], after which[N] we went in  February in 1762 to Belle-Isle, and there stayed till the summer, when  we left it, and returned to Portsmouth.    After our ship was fitted out again for service, in September she went  to Guernsey, where I was very glad to see my old hostess, who was now  a widow, and my former little charming companion, her daughter. I  spent some time here very happily with them, till October, when we had  orders to repair to Portsmouth. We parted from each other with a great  deal of affection; and I promised to return soon, and see them again,  not knowing what all-powerful fate had determined for me. Our ship  having arrived at Portsmouth, we went into the harbour, and remained  there till the latter end of November, when we heard great talk about  peace; and, to our very great joy, in the beginning of December we had  orders to go up to London with our ship to be paid off. We received  this news with loud huzzas, and every other demonstration of gladness;  and nothing but mirth was to be seen throughout every part of the  ship. I too was not without my share of the general joy on this  occasion. I thought now of nothing but being freed, and working for  myself, and thereby getting money to enable me to get a good  education; for I always had a great desire to be able at least to read  and write; and while I was on shipboard I had endeavoured to improve  myself in both. While I was in the AEtna particularly, the captain's  clerk taught me to write, and gave me a smattering of arithmetic as  far as the rule of three. There was also one Daniel Queen, about forty  years of age, a man very well educated, who messed with me on board  this ship, and he likewise dressed and attended the captain.  Fortunately this man soon became very much attached to me, and took  very great pains to instruct me in many things. He taught me to shave  and dress hair a little, and also to read in the Bible, explaining  many passages to me, which I did not comprehend. I was wonderfully  surprised to see the laws and rules of my country written almost  exactly here; a circumstance which I believe tended to impress our  manners and customs more deeply on my memory. I used to tell him of  this resemblance; and many a time we have sat up the whole night  together at this employment. In short, he was like a father to me; and  some even used to call me after his name; they also styled me the  black Christian. Indeed I almost loved him with the affection of a  son. Many things I have denied myself that he might have them; and  when I used to play at marbles or any other game, and won a few  half-pence, or got any little money, which I sometimes did, for  shaving any one, I used to buy him a little sugar or tobacco, as far  as my stock of money would go. He used to say, that he and I never  should part; and that when our ship was paid off, as I was as free as  himself or any other man on board, he would instruct me in his  business, by which I might gain a good livelihood. This gave me new  life and spirits; and my heart burned within me, while I thought the  time long till I obtained my freedom. For though my master had not  promised it to me, yet, besides the assurances I had received that he  had no right to detain me, he always treated me with the greatest  kindness, and reposed in me an unbounded confidence; he even paid  attention to my morals; and would never suffer me to deceive him, or  tell lies, of which he used to tell me the consequences; and that if I  did so God would not love me; so that, from all this tenderness, I had  never once supposed, in all my dreams of freedom, that he would think  of detaining me any longer than I wished.    In pursuance of our orders we sailed from Portsmouth for the Thames,  and arrived at Deptford the 10th of December, where we cast anchor  just as it was high water. The ship was up about half an hour, when my  master ordered the barge to be manned; and all in an instant, without  having before given me the least reason to suspect any thing of the  matter, he forced me into the barge; saying, I was going to leave him,  but he would take care I should not. I was so struck with the  unexpectedness of this proceeding, that for some time I did not make a  reply, only I made an offer to go for my books and chest of clothes,  but he swore I should not move out of his sight; and if I did he would  cut my throat, at the same time taking his hanger. I began, however,  to collect myself; and, plucking up courage, I told him I was free,  and he could not by law serve me so. But this only enraged him the  more; and he continued to swear, and said he would soon let me know  whether he would or not, and at that instant sprung himself into the  barge from the ship, to the astonishment and sorrow of all on board.  The tide, rather unluckily for me, had just turned downward, so that  we quickly fell down the river along with it, till we came among some  outward-bound West Indiamen; for he was resolved to put me on board  the first vessel he could get to receive me. The boat's crew, who  pulled against their will, became quite faint different times, and  would have gone ashore; but he would not let them. Some of them strove  then to cheer me, and told me he could not sell me, and that they  would stand by me, which revived me a little; and I still entertained  hopes; for as they pulled along he asked some vessels to receive me,  but they could not. But, just as we had got a little below Gravesend,  we came alongside of a ship which was going away the next tide for the  West Indies; her name was the Charming Sally, Captain James Doran; and  my master went on board and agreed with him for me; and in a little  time I was sent for into the cabin. When I came there Captain Doran  asked me if I knew him; I answered that I did not; 'Then,' said he  'you are now my slave.' I told him my master could not sell me to him,  nor to any one else. 'Why,' said he,'did not your master buy you?' I  confessed he did. 'But I have served him,' said I,'many years, and he  has taken all my wages and prize-money, for I only got one sixpence  during the war; besides this I have been baptized; and by the laws of  the land no man has a right to sell me:' And I added, that I had heard  a lawyer and others at different times tell my master so. They both  then said that those people who told me so were not my friends; but I  replied--it was very extraordinary that other people did not know the  law as well as they. Upon this Captain Doran said I talked too much  English; and if I did not behave myself well, and be quiet, he had a  method on board to make me. I was too well convinced of his power over  me to doubt what he said; and my former sufferings in the slave-ship  presenting themselves to my mind, the recollection of them made me  shudder. However, before I retired I told them that as I could not get  any right among men here I hoped I should hereafter in Heaven; and I  immediately left the cabin, filled with resentment and sorrow. The  only coat I had with me my master took away with him, and said if my  prize-money had been 10,000 L. he had a right to it all, and would have  taken it. I had about nine guineas, which, during my long sea-faring  life, I had scraped together from trifling perquisites and little  ventures; and I hid it that instant, lest my master should take that  from me likewise, still hoping that by some means or other I should  make my escape to the shore; and indeed some of my old shipmates told  me not to despair, for they would get me back again; and that, as soon  as they could get their pay, they would immediately come to Portsmouth  to me, where this ship was going: but, alas! all my hopes were  baffled, and the hour of my deliverance was yet far off. My master,  having soon concluded his bargain with the captain, came out of the  cabin, and he and his people got into the boat and put off; I followed  them with aching eyes as long as I could, and when they were out of  sight I threw myself on the deck, while my heart was ready to burst  with sorrow and anguish.
