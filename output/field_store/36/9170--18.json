Or secondly, so much pain is  introduced into the system by the violent contractions of the fibres, that  inflammation arises, which prevents future cold fits by expending a part of  the sensorial power in the extension of old vessels or the production of  new ones; and thus preventing the too great accumulation or exertion of it  in other parts of the system; or which by the great increase of stimulus  excites into great action the whole glandular system as well as the  arterial, and thence a greater quantity of sensorial power is produced in  the brain, and thus its exhaustion in any peculiar part of the system  ceases to be affected.    4. Or thirdly, in consequence of the painful or pleasurable sensation above  mentioned, desire and aversion are introduced, and inordinate volition  succeeds; which by its own exertions expends so much of the spirit of  animation, that the two other sensorial faculties, or irritation and  sensation, act so much more feebly; that the paroxysms of fever, or that  libration between the extremes of exertion and inactivity of the arterial  system, gradually subsides. On this account a temporary insanity is a  favourable sign in fevers, as I have had some opportunities of observing.    III. _Of repeated Stimulus._    1. When a stimulus is repeated more frequently than the expenditure of  sensorial power can be renewed in the acting organ, the effect of the  stimulus becomes gradually diminished. Thus if two grains of opium be  swallowed by a person unused to so strong a stimulus, all the vascular  systems in the body act with greater energy, all the secretions and the  absorption from those secreted fluids are increased in quantity; and  pleasure or pain are introduced into the system, which adds an additional  stimulus to that already too great. After some hours the sensorial power  becomes diminished in quantity, expended by the great activity of the  system; and thence, when the stimulus of the opium is withdrawn, the fibres  will not obey their usual degree of natural stimulus, and a consequent  torpor or quiescence succeeds, as is experienced by drunkards, who on the  day after a great excess of spirituous potation feel indigestion, head-ach,  and general debility.    In this fit of torpor or quiescence of a part or of the whole of the  system, an accumulation of the sensorial power in the affected fibres is  formed, and occasions a second paroxysm of exertion by the application only  of the natural stimulus, and thus a libration of the sensorial exertion  between one excess and the other continues for two or three days, where the  stimulus was violent in degree; and for weeks in some fevers, from the  stimulus of contagious matter.    But if a second dose of opium be exhibited before the fibres have regained  their natural quantity of sensorial power, its effect will be much less  than the former, because the spirit of animation or sensorial power is in  part exhausted by the previous excess of exertion. Hence all medicines  repeated too frequently gradually lose their effect, as opium and wine.  Many things of disagreeable taste at first cease to be disagreeable by  frequent repetition, as tobacco; grief and pain gradually diminish, and at  length cease altogether, and hence life itself becomes tolerable.    Besides the temporary diminution of the spirit of animation or sensorial  power, which is naturally stationary or resident in every living fibre, by  a single exhibition of a powerful stimulus, the contractile fibres  themselves, by the perpetual application of a new quantity of stimulus,  before they have regained their natural quantity of sensorial power, appear  to suffer in their capability of receiving so much as the natural quantity  of sensorial power; and hence a permanent deficiency of spirit of animation  takes place, however long the stimulus may have been withdrawn. On this  cause depends the permanent debility of those, who have been addicted to  intoxication, the general weakness of old age, and the natural debility or  inirritability of those, who have pale skins and large pupils of their  eyes.    There is a curious phenomenon belongs to this place, which has always  appeared difficult of solution; and that is, that opium or aloes may be  exhibited in small doses at first, and gradually increased to very large  ones without producing stupor or diarrhoea. In this case, though the opium  and aloes are given in such small doses as not to produce intoxication or  catharsis, yet they are exhibited in quantities sufficient in some degree  to exhaust the sensorial power, and hence a stronger and a stronger dose is  required; otherwise the medicine would soon cease to act at all.    On the contrary, if the opium or aloes be exhibited in a large dose at  first, so as to produce intoxication or diarrhoea; after a few repetitions  the quantity of either of them may be diminished, and they will still  produce this effect. For the more powerful stimulus dissevers the  progressive catenations of animal motions, described in Sect. XVII. and  introduces a new link between them; whence every repetition strengthens  this new association or catenation, and the stimulus may be gradually  decreased, or be nearly withdrawn, and yet the effect shall continue;  because the sensorial power of association or catenation being united with  the stimulus, increases in energy with every repetition of the catenated  circle; and it is by these means that all the irritative associations of  motions are originally produced.    2. When a stimulus is repeated at such distant intervals of time, that the  natural quantity of sensorial power becomes completely restored in the  acting fibres, it will act with the same energy as when first applied.  Hence those who have lately accustomed themselves to large doses of opium  by beginning with small ones, and gradually increasing them, and repeating  them frequently, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph; if they intermit  the use of it for a few days only, must begin again with as small doses as  they took at first, otherwise they will experience the inconveniences of  intoxication.    On this circumstance depend the constant unfailing effects of the various  kinds of stimulus, which excite into action all the vascular systems in the  body; the arterial, venous, absorbent, and glandular vessels, are brought  into perpetual unwearied action by the fluids, which are adapted to  stimulate them; but these have the sensorial power of association added to  that of irritation, and even in some degree that of sensation, and even of  volition, as will be spoken of in their places; and life itself is thus  carried on by the production of sensorial power being equal to its waste or  expenditure in the perpetual movement of the vascular organization.    3. When a stimulus is repeated at uniform intervals of time with such  distances between them, that the expenditure of sensorial power in the  acting fibres becomes completely renewed, the effect is produced with  greater facility or energy. For the sensorial power of association is  combined with the sensorial power of irritation, or, in common language,  the acquired habit assists the power of the stimulus.    This circumstance not only obtains in the annual and diurnal catenations of  animal motions explained in Sect. XXXVI. but in every less circle of  actions or ideas, as in the burthen of a song, or the iterations of a  dance; and constitutes the pleasure we receive from repetition and  imitation; as treated of in Sect. XXII. 2.    4. When a stimulus has been many times repeated at uniform intervals, so as  to produce the complete action of the organ, it may then be gradually  diminished, or totally withdrawn, and the action of the organ will  continue. For the sensorial power of association becomes united with that  of irritation, and by frequent repetition becomes at length of sufficient  energy to carry on the new link in the circle of actions, without the  irritation which at first introduced it.    Hence, when the bark is given at stated intervals for the cure of  intermittent fevers, if sixty grains of it be given every three hours for  the twenty-four hours preceding the expected paroxysm, so as to stimulate  the defective part of the system into action, and by that means to prevent  the torpor or quiescence of the fibres, which constitutes the cold fit;  much less than half the quantity, given before the time at which another  paroxysm of quiescence would have taken place, will be sufficient to  prevent it; because now the sensorial power, termed association, acts in a  twofold manner. First, in respect to the period of the catenation in which  the cold fit was produced, which is now dissevered by the stronger stimulus  of the first doses of the bark; and, secondly, because each dose of bark  being repeated at periodical times, has its effect increased by the  sensorial faculty of association being combined with that of irritation.    Now, when sixty grains of Peruvian bark are taken twice a day, suppose at  ten o'clock and at six, for a fortnight, the irritation excited by this  additional stimulus becomes a part of the diurnal circle of actions, and  will at length carry on the increased action of the system without the  assistance of the stimulus of the bark. On this theory the bitter  medicines, chalybeates, and opiates in appropriated doses, exhibited for a  fortnight, give permanent strength to pale feeble children, and other weak  constitutions.    5. When a defect of stimulus, as of heat, recurs at certain diurnal  intervals, which induces some torpor or quiescence of a part of the system,  the diurnal catenation of actions becomes disordered, and a new association  with this link of torpid action is formed; on the next period the quantity  of quiescence will be increased, suppose the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#16)"],[1,"    the press is slapped down on my desk.        \"Look!\" says the foreman. \"We got out some paper today, didn't we?\"        \"_We_!\" How's that for equality? He has been twenty years at his      trade and I only ten, yet he includes me.        When I am tempted to feel that my field is limited, my tools crude,      and my work unhonored and unsung, I recall a quotation I read many      years ago, and I will place it here at the end of the \"hen editor's\"      uneventful story.        Back before my mind floats that phrase, \"Buried in this burg.\" If a      person has ability, will not the world learn it?        \"If a man can write a better book, preach a better sermon, or sing a      more glorious song than his neighbor, though he build his house in      the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his door.\"    That a personal experience story may be utilized to show readers how to  do something is demonstrated in the following article taken from _The  Designer_. It was illustrated by a half-tone made from a wash drawing of  one corner of the burlap room.        A BEDROOM IN BURLAP        THE MOST SATISFACTORY ROOM IN OUR BUNGALOW        BY KATHERINE VAN DORN        Our burlap room is the show room of our bungalow. Visitors are      guided through the living-room, the bedroom, the sleeping-porch and      kitchen, and allowed to express their delight and satisfaction while      we wait with bated breath for the grand surprise to be given them.      Then, when they have concluded, we say:          \"But you should see our burlap room!\" Then we lead the way up the        stairs to the attic and again stand and wait. We know what is        coming, and, as we revel in the expressions of admiration evoked, we        again declaim with enormous pride: \"We made it all ourselves!\"        There is a solid satisfaction in making a room, especially for an      amateur who hardly expects to undertake room-making as a profession.      We regard our room as an original creation produced by our own      genius, not likely to be duplicated in our personal experience. It      grew in this wise:          When we came to the bungalow last spring the family numbered three        instead of the two of the year before. Now number three, a healthy        and bouncing young woman, necessitated a \"sleeping-in\" maid if her        parents were ever to be able to detach themselves from her person.        We had never had a sleeping-in maid at the bungalow before and the        problem of where to put her was a serious one. We well knew that no        self-respecting servant would condescend to sleep in an attic,        although the attic was cool, airy and comfortable. We rather        thought, too, that the maid might despise us if we gave her the        bedroom and took up our quarters under the rafters. It would be an        easy enough matter for carpenters and plasterers to put a room in        the attic, but we lacked the money necessary for such a venture. And        so we puzzled. At first we thought of curtains, but the high winds        which visit us made curtains impracticable. Then we thought of        tacking the curtains top and bottom, and from this the idea        evolved. The carpenter whom we consulted proved to be amenable to        suggestion and agreed to put us up a framework in a day. We helped.        We outlined the room on the floor. This took two strips of wood        about one and a half by two inches. The other two sides of the room        were formed by the wall of the attic and by the meeting place of the        roof and floor--that is, there was in reality no fourth wall; the        room simply ended where floor and roof met. Two strips were nailed        to the rafters in positions similar to those on the floor, and then        an upright strip was inserted and nailed fast at intervals of every        three feet. This distance was decided by the fact that curtain        materials usually come a yard wide. For a door we used a discarded        screen-door, which, having been denuded of the bits of wire clinging        to it, answered the purpose very well. The door completed the        skeleton.          We used a beautiful soft blue burlap. Tacking on proved a more        difficult matter than we had anticipated, owing to the fact that our        carpenter had used cypress for the framework. We stretched the        material taut and then tacked it fast with sharp-pointed,        large-headed brass tacks, and while inserting these we measured        carefully the distances between the tacks in order to keep this        trimming uniform. The two walls supplied by the framework were        quickly covered, but the rough wall of the attic necessitated some        cutting, as we had to tack the burlap to the uprights and these had        not been placed with yard-wide material in view. Above the        screen-door frame was a hiatus of space running up into the peak.        The carpenter had thoughtfully run two strips up to the roof and        this enabled us to fill in by cutting and turning in the cloth. A        corresponding space above the window received similar treatment.        Then we covered the inner surface of the screen door and we had a        room.          But we were far from satisfied. The room looked bare and crude. We        bought a can of dark-oak stain and gave the floor a coat and this        improved matters so much that we stained the wood visible on the        door frame and about the window. Having finished this, we saw the        need of doing something for the ceiling. The ceiling was merely the        inner surface of the roof. The builders had made it of boards of        varying sizes, the rafters were rough and splintery and there were        myriads of nails sticking through everywhere. It looked a hopeless        task. But we bought more stain and went to work. Before beginning we        covered our precious blue walls with newspapers, donned our oldest        clothes and spread papers well over the floor. It was well that we        did. The staining was not difficult work but the nails made it        splashy and we were pretty well spotted when we finished.          But when we did finish we felt compensated. The nails had become        invisible. The dull blue walls with their bright brass trimming, the        soft brown floor and the stained, raftered roof made the room the        most attractive in the house. We could not rest, although the hour        was late and we were both tired, until we had furnished it. We put        in a couple of small rugs, a brass bed, and a white bureau. We hung        two pictures securely upon the uprights of the skeleton. We added a        couple of chairs and a rack for clothing, put up a white madras        curtain at the window, and regarded the effect with the utmost        satisfaction. The room answered the purpose exactly. The burlap was        thick enough to act as a screen. It was possible to see movement        through it, but not form. It insured privacy and still permitted the        air to pass through for ventilation. As a finishing touch we screwed        a knob on the outside of the door, put a brass hook on the inside        and went downstairs to count the cost.          As a quick and inexpensive method of adding to the number of rooms        in one's house, the making of a burlap room is without an equal. The        idea is not patented, and we who deem ourselves its creators, are        only too happy to send it on, in the hope that it may be of service        to some other puzzled householder who is wondering where to put an        added family member.    THE CONFESSION STORY. Closely akin to the personal experience article is  the so-called \"confession story.\" Usually published anonymously,  confession stories may reveal more personal and intimate experiences  than a writer would ordinarily care to give in a signed article.  Needless to say, most readers are keenly interested in such revelations,  even though they are made anonymously. Like personal experience stories,  they are told in the first person with a liberal use of the pronoun \"I.\"    A writer need not confine himself to his own experiences for confession  stories; he may obtain valuable material for them from others. Not  infrequently his name is attached to these articles accompanied by the  statement that the confession was \"transcribed,\" \"taken down,\" or  \"recorded\" by the writer.    Conditions of life in classes of society with which the reader is not  familiar may be brought home to him through the medium of the confession  story. It may be made the means of arousing interest in questions about  which the average reader cares little. The average man or woman, for  example, is probably little concerned with the problem of the poorly  paid college professor, but hundreds of thousands doubtless read with  interest the leading article in an issue of the _Saturday Evening Post_  entitled, \"The Pressure on the Professor.\" This was a confession story,  which did not give the author's own experiences but appeared as  \"Transcribed by Walter E. Weyl.\" This article was obviously written with  the purpose, skillfully concealed, of calling attention to the hard lot  of the underpaid professor.    Constructive criticism of existing conditions may be successfully  embodied in the form of a confession article that describes the evils as  they have been experienced by one individual. If the article is to be  entirely effective and just, the experience of the one person described  must be fairly typical of that of others in the same situation. In order  to show that these experiences are characteristic, the writer may find  it advantageous to introduce facts and figures tending to prove that his  own case is not an isolated example.
