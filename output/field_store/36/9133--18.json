It was greeted with a burst of admiration and applause.    \"What a beauty!\" cried Rosie and Lulu, clapping their hands.    \"And how large!\" exclaimed Max, \"three times as big as any I ever saw  before.\"    Walter and Gracie were no less enthusiastic in their admiration. \"May we  go close up, mamma?\" asked the latter.    \"Yes, 'course we may,\" said Walter, seizing her hand, \"we'll walk round it  and look hard at the things, but not touch 'em.\"    Older people followed the lead of the little ones, and the tree was  thoroughly examined by many pairs of eyes, gazed at from every point of  view, and highly extolled, before the work of despoiling it was begun.    The gifts were far too many to mention in detail. The older people seemed  much pleased with some easels, brackets, and picture-frames carved for  them by Max and Lulu, and with specimens of Zoe's and Rosie's handiwork in  another line; also with some little gems of art from the pencils or  brushes of Lester, Elsie, and Violet, while the children were made happy  with presents suited to the years and taste of each.    Lulu was almost wild with delight over a set of pink coral, as nearly like  that she had lost by her misconduct some months before, as Grandma Elsie  had been able to find.    Then there was a beautiful, thoroughly furnished work-box from Mamma Vi,  with \"actually a gold thimble in it,\" to encourage her in learning to sew.  One for Gracie also exactly like it, except that Lulu's was lined with red  satin and Gracie's with blue. Each had beside a new doll with a neat  little trunk packed full of clothes made to fit it, and a box filled with  pretty things to make up into doll clothes.    Max was greatly surprised and delighted by finding himself the possessor  of a watch, doubly valuable to him as his father's gift.    The gold thimbles of the little girls were also from papa.    They had a number of other presents, but these were what they valued most  highly.    It took quite a good while to distribute the gifts and for each to examine  and admire all his own and those of his neighbors; then Gracie, tired with  excitement and the long drive of the afternoon, was ready to go to bed.    Mamma Vi went with her, as was her custom, and Max and Lulu followed. They  had grown quite fond of Violet's half-sisterly, half-motherly talks with  them at the close of the day, and to her it was a source of deep joy and  thankfulness that she could perceive that she was influencing them--her  dear husband's tenderly loved offspring--for good.    She warmly sympathized in their pleasure to-night, chatted with them about  what they had given and received, praising highly the picture-frame and  easel they had presented her--and in regard to the entries to be made in  each of their diaries.    She left them in her boudoir busy with these when she returned to the  parlor.    \"O Max,\" said Lulu, \"how different Mamma Vi is from Aunt Beulah.\"    \"Humph, I should think so,\" said Max, \"must have been made of a different  kind o' dust. We weren't so well off and happy last Christmas eve, Lu.\"    \"No, indeed! Gracie and I wanted a Christmas tree ever so much, and begged  and coaxed for one, even if it was but a wee bit of a thing; but she  wouldn't let us have it, said it was just nonsense and a wicked waste.\"    \"Just like her,\" remarked Max, in a tone of mingled aversion and contempt;  \"but don't let's talk about her. I'd rather think of pleasanter subjects.  Wasn't it splendid in papa to give me this watch?\" pulling it out and  gazing on it with pride and delight. \"Isn't it a beauty?\"    \"Yes; and I'm as glad as I can be that you have it, Max,\" Lulu responded  affectionately. \"And wasn't it good in him to give gold thimbles to Gracie  and me? I shall try very hard to learn to sew nicely, to show him I'm  grateful for it and all he does for me.\"    \"That's right, Lu; let's both do our best to improve all our  opportunities, so that we will make his heart glad. And we can do that in  another way, too.\"    \"How?\"    \"By loving Mamma Vi, and being as good to her as ever we know how.\"    \"I do mean to, for she is good and kind to us,\" said Lulu, in a frankly  cordial tone.    \"You were vexed at papa at first for marrying her,\" remarked Max, with a  roguish look; \"but just suppose he'd taken Mrs. Scrimp instead.\"    \"O Max!\" cried Lulu, her eyes flashing, \"how can you talk so? You know  papa would never have thought of such a thing.\"    \"I don't believe he would, but Ann told me once she knew Mrs. Scrimp would  be glad enough to take him if he'd give her the chance. What would you  have done if he had?\"    \"I don't know, and it isn't worth while to consider,\" replied Lulu, with a  grown-up air she occasionally assumed, much to Max's amusement. \"But my  writing's done, and I'm going to bed, for I'm tired and sleepy. So  good-night.\"    \"Good-night,\" returned Max. \"I sha'n't be in a hurry to get to bed, for it  won't be worth while to get up early to catch other folks, as all the  things have been given to-night. I almost wish they had let us wait till  to-morrow morning.\"    Perhaps the remark was intended to throw Lulu off her guard; at all events  he was at her door with a \"Merry Christmas,\" before any one else was  stirring but the servants.    Lulu was awake, too, sitting up in bed and trying, in the dim light of the  early dawn, to undo a small paper parcel she had found on her pillow.    Max had opened the door and given his greeting in a subdued tone that  there might be no danger of disturbing any sleeper in the vicinity.    \"Oh!\" cried Lulu, in a voice of suppressed eagerness, \"the same to you!  Come in and see what Santa Claus has brought me.\"    Max stepped in, closed the door, and tiptoeing to a window, raised the  blind and drew back the curtain.    \"O Max, Max; just see!\" cried Lulu, as he turned toward her again.    She had succeeded in her efforts, and was now holding up her hand in a way  to display to advantage a very pretty gold ring.    \"Yes; oh, I'm glad, Lu! And there's something else, isn't there?\"    \"Money! a good deal, isn't it, Max?\" she asked, holding out a crisp new  bank-note.    \"Five dollars,\" he answered, taking it to the light. \"And I have just the  same; found it on my pillow, from papa; and s'pose yours is, too. A gold  pencil from Mamma Vi was there also.\"    \"Yes; from papa,\" she said, examining the writing on the back of the  envelope from which she had taken the note, \"and the ring's from Mamma Vi.  She always finds out just what I want. I'd rather have had a ring than  almost anything else.\"    \"There, we have waked her and Gracie, I'm afraid,\" said Max, in a tone of  self-reproach, as the voices of the two were heard coming from the next  room.    \"Merry Christmas, Max and Lulu,\" both called out in cheery tones, and the  greeting was returned with added thanks to Violet for her gifts.    \"I have some, too,\" Gracie said; \"a lovely picture-book and two kinds of  money. I think I'm the richest.\"    She had received a one-dollar bill, crisp and new like the others, and a  quarter eagle in gold, and could not be convinced that the two did not  amount to more than Max's or Lulu's five-dollar note.    The other members of the family had fared quite as well. The children had  a very merry day; the older people were quietly happy.    There were fresh flowers on the graves in the family burial-ground, even  the dead had not been forgotten. Elsie Travilla had been early bending  over the lowly mound that covered all that was mortal of her heart's best  earthly treasure, and though the sweet face was calm and serene as was its  wont, bearing no traces of tears, the cheery words and bright smile came  readily in sympathy with the mirth of the younger ones; her father and  older children, noting the occasional far-off look in the soft brown eyes,  knew that her thoughts were ever and anon with the husband of her youth.          CHAPTER XII.                                \"Oh! only those      Whose souls have felt this one idolatry,      Can tell how precious is the slightest thing      Affection gives and hallows! A dead flower      Will long be kept, remembrancer of looks      That made each leaf a treasure.\"                          --Miss Landon.      The whole family connection living in the neighborhood had dined at Ion  that Christmas day, and several had stayed to tea. But all had now gone,  the good-nights had been said among the members of the home circle, and  Elsie Travilla was alone in her own apartments.    A little weary with the cares and excitement of the day, she was half  reclining on a sofa, in dressing-gown and slippers, her beautiful hair  unbound and rippling over her shoulders, beside her a jewel-box of ebony  inlaid with mother-of-pearl.    It stood open, and the lamplight falling upon its contents was flashed  back from many a costly gem set in rings, brooches, lockets and chains of  gold.    She took them up, one by one, gazing upon each for a minute or more with a  smile, a sigh, or a falling tear, ere she laid it almost tenderly back in  its place.    So absorbed was she in the contemplation of these mementoes of the past  and the memories called up by them, that she did not hear an approaching  footstep, and deemed herself quite alone, till a hand was laid gently on  her head, and a voice said tenderly, \"My darling!\"    \"Dear papa!\" she responded, glancing up into his face with tear-dimmed  eyes, as he stood at the back of her sofa, bending over her. \"Let me give  you a chair,\" and she would have risen to do so, but he forced her gently  back.    \"No; lie still. I will help myself.\" And coming round in front of her, he  seated himself close at her side.    \"Why look at these, if it makes you sad, my child?\" he asked, noticing her  occupation.    \"There is sometimes a sweetness in the tears called forth by pleasant  memories of loved ones gone before, papa,\" she said. \"These anniversaries  will recall the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#16)"],[1," six weeks about, and retired, leaving Aladdin alone in the hall. He took  the lamp, which he carried about him, rubbed it, and presently the genie  appeared. \"Genie,\" said Aladdin, \"I ordered thee to leave one of the  four-and-twenty windows of this hall imperfect, and thou hast executed  my commands punctually; now I would have thee make it like the rest.\"  The genie immediately disappeared. Aladdin went out of the hall, and  returning soon after, found the window, as he wished it to be, like the  others.    In the mean time, the jewellers and goldsmiths repaired to the palace,  and were introduced into the sultan's presence; where the chief jeweller  presented the precious stones which he had brought back. The sultan  asked them if Aladdin had given them any reason for so doing, and they  answering that he had given them none, he ordered a horse to be brought,  which he mounted, and rode to his son-in-law's palace, with some few  attendants on foot, to inquire why he had ordered the completion of the  window to be stopped. Aladdin met him at the gate, and without giving  any reply to his inquiries conducted him to the grand saloon, where the  sultan, to his great surprise, found the window, which was left  imperfect, to correspond exactly with the others. He fancied at first  that he was mistaken, and examined the two windows on each side, and  afterward all the four-and-twenty; but when he was convinced that the  window which several workmen had been so long about was finished in so  short a time, he embraced Aladdin and kissed him between his eyes. \"My  son,\" said he, \"what a man you are to do such surprising things always  in the twinkling of an eye! there is not your fellow in the world; the  more I know, the more I admire you.\"    The sultan returned to the palace, and after this went frequently to the  window to contemplate and admire the wonderful palace of his son-in-law.    Aladdin did not confine himself in his palace, but went with much state,  sometimes to one mosque, and sometimes to another, to prayers, or to  visit the grand vizier or the principal lords of the court. Every time  he went out, he caused two slaves, who walked by the side of his horse,  to throw handfuls of money among the people as he passed through the  streets and squares. This generosity gained him the love and blessings  of the people, and it was common for them to swear by his head. Thus  Aladdin, while he paid all respect to the sultan, won by his affable  behaviour and liberality the affections of the people.    Aladdin had conducted himself in this manner several years, when the  African magician, who had for some years dismissed him from his  recollection, determined to inform himself with certainty whether he  perished, as he supposed, in the subterranean cave or not. After he had  resorted to a long course of magic ceremonies, and had formed a  horoscope by which to ascertain Aladdin's fate, what was his surprise to  find the appearances to declare that Aladdin, instead of dying in the  cave, had made his escape, and was living in royal splendour, by the aid  of the genie of the wonderful lamp!    On the very next day, the magician set out and travelled with the utmost  haste to the capital of China, where, on his arrival, he took up his  lodgings in a khan.    He then quickly learnt about the wealth, charities, happiness, and  splendid palace of Prince Aladdin. Directly he saw the wonderful fabric,  he knew that none but the genies, the slaves of the lamp, could have  performed such wonders, and, piqued to the quick at Aladdin's high  estate, he returned to the khan.    On his return he had recourse to an operation of geomancy to find out  where the lamp was--whether Aladdin carried it about with him, or where  he left it. The result of his consultation informed him, to his great  joy, that the lamp was in the palace. \"Well,\" said he, rubbing his hands  in glee, \"I shall have the lamp, and I shall make Aladdin return to his  original mean condition.\"    The next day the magician learnt, from the chief superintendent of the  khan where he lodged, that Aladdin had gone on a hunting expedition,  which was to last for eight days, of which only three had expired. The  magician wanted to know no more, He resolved at once on his plans. He  went to a coppersmith, and asked for a dozen copper lamps: the master of  the shop told him he had not so many by him, but if he would have  patience till the next day, he would have them ready. The magician  appointed his time, and desired him to take care that they should be  handsome and well polished.    The next day the magician called for the twelve lamps, paid the man his  full price, put them into a basket hanging on his arm, and went directly  to Aladdin's palace. As he approached, he began crying, \"Who will  exchange old lamps for new ones?\" As he went along, a crowd of children  collected, who hooted, and thought him, as did all who chanced to be  passing by, a madman or a fool, to offer to change new lamps for old  ones.    The African magician regarded not their scoffs, hootings, or all they  could say to him, but still continued crying, \"Who will change old lamps  for new ones?\" He repeated this so often, walking backward and forward  in front of the palace, that the princess, who was then in the hall with  the four-and-twenty windows, hearing a man cry something, and seeing a  great mob crowding about him, sent one of her women slaves to know what  he cried.    The slave returned, laughing so heartily that the princess rebuked her.  \"Madam,\" answered the slave, laughing still, \"who can forbear laughing,  to see an old man with a basket on his arm, full of fine new lamps,  asking to change them for old ones? the children and mob crowding about  him, so that he can hardly stir, make all the noise they can in derision  of him.\"    Another female slave hearing this, said, \"Now you speak of lamps, I know  not whether the princess may have observed it, but there is an old one  upon a shelf of the Prince Aladdin's robing room, and whoever owns it  will not be sorry to find a new one in its stead. If the princess  chooses, she may have the pleasure of trying if this old man is so silly  as to give a new lamp for an old one, without taking anything for the  exchange.\"    The princess, who knew not the value of this lamp, and the interest that  Aladdin had to keep it safe, entered into the pleasantry, and commanded  a slave to take it and make the exchange. The slave obeyed, went out of  the hall, and no sooner got to the palace gates than he saw the African  magician, called to him, and showing him the old lamp, said, \"Give me a  new lamp for this.\"    The magician never doubted but this was the lamp he wanted. There could  be no other such in this palace, where every utensil was gold or silver.  He snatched it eagerly out of the slave's hand, and thrusting it as far  as he could into his breast, offered him his basket, and bade him choose  which he liked best. The slave picked out one and carried it to the  princess; but the change was no sooner made than the place rung with the  shouts of the children, deriding the magician's folly.    The African magician stayed no longer near the palace, nor cried any  more, \"New lamps for old ones,\" but made the best of his way to his  khan. His end was answered, and by his silence he got rid of the  children and the mob.    As soon as he was out of sight of the two palaces, he hastened down the  least-frequented streets; and having no more occasion for his lamps or  basket, set all down in a spot where nobody saw him; then going down  another street or two, he walked till he came to one of the city gates,  and pursuing his way through the suburbs, which were very extensive, at  length reached a lonely spot, where he stopped till the darkness of the  night, as the most suitable time for the design he had in contemplation.  When it became quite dark, he pulled the lamp out of his breast and  rubbed it. At that summons the genie appeared, and said, \"What wouldst  thou have? I am ready to obey thee as thy slave, and the slave of all  those who have that lamp in their hands, both I and the other slaves of  the lamp.\" \"I command thee,\" replied the magician, \"to transport me  immediately, and the palace which thou and the other slaves of the lamp  have built in this city, with all the people in it, to Africa.\" The  genie made no reply, but with the assistance of the other genies, the  slaves of the lamp, immediately transported him and the palace, entire,  to the spot whither he had been desired to convey it.    Early the next morning, when the sultan, according to custom, went to  contemplate and admire Aladdin's place, his amazement was unbounded to  find that it could nowhere be seen. He could not comprehend how so large  a palace which he had seen plainly every day for some years, should  vanish so soon, and not leave the least remains behind. In his  perplexity he ordered the grand vizier to be sent for with expedition.    The grand vizier, who, in secret, bore no good will to Aladdin,  intimated his suspicion that the palace was built by magic, and that  Aladdin had made his hunting excursion an excuse for the removal of his  palace with the same suddenness with which it had been erected. He  induced the sultan to send a detachment of his guard, and to have  Aladdin seized as a prisoner of state. On his son-in-law being brought  before him, he would not hear a word from him, but ordered him to be put  to death. The decree caused so much discontent among the people, whose  affection Aladdin had secured by his largesses and charities, that the  sultan, fearful of an insurrection, was obliged to grant him his life.  When Aladdin found himself at liberty, he again addressed the sultan:  \"Sire, I pray you to let me know the crime by which I have thus lost the  favour of thy countenance.\" \"Your crime!\" answered the sultan, \"wretched  man! do you"]]]
