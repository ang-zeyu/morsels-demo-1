Mrs. Godfrey  brought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their disposition,  and would have drawn me on again; but I declared absolutely my  resolution to have nothing more to do with that family.  This was  resented by the Godfreys; we differ'd, and they removed, leaving me the  whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.    But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'd round  me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places; but soon found  that, the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one, I  was not to expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as I should  not otherwise think agreeable.  In the mean time, that  hard-to-be-governed passion of youth hurried me frequently into  intrigues with low women that fell in my way, which were attended with  some expense and great inconvenience, besides a continual risque to my  health by a distemper which of all things I dreaded, though by great  good luck I escaped it.  A friendly correspondence as neighbors and old  acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs. Read's family, who all  had a regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house.  I was often invited there and consulted in their affairs, wherein I  sometimes was of service.  I piti'd poor Miss Read's unfortunate  situation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful, and avoided  company.  I considered my giddiness and inconstancy when in London as  in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness, tho' the mother was  good enough to think the fault more her own than mine, as she had  prevented our marrying before I went thither, and persuaded the other  match in my absence.  Our mutual affection was revived, but there were  now great objections to our union.  The match was indeed looked upon as  invalid, a preceding wife being said to be living in England; but this  could not easily be prov'd, because of the distance; and, tho' there  was a report of his death, it was not certain.  Then, tho' it should be  true, he had left many debts, which his successor might be call'd upon  to pay.  We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took  her to wife, September 1st, 1730.  None of the inconveniences happened  that we had apprehended, she proved a good and faithful helpmate,  assisted me much by attending the shop; we throve together, and have  ever mutually endeavored to make each other happy.  Thus I corrected  that great erratum as well as I could.    About this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a little  room of Mr. Grace's, set apart for that purpose, a proposition was made  by me, that, since our books were often referr'd to in our  disquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have  them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be  consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we  should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the  advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be  nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.  It was lik'd and  agreed to, and we fill'd one end of the room with such books as we  could best spare.  The number was not so great as we expected; and tho'  they had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurring for want  of due care of them, the collection, after about a year, was separated,  and each took his books home again    And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for a  subscription library.  I drew up the proposals, got them put into form  by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends in the  Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin  with, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our company  was to continue.  We afterwards obtain'd a charter, the company being  increased to one hundred:  this was the mother of all the North  American subscription libraries, now so numerous.  It is become a great  thing itself, and continually increasing.  These libraries have  improved the general conversation of the Americans, made the common  tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other  countries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so  generally made throughout the colonies in defense of their privileges.    Memo.  Thus far was written with the intention express'd in the  beginning and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no  importance to others.  What follows was written many years after in  compliance with the advice contain'd in these letters, and accordingly  intended for the public.  The affairs of the Revolution occasion'd the  interruption.         Letter from Mr. Abel James, with Notes of my Life                      (received in Paris).    \"MY DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND:  I have often been desirous of writing to  thee, but could not be reconciled to the thought that the letter might  fall into the hands of the British, lest some printer or busy-body  should publish some part of the contents, and give our friend pain, and  myself censure.    \"Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy, about  twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing an account of  the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son, ending in the  year 1730, with which there were notes, likewise in thy writing; a copy  of which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means, if thou continued it up  to a later period, that the first and latter part may be put together;  and if it is not yet continued, I hope thee will not delay it.  Life is  uncertain, as the preacher tells us; and what will the world say if  kind, humane, and benevolent Ben.  Franklin should leave his friends  and the world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work  which would be useful and entertaining not only to a few, but to  millions?  The influence writings under that class have on the minds of  youth is very great, and has nowhere appeared to me so plain, as in our  public friend's journals.  It almost insensibly leads the youth into  the resolution of endeavoring to become as good and eminent as the  journalist.  Should thine, for instance, when published (and I think it  could not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and  temperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class would  such a work be!  I know of no character living, nor many of them put  together, who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater  spirit of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and  temperance with the American youth.  Not that I think the work would  have no other merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first is  of such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it.\"      The foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shown to a  friend, I received from him the following:         Letter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan.                                   \"PARIS, January 31, 1783.    \"My DEAREST SIR:  When I had read over your sheets of minutes of the  principal incidents of your life, recovered for you by your Quaker  acquaintance, I told you I would send you a letter expressing my  reasons why I thought it would be useful to complete and publish it as  he desired.  Various concerns have for some time past prevented this  letter being written, and I do not know whether it was worth any  expectation; happening to be at leisure, however, at present, I shall  by writing, at least interest and instruct myself; but as the terms I  am inclined to use may tend to offend a person of your manners, I shall  only tell you how I would address any other person, who was as good and  as great as yourself, but less diffident.  I would say to him, Sir, I  solicit the history of your life from the following motives:  Your  history is so remarkable, that if you do not give it, somebody else  will certainly give it; and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm, as  your own management of the thing might do good.  It will moreover  present a table of the internal circumstances of your country, which  will very much tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly  minds.  And considering the eagerness with which such information is  sought by them, and the extent of your reputation, I do not know of a  more efficacious advertisement than your biography would give.  All  that has happened to you is also connected with the detail of the  manners and situation of a rising people; and in this respect I do not  think that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus can be more interesting  to a true judge of human nature and society.  But these, sir, are small  reasons, in my opinion, compared with the chance which your life will  give for the forming of future great men; and in conjunction with your  Art of Virtue (which you design to publish) of improving the features  of private character, and consequently of aiding all happiness, both  public and domestic.  The two works I allude to, sir, will in  particular give a noble rule and example of self-education. School and  other education constantly proceed upon false principles, and show a  clumsy apparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple,  and the mark a true one; and while parents and young persons are left  destitute of other just means of estimating and becoming prepared for a  reasonable course in life, your discovery that the thing is in many a  man's private power, will be invaluable!  Influence upon the private  character, late in life, is not only an influence late in life, but a  weak influence.  It is in youth that we plant our chief habits and  prejudices; it is in youth that we take our party as to profession,  pursuits and matrimony.  In youth, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1480"],[0,"Tom Brown's School Days (#16)"],[1,"them with their dinners. And a great big-bearded  man, whom Tom took for a master, began calling over the names, while the  great joints were being rapidly carved on the third table in the  corner by the old verger and the housekeeper. Tom's turn came last, and  meanwhile he was all eyes, looking first with awe at the great man, who  sat close to him, and was helped first, and who read a hard-looking book  all the time he was eating; and when he got up and walked off to the  fire, at the small boys round him, some of whom were reading, and the  rest talking in whispers to one another, or stealing one another's  bread, or shooting pellets, or digging their forks through the  tablecloth. However, notwithstanding his curiosity, he managed to make  a capital dinner by the time the big man called \"Stand up!\" and said  grace.    As soon as dinner was over, and Tom had been questioned by such of his  neighbours as were curious as to his birth, parentage, education, and  other like matters, East, who evidently enjoyed his new dignity of  patron and mentor, proposed having a look at the close, which Tom,  athirst for knowledge, gladly assented to; and they went out through the  quadrangle and past the big fives court, into the great playground.    \"That's the chapel, you see,\" said East; \"and there, just behind it, is  the place for fights. You see it's most out of the way of the masters,  who all live on the other side, and don't come by here after first  lesson or callings-over. That's when the fights come off. And all this  part where we are is the little-side ground, right up to the trees; and  on the other side of the trees is the big-side ground, where the great  matches are played. And there's the island in the farthest corner;  you'll know that well enough next half, when there's island fagging. I  say, it's horrid cold; let's have a run across.\" And away went East, Tom  close behind him. East was evidently putting his best foot foremost; and  Tom, who was mighty proud of his running, and not a little anxious  to show his friend that, although a new boy, he was no milksop, laid  himself down to work in his very best style. Right across the close they  went, each doing all he knew, and there wasn't a yard between them when  they pulled up at the island moat.    \"I say,\" said East, as soon as he got his wind, looking with much  increased respect at Tom, \"you ain't a bad scud, not by no means. Well,  I'm as warm as a toast now.\"    \"But why do you wear white trousers in November?\" said Tom. He had been  struck by this peculiarity in the costume of almost all the School-house  boys.    \"Why, bless us, don't you know? No; I forgot. Why, to-day's the  School-house match. Our house plays the whole of the School at football.  And we all wear white trousers, to show 'em we don't care for hacks.  You're in luck to come to-day. You just will see a match; and Brooke's  going to let me play in quarters. That's more than he'll do for any  other lower-school boy, except James, and he's fourteen.\"    \"Who's Brooke?\"    \"Why, that big fellow who called over at dinner, to be sure. He's cock  of the school, and head of the School-house side, and the best kick and  charger in Rugby.\"    \"Oh, but do show me where they play. And tell me about it. I love  football so, and have played all my life. Won't Brooke let me play?\"    \"Not he,\" said East, with some indignation. \"Why, you don't know the  rules; you'll be a month learning them. And then it's no joke playing-up  in a match, I can tell you--quite another thing from your private school  games. Why, there's been two collar-bones broken this half, and a dozen  fellows lamed. And last year a fellow had his leg broken.\"    Tom listened with the profoundest respect to this chapter of accidents,  and followed East across the level ground till they came to a sort of  gigantic gallows of two poles, eighteen feet high, fixed upright in the  ground some fourteen feet apart, with a cross-bar running from one to  the other at the height of ten feet or thereabouts.    \"This is one of the goals,\" said East, \"and you see the other, across  there, right opposite, under the Doctor's wall. Well, the match is for  the best of three goals; whichever side kicks two goals wins: and it  won't do, you see, just to kick the ball through these posts--it must go  over the cross-bar; any height'll do, so long as it's between the posts.  You'll have to stay in goal to touch the ball when it rolls behind the  posts, because if the other side touch it they have a try at goal. Then  we fellows in quarters, we play just about in front of goal here, and  have to turn the ball and kick it back before the big fellows on the  other side can follow it up. And in front of us all the big fellows  play, and that's where the scrummages are mostly.\"    Tom's respect increased as he struggled to make out his friend's  technicalities, and the other set to work to explain the mysteries  of \"off your side,\" \"drop-kicks,\" \"punts,\" \"places,\" and the other  intricacies of the great science of football.    \"But how do you keep the ball between the goals?\" said he; \"I can't see  why it mightn't go right down to the chapel.\"    \"Why; that's out of play,\" answered East. \"You see this gravel-walk  running down all along this side of the playing-ground, and the line  of elms opposite on the other? Well, they're the bounds. As soon as the  ball gets past them, it's in touch, and out of play. And then whoever  first touches it has to knock it straight out amongst the players-up,  who make two lines with a space between them, every fellow going on his  own side. Ain't there just fine scrummages then! And the three trees you  see there which come out into the play, that's a tremendous place when  the ball hangs there, for you get thrown against the trees, and that's  worse than any hack.\"    Tom wondered within himself, as they strolled back again towards the  fives court, whether the matches were really such break-neck affairs as  East represented, and whether, if they were, he should ever get to like  them and play up well.    He hadn't long to wonder, however, for next minute East cried out,  \"Hurrah! here's the punt-about; come along and try your hand at a kick.\"  The punt-about is the practice-ball, which is just brought out and  kicked about anyhow from one boy to another before callings-over and  dinner, and at other odd times. They joined the boys who had brought it  out, all small School-house fellows, friends of East; and Tom had the  pleasure of trying his skill, and performed very creditably, after first  driving his foot three inches into the ground, and then nearly kicking  his leg into the air, in vigorous efforts to accomplish a drop-kick  after the manner of East.    Presently more boys and bigger came out, and boys from other houses  on their way to calling-over, and more balls were sent for. The crowd  thickened as three o'clock approached; and when the hour struck, one  hundred and fifty boys were hard at work. Then the balls were held, the  master of the week came down in cap and gown to calling-over, and the  whole school of three hundred boys swept into the big school to answer  to their names.    \"I may come in, mayn't I?\" said Tom, catching East by the arm, and  longing to feel one of them.    \"Yes, come along; nobody'll say anything. You won't be so eager to get  into calling-over after a month,\" replied his friend; and they marched  into the big school together, and up to the farther end, where that  illustrious form, the lower fourth, which had the honour of East's  patronage for the time being, stood.    The master mounted into the high desk by the door, and one of the  praepostors of the week stood by him on the steps, the other three  marching up and down the middle of the school with their canes, calling  out, \"Silence, silence!\" The sixth form stood close by the door on the  left, some thirty in number, mostly great big grown men, as Tom thought,  surveying them from a distance with awe; the fifth form behind them,  twice their number, and not quite so big. These on the left; and on the  right the lower fifth, shell, and all the junior forms in order; while  up the middle marched the three praepostors.    Then the praepostor who stands by the master calls out the names,  beginning with the sixth form; and as he calls each boy answers \"here\"  to his name, and walks out. Some of the sixth stop at the door to turn  the whole string of boys into the close. It is a great match-day, and  every boy in the school, will he, nill he, must be there. The rest of  the sixth go forwards into the close, to see that no one escapes by any  of the side gates.    To-day, however, being the School-house match, none of the School-house  praepostors stay by the door to watch for truants of their side; there  is carte blanche to the School-house fags to go where they like. \"They  trust to our honour,\" as East proudly informs Tom; \"they know very well  that no School-house boy would cut the match. If he did, we'd very soon  cut him, I can tell you.\"    The master of the week being short-sighted, and the praepostors of the  week small and not well up to their work, the lower-school boys employ  the ten minutes which elapse before their names are called in pelting  one another vigorously with acorns, which fly about in all directions.  The small praepostors dash in every now and then, and generally chastise  some quiet, timid boy who is equally afraid of acorns and canes,  while the principal performers get dexterously out of the way. And so  calling-over rolls on somehow, much like the big world, punishments  lighting on wrong shoulders, and matters going generally in a queer,  cross-grained way, but the end coming somehow, which is, after all, the  great point. And now the master of the week has finished, and locked up  the big school; and the praepostors of the week come out, sweeping the  last remnant of the school fags,"]]]
