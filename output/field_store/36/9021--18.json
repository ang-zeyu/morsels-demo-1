[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#16)"],[1," a girl, but I never knew one who cared for  fishing.\"    \"Now you behold one. I love dear old Izaak Walton. Of course, you  have read his books?\"    \"I am ashamed to say I have not.\"    \"And you say you are a fisherman? Well, you haste a great pleasure  in store, as well as an opportunity to learn something of the  'contemplative man's recreation.' I shall lend you the books.\"    \"I have not seen a book since I came to Fort Henry.\"    \"I have a fine little library, and you are welcome to any of my  books. But to return to fishing. I love it, and yet I nearly always  allow the fish to go free. Sometimes I bring home a pretty sunfish,  place him in a tub of water, watch him and try to tame him. But I  must admit failure. It is the association which makes fishing so  delightful. The canoe gliding down a swift stream, the open air, the  blue sky, the birds and trees and flowers--these are what I love.  Come and see my canoe.\"    Thus Betty rattled on as she led the way through the sitting-room  and kitchen to Colonel Zane's magazine and store-house which opened  into the kitchen. This little low-roofed hut contained a variety of  things. Boxes, barrels and farming implements filled one corner;  packs of dried skins were piled against the wall; some otter and fox  pelts were stretched on the wall, and a number of powder kegs lined  a shelf. A slender canoe swung from ropes thrown over the rafters.  Alfred slipped it out of the loops and carried it outside.    The canoe was a superb specimen of Indian handiwork. It had a length  of fourteen feet and was made of birch bark, stretched over a light  framework of basswood. The bow curved gracefully upward, ending in a  carved image representing a warrior's head. The sides were  beautifully ornamented and decorated in fanciful Indian designs.    \"My brother's Indian guide, Tomepomehala, a Shawnee chief, made it  for me. You see this design on the bow. The arrow and the arm mean  in Indian language, 'The race is to the swift and the strong.' The  canoe is very light. See, I can easily carry it,\" said Betty,  lifting it from the grass.    She ran into the house and presently came out with two rods, a book  and a basket.    \"These are Jack's rods. He cut them out of the heart of ten-year-old  basswood trees, so he says. We must be careful of them.\"    Alfred examined the rods with the eye of a connoisseur and  pronounced them perfect.    \"These rods have been made by a lover of the art. Anyone with half  an eye could see that. What shall we use for bait?\" he said.    \"Sam got me some this morning.\"    \"Did you expect to go?\" asked Alfred, looking up in surprise.    \"Yes, I intended going, and as you said you were coming over, I  meant to ask you to accompany me.\"    \"That was kind of you.\"    \"Where are you young people going?\" called Colonel Zane, stopping in  his task.    \"We are going down to the sycamore,\" answered Betty.    \"Very well. But be certain and stay on this side of the creek and do  not go out on the river,\" said the Colonel.    \"Why, Eb, what do you mean? One might think Mr. Clarke and I were  children,\" exclaimed Betty.    \"You certainly aren't much more. But that is not my reason. Never  mind the reason. Do as I say or do not go,\" said Colonel Zane.    \"All right, brother. I shall not forget,\" said Betty, soberly,  looking at the Colonel. He had not spoken in his usual teasing way,  and she was at a loss to understand him. \"Come, Mr. Clarke, you  carry the canoe and follow me down this path and look sharp for  roots and stones or you may trip.\"    \"Where is Isaac?\" asked Alfred, as he lightly swung the canoe over  his shoulder.    \"He took his rifle and went up to the chestnut grove an hour or more  ago.\"    A few minutes' walk down the willow skirted path and they reached  the creek. Here it was a narrow stream, hardly fifty feet wide,  shallow, and full of stones over which the clear brown water rushed  noisily.    \"Is it not rather risky going down there?\" asked Alfred as he  noticed the swift current and the numerous boulders poking  treacherous heads just above the water.    \"Of course. That is the great pleasure in canoeing,\" said Betty,  calmly. \"If you would rather walk--\"    \"No, I'll go if I drown. I was thinking of you.\"    \"It is safe enough if you can handle a paddle,\" said Betty, with a  smile at his hesitation. \"And, of course, if your partner in the  canoe sits trim.\"    \"Perhaps you had better allow me to use the paddle. Where did you  learn to steer a canoe?\"    \"I believe you are actually afraid. Why, I was born on the Potomac,  and have used a paddle since I was old enough to lift one. Come,  place the canoe in here and we will keep to the near shore until we  reach the bend. There is a little fall just below this and I love to  shoot it.\"    He steadied the canoe with one hand while he held out the other to  help her, but she stepped nimbly aboard without his assistance.    \"Wait a moment while I catch some crickets and grasshoppers.\"    \"Gracious! What a fisherman. Don't you know we have had frost?\"    \"That's so,\" said Alfred, abashed by her simple remark.    \"But you might find some crickets under those logs,\" said Betty. She  laughed merrily at the awkward spectacle made by Alfred crawling  over the ground, improvising a sort of trap out of his hat, and  pouncing down on a poor little insect.    \"Now, get in carefully, and give the canoe a push. There, we are  off,\" she said, taking up the paddle.    The little bark glided slowly down stream at first hugging the bank  as though reluctant to trust itself to the deeper water, and then  gathering headway as a few gentle strokes of the paddle swerved it  into the current. Betty knelt on one knee and skillfully plied the  paddle, using the Indian stroke in which the paddle was not removed  from the water.    \"This is great!\" exclaimed Alfred, as he leaned back in the bow  facing her. \"There is nothing more to be desired. This beautiful  clear stream, the air so fresh, the gold lined banks, the autumn  leaves, a guide who--\"    \"Look,\" said Betty. \"There is the fall over which we must pass.\"    He looked ahead and saw that they were swiftly approaching two huge  stones that reared themselves high out of the water. They were only  a few yards apart and surrounded by smaller rocks, about high the  water rushed white with foam.    \"Please do not move!\" cried Betty, her eyes shining bright with  excitement.    Indeed, the situation was too novel for Alfred to do anything but  feel a keen enjoyment. He had made up his mind that he was sure to  get a ducking, but, as he watched Betty's easy, yet vigorous sweeps  with the paddle, and her smiling, yet resolute lips, he felt  reassured. He could see that the fall was not a great one, only a  few feet, but one of those glancing sheets of water like a mill  race, and he well knew that if they struck a stone disaster would be  theirs. Twenty feet above the white-capped wave which marked the  fall, Betty gave a strong forward pull on the paddle, a deep stroke  which momentarily retarded their progress even in that swift  current, and then, a short backward stroke, far under the stern of  the canoe, and the little vessel turned straight, almost in the  middle of the course between the two rocks. As she raised her paddle  into the canoe and smiled at the fascinated young man, the bow  dipped, and with that peculiar downward movement, that swift,  exhilarating rush so dearly loved by canoeists, they shot down the  smooth incline of water, were lost for a moment in a white cloud of  mist, and in another they coated into a placid pool.    \"Was not that delightful?\" she asked, with just a little conscious  pride glowing in her dark eyes.    \"Miss Zane, it was more than that. I apologize for my suspicions.  You have admirable skill. I only wish that on my voyage down the  River of Life I could have such a sure eye and hand to guide me  through the dangerous reefs and rapids.\"    \"You are poetical,\" said Betty, who laughed, and at the same time  blushed slightly. \"But you are right about the guide. Jonathan says  'always get a good guide,' and as guiding is his work he ought to  know. But this has nothing in common with fishing, and here is my  favorite place under the old sycamore.\"    With a long sweep of the paddle she ran the canoe alongside a stone  beneath a great tree which spread its long branches over the creek  and shaded the pool. It was a grand old tree and must have guarded  that sylvan spot for centuries. The gnarled and knotted trunk was  scarred and seamed with the ravages of time. The upper part was  dead. Long limbs extended skyward, gaunt and bare, like the masts of  a storm beaten vessel. The lower branches were white and shining,  relieved here and there by brown patches of bark which curled up  like old parchment as they shelled away from the inner bark. The  ground beneath the tree was carpeted with a velvety moss with little  plots of grass and clusters of maiden-hair fern growing on it. From  under an overhanging rock on the bank a spring of crystal water  bubbled forth.    Alfred rigged up the rods, and baiting a hook directed Betty to  throw her line well out into the current and let it float down into  the eddy. She complied, and hardly had the line reached the circle  of the eddy, where bits of white foam floated round and round, when  there was a slight splash, a scream from Betty and she was standing  up in the canoe holding tightly to her rod.    \"Be careful!\" exclaimed Alfred. \"Sit down. You will have the canoe  upset in a moment. Hold your rod steady and keep the line taut.  That's right. Now lead him round toward me. There,\" and grasping the  line he lifted a fine rock bass over the side of the canoe.    \"Oh! I always get so intensely excited,\" breathlessly cried Betty.  \"I can't help it. Jonathan always declares he will never take me  fishing again. Let me see the fish. It's a goggle-eye. Isn't he  pretty? Look how"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#16)"],[1,"has he with him?\" asked his  father.    \"If we get the pick of the lot it will be worth two weeks' work,\"  replied Dave. \"I saw him, and Bolly, too. I believe we can catch her  easily. She was off from the bunch, and it looks as though the mares  were jealous. I think we can run her into a cove under the wall, and get  her. Then Mescal can help us run down the stallion. And you can look out  on this end for the best level stretch to drop the line of cedars and  make our trap.\"    The brothers, at their father's nod, rode off into the forest. Naab had  detained the peon, and now gave him orders and sent him off.    \"To-night you can stand on the rim here, and watch him signal across to  the top of Echo Cliffs to the Navajos,\" explained August to Jack. \"I've  sent for the best breaker of wild mustangs on the desert. Dave can break  mustangs, and Piute is very good; but I want the best man in the  country, because this is a grand horse, and I intend to give him to  you.\"    \"To me!\" exclaimed Hare.    \"Yes, and if he's broken right at the start, he'll serve you faithfully,  and not try to bite your arm off every day, or kick your brains out. No  white man can break a wild mustang to the best advantage.\"    \"Why is that?\"    \"I don't know. To be truthful, I have an idea it's bad temper and lack  of patience. Just wait till you see this Navajo go at Silvermane!\"    After Mescal and Piute drove down the sheep, Jack accompanied Naab to  the corral.    \"I've brought up your saddle,\" said Naab, \"and you can put it on any  mustang here.\"    What a pleasure it was to be in the saddle again, and to feel strength  to remain there! He rode with August all over the western end of the  plateau. They came at length to a strip of ground, higher than the  bordering forest, which was comparatively free of cedars and brush; and  when August had surveyed it once he slapped his knee with satisfaction.    \"Fine, better than I hoped for! This stretch is about a mile long, and  narrow at this end. Now, Jack, you see the other side faces the rim,  this side the forest, and at the end here is a wall of rock; luckily it  curves in a half circle, which will save us work. We'll cut cedars, drag  them in line, and make a big corral against the rock. From the opening  in the corral we'll build two fences of trees; then we'll chase  Silvermane till he's done, run him down into this level, and turn him  inside the fence. No horse can break through a close line of cedars.  He'll run till he's in the corral, and then we'll rope him.\"    \"Great!\" said Jack, all enthusiasm. \"But isn't it going to take a lot of  work?\"    \"Rather,\" said August, dryly. \"It'll take a week to cut and drag the  cedars, let alone to tire out that wild stallion. When the finish comes  you want to be on that ledge where we'll have the corral.\"    They returned to camp and prepared supper. Mescal and Piute soon  arrived, and, later, Dave and Billy on jaded mustangs. Black Bolly  limped behind, stretching a long halter, an unhappy mustang with dusty,  foam-stained coat and hanging head.    \"Not bad,\" said August, examining the lame leg. \"She'll be fit in a few  days, long before we need her to help run down Silvermane. Bring the  liniment and a cloth, one of you, and put her in the sheep-corral to-  night.\"    Mescal's love for the mustang shone in her eyes while she smoothed out  the crumpled mane, and petted the slender neck.    \"Bolly, to think you'd do it!\" And Bolly dropped her head as though  really ashamed.    When darkness fell they gathered on the rim to watch the signals. A fire  blazed out of the black void below, and as they waited it brightened and  flamed higher.    \"Ugh!\" said Piute, pointing across to the dark line of cliffs.    \"Of course he'd see it first,\" laughed Naab. \"Dave, have you caught it  yet? Jack, see if you can make out a fire over on Echo Cliffs.\"    \"No, I don't see any light, except that white star. Have you seen it?\"    \"Long ago,\" replied Naab. \"Here, sight along my finger, and narrow your  eyes down.\"    \"I believe I see it--yes, I'm sure.\"    \"Good. How about you, Mescal?\"    \"Yes,\" she replied.    Jack was amused, for Dave insisted that he had been next to the Indian,  and Billy claimed priority to all of them. To these men bred on the  desert keen sight was preeminently the chief of gifts.    \"Jack, look sharp!\" said August. \"Peon is blanketing his fire. See the  flicker? One, two--one, two--one. Now for the answer.\"    Jack peered out into the shadowy space, star-studded above, ebony below.  Far across the depths shone a pinpoint of steady light. The Indian  grunted again, August vented his \"ha!\" and then Jack saw the light blink  like a star, go out for a second, and blink again.    \"That's what I like to see,\" said August. \"We're answered. Now all's  over but the work.\"    Work it certainly was, as Jack discovered next day. He helped the  brothers cut down cedars while August hauled them into line with his  roan. What with this labor and the necessary camp duties nearly a week  passed, and in the mean time Black Bolly recovered from her lameness.    Twice the workers saw Silvermane standing on open high ridges, restive  and suspicious, with his silver mane flying, and his head turned over  his shoulder, watching, always watching.    \"It'd be worth something to find out how long that stallion could go  without water,\" commented Dave. \"But we'll make his tongue hang out to-  morrow. It'd serve him right to break him with Black Bolly.\"    Daylight came warm and misty; veils unrolled from the desert; a purple  curtain lifted from the eastern crags; then the red sun burned.    Dave and Billy Naab mounted their mustangs, and each led another mount  by a halter.    \"We'll go to the ridge, cut Silvermane out of his band and warm him up;  then we'll drive him down to this end.\"    Hare, in his eagerness, found the time very tedious while August delayed  about camp, punching new holes in his saddle-girth, shortening his  stirrups, and smoothing kinks out of his lasso. At last he saddled the  roan, and also Black Bolly. Mescal came out of her tent ready for the  chase; she wore a short skirt of buckskin, and leggings of the same  material. Her hair, braided, and fastened at the back, was bound by a  double band closely fitting her black head. Hare walked, leading two  mustangs by the halters, and Naab and Mescal rode, each of them followed  by two other spare mounts. August tied three mustangs at one point along  the level stretch, and three at another. Then he led Mescal and Jack to  the top of the stone wall above the corral, where they had good view of  a considerable part of the plateau.    The eastern rise of ground, a sage and juniper slope, was in plain  sight. Hare saw a white flash; then Silvermane broke out of the cedars  into the sage. One of the brothers raced him half the length of the  slope, and then the other coming out headed him off down toward the  forest. Soon the pounding of hoofs sounded through the trees nearer and  nearer. Silvermane came out straight ahead on the open level. He was  running easily.    \"He hasn't opened up yet,\" said August.    Hare watched the stallion with sheer fascination; He ran seemingly  without effort. What a stride he had. How beautifully his silver mane  waved in the wind! He veered off to the left, out of sight in the brush,  while Dave and Billy galloped up to the spot where August had tied the  first three mustangs. Here they dismounted, changed saddles to fresh  horses, and were off again.    The chase now was close and all down-hill for the watchers. Silvermane  twinkled in and out among the cedars, and suddenly stopped short on the  rim. He wheeled and coursed away toward the crags, and vanished. But  soon he reappeared, for Billy had cut across and faced him about. Again  he struck the level stretch. Dave was there in front of him. He shot  away to the left, and flashed through the glades beyond. The brothers  saved their steeds, content to keep him cornered in that end of the  plateau. Then August spurred his roan into the scene of action.  Silvermane came out on the one piece of rising ground beyond the level,  and stood looking backward toward the brothers. When the great roan  crashed through the thickets into his sight he leaped as if he had been  stung, and plunged away.    The Naabs had hemmed him in a triangle, Dave and Billy at the broad end,  August at the apex, and now the real race began. August chased him up  and down, along the rim, across to the long line of cedars, always in  the end heading him for the open stretch. Down this he fled with flying  mane, only to be checked by the relentless brothers. To cover this broad  end of the open required riding the like of which Hare had never dreamed  of. The brothers, taking advantage of the brief periods when the  stallion was going toward August, changed their tired mustangs for fresh  ones.    \"Ho! Mescal!\" rolled out August's voice. That was the call for Mescal to  put Black Bolly after Silvermane. Her fleetness made the other mustangs  seem slow. All in a flash she was round the corral, with Silvermane  between her and the long fence of cedars. Uttering a piercing snort of  terror the gray stallion lunged out, for the first time panic-stricken,  and lengthened his stride in a wonderful way. He raced down the stretch  with his head over his shoulder watching the little black. Seeing her  gaining, he burst into desperate headlong flight. He saved nothing; he  had found his match; he won that first race down the level but it had  cost him his best. If he had been fresh he might have left Black Bolly  far behind, but now he could not elude her.    August Naab let him run this time, and Silvermane, keeping close to the  fence, passed the gate, ran down to the rim, and wheeled. The black  mustang was on him again, holding him in close to the fence, driving him  back down the stretch.    The brothers remorselessly turned him,"]]]
