Planchet had just done the same when an  unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse, which sank down.    \"Hey! your honor!\" cried Planchet, \"I've a man behind me.\"    D'Artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchet's  horse.    \"'Tis then the devil that pursues!\" he cried; drawing his sword and  preparing to attack the new foe.    \"No, no, dear D'Artagnan,\" said the figure, \"'tis not the devil, 'tis  Aramis; gallop fast, Planchet, and when you come to the end of the  village turn swiftly to the left.\"    And Planchet, with Aramis behind him, set off at full gallop, followed  by D'Artagnan, who began to think he was in the merry maze of some  fantastic dream.          9. The Abbe D'Herblay.      At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience  to the orders of Aramis, and stopped underneath the window which had  light in it. Aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times.  Immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from  it.    \"My friend,\" said Aramis, \"if you like to ascend I shall be delighted to  receive you.\"    \"Ah,\" said D'Artagnan, \"is that the way you return to your apartment?\"    \"After nine at night, pardieu!\" said Aramis, \"the rule of the convent is  very severe.\"    \"Pardon me, my dear friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I think you said  'pardieu!'\"    \"Do you think so?\" said Aramis, smiling; \"it is possible. You have no  idea, my dear fellow, how one acquires bad habits in these cursed  convents, or what evil ways all these men of the church have, with whom  I am obliged to live. But will you not go up?\"    \"Pass on before me, I beg of you.\"    \"As the late cardinal used to say to the late king, 'only to show you  the way, sire.'\" And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the  window in an instant.    D'Artagnan followed, but less nimbly, showing plainly that this mode of  ascent was not one to which he was accustomed.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Aramis, noticing his awkwardness; \"if I had  known that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured  the gardener's ladder; but for me alone this is good enough.\"    \"Sir,\" said Planchet when he saw D'Artagnan on the summit of the ladder,  \"this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you; in case of  necessity I might also climb up, but my two horses cannot mount the  ladder.\"    \"Take them to yonder shed, my friend,\" said Aramis, pointing to a low  building on the plain; \"there you will find hay and straw for them; then  come back here and clap your hands three times, and we will give you  wine and food. Marry, forsooth, people don't die of hunger here.\"    And Aramis, drawing in the ladder, closed the window. D'Artagnan then  looked around attentively.    Never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more  elegant. At each corner were arranged trophies, presenting to view  swords of all sorts, and on the walls hung four great pictures  representing in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de  Lorraine, the Cardinal de Richelieu, the Cardinal de la Valette, and the  Archbishop of Bordeaux. Exteriorly, nothing in the room showed that it  was the habitation of an abbe. The hangings were of damask, the carpets  from Alencon, and the bed, especially, had more the look of a fine  lady's couch, with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered  counterpane, than that of a man who had made a vow that he would  endeavor to gain Heaven by fasting and mortification.    \"You are examining my den,\" said Aramis. \"Ah, my dear fellow, excuse me;  I am lodged like a Chartreux. But what are you looking for?\"    \"I am looking for the person who let down the ladder. I see no one and  yet the ladder didn't come down of itself.\"    \"No, it is Bazin.\"    \"Ah! ah!\" said D'Artagnan.    \"But,\" continued Aramis, \"Bazin is a well trained servant, and seeing  that I was not alone he discreetly retired. Sit down, my dear friend,  and let us talk.\" And Aramis pushed forward a large easy-chair, in which  D'Artagnan stretched himself out.    \"In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?\" asked Aramis.    \"Yes, if you really wish it,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and even with great  pleasure, I confess; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite.\"    \"Ah, my poor friend!\" said Aramis, \"you will find meagre fare; you were  not expected.\"    \"Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur?\"    \"Oh, let us hope,\" said Aramis, \"that with the help of God and of Bazin  we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy  Jesuit fathers. Bazin, my friend, come here.\"    The door opened and Bazin entered; on perceiving the musketeer he  uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair.    \"My dear Bazin,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I am delighted to see with what  wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church!\"    \"Sir,\" replied Bazin, \"I have been taught by the good Jesuit fathers  that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good  cause.\"    \"So far well,\" said Aramis; \"we are dying of hunger. Serve us up the  best supper you can, and especially give us some good wine.\"    Bazin bowed low, sighed, and left the room.    \"Now we are alone, dear Aramis,\" said D'Artagnan, \"tell me how the devil  you managed to alight upon the back of Planchet's horse.\"    \"I'faith!\" answered Aramis, \"as you see, from Heaven.\"    \"From Heaven,\" replied D'Artagnan, shaking his head; \"you have no more  the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there.\"    \"My friend,\" said Aramis, with a look of imbecility on his face which  D'Artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers, \"if I did  not come from Heaven, at least I was leaving Paradise, which is almost  the same.\"    \"Here, then, is a puzzle for the learned,\" observed D'Artagnan, \"until  now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise;  some place it on Mount Ararat, others between the rivers Tigris and  Euphrates; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it,  while it was actually very near. Paradise is at Noisy le Sec, upon the  site of the archbishop's chateau. People do not go out from it by the  door, but by the window; one doesn't descend here by the marble steps of  a peristyle, but by the branches of a lime-tree; and the angel with a  flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his  celestial name of Gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the  Prince de Marsillac.\"    Aramis burst into a fit of laughter.    \"You were always a merry companion, my dear D'Artagnan,\" he said, \"and  your witty Gascon fancy has not deserted you. Yes, there is something in  what you say; nevertheless, do not believe that it is Madame de  Longueville with whom I am in love.\"    \"A plague on't! I shall not do so. After having been so long in love  with Madame de Chevreuse, you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of  her mortal enemy!\"    \"Yes,\" replied Aramis, with an absent air; \"yes, that poor duchess! I  once loved her much, and to do her justice, she was very useful to us.  Eventually she was obliged to leave France. He was a relentless enemy,  that damned cardinal,\" continued Aramis, glancing at the portrait of the  old minister. \"He had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut  off her head had she not escaped with her waiting-maid--poor Kitty! I  have heard that she met with a strange adventure in I don't know what  village, with I don't know what cure, of whom she asked hospitality and  who, having but one chamber, and taking her for a cavalier, offered to  share it with her. For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man,  that dear Marie; I know only one other woman who can do it as well. So  they made this song about her: 'Laboissiere, dis moi.' You know it,  don't you?\"    \"No, sing it, please.\"    Aramis immediately complied, and sang the song in a very lively manner.    \"Bravo!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"you sing charmingly, dear Aramis. I do not  perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice.\"    \"My dear D'Artagnan,\" replied Aramis, \"you understand, when I was a  musketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could; now when I am an abbe I  say as few masses as I can. But to return to our duchess.\"    \"Which--the Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville?\"    \"Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the  Duchess de Longueville? Little flirtations, perhaps, and that's all. No,  I spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse; did you see her after her return  from Brussels, after the king's death?\"    \"Yes, she is still beautiful.\"    \"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"I saw her also at that time. I gave her good  advice, by which she did not profit. I ventured to tell her that Mazarin  was the lover of Anne of Austria. She wouldn't believe me, saying that  she knew Anne of Austria, who was too proud to love such a worthless  coxcomb. After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of  Beaufort; and the 'coxcomb' arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de  Chevreuse.\"    \"You know,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"that she has had leave to return to  France?\"    \"Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or  another.\"    \"Oh, but this time perhaps she will follow your advice.\"    \"Oh, this time,\" returned Aramis, \"I haven't seen her; she is much  changed.\"    \"In that respect unlike you, my dear Aramis, for you are still the same;  you have still your beautiful dark hair, still your elegant figure,  still your feminine hands, which are admirably suited to a prelate.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Aramis, \"I am extremely careful of my appearance. Do you  know that I am growing old? I am nearly thirty-seven.\"    \"Mind, Aramis\"--D'Artagnan smiled as he spoke--\"since we are together  again, let us agree on one point: what age shall we be in future?\"    \"How?\"    \"Formerly I was your junior by two or three years, and if I am not  mistaken "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12590"],[0,"The Shadow of the Rope (#16)"],[1," family; and  all this was the more wonderful as a triumph of art over some natural  disadvantages in the way of soil and climate. The Normanthorpe roses,  famous throughout the north of England, were as yet barely budding in  the kindless wind; the blaze of early bulbs was over; but there were the  curious alien trees, and the ornamental waters haunted by outlandish  wildfowl, bred there on the same principle of acclimatization.    \"I expect you know the way quite well,\" said Rachel, as they followed a  winding path over a bank of rhododendrons near the lake; \"to me every  stroll is still a voyage of exploration, and I shall be rather sorry  when I begin to know exactly what I am going to see next. Now, I have  never been this way before, and have no idea what is coming, so you must  tell me, if you know. What a funny scent! I seem to know it, too. Why,  what have they got here?\"    On the further side of the bank of rhododendrons the path had descended  into a sheltered hollow, screened altogether from the colder winds, and,  even in this temperate month of May, a very trap for the afternoon sun.  And in this hollow was a clump of attenuated trees, with drooping leaves  of a lacklustre hue, and a white bark peeling from the trunk; a pungent  aroma, more medicinal than sylvan, hung rather heavily over the  sequestered spot.    Rachel stood a moment with wide nostrils and round eyes; the look hardly  lasted longer, and she said no more, but she was aware that Morna had  made some answer to her question.    \"What did you say?\" inquired Rachel, turning politely to her visitor.    \"I said they were blue gums from Australia.\"    Rachel made no immediate comment; secretive she might have to be, but  to a deliberate pretence she would not stoop. So she did not even say,  \"Indeed!\" but merely, after a pause, \"You are something of a botanist  yourself, then, Mrs. Woodgate?\" For they had been talking of the gardens  and of their history as they walked.    \"I?\" laughed Morna. \"I only wish I was; but I happen to remember Mr.  Steel telling me that one day when we were here last summer.\"    Rachel opened her eyes again, and her lips with them; but instead of  speaking she went to the nearest gum-tree and picked a spray of the  lacklustre leaves. \"I like the smell of them,\" she said, as they went  on; and the little incident left no impression upon Morna's mind.    Yet presently she perceived that Mrs. Steel had some color after all--at  the moment Rachel happened to be smelling her gum-leaves--and that she  was altogether prettier than Morna had fancied hitherto. The fact was  that it was her first good look at Rachel, who had kept her back to the  light indoors, and had literally led the way along the narrow paths,  while her large hat had supplied a perpetual shadow of its own. It was a  pathetic habit, which had become second nature with Rachel during the  last six months; but now, for once, it was forgotten, and her face  raised unguardedly to the sun, which painted it in its true and sweet  colors, to Morna's surprise and real delight. The vicar's wife was one  of those healthy-hearted young women who are the first to admire their  own sex; she had very many friends among women, for whom marriage had  not damped an enthusiasm which she hid from no one but themselves; and  she was to be sufficiently enthusiastic about the thin but perfect oval  of Rachel's face, the soft, sweet hazel of her eyes, the impetuous upper  lip and the brave lower one, as she saw them now for an instant in the  afternoon sun.    Moreover, she was already interested in Rachel on her own account, and  not only as the wife of the mysterious Mr. Steel. There was an undoubted  air of mystery about her also; but that might only be derived from him,  and with all her reserve she could not conceal a sweet and sympathetic  self from one as like her in that essential as they were different in  all others. Not that the reserve was all on one side. Morna Woodgate had  her own secrets too. One of them, however, was extracted during their  stroll.    \"May I make a personal remark?\" asked Rachel, who had been admiring the  pale brown face of Morna in her turn, as they came slowly back to the  house across the lawns.    \"You frighten me,\" said Morna, laughing. \"But let me hear the worst.\"    \"It's the ribbon on your hat,\" went on Rachel. \"What pretty colors! Are  they your husband's school or college?\"    \"No,\" said Morna, blushing as she laughed again. \"No, they're my own  college colors.\"    Rachel stood still on the grass.    \"Have you really been at college?\" said she; but her tone was so  obviously one of envy that Morna, who was delightfully sensitive about  her learning, did not even think of the short answer which she sometimes  returned to the astonished queries of the intellectually vulgar, but  admitted the impeachment with another laugh.    \"Now, don't say you wouldn't have thought it of me,\" she added, \"and  don't say you would!\"    \"I am far too jealous to say anything at all,\" Rachel answered with a  flattering stare. \"And do you mean to tell me that you took a degree?\"    \"Of sorts,\" admitted Morna, whose spoken English was by no means  undefiled. But it turned out to have been a mathematical degree; and  when, under sympathetic pressure, Morna vouchsafed particulars, even  Rachel knew enough to appreciate the honors which the vicar's wife had  won. What was more difficult to understand was how so young a woman of  such distinguished attainments could be content to hide her light under  the bushel of a country vicarage; and Rachel could not resist some  expression of her wonderment on that point.    \"Did you do nothing with it all,\" she asked, \"before you married?\"    \"No,\" said Morna; \"you see, I got engaged in the middle of it, and the  week after the lists came out we were married.\"    \"What a career to have given up!\"    \"I would give it up again,\" said Morna, with a warmer blush; and Rachel  was left with a deeper envy.    \"I am afraid we shall have nothing in common,\" sighed Mrs. Steel, as  they neared the house. \"I have no education worthy the name.\"    Morna waxed all but indignant at the implication; she had a morbid  horror of being considered a \"blue-stocking,\" which she revealed with  much girlish naivete and unconscious simplicity of sentiment and praise.  She was not so narrow as all that; she had had enough of learning; she  had forgotten all that she had learnt; any dolt could be crammed to pass  examinations. On the contrary, she was quite sure they would have heaps  in common; for example, she was longing for some one to bicycle with;  her husband seldom had the time, and he did not care for her to go quite  alone in the country roads.    \"But I don't bicycle,\" said Mrs. Steel, shaking her head rather sadly.    \"Ah, I forgot! People who ride and drive never do.\" And it was Morna's  turn to sigh.    \"No, I should like it; but I have never tried.\"    \"I'll teach you!\" cried Morna at once. \"What fun it will be!\"    \"I should enjoy it, I know. But--\"    The sentence was abandoned--as was often the case in the subsequent  intercourse between Rachel Steel and Morna Woodgate. From the beginning,  Rachel was apt to be more off her guard with Morna than with any one  whom she had met during the last six months; and, from the beginning,  she was continually remembering and stopping herself in a manner that  would have irritated Morna in anybody else. But then--yet again, from  the beginning--these two were natural and immediate friends.    \"You must learn,\" urged Morna, when she had waited some time for the  sentence which had but begun. \"There are people who scorn it--or  pretend to--but I am sure you are not one. It may not be the finest  form of exercise, but wait till you fly down these hills with your feet  on the rests! And then you are so independent; no horses to consider, no  coachman to consult; only your own bones and your own self! The  independence alone--\"    \"May be the very thing for you, Mrs. Woodgate, but it wouldn't do for my  wife!\"    Mr. Steel had stolen a silent march upon them, on the soft, smooth  grass; and now he was taking off his straw hat to Morna, and smiling  with all urbanity as he held out his hand. But Morna had seen how his  wife started at the sound of his voice, and her greeting was a little  cool.    \"I meant the bicycling,\" he was quick enough to add; \"not the  independence, of course!\"    But there was something sinister in his smile, something quite sinister  and yet not unkindly, that vexed and puzzled Morna during the remainder  of her visit, which she cut somewhat short on perceiving that Mr. Steel  had apparently no intention of leaving them to their own devices after  tea. Morna, however, would have been still more puzzled, and her spirit  not less vexed, had she heard the first words between the newly married  couple after she had gone.    \"What's that you have got?\" asked Steel, as they turned back up the  drive, after seeing Morna to her woodland path. Rachel was still  carrying her spray of gum-leaves; he must have noticed it before, but  this was the first sign that he had done so. She said at once what it  was, and why she had pulled it from the tree.    \"It took me back to Victoria; and, you know, I was born there.\"    Steel looked narrowly at his wife, a hard gleam in his inscrutable eyes,  and yet a lurking sympathy too, nor was there anything but the latter in  the tone and tenor of his reply.    \"I don't forget,\" he said, \"and I think I can understand; but neither  must you forget that I offered to take you back there. So that's a sprig  of gum-tree, is it?\"    Rachel gave him a sudden glance, which for once he missed, being  absorbed in a curious examination of the leaves.    \"Did you never see one before?\" she asked.    \"A gum-tree?\" said Steel, without looking up, as he sniffed and  scrutinized. \"Never in all my life--to my knowledge!\"          CHAPTER XI    ANOTHER NEW"]]]
