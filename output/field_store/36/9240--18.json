Should any one among you take up arms against  another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice.  Thus did We exhort you in the Tablet sent down aforetime,(22) and We  admonish you once again to follow that which hath been revealed by Him Who  is the Almighty, the All-Wise. Should anyone seek refuge with you, extend  unto him your protection and betray him not. Thus doth the Pen of the Most  High counsel you, as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the  All-Informed.    183 Beware lest ye act as did the King of Islam(23) when We came unto him  at his bidding. His ministers pronounced judgement against Us with such  injustice that all creation lamented and the hearts of those who are nigh  unto God were consumed. The winds of self and passion move them as they  will, and We found them all bereft of constancy. They are, indeed, of  those that are far astray.    184 Rein in Thy pen, O Pen of the Ancient of Days, and leave them to  themselves, for they are immersed in their idle fancies. Make Thou mention  of the Queen, that she may turn with a pure heart unto the scene of  transcendent glory, may withhold not her eyes from gazing toward her Lord,  the Supreme Ordainer, and may become acquainted with that which hath been  revealed in the Books and Tablets by the Creator of all mankind, He  through Whom the sun hath been darkened and the moon eclipsed, and through  Whom the Call hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven.    185 Turn thou unto God and say: O my Sovereign Lord! I am but a vassal of  Thine, and Thou art, in truth, the King of kings. I have lifted my  suppliant hands unto the heaven of Thy grace and Thy bounties. Send down,  then, upon me from the clouds of Thy generosity that which will rid me of  all save Thee, and draw me nigh unto Thyself. I beseech Thee, O my Lord,  by Thy name, which Thou hast made the king of names and the manifestation  of Thyself to all who are in heaven and on earth, to rend asunder the  veils that have intervened between me and my recognition of the  Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation. Thou art,  verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Bounteous. Deprive me not,  O my Lord, of the fragrances of the Robe of Thy mercy in Thy days, and  write down for me that which Thou hast written down for Thy handmaidens  who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and have recognized Thee, and  set their hearts towards the horizon of Thy Cause. Thou art truly the Lord  of the worlds and of those who show mercy the Most Merciful. Assist me,  then, O my God, to remember Thee amongst Thy handmaidens, and to aid Thy  Cause in Thy lands. Accept, then, that which hath escaped me when the  light of Thy countenance shone forth. Thou, indeed, hast power over all  things. Glory be to Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of the  heavens and of the earth.          Nasiri'd-Din Shah      186 O King of the Earth! Hearken unto the call of this Vassal: Verily, I  am a Servant Who hath believed in God and in His signs, and have  sacrificed Myself in His path. Unto this bear witness the woes which now  beset Me, woes the like of which no man hath ever before sustained. My  Lord, the All-Knowing, testifieth to the truth of My words. I have  summoned the people unto none save God, thy Lord and the Lord of the  worlds, and have endured for love of Him such afflictions as the eye of  creation hath never beheld. To this testify those whom the veils of human  fancy have not deterred from turning unto the Most Sublime Vision, and,  beyond them, He with Whom is the knowledge of all things in the preserved  Tablet.    187 Whensoever the clouds of tribulation have rained down the darts of  affliction in the path of God, the Lord of all names, I have hastened to  meet them, as every fair-minded and discerning soul shall attest. How many  the nights which found the beasts of the field resting in their lairs, and  the birds of the air lying in their nests, while this Youth languished in  chains and fetters with none to aid or succour Him!    188 Call Thou to mind God's mercy unto Thee; how, when Thou wert  imprisoned with a number of other souls, He delivered Thee and aided Thee  with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, until the King sent Thee to  'Iraq after We had disclosed unto him that Thou wert not of the sowers of  sedition. Those who follow their corrupt desires and lay aside the fear of  God are indeed in grievous error. They that spread disorder in the land,  shed the blood of men, and wrongfully consume the substance of others--We,  verily, are clear of them, and We beseech God not to associate Us with  them, whether in this world or in the world to come, unless they should  repent unto Him. He, verily, is of those who show mercy the most merciful.    189 Whoso turneth towards God must distinguish himself from others by his  every deed, and follow that which hath been enjoined upon him in the Book.  Thus hath it been decreed in a lucid Tablet. Those, however, who cast  behind their backs the commandments of God, and follow the prompting of  their own desires, are, verily, in grievous error.    190 O King! I adjure thee by thy Lord, the All-Merciful, to look upon thy  servants with the glances of the eye of thy favour, and to treat them with  justice, that God may treat thee with mercy. Potent is thy Lord to do as  He pleaseth. The world, with all its abasement and glory, shall pass away,  and the kingdom will remain unto God, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing.    191 Say: He hath kindled the lamp of utterance, and feedeth it with the  oil of wisdom and understanding. Too high is thy Lord, the All-Merciful,  for aught in the universe to resist His Faith. He revealeth what He  pleaseth through the power of His sovereign might, and protecteth it with  a host of His well-favoured angels. He is supreme over His servants and  exerciseth undisputed dominion over His creation. He, verily, is the  All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    192 O King! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo,  the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the  knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One  Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And He bade Me lift up My voice between  earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what hath caused the tears  of every man of understanding to flow. The learning current amongst men I  studied not; their schools I entered not. Ask of the city wherein I dwelt,  that thou mayest be well assured that I am not of them who speak falsely.  This is but a leaf which the winds of the will of thy Lord, the Almighty,  the All-Praised, have stirred. Can it be still when the tempestuous winds  are blowing? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all Names and Attributes! They  move it as they list. The evanescent is as nothing before Him Who is the  Ever-Abiding. His all-compelling summons hath reached Me, and caused Me to  speak His praise amidst all people. I was indeed as one dead when His  behest was uttered. The hand of the will of thy Lord, the Compassionate,  the Merciful, transformed Me. Can anyone speak forth of his own accord  that for which all men, both high and low, will protest against him? Nay,  by Him Who taught the Pen the eternal mysteries, save him whom the grace  of the Almighty, the All-Powerful, hath strengthened.    193 The Pen of the Most High addresseth Me, saying: Fear not. Relate unto  His Majesty the Shah that which befell thee. His heart, verily, is between  the fingers of thy Lord, the God of Mercy, that haply the sun of justice  and bounty may shine forth above the horizon of his heart. Thus hath the  decree been irrevocably fixed by Him Who is the All-Wise.    194 Look upon this Youth, O King, with the eyes of justice; judge thou,  then, with truth concerning what hath befallen Him. Of a verity, God hath  made thee His shadow amongst men, and the sign of His power unto all that  dwell on earth. Judge thou between Us and them that have wronged Us  without proof and without an enlightening Book. They that surround thee  love thee for their own sakes, whereas this Youth loveth thee for thine  own sake, and hath had no desire except to draw thee nigh unto the seat of  grace, and to turn thee toward the right hand of justice. Thy Lord beareth  witness unto that which I declare.    195 O King! Wert thou to incline thine ear unto the shrill of the Pen of  Glory and the cooing of the Dove of Eternity which, on the branches of the  Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, uttereth praises to God, the  Maker of all names and Creator of earth and heaven, thou wouldst attain  unto a station from which thou wouldst behold in the world of being naught  save the effulgence of the Adored One, and wouldst regard thy sovereignty  as the most contemptible of thy possessions, abandoning it to whosoever  might desire it, and setting thy face toward the Horizon aglow with the  light of His countenance. Neither wouldst thou ever be willing to bear the  burden of dominion save for the purpose of helping thy Lord, the Exalted,  the Most High. Then would the Concourse on high bless thee. O how  excellent is this most sublime station, couldst thou ascend thereunto  through the power of a sovereignty recognized as derived from the Name of  God!    196 Amongst the people are those who allege that this Youth hath had no  purpose but to perpetuate His name, whilst others claim that He hath  sought for Himself the vanities of the world--this, notwithstanding that  never, throughout all My days, have I found a place of safety, be it to  the extent of a single foothold. At all times have I been immersed in an  ocean of tribulations, whose full measure none can fathom but God. He,  truly, is aware of what I say. How many the days in which My loved ones  have been sorely shaken by reason of My afflictions, and how many the  nights during which My kindred, fearing for My life, have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#16)"],[1,"up in rebellion and committed that which caused the denizens of Thy  Kingdom to lament. Then no sooner had he found his hopes shattered and had  perceived the odour of utter failure than he raised his voice and gave  tongue to that which caused Thy chosen ones, who are nigh unto Thee, and  the inmates of the pavilion of glory, to be lost in bewilderment.    Thou seest me, O my God, writhing in anguish upon the dust, like unto a  fish. Deliver me, have mercy upon me, O Thou Whose aid is invoked by all  men, O Thou within Whose grasp lie the reins of power over all men and  women. Whenever I ponder my grievous shortcomings and my great trespasses,  despair assaileth me from every direction, and whenever I pause to  meditate upon the ocean of Thy bounteousness and the heaven of Thy grace  and the day-star of Thy tender compassion, I inhale the fragrance of hope  diffused from right and left, from north and south, as if every created  thing imparteth unto me the joyous tidings that the clouds of the heaven  of Thy mercy will pour down their rain upon me. By Thy might, O Thou Who  art the Mainstay of the sincere ones and the Desire of them that enjoy  near access unto Thee! Thy manifold favours and blessings and the  revelations of Thy grace and loving-kindness have truly emboldened me.  How, otherwise, can utter nothingness magnify the Name of Him Who hath, by  a word, brought creation into being, and how can an evanescent creature  extol Him Who hath demonstrated that no description can ever express Him  and no word of praise magnify His glory? He hath from everlasting been  immeasurably exalted above the understanding of His creatures and  sanctified from the conceptions of His servants.    O Lord! Thou beholdest this lifeless one before Thy face; suffer him,  through Thy generosity and bountiful favour, not to be deprived of the  chalice of immortal life. And Thou seest this afflicted one standing  before Thy throne; turn him not away from the ocean of Thy healing. I  entreat Thee to enable me at all times and under all conditions to  remember Thee, to magnify Thy Name and to serve Thy Cause, though I am  well aware that whatever proceedeth from a servant cannot transcend the  limitations of his soul, nor beseem Thy Lordship, nor be worthy of the  court of Thy glory and Thy majesty.    Thy might beareth me witness! Were it not to celebrate Thy praise, my  tongue would be of no use to me, and were it not for the sake of rendering  service to Thee, my existence would avail me not. But for the pleasure of  beholding the splendours of Thy realm of glory, why should I cherish  sight? And but for the joy of giving ear to Thy most sweet voice, of what  use is hearing?    Alas! Alas! I know not, O my God, my Mainstay, my heart's Desire, whether  Thou hast ordained for me that which shall bring solace to mine eyes,  gladden my bosom and rejoice my heart, or whether Thine irrevocable  decree, O King of eternity and the sovereign Lord of all nations, will  debar me from presenting myself before Thy throne. I swear by Thy glory  and majesty and by Thy dominion and power, the darkness of my remoteness  from Thee hath destroyed me. What hath become of the light of Thy  nearness, O Desire of every understanding heart? The tormenting agony of  separation from Thee hath consumed me. Where is the effulgent light of Thy  reunion, O Well-Beloved of such as are wholly devoted to Thee?    Thou seest, O my God, what hath befallen me in Thy Path at the hand of  those who have denied Thy Truth, have violated Thy Covenant, cavilled at  Thy signs, rejected the blessings Thou didst vouchsafe, disbelieved the  verses Thou didst send down and have refused to acknowledge the testimony  Thou didst fulfil.    O Lord! The tongue of my tongue and the heart of my heart and the spirit  of my spirit and my outward and inmost beings bear witness to Thy unity  and Thy oneness, Thy power and Thine omnipotence, Thy grandeur and Thy  sovereignty, and attest Thy glory, loftiness and authority. I testify that  Thou art God and that there is none other God besides Thee. From  everlasting Thou hast been a treasure hidden from the sight and minds of  men and shalt continue to remain the same for ever and ever. The powers of  earth can never frustrate Thee, nor can the might of the nations alarm  Thee. Thou art the One Who hath unlocked the door of knowledge before the  faces of Thy servants that they may recognize Him Who is the Day-Star of  Thy Revelation, the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, the Heaven of Thy  manifestation and the Sun of Thy divine beauty. In Thy holy Books, in Thy  Scriptures and Thy Scrolls Thou hast promised all the peoples of the world  that Thou Thyself shalt appear and shalt remove the veils of glory from  Thy face, even as Thou didst announce in Thy words unto Thy Friend(37)  through Whom the Day-Star of Revelation shone brightly above the horizon  of Hijaz, and the dawning light of divine Truth shed its radiance among  all men, proclaiming: 'The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of  the worlds.'(38) And before Muhammad Thou didst impart this glad-tiding  unto Him Who conversed with Thee,(39) saying: 'Bring forth thy people from  the darkness into the light and remind them of the days of God.'(40)  Moreover Thou didst proclaim this truth unto the Spirit(41) and unto Thy  Prophets and Thy Messengers, whether of the remote or more recent past. If  all that which Thou hast sent down in glorification of this Most Great  Remembrance, this Great Announcement, were to stream forth from the  wellspring of Thy most august Pen, the inmates of the cities of knowledge  and understanding would be dumbfounded, except such as Thou wouldst  deliver through the potency of Thy might and wouldst protect as a token of  Thy bountiful favour and Thy grace. I bear witness that Thou hast in truth  fulfilled Thy pledge and hast made manifest the One Whose advent was  foretold by Thy Prophets, Thy chosen ones and by them that serve Thee. He  hath come from the heaven of glory and power, bearing the banners of Thy  signs and the standards of Thy testimonies. Through the potency of Thine  indomitable power and strength, He stood up before the faces of all men  and summoned all mankind to the summit of transcendent glory and unto the  all-highest Horizon, in such wise that neither the oppression of the  ecclesiastics nor the onslaught of the rulers was able to deter Him. He  arose with inflexible resolve and, unloosing His tongue, proclaimed in  ringing tones: 'He Who is the All-Bountiful is come, riding aloft on the  clouds. Advance, O people of the earth, with shining faces and radiant  hearts!'    Great indeed is the blessedness of him who attaineth Thy presence,  drinketh the wine of reunion proffered by the hand of Thy bounteousness,  inhaleth the fragrance of Thy signs, unlooseth his tongue in celebrating  Thy praise, soareth high in Thy heavens, is carried away by the sweetness  of Thy Voice, gaineth admittance into the most exalted Paradise and  attaineth the station of revelation and vision before the throne of Thy  majesty.    I beg of Thee by the Most Great Infallibility which Thou hast chosen to be  the dayspring of Thy Revelation, and by Thy most sublime Word through  whose potency Thou didst call the creation into being and didst reveal Thy  Cause, and by this Name which hath caused all other names to groan aloud  and the limbs of the sages to quake, I beg of Thee to make me detached  from all else save Thee, in such wise that I may move not but in  conformity with the good-pleasure of Thy Will, and speak not except at the  bidding of Thy Purpose, and hear naught save the words of Thy praise and  Thy glorification.    I magnify Thy Name, O my God, and offer thanksgiving unto Thee, O my  Desire, inasmuch as Thou hast enabled me to clearly perceive Thy straight  Path, hast unveiled Thy Great Announcement before mine eyes and hast aided  me to set my face towards the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the  Fountainhead of Thy Cause, whilst Thy servants and Thy people turned away  from Thee. I entreat Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom of eternity, by the  shrill voice of the Pen of Glory, and by the Burning Fire which calleth  aloud from the verdant Tree, and by the Ark which Thou hast specially  chosen for the people of Baha, to grant that I may remain steadfast in my  love for Thee, be well pleased with whatsoever Thou hast prescribed for me  in Thy Book and may stand firm in Thy service and in the service of Thy  loved ones. Graciously assist then Thy servants, O my God, to do that  which will serve to exalt Thy Cause and will enable them to observe  whatsoever Thou hast revealed in Thy Book.    Verily Thou art the Lord of Strength, Thou art potent to ordain whatsoever  Thou willest and within Thy grasp Thou holdest the reins of all created  things. No God is there but Thee, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.    O Jalil! We have unveiled to thine eyes the sea and the waves thereof, the  sun and the radiance thereof, the heavens and the stars thereof, the  shells and the pearls thereof. Render thou thanks unto God for so great a  bounty, so gracious a favour that hath pervaded the whole world.    O thou who hast set thy face towards the splendours of My Countenance!  Vague fancies have encompassed the dwellers of the earth and debarred them  from turning towards the Horizon of Certitude, and its brightness, and its  manifestations and its lights. Vain imaginings have withheld them from Him  Who is the Self-Subsisting. They speak as prompted by their own caprices,  and understand not. Among them are those who have said: 'Have the verses  been sent down?' Say 'Yea, by Him Who is the Lord of the heavens!' 'Hath  the Hour come?' 'Nay, more; it hath passed, by Him Who is the Revealer of  clear tokens! Verily, the Inevitable is come, and He, the True One, hath  appeared with proof and testimony. The Plain is disclosed, and mankind is"]]]
