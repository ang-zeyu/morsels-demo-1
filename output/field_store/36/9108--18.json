In short,  the individuality of man, composed of his higher Manas, the sixth and  the seventh principle, should work as a unity, and then only can it  obtain \"divine wisdom,\" for divine things can be sensed only by divine  faculties.  Thus a chela should be actuated solely by a desire to  understand the operations of the Law of Cosmic Evolution, so as to be  able to work in conscious and harmonious accord with Nature.    --Anon.          The Brahmanical Thread      I.  The general term for the investiture of this thread is Upanayana;  and the invested is called Upanita, which signifies brought or drawn  near (to one's Guru), i.e., the thread is the symbol of the wearer's  condition.    II.  One of the names of this thread is Yajna-Sutra.  Yajna means  Brahma, or the Supreme Spirit, and Sutra the thread, or tie.  Collectively, the compound word signifies that which ties a man to his  spirit or god.  It consists of three yarns twisted into one thread, and  three of such threads formed and knotted into a circle.  Every  Theosophist knows what a circle signifies and it need not be repeated  here.  He will easily understand the rest and the relation they have to  mystic initiation.  The yarns signify the great principle of \"three in  one, and one in three,\" thus:--The first trinity consists of Atma which  comprises the three attributes of Manas, Buddhi, and Ahankara (the mind,  the intelligence, and the egotism).  The Manas again, has the three  qualities of Satva, Raja, and Tama (goodness, foulness, and darkness).  Buddhi has the three attributes of Pratyaksha, Upamiti and Anumiti  (perception, analogy, and inference). Ahankara also has three  attributes, viz., Jnata, Jneya, and Jnan (the knower, the known, and the  knowledge).    III.  Another name of the sacred thread is Tri-dandi.  Tri means three,  and Danda, chastisement, correction, or conquest.  This reminds the  holder of the three great \"corrections\" or conquests he has to  accomplish.  These are:--(1) the Vakya Sanyama;*  (2) the Manas Sanyama;  and (3) the Indriya (or Deha) Sanyama. Vakya is speech, Manas, mind, and  Deha (literally, body) or Indriya, is the senses.  The three conquests  therefore mean the control over one's speech, thought, and action.    --------  * Danda and Sanyama are synonymous terms.--A.S.  ---------    This thread is also the reminder to the man of his secular duties,  and its material varies, in consequence, according to the occupation  of the wearer.  Thus, while the thread of the Brahmans is made of  pure cotton, that of the Kshatriyas (the warriors) is composed of  flax--the bow-string material;  and that of Vaishyas (the traders and  cattle-breeders), of wool.  From this it is not to be inferred that caste  was originally meant to be hereditary. In the ancient times, it depended  on the qualities of the man. Irrespective of the caste of his parents, a  man could, according to his merit or otherwise, raise or lower himself  from one caste to another;  and instances are not wanting in which a man  has elevated himself to the position of the highest Brahman (such as  Vishvamitra Rishi, Parasara, Vyasa, Satyakam, and others) from the very  lowest of the four castes.  The sayings of Yudhishthira on this subject,  in reply to the questions of the great serpent, in the Arannya Parva of  the Maha-Bharata, and of Manu, on the same point, are well known and  need nothing more than bare reference.  Both Manu and Maha-Bharata--the  fulcrums of Hinduism--distinctly affirm that a man can translate  himself from one caste to another by his merit, irrespective of his  parentage.    The day is fast approaching when the so-called Brahmans will have to  show cause, before the tribunal of the Aryan Rishis, why they should not  be divested of the thread which they do not at all deserve, but are  degrading by misuse.  Then alone will the people appreciate the  privilege of wearing it.    There are many examples of the highest distinctive insignia being worn  by the unworthy.  The aristocracies of Europe and Asia teem with such.    --A. Sarman          Reading in a Sealed Envelope      Some years ago, a Brahman astrologer named Vencata Narasimla Josi, a  native of the village of Periasamudram in the Mysore Provinces, came to  the little town in the Bellary District where I was then employed.  He  was a good Sanskrit, Telugu and Canarese poet, and an excellent master  of Vedic rituals;  knew the Hindu system of astronomy, and professed to  be an astrologer.  Besides all this, he possessed the power of reading  what was contained in any sealed envelope.  The process adopted for this  purpose was simply this:--We wrote whatever we chose on a piece of  paper; enclosed it in one, two or three envelopes, each properly gummed  and sealed, and handed the cover to the astrologer.  He asked us to name  a figure between 1 and 9, and on its being named, he retired with the  envelope to some secluded place for some time; and then he returned with  a paper full of figures, and another paper containing a copy of what was  on the sealed paper--exactly, letter for letter and word for word.  I  tried him often and many others did the same;  and we were all satisfied  that he was invariably accurate, and that there was no deception  whatsoever in the matter.    About this time, one Mr. Theyagaraja Mudalyar, a supervisor in the  Public Works Department, an English scholar and a good Sanskrit and  Telugu poet, arrived at our place on his periodical tour of inspection.  Having heard about the aforesaid astrologer, he wanted to test him in a  manner, most satisfactory to himself. One morning handing to the  astrologer a very indifferently gummed envelope, he said, \"Here, Sir,  take this letter home with you and come back to me with your copy in the  afternoon.\"  This loose way of closing the envelope, and the permission  given to the astrologer to take it home for several hours, surprised the  Brahman, who said, \"I don't want to go home.  Seal the cover better, and  give me the use of some room here.  I shall be ready with my copy very  soon.\"  \"No,\" said the Mudalyar, \"take it as it is, and come back  whenever you like.  I have the means of finding out the deception, if  any be practiced.\"    So then the astrologer went with the envelope;  and returned to the  Mudalyar's place in the afternoon.  Myself and about twenty others were  present there by appointment.  The astrologer then carefully handed the  cover to the Mudalyar, desiring him to see if it was all right.  \"Don't  mind that,\" the Mudalyar answered; \"I can find out the trick, if there  be any.  Produce your copy.\" The astrologer thereupon presented to the  Mudalyar a paper on which four lines were written and stated that this  was a copy of the paper enclosed in the Mudalyar's envelope.  Those four  lines formed a portion of an antiquated poem.    The Mudalyar read the paper once, then read it over again. Extreme  satisfaction beamed over his countenance, and he sat mute for some  seconds seemingly in utter astonishment.  But soon after, the expression  of his face changing, he opened the envelope and threw the enclosure  down, jocularly saying to the astrologer, \"Here, Sir, is the original of  which you have produced the copy.\"    The paper lay upon the carpet, and was quite blank! not a word, nor a  letter on its clean surface.    This was a sad disappointment to all his admirers;  but to the  astrologer himself, it was a real thunderbolt.  He picked up the paper  pensively, examined it on both sides, then dashed it on the ground in a  fury;  and suddenly arising, exclaimed, \"My Vidya* is a delusion, and I  am a liar!\"    ---------  * Secret knowledge, magic.  ---------    The subsequent behaviour of the poor man made us fear lest this great  disappointment should drive him to commit some desperate act.  In fact  he seemed determined to drown himself in the well, saying that he was  dishonoured.  While we were trying to console him, the Mudalyar came  forward, caught hold of his hands, and besought him to sit down and  calmly listen to his explanation, assuring him that he was not a liar,  and that his copy was perfectly accurate.  But the astrologer would not  be satisfied; he supposed that all this was said simply to console him;  and cursed himself and his fate most horribly.  However, in a few  minutes he became calmer and listened to the Mudalyar's explanation,  which was in substance as follows The only way for the sceptic to  account for this phenomenon, is to suppose that the astrologer opened  the covers dexterously and read their contents.  \"So,\" he said, \"I wrote  four lines of old poetry on the paper with nitrate of silver, which  would be invisible until exposed to the light;  and this would have  disclosed the astrologer's fraud, if he had tried to find out the  contents of the enclosed paper, by opening the cover, however  ingeniously. For, if he opened it and looked at the paper, he would have  seen that it was blank, resealed the cover, and declared that the paper  enveloped therein bore no writing whatever;  or if he had, by design or  accident, exposed the paper to light, the writing would have become  black;  and he would have produced a copy of it as if it were the result  of his own Vidya;  but in either case and the writing remaining, his  deception would have been clear, and it would have been patent to all  that he did open the envelope.  But in the present case, the result  proved conclusively that the cover was not opened at all.\"    --P."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14392"],[0,"George Du Maurier, the Satirist of the Victorians (#16)"],[1," but he worked really hard, he  confessed, for one year. He made a number of friends, but of his  comrades at that school only one distinguished himself in after life,  Louis Becque de Fouquiere, the writer, whose life has been written by M.  Anatole France.    The artist went up for his _bachot_, his baccalaureate degree, at the  Sorbonne, and was plucked for his written Latin version. It vexed him  and his mother, for they were poor at the time, and it was important  that he should do well. His father was then in England. Du Maurier  crossed to him before informing him of his failure, miserable with the  communication he had to make. They met at the landing at London Bridge,  and at the sight of his utterly woebegone face, guessing the truth, his  father burst into a roar of laughter, which, said the son afterwards,  gave him the greatest pleasure he ever experienced.    His father was scientific, and hated everything that was not science. Du  Maurier, with his enthusiasm for Byron, had to meet this attitude as  best he could. His father never reproached him for the failure in the  _bachot_ examination. He had made up his mind that his son was intended  for a scientist, and determined to make him one, putting him as a pupil  at the Birkbeck Chemical Laboratory of University College, where he  studied chemistry under Dr. Williamson. The son's own ambition at that  time was to go in for music and singing. \"My father,\" he said,  \"possessed the sweetest, most beautiful voice that I have ever heard;  and if he had taken up singing as a profession, would most certainly  have been the greatest singer of his time. In his youth he had studied  music at the Paris Conservatoire, but his family objected to his  following the profession, for they were Legitimists and strong  Catholics, and held the stage in that contempt that was usual at the  beginning of the last century.\"    The artist himself as a youth was crazy about music, and used to  practise his voice wherever and whenever he could. But his father  discouraged him. The father died in his arms, singing one of Count de  Segur's songs.    He remained at the Birkbeck Laboratory for two years, leaving there in  1854, when his parent, still convinced of the future before his son in  the pursuit of science, set him up on his own account in a chemical  laboratory in Barge Yard, Bucklersbury, in the City. The house is still  standing. \"It was,\" says du Maurier, \"a fine laboratory, for my father,  being a poor man, naturally fitted it up in the most expensive style.\"  \"The only occasion,\" he continues, \"on which the sage of Barge Yard was  able to render any real service to humanity was when he was engaged by  the directors of a Company for working certain gold mines in Devonshire  which were being greatly boomed, and to which the public was subscribing  heavily, to go down to Devonshire to assay the ore. I fancy they  expected me to send them a report likely to further tempt the public. If  this was their expectation, they were mistaken, for after a few  experiments I went back to town and told them that there was not a  vestige of gold in the ore. The directors were of course very  dissatisfied with this statement, and insisted on my returning to  Devonshire to make further investigation. I went and had a good time of  it down in the country, for the miners were very jolly fellows; but I  was unable to satisfy my employers, and sent up a report which showed  the public that the whole thing was a swindle, and so saved a good many  people from loss.\"    [Illustration: Queen Prima-Donna at Home         _Chorus_. \"O, Mamma!--_Dear_ Mamma!--_Darling_ Mamma!! _Do_ leave       off!!!\"         (Showing that no one is a prophet in his own country.)    _Punch_, November 7, 1874.]    Du Maurier told the story of this business in _Once a Week_ in  1861; it is written in a highly amusing strain.    We have taken relevant extracts, as follows, from the amusing story,  partly because it exhibits the artist for the first time as an Author,  and partly because it continues the narrative of his life:--      Section 3    \"Somebody who took a great interest in me (my father) had just  established me in the City as an analytical chemist and mining engineer.  Now, if there was one thing in the world for which I was peculiarly, and  I may even say extraordinarily, unfit, it was that very useful  profession; but it is a well-known fact that the fondest parents are not  always the most discriminating in the choice of professions for their  sons. So I had spent two years in a school of chemistry, attending  lectures and performing analyses, qualitative and quantitative, and  various other chemical experiments, which I used to think very droll and  amusing, in order to fit myself for my future career, and at length,  thanks to my father's kindness, I found myself master of a laboratory  which had been arranged in a manner regardless of expense, with water  and gas laid on in every possible corner, and bottles, chemical stoves,  and scales, &c., of a most ornamental brightness and perfection.    \"Here I waited for employment daily, and entertained my friends with  sumptuous hospitality at lunch and supper; here also I occasionally  astonished my mother and sister by dexterously turning yellow liquids  into blue ones, and performing other marvels of science--accomplishments  which I have almost entirely forgotten (in my prospectus it was stated  that assays of ore and analyses of minerals, &c., would be most  carefully conducted, and all business of the kind attended to, with  great steadiness and despatch); and pending the advent of work, the  scene of my future operations was enlivened by athletic sport and every  kind of jollification, which helped me to endure the anxiety of my  parents at seeing me start on the serious business of life so young.\" He  goes on to say that, thanks to kindness of friends of his family,  employment came: he was given an order for analysing various specimens  of soil from a friend's estate. \"I conducted these experiments with  proper earnestness, and he paid me for them with becoming gravity. I  now thank him kindly for the same (it would have been undignified to do  so then) and sincerely hope that he has found my scientific research  beneficial to his land.\" Then the gold contagion suddenly broke out and  committed great ravages. \"I caught it one rainy afternoon near the  Exchange; my mother and sister instantly became affected, but my father,  who was of a stout habit and robust temperament, and gifted with a very  practical turn of mind, fortunately escaped, and devoted himself to our  cure. Thanks to his judicious nursing, I was the first to recover.\" \"The  gold fever raged worse and worse, and I waited impatiently for it to  give me employment; at length it did so, in a few months from the period  of its birth: somebody introduced me to somebody else, who introduced me  to the chairman of the Victoria Gold and Copper Mine, situated near  Moleville, in Blankshire.\"    Then follows an interview with the directors. \"It was necessary that in  my interview with the directors next day, I should cram them with every  possible technical term that had ever been invented for the purpose.\"    He manages to squeeze \"lodes,\" \"gossans,\" \"costeanings,\" and other  impressive words into almost every sentence. It produces a great effect  on the directors.    The offer of a guinea and a half a day to go down the mine inspires a  wild impulse to embrace the whole board in the person of the venerable  fat old fellow who makes the offer. This is restrained. \"I told him I  would think of the matter, and return him an answer the following day;  and, after bouncing myself first into the office-clerk and then into the  fire-place, I eventually succeeded in making an unconcerned exit.\"    \"I pass over my triumphant sensations and the family bliss, only  chequered by anxiety lest the Victoria Gold and Copper Mine should come  to grief before I got there.\"    He then travels through enchanting scenery, and is conducted to the  mine. \"Some five and twenty or thirty shaggy rough-looking men were  about. These were the miners. Their appearance was not reassuring, and  when the engineer left me alone with them, with a parting injunction  that I was to make them feel I had an iron will at once, I confess I  felt myself uncomfortably young, and a little bit at a loss.    \"We proceeded to business at once, however; and as I met their first  little symptoms of insubordination with one or two acts of summary  justice (which I will spare the reader, but which, emanating from me,  caused me unlimited astonishment), I soon established a proper authority  over them, and we thenceforward got on together capitally.\"    We are then given extracts from a mining diary--significantly left off  at a particular stage of the proceedings--used as a sketch-book. An  unfavourable report as to the finding of gold is sent in to the board.    \"The miners did not believe in the mine, and as they perceived that I  did not either, they believed in me to a most flattering extent.\" He  soon got very much attached to the miners, and used to tell stories  about foreign lands while they were distilling the pure mercury, or  performing other innocent operations suggested by the board,  enlightening them on various subjects where he felt their ignorance to  be equal to his own. \"My letters home contained descriptions and  sketches of them, and my mamma became interested in their spiritual  welfare.\" Surrounded by the halo of memory, they afterwards seemed to  him primitive gentlemen worthy of King Arthur's Round Table. He  describes existence between the hours of work as full of charm owing to  the friendship of surrounding farmers and small gentry. In a \"Trilby\"  way he describes how he \"rode, and wrestled, and boxed with them! and  fell in love with their sisters, and sketched them, and sang Tyrolese  melodies to them, .."]]]
