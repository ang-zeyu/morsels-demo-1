On another chariot, drawn by an elephant, came Osiris, as he returned  from his Indian conquests. He was followed by twenty-four chariots drawn  by elephants, sixty drawn by goats, twelve by some kind of stags,  seven by gazelles, four by wild asses, fifteen by buffaloes, eight by  ostriches, and seven by stags of some other kind. Then came chariots  loaded with the tributes of the conquered nations; men of Ethiopia  carrying six hundred elephants' teeth; sixty huntsmen leading two  thousand four hundred dogs; and one hundred and fifty men carrying  trees, in the branches of which were tied parrots and other beautiful  birds. Next walked the foreign animals, Ethiopian and Arabian sheep,  Brahmin bulls, a white bear, leopards, panthers, bears, a camelopard,  and a rhinoceros; proving to the wondering crowd the variety and  strangeness of the countries that owned their monarch's sway.    In another chariot was seen Bacchus running away from Juno, and flying  to the altar of Rhea. After that came the statues of Alexander and  Ptolemy Soter crowned with gold and ivy: by the side of Ptolemy stood  the statues of Virtue, of the god Chem, and of the city of Corinth;  and he was followed by female statues of the conquered cities of Ionia,  Greece, Asia Minor, and Persia; and the statues of other gods. Then came  crowds of singers and cymbal-players, and two thousand bulls with gilt  horns, crowns, and breast-plates. Then came Amon-Ra and other gods;  and the statue of Alexander between Victory and the goddess Neith, in a  chariot drawn by elephants: then a number of thrones of ivory and gold;  on one was a golden crown, on another a golden cornucopia, and on the  throne of Ptolemy Soter was a crown worth ten thousand _aurei_, or  nearly thirty thousand dollars; then three thousand two hundred golden  crowns, twenty golden shields, sixty-four suits of golden armour; and  the whole was closed with forty waggons of silver vessels, twenty  of golden vessels, eighty of costly Eastern scents, and fifty-seven  thousand six hundred foot soldiers, and twenty-three thousand two  hundred horse. The procession began moving by torchlight before day  broke in the morning, and the sun set in the evening before it had all  passed on its way.    [Illustration: 106.jpg BRONZE COSMETIC HOLDER]    It went through the streets of Alexandria to the royal tents on the  outside of the city, where, as in the procession, everything that was  costly in art, or scarce in nature, was brought together in honour of  the day. At the public games, as a kind of tax or coronation money,  twenty golden crowns were given to Ptolemy Soter, twenty-three to  Berenice, and twenty to their son, the new king, beside other costly  gifts; and two thousand two hundred and thirty-nine talents, or one  million seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, were spent on the  amusements of the day. For the account of this curious procession we are  indebted to Callixenes of Rhodes, who was then travelling in Egypt, and  who wrote a history of Alexandria.    Ptolemy Soter lived two years after he had withdrawn himself from the  cares of government; and the weight of his name was not without its  use in adding steadiness to the throne of his successor. Instead of  parcelling out his wide provinces among his sons as so many kingdoms, he  had given them all to one son, and that not the eldest; and on his death  the jealousy of those who had been disinherited and disappointed broke  out in rebellion.    It is with peculiar interest that we hear in this reign for the  first time that the bravery and rising power of the Romans had forced  themselves into the notice of Philadelphus. Pyrrhus, the King of Epirus,  had been beaten by the Romans, and driven out of Italy; and the King of  Egypt thought it not beneath him to send an ambassador to the senate, to  wish them joy of their success, and to make a treaty of peace with the  republic. The embassy, as we might suppose, was received in Rome with  great joy; and three ambassadors, two of the proud name of Fabius, with  Quintus Ogulnius, were sent back to seal the treaty. Philadelphus gave  them some costly gifts, probably those usually given to ambassadors;  but Rome was then young, her citizens had not yet made gold the end for  which they lived, and the ambassadors returned the gifts, for they could  receive nothing beyond the thanks of the senate for having done their  duty. This treaty was never broken; and in the war which broke out in  the middle of this reign between Rome and Carthage, usually called the  first Punic war, when the Carthaginians sent to Alexandria to beg for  a loan of two thousand talents, Philadelphus refused it, saying that he  would help them against his enemies, but not against his friends.    From that time forward we find Egypt in alliance with Rome. But we also  find that they were day by day changing place with one another: Egypt  soon began to sink, while Rome was rising in power; Egypt soon received  help from her stronger ally, and at last became a province of the Roman  empire.    At the time of this embassy, when Greek arts were nearly unknown to the  Romans, the ambassadors must have seen much that was new to them, and  much that was worth copying; and three years afterwards, when one of  them, Quintus Ogulnius, together with Caius Fabius Pictor, were chosen  consuls, they coined silver for the first time in Rome. With them begins  the series of consular denarii, which throws such light on Roman life  and history.    About the middle of this reign, Berenice, the mother of the king, died,  and it was most likely then that Philadelphus began to date from the  beginning of his own reign: he had before gone on like his father,  dating from the beginning of his father's reign. In the year after her  death, the great feast of Osiris, in the month of Mesore, was celebrated  at Alexandria with more than usual pomp by the Queen Arsinoe. Venus, or  Isis, had just raised Berenice to heaven; and Arsinoe, in return, showed  her gratitude by the sums of money spent on the feast of Osiris, or  Adonis as he was sometimes called by the Greeks. Theocritus, who was  there, wrote a poem on the day, and tells us of the crowds in the  streets, of the queen's gifts to the temple, and of the beautiful  tapestries, on which were woven the figures of the god and goddess  breathing as if alive; and he has given a free translation of the  Maneros, the national poem in which the priests each year consoled the  goddess Isis for the death of Osiris, which was sung through the streets  of Alexandria by a Greek girl in the procession. One of the chief  troubles in the reign of Philadelphus was the revolt of Cyrene. The  government of that part of Africa had been entrusted to Magas, the  half-brother of the king, a son of Berenice by her former husband.  Berenice, who had been successful in setting aside Ceraunus to make room  for her son Philadelphus on the throne of Egypt, has even been said to  have favoured the rebellious and ungrateful efforts of her elder son  Magas to make himself King of Cyrene. Magas, without waiting till the  large armies of Egypt were drawn together to crush his little state,  marched hastily towards Alexandria, in the hopes of being joined by  some of the restless thousands of that crowded city. But he was quickly  recalled to Cyrene by the news of the rising of the Marmaridas, the race  of Libyan herdsmen that had been driven back from the coast by the Greek  settlers who founded Cyrene. Philadelphus then led his army along the  coast against the rebels; but he was, in the same way, stopped by the  fear of treachery among his own Gallic mercenaries. With a measured  cruelty which the use of foreign mercenaries could alone have taught  him, he led back his army to the marshes of the Delta, and, entrapping  the four thousand distrusted Gauls* on one of the small islands, he  hemmed them in between the water and the spears of the phalanx, and they  all died miserably, by famine, by drowning, or by the sword.         * It is not known for certain from what part of the world       these Gauls were recruited. The race known as Gallic was at       one time spread over a wide district from Gallicia in the       East to Gallia in the West.    Magas had married Apime, the daughter of Antiochus Soter, King of Syria;  and he sent to his father-in-law to beg him to march upon Coele-Syria  and Palestine, to call off the army of Philadelphus from Cyrene. But  Philadelphus did not wait for this attack: his armies moved before  Antiochus was ready, and, by a successful inroad upon Syria, he  prevented any relief being sent to Magas.    After the war between the brothers had lasted some years, Magas made  an offer of peace, which was to be sealed by betrothing his only  child, Berenice, to the son of Philadelphus. To this offer Philadelphus  yielded; as by the death of Magas, who was already worn out by luxury  and disease, Cyrene would then fall to his own son. Magas, indeed, died  before the marriage took place; but, notwithstanding the efforts made  by his widow to break the agreement, the treaty was kept, and on this  marriage Cyrene again formed part of the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt.    The black spot upon the character of Philadelphus, which all the blaze  of science and letters by which he was surrounded can not make us  overlook, is the death of two of his brothers: a son of Eurydice, who  might, perhaps, have thought that he was robbed of the throne of Egypt  by his younger brother, and who was unsuccessful in raising the island  of Cyprus in rebellion; and a younger brother, Argasus, who was also  charged with joining in a plot; both lost their lives by his orders.    It was only in the beginning of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17331"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#16)"],[1,"nemies. It was not till the second generation of Gnostic teachers were  spreading their heresies that the Greek philosophers began to embrace  Christianity, or the Christians to study Greek literature; but as soon  as that was the case we have an unbroken chain of writings, in which  we find Christianity more or less mixed with the Alexandrian form of  platonism.    [Illustration: 106.jpg KOPTIC CHARM AND SCARABEUS]    The philosopher Justin, after those who had talked with the apostles,  is the earliest Christian writer whose works have reached us. He was a  Greek, born in Samaria; but he studied many years in Alexandria under  philosophers of all opinions. He did not, however, at once find in  the schools the wisdom he was in search for. The Stoic could teach him  nothing about God; the Peripatetic wished to be paid for his lessons  before he gave them; and the Pythagorean proposed to begin with music  and mathematics.    [Illustration: 107.jpg GNOSTIC GEM]    Not content with these, Justin turned to the platonist, whose purer  philosophy seemed to add wings to his thoughts, and taught him to mount  aloft towards true wisdom. While turning over in his mind what he had  thus learned in the several schools, dissatisfied with the philosopher's  views, he chanced one day to meet with an old man walking on the  seashore near Alexandria, to whom he unbosomed his thoughts, and by whom  he was converted to Christianity. Justin tells us that there were no  people, whether Greeks or barbarians, or even dwellers in tent and  waggons, among whom prayers were not offered up to the heavenly father  in the name of the crucified Jesus. The Christians met every Sunday for  public worship, which began with a reading from the prophets, or from  the memoirs of the apostles called the gospels. This was followed by  a sermon, a prayer, the bread and wine, and a second prayer. Justin's  quotations prove that he is speaking of the New Testament, which within  a hundred years of the crucifixion wras read in all the principal cities  in which Greek was spoken. Justin died as a martyr in 163 A.D.    The platonic professorship in Alexandria had usually been held by an  Athenian, and for a short time Athenagoras of Athens taught that branch  of philosophy in the museum; but he afterwards embraced the Christian  religion, and then taught Christianity openly in Alexandria. He enjoys  with Justin the honour of being one of the first men of learning who  were converted, and, like Justin, his chief work is an apology for the  Christians, addressed to the emperor, Marcus Aurelius.    [Illustration: 108.jpg GEMS SHOWING SYMBOL OF DEATH AND THE WORD [IAH]  JAVEH]    Athenagoras confines himself in his defence to the resurrection from  the dead and the unity of the Deity, the points chiefly attacked by the  pagans.    Hadrian's Egyptian coins are remarkable both for number and variety. In  the sixth year of the reign we see a ship with spread sails, most likely  in gratitude for the emperor's safe arrival in Egypt. In the eighth year  we see the head of the favourite Antinous, who had been placed among the  gods of the country. In the eleventh year, when the emperor took up the  tribunitial power at Rome for a second period of ten years, we find a  series of coins, each bearing the name of the nome or district in which  it was coined. This indeed is the most remarkable year of the most  remarkable reign in the whole history of coinage; we have numerous coins  for every year of this reign, and, in this year, for nearly every nome  in Egypt. Some coins are strongly marked with the favourite opinion of  the Gnostics as to the opposition between good and evil.    [Illustration: 109.jpg Hadrian's Egyptian coins]    On one we have the war between the serpent of good and the serpent of  evil, distinguished by their different forms and by the emblems of Isis  and Serapis; on others the heads of Isis and Serapis, the principles of  love and fear; while on a third these two are united into a trinity by  Horus, who is standing on an eagle instead of having an eagle's head, as  represented on previous coins.    The beginning of the reign of Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138) was remarkable  as being the end of the Sothic period of one thousand four hundred and  sixty years; the movable new year's day of the calendar had come round  to the place in the natural year from which it first began to move in  the reign of Menophres or Thutmosis III.; it had come round to the day  when the dog-star rose heliacally. If the years had been counted from  the beginning of this great year, there could have been no doubt when it  came to an end, as from the want of a leap year the new year's day  must have been always moving one day in four years; but no satisfactory  reckoning of the years had been kept, and, as the end of the period was  only known by observation, there was some little doubt about the exact  year. Indeed, among the Greek astronomers, Dositheus said the dog-star  rises heliacally twenty-three days after midsummer, Meton twenty-eight  days, and Euctemon thirty-one days; they thus left a doubt of thirty-two  years as to when the period should end, but the statesmen placed it in  the first year of the reign of Antoninus. This end of the Sothic period  Avas called the return to the phoenix, and had been looked forward to by  the Egyptians for many years, and is well marked on the coins of this  reign. The coins for the first eight years teem with astronomy. There  are several with the goddess Isis in a boat, which we know, from the  zodiac in the Memnonium at Thebes, was meant for the heliacal rising of  the dog-star. In the second and in the sixth year we find on the coins  the remarkable word aion, _the age_ or _period_, and an ibis with a  glory of rays round its head, meant for the bird phoenix. In the seventh  year we see Orpheus playing on his lyre while all the animals of the  forest are listening, thus pointing out the return of the golden age.  In the eighth year we have the head of Serapis circled by the seven  planets, and the whole within the twelve signs of the zodiac; and on  another coin we have the sun and moon within the signs of the zodiac. A  series of twelve coins for the same year tells us that the house of the  sun, in the language of the astrologers, is in the lion, that of the  moon in the crab, the houses of Venus in the scales and the bull, those  of Mars in the scorpion and the ram, those of Jupiter in the archer  and the fishes, those of Saturn in the sea-goat and aquarius, those of  Mercury in the virgin and the twins. On the coins of the same year we  have the eagle and thunderbolt, the sphinx, the bull Apis, the Nile and  crocodile, Isis nursing the child Horus, the hawk-headed Aroeris, and  the winged sun. On coins of other years we have a camelopard, Horus  sitting on the lotus-flower, and a sacrifice to Isis, which was  celebrated on the last day of the year.    The coins also tell us of the bountiful overflow of the Nile, and of  the goodness of the harvests that followed; thus, in the ninth, tenth,  thirteenth, and seventeenth years, we see the river Nile in the form  of an old man leaning on a crocodile, pouring corn and fruit out of a  cornucopia, while a child by his side, with the figures 36, tells  us that in those years the waters of the Nile rose at Memphis to the  wished-for height of sixteen cubits. From these latter coins it would  seem that but little change had taken place in the soil of the Delta by  the yearly deposit of mud; Herodotus says that sixteen cubits was the  wished-for rise of the Nile at Memphis when he was there. And we should  almost think that the seasons were more favourable to the husbandman  during the reign of an Antonine than of a Caligula, did we not set it  down to the canals being better cleansed by the care of the prefect, and  to the mildness of the government leaving the people at liberty to enjoy  the bounties of nature, and at the same time making them more grateful  in acknowledging them.    [Illustration: 112.jpg COINS OF ANTONINUS PIUS.]    The mystic emblems on the coins are only what we might look for from the  spread of the Gnostic opinions, and the eagerness with which the Greeks  were copying the superstitions of the Egyptians; and, while astrology  was thus countenanced by the state, of course it was not less followed  by the people. The poor Jews took to it as a trade. In Alexandria the  Jewess, half beggar, half fortune-teller, would stop people in the  streets and interpret dreams by the help of the Bible, or sit under a  sacred tree like a sibyl, and promise wealth to those who consulted her,  duly proportioned to the size of the coin by which she was paid. We find  among the Theban ruins pieces of papyrus with inscriptions, describing  the positions of the heavens at particular hours in this reign, for the  astrologers therewith to calculate the nativities of the persons then  born. On one is a complete horoscope, containing the places of the sun,  moon, and every planet, noted down on the zodiac in degrees and minutes  of a degree; and with these particulars the mathematician undertook to  foretell the marriage, fortune, and death of the person who had been  born at the instant when the heavenly bodies were so situated; and, as  the horoscope was buried in the tomb with the mummy, we must suppose  that it was thought that the prognostication would hold good even in the  next world.    But astrology was not the only end to which mathematics were then  turned. Claudius Ptolemy, the astronomer and geographer, was at that  time the ornament of the mathematical school of Alexandria. In his  writings he treats of the earth as the centre of the heavens, and the  sun, moon, and planets as moving in circles and epicycles round it. This  had been the opinion of some of the early astronomers; but since this  theory of the heavens received the stamp of his authority, it is now  always"]]]
