The result, on the whole, was not in favour  of Champlain's allies, who in the absence of the Andastes were not  anxious to continue the attacks against the Iroquois, and consequently  determined to retreat as soon as possible.    Champlain suffered much from his wounds. \"I never found myself in such a  gehenna,\" he says, \"as during this time, for the pain which I suffered  in consequence of the wound in my knee was nothing in comparison with  that which I endured while I was carried, bound and pinioned, on the  back of one of the savages.\"    The retreat was very long, and on October 18th they arrived at the shore  of Lake Ontario. Here Champlain requested that he might have a canoe and  guides to conduct him to Quebec, and this was one of the conditions to  which they had agreed before he set out for the war. The Indians were  not to be trusted, however, and they refused his request. Champlain,  therefore, resolved to accept the hospitality of Darontal, chief of the  Arendarrhonons, or tribe de la Roche. The chief appeared kindly disposed  towards Champlain, and as it was the hunting season, he accompanied him  on his excursions. During one of these expeditions, Champlain lost his  way in the pursuit of a strange bird, and he was not found by the  savages until three days afterwards. The return journey to Cahiague on  foot was painful, and during the nineteen days thus spent, much hardship  was undergone. The party arrived at Cahiague on December 23rd, 1615.    In the course of the winter, Champlain was chosen to act as judge of a  quarrel between the Algonquins of the Petite Nation, and the Hurons of  the tribe de l'Ours, which had arisen over the murder of one of the  Iroquois. The Attignaouantans had committed an Iroquois prisoner to the  custody of Iroquet, requesting him to burn him according to their  custom. Instead of carrying out this act, Iroquet had taken the young  man and treated him as a son. When the Attignaouantans were aware of  this, they sent one of their number to murder the young Iroquois. This  barbarous conduct made the Algonquins indignant, and they killed the  murderer.    Champlain returned from the Petuneux in company with Father Le Caron at  the time when these crimes had just been committed. Witnesses were  summoned to meet Champlain at Cahiague, and were each examined. The  trial lasted two days, during which the old men of both nations were  consulted, and the majority of them were favourable to a reconciliation  without conditions. Champlain exacted from them a promise that they  would accept his decision as final, and he then had a full meeting of  the two tribes assembled there. Addressing them, he said:    \"You Algonquins, and you Hurons, have always been friends. You have  lived like brothers; you take this name in your councils. Your conduct  now is unworthy of reasonable men. You are enough occupied in repelling  your enemies, who have pursued you, who rout you as often as possible,  pursuing you to your villages and taking you prisoners. These enemies,  seeing these divisions and wars among you, will be delighted and derive  great advantage therefrom. On account of the death of one man you will  hazard the lives of ten thousand, and run the risk of being reduced to  perpetual slavery. Although in fact one man was of great value, you  ought to consider how he has been killed; it was not with deliberate  purpose, nor for the sake of inciting a civil war. The Algonquins much  regret all that has taken place, and if they had supposed such a thing  would have happened, they would have sacrificed this Iroquois for the  satisfaction of the Hurons. Forget all, never think of it again, but  live good friends as before. In case you should not be pleased with my  advice, I request you to come in as large numbers as possible, to our  settlement, so that there, in presence of all the captains of vessels,  the friendship might be ratified anew, and measures taken to secure you  from your enemies.\"    Champlain's advice was followed, and the savages went away satisfied,  except the Algonquins, who broke up and proceeded to their villages,  saying that the death of these two men had cost them too dearly.    Champlain having spent the winter with Darontal, on May 20th left for  Quebec. The journey from Cahiague to Sault St. Louis occupied forty  days. Champlain here found that Pont-Grave had arrived from France with  two vessels, and that the reverend fathers were very pleased to see him  again. Darontal accompanied Champlain to Quebec, and greatly admired the  habitation and the mode of living adopted by the French. Before leaving  for France, Champlain enlarged the habitation by at least one-third, the  additions consisting of buildings and fortifications, in the  construction of which he used lime and sand which were found near at  hand. Some grain was also cut, and the gardens were left in good  condition.    During the winter of 1615-16, Father Le Caron had received a visit from  Champlain, who was then returning from an expedition against the  Iroquois. Being at a loss to know how to employ their time, Champlain  and the Recollets resolved to pay a visit to the Tionnontates, or people  of the Petun. The missionary was not well received by these people,  although Champlain was able to make an alliance, not only with the  Petuneux, but also with six or seven other tribes living in the  vicinity.    Father Le Caron returned to his flock, the Hurons, and remained with  them until May 20th, studying their manners, trying to acquire their  language, and to improve their morals. Father Le Clercq says that he  compiled a dictionary which was seen in his own time, and which was  preserved as a relic.    When the Hurons left their country to engage in fur trading with the  French at Sault St. Louis, Father Le Caron took passage in one of their  canoes, and arrived at Three Rivers on July 1st, 1616. Here he met  Father d'Olbeau, who had spent the winter with the Indians on the north  shore of the river St. Lawrence, between Tadousac and the Seven Islands.    Father d'Olbeau had visited the Bersiamites, the Papinachois and others,  and he planted crosses everywhere, so that many years after, when some  Frenchmen were visiting the place, they found these evidences of his  labours. After two months of fatigue, Father d'Olbeau was compelled to  return to Quebec, as he was suffering from sore eyes, and was unable to  unclose his eyelids for several weeks. The two fathers arrived at Quebec  on July 11th, 1616, and Father Jamet was pleased to learn the result of  the missions of his confreres. The three missionaries had carefully  studied the country during the past year, and gained a fair knowledge of  the people. They realized at this time that their own resources limited  their power of doing good, and they therefore requested Champlain to  convoke a meeting of six inhabitants, to discuss the best means of  furthering the interests of the mission. Champlain was chosen president  of the meeting, and although the missionaries were present they took no  part in the deliberations.    The resolutions adopted at this first council meeting in the new  settlement were preserved. It was decided that the nations down the  river and those of the north were, for the present, at least, incapable  of civilization. These tribes included the Montagnais, Etchemins,  Bersiamites, Papinachois and the great and little Esquimaux. They dwelt  in an uncultivated, barren and mountainous country, whose wild game and  fur-bearing animals sufficed to support them. Their habits were nomadic,  and excessive superstition was their only form of religion. By the  report of those who had visited the southern coasts, and had even  penetrated by land to Cadie, Cape Breton and Chaleurs Bay, Ile Perce and  Gaspe, the country there was more temperate, and susceptible of  cultivation. There would be found dispositions less estranged from  Christianity, as the people had more shame, docility and humanity than  the others.    With regard to the upper river and the territory of the numerous tribes  of Indians visited by Monsieur de Champlain and Father Joseph  themselves, or by others, besides possessing an abundance of game, which  might attract the French there in hopes of trade, the land was much more  fertile and the climate more congenial than in the Indian country down  the river. The upper river Indians, such as the Algonquins, Iroquois,  Hurons, Nipissirini, Neuters, Fire Nation, were sedentary, generally  docile, susceptible of instruction, charitable, strong, robust, patient;  insensible, however, and indifferent to all that concerns salvation;  lascivious, and so material that when told that their soul was immortal,  they would ask what they would eat after death in the next world. In  general, none of the savages whom they had known had any idea of a  divinity, believing, nevertheless, in another world where they hoped to  enjoy the same pleasures as they took here below--a people, in short,  without subordination, law or form of government or system, gross in  religious matters, shrewd and crafty for trade and profit, but  superstitious to excess.    It was the opinion of the council that none could ever succeed in  converting them, unless they made them men before they made them  Christians. To civilize them it was necessary first that the French  should mingle with them and habituate them to their presence and mode of  life, which could be done only by the increase of the colony, the  greatest obstacle to which was on the part of the gentlemen of the  company, who, to monopolize trade, did not wish the country to be  settled, and did not even wish to make the Indians sedentary, which was  the only condition favourable to the salvation of these heathen.    The Protestants, or Huguenots, having the best share in the trade, it  was to be feared that the contempt they showed for the Catholic  mysteries would greatly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17144"],[0,"The House of the Vampire (#16)"],[1,"a blow. A bundle of  manuscripts fell on the floor with a strange rustling noise. Then,  seizing his own story, he hurled it upon the table. And behold--the last  pages bore corrections in ink that could have been made only a few  minutes ago!    Reginald smiled. \"Have you come to play havoc with my manuscripts?\" he  remarked.    \"Your manuscripts? Reginald Clarke, you are an impudent impostor! You  have written no word that is your own. You are an embezzler of the mind,  strutting through life in borrowed and stolen plumes!\"    And at once the mask fell from Reginald's face.    \"Why stolen?\" he coolly said, with a slight touch of irritation. \"I  absorb. I appropriate. That is the most any artist can say for himself.  God creates; man moulds. He gives us the colours; we mix them.\"    \"That is not the question. I charge you with having wilfully and  criminally interfered in my life; I charge you with having robbed me of  what was mine; I charge you with being utterly vile and rapacious, a  hypocrite and a parasite!\"    \"Foolish boy,\" Reginald rejoined austerely. \"It is through me that the  best in you shall survive, even as the obscure Elizabethans live in him  of Avon. Shakespeare absorbed what was great in little men--a greatness  that otherwise would have perished--and gave it a setting, a life.\"    \"A thief may plead the same. I understand you better. It is your  inordinate vanity that prompts you to abuse your monstrous power.\"    \"You err. Self-love has never entered into my actions. I am careless of  personal fame. Look at me, boy! As I stand before you I am Homer, I am  Shakespeare ... I am every cosmic manifestation in art. Men have doubted  in each incarnation my individual existence. Historians have more to  tell of the meanest Athenian scribbler or Elizabethan poetaster than of  me. The radiance of my work obscured my very self. I care not. I have a  mission. I am a servant of the Lord. I am the vessel that bears the  Host!\"    He stood up at full length, the personification of grandeur and power. A  tremendous force trembled in his very finger tips. He was like a  gigantic dynamo, charged with the might of ten thousand magnetic storms  that shake the earth in its orbit and lash myriads of planets through  infinities of space....    Under ordinary circumstances Ernest or any other man would have quailed  before him. But the boy in that epic moment had grown out of his  stature. He felt the sword of vengeance in his hands; to him was  intrusted the cause of Abel and of Walkham, of Ethel and of Jack. His  was the struggle of the individual soul against the same blind and cruel  fate that in the past had fashioned the ichthyosaurus and the mastodon.    \"By what right,\" he cried, \"do you assume that you are the literary  Messiah? Who appointed you? What divine power has made you the steward  of my mite and of theirs whom you have robbed?\"    \"I am a light-bearer. I tread the high hills of mankind.... I point the  way to the future. I light up the abysses of the past. Were not my  stature gigantic, how could I hold the torch in all men's sight? The  very souls that I tread underfoot realise, as their dying gaze follows  me, the possibilities with which the future is big.... Eternally secure,  I carry the essence of what is cosmic ... of what is divine.... I am  Homer ... Goethe ... Shakespeare.... I am an embodiment of the same  force of which Alexander, Caesar, Confucius and the Christos were also  embodiments.... None so strong as to resist me.\"    A sudden madness overcame Ernest at this boast. He must strike now or  never. He must rid humanity of this dangerous maniac--this demon of  strength. With a power ten times intensified, he raised a heavy chair so  as to hurl it at Reginald's head and crush it.    Reginald stood there calmly, a smile upon his lips.... Primal cruelties  rose from the depth of his nature.... Still he smiled, turning his  luminous gaze upon the boy ... and, behold ... Ernest's hand began to  shake ... the chair fell from his grasp.... He tried to call for help,  but no sound issued from his lips.... Utterly paralysed he  confronted ... the Force....    Minutes--eternities passed.    And still those eyes were fixed upon him.    But this was no longer Reginald!    It was all brain ... only brain ... a tremendous brain-machine ...  infinitely complex ... infinitely strong. Not more than a mile away  Ethel endeavoured to call to him through the night. The telephone rang,  once, twice, thrice, insistingly. But Ernest heard it not. Something  dragged him ... dragged the nerves from his body dragged, dragged,  dragged.... It was an irresistible suction ... pitiless ... passionless  ... immense.    Sparks, blue, crimson and violet, seemed to play around the living  battery. It reached the finest fibres of his mind.... Slowly ... every  trace of mentality disappeared.... First the will ... then feeling ...  judgment ... memory ... fear even.... All that was stored in his  brain-cells came forth to be absorbed by that mighty engine....    The Princess With the Yellow Veil appeared ... flitted across the room  and melted away. She was followed by childhood memories ... girls'  heads, boys' faces.... He saw his dead mother waving her arms to him....  An expression of death-agony distorted the placid features.... Then,  throwing a kiss to him, she, too, disappeared. Picture on picture  followed.... Words of love that he had spoken ... sins, virtues,  magnanimities, meannesses, terrors ... mathematical formulas even, and  snatches of songs. Leontina came and was swallowed up.... No, it was  Ethel who was trying to speak to him ... trying to warn.... She waved  her hands in frantic despair.... She was gone.... A pale face ... dark,  dishevelled hair.... Jack.... How he had changed! He was in the circle  of the vampire's transforming might. \"Jack,\" he cried. Surely Jack had  something to explain ... something to tell him ... some word that if  spoken would bring rest to his soul. He saw the words rise to the boy's  lips, but before he had time to utter them his image also had vanished.  And Reginald ... Reginald, too, was gone.... There was only the mighty  brain ... panting ... whirling.... Then there was nothing.... The  annihilation of Ernest Fielding was complete.    Vacantly he stared at the walls, at the room and at his master. The  latter was wiping the sweat from his forehead. He breathed deeply....  The flush of youth spread over his features.... His eyes sparkled with a  new and dangerous brilliancy.... He took the thing that had once been  Ernest Fielding by the hand and led it to its room.          XXXI      With the first flush of the morning Ethel appeared at the door of the  house on Riverside Drive. She had not heard from Ernest, and had been  unable to obtain connection with him at the telephone. Anxiety had  hastened her steps. She brushed against Jack, who was also directing his  steps to the abode of Reginald Clarke.    At the same time something that resembled Ernest Fielding passed from  the house of the Vampire. It was a dull and brutish thing, hideously  transformed, without a vestige of mind.    \"Mr. Fielding,\" cried Ethel, beside herself with fear as she saw him  descending.    \"Ernest!\" Jack gasped, no less startled at the change in his friend's  appearance.    Ernest's head followed the source of the sound, but no spark of  recognition illumined the deadness of his eyes. Without a present and  without a past ... blindly ... a gibbering idiot ... he stumbled down  the stairs."]]]
