Besides, I sometimes get on the prod myself,  and when I do, I don't bar no man, Jew nor Gentile, horse, mare or  gelding. You may think different, but I'm not afraid of any man in  your outfit, from the gimlet to the big auger. I've tried to treat  you white, but I see I've failed. Now I want to give it out to you  straight and cold, that I'll pass you to-morrow, or mix two herds  trying. Think it over to-night and nominate your choice--be a  gentleman or a hog. Let your own sweet will determine which.'    \"I rode away in a walk, to give them a chance to say anything they  wanted to, but there were no further remarks. My men were all hopping  mad when I told them, but I promised them that to-morrow we would  fix them plenty or use up our supply of cartridges if necessary. We  dropped back a mile off the trail and camped for the night. Early the  next morning I sent one of my boys out on the highest sand dune to  Injun around and see what they were doing. After being gone for  an hour he came back and said they had thrown their cattle off the  bed-ground up the trail, and were pottering around like as they aimed  to move. Breakfast over, I sent him back again to make sure, for I  wanted yet to avoid trouble if they didn't draw it on. It was another  hour before he gave us the signal to come on. We were nicely strung  out where you saw those graves on that last ridge of sand-hills, when  there they were about a mile ahead of us, moseying along. This side of  Chapman's, the Indian trader's store, the old route turns to the right  and follows up this black-jack ridge. We kept up close, and just  as soon as they turned in to the right,--the only trail there was  then,--we threw off the course and came straight ahead, cross-country  style, same route we came over to-day, except there was no trail  there; we had to make a new one.    \"Now they watched us a plenty, but it seemed they couldn't make out  our game. When we pulled up even with them, half a mile apart, they  tumbled that my bluff of the day before was due to take effect without  further notice. Then they began to circle and ride around, and one  fellow went back, only hitting the high places, to their wagon and  saddle horses, and they were brought up on a trot. We were by this  time three quarters of a mile apart, when the boss of their outfit was  noticed riding out toward us. Calling one of my men, we rode out and  met him halfway. 'Young man, do you know just what you are trying to  do?' he asked.    \"'I think I do. You and myself as cowmen don't pace in the same class,  as you will see, if you will only watch the smoke of our tepee. Watch  us close, and I'll pass you between here and the next water.'    \"'We will see you in hell first!' he said, as he whirled his horse and  galloped back to his men. The race was on in a brisk walk. His wagon,  we noticed, cut in between the herds, until it reached the lead of his  cattle, when it halted suddenly, and we noticed that they were cutting  off a dry cowskin that swung under the wagon. At the same time two of  his men cut out a wild steer, and as he ran near their wagon one of  them roped and the other heeled him. It was neatly done. I called Big  Dick, my boss roper, and told him what I suspected,--that they were  going to try and stampede us with a dry cowskin tied to that steer's  tail they had down. As they let him up, it was clear I had called  the turn, as they headed him for our herd, the flint thumping at his  heels. Dick rode out in a lope, and I signaled for my crowd to come on  and we would back Dick's play. As we rode out together, I said to my  boys, 'The stuff's off, fellows! Shoot, and shoot to hurt!'    \"It seemed their whole outfit was driving that one steer, and turning  the others loose to graze. Dick never changed the course of that  steer, but let him head for ours, and as they met and passed, he  turned his horse and rode onto him as though he was a post driven in  the ground. Whirling a loop big enough to take in a yoke of oxen, he  dropped it over his off fore shoulder, took up his slack rope, and  when that steer went to the end of the rope, he was thrown in the air  and came down on his head with a broken neck. Dick shook the rope off  the dead steer's forelegs without dismounting, and was just beginning  to coil his rope when those varmints made a dash at him, shooting and  yelling.    \"That called for a counter play on our part, except our aim was low,  for if we didn't get a man, we were sure to leave one afoot. Just for  a minute the air was full of smoke. Two horses on our side went down  before you could say 'Jack Robinson,' but the men were unhurt, and  soon flattened themselves on the ground Indian fashion, and burnt the  grass in a half-circle in front of them. When everybody had emptied  his gun, each outfit broke back to its wagon to reload. Two of my men  came back afoot, each claiming that he had got his man all right,  all right. We were no men shy, which was lucky. Filling our guns with  cartridges out of our belts, we rode out to reconnoitre and try and  get the boys' saddles.    \"The first swell of the ground showed us the field. There were the  dead steer, and five or six horses scattered around likewise, but the  grass was too high to show the men that we felt were there. As the  opposition was keeping close to their wagon, we rode up to the scene  of carnage. While some of the boys were getting the saddles off the  dead horses, we found three men taking their last nap in the grass. I  recognized them as the boss-man, the fellow with the ha'r-trigger gun,  and a fool kid that had two guns on him when we were crossing their  cattle the day before. One gun wasn't plenty to do the fighting he was  hankering for; he had about as much use for two guns as a toad has for  a stinger.    \"The boys got the saddles off the dead horses, and went flying back to  our men afoot, and then rejoined us. The fight seemed over, or there  was some hitch in the programme, for we could see them hovering  near their wagon, tearing up white biled shirts out of a trunk and  bandaging up arms and legs, that they hadn't figured on any. Our herd  had been overlooked during the scrimmage, and had scattered so that  I had to send one man and the horse wrangler to round them in. We had  ten men left, and it was beginning to look as though hostilities had  ceased by mutual consent. You can see, son, we didn't bring it on. We  turned over the dead steer, and he proved to be a stray; at least he  hadn't their road brand on. One-eyed Jim said the ranch brand belonged  in San Saba County; he knew it well, the X--2. Well, it wasn't long  until our men afoot got a remount and only two horses shy on the first  round. We could stand another on the same terms in case they attacked  us. We rode out on a little hill about a quarter-mile from their  wagon, scattering out so as not to give them a pot shot, in case they  wanted to renew the unpleasantness.    \"When they saw us there, one fellow started toward us, waving his  handkerchief. We began speculating which one it was, but soon made him  out to be the cook; his occupation kept him out of the first round.  When he came within a hundred yards, I rode out and met him. He  offered me his hand and said, 'We are in a bad fix. Two of our crowd  have bad flesh wounds. Do you suppose we could get any whiskey back at  this Indian trader's store?'    \"'If there is any man in this territory can get any I can if they  have it,' I told him. 'Besides, if your lay-out has had all the  satisfaction fighting they want, we'll turn to and give you a lift. It  seems like you all have some dead men over back here. They will  have to be planted. So if your outfit feel as though you had your  belly-full of fighting for the present, consider us at your service.  You're the cook, ain't you?'    \"'Yes, sir,' he answered. 'Are all three dead?' he then inquired.    \"'Dead as heck,' I told him.    \"'Well, we are certainly in a bad box,' said he meditatingly. 'But  won't you all ride over to our wagon with me? I think our fellows are  pacified for the present.'    \"I motioned to our crowd, and we all rode over to their wagon with  him. There wasn't a gun in sight. The ragged edge of despair don't  describe them. I made them a little talk; told them that their boss  had cashed in, back over the hill; also if there was any segundo in  their outfit, the position of big augur was open to him, and we were  at his service.    \"There wasn't a man among them that had any sense left but the cook.  He told me to take charge of the killed, and if I could rustle a  little whiskey to do so. So I told the cook to empty out his wagon,  and we would take the dead ones back, make boxes for them, and bury  them at the store. Then I sent three of my men back to the store to  have the boxes ready and dig the graves. Before these three rode away,  I said, aside to Jim, who was one of them, 'Don't bother about any  whiskey; branch water is plenty nourishing for the wounded. It would  be a sin and shame to waste good liquor on plafry like them.'    \"The balance of us went over to the field of carnage and stripped the  saddles off their dead horses, and arranged the departed in a row,  covering them with saddle blankets, pending the planting act. I sent  part of my boys with our wagon to look after our own cattle for the  day. It took us all the afternoon to clean up a minute's work in the  morning.    \"I never like to refer to it. Fact was, all the boys felt gloomy for  weeks, but there was no avoiding it. Two months later, we met old man  Andy, way up at Fort Laramie on the North Platte. He was tickled to  death to meet us all. The herd had come through in fine condition. We  never told him anything about this until the cattle were delivered,  and we were celebrating the success of that drive at a near-by town.    \"Big Dick told him about this incident, and the old man"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12288"],[0,"The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut (1647-1697) (#16)"],[1," talke to ye Devill,  but she made nothing of it. Mr. Hooke further said, that he hath heard  that they that are adicted that way would hardly be kept away from ye  houses where they doe mischiefe, and so it was wth her when his boy was  sicke, she would not be kept away from him, nor gott away when she was  there, and one time Mris. Hooke bid her goe away, and thrust her from ye  boye, but she turned againe and said she would looke on him. Mris.  Goodyeare said that one time she questioned wth Elizabeth Godmand aboute  ye boyes sickness, and said what thinke you of him, is he not strangly  handled, she replyed, what, doe you thinke hee is bewitched; Mris.  Goodyeare said nay I will keepe my thoughts to myselfe, but in time God  will discouer ...    \"Mr. Hooke further said, that when Mr. Bishop was married, Mris. Godman  came to his house much troubled, so as he thought it might be from some  affection to him, and he asked her, she said yes; now it is suspitious  that so soone as they were contracted Mris. Byshop fell into verey  strang fitts wch hath continewed at times euer since, and much suspition  there is that she hath bine the cause of the loss of Mris. Byshops  chilldren, for she could tell when Mris. Bishop was to be brought to  bedd, and hath giuen out that she kills her chilldren wth longing,  because she longs for every thing she sees, wch Mris. Bishop denies....  Another thing suspitious is, that she could tell Mris. Atwater had figgs  in her pocket when she saw none of them; to that she answered she smelt  them, and could smell figgs if she came in the roome, nere them that had  them; yet at this time Mris. Atwater had figgs in her pocket and came  neere her, yet she smelt them not; also Mris. Atwater said that Mris.  Godman could tell that they one time had pease porridge, when they could  none of them tell how she came to know, and beeing asked she saith she  see ym on the table, and another time she saith she was there in ye  morning when the maide set them on. Further Mris. Atwater saith, that  that night the figgs was spoken of they had strangers to supper, and  Mris. Godman was at their house, she cutt a sopp and put in pann; Betty  Brewster called the maide to tell her & said she was aboute her workes  of darkness, and was suspitious of Mris. Godman, and spake to her of it,  and that night Betty Brewster was in a most misserable case, heareing a  most dreadfull noise wch put her in great feare and trembling, wch put  her into such a sweate as she was all on a water when Mary Miles came to  goe to bed, who had fallen into a sleepe by the fire wch vsed not to  doe, and in ye morning she looked as one yt had bine allmost dead....    \"Mris. Godman accused Mr. Goodyeare for calling her downe when Mris.  Bishop was in a sore fitt, to looke vpon her, and said he doubted all  was not well wth her, and that hee feared she was a witch, but Mr.  Goodyeare denyed that; vpon this Mris. Godman was exceeding angrie and  would haue the servants called to witnes, and bid George the Scochman  goe aske his master who bewitched her for she was not well, and vpon  this presently Hanah Lamberton (being in ye roome) fell into a verey  sore fitt in a verey strang maner....    \"Another time Mris. Goodyeare said to her, Mris. Elzebeth what thinke  you of my daughters case; she replyed what, doe you thinke I haue  bewitched her; Mris. Goodyeare said if you be the ptie looke to it, for  they intend to haue such as is suspected before the magistrate.    \"Mris. Godman charged Hanah Lamberton that she said she lay for somewhat  to sucke her, when she came in hott one day and put of some cloathes and  lay vpon the bed in her chamber. Hanah said she and her sister Elizabeth  went vp into the garet aboue her roome, and looked downe & said, looke  how she lies, she lyes as if som bodey was sucking her, & vpon that she  arose and said, yes, yes, so there is; after said Hanah, she hath  something there, for so there seemed as if something was vnder the  cloathes; Elizabeth said what haue you there, she said nothing but the  cloathes, and both Hanah & Eliza. say that Mris. Godman threatened  Hanah, and said let her looke to it for God will bring it vpon her owne  head, and about two dayes after, Hanahs fitts began, and one night  especially had a dreadfull fitt, and was pinched, and heard a hedious  noise, and was in a strang manner sweating and burning, and some time  cold and full of paine yt she shriked out.    \"Elizabeth Lamberton saith that one time ye chilldren came downe & said  Mris. Godman was talking to herselfe and they were afraide, then she  went vp softly and heard her talke, what, will you fetch me some beare,  will you goe, will you goe, and ye like, and one morning aboute breake  of day Henry Boutele said he heard her talke to herselfe, as if some  body had laine wth her....    \"Mris. Goodyeare said when Mr. Atwaters kinswoman was married Mris.  Bishop was there, and the roome being hott she was something fainte,  vpon that Mris. Godman said she would haue many of these fainting fitts  after she was married, but she saith she remembers it not....    \"Goodwife Thorp complained that Mris. Godman came to her house and asked  to buy some chickens, she said she had none to sell, Mris. Godman said  will you giue them all, so she went away, and she thought then that if  this woman was naught as folkes suspect, may be she will smite my  chickens, and quickly after one chicken dyed, and she remembred she had  heard if they were bewitched they would consume wthin, and she opened it  and it was consumed in ye gisard to water & wormes, and divers others of  them droped, and now they are missing and it is likely dead, and she  neuer saw either hen or chicken that was so consumed wthin wth wormes.  Mris. Godman said goodwife Tichenor had a whole brood so, and Mris.  Hooke had some so, but for Mris. Hookes it was contradicted presently.  This goodwife Thorp thought good to declare that it may be considered  wth other things.\"    The court decided that Elizabeth's carriage and confession rendered her  \"suspitious\" of witchcraft, and admonished her that \"if further proofe  come these passages will not be forgotten.\"    The further proof came forth promptly, since in August, 1655, Elizabeth  was again called before the court for witchcraft, and the witnesses  certified to \"the doing of strange things.\"    _The Governor's quandary--Elizabeth's \"spirituall armour\"--\"The  jumbling at the chamber dore\"--The lost grapes--The tethered  calfe--\"Hott beare\"_    \"At a court held at Newhaven the 7th of August 1655.    \"Elizabeth Godman was again called before the Court, and told that she  lies under suspition for witchcraft, as she knowes, the grounds of which  were examined in a former court, and by herselfe confessed to be just  grounds of suspition, wch passages were now read, and to these some more  are since added, wch are now to be declared.    \"Mr. Goodyeare said that the last winter, upon occasion of Gods  afflicting hand upon the plantation by sickness, the private meeting  whereof he is had appointed to set a day apart to seeke God: Elizabeth  Godman desired she might be there; he told her she was under suspition,  and it would be offensive; she said she had great need of it, for she  was exercised wth many temptations, and saw strange appearitions, and  lights aboute her bed, and strange sights wch affrighted her; some of  his family said if she was affraide they would worke wth her in the day  and lye with her in the night, but she refused and was angry and said  she would haue none to be wth her for she had her spirituall armour  aboute her. She was asked the reason of this; she answered, she said so  to Mr. Goodyeare, but it was her fancy troubled her, and she would haue  none lye wth her because her bed was weake; she was told that might haue  been mended; then she said she was not willing to haue any of them wth  her, for if any thing had fallen ill wth them they would haue said that  she had bine the cause.\"    Mr. Goodyeare further declared that aboute three weekes agoe he had a  verey great disturbance in his family in the night (Eliza: Godman hauing  bine the day before much discontented because Mr. Goodyeare warned her  to provide another place to live in) his daughter Sellevant, Hanah  Goodyeare, and Desire Lamberton lying together in the chamber under  Eliza: Godman; after they were in bed they heard her walke up and downe  and talk aloude; but could not tell what she said; then they heard her  go downe the staires and come up againe; they fell asleep, but were  after awakened wth a great jumbling at the chamber dore, and something  came into the chamber wch jumbled at the other end of the roome and  aboute the trunke and amonge the shooes and at the beds head; it came  nearer the bed and Hanah was affraid and called father, but he heard  not, wch made her more affraide; then cloathes were pulled of their bed  by something, two or three times; they held and something pulled, wch  frighted them so that Hanah Goodyeare called her father so loude as was  thought might be heard to the meetinghouse, but the noise was heard to  Mr. Samuell Eatons by them that watched wth her; so after a while Mr.  Goodyeare came and found them in a great fright; they lighted a candell  and he went to Eliza: Godmans chamber and asked her why she disturbed  the family; she said no, she was scared also and thought the house had  bine on fire, yet the next day she said in the family that she knew  nothing till Mr. Goodyeare came up, wch she said is true she heard the  noise but knew not the cause till Mr. Goodyeare came; and being asked  why she went downe staires after she was gon up to bed, she said to  light a candell to looke for two grapes she had lost in the flore and  feared the mice would play wth them in the night and disturbe ye family,  wch reason in the Courts apprehension renders her more suspitious.
