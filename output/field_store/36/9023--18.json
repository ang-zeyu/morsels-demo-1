[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#16)"],[1,"in \"Girlhood,\" and in       general there are numerous verbal discrepancies between the       versions of the journal and the letters in the two books.    The end of the crisis was now fast approaching. Sir Robert returned, and  told her that if she insisted upon retaining all her Ladies he could  not form a Government. She replied that she would send him her final  decision in writing. Next morning the late Whig Cabinet met. Lord  Melbourne read to them the Queen's letters, and the group of elderly  politicians were overcome by an extraordinary wave of enthusiasm. They  knew very well that, to say the least, it was highly doubtful whether  the Queen had acted in strict accordance with the constitution; that in  doing what she had done she had brushed aside Lord Melbourne's advice;  that, in reality, there was no public reason whatever why they should  go back upon their decision to resign. But such considerations vanished  before the passionate urgency of Victoria. The intensity of her  determination swept them headlong down the stream of her desire. They  unanimously felt that \"it was impossible to abandon such a Queen  and such a woman.\" Forgetting that they were no longer her Majesty's  Ministers, they took the unprecedented course of advising the Queen by  letter to put an end to her negotiation with Sir Robert Peel. She did  so; all was over; she had triumphed. That evening there was a ball at  the Palace. Everyone was present. \"Peel and the Duke of Wellington came  by looking very much put out.\" She was perfectly happy; Lord M. was  Prime Minister once more, and he was by her side.    VIII    Happiness had returned with Lord M., but it was happiness in the midst  of agitation. The domestic imbroglio continued unabated, until at last  the Duke, rejected as a Minister, was called in once again in his old  capacity as moral physician to the family. Something was accomplished  when, at last, he induced Sir John Conroy to resign his place about the  Duchess of Kent and leave the Palace for ever; something more when he  persuaded the Queen to write an affectionate letter to her mother. The  way seemed open for a reconciliation, but the Duchess was stormy still.  She didn't believe that Victoria had written that letter; it was not  in her handwriting; and she sent for the Duke to tell him so. The Duke,  assuring her that the letter was genuine, begged her to forget the past.  But that was not so easy. \"What am I to do if Lord Melbourne comes up to  me?\" \"Do, ma'am? Why, receive him with civility.\" Well, she would make  an effort... \"But what am I to do if Victoria asks me to shake hands  with Lehzen?\" \"Do, ma'am? Why, take her in your arms and kiss her.\"  \"What!\" The Duchess bristled in every feather, and then she burst into  a hearty laugh. \"No, ma'am, no,\" said the Duke, laughing too. \"I don't  mean you are to take Lehzen in your arms and kiss her, but the  Queen.\" The Duke might perhaps have succeeded, had not all attempts at  conciliation been rendered hopeless by a tragical event. Lady Flora,  it was discovered, had been suffering from a terrible internal malady,  which now grew rapidly worse. There could be little doubt that she was  dying. The Queen's unpopularity reached an extraordinary height. More  than once she was publicly insulted. \"Mrs. Melbourne,\" was shouted at  her when she appeared at her balcony; and, at Ascot, she was hissed  by the Duchess of Montrose and Lady Sarah Ingestre as she passed. Lady  Flora died. The whole scandal burst out again with redoubled vehemence;  while, in the Palace, the two parties were henceforth divided by an  impassable, a Stygian, gulf.    Nevertheless, Lord M. was back, and every trouble faded under the  enchantment of his presence and his conversation. He, on his side,  had gone through much; and his distresses were intensified by a  consciousness of his own shortcomings. He realised clearly enough that,  if he had intervened at the right moment, the Hastings scandal might  have been averted; and, in the bedchamber crisis, he knew that he had  allowed his judgment to be overruled and his conduct to be swayed by  private feelings and the impetuosity of Victoria. But he was not one  to suffer too acutely from the pangs of conscience. In spite of the  dullness and the formality of the Court, his relationship with the  Queen had come to be the dominating interest in his life; to have been  deprived of it would have been heartrending; that dread eventuality  had been--somehow--avoided; he was installed once more, in a kind of  triumph; let him enjoy the fleeting hours to the full! And so, cherished  by the favour of a sovereign and warmed by the adoration of a girl,  the autumn rose, in those autumn months of 1839, came to a wondrous  blooming. The petals expanded, beautifully, for the last time. For  the last time in this unlooked--for, this incongruous, this almost  incredible intercourse, the old epicure tasted the exquisiteness of  romance. To watch, to teach, to restrain, to encourage the royal  young creature beside him--that was much; to feel with such a constant  intimacy the impact of her quick affection, her radiant vitality--that  was more; most of all, perhaps, was it good to linger vaguely in  humorous contemplation, in idle apostrophe, to talk disconnectedly, to  make a little joke about an apple or a furbelow, to dream. The springs  of his sensibility, hidden deep within him, were overflowing. Often, as  he bent over her hand and kissed it, he found himself in tears.    Upon Victoria, with all her impermeability, it was inevitable that such  a companionship should have produced, eventually, an effect. She was no  longer the simple schoolgirl of two years since. The change was visible  even in her public demeanour. Her expression, once \"ingenuous  and serene,\" now appeared to a shrewd observer to be \"bold and  discontented.\" She had learnt something of the pleasures of power and  the pains of it; but that was not all. Lord Melbourne with his gentle  instruction had sought to lead her into the paths of wisdom and  moderation, but the whole unconscious movement of his character had  swayed her in a very different direction. The hard clear pebble,  subjected for so long and so constantly to that encircling and insidious  fluidity, had suffered a curious corrosion; it seemed to be actually  growing a little soft and a little clouded. Humanity and fallibility are  infectious things; was it possible that Lehzen's prim pupil had caught  them? That she was beginning to listen to siren voices? That the secret  impulses of self-expression, of self-indulgence even, were mastering  her life? For a moment the child of a new age looked back, and wavered  towards the eighteenth century. It was the most critical moment of her  career. Had those influences lasted, the development of her character,  the history of her life, would have been completely changed.    And why should they not last? She, for one, was very anxious that they  should. Let them last for ever! She was surrounded by Whigs, she was  free to do whatever she wanted, she had Lord M.; she could not believe  that she could ever be happier. Any change would be for the worse; and  the worst change of all... no, she would not hear of it; it would be  quite intolerable, it would upset everything, if she were to marry. And  yet everyone seemed to want her to--the general public, the Ministers,  her Saxe-Coburg relations--it was always the same story. Of course, she  knew very well that there were excellent reasons for it. For one thing,  if she remained childless, and were to die, her uncle Cumberland, who  was now the King of Hanover, would succeed to the Throne of England.  That, no doubt, would be a most unpleasant event; and she entirely  sympathised with everybody who wished to avoid it. But there was no  hurry; naturally, she would marry in the end--but not just yet--not for  three or four years. What was tiresome was that her uncle Leopold had  apparently determined, not only that she ought to marry, but that her  cousin Albert ought to be her husband. That was very like her uncle  Leopold, who wanted to have a finger in every pie; and it was true that  long ago, in far-off days, before her accession even, she had written to  him in a way which might well have encouraged him in such a notion. She  had told him then that Albert possessed \"every quality that could be  desired to render her perfectly happy,\" and had begged her \"dearest  uncle to take care of the health of one, now so dear to me, and to take  him under your special protection,\" adding, \"I hope and trust all will  go on prosperously and well on this subject of so much importance to  me.\" But that had been years ago, when she was a mere child; perhaps,  indeed, to judge from the language, the letter had been dictated by  Lehzen; at any rate, her feelings, and all the circumstances, had now  entirely changed. Albert hardly interested her at all.    In later life the Queen declared that she had never for a moment dreamt  of marrying anyone but her cousin; her letters and diaries tell a very  different story. On August 26, 1837, she wrote in her journal: \"To-day  is my dearest cousin Albert's 18th birthday, and I pray Heaven to pour  its choicest blessings on his beloved head!\" In the subsequent years,  however, the date passes unnoticed. It had been arranged that Stockmar  should accompany the Prince to Italy, and the faithful Baron left her  side for that purpose. He wrote to her more than once with sympathetic  descriptions of his young companion; but her mind was by this time made  up. She liked and admired Albert very much, but she did not want to  marry him. \"At present,\" she told Lord Melbourne in April, 1839, \"my  feeling is quite against ever marrying.\" When her cousin's Italian tour  came to an end, she began to grow nervous; she knew that, according to a  long-standing engagement, his next journey would be to England.

In Fig. 2 are seen duplicates of these insulated plates, connected  with an ordinary telephone receiver. With this receiver I can hear  distinctly the electric signals made by closing and opening the  Morse key in Fig. 1, and I believe that in a short time I shall be  able to perfect this system so as to send wireless messages over  long distances.  --Contributed by Dudley H. Cohen, New York.        ** Stop Crawling Water Colors [54]    To prevent water colors from crawling, add a few drops of ammonia  or lime water, or a solution of sal soda.        ** Small Electrical Hydrogen Generator [54]    A small hydrogen generator may be made from a fruit jar, A (see  sketch), with two tubes, B and C, soldered in the top. The plates  E can be made of tin or galvanized iron, and should be separated  about 1/8 in. by small pieces of wood. One of these plates is  connected to metal top, and the wire from the other passes through  the tube B, which is filled with melted rosin or wax, to make it  airtight. This wire connects to one side of a battery of two  cells, the other wire being soldered to the metal top of the jar,  as shown. The jar is partly filled with a very dilute solution of  sulphuric acid, about 1 part of acid to 20 of water.    When the current of electricity passes between the plates E,  hydrogen gas is generated, which rises and passes through the  rubber hose D, into the receiver G. This is a wide-mouth bottle,  which is filled with water and inverted over a pan of water, F.    [Illustration: Hydrogen Generator]    The gas bubbling up displaces the water and fills the bottle.    If the receiver is removed when half full of gas, the remaining  space will be filled with air, which will mix with the gas and  form an explosive mixture. If a lighted match is then held near  the mouth of the bottle a sharp report will be heard.    If the bottle is fitted with a cork containing two wires nearly  touching, and the apparatus connected with an induction coil, in  such a manner that a spark will be produced inside the bottle, the  explosion will blowout the cork or possibly break the bottle.  Caution should be used to avoid being struck by pieces of flying  glass if this experiment is tried, and under no condition should a  lighted match or spark be brought near the end of the rubber hose  D, as the presence of a little air in the generator will make an  explosive mixture which would probably break the jar.        ** Gasoline Burner for Model Work [55]    When making a small model traction engine or a locomotive the  question arises, \"What shall the fuel be?\" If you have decided to  use gasoline, then a suitable burner is necessary. A piece of  brass tubing about 3 in. in diameter and 6 in. long with caps  screwed on both ends and fitted with a filling plug and a bicycle  valve makes a good gasoline supply tank, says the Model Engineer,  London. The bicycle valve is used to give the tank an air pressure  which forces the gasoline to the burner.    The burner is made from a piece of brass tube, A, as is shown in  the illustration, 1/2 in. in diameter and 2-1/2 in. long, which is  plugged up at both ends, one end being drilled and reamed out to  5/16 in. Three rows of holes 1/16 in. in diameter are drilled in  the brass tube. One row is drilled to come directly on top, and  the other two at about 45 degrees from the vertical. It is then  fitted to a sheet steel base, B, by means of the clips, C C, Fig.  1. A piece of 1/8-in. copper pipe, P, is then coiled around the  brass tube, A, which forms the vaporizing coil. This coil should  have a diameter    [Illustration: Gasoline Burner]    of only 1 in. One end of the copper tube is bent around so it will  point directly into the reamed-out hole in the end of the brass  tube, A. A nipple, N, is made by drilling a 1/8-in. hole halfway  through a piece of brass and tapping to screw on the end of the  1/8-in. copper pipe. A 1/64-in. hole is then drilled through the  remaining part of the nipple. The other end of the copper tube is  connected to the supply tank. The distance between the nipple, N,  and the ends of the tube, A, should be only 5/16 of an inch. Fig.  2 shows the end view.        ** A Homemade Telephone Receiver [55]    A telephone receiver that will do good work may be built very  cheaply as follows: For the case use an ordinary 1/2-lb.  baking-powder box with a piece of heavy wire soldered on the  inside, 1-5/16 in. from the bottom. For the magnet use a piece of  round hardened steel about 3/8 in. in diameter and 1-1/4 in. long.  If desired, a piece of an old round file may be used for the  magnet core, which should be magnetized previous to assembling,  either by passing a current of electricity around it, or by direct  contact with another magnet. The steel core should be wound with  about 250 ft. of No. 36 insulated wire, the ends of which should  be soldered to a piece of    [Illustration: Telephone Receiver]    lamp cord, passed through a hole in the bottom of the can and  knotted inside to prevent pulling out.    A disk of thin sheet-iron, such as is used by photographers for  tintypes (Ferrotype), should be cut to the diameter of the can,  taking care not to bend the iron. The magnet should then be placed  in the bottom of the can in an upright position and enough of a  melted mixture of beeswax and resin poured in to hold it in  position.    While the wax is still in a plastic condition the magnet should be  located centrally and adjusted so that the end will be 1/16 in. or  less below the level of the top of the copper ring.    After the wax has hardened the disk is slipped in and fastened  tightly by a ring of solder when the instrument is ready for use.        ** How to Bind Magazines [56]    An easy way to bind Popular Mechanics in volumes of six months  each is to arrange the magazines in order and tie them securely  both ways with a strong cord. It is well to put two or three  sheets of tough white paper, cut to the size of the pages, at the  front and back for fly leaves.    Clamp the whole in a vise or clamp with two strips of wood even  with the back edges of the magazines. With a sharp saw cut a slit  in the magazines and wood strips about 1/2 in. deep and slanting  as shown at A and B, Fig. 1. Take two strips of stout cloth, about  8 or 10 in. long and as wide as the distance between the bottoms  of the sawed slits. Lay these over the back edge of the pack and  tie securely through the slits with a string thread--wrapping and  tying several times (C, Fig. 2).    If you have access to a printer's paper knife, trim both ends and  the front edge; this makes a much nicer book, but if the paper  knife cannot be used, clamp the whole between two boards and saw  off the edges, boards and all, smoothly, with a fine saw.    Cut four pieces of cardboard, 1/4 in. longer and 1/4 in. narrower  than the magazines after they have been trimmed. Lay one piece of  the board on the book and under the cloth strips. Use ordinary  flour paste and paste the strips to the cardboard and then rub  paste all over the top of the strips and the board. Rub paste over  one side of another piece of board and put it on top of the first  board and strips, pressing down firmly so that the strips are held  securely between the two boards. Turn the book over and do the  same with the other two boards.    After the paste has dried a few minutes take a piece of strong  cloth, duck or linen, fold and cut it 1 in. larger all around than  the book, leaving the folded edge uncut. Rub paste over one of the  board backs and lay one end of the cloth on it, smoothing and  creasing as shown at A, Fig. 3. Turn the book over and paste the  other side. The back edges should have a good coat of paste and a  strip of paper    [Illustration: Process of Homemade Binding]    the width of the thickness of the pack pasted on before pasting  the cloth to the second board back.    Cut off the corners and fold over the edges of the cloth, pasting  them down (Fig. 4). Rub paste on one side of a fly leaf and press  the back down on it. Turn the book over and paste a fly leaf to  the other back after the edges of the cloth have been folded down.  The backs must not be opened until the fly leaves are thoroughly  dry. Trim and tuck in the ends of the strip at the back edge.    When fixed this way your magazines make one of the most valuable  volumes you can possibly add to your library of mechanical books.  --Contributed by Joseph N. Parker, Bedford City, Va.        ** A Homemade Acetylene-Gas Generator [57]    A simple acetylene-gas generator used by myself for several years  when    [Illustration: Acetylene Gas Generator]    out on camping trips was made of a galvanized iron tank, without a  head, 18 in. in diameter and 30 in. deep, B, as shown in the  sketch. Another tank, A, is made the same depth as B, but its  diameter is a little smaller, so that inverted it will just slip  easily into the tank B. In the bottom, or rather the top now, of  tank A is cut a hole, and a little can, D, is fitted in it and  soldered. On top and over can D is soldered a large tin can screw.  A rubber washer is fitted on this so that when the screw top, E,  is turned on it, the joint will be gas tight. Another can, C,  which will just slip inside the little can, is perforated with a  number of holes. This can C is filled about half full of broken  pieces of carbide and then placed in the little can D. A gas cock,  H, is soldered onto tank A, as shown, from which the gas may be  taken through a rubber tube. Fill tank B with water and set tank A  into it. This will cause some air to be enclosed, which can be  released by leaving the cock open until tank A settles down to the  point where the water will begin to run in the perforations of the  little tank. The water then comes in contact with the carbide and  forms gas, which expands and stops the lowering of tank A. Then  the cock"]]]
