For although  we make this distinction in two aspects for our consideration, it must  be remarked that they are intimately connected, and that their  connection is involved in the idea of each when examined separately. We  have, on the one hand, recognized the Idea in the definite form of  freedom, conscious of and willing itself, having itself alone as its  object, involving at the same time the pure and simple Idea of Reason  and, likewise, what we have called Subject, self-consciousness, Spirit,  actually existing in the world. If, on the other hand, we consider  subjectivity, we find that subjective knowledge and will is thought. But  by the very act of thoughtful cognition and volition, I will the  universal object--the substance of absolute Reason. We observe,  therefore, an essential union between the objective side--the Idea, and  the subjective side--the personality that conceives and wills it. The  objective existence of this union is the State, which is therefore the  basis and centre of the other concrete elements of the life of a  people--of art, of law, of morals, of religion, of science. All the  activity of Spirit has only this object--the becoming conscious of this  union, i. e., of its own freedom. Among the forms of this conscious union  _religion_ occupies the highest position. In it Spirit-rising above the  limitations of temporal and secular existence--becomes conscious of the  Absolute Spirit, and, in this consciousness of the Self-Existent Being,  renounces its individual interest; it lays this aside in devotion--a  state of mind in which it refuses to occupy itself any longer with the  limited and particular. By sacrifice man expresses his renunciation of  his property, his will, his individual feelings. The religious  concentration of the soul appears in the form of feeling; it  nevertheless passes also into reflection; a form of worship (_cultus_)  is a result of reflection. The second form of the union of the objective  and subjective in the human spirit is art; this advances farther into  the realm of the actual and sensuous than religion. In its noblest walk  it is occupied with representing, not, indeed, the Spirit of God, but  certainly the Form of God; and, in its secondary aims, that which is  divine and spiritual generally. Its office is to render visible the  divine, presenting it to the imaginative and intuitive faculty. But the  true is the object not only of conception and feeling, as in  religion--and of intuition, as in art--but also of the thinking faculty;  and this gives us the third form of the union in question--philosophy.  This is consequently the highest, freest, and wisest place. Of course we  are not intending to investigate these three phases here; they have only  suggested themselves in virtue of their occupying the same general  ground as the object here considered the _State._          THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW (1832)    BY GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL    TRANSLATED BY J. LOEWENBERG, PH.D. Assistant in Philosophy, Harvard  University    THE STATE    IDEA AND AIM OF THE STATE      The State is the realization of the ethical idea. It is the ethical  spirit as revealed, self-conscious, substantial will. It is the will  which thinks and knows itself, and carries out what it knows, and in so  far as it knows. The unreflected existence of the State rests on custom,  and its reflected existence on the self-consciousness of the individual,  on his knowledge and activity. The individual, in return, has his  substantial freedom in the State, as the essence, purpose, and product  of his activity.    The true State is the ethical whole and the realization of freedom. It  is the absolute purpose of reason that freedom should be realized. The  State is the spirit, which lives in the world and there realizes itself  consciously; while in nature it is actual only as its own other or as  dormant spirit. Only as present in consciousness, knowing itself as an  existing object, is it the State. The State is the march of God through  the world, its ground is the power of reason realizing itself as will.  The idea of the State should not connote any particular State, or  particular institution; one must rather consider the Idea only, this  actual God, by itself. Because it is more easy to find defects than to  grasp the positive meaning, one readily falls into the mistake of  emphasizing so much the particular nature of the State as to overlook  its inner organic essence. The State is no work of art. It exists in the  world, and thus in the realm of caprice, accident, and error. Evil  behavior toward it may disfigure it on many sides. But the ugliest man,  the criminal, the invalid, and the cripple, are still living human  beings. The affirmative, life, persists in spite of defects, and it is  this affirmative which alone is here in question.    In the State, everything depends upon the unity of the universal and the  particular. In the ancient States the subjective purpose was absolutely  one with the will of the State. In modern times, on the contrary, we  demand an individual opinion, an individual will and conscience. The  ancients had none of these in the modern sense; the final thing for them  was the will of the State. While in Asiatic despotisms the individual  had no inner self and no self-justification, in the modern world man  demands to be honored for the sake of his subjective individuality.    The union of duty and right has the twofold aspect that what the State  demands as duty should directly be the right of the individual, since  the State is nothing but the organization of the concept of freedom. The  determinations of the individual will are given by the State  objectivity, and it is through the State alone that they attain truth  and realization. The State is the sole condition of the attainment of  the particular end and good.    Political disposition, called patriotism--the assurance resting in truth  and the will which has become a custom--is simply the result of the  institutions subsisting in the State, institutions in which reason is  actually present.    Under patriotism one frequently understands a mere willingness to  perform extraordinary acts and sacrifices. But patriotism is essentially  the sentiment of regarding, in the ordinary circumstances and ways of  life, the weal of the community as the substantial basis and the final  end. It is upon this consciousness, present in the ordinary course of  life and under all circumstances, that the disposition to heroic effort  is founded. But as people are often rather magnanimous than just, they  easily persuade themselves that they possess the heroic kind of  patriotism, in order to save themselves the trouble of having the truly  patriotic sentiment, or to excuse the lack of it.    Political sentiment, as appearance, must be distinguished from what  people truly will. What they at bottom will is the real cause, but they  cling to particular interests and delight in the vain contemplation of  improvements. The conviction of the necessary stability of the State in  which alone the particular interests can be realized, people indeed  possess, but custom makes invisible that upon which our whole existence  rests; it does not occur to any one, when he safely passes through the  streets at night, that it could be otherwise. The habit of safety has  become a second nature, and we do not reflect that it is the result of  the activity of special institutions. It is through force this is  frequently the superficial opinion-that the State coheres, but what  alone holds it together is the fundamental sense of order, which is  possessed by all.    The State is an organism or the development of the idea into its  differences. These different sides are the different powers of the State  with their functions and activities, by means of which the universal is  constantly and necessarily producing itself, and, being presupposed in  its own productive function, it is thus always actively present. This  organism is the political constitution. It eternally springs from the  State, just as the State in turn maintains itself through the  constitution. If these two things fall asunder, if both different sides  become independent of each other, then the unity which the constitution  produces is no longer operative; the fable of the stomach and the other  organs may be applied to it. It is the nature of an organism that all  its parts must constitute a certain unity; if one part asserts its  independence the other parts must go to destruction. No predicates,  principles, and the like suffice to express the nature of the State; it  must be comprehended as an organism.    The State is real, and its reality consists in the interest of the whole  being realized in particular ends. Actuality is always the unity of  universality and particularity, and the differentiation of the universal  into particular ends. These particular ends seem independent, though  they are borne and sustained by the whole only. In so far as this unity  is absent, no thing is real, though it may exist. A bad State is one  which merely exists. A sick body also exists; but it has no true  reality. A hand, which is cut off, still looks like a hand and exists,  but it has no reality. True reality is necessity. What is real is  internally necessary.    To the complete State belongs, essentially, consciousness and thought.  The State knows thus what it wills, and it knows it under the form of  thought.    The essential difference between the State and religion consists in that  the commands of the State have the form of legal duty, irrespective of  the feelings accompanying their performance; the sphere of religion, on  the other hand, is in the inner life. Just as the State, were it to  frame its commands as religion does, would endanger the right of the  inner life, so the church, if it acts as a State and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],[0,"Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#16)"],[1,", and was there confined, guarded by five  men.    About dusk the constable and the crowd took Miller to Le Roy,  where he was taken before the justice who had issued the warrant,  when all his prosecutors, together with constable and warrant,  disappeared. As no one appeared against the prisoner, the justice  told him he was at liberty to go.    From the docket of the justice it appeared that the warrant had  been issued at the request of Daniel Johns, Miller's partner.    The leaders were indicted for riot, assault, and false  imprisonment, tried, three found guilty and imprisoned. At the  trial there was evidence to show that on the morning of the 12th a  meeting was held in the third story of the stone building at  Stafford, a leader selected, and plans arranged.    On the evening of Tuesday 12th a neighbor of Morgan's called at  the Canandaigua jail and asked to see Morgan. The jailer was  absent. His wife permitted the man to speak to Morgan, and the man  said that he had come to pay the debt for which Morgan was  committed and to take him home. Morgan was asked if he were  willing to go; he answered that he was willing, but that it did  not matter particularly that night, for he could just as well wait  until morning; but the man said \"No,\" that he would rather take  him out that night, for he had run around all day for him and was  very tired and wished to get home. The man offered to deposit with  the jailer's wife five dollars as security for the payment of the  debt and all costs, but she would not let Morgan out, saying that  she did not know the man and that he was not the owner of the  judgment.    The man went out and was gone a few minutes, and brought back a  well-known resident of the village of Canandaigua and the owner of  the judgment; these two men said that it was all right for the  jailer's wife to accept two dollars, the amount of the judgment,  and release Morgan. Taking the money, the woman opened the inside  door of the prison, and Morgan was requested to get ready quickly  and come out. He was soon ready, and walked out of the front door  between the man who had called for him and another. The jailer's  wife while fastening the inside prison-door heard a cry of murder  near the outer door of the jail, and running to the door she saw  Morgan struggling with the two men who had come for him. He  continued to scream and cry in the most distressing manner, at the  same time struggling with all his strength; his voice was  suppressed by something that was put over his mouth, and a man  following behind rapped loudly upon the well-curb with a stick; a  carriage came up, Morgan was put in it by the two men with him,  and the carriage drove off. It was a moonlight night, and the  jailer's wife clearly saw all that transpired, and even remembered  that the horses were gray. Neither the man who made the complaint  nor the resident of Canandaigua who came to the jail and advised  the jailer's wife that she could safely let Morgan go went with  the carriage. They picked up Morgan's hat, which was lost in the  struggle, and watched the carriage drive away.    The account given by the wife of the jailer was corroborated by a  number of entirely reliable and reputable witnesses.    A man living near the jail went to the door of his house and saw  the men struggling in the street, one of them apparently down and  making noises of distress; the man went towards the struggling  man, and asked a man who was a little behind the others what was  the matter, to which he answered, \"Nothing; only a man has been  let out of jail, and been taken on a warrant, and is going to be  tried, or have his trial.\"    In January following, when the feeling was growing against the  abductors of Morgan, the three men in Canandaigua most prominently  connected with all that transpired at the jail on the night in  question made statements in court under oath, which admitted the  facts to be substantially as above outlined, except they insisted  that they did not know why Morgan struggled before getting into  the carriage. These men expressed regret that they did not go to  the assistance of Morgan, and insisted that was the only fault  they committed on the night in question. They admitted that they  understood that Morgan was compiling a book on the subject of  Masonry at the instigation of Miller the publisher at Batavia, and  alleged that he was getting up the book solely for pecuniary  profit, and they believed it was desirable to remove Morgan to  some place beyond the influence of Miller, where his friends and  acquaintances might convince him of the impropriety of his conduct  and persuade him to abandon the publication of the book.    In passing sentence, the court said:    \"The legislature have not seen fit, perhaps, from the supposed  improbability that the crime would be attempted, to make your  offence a felony. Its grade and punishment have been left to the  provisions of the common law, which treats it as a misdemeanor,  and punishes it with fine and imprisonment in the common jail. The  court are of opinion that your liberty ought to be made to answer  for the liberty of Morgan: his person was restrained by force; and  the court, in the exercise of its lawful powers, ought not to be  more tender of your liberty than you, in the plenitude of lawless  force, were of his.\"    It is quite clear that up to this time none of the to do parties  connected directly or indirectly with the abduction of Morgan had  any intention whatsoever of doing him bodily harm. If such had  been their purpose, the course they followed was foolish in the  extreme. The simple fact was the Masons were greatly excited over  the threatened exposure of the secrets of their order by one of  their own members, and they desired to get hold of the manuscript  and proofs and prevent the publication, and the misguided  hot-heads who were active in the matter thought that by getting  Morgan away from Miller they could persuade him to abandon his  project. This theory is borne out by the fact that on the day Morgan  was taken to Canandaigua several prominent men of Batavia called  upon Mrs. Morgan and told her that if she would give up to the  Masons the papers she had in her possession Morgan would be brought  back. She gave up all the papers she could find; they were submitted  to Johns, the former partner of Miller, who said that part of the  manuscript was not there. However, the men took Mrs. Morgan to  Canandaigua, stopping at Avon over night. These men expected to find  Morgan still in Canandaigua, but were surprised to learn that he had  been taken away the night before, whereupon Mrs. Morgan, having left  her two small children at home, returned as quickly as possible.    So far as Morgan's manuscript is concerned, it seems that a  portion of it was already in the hands of Miller, and another  portion secreted inside of a bed at the time he was arrested, so  that not long after his disappearance what purports to be his book  was published.    Nearly two years later, in August, 1828, three men were tried for  conspiracy to kidnap and carry away Morgan. At that time it was  believed by many that Morgan was either simply detained abroad or  in hiding, although it was strenuously insisted by others that he  had been killed. All that was ever known of his movements after he  left the jail at Canandaigua on the night of September 11 was  developed in the testimony taken at this trial.    One witness who saw the carriage drive past the jail testified  that a man was put in by four others, who got in after him and the  carriage drove away; the witness was near the men when they got  into the carriage, and as it turned west he heard one of them cry  to the driver, \"Why don't you drive faster? why don't you drive  faster?\"    The driver testified that some time prior to the date in question  a man came to him and arranged for him to take a party to  Rochester on or about the 12th. On the night in question he took  his yellow carriage and gray horses about nine o'clock and drove  just beyond the Canandaigua jail on the Palmyra road. A party of  five got into the carriage, but he heard no noise and saw no  resistance, nor did he know any of the men. He was told to go on  beyond Rochester, and he took the Lewiston road. On arriving at  Hanford's one of the party got out; he then drove about one  hundred yards beyond the house, stopping near a piece of woods,  where the others who were in the carriage got out, and he turned  around and drove back.    Another man who lived at Lewiston and worked as a stage-driver  said that he was called between ten and twelve o'clock at night  and told to drive a certain carriage into a back street alongside  of another carriage which he found standing there without any  horse attached to it; some men were standing near it. He drove  alongside the carriage, and one or two men got out of it and got  into his hack. He saw no violence, but on stopping at a point  about six miles farther on some of the men got out, and while they  were conversing, some one in the carriage asked for water in a  whining voice, to which one of the men replied, \"You shall have  some in a moment.\" No water was handed to the person in the  carriage, but the men got in, and he drove them on to a point  about half a mile from Fort Niagara, where they told him to stop;  there were no houses there; the party, four in number, got out and  proceeded side by side towards the fort; he drove back with his  carriage.    A man living in Lewiston swore that he went to his door and saw a  carriage coming, which went a little distance farther on, stopping  beside another carriage which was in the street without horses; he  recognized the driver of the carriage and one other man; he  thought something strange was going on and went into his garden,  where he had a good view of what took place in the road; he saw a  man go from the box of the carriage which "]]]
