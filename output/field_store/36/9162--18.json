Naturally they had fallen asleep, as all other hard  working citizens had, and while they slept the prisoners made a hole  somewhere and escaped.    Steele examined the hole, and then engaged a stripling of a youth to see  if he could crawl through. The youngster essayed the job, stuck in the  middle, and was with difficulty extricated.    Whereupon the crowd evinced its delight.    Steele, without more ado, shoved his jailer and guard inside his jail,  deliberately closed, barred and chained the iron bolted door, and put  the key in his pocket. Then he remained there all day without giving  heed to his prisoners' threats.    Toward evening, having gone without drink infinitely longer than was  customary, they made appeals, to which Steele was deaf.    He left the jail, however, just before dark, and when we met he told me  to be on hand to help him watch that night. We went around the outskirts  of town, carrying two heavy double-barreled shotguns Steele had gotten  somewhere and taking up a position behind bushes in the lot adjoining  the jail; we awaited developments.    Steele was not above paying back these fellows.    All the early part of the evening, gangs of half a dozen men or more  came down the street and had their last treat at the expense of the jail  guard and jailer. These prisoners yelled for drink--not water but drink,  and the more they yelled the more merriment was loosed upon the night  air.    About ten o'clock the last gang left, to the despair of the hungry and  thirsty prisoners.    Steele and I had hugely enjoyed the fun, and thought the best part of  the joke for us was yet to come. The moon had arisen, and though  somewhat hazed by clouds, had lightened the night. We were hidden about  sixty paces from the jail, a little above it, and we had a fine command  of the door.    About eleven o'clock, when all was still, we heard soft steps back of  the jail, and soon two dark forms stole round in front. They laid down  something that gave forth a metallic clink, like a crowbar. We heard  whisperings and then, low, coarse laughs.    Then the rescuers, who undoubtedly were Miller and Bass, set to work to  open the door. Softly they worked at first, but as that door had been  put there to stay, and they were not fond of hard work, they began to  swear and make noises.    Steele whispered to me to wait until the door had been opened, and then  when all four presented a good target, to fire both barrels. We could  easily have slipped down and captured the rescuers, but that was not  Steele's game.    A trick met by a trick; cunning matching craft would be the surest of  all ways to command respect.    Four times the workers had to rest, and once they were so enraged at the  insistence of the prisoners, who wanted to delay proceedings to send one  of them after a bottle, that they swore they would go away and cut the  job altogether.    But they were prevailed upon to stay and attack the stout door once  more. Finally it yielded, with enough noise to have awakened sleepers a  block distant, and forth into the moonlight came rescuers and rescued  with low, satisfied grunts of laughter.    Just then Steele and I each discharged both barrels, and the reports  blended as one in a tremendous boom.    That little compact bunch disintegrated like quicksilver. Two stumbled  over; the others leaped out, and all yelled in pain and terror. Then the  fallen ones scrambled up and began to hobble and limp and jerk along  after their comrades.    Before the four of them got out of sight they had ceased their yells,  but were moving slowly, hanging on to one another in a way that  satisfied us they would be lame for many a day.    Next morning at breakfast Dick regaled me with an elaborate story about  how the Ranger had turned the tables on the jokers. Evidently in a night  the whole town knew it.    Probably a desperate stand of Steele's even to the extreme of killing  men, could not have educated these crude natives so quickly into the  realization that the Ranger was not to be fooled with.    That morning I went for a ride with the girls, and both had heard  something and wanted to know everything. I had become a news-carrier,  and Miss Sampson never thought of questioning me in regard to my fund of  information.    She showed more than curiosity. The account I gave of the jail affair  amused her and made Sally laugh heartily.    Diane questioned me also about a rumor that had come to her concerning  George Wright.    He had wounded himself with a gun, it seemed, and though not seriously  injured, was not able to go about. He had not been up to the ranch for  days.    \"I asked papa about him,\" said, Diane, \"and papa laughed like--well,  like a regular hyena. I was dumbfounded. Papa's so queer. He looked  thunder-clouds at me.    \"When I insisted, for I wanted to know, he ripped out: 'Yes, the damn  fool got himself shot, and I'm sorry it's not worse.'    \"Now, Russ, what do you make of my dad? Cheerful and kind, isn't he?\"    I laughed with Sally, but I disclaimed any knowledge of George's  accident. I hated the thought of Wright, let alone anything concerning  the fatal certainty that sooner or later these cousins of his were to  suffer through him.    Sally did not make these rides easy for me, for she was sweeter than  anything that has a name. Since the evening of the dance I had tried to  avoid her. Either she was sincerely sorry for her tantrum or she was  bent upon utterly destroying my peace.    I took good care we were never alone, for in that case, if she ever got  into my arms again I would find the ground slipping from under me.    Despite, however, the wear and constant strain of resisting Sally, I  enjoyed the ride. There was a charm about being with these girls.    Then perhaps Miss Sampson's growing unconscious curiosity in regard to  Steele was no little satisfaction to me.    I pretended a reluctance to speak of the Ranger, but when I did it was  to drop a subtle word or briefly tell of an action that suggested such.    I never again hinted the thing that had been such a shock to her. What  was in her mind I could not guess; her curiosity, perhaps the greater  part, was due to a generous nature not entirely satisfied with itself.  She probably had not abandoned her father's estimate of the Ranger but  absolute assurance that this was just did not abide with her. For the  rest she was like any other girl, a worshipper of the lion in a man, a  weaver of romance, ignorant of her own heart.    Not the least talked of and speculated upon of all the details of the  jail incident was the part played by Storekeeper Jones, who had informed  upon his assailants. Steele and I both awaited results of this  significant fact.    When would the town wake up, not only to a little nerve, but to the  usefulness of a Ranger?    Three days afterward Steele told me a woman accosted him on the street.  She seemed a poor, hardworking person, plain spoken and honest.    Her husband did not drink enough to complain of, but he liked to gamble  and he had been fleeced by a crooked game in Jack Martin's saloon. Other  wives could make the same complaints. It was God's blessing for such  women that Ranger Steele had come to Linrock.    Of course, he could not get back the lost money, but would it be  possible to close Martin's place, or at least break up the crooked game?    Steele had asked this woman, whose name was Price, how much her husband  had lost, and, being told, he assured her that if he found evidence of  cheating, not only would he get back the money, but also he would shut  up Martin's place.    Steele instructed me to go that night to the saloon in question and get  in the game. I complied, and, in order not to be overcarefully sized up  by the dealer, I pretended to be well under the influence of liquor.    By nine o'clock, when Steele strolled in, I had the game well studied,  and a more flagrantly crooked one I had never sat in. It was barefaced  robbery.    Steele and I had agreed upon a sign from me, because he was not so adept  in the intricacies of gambling as I was. I was not in a hurry, however,  for there was a little frecklefaced cattleman in the game, and he had  been losing, too. He had sold a bunch of stock that day and had  considerable money, which evidently he was to be deprived of before he  got started for Del Rio.    Steele stood at our backs, and I could feel his presence. He thrilled  me. He had some kind of effect on the others, especially the dealer, who  was honest enough while the Ranger looked on.    When, however, Steele shifted his attention to other tables and players  our dealer reverted to his crooked work. I was about to make a  disturbance, when the little cattleman, leaning over, fire in his eye  and gun in hand, made it for me.    Evidently he was a keener and nervier gambler than he had been taken  for. There might have been gun-play right then if Steele had not  interfered.    \"Hold on!\" he yelled, leaping for our table. \"Put up your gun!\"    \"Who are you?\" demanded the cattleman, never moving. \"Better keep out of  this.\"    \"I'm Steele. Put up your gun.\"    \"You're thet Ranger, hey?\" replied the other. \"All right! But just a  minute. I want this dealer to sit quiet. I've been robbed. And I want my  money back.\"    Certainly the dealer and everyone else round the table sat quiet while  the cattleman coolly held his gun leveled.    \"Crooked game?\" asked Steele, bending over the table. \"Show me.\"    It did not take the aggrieved gambler more than a moment to prove his  assertion. Steele, however, desired corroboration from others beside the  cattleman, and one by one he questioned them.    To my surprise, one of the players admitted his conviction that the game  was not straight.    \"What do you say?\" demanded Steele of me.    \"Worse'n a hold-up, Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15586"],[0,"India, Old and New (#16)"],[1,"than a  trading association could safely be left to discharge uncontrolled, and  that the State could not divest itself of the duties imposed upon it by  the acquisition of vast and populous possessions. It would be idle to  pretend that the British people already entertained any definite  conception of a tutelary relationship towards the peoples of India, or  were animated by purely philanthropic solicitude for the moral welfare  of India. But the passionate oratory of Fox and Burke and their fervid  denunciation of oppression and wrongdoing in India awoke responsive  echoes far beyond the walls of Westminster. In 1762, when France had  claimed, in the course of the peace negotiations which led to the Treaty  of Paris, the restitution of the possessions she had lost to the East  India Company, the British Government pleaded the absence of \"any right  of the Crown of England to interfere in the legal and exclusive property  of a body corporate.\" Only eleven years later, the House of Commons  passed resolutions to the effect that \"all acquisitions made under the  influence of military force or by treaty with foreign princes do of  right belong to the State,\" and the Commons had the country behind them.  From 1773 onward British public opinion never hesitated to support  Parliament in claiming and exercising supreme control over Indian  affairs.    A very brief survey of the long series of enactments in which  Parliament, asserting the right of \"eminent dominion over every British  subject in every country,\" gradually established its authority over  Indian administration and moulded it to the shape which it virtually  preserved until the Crown assumed direct sovereignty in 1858, shows how  steadily the strengthening of Parliamentary control kept pace with the  extension of British dominion in India. The first of these legislative  measures was Lord North's Regulating Act, which was passed in 1773, just  eight years after the East India Company had acquired for the first time  the right of revenue and civil administration over vast territories in  Bengal and in the Madras \"Northern Circars,\" and thereby taken over the  duties of government in respect of a great native population, absolutely  alien in race, in religion, and in customs. Lord North's Act did not  attack directly the problem of Indian government, but it sought to  facilitate its solution by the East India Company itself by reforming  its constitution at home, where the jealousies and intrigues of rival  factions in the Board of Directors had often reached the dimensions of a  public scandal, and by centralising the Company's authority in India,  where, as the result of recent developments which had now established  the centre of British gravity in Bengal, the post of Governor-General  was created for the Bengal Presidency and invested with powers of  control over the other Presidencies, Madras and Bombay, which had  hitherto enjoyed a status of practical equality. At the same time an  attempt was made to strengthen control from home by enjoining upon the  Governor-General to keep the Board of Directors in London fully informed  and to abide by its instructions, whilst a check was placed upon the  executive authority in Bengal by the creation of a Supreme Court in  Calcutta from which the present High Court is descended.    The defect of this legislation--a defect inherent to the situation in  India itself--was the dualism it created by endeavouring to enforce  Parliamentary restraints upon a Company which derived its title to  government over the greater part of its possessions from the  irresponsible despotism of the Moghul emperors. The Company was thus  made to serve two masters, and at the same time it remained essentially  a great trading corporation whose commercial and fiscal interests were  always liable to conflict, and sometimes did conflict, with its duties  towards both masters. The total collapse of the Moghul Empire removed  before long one of the ambiguities of this situation, but the other  endured in a greater or less degree until the East India Company itself  disappeared, though every subsequent measure of Indian legislation at  home tended to bring the Indian executive more and more fully under the  control of the home Government.    Eleven years later Pitt's famous Government of India Act of 1784 marked  a very important step forward. Another great war had been brought to an  end by the Peace of Versailles in 1783, and whilst at its close we had  lost the greater part of our North American Colonies, the genius of  Warren Hastings had saved and consolidated British power in India. It  was easy to criticise, and if we are to judge in accordance with modern  standards, it is doubtless right to condemn some of the devices to which  he resorted in the course of the long struggle he was often left to wage  with little or no help, and sometimes in the face of active obstruction  from those who, at home and in India, should have been the first to  support him. Whatever his errors may have been, they were more than  atoned for by the cruel persecution to which he was subjected whilst  England was harvesting the fruits of his energy and courage. Pitt's Act  was in fact the solemn consecration of all his greatest achievements,  whilst it brought India into closer and more direct relationship with  the Crown. Not the least of the difficulties with which Hastings, the  only Governor-General appointed by the East India Company, was  confronted arose from frequent opposition in his own Council, where he  was merely _primus inter pares_. Pitt took care to provide against the  recurrence of similar trouble in the future. But having strengthened the  Governor-General's position, he took away the right of appointing him  from the Company and transferred it to the Crown. Nor was that all. The  Company itself was placed under the effective control of the Crown by  the establishment in London of a Board of Control, of which the  President was ultimately to develop into the Secretary of State for  India, over the Courts of Directors and Proprietors. In substance, if  not in form, India was already becoming a Dependency of the British  Crown.    Nor was Pitt's Act concerned only with the relations of the Company to  the Crown. Its numerous and very drastic provisions for the prevention  and punishment of the corruption and oppression which had become rampant  amongst the Company's servants after the grant of the _Diwani_ testified  to the determination of Parliament, whilst acquiescing in the extension  of the British dominion, to uphold and enforce at the same time in the  governance of Indian peoples the principle of justice for all to which  the British people had gradually fought their way. A strong impetus was  thus given to the great reforms already initiated by Clive himself, and  still more drastically by Warren Hastings, which, within the framework  as far as possible of the old indigenous system of judicial and civil  administration, built up on solid foundations of integrity and  efficiency a capacious and elastic structure easily extended to the vast  territories that were still to pass under British rule. But then no  more than at any later period could the machinery of government have  worked smoothly, or even at all, without the co-operation of the Indians  themselves, who were recruited in large numbers into the Company's  service. Respect for their traditional customs and beliefs, and  encouragement, of which Warren Hastings was the first to recognise the  importance, to Indian education, though still only on the old lines with  which Indians were already familiar, secured the growing loyalty of  their co-operation. Then, as now, it was nowhere more effective than in  the judicial administration, and side by side with new tribunals, which  conformed with Western jurisprudence, the old ones, purified and  reorganised, continued to dispense justice in accordance mainly with  Hindu and Mahomedan and Indian customary law. With the consolidation of  the British Paramount Power Indians learnt to identify it with their  ancient conception of the State, and the Company's service came to enjoy  the popularity and prestige which had always attached to the service of  the State under their indigenous rulers and even under Mahomedan  domination.    The renewal of the Company's Charter, which took place at intervals of  twenty years, dating from Lord North's Act of 1773, afforded a  convenient opportunity for the revision, when required, both of its  relations to the Crown and of its methods of government in India. The  abrogation of its trading monopoly in 1813 was mainly a concession to  opposition at home, quickened by the loss of the European markets which  had been closed against Great Britain by Napoleon's continental system,  and for the renewal of its Charter the Company had to surrender its  trading monopoly. It was the first step towards the abrogation of all  its trading privileges twenty years later, when the Company, finally  delivered from the temptations which beset a commercial corporation,  became for the first time a purely governing body, free to devote its  entire energies to the discharge of the immense responsibilities that  had devolved upon it. This was, however, only one, though not the least  significant of the momentous changes that accompanied the renewal of the  Charter in 1833.    The trend of events in Europe after the peace in 1815 had tended to  accentuate the profound divergency of views between Great Britain and  the leading continental Powers in regard to fundamental principles of  government, which, dating back to the seventeenth century, had been  arrested at the close of the eighteenth by the exigencies of common  action against the excesses of the French Revolution and the inordinate  ambition of Napoleon. Under the auspices of the Holy Alliance, the  continent of Europe was drifting into blind"]]]
