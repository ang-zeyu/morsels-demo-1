On a day of humiliation for disappointments in war.    1 Lord, hast thou cast the nation off?  Must we for ever mourn?  Wilt thou indulge immortal wrath?  Shall mercy ne'er return?    2 The terror of one frown of thine  Melts all our strength away;  Like men that totter drunk with wine,  We tremble in dismay.    3 Great Britain shakes beneath thy stroke,  And dreads thy threatening hand;  O heal the island thou hast broke,  Confirm the wavering land.    4 Lift up a banner in the field,  For those that fear thy Name;  Save thy beloved with thy shield,  And put our foes to shame.    5 Go with our armies to the fight,  Like a confederate God;  In vain confederate powers unite  Against thy lifted rod.    6 Our troops shall gain a wide renown  By thine assisting hand;  'Tis God that treads the mighty down,  And makes the feeble stand.      Psalm 61. 1-6.  Safety in God.    1 When overwhelm'd with grief  My heart within me dies,  Helpless and far from all relief  To heaven I lift mine eyes.    2 O lead me to the rock  That's high above my head,  And make the covert of thy wings  My shelter and my shade.    3 Within thy presence, Lord,  For ever I'll abide;  Thou art the tower of my defence,  The refuge where I hide.    4 Thou givest me the lot  Of those that fear thy Name;  If endless life be their reward,  I shall possess the same.      Psalm 62. 5-12.  No trust in the creatures; or,  Faith in divine grace and power.    1 My spirit looks to God alone;  My rock and refuge is his throne;  In all my fears, in all my straits,  My soul on his salvation waits.    2 Trust him, ye saints, in all your ways,  Pour out your hearts before his face:  When helpers fail, and foes invade,  God is our all-sufficient aid.    3 False are the men of high degree,  The baser sort are vanity;  Laid in the balance both appear  Light as a puff of empty air.    4 Make not increasing gold your trust,  Nor set your heart on glittering dust;  Why will you grasp the fleeting smoke;  And not believe what God hath spoke?    5 Once has his awful voice declar'd,  Once and again my ears have heard,  \"All power is his eternal due;  \"He must be fear'd and trusted too.\"    6 For sovereign power reigns not alone,  Grace is a partner of the throne:  Thy grace and justice, mighty Lord,  Shall well divide our last reward.      Psalm 63:1. 1 2 5 34. First Part. C. M.  The morning of a Lord's day.    1 Early, my God, without delay  I haste to seek thy face;  My thirsty spirit faints away,  Without thy cheering grace.    2 So pilgrims on the scorching sand,  Beneath a burning sky,  Long for a cooling stream at hand,  And they must drink or die.    3 I've seen thy glory and thy power  Thro' all thy temple shine;  My God, repeat that heavenly hour,  That vision so divine.    4 Not all the blessings of a feast  Can please my soul so well,  As when thy richer grace I taste,  And in thy presence dwell.    5 Not life itself with all her joys,  Can my best passions move,  Or raise so high my cheerful voice  As thy forgiving love.    6 Thus till my last expiring day  I'll bless my God and King;  Thus will I lift my hands to pray,  And tune my lips to sing.      Psalm 63:2. 6-10. Second Part.  Midnight thoughts recollected.    1 'Twas in the watches of the night  I thought upon thy power,  I kept thy lovely face in sight  Amidst the darkest hour.    2 My flesh lay resting on my bed,  My soul arose on high;  \"My God, my life, my hope,\" I said,  \"Bring thy salvation nigh.\"    3 My spirit labours up thine hill,  And climbs the heavenly road;  But thy right hand upholds me still,  While I pursue my God.    4 Thy mercy stretches o'er my head  The shadow of thy wings;  My heart rejoices in thine aid,  My tongue awakes and sings.    5 But the destroyers of my peace  Shall fret and rage in vain;  The tempter shall for ever cease,  And all my sins be slain.    6 Thy sword shall give my foes to death,  And send them down to dwell  In the dark caverns of the earth,  Or to the deeps of hell.      Psalm 63:3. L. M.  Longing after God; or, The  love of God better than life.    1 Great God, indulge my humble claim  Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest;  The glories that compose thy Name  Stand all engag'd to make me blest.    2 Thou great and good, thou just and wise,  Thou art my Father and my God;  And I am thine by sacred ties;  Thy son, thy servant bought with blood.    3 With heart, and eyes and lifted hands,  For thee I long, to thee I look,  As travellers in thirsty lands  Pant for the cooling water-brook.    4 With early feet I love t' appear  Among thy saints and seek thy face;  Oft have I seen thy glory there,  And felt the power of sovereign grace.    5 Not fruits nor wines that tempt our taste,  Not all the joys our senses know,  Could make me so divinely blest  Or raise my cheerful passions so.    6 My life itself without thy love  No taste of pleasure could afford;  'Twould but a tiresome burden prove,  If I were banish'd from the Lord.    7 Amidst the wakeful hours of night,  When busy cares afflict my head  One thought of thee gives new delight,  And adds refreshment to my bed.    8 I'll lift my hands, I'll raise my voice,  While I have breath to pray or praise;  This work shall make my heart rejoice,  And spend the remnant of my days.      Psalm 63:4. S. M.  Seeking God.    1 My God, permit my tongue  This joy, to call thee mine,  And let my early cries prevail  To taste thy love divine.    2 My thirsty fainting soul  Thy mercy doth implore;  Not travellers in desert lands  Can pant for water more.    3 Within thy churches, Lord,  I long to find my place,  Thy power and glory to behold,  And feel thy quickening grace.    4 For life without thy love  No relish can afford;  No joy can be compar'd to this,  To serve and please the Lord.    5 To thee I'll lift my hands,  And praise thee while I live;  Not the rich dainties of a feast  Such food or pleasure give.    6 In wakeful hours at night  I call my God to mind;  I think how wise thy counsels are,  And all thy dealings kind.    7 Since thou hast been my help,  To thee my spirit flies,  And on thy watchful providence  My cheerful hope relies.    8 The shadow of thy wings  My soul in safety keeps;  I follow where my Father leads,  And he supports my steps.      Psalm 65:1. 1-5. First Part. L. M.  Public prayer and praise.    1 The praise of Sion waits for thee,  My God; and praise becomes thy house;  There shall thy saints thy glory see,  And there perform their public vows.    2 O thou, whose mercy bends the skies  To save when humble sinners pray,  All lands to thee shall lift their eyes  And islands of the northern sea.    3 Against my will my sins prevail,  But grace shall purge away their stain;  The blood of Christ will never fail  To wash my garments white again.    4 Blest is the man whom thou shalt choose,  And give him kind access to thee,  Give him a place within thy house,  To taste thy love divinely free.    PAUSE.    5 Let Babel fear when Sion prays;  Babel, prepare for long distress  When Sion's God himself arrays  In terror, and in righteousness.    6 With dreadful glory God fulfils  What his afflicted saints request;  And with almighty wrath reveals  His love to give his churches rest.    7 Then shall the flocking nations run  To Sion's hill, and own their Lord;  The rising and the setting sun  Shall see their Saviour's name ador'd.      Psalm 65:2. 5-13. Second Part. L. M.  Divine providence in air, earth, and sea;  or, The God of nature and grace.    1 The God of our salvation hears  The groans of Sion mix'd with tears;  Yet when he comes with kind designs,  Thro' all the way his terror shines.    2 On him the race of man depends,  Far as the earth's remotest ends,  Where the Creator's Name is known  By nature's feeble light alone.    3 Sailors, that travel o'er the flood,  Address their frighted souls to God;  When tempests rage and billows roar  At dreadful distance from the shore.    4 He bids the noisy tempest cease;  He calms the raging crowd to peace,  When a tumultuous nation raves  Wild as the winds, and loud as waves.    5 Whole kingdoms shaken by the storm  He settles in a peaceful form;  Mountains establish'd by his hand,  Firm on their old foundations stand.    6 Behold his ensigns sweep the sky,  New comets blaze and lightnings fly,  The heathen lands, with swift surprise,  From the bright horrors turn their eyes.    7 At his command the morning-ray  Smiles in the east, and leads the day;  He guides the sun's declining wheels  Over the tops of western hills.    8 Seasons and times obey his voice;  The evening and the morn rejoice  To see the earth made soft with showers,  Laden with fruit and drest in flowers.    9 'Tis from his watery stores on high  He gives the thirsty ground supply;  He walks upon the clouds, and thence  Doth his enriching drops dispense.    10 The desert grows a fruitful field,  Abundant food the vallies yield;  The vallies shout with cheerful voice,  And neighb'ring hills repeat their joys.    11 The pastures smile in green array;  There lambs and larger cattle play;  The larger cattle and the lamb  Each in his language speaks thy Name.    12 Thy works pronounce thy power divine,  O'er every field thy glories shine;  Thro' every month thy gifts appear;  Great God! thy goodness crowns the year.      Psalm 65:3. First Part. C. M.  A prayer-hearing God, and the Gentiles called.    1 Praise waits in Sion, Lord, for thee;  There shall our vows be paid:  Thou hast an ear when sinners pray,  All flesh shall seek thine aid.    2 Lord, our iniquities prevail,  But pardoning grace is thine,  And thou wilt grant us power and skill  To conquer every sin.    3 Bless'd are the men whom thou wilt choose  To bring them near thy face,  Give them a dwelling in thine house  To feast upon thy grace.    4 In answering what thy church requests  Thy truth and terror shine,  And works of dreadful righteousness  Fulfil thy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],[0,"True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#16)"],[1," a sick wife and baby, unfitted by training or ability for  any sort of lucrative employment, a hanger-on of bucket shops and, in  his palmiest days, a speculator in tiny lots of feebly margined stocks,  finding himself without means of support, conceived the alluring idea of  soliciting funds for investment, promising enormous interest, and paying  this interest out of the principal intrusted to him. For a time he  preyed only upon his friends, claiming \"inside information\" of large  \"deals\" and paying ten per cent. per week on the money received out of  his latest deposits.    Surely the history of civilization is a history of credulity. Miller  prospered. His earlier friend-customers who had hesitatingly taken his  receipt for ten dollars, and thereafter had received one dollar every  Monday morning, repeated the operation and returned in ever-increasing  numbers. From having his office \"in his hat,\" he took an upper room in a  small two-story house at 144 Floyd Street, Brooklyn--an humble tenement,  destined to be the scene of one of the most extraordinary exhibitions of  man's cupidity and foolishness in modern times. At first he had tramped  round, like a pedler, delivering the dividends himself and soliciting  more, but soon he hired a boy. This was in February, 1899. Business  increased. The golden flood began to appear in an attenuated but  constant rivulet. He hired four more employees and the whole top floor  of the house. The golden rivulet became a steady stream. From a  \"panhandler\" he rolled in ready thousands. The future opened into  magnificent auriferous distances. He began to call himself \"The Franklin  Syndicate,\" and to advertise that \"the way to wealth is as plain as the  road to the market.\" He copied the real brokers and scattered circulars  and \"weekly letters\" over the country, exciting the rural mind in  distant Manitoba and Louisiana.    There was an instantaneous response. His mail required the exclusive  attention of several clerks. The stream of gold became a rushing  torrent. Every Monday morning the Floyd Street house was crowded with  depositors who drew their interest, added to it, deposited it again, and  went upon their way rejoicing. Nobody was going to have to work any  more. The out-of-town customers received checks for their interest drawn  upon \"The Franklin Syndicate,\" together with printed receipts for their  deposits, all signed \"William F. Miller,\" by means of a rubber stamp. No  human hand could have signed them all without writer's cramp. The  rubber stamp was Miller's official signature. Then with a mighty roar  the torrent burst into a deluge. The Floyd Street quarters were besieged  by a clamoring multitude fighting to see which of them could give up his  money first, and there had to be a special delivery for Miller's mail.  He rented the whole house and hired fifty clerks. You could deposit your  money almost anywhere, from the parlor to the pantry, the clothes closet  or the bath-room. Fridays the public stormed the house _en masse_, since  the money must be deposited _on that day_ to draw interest for the  following week. The crush was so enormous that the stoop broke down.  Imagine it! In quiet Brooklyn! People struggling to get up the steps to  cram their money into Miller's pockets! There he sat, behind a desk, at  the top of the stoop, solemnly taking the money thrown down before him  and handing out little pink and green stamped receipts in exchange.  There was no place to put the money, so it was shoved on to the floor  behind him. Friday afternoons Miller and his clerks waded through it,  knee high. There was no pretense of bookkeeping. Simply in self-defense  Miller issued in October a pronunciamento that he could not in justice  to his business, consent to receive less than fifty dollars at one time.  Theoretically, there was no reason why the thing should not have gone  on practically forever, Miller and everybody else becoming richer and  richer. So long as the golden stream swelled five times each year  everybody would be happy. How could anybody fail to be happy who saw so  much money lying around loose everywhere?    [Illustration: One of Miller's Franklin Syndicate Receipts.]    But the business had increased to such an extent that Miller began to  distrust his own capacity to handle it. He therefore secured a partner  in the person of one Edward Schlessinger, and with him went to  Charlestown, Mass., for the purpose of opening another office, in charge  of which they placed a man named Louis Powers. History repeated itself.  Powers shipped the deposits to Miller every day or two by express. Was  there ever such a plethora of easy money?    But Schlessinger was no Miller. He decided that he must have a third of  the profits (Heaven knows how they computed them!) and have them,  moreover, each day _in cash_. Hence there was a daily accounting, part  of the receipts being laid aside to pay off interest checks and  interest, and the balance divided. Schlessinger carried his off in a  bag; Miller took the rest, cash, money orders and checks, and deposited  it in a real bank. How the money poured in may be realized from the fact  that the excess of receipts over disbursements for the month ending  November 16th was four hundred and thirty thousand dollars.    Hitherto Miller had been the central figure. Col. Robert A. Ammon now  became the _deus ex machina_. Miller's advertising had become so  extensive that he had been forced to retain a professional agent, one  Rudolph Guenther, to supervise it, and when the newspapers began to make  unpleasant comments, Guenther took Miller to Ammon's office in the  Bennett Building in Nassau Street. Ammon accepted a hundred dollars from  Miller, listened to his account of the business and examined copies of  the circulars. When he was handed one of the printed receipts he said  they were \"incriminating.\" Miller must try to get them back. He advised  (as many another learned counsellor has done) incorporating the  business, since by this means stock could be sold and exchanged for the  incriminating receipts. He explained the mistakes of the \"_Dean_ crowd,\"  but showed how he had been able to safeguard them in spite of the fact  that they had foolishly insisted on holding the stock in their company  themselves instead of making their customers the stockholders.  Nevertheless \"you do not see any of the Dean people in jail,\" boasted  Ammon. From now on Miller and he were in frequent consultation, and  Ammon took steps to incorporate, procuring for that purpose from Wells,  Fargo & Co. a certificate of deposit for one hundred thousand dollars.  Occasionally he would visit Floyd Street to see how things were going.  Miller became a mere puppet; Ammon twitched the wire.    It was now well on in November, and the press of both Boston and New  York was filled with scathing attacks upon the Syndicate. The reporters  became so inquisitive as to be annoying to the peaceful Miller. \"Send  the reporters over to me!\" directed Ammon.    The _Post_ (of Boston) said the whole thing was a miserable swindle.  Ammon, accompanied by Miller, carrying a satchel which contained fifty  thousand dollars in greenbacks, went to Boston, visited the offices of  the _Post_, and pitched into the editor.    \"The business is all right; you must give us a fair deal!\"    The pair also visited Watts, the chief of police.    \"You keep your mouth shut,\" said Ammon to Miller. \"I'll do all the  talking.\" He showed Watts the bag of money, and demanded what he had  meant by calling the enterprise a \"green goods business.\" If the thing  wasn't all right, did Watts suppose that he, Col. Robert A. Ammon, would  be connected with it? The chief backed down, and explained that he had  jokingly referred to the color of one of the receipts--which happened  to be green.    In spite of Ammon's confidence, however, there was an uneasy feeling in  the air, and it was decided to put an advertisement in the _Post_  offering to allow any customer who so desired to withdraw his deposit,  _without notice_, upon the following Saturday. This announcement did not  have precisely the anticipated effect, and Saturday saw a large crowd of  victims eager to withdraw their money from the Boston office of the  Franklin Syndicate. Powers paid the \"_Pauls_,\" of Boston, out of the bag  brought on by Miller containing the deposits of the \"_Peters_,\" of  Brooklyn. Meantime, Ammon addressed the throng, incidentally  blackguarding a _Post_ reporter before the crowd, telling them that his  paper was a \"yellow paper, had never amounted to anything, and never  would.\" Some timid souls took courage and redeposited their money. The  run continued one day and cost Ammon and Miller about twenty-eight  thousand dollars. Ammon took five thousand dollars cash as a fee out of  the bag, and the pair returned to New York. But confidence had been  temporarily restored.    The beginning of the end, however, was now in sight--at least for the  keen vision of Bob Ammon. He advised stimulating deposits and laying  hands on all the money possible before the crash came. Accordingly  Miller sent a telegram (collect) to all depositors:        We have inside information of a big transaction, to begin Saturday      or Monday morning. Big profits. Remit at once so as to receive the      profits.        WILLIAM F. MILLER,        Franklin Syndicate.    A thousand or so were returned, the depositors having refused to pay the  charges. The rest of the customers in large measure responded. But the  game was nearly up. There were scare-heads in the papers. Miller saw  detectives on every corner, and, like a rat leaving a sinking ship,  Schlessinger scuttled away for the last time with a bag of money on the  evening of Tuesday, November 21st, 1899. The rest of the deposits were  crammed into Miller's desk and left there over night.    The next morning Miller returned to Floyd Street and spent that day in  the"]]]
