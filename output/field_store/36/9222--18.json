His advice was again taken when it was necessary to settle upon what  plan the young Prince of Wales should be educated.    Stockmar's judgment of men was singularly correct and just. He formed  the highest opinion of Sir Robert Peel, and on the Duke of  Wellington's death in 1852 he wrote in a letter to the Prince a  masterly analysis of the great commander's character, concluding  with these words: \"As the times we live in cannot fail to present  your Royal Highness with great and worthy occasions to distinguish  yourself, you should not shrink from turning them to account . . .  as Wellington did, for the good of all, yet without detriment to  yourself.\"    The Prince corresponded regularly with 'the good Stockmar,' and  always in time of doubt and trial came sage counsel from his trusted  friend. In fact, the Prince took both the Queen and his friend equally  into his confidence; they were the two to whom he could unbosom  himself with entire freedom.    Disraeli, afterward Lord Beaconsfield, obtained the Queen's fullest  confidence and won her friendship to an extent which no Minister  since Melbourne had ever been able to do. 'Dizzy,' the leader of the  'Young England' party, the writer of political novels, was a very  different person from the statesman of later years. It is difficult  to remember or to realize in these days that it was looked upon as  something quite extraordinary for a member of a once despised and  persecuted race, the Jews, to hold high office. The annual  celebrations of 'Primrose Day,' April 19, the anniversary of his  death, are sufficient proof that this great statesman's services to  the British Empire are not yet forgotten.    Lord Beaconsfield, whom she regarded with sincere affection,  possessed a remarkable influence over the Queen, for the simple  reason that he never forgot to treat her as a woman. He was noted  throughout his life for his chivalry to the opposite sex, and his  devotion to his wife was very touching.    He was a firm believer in the power of the Crown for good. \"The proper  leader of the people,\" he declared, \"is the individual who sits upon  the throne.\" He wished the Sovereign to be in a position to rule as  well as to reign, to be at one with the nation, above the quarrels  and differences of the political parties, and to be their  representative.    When quite a young man, he declared that he would one day be Prime  Minister, and with this end in view he entered Parliament against  the wishes of his family. He was an untiring worker all his life,  and a firm believer in action. \"Act, act, act without ceasing, and  you will no longer talk of the vanity of life,\" was his creed.    His ideas on education were original, and he did everything in his  power to improve the training of the young. In 1870 he supported the  great measure for a scheme of national education. Some years earlier  he declared that \"it is an absolute necessity that we should study  to make every man the most effective being that education can  possibly constitute him. In the old wars there used to be a story  that one Englishman could beat three members of some other nation.  But I think if we want to maintain our power, we ought to make one  Englishman equal really in the business of life to three other men  that any other nation can furnish. I do not see otherwise how . . .  we can fulfil the great destiny that I believe awaits us, and the  great position we occupy.\"    He did more than any other Minister to raise the Crown to the position  it now occupies, and no monarch ever had a more devoted and faithful  servant. His high standard of morals and his force of character  especially appealed to the English people, and his loyalty to his  friends and colleagues remained unshaken throughout his whole life.  He impressed not only his own countrymen, but also foreigners, with  his splendid gifts of imagination and foresight.    Bismarck, the man of 'blood and iron,' who welded the disunited  states of Germany into a united and powerful empire, considered that  Queen Victoria was the greatest statesman in Europe, and of the great  Beaconsfield he said: \"Disraeli _is_ England.\"    Disraeli was a master of wit and phrase, and many of his best sayings  and definitions have become proverbial, _e.g._ \"the hansom, the  'gondola' of London,\" \"our young Queen and our old institutions,\"  \"critics, men who have failed,\" \"books, the curse of the human race.\"    [Illustration: Sir Robert Peel, Lord Melbourne, Benjamin Disraeli  Photo W.A. Mansell & Co.]    The central figure of his time was the statesman-warrior, the great  Duke of Wellington, '_the_ Duke.' After the famous Marlborough,  England had not been able to boast of such a great commander. He was  the best known figure in London, and though he never courted  popularity or distinction, yet he served his Queen as Prime Minister  when desired. \"The path of duty\" was for him \"the way to glory.\" In  1845 the greatest wish of his life was realized when the Queen and  her husband paid him a two days' visit at his residence,  Strathfieldsaye.    Alfred Tennyson's \"Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington,\" in  1852, praises him as 'truth-teller' and 'truth-lover,' and mourns  for him:        Let the long, long procession go,      And let the sorrowing crowd about it grow,      And let the mournful, martial music blow;      The last great Englishman is low.    In striking contrast to the 'Iron Duke' was the man whom Disraeli  could never learn to like, Lord John Russell. Generally depicted in  the pages of _Punch_ as a pert, cocksure little fellow, 'little  Johnny,' the leader of the Whig party was a power as a leader. He  knew how to interpret the Queen's wishes in a manner agreeable to  herself, yet he did not hesitate, when he thought it advisable, to  speak quite freely in criticism of her actions.    His ancestors in the Bedford family had in olden days been advisers  of the Crown, and Lord John thus came of a good stock; he himself,  nevertheless, was always alert to prevent any encroachment upon the  growing powers and rights of the people.    He was a favourite of the Queen, and she gave him as a residence a  house and grounds in Richmond Park. He was a man of the world and  an agreeable talker, very well read, fond of quoting poetry, and  especially pleased if he could indulge in reminiscences in his own  circle of what his royal mistress had said at her last visit.    Finally, mention must be made of one who, though he held no high  position of State, can with justice be regarded as both friend and  adviser of the Queen--John Brown. He entered the Queen's service at  Balmoral, became later a gillie to the Prince Consort, and in 1851  the Queen's personal outdoor attendant. He was a man of a very  straightforward nature and blunt speech, and even his Royal Mistress  was not safe at times from criticism. In spite of his rough manner,  he possessed many admirable qualities, and on his death in 1883 the  Queen caused a granite seat to be erected in the grounds of Osborne  with the following inscription:        A TRUER, NOBLER, TRUSTIER HEART, MORE LOVING          AND MORE LOYAL, NEVER BEAT WITHIN              A HUMAN BREAST.          CHAPTER XIII: _Queen and Empire_    What should they know of England who only England know?      The England of Queen Elizabeth was the England of Shakespeare:        This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,      This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,      This other Eden, demi-paradise;      This fortress built by Nature for herself      Against infection and the hand of war;      This happy breed of men, this little world,      This precious stone set in the silver sea,      Which serves it in the office of a wall,      Or as a moat defensive to a house,      Against the envy of less happier lands;      This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.    In Tennyson's _Princess_ we find an echo of these words, where the  poet, in contrasting England and France, monarchy and republic--much  to the disadvantage of the latter--says:        God bless the narrow sea which keeps her off,      And keeps our Britain, whole within herself,      A nation yet, the rulers and the ruled.    But at a later date, in an \"Epilogue to the Queen,\" at the close of  the _Idylls of the King_, Tennyson has said farewell to his narrow  insular views, and speaks of        Our ocean-empire with her boundless homes      For ever-broadening England, and her throne      In our vast Orient, and one isle, one isle,      That knows not her own greatness: if she knows      And dreads it we are fall'n.    He had come to recognize the necessity for guarding and maintaining  the Empire, with all its greatness and all its burdens, as part of  this country's destiny.    It is a little difficult to realize that the British Empire, as we  now know it, has been created within only the last hundred years.  Beaconsfield, in his novel _Contarini Fleming_, describes the  difference between ancient and modern colonies. \"A modern colony,\"  he says, \"is a commercial enterprise, an ancient colony was a  political sentiment.\" In other words, colonies were a matter of  'cash' to modern nations, such as the Spaniards: in the time of the  ancients there was a close tie, a feeling of kinship, and the colonist  was not looked upon with considerable contempt and dislike by the  Mother Country.    Beaconsfield believed that there would come a time, and that not far  distant, when men would change their ideas. \"I believe that a great  revolution is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16972"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 711, August 17, 1889 (#16)"],[1,"of thesis by E.A. Partridge, class of     '89, Univ. of Pa. Read before the Chemical Section of the     Franklin Institute by Prof. S.P. Sadtler.]      It is well known that the paraffine obtained by the distillation of  petroleum residues is crystalline, while that obtained directly (as in  the filtration of residuum) is amorphous. Ozokerite or ceresine  differs but slightly from paraffine, the principal distinction being  want of crystalline structure in it as found. Other characteristics,  such as the melting point, specific gravity, etc., vary in both, and  so are not of importance in a comparison. Hence it has been asked, Is  the paraffine occurring in petroleum and ozokerite identical with that  which is produced by their distillation? As crystalline paraffine  could be obtained from ozokerite by distillation alone, many persons  have supposed that it was engendered in the process. Recently,  however, crystalline paraffine has been obtained from ozokerite by  dissolving the latter in warm amyl alcohol; on cooling the greater  part separates out in crystals having the luster of mother-of-pearl.  By repetition of this process, a substance is obtained that is  scarcely to be distinguished from the paraffine obtained by  distillation. Apparently there exists then in ozokerite, together with  paraffine, other substances not capable of crystallization which keep  the paraffine from crystallizing. These colloids appear to be  separated by amyl alcohol in virtue of their greater solubility in  that menstruum. It is also reasonable to suppose that they undergo  change or decomposition by distillation.    So as petroleum residues are amorphous, and the crystalline paraffine  is first produced by distillation, it has been argued that the  paraffine present in crude petroleum is approximately the same thing  as ozokerite.    This, however, is not sufficient to establish the pyrogenic origin of  all crystallized paraffine, as crystals can be obtained from the  amorphous residues by distillation at normal or reduced pressure or in  a current of steam. To explain these facts two assumptions are  possible. Either the chemical and physical properties of all or some  of the solid constituents are changed by the distillation, and the  paraffine is changed from the amorphous into the crystalline variety,  or the change produced by the distillation takes place in the medium  (i.e., the mother liquid) in which the paraffine exists. The change  effected in ozokerite and in petroleum residues when crystalline  paraffine is obtained by distillation is to be regarded as a  purification, and can be effected partially by treatment with amyl  alcohol. In the same way, by repeated treatment of petroleum residuum  with amyl alcohol, a substance of melting point 59 deg. C. can be  obtained, which cannot be distinguished from ordinary paraffine.    The treatment with amyl alcohol has therefore accomplished the same  results as was obtained by distillation, and the action is probably  the same, i.e., a partial separation of colloid substance. These  facts point to the conclusion that crystallizable paraffine exists  ready formed in both petroleum and in ozokerite, but in both cases  other colloidal substances prevent its crystallization. By  distillation, these colloids appear to be destroyed or changed so as  to allow the paraffine to crystallize.    It is a generally known fact that liquids always appear among the  products of the distillation of paraffine, no matter in what way the  distillation be conducted. This shows that some paraffine is  decomposed in the operation.    The name _proto-paraffine_ has been given to ozokerite and to the  paraffine of petroleum in contradistinction to _pyro-paraffine_, the  name that has been applied to the paraffine obtained by distillation  from any source.    According to Reichenbach, paraffine may crystallize in three forms:  needles, angular grains, and leaflets having the luster of  mother-of-pearl. Hofstadter, in an article on the identity of  paraffine from different sources, confirmed this statement, and added  further that at first needles, then the angular forms, and then the  leaflets are formed. Fritsche found, by means of the microscope, in  the ethereal solution of ozokerite, very fine and thin crystal  leaflets concentrically grouped, and in the alcoholic solution fine  irregular leaflets. Zaloziecki has recently developed these  microscopic investigations to a much greater extent. According to this  observer, the principal part of paraffine, as seen under the  microscope, consists of shining stratified leaflets with a darker  edge. The most characteristic and well developed crystals are formed  by dissolving paraffine in a mixture of ethyl and amyl alcohols and  chilling. The crystals are rhombic or hexagonal tablets or leaves, and  are quite regularly formed. They are unequally developed in different  varieties of paraffine. The best developed are those obtained from  ceresine. Their relative size and appearance give an indication as to  the purity of the paraffine, and, as they are always present, they are  to be counted among the characteristic tests for paraffine.  Reichenbach observed that mere traces of empyreumatic oil prevented  their formation.    The old method of determining the amount of paraffine in petroleum was  to carry out the refining process on a small scale; that is, to  distill the residue from the kerosene oils to coking, chill out the  paraffine, press it thoroughly between filter paper, and weigh the  residue. The sources of error in this procedure are manifold; the  principal one is the solubility of paraffine in oils, which depends  upon the character of both the paraffine and the oil, and also upon  the temperature. The next greatest source of error is variation in the  process of distillation and the difference between working on the  small scale and on the large scale.    In most cases, where a paraffine determination is to be carried out,  one has to deal with a mixture of paraffine with liquid oils. Now,  paraffine is not a substance defined by characteristic physical  properties which distinguish it from the liquid portions of petroleum.  It consists of a mixture of homologous hydrocarbons, which form a  solid under ordinary conditions. The hydrocarbons of this mixture show  a gradation in their properties, and gradually approximate to those  which are liquid at ordinary temperatures. It is a well known fact  that a separation of these homologues is entirely impossible by  distillation. It has also been ascertained that the liquid  constituents of petroleum do not always possess boiling points that  are lower than those of the solid constituents. This shows that we  have to deal not merely with hydrocarbons of one, but of several  series.    When determinations of the amount of paraffine are to be made, then it  becomes necessary to specify with exactness what is to be called  paraffine. The most definite property that can be made use of for this  purpose is the melting point. For several reasons it is convenient to  include under this name hydrocarbons of melting point as low as  35 deg.-40 deg. C.    The method proposed by Zaloziecki for the determination of paraffine  is the following: The most volatile portions of the petroleum are  separated by distillation, until the thermometer shows 200 deg. C. These  portions are separated, as they exert great solvent action upon  paraffine. At the same time he finds that no pyro-paraffine is formed  under this temperature. A weighed portion of the residue is taken and  mixed with ten parts by weight of amyl alcohol and ten parts of  seventy-five per cent. ethyl alcohol: the mixture is then chilled for  twelve hours to 0 deg. C. It is then filtered cold, washed first with a  mixture of amyl and ethyl alcohols, and then with ethyl alcohol alone.  The paraffine is transferred to a small porcelain evaporating dish and  dried at 110 deg. C. It is then heated with concentrated sulphuric acid to  150 deg.-160 deg. C. for fifteen to thirty minutes with constant stirring. The  acid is then neutralized and the paraffine extracted by petroleum  ether. On evaporation of the solvent, the paraffine is dried at 100 deg.  C. and weighed. Zaloziecki found, according to this method, in three  samples of Galician petroleums, 4.6, 5.8 and 6.5 per cent.,  respectively, of proto-paraffine. The method was carried out as above  with four samples of American petroleums, Colorado oil from Florence,  Col.; Warren County oil from Wing Well, Warren, Pa.; Washington oil  from Washington County, Pa.; Middle District oil from Butler County,  Pa., all furnished by Professor Sadtler.    They were very different in physical properties and in appearance, the  Colorado oil being a much heavier oil than the others and the  Washington oil being an amber oil, while the other two were of the  ordinary dark green color and consistence. The losses on distillation  to 200 deg. C. were very different, being about one-tenth in the case of  the Colorado oil and nearly one-half in the case of the others. The  percentages of partially refined proto-paraffine in the four reduced  oils (all below 200 deg. C. off) were as follows: for the Colorado oil,  23.9 per cent.; for the Warren oil, 26.5 per cent.; for the Washington  oil, 26.6 per cent.; and for the Middle District oil, 28.2 per cent.    The question now arises, What value has this determination of the  proto-paraffine which may exist in an oil? As before said, a portion  of the paraffine is always decomposed in distillation at temperatures  sufficiently high to drive over the paraffine oils, so the yield of  pyro-paraffine is always less than the proto-paraffine shown to be  present originally. Zaloziecki found this in the case of the several  Galician oils he examined. Corresponding to the 4.6, 5.8 and 6.5 per  cent. of proto-paraffine in the several oils he obtained 2.18, 2.65  and 2.35 per"]]]
