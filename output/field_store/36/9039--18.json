I'll come to you and confess,\" Jane replied,  lightly; but she felt the undercurrent of her words.    \"Mormon love-making!\" exclaimed the Bishop, rubbing his hands. \"Tull  keeps you all to himself.\"    \"No. He is not courting me.\"    \"What? The laggard! If he does not make haste I'll go a-courting myself  up to Withersteen House.\"    There was laughter and further bantering by the Bishop, and then mild  talk of village affairs, after which he took his leave, and Jane was  left with her friend, Mary Brandt.    \"Jane, you're not yourself. Are you sad about the rustling of the  cattle? But you have so many, you are so rich.\"    Then Jane confided in her, telling much, yet holding back her doubts of  fear.    \"Oh, why don't you marry Tull and be one of us?    \"But, Mary, I don't love Tull,\" said Jane, stubbornly.    \"I don't blame you for that. But, Jane Withersteen, you've got to choose  between the love of man and love of God. Often we Mormon women have to  do that. It's not easy. The kind of happiness you want I wanted once. I  never got it, nor will you, unless you throw away your soul. We've all  watched your affair with Venters in fear and trembling. Some dreadful  thing will come of it. You don't want him hanged or shot--or treated  worse, as that Gentile boy was treated in Glaze for fooling round a  Mormon woman. Marry Tull. It's your duty as a Mormon. You'll feel no  rapture as his wife--but think of Heaven! Mormon women don't marry for  what they expect on earth. Take up the cross, Jane. Remember your father  found Amber Spring, built these old houses, brought Mormons here, and  fathered them. You are the daughter of Withersteen!\"    Jane left Mary Brandt and went to call upon other friends. They received  her with the same glad welcome as had Mary, lavished upon her the  pent-up affection of Mormon women, and let her go with her ears ringing  of Tull, Venters, Lassiter, of duty to God and glory in Heaven.    \"Verily,\" murmured Jane, \"I don't know myself when, through all this, I  remain unchanged--nay, more fixed of purpose.\"    She returned to the main street and bent her thoughtful steps toward the  center of the village. A string of wagons drawn by oxen was lumbering  along. These \"sage-freighters,\" as they were called, hauled grain and  flour and merchandise from Sterling, and Jane laughed suddenly in the  midst of her humility at the thought that they were her property, as was  one of the three stores for which they freighted goods. The water that  flowed along the path at her feet, and turned into each cottage-yard to  nourish garden and orchard, also was hers, no less her private property  because she chose to give it free. Yet in this village of Cottonwoods,  which her father had founded and which she maintained she was not her  own mistress; she was not able to abide by her own choice of a husband.  She was the daughter of Withersteen. Suppose she proved it, imperiously!  But she quelled that proud temptation at its birth.    Nothing could have replaced the affection which the village people had  for her; no power could have made her happy as the pleasure her presence  gave. As she went on down the street past the stores with their rude  platform entrances, and the saloons where tired horses stood with  bridles dragging, she was again assured of what was the bread and wine  of life to her--that she was loved. Dirty boys playing in the ditch,  clerks, teamsters, riders, loungers on the corners, ranchers on dusty  horses, little girls running errands, and women hurrying to the stores  all looked up at her coming with glad eyes.    Jane's various calls and wandering steps at length led her to the  Gentile quarter of the village. This was at the extreme southern end,  and here some thirty Gentile families lived in huts and shacks and  log-cabins and several dilapidated cottages. The fortunes of these  inhabitants of Cottonwoods could be read in their abodes. Water they had  in abundance, and therefore grass and fruit-trees and patches of alfalfa  and vegetable gardens. Some of the men and boys had a few stray cattle,  others obtained such intermittent employment as the Mormons reluctantly  tendered them. But none of the families was prosperous, many were very  poor, and some lived only by Jane Withersteen's beneficence.    As it made Jane happy to go among her own people, so it saddened her to  come in contact with these Gentiles. Yet that was not because she was  unwelcome; here she was gratefully received by the women, passionately  by the children. But poverty and idleness, with their attendant  wretchedness and sorrow, always hurt her. That she could alleviate this  distress more now than ever before proved the adage that it was an ill  wind that blew nobody good. While her Mormon riders were in her employ  she had found few Gentiles who would stay with her, and now she was able  to find employment for all the men and boys. No little shock was it to  have man after man tell her that he dare not accept her kind offer.    \"It won't do,\" said one Carson, an intelligent man who had seen better  days. \"We've had our warning. Plain and to the point! Now there's  Judkins, he packs guns, and he can use them, and so can the daredevil  boys he's hired. But they've little responsibility. Can we risk having  our homes burned in our absence?\"    Jane felt the stretching and chilling of the skin of her face as the  blood left it.    \"Carson, you and the others rent these houses?\" she asked.    \"You ought to know, Miss Withersteen. Some of them are yours.\"    \"I know?... Carson, I never in my life took a day's labor for rent or a  yearling calf or a bunch of grass, let alone gold.\"    \"Bivens, your store-keeper, sees to that.\"    \"Look here, Carson,\" went on Jane, hurriedly, and now her cheeks  were burning. \"You and Black and Willet pack your goods and move your  families up to my cabins in the grove. They're far more comfortable than  these. Then go to work for me. And if aught happens to you there I'll  give you money--gold enough to leave Utah!\"    The man choked and stammered, and then, as tears welled into his eyes,  he found the use of his tongue and cursed. No gentle speech could ever  have equaled that curse in eloquent expression of what he felt for Jane  Withersteen. How strangely his look and tone reminded her of Lassiter!    \"No, it won't do,\" he said, when he had somewhat recovered himself.  \"Miss Withersteen, there are things that you don't know, and there's not  a soul among us who can tell you.\"    \"I seem to be learning many things, Carson. Well, then, will you let me  aid you--say till better times?\"    \"Yes, I will,\" he replied, with his face lighting up. \"I see what it  means to you, and you know what it means to me. Thank you! And if better  times ever come, I'll be only too happy to work for you.\"    \"Better times will come. I trust God and have faith in man. Good day,  Carson.\"    The lane opened out upon the sage-inclosed alfalfa fields, and the last  habitation, at the end of that lane of hovels, was the meanest.  Formerly it had been a shed; now it was a home. The broad leaves of a  wide-spreading cottonwood sheltered the sunken roof of weathered boards.  Like an Indian hut, it had one floor. Round about it were a few scanty  rows of vegetables, such as the hand of a weak woman had time and  strength to cultivate. This little dwelling-place was just outside the  village limits, and the widow who lived there had to carry her water  from the nearest irrigation ditch. As Jane Withersteen entered the  unfenced yard a child saw her, shrieked with joy, and came tearing  toward her with curls flying. This child was a little girl of four  called Fay. Her name suited her, for she was an elf, a sprite, a  creature so fairy-like and beautiful that she seemed unearthly.    \"Muvver sended for oo,\" cried Fay, as Jane kissed her, \"an' oo never  tome.\"    \"I didn't know, Fay; but I've come now.\"    Fay was a child of outdoors, of the garden and ditch and field, and she  was dirty and ragged. But rags and dirt did not hide her beauty. The  one thin little bedraggled garment she wore half covered her fine, slim  body. Red as cherries were her cheeks and lips; her eyes were violet  blue, and the crown of her childish loveliness was the curling golden  hair. All the children of Cottonwoods were Jane Withersteen's friends,  she loved them all. But Fay was dearest to her. Fay had few playmates,  for among the Gentile children there were none near her age, and the  Mormon children were forbidden to play with her. So she was a shy, wild,  lonely child.    \"Muvver's sick,\" said Fay, leading Jane toward the door of the hut.    Jane went in. There was only one room, rather dark and bare, but it was  clean and neat. A woman lay upon a bed.    \"Mrs. Larkin, how are you?\" asked Jane, anxiously.    \"I've been pretty bad for a week, but I'm better now.\"    \"You haven't been here all alone--with no one to wait on you?\"    \"Oh no! My women neighbors are kind. They take turns coming in.\"    \"Did you send for me?\"    \"Yes, several times.\"    \"But I had no word--no messages ever got to me.\"    \"I sent the boys, and they left word with your women that I was ill and  would you please come.\"    A sudden deadly sickness seized Jane. She fought the weakness, as she  fought to be above suspicious thoughts, and it passed, leaving her  conscious of her utter impotence. That, too, passed as her spirit  rebounded. But she had again caught a glimpse of dark underhand  domination, running its secret lines this time into her own household.  Like a spider in the blackness of night an unseen hand had begun to run  these dark lines, to turn and twist them about her life, to plait  and weave a web. Jane Withersteen knew it now, and in the realization  further coolness and sureness came to her, and the fighting courage of  her ancestors.    \"Mrs. Larkin, you're better, and I'm so glad,\" said Jane. \"But may I  not do something for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13003"],[0,"Pioneers in Canada (#16)"],[1,"the deer still more, so that they  huddled at last into the final enclosure, where they were so tightly  packed that they were completely at the men's mercy. \"I assure you,\"  writes Champlain, \"there is a singular pleasure in this chase, which  takes place every two days, and has been so successful that in  thirty-eight days one hundred and twenty deer were captured. These  were made good use of, the fat being kept for the winter to be used as  we do butter, and some of the flesh to be taken to their homes for  their festivities.\"    Champlain himself, in the winter of 1615, pursuing one day a  remarkable bird \"which was the size of a hen, had a beak like a parrot  and was entirely yellow, except for a red head and blue wings, and  which had the flight of the partridge\"--a bird I cannot  identify--lost his way in the woods. For two days he wandered in the  wilderness, sustaining himself by shooting birds and roasting them.  But at last he found his way back to a river which he recognized, and  reached the camp of the Hurons, who were extremely delighted at his  return. Had they not found him, or had he not come back of himself,  they told him that they could never again have visited the French for  fear of being held responsible for his death.    By the month of December of this year (1615) the rivers, lakes, and  ponds were all frozen. Hitherto, Champlain had had to walk when he  could not travel in a canoe, and carry a load of twenty pounds, while  the Indians carried a hundred pounds each. But now the water was  frozen the Hurons set to work and made their sledges. These were  constructed of two pieces of board, manufactured from the trunks of  trees by the patient use of a stone axe and by the application of  fire. These boards were about 6 inches wide, and 6 or 7 feet long,  curved upwards at the forward end and bound together by cross pieces.  The sides were bordered with strips of wood, which served as brackets  to which was fastened the strap that bound the baggage upon the  sledge. The load was dragged by a rope or strap of leather passing  round the breast of the Indian, and attached to the end of the sledge.  The sledge was so narrow that it could be drawn easily without  impediment wherever an Indian could thread his way over the snow  through the pathless forests.    The rest of the winter and early spring Champlain spent alone, or in  company with Father Joseph Le Caron (one of the Recollet  missionaries), visiting the Algonkin and Huron tribes in the region  east of Lake Huron. He has left this description of the modern country  of Simcoe, the home, three hundred years ago, of the long-vanished  Hurons[30]; and gives us the following particulars of their home  life. The Huron country was a pleasant land, most of it cleared of  forest. It contained eighteen villages, six of which were enclosed and  fortified by palisades of wood in triple rows, bound together, on the  top of which were galleries provided with stores of stones, and  birch-bark buckets of water; the stones to throw at an enemy, and the  water to extinguish any fire which might be put to the palisades.  These eighteen villages contained about two thousand warriors, and  about thirty thousand people in all. The houses were in the shape of  tunnels, and were thatched with the bark of trees. Each lodge or house  would be about 120 feet long, more or less, and 36 feet wide, with a  10-foot passage-way through the middle from one end to the other. On  either side of the tunnel were placed benches 4 feet high, on which  the people slept in summer in order to avoid the annoyance of the  fleas which swarmed in these habitations. In winter time they slept on  the ground on mats near the fire. In the summer the cabins were filled  with stocks of wood to dry and be ready for burning in winter. At the  end of each of these long houses was a space in which the Indian corn  was preserved in great casks made of the bark of trees. Inside the  long houses pieces of wood were suspended from the roof, on to which  were fastened the clothes, provisions, and other things of the  inmates, to keep them from the attacks of the mice which swarmed in  these villages. Each hut might be inhabited by twenty-four families,  who would maintain twelve fires. The smoke, having no proper means of  egress except at either end of the long dwelling, and through the  chinks of the roof, so injured their eyes during the winter season  that many people lost their sight as they grew old.    [Footnote 30: They were almost completely exterminated by the Iroquois  confederacy between thirty and forty years after Champlain's visit.]    \"Their life\", writes Champlain, \"is a miserable one in comparison  with our own, but they are happy amongst themselves, not having  experienced anything better, nor imagining that anything more  excellent could be found.\"    These Amerindians ordinarily ate two meals a day, and although  Champlain and his men fasted all through Lent, \"in order to influence  them by our example\", that was one of the practices they did _not_  copy from the French.    The Hurons of this period painted their faces black and red, mixing  the colours with oil made from sunflower seed, or with bears' fat. The  hair was carefully combed and oiled, and sometimes dyed a reddish  colour; it might be worn long or short, or only on one side of the  head. The women usually dressed theirs in one long plait. Sometimes it  was done up into a knot at the back of the head, bound with eelskin.  The men were usually dressed in deerskin breeches, with gaiters of  soft leather. The shoes (\"Moccasins\") were made of the skin of deer,  bears, or beavers. In addition to this the men in cold weather wore a  great cloak. The edges of these cloaks would often be decorated with  bands of brown and red colour alternating with strips of a  whitish-blue, and ornamented with bands of porcupine quills. These,  which were originally white or grey in colour, had been previously  dyed a fine scarlet with colouring matter from the root of the  bed-straw (_Galium tinctorum_). The women were loaded with necklaces  of violet or white shell beads, bracelets, ear-rings, and great  strings of beads falling below the waist. Sometimes they would have  plates of leather studded with shell beads and hanging over the back.    [Illustration: SAMUEL DE CHAMPLAIN; ALEXANDER HENRY THE ELDER]    In 1616 Champlain returned to France, but visited Quebec in 1617 and  1618. During the years spent at Quebec, which followed his  explorations of 1616, he was greatly impeded in his work of  consolidating Canada as a French colony by the religious strife  between the Catholics and Huguenots, and the narrow-minded greed of  the Chartered company of fur-trading merchants for whom he worked. But  in 1620 he came back to Canada as Lieutenant-Governor (bringing his  wife with him), and after attending to the settlement of a violent  commercial dispute between fur-trading companies he tried to compose  the quarrel between the Iroquois and the Algonkins, and brought about  a truce which lasted till 1627.    In 1628 came the first English attack on Canada. A French fleet was  defeated and captured in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and in the  following year Champlain, having been obliged to surrender Quebec (he  had only sixteen soldiers as a garrison, owing to lack of food),  voyaged to England more or less as a prisoner of state in the summer  of 1629. He found, on arriving there, that the cession of Quebec was  null and void, peace having been concluded between Britain and France  two months before the cession. Charles I remained true to his compact  with Louis XIII, and Quebec and Nova Scotia were restored to French  keeping. In 1633 Champlain returned to Canada as Governor, bringing  with him a considerable number of French colonists. _It is from 1633  that the real French colonization of Canada begins_: hitherto there  had been only one family of settlers in the fixed sense of the word;  the other Frenchmen were fur traders, soldiers, and missionaries. But  Champlain only lived two years after his triumphant return, and died  at Quebec on Christmas Day, 1635.    His character has been so well summed up by Dr. S.E. Dawson, in his  admirable book on the _Story of the St. Lawrence Basin_, that I cannot  do better than quote his words:    \"Champlain was as much at home in the brilliant court of France as in  a wigwam on a Canadian lake, as patient and politic with a wild band  of savages on Lake Huron as with a crowd of grasping traders in St.  Malo or Dieppe. Always calm, always unselfish, always depending on  God, in whom he believed and trusted, and thinking of France, which he  loved, this single-hearted man resolutely followed the path of his  duty under all circumstances; never looking for ease or asking for  profit, loved by the wild people of the forest, respected by the  courtiers of the king, and trusted by the close-fisted merchants of  the maritime cities of France.\"          CHAPTER V    After Champlain: from Montreal to the Mississippi      A very remarkable series of further explorations were carried out as  the indirect result of Champlain's work. In 1610 he had allowed a  French boy of about eighteen years of age, named ETIENNE BRULE, to  volunteer to go away with the Algonkins, in order to learn their  language. Brule was taken in hand by Iroquet,[1] a chief of the  \"Little Algonkins\", whose people were then occupying the lands on  either side of the Ottawa River, including the site of the now great  city of Ottawa. After four years of roaming with the Indians, Brule  was dispatched by Champlain with an escort of twelve Algonkins to the  headwaters of the Suskuehanna, far to the south of Lake Ontario, in  order to warn the Andastes[2] tribe of military operations to be  undertaken by the allied French, Hurons, and Algonkins against the  Iroquois. This enabled Brule to explore Lake Ontario and to descend  the River"]]]
