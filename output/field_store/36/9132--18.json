When he once knows what we want him to  do, he will do it or die in trying.\"    Just then the boat lurched badly and the people slipped and slid on the  slanting, wet deck, but Jan did not move. His firm muscles stiffened,  he braced himself steadily and his strong back straightened. The group  of officers began talking again and Jan heard them say something about  his strength to Captain Smith. A heavier wave lifted the ship from the  rocks then dropped her back on the jagged edges that were stabbing her  to the heart, while she writhed and groaned like a living thing in agony  begging for help.    The ship's captain turned his eyes on the group of women and children,  then to the shore, as though he were measuring the distance across the  raging water that boomed between the boat and land. Slowly he turned  back to the old man and the dog.    \"He may be able to do it, if you can make him understand,\" he said at  last. Then he added in a low voice, \"It is our only hope!\"    Jan saw these men all were looking at him and then the ship's captain  spoke.    \"If the dog can reach shore with the light rope so we can attach the  heavier one, we can rig up a breeches-buoy with the boatswain's chair,  and the women and children could ride safely, for we could lash them to  it.\"    Captain Smith leaned down and took Jan's head between trembling hands.  The dog and he looked into each other's eyes, and those who watched the  two, felt a little thrill of hope. The animal seemed struggling to grasp  the meaning of the old man's words. A bit of rope was in the captain's  hand, he held it to Jan, who sniffed, then looked back at his master.    Still holding the piece of rope, Captain Smith led the dog to the side  of the boat and pointed at the tangled coils that washed on the surface  of the waves a short distance away.    \"Go get it, Jan!\" called the old man sharply.    The people on the deck crowded more closely, and the dog braced himself  to spring, but just then a huge wave rose high over the vessel, the  white-crested tip hissing like an angry snake, and Jan looked down,  down, down into a dark hole and below it gleamed the jagged peaks of the  reef, like threatening teeth of a hidden monster. He knew the danger.  Drawing back he turned pleading eyes on his master.    \"Go, Jan,\" said the voice he loved, but this time it did not command, it  begged.    The big wave slipped back, others rose behind it, each one tipped with  white foam, and between those waves were deep, dark hollows. Jan looked  at them, and as he looked, something changed those white-capped things  into snowy peaks of the mountains around the Hospice, while the dark  places between were changed to chasms and crevasses, where Barry, Pluto,  Pallas, Rex and all the dogs of the Hospice had travelled year after  year for ten centuries past. He heard their voices calling him. Jan's  ears cocked up, his body quivered, his muscles stiffened, his nose  pointed high in the air and the cry he sent back to the calls of his kin  was clear and strong like the music of a wonderful, deep-toned bell.  Then he braced himself and leaped far out into the water that caught him  like many strong arms and dragged him under the waves.    With all his great strength Jan fought his way to the surface and as he  rose, something struck against him. He turned quickly to see what new  danger threatened, and then he saw the rope and remembered what he had  been told.    \"Go get it, Jan!\" his master had said.    [Illustration: _\"Then the roaring in his ears turned to the voices of  the Hospice dogs--'The duty of a St. Bernard is to save lives!'\"_]    The dog caught the squirming rope between his teeth, and as he did so,  he heard distinctly the cheers of those on the stranded ship echoed by  those on the shore before he was pulled down beneath the waves again;  but he clung to the rope. When he reached the surface, Jan saw his  master leaning far over the edge of the deck, pointing toward the land.    Then he understood, and without a moment's hesitation he flung his body  away from the direction of the boat and faced the shore, while the rope  trailed behind him, often dragging him back with terrific jerks. The  force of the waves tossed him high on dizzy crests, then he was dropped  swiftly into depths of seething water. His breath came in painful gasps  between his tightly clinched teeth, the water rang in his ears and he  was half-blinded by the stinging salt spray that cut like a sharp knife  across his eyes.    In spite of his struggles he seemed no nearer the land. Back of him he  could see the swaying masts of the boat, and at times the whole length  of the deck with people crowded together. Jan, dazed and almost  exhausted, turned to swim back to his master and safety. His paws beat  the waves more feebly, but his teeth still held the rope. Down, down,  down he sank, and over his head rolled the white-crested mountains of  water. Then the roaring in his ears turned to the voices of the Hospice  dogs. The voices of Barry Bruno, Rex and Jan's mother sounded clearly.  Other dogs joined in the chorus until Jan knew that he heard the voices  of all the dogs that had ever lived in the Hospice. Hundreds and  hundreds of deep notes, like the bells of the Hospice sending a message  to him. \"The duty of a St. Bernard is to save lives!\"    He fought with new strength, and as his head rose above the waves, the  rope still dragging along, he heard cheers that grew nearer and louder,  but this time the voices came from the land. A breaker curled high,  dashed furiously over him and then it carried him with a rush to the  beach and flung him, gasping and exhausted, high on the sand, but the  end of the rope was clutched tightly between his teeth. He held it, even  when men tried to take it from him, but the hands were kindly and as his  jaws relaxed he was lifted gently and carried where the cruel waves  could not touch him again.    Jan was too tired to open his eyes when some one knelt beside him and  stroked his wet hair, and a man's voice said huskily, \"You wonderful,  brave fellow!\"    Cheers sounded loud and long, and at last Jan opened his eyes and lifted  his head wearily for a second. Before it dropped again to the sand, he  saw men on the shore working with another, heavier rope, and some one  called out, \"Thank God! They got it that time!\"    Jan staggered to his feet and with wobbling legs moved a few steps  forward. Then he forgot his weariness and aching muscles and stood  watching something strange, something that made women near him cry, and  the men cheer wildly.    A rope reached from the shore to the stranded ship, and something was  moving slowly along that rope toward the land. Jan's feet were in the  surf, but he did not know it as he, too, watched and saw a chair, and in  that chair was a woman.    She was seized by eager hands and lifted down among them, laughing and  crying and saying, \"Oh, quick! Save the others!\"    Again and again the chair travelled over the waves that leaped up to  clutch it, but the rope was firm. And once when a woman was carried in  the chair, a man on the shore gave a big cry of joy as he clasped her in  his arms. Jan recognized the pretty lady, but she did not have her baby  in her arms this time. Then every one was silent, only a woman's sob  sounded softly, and the pretty lady stood staring across the water,  where high above the waves swung a big leather mailbag. It came nearer  and nearer, and men went far out into the surf to steady it, until it  was unfastened, lifted down, opened, and the pretty lady, crying and  laughing, held her baby in her arms, and the child laughed back at them  all.    Men cheered and cheered, and from the ship came answering cheers, while  the mother and father of the child knelt down beside the dog, saying,  \"You saved her, Prince Jan!\"    The dog watched vainly for his master. Trip after trip brought men and  women to the land, and each one was welcomed wildly. Then Jan, still  watching, gave a great \"Woof!\" and rushed out into the water. The chair  was approaching the shore, and in the chair was Jan's master. A basket  was held in the old man's lap and on it was fastened a bird cage with a  badly frightened canary. Through a break in the basket waved  Hippity-Hop's furry paw. Those on the shore scattered as Prince Jan  raced among them uttering hysterical yelps until his master stood safely  beside him and leaned down catching the dog's long, soft ears and  pulling them gently, while he said over and over, \"Jan, Prince Jan! I  knew you would do it!\"    And so, ninety-one people were brought safely to shore in the  boatswain's chair with the rope that Prince Jan had carried, and the  baby that had ridden in the mail sack was kissed and hugged by all those  who could get near her.    Then Prince Jan followed the captain, the pretty lady, and the man who  walked beside her with the baby perched high on his shoulder, and who  had his other arm around the waist of the baby's mother. A tiny paw  reached out of the hamper Captain Smith was carrying, and the dog felt  the tap of Hippity-Hop's paw on his ear. He turned at the touch and put  his nose to the basket, and then he saw Cheepsie, fluttering in the cage  that was gripped by the old captain's other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14900"],[0,"The Black Man's Place in South Africa (#16)"],[1,"speech and deeper than thought, so that, although we  admit that this racial antipathy is not justified by logical reasoning,  we may nevertheless recognise it as a feeling grounded in man's inner  nature--in his heart, so to speak--hardening it against other men whom  he feels he cannot receive and entreat as brothers; in other words, we  may say that this feeling is not the result of ratiocination but of  forces that are deeper and more elemental than reason; that it is a  hardening of heart rather than a mental conviction, in which sense we  may apply the words of Pascal \"Le caeur a ses raisons que la raison ne  connait pas.\"    Now if I am right in thinking that this racial feeling is engendered  instinctively by physical dissimilarity only then we may not expect it  to be removed or even lessened by the increased and general advancement  of the Natives, for although we may hope that the whites will gradually  come to recognise the abstract justice of the civilised Natives' claim  to full racial equality we must, at the same time, remember that the  increasing competition of the black man in every walk of life is bound  to bring into play and accentuate the natural race prejudice of the  white man whereby the tolerance and good feeling that might otherwise  result from a growing recognition of the civilised Natives' mental and  moral worth will be more than negatived. The present state of affairs in  the Southern States of America is a warning against easy optimism in  this respect. We must expect clashing and growing ill-will rather than  social serenity to be the outcome of a continued policy of drift.    To condemn the wrong of repression would to-day be like preaching to the  converted. Most people now admit that the Africans are entitled, no less  than the Europeans, to develop themselves as far and as fully as they  can, but the question remains how they can be allowed to do so without  intensifying present antipathy on both sides. Parallelism is a word that  has been used a great deal of late to signify an attitude of mind, as I  take it, rather than a definite policy or plan of action, through which  it is hoped that separate scope for civilised activity and development  may be given to the Natives on lines parallel to those along which the  whites pursue their separate course, but without any forced territorial  separation of the two people. Metaphor of this kind is undoubtedly  useful to the political speaker in that it enables him to be apt without  being exact, and thereby frees him from the possibility of being pinned  down to a stated position, but in serious discussion exactness rather  than aptness is desired, and to the thinking man the figure of speech,  by which the notion of two lines running always parallel without meeting  is applied to the course of development of two races living together in  one country, is not convincing.    This idea of parallelism is based on the presumption that the ruling  race can so rule itself that by the mere exercise of its collective  will-power it can refuse always to mix socially with the growing numbers  of civilised Natives living and working in the same localities, and  thereby--in a manner not yet explained--avoid always the clashing and  ill-will that seems inseparable from the close contact of two dissimilar  races competing against one another in one country. The advice offered  from afar is that the whites should allow the Natives equal  opportunities with themselves in all the ways of civilised activity,  but--should not invite them home to dinner. Being based on an  unwarranted presumption parallelism here begs the question, for it is  precisely the ability of the ruling race to follow this counsel of  perfection that is in doubt. It is easy to urge that the Europeans must  maintain their position in South Africa as \"a benevolent aristocracy of  ability,\" but we want to know how this can be done. A recent contributor  to the general question of colour has stated that the true conception  of the inter-relation of white and black races should be \"complete  uniformity in ideals, absolute equality in the paths of knowledge and  culture, equal opportunity for those who strive, equal admiration for  those who achieve; in matters social and racial a separate path, each  pursuing his own inherited traditions, preserving his own race-purity  and race-pride; equality in things spiritual; agreed divergence in the  physical and material.\"[25] But, again, we want to know how this  abstract conception is to be put into actual practice in this world of  things as they are.    I have said that the Natives do not hanker after intimate social  intimacy with the whites, but this does not mean that the civilised  black man who has risen to the economic and educational level of the  European remains indifferent whenever his claim to ordinary social  recognition is denied or ignored. He would not, indeed, be human if he  did not feel hurt whenever he is slighted and treated with contempt by  people from whom he differs only in his physical appearance and colour.  In one of his essays, dealing with Native matters, Professor Jabavu, a  Native, describes how \"high\" feeling arose among the Native teachers and  boys in a certain training institution in South Africa at which he had  been invited to lecture because he was not allowed to see the inside of  the European principal's house, despite the fact that he had ten years  of English university life behind him.[26] Such feeling is only natural  and must tend always to create ill-will, and, knowing how strong is the  convention of the whites against social recognition of the educated  Native, we must expect increased bitterness in the future, rather than  growing good-will.    The thinking white man, who would fain be just to every one, is  perplexed by two conflicting emotions. He feels that the clean-living,  law-abiding, educated Native is a man not inferior to himself whom he  therefore ought to recognise as a fellow-citizen, but whenever he sees  this fellow-citizen aspiring or laying claim to the social recognition  that involves contact with white women he is filled instantly with wrath  which he cannot justify to himself and yet cannot suppress. It is easy  to see that where instead of common courtesy and mutual recognition from  one another of two sections of a community, constant irritation and  ill-will result, there the existence of the whole is threatened with  disaster. Under such conditions we must expect, not parallel progress,  but strife and enmity; not peace, but a sword.    The Jews may be cited to show how a separate and peculiar people may be  able to live together with other races without either clashing with or  being assimilated by these but we must remember that the ethnic  difference between the Jews and Europeans are too slight to sustain  serious and lasting race-antipathy. Parallelism, when applied to the  Native problem of South Africa, is clearly nothing more than the old,  plan-less drift continued in the pious hope that human nature will  sooner or later change into something better than what it is to-day. But  human nature will not change. We must never leave passion out of  account. If we recognise love we must recognise hate also as a moving  force of mankind. Neither must we overlook vanity and arrogance. The  white man, being human, will not cease to be vain and ambitious, he  will not cease to feel the hatred that comes from the fear of losing  possession of his mates, and possession is the natural man's definition  of love. Where there is a sense of possession there will also be  jealousy and hate, and it will only be by securing the white man in his  sense of racial integrity that peace and good-will can be made to last.    Territorial separation of the home-life of the two races is the only way  by which parallel development can take place. Some of the Native leaders  who have opposed this policy have done so in the belief that their  people might eventually be able to prove and enforce their claim to full  racial equality, but they have not realised that this claim will be  denied always on physical grounds, and not on considerations of moral  worth. These leaders mean well but they do not see well. Smarting under  the pain of their treatment they do not perceive that the real issue is  one of unalterable physical disparity.    The hardships and disabilities under which the educated Native suffers  in the Northern Provinces of the Union and in Rhodesia are patent and  serious. It is hard that a civilised man may not travel in his own  country without a \"certificate\"; it is hard that he must do only rough  or menial, but always ill-paid, work when he is capable of doing skilled  and well-paid labour; it is hard that when he is allowed to do skilled  labour he cannot claim the wages of a skilled labourer; it is hard to be  denied always the privileges of a civilised existence for which he has  proved himself fit and worthy; it is hard to be treated always as an  inferior and an alien in the land of his fathers; all this is hard,  but--'tis the law, written and unwritten, made and enforced by the  dominant race, and there is no reason to think it will be made less hard  as the pressure of black competition increases.    But if good and ample land can be set aside in the various territories  of spacious South Africa in which the Natives can live and move without  let or hindrance; in which they can do what work they like for  themselves and for their own people; in which they can engage, according  to their individual desires, in all kinds of trades and commerce without  the prohibition of the white man's colour-bar; in which they can earn  the wages that are governed by the laws of supply and demand only; in  which they can build up after their own fashion courts of law and  political councils for themselves; in which, _in fine_ they can live and  work out their own"]]]
