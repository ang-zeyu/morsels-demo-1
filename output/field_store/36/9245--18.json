A Midas sought in marriage Hermodike,  the daughter of Agamemnon the Kymsoan, while another Midas, who  had consulted the oracle of Delphi, presented to the god the  chryselephantine throne on which he was wont to sit when he dispensed  justice.

This interchange of amenities and these alliances, however, had a merely  superficial effect, and in no way modified the temperament and life  of the people in inner Asia Minor. They remained a robust, hardworking  race, attached to their fields and woods, loutish and slow of  understanding, unskilled in war, and not apt in defending themselves in  spite of their natural bravery. The Lydians, on the contrary, submitted  readily to foreign influence, and the Greek leaven introduced among them  became the germ of a new civilisation, which occupied an intermediate  place between that of the Greek and that of the Oriental world. About  the first half of the eighth century B.C. the Lydians had become  organised into a confederation of several tribes, governed by hereditary  chiefs, who were again in their turn subject to the Heraclidae occupying  Sardes.* This town rose in terraces on the lower slopes of a detached  spur of the Tmolus running in the direction of the Hermos, and was  crowned by the citadel, within which were included the royal palace,  the treasury, and the arsenals. It was surrounded by an immense plain,  bounded on the south by a curve of the Tmolus, and on the west by the  distant mountains of Phrygia Katake-kaumene. The Maeonians still claimed  primacy over the entire race, and the family was chosen from among their  nobles. The king, who was supposed to be descended from the gods, bore,  as the insignia of his rank, a double-headed axe, the emblem of his  divine ancestors. The Greeks of later times said that the axe was that  of their Heracles, which was wrested by him from the Amazon Hippolyta,  and given to Omphale.**         * Gelzer was the first, to my knowledge, to state that Lydia       was a feudal state, and he defined its constitution. Radet       refuses to recognise it as feudal in the true sense of the       term, and he prefers to see in it a confederation of states       under the authority of a single prince.         ** Gelzer sees in the legend about the axe related by       Plutarch, a reminiscence of a primitive gynocracy. The axe       is the emblem of the god of war, and, as such, belongs to       the king: the coins of Mylasa exhibit it held by Zeus       Labraundos.    [Illustration: 106.jpg THE AXE BORNE BY ZEUS LABRAUNDOS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a coin in the Cabinet des       Medailles.    The king was the supreme head of the priesthood, as also of the vassal  chiefs and of the army, but he had as a subordinate a \"companion\" who  could replace him when occasion demanded, and he was assisted in the  exercise of his functions by the counsel of \"Friends,\" and further still  in extraordinary circumstances by the citizens of the capital assembled  in the public square. This intervention of the voice of the populace  was a thing unknown in the East, and had probably been introduced in  imitation of customs observed among the Greeks of AEolia or Ionia; it was  an important political factor, and might possibly lead to an outbreak or  a revolution. Outside the pale of Sardes and the province of Maeonia, the  bulk of Lydian territory was distributed among a very numerous body of  landowners, who were particularly proud of their noble descent. Many of  these country magnates held extensive fiefs, and had in their pay small  armies, which rendered them almost independent, and the only way for  the sovereign to succeed in ruling them was to conciliate them at all  hazards, and to keep them in perpetual enmity with their fellows. Two of  these rival families vied with each other in their efforts to secure  the royal favour; that of the Tylonidae and that of the Mermnadae, the  principal domain of which latter lay at Teira, in the valley of the  Cayster, though they had also other possessions at Dascylion, in  Hellespontine Phrygia. The head sometimes of one and sometimes of the  other family would fill that post of \"companion\" which placed all the  resources of the kingdom at the disposal of the occupant.    The first of the Mermnadae of whom we get a glimpse is Daskylos, son of  Gyges, who about the year 740 was \"companion\" during the declining years  of Ardys, over whom he exercised such influence that Adyattes, the  heir to the throne, took umbrage at it, and caused him to be secretly  assassinated, whereupon his widow, fearing for her own safety, hastily  fled into Phrygia, of which district she was a native. On hearing of the  crime, Ardys, trembling with anger, convoked the Assembly, and as his  advanced age rendered walking difficult, he caused himself to be carried  to the public square in a litter. Having reached the place, he laid the  assassins under a curse, and gave permission to any who could find them  to kill them; he then returned to his palace, where he died a few years  later, about 730 B.C. Adyattes took the name of Meles on ascending the  throne, and at first reigned happily, but his father's curse weighed  upon him, and before long began to take effect. Lydia having been laid  waste by a famine, the oracle declared that, before appeasing the gods,  the king must expiate the murder of the Mermnad noble, by making every  atonement in his power, if need be by an exile of three years' duration.  Meles submitted to the divine decree. He sought out the widow of his  victim, and learning that during her flight she had given birth to a  son, called, like his father, Daskylos, he sent to entreat the young  man to repair immediately to Sardes, that he might make amends for the  murder; the youth, however, alleged that he was as yet unborn at the  hour of his father's death, and therefore not entitled to be a party  to an arrangement which did not personally affect him, and refused  to return to his own country. Having failed in this attempt, Meles  entrusted the regency of his kingdom to Sadyattes, son of Kadys, one of  the Tylonidas, who probably had already filled the post of companion  to the king for some time past, and set out for Babylon. When the three  years had elapsed, Sadyattes faithfully handed over to him the reins of  government and resumed the second place. Myrsos succeeded Meles about  716,* and his accession immediately became the cause of uneasiness  to the younger Daskylos, who felt that he was no longer safe from the  intrigues of the Heraclidai; he therefore quitted Phrygia and settled  beyond the Italys among the White Syrians, one of whom he took in  marriage, and had by her a son, whom he called Gyges, after his  ancestor. The Lydian chronicles which have come down to us make no  mention of him, after the birth of this child, for nearly a quarter of a  century. We know, however, from other sources, that the country in which  he took refuge had for some time past been ravaged by enemies coming  from the Caucasus, known to us as the Cimmerians.**         * The lists of Eusebius give 36 years to Ardys, 14 years to       Meles or Adyattes, 12 years to Myrsos, and 17 years to       Candaules; that is to say, if we place the accession of       Gyges in 687, the dates of the reign of Candaules are 704-       687, of that of Mysros 716-704, of that of Meles 730-716, of       that of Ardys I. 766-730. Oelzer thinks that the double       names each represent a different Icing; Radet adheres to the       four generations of Eusebius.         ** I would gladly have treated at length the subject of the       Cimmerians with its accompanying developments, but lack of       space prevents me from doing more than summing up here the       position I have taken. Most modern critics have rejected       that part of the tradition preserved by Herodotus which       refers to the itinerary of the Cimmerians, and have confused       the Cimmerian invasion with that of the Thracian tribes. I       think that there is reason to give weight to Herodotus'       statement, and to distinguish carefully between two series       of events: (1) a movement of peoples coming from Europe into       Asia, by the routes that Herodotus indicates, about the       latter half of the eighth century B.C., who would be more       especially the Cimmerians; (2) a movement of peoples coming       from Europe into Asia by the Thracian Bosphorus, and among       whom there was perhaps, side by side with the Treres, a       remnant of Cimmerian tribes who had been ousted by the       Scythians. The two streams would have had their confluence       in the heart of Asia Minor, in the first half of the seventh       century.

Previous to this period these had been an almost mythical race in the  eyes of the civilised races of the Oriental world. They imagined them as  living in a perpetual mist on the confines of the universe: \"Never  does bright Helios look upon them with his rays, neither when he rises  towards the starry heaven, nor when he turns back from heaven towards  the earth, but a baleful night spreads itself over these miserable  mortals.\"*         * Odyssey, xi. 14-19. It is this passage which Ephorus       applies to the Cimmerians of his own time who were       established in the Crimea, and which accounts for his saying       that they were a race of miners, living perpetually       underground.

Such finds constituted the great events of  his life, in comparison with which the political revolutions of Asia  and Africa diminished in importance day by day. It is difficult to tell  whether this indifference to the weighty affairs of government was as  complete as it appears to us at this distance of time. Certain facts  recorded in the official chronicles of that date go to prove that,  except in name and external pomp, the king was a nonentity. The real  power lay in the hands of the nobles and generals, and Bel-sharuzur, the  king's son, directed affairs for them in his father's name. Nabonidus  meanwhile resided in a state of inactivity at his palace of Tima, and it  is possible that his condition may have really been that of a prisoner,  for he never left Tima to go to Babylon, even on the days of great  festivals, and his absence prevented the celebration of the higher  rites of the national religion, with the procession of Bel and its  accompanying ceremonies, for several consecutive years. The people  suffered from these quarrels in high places; not only the native  Babylonians or Kalda, who were thus deprived of their accustomed  spectacles, and whose piety was scandalised by these dissensions, but  also the foreign races dispersed over Mesopotamia, from the confluence  of the Khabur to the mouths of the Euphrates. Too widely scattered or  too weak to make an open declaration of their independence, their hopes  and their apprehensions were alternately raised by the various reports  of hostilities which reached their ears. The news of the first  victories of the Persians aroused in the exiled Jews the idea of speedy  deliverance, and Cyrus clearly appeared to them as the hero chosen by  Jahveh to reinstate them in the country, of their forefathers.    The number of the Jewish exiles, which perhaps at first had not exceeded  20,000* had largely increased in the half-century of their captivity,  and even if numerically they were of no great importance, their social  condition entitled them to be considered as the _elite_ of all Israel.         * The body of exiles of 597 consisted of ten thousand       persons, of whom seven thousand belonged to the wealthy, and       one thousand to the artisan class, while the remainder       consisted of people attached to the court (2 Kings xxiv. 14-       16). In the body of 587 are reckoned three thousand and       twenty-three inhabitants of Judah, and eight hundred and       thirty-two dwellers in Jerusalem. But the body of exiles of       581 numbers only seven hundred and forty-five persons (Jer.       lii. 30). These numbers are sufficiently moderate to be       possibly exact, but they are far from being certain.    There had at first been the two kings, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah, their  families, the aristocracy of Judah, the priests and pontiff of the  temple, the prophets, the most skilled of the artisan class and the  soldiery. Though distributed over Babylon and the neighbouring cities,  we know from authentic sources of only one of their settlements, that  of Tell-Abib on the Chebar* though many of the Jewish colonies which  flourished thereabouts in Roman times could undoubtedly trace their  origin to the days of the captivity; one legend found in the Talmud  affirmed that the synagogue of Shafyathib, near Nehardaa, had been built  by King Jehoiachin with stones brought from the ruins of the temple at  Jerusalem. These communities enjoyed a fairly complete autonomy, and  were free to administer their own affairs as they pleased, provided that  they paid their tribute or performed their appointed labours without  complaint. The shekhs, or elders of the family or tribe, who had played  so important a part in their native land, still held their respective  positions; the Chaldaeans had permitted them to retain all the  possessions which they had been able to bring with them into exile, and  recognised them as the rulers of their people, who were responsible to  their conquerors for the obedience of those under them, leaving them  entire liberty to exercise their authority so long as they maintained  order and tranquillity among their subordinates.**         * Ezek. iii. 15. The Chebar or Kebar has been erroneously       identified with the Khabur; cuneiform documents show that it       was one of the canals near Nipur.         ** Cf. the assemblies of these chiefs at the house of       Ezekiel and their action (viii. 1; xiv. 1; xx. 1).    How the latter existed, and what industries they pursued in order to  earn their daily bread, no writer of the time has left on record. The  rich plain of the Euphrates differed so widely from the soil to which  they had been accustomed in the land of Judah, with its bare or sparsely  wooded hills, slopes cultivated in terraces, narrow and ill-watered  wadys, and tortuous and parched valleys, that they must have felt  themselves much out of their element in their Chaldaean surroundings.  They had all of them, however, whether artisans, labourers, soldiers,  gold-workers, or merchants, to earn their living, and they succeeded in  doing so, following meanwhile the advice of Jeremiah, by taking every  precaution that the seed of Israel should not be diminished.* The  imagination of pious writers of a later date delighted to represent the  exiled Jews as giving way to apathy and vain regrets: \"By the rivers of  Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. Upon  the willows in the midst thereof we hanged up our harps. For there  they that led us captive required of us songs, and they that wasted  us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How  shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?\"**         * Jer. xxix. 1-7.         ** Ps. cxxxvii. 1-4.    This was true of the priests and scribes only. A blank had been made in  their existence from the moment when the conqueror had dragged them  from the routine of daily rites which their duties in the temple service  entailed upon them. The hours which had been formerly devoted to their  offices were now expended in bewailing the misfortunes of their nation,  in accusing themselves and others, and in demanding what crime had  merited this punishment, and why Jahveh, who had so often shown clemency  to their forefathers, had not extended His forgiveness to them. It  was, however, by the long-suffering of God that His prophets, and  particularly Ezekiel, were allowed to make known to them the true cause  of their downfall. The more Ezekiel in his retreat meditated upon  their lot, the more did the past appear to him as a lamentable conflict  between divine justice and Jewish iniquity. At the time of their sojourn  in Egypt, Jahveh had taken the house of Jacob under His protection,  and in consideration of His help had merely demanded of them that they  should be faithful to Him. \"Cast ye away every man the abominations of  his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the  Lord your God.\" The children of Israel, however, had never observed this  easy condition, and this was the root of their ills; even before  they were liberated from the yoke of Pharaoh, they had betrayed their  Protector, and He had thought to punish them: \"But I wrought for My  name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations,  among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them....  So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them  into the wilderness. And I gave them My statutes, and showed them My  judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them. Moreover also I  gave them My sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them... but the house  of Israel rebelled against Me.\" As they had acted in Egypt, so they  acted at the foot of Sinai, and again Jahveh could not bring Himself to  destroy them; He confined Himself to decreeing that none of those who  had offended Him should enter the Promised Land, and He extended His  goodness to their children. But these again showed themselves no  wiser than their fathers; scarcely had they taken possession of the  inheritance which had fallen to them, \"a land flowing with milk and  honey... the glory of all lands,\" than when they beheld \"every high hill  and every thick tree... they offered there their sacrifices, and there  they presented the provocation of their offering, there also they made  their sweet savour, and they poured out there their drink offerings.\"  Not contented with profaning their altars by impious ceremonies and  offerings, they further bowed the knee to idols, thinking in their  hearts, \"We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries,  to serve wood and stone.\" \"As I live, saith the Lord God, surely with a  mighty hand and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will  I be King over you.\"*         1 Ezek. xx.    However just the punishment, Bzekiel did not believe that it would last  for ever. The righteousness of God would not permit future generations  to be held responsible for ever for the sins of generations past and  present. \"What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of  Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's  teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have  occasion to use this proverb any more in Israel! Behold, all souls are  Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine;  the soul that sinneth it shall die. But if a man be just... he shall  surely live, saith the Lord God.\" Israel, therefore, was master of his  own destiny. If he persisted in erring from the right way, the hour  of salvation was still further removed from him; if he repented and  observed the law, the Divine anger would be turned away. \"Therefore...
