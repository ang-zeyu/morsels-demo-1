I  wonder not at this, but bear with me a little; watch and pray--the  darkness shall vanish, the storm sleep, and God Himself, as He came of  yore on the seas of Samaria, shall walk over the lulled billows, to the  delivery of your soul.  Ours is a religion jealous in its demands, but  how infinitely prodigal in its gifts! It troubles you for an hour, it  repays you by immortality.'    'Such promises,' said Apaecides, sullenly, 'are the tricks by which man  is ever gulled.  Oh, glorious were the promises which led me to the  shrine of Isis!'    'But,' answered the Nazarene, 'ask thy reason, can that religion be  sound which outrages all morality?  You are told to worship your gods.  What are those gods, even according to yourselves?  What their actions,  what their attributes?  Are they not all represented to you as the  blackest of criminals? yet you are asked to serve them as the holiest of  divinities. Jupiter himself is a parricide and an adulterer.  What are  the meaner deities but imitators of his vices?  You are told not to  murder, but you worship murderers; you are told not to commit adultery,  and you make your prayers to an adulterer!  Oh!  what is this but a  mockery of the holiest part of man's nature, which is faith?  Turn now  to the God, the one, the true God, to whose shrine I would lead you.  If  He seem to you too sublime, two shadowy, for those human associations,  those touching connections between Creator and creature, to which the  weak heart clings--contemplate Him in His Son, who put on mortality like  ourselves.  His mortality is not indeed declared, like that of your  fabled gods, by the vices of our nature, but by the practice of all its  virtues.  In Him are united the austerest morals with the tenderest  affections.  If He were but a mere man, He had been worthy to become a  god.  You honour Socrates--he has his sect, his disciples, his schools.  But what are the doubtful virtues of the Athenian, to the bright, the  undisputed, the active, the unceasing, the devoted holiness of Christ?  I speak to you now only of His human character.  He came in that as the  pattern of future ages, to show us the form of virtue which Plato  thirsted to see embodied. This was the true sacrifice that He made for  man; but the halo that encircled His dying hour not only brightened  earth, but opened to us the sight of heaven!  You are touched--you are  moved.  God works in your heart.  His Spirit is with you.  Come, resist  not the holy impulse; come at once--unhesitatingly.  A few of us are now  assembled to expound the word of God.  Come, let me guide you to them.  You are sad, you are weary.  Listen, then, to the words of God: \"Come to  me\", saith He, \"all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest!\"'    'I cannot now,' said Apaecides; 'another time.'    'Now--now!' exclaimed Olinthus, earnestly, and clasping him by the arm.    But Apaecides, yet unprepared for the renunciation of that faith--that  life, for which he had sacrificed so much, and still haunted by the  promises of the Egyptian, extricated himself forcibly from the grasp;  and feeling an effort necessary to conquer the irresolution which the  eloquence of the Christian had begun to effect in his heated and  feverish mind, he gathered up his robes and fled away with a speed that  defied pursuit.    Breathless and exhausted, he arrived at last in a remote and sequestered  part of the city, and the lone house of the Egyptian stood before him.  As he paused to recover himself, the moon emerged from a silver cloud,  and shone full upon the walls of that mysterious habitation.    No other house was near--the darksome vines clustered far and wide in  front of the building and behind it rose a copse of lofty forest trees,  sleeping in the melancholy moonlight; beyond stretched the dim outline  of the distant hills, and amongst them the quiet crest of Vesuvius, not  then so lofty as the traveler beholds it now.    Apaecides passed through the arching vines, and arrived at the broad and  spacious portico.  Before it, on either side of the steps, reposed the  image of the Egyptian sphinx, and the moonlight gave an additional and  yet more solemn calm to those large, and harmonious, and passionless  features, in which the sculptors of that type of wisdom united so much  of loveliness with awe; half way up the extremities of the steps  darkened the green and massive foliage of the aloe, and the shadow of  the eastern palm cast its long and unwaving boughs partially over the  marble surface of the stairs.    Something there was in the stillness of the place, and the strange  aspect of the sculptured sphinxes, which thrilled the blood of the  priest with a nameless and ghostly fear, and he longed even for an echo  to his noiseless steps as he ascended to the threshold.    He knocked at the door, over which was wrought an inscription in  characters unfamiliar to his eyes; it opened without a sound, and a tall  Ethiopian slave, without question or salutation, motioned to him to  proceed.    The wide hall was lighted by lofty candelabra of elaborate bronze, and  round the walls were wrought vast hieroglyphics, in dark and solemn  colors, which contrasted strangely with the bright hues and graceful  shapes with which the inhabitants of Italy decorated their abodes.  At  the extremity of the hall, a slave, whose countenance, though not  African, was darker by many shades than the usual color of the south,  advanced to meet him.    'I seek Arbaces,' said the priest; but his voice trembled even in his  own ear.  The slave bowed his head in silence, and leading Apaecides to  a wing without the hall, conducted him up a narrow staircase, and then  traversing several rooms, in which the stern and thoughtful beauty of  the sphinx still made the chief and most impressive object of the  priest's notice, Apaecides found himself in a dim and half-lighted  chamber, in the presence of the Egyptian.    Arbaces was seated before a small table, on which lay unfolded several  scrolls of papyrus, impressed with the same character as that on the  threshold of the mansion.  A small tripod stood at a little distance,  from the incense in which the smoke slowly rose.  Near this was a vast  globe, depicting the signs of heaven; and upon another table lay several  instruments, of curious and quaint shape, whose uses were unknown to  Apaecides.  The farther extremity of the room was concealed by a  curtain, and the oblong window in the roof admitted the rays of the  moon, mingling sadly with the single lamp which burned in the apartment.    'Seat yourself, Apaecides,' said the Egyptian, without rising.    The young man obeyed.    'You ask me,' resumed Arbaces, after a short pause, in which he seemed  absorbed in thought--'You ask me, or would do so, the mightiest secrets  which the soul of man is fitted to receive; it is the enigma of life  itself that you desire me to solve.  Placed like children in the dark,  and but for a little while, in this dim and confined existence, we shape  our spectres in the obscurity; our thoughts now sink back into ourselves  in terror, now wildly plunge themselves into the guideless gloom,  guessing what it may contain; stretching our helpless hands here and  there, lest, blindly, we stumble upon some hidden danger; not knowing  the limits of our boundary, now feeling them suffocate us with  compression, now seeing them extend far away till they vanish into  eternity.  In this state all wisdom consists necessarily in the solution  of two questions: \"What are we to believe? and What are we to reject?\"  These questions you desire me to decide.'    Apaecides bowed his head in assent.    'Man must have some belief,' continued the Egyptian, in a tone of  sadness. 'He must fasten his hope to something: is our common nature  that you inherit when, aghast and terrified to see that in which you  have been taught to place your faith swept away, you float over a dreary  and shoreless sea of incertitude, you cry for help, you ask for some  plank to cling to, some land, however dim and distant, to attain.  Well,  then, have not forgotten our conversation of to-day?'    'Forgotten!'    'I confessed to you that those deities for whom smoke so many altars  were but inventions.  I confessed to you that our rites and ceremonies  were but mummeries, to delude and lure the herd to their proper good.  I  explained to you that from those delusions came the bonds of society,  the harmony of the world, the power of the wise; that power is in the  obedience of the vulgar. Continue we then these salutary delusions--if  man must have some belief, continue to him that which his fathers have  made dear to him, and which custom sanctifies and strengthens.  In  seeking a subtler faith for us, whose senses are too spiritual for the  gross one, let us leave others that support which crumbles from  ourselves.  This is wise--it is benevolent.'    'Proceed.'    'This being settled,' resumed the Egyptian, 'the old landmarks being  left uninjured for those whom we are about to desert, we gird up our  loins and depart to new climes of faith.  Dismiss at once from your  recollection, from your thought, all that you have believed before.  Suppose the mind a blank, an unwritten scroll, fit to receive  impressions for the first time.  Look round the world--observe its  order--its regularity--its design.  Something must have created it--the  design speaks a designer: in that certainty we first touch land.  But  what is that something?--A god, you cry.  Stay--no confused  and confusing names.  Of that which created the world, we know,  we can know, nothing, save these attributes--power and unvarying  regularity--stern, crushing, relentless regularity--heeding no  individual cases--rolling--sweeping--burning on; no matter what  scattered hearts, severed from the general mass, fall ground and  scorched beneath its wheels. The mixture of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15663"],[0,"Ancient Egypt (#16)"],[1,"his time has come down to us  except the one that has been mentioned.    Antef I. is thought to have been succeeded by Mentu-hotep I., a monarch  even more shadowy, known to us only from the \"Table of Karnak.\" This  prince, however, is followed by one who possesses a greater amount of  substance--Antef-aa, or \"Antef the Great,\" grandson, as it would seem,  of the first Antef--a sort of Egyptian Nimrod, who delighted above all  things in the chase. Antefaa's sepulchral monument shows him to us  standing in the midst of his dogs, who wear collars, and have their  names engraved over them. The dogs are four in number, and are of  distinct types. The first, which is called _Mahut_ or \"Antelope,\" has  drooping ears, and long but somewhat heavy legs; it resembles a  foxhound, and was no doubt both swift and strong, though it can scarcely  have been so swift as its namesake. The second was called _Abakaru_, a  name of unknown meaning; it has pricked up, pointed ears, a pointed  nose, and a curly tail. Some have compared it with the German _spitz_  dog, but it seems rather to be the original dog of nature, a near  congener of the jackal, and the type to which all dogs revert when  allowed to run wild and breed indiscriminately. The third, named  _Pahats_ or _Kamu, i.e._ \"Blacky,\" is a heavy animal, not unlike a  mastiff; it has a small, rounded, drooping ear, a square, blunt nose, a  deep chest, and thick limbs. The late Dr. Birch supposed that it might  have been employed by Antefaa in \"the chase of the lion;\" but we should  rather regard it as a watch-dog, the terror of thieves, and we suspect  that the artist gave it the sitting attitude to indicate that its  business was not to hunt, but to keep watch and ward at its master's  gate. The fourth dog, who bears the name of _Tekal_, and walks between  his master's legs, has ears that seem to have been cropped. He has been  said to resemble \"the Dalmatian hound\": but this is questionable. His  peculiarities are not marked; but, on the whole, it seems most probable  that he is \"a pet house-dog\"[9] of the terrier class, the special  favourite of his master. Antefaa's dogs had their appointed keeper, the  master of his kennel, who is figured on the sepulchral tablet behind the  monarch, and bears the name of Tekenru.    The hunter king was buried in a tomb marked only by a pyramid of unbaked  brick, very humble in its character, but containing a mortuary chapel in  which the monument above described was set up. An inscription on the  tablet declared that it was erected to the memory of Antef the Great,  Son of the Sun, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, in the fiftieth year of  his reign.    Other Mentu-hoteps and other Antefs continued on the line of Theban  kings, reigning quietly and ingloriously, and leaving no mark upon the  scroll of time, yet probably advancing the material prosperity of their  country, and preparing the way for that rise to greatness which gives  Thebes, on the whole, the foremost place in Egyptian history. Useful  projects occupied the attention of these monarchs. One of them sank  wells in the valley of Hammamat, to provide water for the caravans which  plied between Coptos and the Red Sea. Another established military posts  in the valley to protect the traffic and the Egyptian quarrymen. Later  on, a king called Sankh-ka-ra launched a fleet upon the Red Sea waters,  and opened direct communications with the sacred land of Punt, the  region of odoriferous gums and of strange animals, as giraffes,  panthers, hunting leopards, cynocephalous apes, and long-tailed monkeys.  There is some doubt whether \"Punt\" was Arabia Felix, or the Somauli  country. In any case, it lay far down the Gulf, and could only be  reached after a voyage of many days.    The dynasty of the Antefs and Mentu-hoteps, which terminated with  Sankh-ka-ra, was followed by one in which the prevailing names were  Usurtasen and Amenemhat. This dynasty is Manetho's twelfth, and the time  of its rule has been characterized as \"the happiest age of Egyptian  history?\"[10] The second phase of Egyptian civilization now set in--a  phase which is regarded by many as outshining the glories of the first  The first civilization had subordinated the people to the monarch, and  had aimed especially at eternizing the memory and setting forth the  power and greatness of king after king. The second had the benefit and  advantage of the people for its primary object; it was utilitarian,  beneficent, appealing less to the eye than to the mind, far-sighted in  its aims, and most successful in the results which it effected. The wise  rulers of the time devoted their energies and their resources, not, as  the earlier kings, to piling up undying memorials of themselves in the  shape of monuments that \"reached to heaven,\" but to useful works, to the  excavation of wells and reservoirs, the making of roads, the  encouragement of commerce, and the development of the vast agricultural  wealth of the country. They also diligently guarded the frontiers,  chastised aggressive tribes, and checked invasion by the establishment  of strong fortresses in positions of importance. They patronized art,  employing themselves in building temples rather than tombs, and adorned  their temples not only with reliefs and statues, but also with the novel  architectural embellishment of the obelisk, a delicate form, and one  especially suited to the country.    The founder of the \"twelfth dynasty,\" Amenemhat I., deserves a few words  of description. He found Thebes in a state of anarchy; civil war raged  on every side; all the traditions of the past were forgotten; noble  fought against noble; the poor were oppressed; life and property were  alike insecure; \"there was stability of fortune neither for the ignorant  nor for the learned man.\" One night, after he had lain down to sleep, he  found himself attacked in his bed-chamber; the clang of arms sounded  near at hand. Starting from his couch, he seized his own weapons and  struck out; when lo! his assailants fled; detected in their attempt to  assassinate him, they dared not offer any resistance, thus showing  themselves alike treacherous and cowardly. Amenemhat, having once taken  arms, did not lay them down till he had defeated every rival, and so  fought his way to the crown. Once acknowledged as king, he ruled with  moderation and equity; he \"gave to the humble, and made the weak to  live;\" he \"caused the afflicted to cease from their afflictions, and  their cries to be heard no more;\" he brought it to pass that none  hungered or thirsted in the land; he gave such orders to his servants  as continually increased the love of his people towards him. At the same  time, he was an energetic warrior. He \"stood on the boundaries of the  land, to keep watch on its borders,\" personally leading his soldiers to  battle, armed with the _khopesh_ or falchion. He carried on wars with  the Petti, or bowmen of the Libyan interior, with the Sakti or Asiatics,  with the Maxyes or Mazyes of the north-west, and with the Ua-uat and  other negro tribes of the south; not, however, as it would seem, with  any desire of making conquests, but simply for the protection of his own  frontier. With the same object he constructed on his north-eastern  frontier a wall or fortress \"to keep out the Sakti,\" who continually  harassed the people of the Eastern Delta by their incursions.    The wars of Amenemhat I. make it evident that by his time Thebes had  advanced from the position of a petty kingdom situated in a remote part  of Egypt, and held in check by two or more rival kingdoms in the lower  Nile valley and the Delta, to that of a power which bore sway over the  whole land from Elephantine to the Mediterranean. \"I sent my messengers  up to Abu (Elephantine) and my couriers down to Athu\" (the coast lakes),  says the monarch in his \"Instructions\" to his son--the earliest literary  production from a royal pen that has come down to our days; and there is  no reason to doubt the truth of his statement. In the Delta alone could  he come into contact with either the Mazyes or the Sakti, and a king of  Thebes could not hold the Delta without being master also of the lower  Nile valley from Coptos to Memphis. We must regard Egypt, then, under  the \"twelfth dynasty.\" as once more consolidated into a single state--a  state ruled, however, not from Memphis, but from Thebes, a decidedly  inferior position.    [Illustration: SPEARING THE CROCODILE.]    Amenemhat I. is the only Egyptian king who makes a boast of his hunting  prowess. \"I hunted the lion,\" he says, \"and brought back the crocodile a  prisoner.\" Lions do not at the present time frequent Egypt, and, indeed,  are not found lower down the Nile valley than the point where the Great  Stream receives its last tributary, the Atbara. But anciently they seem  to have haunted the entire desert tracts on either side of the river.  The Roman Emperor Hadrian is said to have hunted one near Alexandria,  and the monuments represent lions as tamed and used in the chase by the  ancient inhabitants. Sometimes they even accompanied their masters to  the battlefield. We know nothing of Amenemhat's mode of hunting the king  of beasts, but may assume that it was not very different from that  which prevailed at a later date in Assyria. There, dogs and beaters were  employed to rouse the animals from their lairs, while the king and his  fellow-sportsmen either plied them with flights of arrows, or withstood  their onset with swords and spears. The crocodile was certainly  sometimes attacked while he was in the water, the hunters using a boat,  and endeavouring to spear him at the point where the head joins the  spine; but this could not have been the mode adopted by Amenemhat, since  it would have resulted in instant death, whereas he tells us that he  \"brought the crocodile home a prisoner.\" Possibly, therefore, he  employed the method which Herodotus says was in common use"]]]
