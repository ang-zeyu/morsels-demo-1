The knee is carried in advance, level with, or in front       of, a vertical line dropped from the point of the shoulder. The       hoof is usually rested on the toe, but when advanced beyond the       above mentioned vertical line, it may be placed flat on the ground,       the joints then being less markedly bent. When the limb as a whole       is flexed, it may be brought into normal position by thrusting back       the knee with sufficient force to counteract the action of the       flexor muscles.    [Illustration: Fig. 9--Merillat's method of fixing carpus in radial  paralysis. Courtesy, Alex. Eger.]    When made to walk, the animal being unable to exert muscular action with  the paralyzed structures, limply carries the member as a whole, and  there is shortening of the anterior portion of the stride. There being  loss of function of the triceps brachii, it is impossible for the  subject to straighten the leg in the normal position for supporting  weight; therefore, any attempt to bear weight results in further  flexion of the affected member and the animal will fall if the body is  not suddenly caught up with the sound leg.    Differential Diagnosis.--In making examination of these cases, one can  exclude fracture by absence of crepitation and usually, also, swelling  is absent in radial paralysis. In a typical case of radial paralysis,  the affected leg can sustain its normal share of weight if placed in  position, that is, if the carpal joint is extended in such manner that  the leg is positioned as in its normal weight-bearing attitude. In  brachial paralysis, whether due to fracture of the first rib or to other  serious injury, it is impossible for the subject to support weight with  the affected member even when it is passively placed in position.    No difficulty is ordinarily experienced in differentiating radial  paralysis from muscular injuries to the triceps; yet, in some cases of  \"dropped elbow,\" it is necessary to observe the progress of the case for  ten days or two weeks before one can positively establish a diagnosis.         Quoting Merillat[12]: \"When, after four weeks, there is no       amelioration of the paralysis, the muscles have atrophied, and the       patient has become emaciated from pain and discomfort, the       diagnosis of brachial paralysis with fracture of the first rib may       then be announced.\"    Prognosis.--When no complete paralysis of the brachial plexus or no  fracture of the first rib exists, the majority of cases recover  completely in from ten days to six weeks. Some writers claim that  recoveries occur in ninety per cent of cases when conditions are  favorable.    Treatment.--When incomplete radial paralysis exists, little needs be  done except to allow the subject moderate exercise and to provide for  its comfort. Local applications, stimulative in character, are  beneficial, and the internal administration of strychnin is indicated.    In the cases where weight is not supported without the affected leg  being passively placed in position, it is necessary to provide for the  subject's comfort in several ways.    Mechanical appliances such as braces of some kind in order to keep the  affected leg in a position of carpal extension, constitute the essential  part of treatment. The leg is supported in such a manner that flexion of  the carpus is impossible. Due regard is given to prevent chafing or  pressure necrosis by contact of the skin with the braces--this may be  done by bandaging with cotton. The supportive appliance is kept in  position for ten days or two weeks. At the end of this time the brace  may be removed and the subject given a chance to walk, and improvement,  if any exists, will be evident. When there is manifested an amelioration  of the condition, moderate daily exercise and massage of the affected  parts are helpful.    Should the subject be seriously inconvenienced by the application of a  brace or other supportive appliances, it is necessary to employ slings.  Further, if weight is supported entirely by the unaffected member,  laminitis may supervene if a sling is not used.      Thrombosis of the Brachial Artery.    Thrombosis of the brachial artery or of its principal branches is of  very rare occurrence in horses.    Etiology.--Partial or complete obstruction of arteries (brachial or  others) occurs as the result of direct injury to the vessel wall from  compression and tension of muscles and resultant arteritis; lodging of  emboli; and parasitic invasion of vessel walls causing internal  arteritis.    Symptomatology.--If sufficient collateral circulation exists to supply  the parts with blood, no inconvenience is manifested while the subject  is at rest. Where the lumen of the affected vessel is not completely  occluded, there may be no manifestation of lameness when the ailing  animal is moderately exercised. Consequently, the degree of lameness  depends upon the extent of the obstruction to circulation; and,  likewise, the course and prognosis depend upon the character and extent  of such obstruction.    In severe cases, lameness is markedly increased by causing the animal to  travel at a fast pace for only a short distance. There are evinced  symptoms of pain, muscular tremors and sudation, but the affected member  remains dry and there is a marked difference of temperature between the  normal areas and the cool anemic parts. When the subject is allowed to  rest, circulation is not taxed, and there is a return to the original  and apparently normal condition, only to recur again with exertion. This  condition characterizes thrombosis.    Treatment.--In these cases, little if any good directly results from  any sort of treatment in the way of medication. Absolute rest is thought  to be helpful. Potassium iodid, alkaline agents such as ammonium  carbonate and potassium carbonate, have been administered. Circulatory  stimulants also have been given, but it is doubtful if any good has come  from medication.      Fracture of Humerus.    The shaft of the humerus, protected as it is by heavy muscles, is not  frequently fractured; and fractures of its less protected parts, as for  example, the head, are complicated in such manner that resultant  arthritis soon constitutes the more serious condition.    As a result of falls on frozen ground, kicks or any other form of heavy  contusion, the humerus is occasionally broken. It is rarely fractured  otherwise. Because of the force of contusions usually required to effect  humeral fracture, the manner in which the bone is broken, with respect  to direction, is variable. Often oblique fractures exist and  occasionally there occurs multiple fracture. In addition to the  ordinarily serious nature of the fracture itself, there is always much  injury done the adjoining structures.    Symptomatology.--Mixed lameness and manifestation of severe pain  characterize this affection. Considerable swelling which increases, in  some cases for a week or more, is to be observed. Crepitation is readily  detected, if pain and swelling is not too great to prevent passive  movement of the member. Where intense pain is not manifested, because of  manipulation, one may abduct the extremity and thereby occasion distinct  crepitation; but when it is possible to recognize crepitation by holding  the hand in contact with the olecranon while the animal is made to walk,  this method is to be preferred, if the subject can move without serious  difficulty. The pathognomonic symptom here is recognition of  crepitation, but this may be very difficult to recognize in fracture of  condyles, and in such instances, a careful examination is necessary.  Gentle manipulation in a manner that pain is not aggravated will tend to  inspire confidence on the part of the subject and relaxation of muscles  will enable the operator to detect crepitation.    Course and Prognosis.--Because of the direction of the long axis of  the humerus, with relation to the bony column of the extremity, it is  obvious that any lateral movement of the leg tends to rotate the shaft  of this bone. In fractures of the shaft of the humerus, then, it is  apparent that immobilization is very difficult if at all possible.    The proximity to the axillary lymph glands makes for easy dissemination  of infection when the contused musculature becomes infected. The  adjacent brachial nerve plexus is so very apt to become involved, if not  actually injured at the time fracture occurs, that paralysis is a  probable complication. Consequently, it is logical to reason that  because of the many possible serious complications, such as shock,  occasioned by the injury and the distress and pain which this accident  produces, recovery must be the exception in fracture of the humerus.  However, recoveries do take place and in addition to the reported  recoveries by Liautard, Moller, Stockfleth, Lafosse, Frohner and others,  we have instances cited by American practitioners where cases resulted  in recovery. Thompson[13] reports a good recovery in a 1600-pound mare  where there existed an oblique fracture of the humerus. This mare was  kept in slings for eight weeks. Walters[14] reports complete recovery in  humeral fracture in a foal three days old. The only treatment given was  the application of a pitch plaster from the top of the scapula to the  radius. The colt was kept in a comfortable box stall and in about four  weeks regained use of the leg. Complete recovery eventually resulted. In  the experience of the author, recovery has not occurred in humeral  fractures.    Treatment.--When animals are not aged and of sufficient value to  justify treatment, they are best supported in a sling, if halter broken.  If subjects are nervous, wild and unbroken, it is possible to employ the  sling, if care is given to train the animal to this manner of restraint.  The presence of an attendant for a day or two will reassure such  subjects so that even in these cases it may be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#16)"],[1," any other perfume.    CASTOR is a secretion of the _Castor fiber_, or beaver, very  similar to civet. Though we have often heard of its being used in  perfumery, we do not personally know that such is the case.    MUSK.--This extraordinary substance, like civet, is an animal  secretion; it is contained in excretory follicles about the navel of the  male animal. In the perfumery trade these little bags are called \"pods,\"  and as imported it is called \"pod musk.\" When the musk is separated from  the skin or sack in which it is contained, it is then called \"grain  musk.\"    The musk deer (_Moschus moschatus_) is an inhabitant of the great  mountain range which belts the north of India, and branches out into  Siberia, Thibet, and China. And it is also found in the Altaic range,  near Lake Baikal, and in some other mountain ranges, but always on the  borders of the line of perpetual snow. It is from the male animal only  that the musk is produced.    [Illustration: Musk Pod, actual size.]    It formerly was held in high repute as a medicine, and is still so among  Eastern nations. The musk from Boutan, Tonquin, and Thibet, is most  esteemed, that from Bengal is inferior, and from Russia is of still  lower quality. The strength and the quantity produced by a single animal  varies with the season of the year and the age of the animal. A single  musk pod usually contains from two to three drachms of grain musk. Musk  is imported into England from China, in caddies of from 50 to 100 ounces  each. When adulterated with the animal's blood, which is often the case,  it forms into lumps or clots; it is sometimes also mixed with a dark,  friable earth. Those pods in which little pieces of lead are discovered,  as a general rule, yield the finest quality of musk; upon this rule, we  presume that the best musk is the most worthy of adulteration. Musk is  remarkable for the diffusiveness and subtlety of its scent; everything  in its vicinity soon becomes affected by it, and long retains its odor,  although not in actual contact with it.    It is a fashion of the present day for people to say \"that they do not  like musk;\" but, nevertheless, from great experience in one of the  largest manufacturing perfumatories in Europe, we are of opinion that  the public taste for musk is as great as any perfumer desires. Those  substances containing it always take the preference in ready sale--so  long as the vendor takes care to assure his customer \"that there is no  musk in it.\"    [Illustration: The Musk Deer.]    The perfumer uses musk principally in the scenting of soap, sachet  powder, and in mixing for liquid perfumery. The just reputation of  Paris's original Windsor soap is due, in the main, to its delightful  odor. The soap is, doubtless, of the finest quality, but its perfume  stamps it among the _elite_--its fragrance it owes to musk.    The alkaline reaction of soap is favorable to the development of the  odoriferous principle of musk. If, however, a strong solution of potass  be poured on to grain musk, ammonia is developed instead of the true  musk smell.    EXTRACT OF MUSK.    Grain musk,                2 oz.  Rectified spirit,      1 gallon.    After standing for one month, at a summer temperature, it is fit to draw  off. Such an extract is that which is used for mixing in other perfumes.  That extract of musk which is prepared for retail sale, is prepared  thus:--    EXTRAIT DE MUSC.    Extract of musk (as above),       1 pint.       \"     ambergris,             1/2 \"       \"   rose triple,             1/4 \"    Mix and filter it; it is then fit for bottling.    This preparation is sweeter than pure extract of musk made according to  our first formula, and is also more profitable to the vendor. It will be  seen hereafter that the original extract of musk is principally used for  a fixing ingredient in other perfumes, to give permanence to a volatile  odor; customers requiring, in a general way, that which is incompatible,  namely, that a perfume shall be strong to smell, _i.e._ very volatile,  and that it shall remain upon the handkerchief for a long period,  _ergo_, not volatile! Small portions of extract of musk, mixed with  esprit de rose, violet, tuberose, and others, do, in a measure, attain  this object; that is, after the violet, &c., has evaporated, the  handkerchief still retains an odor, which, although not that of the  original smell, yet gives satisfaction, because it is pleasant to the  nasal organ.          SECTION V.      AMMONIA.--Under the various titles of \"Smelling Salts,\"  \"Preston Salts,\" \"Inexhaustible Salts,\" \"Eau de Luce,\" \"Sal Volatile,\"  ammonia, mixed with other odoriferous bodies, has been very extensively  consumed as material for gratifying the olfactory nerve.    The perfumer uses liq. amm. fortis, that is, strong liquid ammonia, and  the sesqui-carbonate of ammonia, for preparing the various \"salts\" that  he sells. These materials he does not attempt to make; in fact, it is  quite out of his province so to do, but he procures them ready for his  hand through some manufacturing chemist. The best preparation for  smelling-bottles is what is termed INEXHAUSTIBLE SALTS, which  is prepared thus:--    Liquid ammonia,                  1 pint.  Otto of rosemary,              1 drachm.    \"     English lavender,      1 \"    \"     bergamot,            1/2 \"    \"     cloves,              1/2 \"    Mix the whole together with agitation in a very strong and  well-stoppered bottle.    This mixture is used by filling the smelling-bottles with any porous  absorbent material, such as asbestos, or, what is better, sponge  cuttings, that have been well beaten, washed, and dried. These cuttings  can be procured at a nominal price from any of the sponge-dealers,  being the trimming or roots of the Turkey sponge, which are cut off  before the merchants send it into the retail market. After the bottles  are filled with the sponge, it is thoroughly saturated with the scented  ammonia, but no more is poured in than the sponge will retain, when the  bottles are inverted; as, if by any chance the ammonia runs out and is  spilt over certain colored fabrics, it causes a stain. When such an  accident happens, the person who sold it is invariably blamed.    When the sponge is saturated properly, it will retain the ammoniacal  odor longer than any other material; hence, we presume, bottles filled  in this way are called \"inexhaustible,\" which name, however, they do not  sustain more than two or three months with any credit; the warm hand  soon dissipates the ammonia under any circumstances, and they require to  be refilled.    For transparent colored bottles, instead of sponge, the perfumers use  what they call insoluble crystal salts (sulphate of potass). The bottles  being filled with crystals, are covered either with the liquid ammonia,  scented as above, or with alcoholic ammonia. The necks of the bottles  are filled with a piece of white cotton; otherwise, when inverted, from  the non-absorbent quality of the crystals, the ammonia runs out, and  causes complaints to be made. The crystals are prettier in colored  bottles than the sponge; but in plain bottles the sponge appears quite  as handsome, and, as before observed, it holds the ammonia better than  any other material. Perfumers sell also what is called WHITE  SMELLING SALTS, and PRESTON SALTS. The White Smelling Salt  is the sesqui-carbonate of ammonia in powder, with which is mixed any  perfuming otto that is thought fit,--lavender otto giving, as a general  rule, the most satisfaction.    PRESTON SALTS, which is the cheapest of all the ammoniacal  compounds, is composed of some easily decomposable salt of ammonia and  lime, such as equal parts of muriate of ammonia, or of sesqui-carbonate  of ammonia, and of fresh-slaked lime. When the bottles are filled with  this compound, rammed in very hard, a drop or two of some cheap otto is  poured on the top prior to corking. For this purpose otto of French  lavender, or otto of bergamot, answers very well. We need scarcely  mention that the corks are dipped into melted sealing-wax, or brushed  over with liquid wax, that is, red or black wax dissolved in alcohol, to  which a small portion of ether is added. The only other compound of  ammonia that is sold in the perfumery trade is Eau de Luce, though  properly it belongs to the druggist. When correctly made--which is very  rarely the case--it retains the remarkable odor of oil of amber, which  renders it characteristic.    EAU DE LUCE.    Tincture of benzoin: or,    }     \"        balsam of Peru, }       1 oz.  Otto of lavender,               10 drops.  Oil of amber,                    5   \"  Liquor ammonia,                     2 oz.    If requisite, strain through cotton wool, but it must not be filtered,  as it should have the appearance of a milk-white emulsion.    ACETIC ACID AND ITS USE IN PERFUMERY.--The pungency of the odor  of vinegar naturally brought it into the earliest use in the art of  perfumery.    The acetic acid, evolved by distilling acetate of copper (verdigris), is  the true \"aromatic\" vinegar of the old alchemists.    The modern aromatic vinegar is the concentrated acetic acid aromatized  with various ottos, camphor, &c., thus--    AROMATIC VINEGAR.    Concentrated acetic acid,           8 oz.  Otto of English lavender,      2 drachms.   \"        \"     rosemary,       1 drachm.   \"      cloves,                 1   \"   \"      camphor,                    1 oz.    First dissolve the bruised camphor in the acetic acid, then add the  perfumes; after remaining together for a few days, with occasional  agitation, it is to be strained, and is then ready for use.    Several forms for the preparation of this substance have been published,  almost all of which, however, appear to complicate and mystify a process  that is all simplicity.    The most popular article of this kind is--    HENRY'S VINEGAR.    Dried leaves of rosemary, rue, wormwood, sage,   mint, "]]]
