[Illustration: The keeper spoke deep-chested words through the keyhole]    \"I don't open,\" said he, \"till you've gone over to the other side of the  tower. And if one of you comes at me I fire. Now!\"    \"We're all over on the other side,\" said the voices.    The keeper felt pleased with himself, and owned himself a bold man when  he threw open that door, and, stepping out into the leads, flashed the  full light of the stable lantern on the group of desperadoes standing  against the parapet on the other side of the tower.    He lowered his gun, and he nearly dropped the lantern.    \"So help me,\" he cried, \"if they ain't a pack of kiddies!\"    The Vicar now advanced.    \"How did you come here?\" he asked severely. \"Tell me at once.\"    \"Oh, take us down,\" said Jane, catching at his coat, \"and we'll tell you  anything you like. You won't believe us, but it doesn't matter. Oh, take  us down!\"    The others crowded round him, with the same entreaty. All but Cyril.  He had enough to do with the soda-water syphon, which would keep  slipping down under his jacket. It needed both hands to keep it steady  in its place.    But he said, standing as far out of the lantern light as possible--    \"Please do take us down.\"    So they were taken down. It is no joke to go down a strange church-tower  in the dark, but the keeper helped them--only, Cyril had to be  independent because of the soda-water syphon. It would keep trying to  get away. Half-way down the ladder it all but escaped. Cyril just caught  it by its spout, and as nearly as possible lost his footing. He was  trembling and pale when at last they reached the bottom of the winding  stair and stepped out on to the stones of the church-porch.    Then suddenly the keeper caught Cyril and Robert each by an arm.    \"You bring along the gells, sir,\" said he; \"you and Andrew can manage  them.\"    \"Let go!\" said Cyril; \"we aren't running away. We haven't hurt your old  church. Leave go!\"    \"You just come along,\" said the keeper; and Cyril dared not oppose him  with violence, because just then the syphon began to slip again.    So they were marched into the Vicarage study, and the Vicar's wife came  rushing in.    \"Oh, William, _are_ you safe?\" she cried.    Robert hastened to allay her anxiety.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"he's quite safe. We haven't hurt them at all. And  please, we're very late, and they'll be anxious at home. Could you send  us home in your carriage?\"    \"Or perhaps there's a hotel near where we could get a carriage,\" said  Anthea. \"Martha will be very anxious as it is.\"    The Vicar had sunk into a chair, overcome by emotion and amazement.    Cyril had also sat down, and was leaning forward with his elbows on his  knees because of the soda-water syphon.    \"But how did you come to be locked up in the church-tower?\" asked the  Vicar.    \"We went up,\" said Robert slowly, \"and we were tired, and we all went to  sleep, and when we woke up we found the door was locked, so we yelled.\"    \"I should think you did!\" said the Vicar's wife. \"Frightening everybody  out of their wits like this! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\"    \"We _are_,\" said Jane gently.    \"But who locked the door?\" asked the Vicar.    \"I don't know at all,\" said Robert, with perfect truth. \"Do please send  us home.\"    \"Well, really,\" said the Vicar, \"I suppose we'd better. Andrew, put the  horse to, and you can take them home.\"    \"Not alone, I don't,\" said Andrew to himself.    And the Vicar went on, \"let this be a lesson to you\"---- He went on  talking, and the children listened miserably. But the keeper was not  listening. He was looking at the unfortunate Cyril. He knew all about  poachers, of course, so he knew how people look when they're hiding  something. The Vicar had just got to the part about trying to grow up  to be a blessing to your parents, and not a trouble and disgrace, when  the keeper suddenly said--    \"Arst him what he's got there under his jacket;\" and Cyril knew that  concealment was at an end. So he stood up, and squared his shoulders and  tried to look noble, like the boys in books that no one can look in the  face of and doubt that they come of brave and noble families, and will  be faithful to the death, and he pulled out the syphon and said--    \"Well, there you are, then.\"    There was silence. Cyril went on--there was nothing else for it--    \"Yes, we took this out of your larder, and some chicken and tongue and  bread. We were very hungry, and we didn't take the custard or jam. We  only took bread and meat and water,--and we couldn't help its being soda  kind,--just the necessaries of life; and we left half-a-crown to pay for  it, and we left a letter. And we're very sorry. And my father will pay a  fine and anything you like, but don't send us to prison. Mother would  be so vexed. You know what you said about not being a disgrace. Well,  don't you go and do it to us--that's all! We're as sorry as we can be.  There!\"    \"However did you get up to the larder window?\" said Mrs. Vicar.    \"I can't tell you that,\" said Cyril firmly.    \"Is this the whole truth you've been telling me?\" asked the clergyman.    \"No,\" answered Jane suddenly; \"it's all true, but it's not the whole  truth. We can't tell you that. It's no good asking. Oh, do forgive us  and take us home!\" She ran to the Vicar's wife and threw her arms round  her. The Vicar's wife put her arms round Jane, and the keeper whispered  behind his hand to the Vicar--    \"They're all right, sir--I expect it's a pal they're standing by.  Someone put 'em up to it, and they won't peach. Game little kids.\"    \"Tell me,\" said the Vicar kindly, \"are you screening someone else? Had  anyone else anything to do with this?\"    \"Yes,\" said Anthea, thinking of the Psammead; \"but it wasn't their  fault.\"    \"Very well, my dears,\" said the Vicar, \"then let's say no more about it.  Only just tell us why you wrote such an odd letter.\"    \"I don't know,\" said Cyril. \"You see, Anthea wrote it in such a hurry,  and it really didn't seem like stealing then. But afterwards, when we  found we couldn't get down off the church-tower, it seemed just exactly  like it. We are all very sorry\"--    \"Say no more about it,\" said the Vicar's wife; \"but another time just  think before you take other people's tongues. Now--some cake and milk  before you go home?\"    When Andrew came to say that the horse was put to, and was he expected  to be led alone into the trap that he had plainly seen from the first,  he found the children eating cake and drinking milk and laughing at the  Vicar's jokes. Jane was sitting on the Vicar's wife's lap.    So you see they got off better than they deserved.    The gamekeeper, who was the cook's cousin, asked leave to drive home  with them, and Andrew was only too glad to have someone to protect him  from that trap he was so certain of.    When the wagonette reached their own house, between the chalk-quarry and  the gravel-pit, the children were very sleepy, but they felt that they  and the keeper were friends for life.    Andrew dumped the children down at the iron gate without a word.    \"You get along home,\" said the Vicarage cook's cousin, who was a  gamekeeper. \"I'll get me home on shanks' mare.\"    So Andrew had to drive off alone, which he did not like at all, and it  was the keeper that was cousin to the Vicarage cook who went with the  children to the door, and, when they had been swept to bed in a  whirlwind of reproaches, remained to explain to Martha and the cook and  the housemaid exactly what had happened. He explained so well that  Martha was quite amicable the next morning.    After that he often used to come over and see Martha, and in the  end--but that is another story, as dear Mr. Kipling says.    Martha was obliged to stick to what she had said the night before about  keeping the children indoors the next day for a punishment. But she  wasn't at all ugly about it, and agreed to let Robert go out for half an  hour to get something he particularly wanted.    This, of course, was the day's wish.    Robert rushed to the gravel-pit, found the Psammead, and presently  wished for--    But that, too, is another story.          CHAPTER VI    A CASTLE AND NO DINNER      The others were to be kept in as a punishment for the misfortunes of the  day before. Of course Martha thought it was naughtiness, and not  misfortune--so you must not blame her. She only thought she was doing  her duty. You know, grown-up people often say they do not like to punish  you, and that they only do it for your own good, and that it hurts them  as much as it hurts you--and this is really very often the truth.    Martha certainly hated having to punish the children quite as much as  they hated to be punished. For one thing, she knew what a noise there  would be in the house all day. And she had other reasons.    \"I declare,\" she said to the cook, \"it seems almost a shame keeping of  them indoors this lovely day; but they are that audacious, they'll be  walking in with their heads knocked off some of these days, if I don't  put my foot down. You make them a cake for tea to-morrow, dear. And  we'll have Baby along of us soon as we've got a bit forrard with our  work. Then they can have a good romp with him, out of the way. Now,  Eliza, come, get on with them beds. Here's ten o'clock nearly, and no  rabbits caught!\"    People say that in Kent when they mean \"and no work done.\"    So all the others were kept in, but Robert, as I have said, was allowed  to go out for half an hour to get something they all wanted. And that,  of course, was the day's wish.    He had no difficulty in finding the Sand-fairy, for the day was already  so hot that it had actually, for the first time, come out of its own  accord, and was sitting in a sort of pool of soft sand, stretching  itself, and trimming its whiskers, and turning its snail's eyes round  and round.    \"Ha!\" it said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17321"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria in the Light of Recent (#16)"],[1,"ness, did not exist till  long after the time of the IVth and Vth Dynasties.    [Illustration: 100.jpg STATUE NO. 1 OF THE CAIRO MUSEUM, About 3900  B.C.]    The kings of the XIIth Dynasty especially were most careful that their  statues should be accurate portraits; indeed, the portraits of Usertsen  (Senusret) III vary from a young face to an old one, showing that the  king was faithfully depicted at different periods of his life.    But the general conventions of dress and deportment were finally fixed  under the Vth Dynasty. After this time we no longer have such absolutely  faithful and original presentments as the other little ivory statuette  found by Prof. Petrie at Abydos (now in the British Museum), which shows  us an aged monarch of the Ist Dynasty. It is obvious that the features  are absolutely true to life, and the figure wears an unconventionally  party-coloured and bordered robe of a kind which kings of a later day  may have worn in actual life, but which they would assuredly never be  depicted as wearing by the artists of their day. To the end of Egyptian  history, the kings, even the Roman emperors, were represented on the  monuments clothed in the official costume of their ancestors of the IVth  and Vth Dynasties, in the same manner as we see Khufu wearing his robe  in the little figure from Abydos, and Ne-user-Ra on the great  relief from Abusir. There are one or two exceptions, such as the  representations of the original genius Akhunaten at Tell el-Amarna and  the beautiful statue of Ramses II at Turin, in which we see these kings  wearing the real costume of their time, but such exceptions are very  rare.    The art of Abusir is therefore of great interest, since it marks the end  of the development of the priestly art. Secular art might develop as it  liked, though the crystallizing influence of the ecclesiastical canon is  always evident here also. But henceforward it was an impiety, which only  an Akhunaten could commit, to depict a king or a god on the walls of a  temple otherwise (except so far as, the portrait was concerned) than as  he had been depicted in the time of the Vth Dynasty.    Other buildings have been excavated by the Germans at Abusir, notably  the usual town of mastaba-tombs belonging to the chief dignitaries of  the reign, which is always found at the foot of a royal pyramid of this  period. Another building of the highest interest, belonging to the same  age, was also excavated, and its true character was determined. This is  a building at a place called er-Righa or Abu Ghuraib, \"Father of Crows,\"  between Abusir and Giza. It was formerly supposed to be a pyramid, but  the German excavations have shown that it is really a temple of the  Sun-god Ra of Heliopolis, specially venerated by the kings of the Vth  Dynasty, who were of Heliopolitan origin. The great pyramid-builders of  the IVth Dynasty seem to have been the last true Memphites. At the end  of the reign of Shepseskaf, the last monarch of the dynasty, the sceptre  passed to a Heliopolitan family. The following VIth Dynasty may again  have been Memphite, but this is uncertain. The capital continued to be  Memphis, and from the beginning of the Hid Dynasty to the end of the Old  Kingdom and the rise of Herakle-opolis and Thebes, Memphis remained the  chief city of Egypt.    The Heliopolitans were naturally the servants of the Sun-god above all  other gods, and they were the first to call themselves \"Sons of the  Sun,\" a title retained by the Pharaohs throughout all subsequent  history. It was Ne-user-Ra who built the Sun-temple of Abu Ghuraib,  on the edge of the desert, north of his pyramid and those of his two  immediate predecessors at Abusir. As now laid bare by the excavations of  1900, it is seen to consist of an artificial mound, with a great court  in front to the eastward. On the mound was erected a truncated obelisk,  the stone emblem of the Sun-god. The worshippers in the court below  looked towards the Sun's stone erected upon its mound in the west,  the quarter of the sun's setting; for the Sun-god of Heliopolis was  primarily the setting sun, Tum-Ra, not Ra Harmachis, the rising sun,  whose emblem is the Great Sphinx at Giza, which looks towards the east.  The sacred emblem of the Heliopolitan Sun-god reminds us forcibly of the  Semitic _bethels_ or _baetyli_, the sacred stones of Palestine, and may  give yet another hint of the Semitic origin of the Heliopolitan cult.  In the court of the temple is a huge circular altar of fine alabaster,  several feet across, on which slain oxen were offered to the Sun, and  behind this, at the eastern end of the court, are six great basins of  the same stone, over which the beasts were slain, with drains running  out of them by which their blood was carried away. This temple is a most  interesting monument of the civilization of the \"Old Kingdom\" at the time  of the Vth Dynasty.    At Sakkara itself, which lies a short distance south of Abusir, no new  royal tombs have, as has been said, been discovered of late years. But a  great deal of work has been done among the private mastaba-tombs by the  officers of the _Service des Antiquites_, which reserves to itself the  right of excavation here and at Dashur. The mastaba of the sage and  writer Kagernna (or rather Gemnika, \"I-have-found-a-ghost,\" which  sounds very like an American Indian appellation) is very fine.  \"I-have-found-a-ghost\" lived in the reign of the king Tatkara Assa, the  \"Tancheres\" of Manetho, and he wrote maxims like his great contemporary  Phtahhetep (\"Offered to Phtah\"), who was also buried at Sakkara. The  officials of the _Service des Antiquites_ who cleaned the tomb unluckily  misread his name Ka-bi-n (an impossible form which could only mean,  literally translated, \"Ghost-soul-of\" or \"Ghost-soul-to-me\"), and they  have placed it in this form over the entrance to his tomb. This mastaba,  like those, already known, of Mereruka (sometimes misnamed \"Mera\")  and the famous Ti, both also at Sakkara, contains a large number of  chambers, ornamented with reliefs. In the vicinity M. Grebaut, then  Director of the Service of Antiquities, discovered a very interesting  Street of Tombs, a regular Via Sacra, with rows of tombs of the  dignitaries of the VIth Dynasty on either side of it. They are generally  very much like one another; the workmanship of the reliefs is fine, and  the portrait of the owner of the tomb is always in evidence.    Several of the smaller mastabas have lately been disposed of to the  various museums, as they are liable to damage if they remain where they  stand; moreover, they are not of great value to the Museum of Cairo,  but are of considerable value to various museums which do not already  possess complete specimens of this class of tombs. A fine one, belonging  to the chief Uerarina, is now exhibited in the Assyrian Basement of the  British Museum; another is in the Museum of Leyden; a third at Berlin,  and so on. Most of these are simple tombs of one chamber. In the centre  of the rear wall we always see the _stele_ or gravestone proper,  built into the fabric of the tomb. Before this stood the low table  of offerings with a bowl for oblations, and on either side a tall  incense-altar. From the altar the divine smoke (_senetr_) arose when  the _hen-ka_, or priest of the ghost (literally, \"Ghost's Servant\"),  performed his duty of venerating the spirits of the deceased, while the  _Kher-heb_, or cantor, enveloped in the mystic folds of the leopard-skin  and with bronze incense-burner in hand, sang the holy litanies and  spells which should propitiate the ghost and enable him to win his way  to ultimate perfection in the next world.    The stele is always in the form of a door with pyloni-form cornice. On  either side is a figure of the deceased, and at the sides are carved  prayers to Anubis, and at a later date to Osiris, who are implored to  give the funerary meats and \"everything good and pure on which the god  there (as the dead man in the tomb has been constituted) lives;\" often  we find that the biography and list of honorary titles and dignities of  the deceased have been added.    Sakkara was used as a place of burial in the latest as well as in the  earliest time. The Egyptians of the XXVIth Dynasty, wearied of the long  decadence and devastating wars which had followed the glorious epoch of  the conquering Pharaohs of the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties, turned for  a new and refreshing inspiration to the works of the most ancient kings,  when Egypt was a simple self-contained country, holding no intercourse  with outside lands, bearing no outside burdens for the sake of pomp and  glory, and knowing nothing of the decay and decadence which follows in  the train of earthly power and grandeur. They deliberately turned their  backs on the worn-out and discredited imperial trappings of the Thothmes  and Ramses, and they took the supposed primitive simplicity of the  Snefrus, the Khufus, and the Ne-user-Ras for a model and ensampler to  their lives. It was an age of conscious and intended archaism, and in  pursuit of the archaistic ideal the Mem-phites of the Saite age had  themselves buried in the ancient necropolis of Sakkara, side by side  with their ancestors of the time of the Vth and VIth Dynasties. Several  of these tombs have lately been discovered and opened, and fitted with  modern improvements. One or two of them, of the Persian period, have  wells (leading to the sepulchral chamber) of enormous depth, down which  the modern tourist is enabled to descend by a spiral iron staircase. The  Serapeum itself is lit with electricity, and in the Tombs of the Kings  at Thebes nothing disturbs the silence but the steady thumping pulsation  of the dynamo-engine which lights the ancient sepulchres of the  Pharaohs. Thus do modern ideas and inventions help us to see and so to  understand better the works of ancient Egypt. But it is perhaps a little  too much like the"]]]
