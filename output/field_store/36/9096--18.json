If they serve neither of these purposes they  are worse than useless; they only help fill space which would look  better empty, or gather dust and make work to keep them clean.    A room filled with quantities of trifling ornaments has the look of  a bazaar and displays neither good taste nor good sense. Artistic  excellence aims to have all the furnishings of a high order of  workmanship combined with simplicity, while good sense understands the  folly of dusting a lot of rubbish.    A poor book had best be burned to give place to a better, or even to  an empty shelf, for the fire destroys its poison, and puts it out of  the way of doing harm.    Better economize in the purchasing of furniture or carpets than scrimp  in buying good books or papers.    Our sitting-rooms need never be empty of guests or our libraries of  society if the company of good books is admitted to them.      REMARKABLE CALCULATIONS REGARDING THE SUN.    The sun's average distance from the earth is about 91,500,000 miles.  Since the orbit of the earth is elliptical, and the sun is situated at  one of its foci, the earth is nearly 3,000,000 miles further from  the sun in aphelion than in perihelion. As we attempt to locate the  heavenly bodies in space, we are immediately startled by the enormous  figures employed. The first number, 91,500,000 miles, is far beyond  our grasp. Let us try to comprehend it. If there were air to convey a  sound from the sun to the earth, and a noise could be made loud enough  to pass that distance it would require over fourteen years for it to  come to us. Suppose a railroad could be built to the sun. An express  train traveling day and night at the rate of thirty miles an hour,  would require 341 years to reach its destination. Ten generations  would be born and would die; the young men would become gray haired,  and their great-grandchildren would forget the story of the beginning  of that wonderful journey, and could find it only in history, as we  now read of Queen Elizabeth or of Shakespeare; the eleventh generation  would see the solar depot at the end of the route. Yet this enormous  distance of 91,500,000 miles is used as the unit for expressing  celestial distances--as the foot-rule for measuring space; and  astronomers speak of so many times the sun's distance as we speak of  so many feet or inches.    SIGNS OF STORMS APPROACHING.--A ring around the sun or moon stands for  an approaching storm, its near or distant approach being indicated by  its larger or smaller circumference. When the sun rises brightly and  immediately afterward becomes veiled with clouds, the farmer distrusts  the day. Rains which begin early in the morning often stop by nine  in place of \"eleven,\" the hour specified in the old saw, \"If it rains  before seven.\"    On a still, quiet day, with scarcely the least wind afloat, the  ranchman or farmer can tell the direction of impending storm by cattle  sniffing the air in the direction whence it is coming. Lack of dew in  summer is a rain sign. Sharp white frosts in autumn and winter precede  damp weather, and we will stake our reputation as a prophet that three  successive white frosts are an infallible sign of rain. Spiders do not  spin their webs out of doors before rain. Previous to rain flies sting  sharper, bees remain in their hives or fly but short distances, and  almost all animals appear uneasy.      HOW TO DISTINGUISH GOOD MEAT FROM BAD MEAT.    1st. It is neither of a pale pink color nor of a deep purple tint,  for the former is a sign of disease, and the latter indicates that the  animal has not been slaughtered, but has died with the blood in it, or  has suffered from acute fever.    2d. It has a marked appearance from the ramifications of little veins  of fat among the muscles.    3d. It should be firm and elastic to the touch and should scarcely  moisten the fingers--bad meat being wet and sodden and flabby with the  fat looking like jelly or wet parchment.    4th. It should have little or no odor, and the odor should not be  disagreeable, for diseased meat has a sickly cadaverous smell, and  sometimes a smell of physic. This is very discoverable when the meat  is chopped up and drenched with warm water.    5th. It should not shrink or waste much in cooking.    6th. It should not run to water or become very wet on standing for a  day or two, but should, on the contrary, dry upon the surface.    7th. When dried at a temperature of 212 deg., or thereabouts, it  should not lose more than from 70 to 74 per cent. of its weight,  whereas bad meat will often lose as much as 80 per cent. The juice of  the flesh is alkaline or neutral to test paper.      RAILROADS IN FINLAND.    People who think of Finland as a sub-arctic country of bleak and  forbidding aspect maybe surprised to hear that several railroads have  already made a large part of the region accessible. A new line, 160  miles long, has just been opened to the heart of the country in the  midst of great forests and perhaps the most wonderful lake region in  the world. Sportsmen are now within less than a day's journey from St.  Petersburg of central Finland, where there is the best of hunting and  fishing and twenty hours of sunlight every summer day. The most unique  of railroads, however, is still the little line in Norway, north of  the arctic circle, carrying the product of far northern mines to the  sea, and famous as the only railroad that has yet invaded the polar  regions.      COMPARATIVE SIZE OF THE ARK AND THE GREAT EASTERN.    The following comparison between the size of Noah's ark and the Great  Eastern, both being considered in point of tonnage, after the old law  for calculating the tonnage of a vessel, exhibits a remarkable  similarity. The cubit of the Bible, according to Sir Isaac Newton, is  20-1/2 inches, or, to be exact, 20.625 inches. Bishop Wilkins makes the  cubit 20.88 inches. According to Newton the dimensions of the ark were:  Length between perpendiculars, 515.62 feet; breadth, 84.94 feet; depth,  51.56 feet; keel, or length for tonnage, 464.08 feet. Tonnage, according  to old law, 18,231 58-94. The measurements of the ark, according to  Wilkins' calculations were: Length, 54700 feet; breadth, 91.16 feet;  depth, 54.70 feet; keel, 492.31 feet. Tonnage, 21,761. Notice how  surprisingly near the Great Eastern came to being constructed after the  same plan: Length, 680 feet; breadth, 83 feet; depth, 60 feet; keel, 630  feet. Tonnage, 23,092.      FINGER NAILS AS AN INDICATION OF CHARACTER.    A white mark on the nail bespeaks misfortune.    Pale or lead-colored nails indicate melancholy people.    Broad nails indicate a gentle, timid, and bashful nature.    Lovers of knowledge and liberal sentiments have round nails.    People with narrow nails are ambitious and quarrelsome.    Small nails indicate littleness of mind, obstinacy and conceit.    Choleric, martial men, delighting in war, have red and spotted nails.    Nails growing into the flesh at the points or sides indicate luxurious  tastes.    People with very pale nails are subject to much infirmity of the flesh  and persecution by neighbors and friends.      DANGERS OF CELLULOID.    A curious accident, which happened recently in Paris, points out a  possible danger in the wearing of combs and bracelets of celluloid. A  little girl sat down before the fire to prepare her lessons. Her hair  was kept back by a semi-circle comb of celluloid. As her head was bent  forward to the fire this became warm, and suddenly burst into flames.  The child's hair was partly burned off, and the skin of the head was  so injured that several months after, though the burn was healed, the  cicatrix formed a white patch on which no hair would grow. The burning  point of celluloid is about 180 degrees, and the comb worn by the girl  had attained that heat as it was held before the fire.      ODD FACTS ABOUT SHOES.    Grecian shoes were peculiar in reaching to the middle of the legs.    The present fashion of shoes was introduced into England in 1633.    In the ninth and tenth centuries the greatest princes of Europe wore  wooden shoes.    Slippers were in use before Shakespeare's time, and were originally  made \"rights\" and \"lefts.\"    Shoes among the Jews were made of leather, linen, rush or wood;  soldiers' shoes were sometimes made of brass or iron.    In the reign of William Rufus of England, in the eleventh century,  a great beau, \"Robert, the Horned,\" used shoes with sharp points,  stuffed with tow, and twisted like rams' horns.    The Romans made use of two kinds of shoes--the solea, or sandal, which  covered the sole of the foot, and was worn at home and in company, and  the calceus, which covered the whole foot and was always worn with the  toga when a person went abroad.    In the reign of Richard II., shoes were of such absurd length as  to require to be supported by being tied to the knees with chains,  sometimes of gold and silver. In 1463 the English parliament took the  matter in hand and passed an act forbidding shoes with spikes more  than two inches in length being worn and manufactured.

He took his valet Parnham with him, and  quitted Worth one morning before lunch, bidding us an unceremonious  adieu, though he kissed Constance with some apparent tenderness. It was  the first time for three months, she confessed to me afterwards, that  he had shown her even so ordinary a mark of affection; and her wounded  heart treasured up what she hoped would prove a token of returning love.  He had not proposed to take her with him, and even had he done so, we  should have been reluctant to assent, as signs were not wanting that it  might have been imprudent for her to undertake foreign travel at that  period.    For nearly a month we had no word of him. Then he wrote a short note to  Constance from Naples, giving no news, and indeed, scarce speaking of  himself at all, but mentioning as an address to which she might write if  she wished, the Villa de Angelis at Posilipo. Though his letter was cold  and empty, yet Constance was delighted to get it, and wrote henceforth  herself nearly every day, pouring out her heart to him, and retailing  such news as she thought would cheer him.          CHAPTER XI      A month later Mrs. Temple wrote to John warning him of the state in  which Constance now found herself, and begging him to return at least  for a few weeks in order that he might be present at the time of her  confinement. Though it would have been in the last degree unkind, or  even inhuman, that a request of this sort should have been refused, yet  I will confess to you that my brother's recent strangeness had prepared  me for behaviour on his part however wild; and it was with a feeling of  extreme relief that I heard from Mrs. Temple a little later that she had  received a short note from John to say that he was already on his return  journey. I believe Mrs. Temple herself felt as I did in the matter,  though she said nothing.    When he returned we were all at Royston, whither Mrs. Temple had taken  Constance to be under Dr. Dobie's care. We found John's physical  appearance changed for the worse. His pallor was as remarkable as  before, but he was visibly thinner; and his strange mental abstraction  and moodiness seemed little if any abated. At first, indeed, he greeted  Constance kindly or even affectionately. She had been in a terrible  state of anxiety as to the attitude he would assume towards her, and  this mental strain affected prejudicially her very delicate bodily  condition. His kindness, of an ordinary enough nature indeed, seemed  to her yearning heart a miracle of condescending love, and she was  transported with the idea that his affection to her, once so sincere,  was indeed returning. But I grieve to say that his manner thawed only  for a very short time, and ere long he relapsed into an attitude of  complete indifference. It was as if his real, true, honest, and loving  character had made one more vigorous effort to assert itself,--as  though it had for a moment broken through the hard and selfish crust  that was forming around him; but the blighting influence which was at  work proved seemingly too strong for him to struggle against, and  riveted its chains again upon him with a weight heavier than before.  That there was some malefic influence, mental or physical, thus working  on him, no one who had known him before could for a moment doubt. But  while Mrs. Temple and I readily admitted this much, we were entirely  unable even to form a conjecture as to its nature. It is true that  Mrs. Temple's fancy suggested that Constance had some rival in his  affections; but we rejected such a theory almost before it was proposed,  feeling that it was inherently improbable, and that, had it been true,  we could not have remained entirely unaware of the circumstances which  had conduced to such a state of things. It was this inexplicable nature  of my brother's affliction that added immeasurably to our grief. If we  could only have ascertained its cause we might have combated it; but  as it was, we were fighting in the dark, as against some enemy who was  assaulting us from an obscurity so thick that we could not see his form.  Of any mental trouble we thus knew nothing, nor could we say that my  brother was suffering from any definite physical ailment, except that  he was certainly growing thinner.    Your birth, my dear Edward, followed very shortly. Your poor mother  rallied in an unusually short time, and was filled with rapture at the  new treasure which was thus given as a solace to her afflictions. Your  father exhibited little interest at the event, though he sat nearly half  an hour with her one evening, and allowed her even to stroke his hair  and caress him as in time long past. Although it was now the height of  summer he seldom left the house, sitting much and sleeping in his own  room, where he had a field-bed provided for him, and continually  devoting himself to the violin.    One evening near the end of July we were sitting after dinner in the  drawing-room at Royston, having the French windows looking on to the  lawn open, as the air was still oppressively warm. Though things were  proceeding as indifferently as before, we were perhaps less cast down  than usual, for John had taken his dinner with us that evening. This was  a circumstance now, alas! sufficiently uncommon, for he had nearly all  his meals served for him in his own rooms. Constance, who was once more  downstairs, sat playing at the pianoforte, performing chiefly melodies  by Scarlatti or Bach, of which old-fashioned music she knew her husband  to be most fond. A later fashion, as you know, has revived the  cultivation of these composers, but at the time of which I write their  works were much less commonly known. Though she was more than a passable  musician, he would not allow her to accompany him; indeed he never now  performed at all on the violin before us, reserving his practice  entirely for his own chamber. There was a pause in the music while  coffee was served. My brother had been sitting in an easy-chair apart  reading some classical work during his wife's performance, and taking  little notice of us. But after a while he put down his book and said,  \"Constance, if you will accompany me, I will get my violin and play a  little while.\" I cannot say how much his words astonished us. It was  so simple a matter for him to say, and yet it filled us all with an  unspeakable joy. We concealed our emotion till he had left the room to  get his instrument, then Constance showed how deeply she was gratified  by kissing first her mother and then me, squeezing my hand but saying  nothing. In a minute he returned, bringing his violin and a music-book.  By the soiled vellum cover and the shape I perceived instantly that it  was the book containing the \"Areopagita.\" I had not seen it for near  two years, and was not even aware that it was in the house, but I  knew at once that he intended to play that suite. I entertained an  unreasoning but profound aversion to its melodies, but at that moment  I would have welcomed warmly that or any other music, so that he would  only choose once more to show some thought for his neglected wife. He  put the book open at the \"Areopagita\" on the desk of the pianoforte,  and asked her to play it with him. She had never seen the music before,  though I believe she was not unacquainted with the melody, as she had  heard him playing it by himself, and once heard, it was not easily  forgotten.    They began the \"Areopagita\" suite, and at first all went well. The  tone of the violin, and also, I may say with no undue partiality,  my brother's performance, were so marvellously fine that though our  thoughts were elsewhere when, the music commenced, in a few seconds they  were wholly engrossed in the melody, and we sat spellbound. It was as  if the violin had become suddenly endowed with life, and was singing  to us in a mystical language more deep and awful than any human words.  Constance was comparatively unused to the figuring of the _basso  continuo_, and found some trouble in reading it accurately, especially  in manuscript; but she was able to mask any difficulty she may have had  until she came to the _Gagliarda_. Here she confessed to me her thoughts  seemed against her will to wander, and her attention became too deeply  riveted on her husband's performance to allow her to watch her own.  She made first one slight fault, and then growing nervous, another, and  another. Suddenly John stopped and said brusquely, \"Let Sophy play,  I cannot keep time with you.\" Poor Constance! The tears came swiftly  to my own eyes when I heard him speak so thoughtlessly to her, and I was  almost provoked to rebuke him openly. She was still weak from her recent  illness; her nerves were excited by the unusual pleasure she felt in  playing once more with her husband, and this sudden shattering of her  hopes of a renewed tenderness proved more than she could bear: she put  her head between her hands upon the keyboard and broke into a paroxysm  of tears.    We both ran to her; but while we were attempting to assuage her grief,  John shut his violin into its case, took the music-book under his arm,  and left the room without saying a word to any of us, not even to the  weeping girl, whose sobs seemed as though they would break her heart.    We got her put to bed at once, but it was some hours before her  convulsive sobbing ceased. Mrs. Temple had administered to her a  soothing draught of proved efficacy, and after sitting with her till  after one o'clock, I left her at last dozing off to sleep, and myself  sought repose. I was quite wearied out with the weight of my anxiety,  and with the crushing bitterness of seeing my dearest Constance's  feelings so wounded. Yet in spite, or rather perhaps on account of my  trouble, my head had scarcely touched my pillow ere I fell into a deep  sleep.    A room in the south wing had been converted for the nonce into a  nursery, and for the"]]]
