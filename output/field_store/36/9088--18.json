And this is the sense of pastor and people which the  Holy Ghost useth, setting forth the reciprocal relation and office  between them, with his own approbation. \"Let him that is catechized in  the word, communicate to him that catechizeth him, in all good things,\"  Gal. vi. 6.    4. The administration of the sacraments is of divine institution.    1. Of baptism. \"He that sent me to baptize with water,\" John i. 33. \"Go  ye therefore, disciple ye all nations, baptizing them into the name of  the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,\" Matt, xxviii. 18-20.    2. Of the Lord's supper, which Christ ordained _the same night in which  he was betrayed_: which institution is at large described, 1 Cor. xi.  20, 23, &c.; Matt. xxvi. 26-31; Mark xiv. 22-27; Luke xxii. 19, 20.    2. Ordinances appertaining to the key of jurisdiction or of discipline,  viz:    1. The ordination of presbyters with imposition of the hands of the  presbytery, after praying and fasting, is a divine ordinance. \"Neglect  not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy with the  laying on of the hands of the presbytery,\" 1 Tim. iv. 14. Titus was left  in Crete for this end, \"To set in order things that were wanting, and  ordain presbyters\" (or elders) \"in every city, as Paul had appointed  him,\" Tit. i. 5. Timothy is charged, \"Lay hands suddenly on no man,  neither be partaker of other men's sins; keep thyself pure,\" 1 Tim. v.  22. Paul and Barnabas came to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, and \"when  they had ordained them presbyters in every church, and had prayed with  fasting, they commended them to the Lord,\" &c., Acts xiv. 21, 23.    2. Authoritative discerning, and judging of doctrine according to the  word of God, is a divine ordinance. As that council at Jerusalem,  authoritatively (viz. by ministerial authority) judged of both the false  doctrine and manners of false teachers, branding them for \"troublers of  the Church, subverters of souls,\" &c. \"Forasmuch as we have heard that  certain, coming forth from u, have troubled you with words, subverting  your souls, saying, ye ought to be circumcised, and keep the law, to  whom we gave no such commandment,\" Acts xv. 24; \"it seemed good to the  Holy Ghost, and to us, to impose upon you no greater burden than these  necessary things,\" v. 28; and this was done upon debates from scripture  grounds, \"and to this the words of the prophets agree,\" Acts xv. 15:  and afterwards their results and determinations are called \"decrees  ordained by the apostles and elders,\" Acts xvi. 4.    3. Admonition and public rebuke of sinners is a divine ordinance of  Christ. \"If thy brother trespass against thee, go and tell him his  fault between thee and him alone: if he will not hear thee, then take  with thee one or two more--and if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it  unto the Church,\" Matt, xviii. 15-17. \"Whose soever sins ye bind on  earth shall be bound in heaven,\" John xx. 23. One way and degree of  binding is by authoritative, convincing reproof. \"Admonish the unruly,\"  1 Thess. v. 14. \"An heretic, after the first and second admonition,  reject,\" Tit. iii. 1. \"Them that sin, convincingly reprove before all,  that the rest also may fear,\" 1 Tim. v. 20. \"Rebuke them sharply,\" (or  convince them cuttingly,) Tit. iii. 13. \"Sufficient to such an one is  that rebuke, which was from many,\" 2 Cor. ii. 6.    4. Rejecting, and purging out, or putting away from the communion of the  Church, wicked and incorrigible persons, is an ordinance of Christ. \"And  if he will not hear them, tell the Church; but if he will not hear the  Church, let him be unto thee even as a heathen and a publican.\" \"Verily,  I say unto you, what things soever ye shall bind on earth, they shall be  bound in heaven,\" Matt, xviii. 17, 18, compared with Matt. xvi. 19, and  John xx. 21, 23. \"An heretic, after once or twice admonition, reject,\"  Tit. iii. 10; i.e. excommunicate, till he repent--_Pisc. in loc._ By  the lawful judgment of the Church, to deliver the impenitent to  Satan.--_Beza in loc._ \"Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have  delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme,\" 1 Tim. i. 20.  The apostle's scope in 1 Cor. v. is to press the church of Corinth to  excommunicate the incestuous person. \"Ye are puffed up, and have not  rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed may be taken from the  midst of you. For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit,  have already as present judged him that thus wrought this thing. In the  name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my  spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such an one  to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved  in the day of our Lord Jesus,\" 1 Cor. v. 2-5. \"Know ye not that a little  leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven,\"  ver. 7. \"I wrote to you in an epistle, not to be mingled together with  fornicators,\" ver. 9, 11; and explaining what he meant by not being  _mingled together_, saith, \"If any named a brother be a fornicator, or  covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or drunkard, or rapacious, with  such an one not to eat together,\" ver. 11. \"Therefore take away from  among yourselves that wicked person,\" ver. 13.    5. Seasonable remitting, receiving, comforting, and authoritative  confirming again in the communion of the Church those that are penitent.  \"What things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven,\"  Matt. xvi. 19, and xviii. 18. \"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are  remitted unto them,\" John xx. 23. This loosing and remitting is not only  doctrinal and declarative in the preaching of the word, but also  juridical and authoritative in the administration of censures. This is  called, for distinction's sake, absolution. After the church of Corinth  had excommunicated the incestuous person, and he thereupon had given  sufficient testimony of his repentance, the apostle directs them to  receive him into church communion again, saying, \"Sufficient to such an  one is that rebuke inflicted of many; so that contrariwise you should  rather forgive and comfort him, lest such an one should be swallowed up  of abundant sorrow. Wherefore I beseech authoritatively to confirm love  unto him: for to this purpose also I have written unto you, that I may  know the proof of you, if ye be obedient in all things,\" 2 Cor. ii. 6-9.          CHAPTER VIII.    _Of the End and Scope of this Government of the Church._      The end or scope intended by Christ in instituting, and to be aimed at  by Christ's officers in executing of church government in dispensing the  word, sacrament, censures, and all ordinances of Christ, is (as the  description expresseth) _the edifying of the Church of Christ_. This end  is very comprehensive. For the fuller evidencing whereof these two  things are to be proved:1st, That Jesus Christ our Mediator hath under  the New Testament one general visible Church on earth. 2d. That the  edification of this Church of Christ is that eminent scope and end why  Christ gave the power of church government and other ordinances unto the  Church.    I. For the first, that Jesus Christ our Mediator hath under the New  Testament a general visible Church on earth, made up of all particular  churches, may be cleared by considering well these particulars.    1st. That it is evident by the Scriptures that Jesus Christ hath on  earth many particular visible churches: (whether churches  congregational, presbyterial, provincial, or national, needs not here be  determined.) \"Unto the churches of Galatia,\" Gal. i. 2. \"The churches  of Judea,\" Gal. i. 22. \"Through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the  churches,\" Acts xv. 41. \"To the seven churches in Asia,\" Rev. i. 4, 20.  \"The church of Ephesus,\" Rev. ii. 1. \"The church in Smyrna,\" ver. 8.  \"The church in Pergamus,\" ver. 12. \"The church in Thyatira,\" ver. 18.  \"The church in Sardis,\" Rev. iii. 1. \"The church in Philadelphia,\" ver.  7. And \"the church in Laodicea,\" ver. 14. \"The church that is in their  house,\" Rom. xvi. 5; and Philem. 2. \"Let your women keep silence in the  church,\" 1 Cor. xiv. 34. \"All the churches of the Gentiles,\" Rom. xvi.  4. \"So ordain I in all churches,\" 1 Cor. vii. 17. \"As in all churches  of the saints,\" 1 Cor. xiv. 33. \"The care of all the churches,\" 2 Cor.  xi. 28. The New Testament hath many such like expressions.    2d. That how many particular visible churches soever Christ hath on  earth, yet Scripture counts them all to be but one general visible  Church of Christ. This is manifest,    1. By divers Scriptures, using the word church in such a full latitude  and extensive completeness, as properly to signify, not any one single  congregation, or particular church, but one general visible Church: as,  \"Upon this rock I will build my Church,\" Matt. xvi. 18. \"Give none  offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Greeks, nor to the Church of  God,\" 1 Cor. x. 32. \"God hath set some in the Church, first, apostles;  secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers,\" &c., 1 Cor. xii. 28. \"I  persecuted the Church of God,\" 1 Cor. xv. 9; Gal. i. 13. \"The Church of  the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth,\" 1 Tim. iii. 15.  \"Might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God,\" Eph. iii. 10.  \"In the midst of the Church will I sing praise unto thee,\" Heb. ii. 12.  In which, and such like places, we must needs understand, that one  general visible Church of Christ.    2. By such passages of scripture as evidently compare all visible  professors and members of Christ throughout the world to one organical  body, having eyes, ears, hands, feet, &c., viz., several organs,  instruments, officers, &c., in it, for the benefit of the whole body; as,  \"He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and  some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the  work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13944"],[0,"After London; Or, Wild England (#16)"],[1,"thence, resting on the sward, he watched the  vessels making slow progress by oars, and some drawn with ropes by gangs  of men or horses on the shore, through the narrow straits. North and  South there nearly met. There was but a furlong of water between them.  If ever the North came down there the armies would cross. _There_ was  the key of the world. Excepting the few cottages where the owners of the  horses lived, there was neither castle nor town within twenty miles.    Forced on by these thoughts, he broke the long silence which had existed  between him and his father. He spoke of the value and importance of this  spot; could not the Baron send forth his retainers and enclose a new  estate there? There was nothing to prevent him. The forest was free to  all, provided that they rendered due service to the Prince. Might not a  house or castle built there become the beginning of a city? The Baron  listened, and then said he must go and see that a new hatch was put in  the brook to irrigate the water-meadow. That was all.    Felix next wrote an anonymous letter to the Prince pointing out the  value of the place. The Prince should seize it, and add to his power. He  knew that the letter was delivered, but there was no sign. It had  indeed, been read and laughed at. Why make further efforts when they  already had what they desired? One only, the deep and designing  Valentine, gave it serious thought in secret. It seemed to him that  something might come of it, another day, when he was himself in  power--if that should happen. But he, too, forgot it in a week. Some  secret effort was made to discover the writer, for the council were very  jealous of political opinion, but it soon ended. The idea, not being  supported by money or influence, fell into oblivion.    Felix worked on, chipping out the canoe. The days passed, and the boat  was nearly finished. In a day or two now it would be launched, and soon  afterwards he should commence his voyage. He should see Aurora once more  only. He should see her, but he should not say farewell; she would not  know that he was going till he had actually departed. As he thought thus  a dimness came before his eyes; his hand trembled, and he could not  work. He put down the chisel, and paused to steady himself.    Upon the other side of the stream, somewhat lower down, a yellow  wood-dog had been lapping the water to quench its thirst, watching the  man the while. So long as Felix was intent upon his work, the wild  animal had no fear; the moment he looked up, the creature sprang back  into the underwood. A dove was cooing in the forest not far distant, but  as he was about to resume work the cooing ceased. Then a wood-pigeon  rose from the ashes with a loud clapping of wings. Felix listened. His  hunter instinct told him that something was moving there. A rustling of  the bushes followed, and he took his spear which had been leant against  the adjacent tree. But, peering into the wood, in a moment he recognised  Oliver, who, having walked off his rage, was returning.    \"I though it might have been a Bushman,\" said Felix, replacing his  spear; \"only they are noiseless.\"    \"Any of them might have cut me down,\" said Oliver; \"for I forgot my  weapon. It is nearly noon; are you coming home to dinner?\"    \"Yes; I must bring my tools.\"    He put them in the basket, and together they returned to the rope  ladder. As they passed the Pen by the river they caught sight of the  Baron in the adjacent gardens, which were irrigated by his contrivances  from the stream, and went towards him. A retainer held two horses, one  gaily caparisoned, outside the garden; his master was talking with Sir  Constans.    \"It is Lord John,\" said Oliver. They approached slowly under the  fruit-trees, not to intrude. Sir Constans was showing the courtier an  early cherry-tree, whose fruit was already set. The dry hot weather had  caused it to set even earlier than usual. A suit of black velvet, an  extremely expensive and almost unprocurable material, brought the  courtier's pale features into relief. It was only by the very oldest  families that any velvet or satin or similar materials were still  preserved; if these were in pecuniary difficulties they might sell some  part of their store, but such things were not to be got for money in the  ordinary way.    Two small silver bars across his left shoulder showed that he was a  lord-in-waiting. He was a handsome man, with clear-cut features,  somewhat rakish from late hours and dissipation, but not the less  interesting on that account. But his natural advantages were so over-run  with the affectation of the Court that you did not see the man at all,  being absorbed by the studied gesture to display the jewelled ring, and  the peculiarly low tone of voice in which it was the fashion to speak.    Beside the old warrior he looked a mere stripling. The Baron's arm was  bare, his sleeve rolled up; and as he pointed to the tree above, the  muscles, as the limb moved, displayed themselves in knots, at which the  courtier himself could not refrain from glancing. Those mighty arms, had  they clasped him about the waist, could have crushed his bending ribs.  The heaviest blow that he could have struck upon that broad chest would  have produced no more effect than a hollow sound; it would not even have  shaken that powerful frame.    He felt the steel blue eye, bright as the sky of midsummer, glance into  his very mind. The high forehead bare, for the Baron had his hat in his  hand, mocked at him in its humility. The Baron bared his head in honour  of the courtier's office and the Prince who had sent him. The beard,  though streaked with white, spoke little of age; it rather indicated an  abundant, a luxuriant vitality.    Lord John was not at ease. He shifted from foot to foot, and  occasionally puffed a large cigar of Devon tobacco. His errand was  simple enough. Some of the ladies at the Court had a fancy for fruit,  especially strawberries, but there were none in the market, nor to be  obtained from the gardens about the town. It was recollected that Sir  Constans was famous for his gardens, and the Prince despatched Lord John  to Old House with a gracious message and request for a basket of  strawberries. Sir Constans was much pleased; but he regretted that the  hot, dry weather had not permitted the fruit to come to any size or  perfection. Still there were some.    The courtier accompanied him to the gardens, and saw the water-wheel  which, turned by a horse, forced water from the stream into a small pond  or elevated reservoir, from which it irrigated the ground. This supply  of water had brought on the fruit, and Sir Constans was able to gather a  small basket. He then looked round to see what other early product he  could send to the palace. There was no other fruit; the cherries, though  set, were not ripe; but there was some asparagus, which had not yet been  served, said Lord John, at the Prince's table.    Sir Constans set men to hastily collect all that was ready, and while  this was done took the courtier over the gardens. Lord John felt no  interest whatever in such matters, but he could not choose but admire  the extraordinary fertility of the enclosure, and the variety of the  products. There was everything; fruit of all kinds, herbs of every  species, plots specially devoted to those possessing medicinal virtue.  This was only one part of the gardens; the orchards proper were farther  down, and the flowers nearer the house. Sir Constans had sent a man to  the flower-garden, who now returned with two fine bouquets, which were  presented to Lord John: the one for the Princess, the Prince's sister;  the other for any lady to whom he might choose to present it.    The fruit had already been handed to the retainer who had charge of the  horses. Though interested, in spite of himself, Lord John, acknowledging  the flowers, turned to go with a sense of relief. This simplicity of  manners seemed discordant to him. He felt out of place, and in some way  lowered in his own esteem, and yet he despised the rural retirement and  beauty about him.    Felix and Oliver, a few yards distant, were waiting with rising tempers.  The spectacle of the Baron in his native might of physique, humbly  standing, hat in hand, before this Court messenger, discoursing on  cherries, and offering flowers and fruit, filled them with anger and  disgust. The affected gesture and subdued voice of the courtier, on the  other hand, roused an equal contempt.    As Lord John turned, he saw them. He did not quite guess their  relationship, but supposed they were cadets of the house, it being  customary for those in any way connected to serve the head of the  family. He noted the flag basket in Felix's hand, and naturally imagined  that he had been at work.    \"You have been to-to plough, eh?\" he said, intending to be very gracious  and condescending. \"Very healthy employment. The land requires some  rain, does it not? Still I trust it will not rain till I am home, for my  plume's sake,\" tossing his head. \"Allow me,\" and as he passed he offered  Oliver a couple of cigars. \"One each,\" he added; \"the best Devon.\"    Oliver took the cigars mechanically, holding them as if they had been  vipers, at arm's length, till the courtier had left the garden, and the  hedge interposed. Then he threw them into the water-carrier. The best  tobacco, indeed the only real tobacco, came from the warm Devon land,  but little of it reached so far, on account of the distance, the  difficulties of intercourse, the rare occasions on which the merchant  succeeded in escaping the vexatious interference, the downright robbery  of the way. Intercourse was often entirely closed by war.    These cigars, therefore, were worth their weight in silver, and such  tobacco could be obtained only by those about the Court, as a matter of  favour, too, rather than by purchase. Lord John would, indeed, have  stared aghast"]]]
