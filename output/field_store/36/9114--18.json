CUCKOO. _Cuculus canorus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Coucou gris.\"--The  Cuckoo is one of the commonest and most numerous summer visitants to the  Islands, and is generally spread over all of them; it arrives about the  same time that it does in England, that is to say, about the middle of  April. I know earlier instances--even as early as February--have been  recorded, but these must have been recorded in consequence of some  mistake, probably some particularly successful imitation of the note.  Mr. MacCulloch seems to think that the time of their arrival is very  regular, as he writes to me to say, \"The Cuckoo generally arrives here  about the 15th of April; sometimes as early as the 13th, as was the case  this year (1878); the first are generally reported from the cliffs at  St. Martin's, near Moulin Huet, the first land they would make on their  arrival from Brittany.\" Very soon after their arrival, however, they  spread over the whole Island of Guernsey, as well as all the other  neighbouring islands, in all of which they are equally plentiful; they  seem to cross from one to the other without much considering four or  five miles of sea, or being the least particular as to taking the  shortest passage across from island to island. As usual, there were a  great number of Cuckoos in the Vale whilst I was there this summer  (1878); but I was unfortunate in not finding eggs, and in not seeing any  of the foster-parents feeding their over-grown _proteges_: this was  rather surprising, as there were so many Cuckoos about, and many must  have been hatched and out of the nest long before we left at the end of  July. I should think, however, Tree and Meadow Pipits, Skylarks and  Stonechats, from their numbers and the numbers of their nests, must be  the foster-parents most usually selected; other favourites, such as  Wagtails, Hedgesparrows, and Robins, being comparatively scarce in that  part of the Island, and Wheaters, which were numerous, had their nests  too far under large stones to give the Cuckoo an opportunity of  depositing her eggs there. I should have been very glad if I could have  made a good collection of Cuckoos' eggs in the Channel Islands, and,  knowing how common the bird was, I fully expected to do so, but I was  disappointed, and consequently unable to throw any light on the subject  of the variation in the colour of Cuckoos' eggs, as far as the Channel  Islands are concerned, or how far the foster-parents had been selected  with a view to their eggs being similar in colour to those of the  Cuckoo about to be palmed off upon them. The only Cuckoos' eggs I saw  were a few in the Museum, and in one or two other small collections: all  these were very much the same, and what appears to me the usual type of  Cuckoo's egg, a dull greyish ground much spotted with brown, and a few  small black marks much like many eggs of the Tree or Meadow Pipit. It is  hardly the place here to discuss the question how far Cuckoos select the  nest of the birds whose eggs are similar to their own, to deposit their  eggs in, or whether a Cuckoo hatched and reared by one foster-parent  would be likely to select the nest of the same species to deposit its  own eggs in; the whole matter has been very fully discussed in several  publications, both English and German; and Mr. Dresser has given a very  full _resume_ of the various arguments in his 'Birds of Europe'; and  whilst fully admitting the great variation in the colour of the Cuckoos'  eggs, he does not seem to think that any particular care is taken by the  parent Cuckoo to select foster-parents whose eggs are similar in colour  to its own; and the instances cited seem to bear out this opinion, with  which, as far as my small experience goes, I quite agree.    Whilst on the subject of Cuckoos I may mention, for the information of  such of my Guernsey readers who are not ornithologists, and therefore  not well acquainted with the fact, the peculiar state of plumage in  which the female Cuckoo occasionally returns northward in her second  summer; I mean the dull reddish plumage barred with brown, extremely  like that of the female Kestrel: in this plumage she occasionally  returns in her second year and breeds; but when this is changed for the  more general plumage I am unable to state for certain, but probably  after the second autumnal moult. The changes of plumage in the Cuckoo,  however, appear to be rather irregular, as I have one killed in June  nearly in the normal plumage, but with many of the old feathers left,  which have a very Kestrel-like appearance, being redder than the  ordinary plumage of the young bird; some of the tail-feathers, however,  have more the appearance of the ordinary tail-feathers of the young  Cuckoo soon after the tail has reached its full growth: the moult in  this bird must have been very irregular, as it was not completed in  June, when, as a rule, it would have been in full plumage, unless, as  may possibly be the case, this bird was the produce of a second laying  during the southern migration, and consequently, instead of a year, be  only about six months old. This, however, is not a very common state of  plumage; but it is by no means uncommon to find a Cuckoo in May or June  with a good deal of rusty reddish barred with brown, forming a sort of  collar on the breast. I merely mention these rather abnormal changes of  plumage, as they may be interesting to any of my Guernsey readers into  whose hands a Cuckoo may fall in a state of change and prove a puzzle as  to its identity. The Cuckoo departs from the Channel Islands much about  the same time that it does from England on its southern migration in  August or September. Occasionally, however, this southern migration  during the winter seems to be doubted, as a clerical friend of mine once  told me that a brother clergyman, a well educated and even a learned  man, told him, when talking about Cuckoos and what became of them in  winter, that \"it was a mistake to suppose they migrated, but that they  all turned into Sparrow-hawks in the winter.\" As my friend said, could  any one believe this of a well-educated man in the nineteenth century?    The Cuckoo is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There are three specimens, one adult and  two young, in the Museum, as well as some very ordinary eggs.      85. KINGFISHER. _Alcedo ispida_, Linnaeus. French, \"Martin  Pecheur.\"--The Kingfisher is by no means uncommon, is generally spread  over the Islands, and is resident and breeds at all events in Guernsey,  if not in the other Islands also. It is generally to be seen amongst the  wild rocks which surround L'Ancresse Common, where it feeds on the small  fish left in the clear pools formed amongst the rocks by the receding  tide; it is also by no means uncommon amongst the more sheltered bays in  the high rocky part of the Island; it is also to be found about the  small ponds in various gardens. About those in Candie Garden I have  frequently seen Kingfishers, and they breed about the large ponds in the  Vale in Mr. De Putron's grounds; they also occasionally visit the wild  rocky islets to the northward of Herm, even as far as the Amfrocques,  the farthest out of the lot. As well as about the Vale ponds, the  Kingfisher breeds in holes in the rocks all round the Island. I have not  myself seen it in Alderney, but Captain Hubbach writes me word he saw  one there about Christmas, 1862. I think its numbers are slightly  increased in the autumn by migrants, as I have certainly seen more  specimens in Mr. Couch's shop at that time of year than at any other;  this may perhaps, however, be accounted for, at all events partially, by  its being protected by the Sea Bird Act during the summer and in early  autumn, where the 'Martin pecheur' appears as one of the \"Oiseaux de  Mer.\"    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, and only marked as occurring  in Guernsey and Sark. There are three specimens now in the Museum.      86. NIGHTJAR. _Caprimulgus enropaeus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Engoulevent  ordinaire.\"--The Nightjar is a regular autumnal visitant, a few perhaps  arriving in the spring and remaining to breed, but by far the greater  number only making their appearance on their southward migration in the  autumn. The Nightjar occasionally remains very late in the Islands, as  Miss Carey records one in the 'Zoologist' for 1872 as occurring on the  16th of October; and I have one killed as late as the 12th of November:  this bird had its stomach crammed with black beetles, not our common  domestic nuisances, but small winged black beetles: these dates are  later than the Nightjar usually remains in England, though Yarrell  notices one in Devon as late as the 6th of November, and one in Cornwall  on the 27th of November. Colonel Irby, on the faith of Fabier, says the  Nightjars cross the Straits of Gibraltar on their southward journey from  September to November; so these late stayers in Cornwall and Guernsey  have not much time to complete their journey if they intend going as far  south as the coast of Africa; perhaps, however the Guernsey ones have no  such intention, as Mr. Gallienne, in his remarks published with  Professor Ansted's list, says \"The Nightjar breeds here, and I have  obtained it summer and winter.\" Mr. MacCulloch tells me the Goatsucker  is looked upon by the Guernsey people as a bird of ill-omen and a  companion of witches in their aerial rambles. The bird-stuffer in  Alderney had some wings of Nightjars nailed up behind his door which  had been shot in that Island by himself.    Professor Ansted includes the Nightjar in his list, but only marks it as  occurring in Guernsey and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#16)"],[1,"by which I will shew you its weight. I have  here a jar suspended at one end of a balance--it is now equipoised; but  when I pour this carbonic acid into the jar on the one side which now  contains air, you will see it sink down at once, because of the carbonic  acid that I pour into it. And now, if I examine this jar with the lighted  taper, I shall find that the carbonic acid has fallen into it, and it no  longer has any power of supporting the combustion. If I blow a  soap-bubble, which of course will be filled with air, and let it fall into  this jar of carbonic acid, it will float.    [Illustration: Fig. 31.]    But I shall first of all take one of these little balloons filled with  air.  I am not quite sure where the carbonic acid is; we will just try the  depth, and see whereabouts is its level. There, you see, we have this  bladder floating on the carbonic acid; and if I evolve some more of the  carbonic acid, the bladder will be lifted up higher. There it goes--the  jar is nearly full; and now I will see whether I can blow a soap-bubble on  that, and float it in the same way. [The Lecturer here blew a soap-bubble,  and allowed it to fall into the jar of carbonic acid, when it floated in  it midway.] It is floating, as the balloon floated, by virtue of the  greater weight of the carbonic acid than of the air. And now, having so  far given you the history of the carbonic acid--as to its sources in the  candle, as to its physical properties and weight--when we next meet I  shall shew you of what it is composed, and where it gets its elements  from.          LECTURE VI.    CARBON OR CHARCOAL--COAL GAS--RESPIRATION AND ITS ANALOGY TO THE BURNING  OF A CANDLE--CONCLUSION.      A lady, who honours me by her presence at these Lectures, has conferred a  still further obligation by sending me these two candles, which are from  Japan, and, I presume, are made of that substance to which I referred in a  former lecture. You see that they are even far more highly ornamented than  the French candles; and, I suppose, are candles of luxury, judging from  their appearance. They have a remarkable peculiarity about them--namely, a  hollow wick,--that beautiful peculiarity which Argand introduced into the  lamp, and made so valuable. To those who receive such presents from the  East, I may just say that this and such like materials gradually undergo a  change which gives them on the surface a dull and dead appearance; but  they may easily be restored to their original beauty, if the surface be  rubbed with a clean cloth or silk handkerchief, so as to polish the little  rugosity or roughness: this will restore the beauty of the colours. I have  so rubbed one of these candles, and you see the difference between it and  the other which has not been polished, but which may be restored by the  same process. Observe, also, that these moulded candles from Japan are  made more conical than the moulded candles in this part of the world.    I told you, when we last met, a good deal about carbonic acid. We found,  by the lime-water test, that when the vapour from the top of the candle or  lamp was received into bottles, and tested by this solution of lime-water  (the composition of which I explained to you, and which you can make for  yourselves), we had that white opacity which was in fact calcareous  matter, like shells and corals, and many of the rocks and minerals in the  earth. But I have not yet told you fully and clearly the chemical history  of this substance--carbonic acid--as we have it from the candle, and I  must now resume that subject. We have seen the products, and the nature of  them, as they issue from the candle.  We have traced the water to its  elements, and now we have to see where are the elements of the carbonic  acid supplied by the candle. A few experiments will shew this. You  remember that when a candle burns badly, it produces smoke; but if it is  burning well, there is no smoke. And you know that the brightness of the  candle is due to this smoke, which becomes ignited. Here is an experiment  to prove this: so long as the smoke remains in the flame of the candle and  becomes ignited, it gives a beautiful light, and never appears to us in  the form of black particles. I will light some fuel, which is extravagant  in its burning. This will serve our purpose--a little turpentine on a  sponge. You see the smoke rising from it, and floating into the air in  large quantities; and, remember now, the carbonic acid that we have from  the candle is from such smoke as that. To make that evident to you, I will  introduce this turpentine burning on the sponge into a flask where I have  plenty of oxygen, the rich part of the atmosphere, and you now see that  the smoke is all consumed. This is the first part of our experiment; and  now, what follows? The carbon which you saw flying off from the turpentine  flame in the air is now entirely burned in this oxygen, and we shall find  that it will, by this rough and temporary experiment, give us exactly the  same conclusion and result as we had from the combustion of the candle.  The reason why I make the experiment in this manner is solely that I may  cause the steps of our demonstration to be so simple that you can never  for a moment lose the train of reasoning, if you only pay attention. All  the carbon which is burned in oxygen, or air, comes out as carbonic acid,  whilst those particles which are not so burned shew you the second  substance in the carbonic acid--namely, the carbon--that body which made  the flame so bright whilst there was plenty of air, but which was thrown  off in excess when there was not oxygen enough to burn it.    I have also to shew you a little more distinctly the history of carbon and  oxygen, in their union to make carbonic acid. You are now better able to  understand this than before, and I have prepared three or four experiments  by way of illustration. This jar is filled with oxygen, and here is some  carbon which has been placed in a crucible, for the purpose of being made  red-hot. I keep my jar dry, and venture to give you a result imperfect in  some degree, in order that I may make the experiment brighter. I am about  to put the oxygen and the carbon together.  That this is carbon (common  charcoal pulverised), you will see by the way in which it burns in the air  [letting some of the red-hot charcoal fall out of the crucible]. I am now  about to burn it in oxygen gas, and look at the difference. It may appear  to you at a distance as if it were burning with a flame; but it is not so.  Every little piece of charcoal is burning as a spark, and whilst it so  burns it is producing carbonic acid. I specially want these two or three  experiments to point out what I shall dwell upon more distinctly  by-and-by--that carbon burns in this way, and not as a flame.    Instead of taking many particles of carbon to burn, I will take a rather  large piece, which will enable you to see the form and size; and to trace  the effects very decidedly. Here is the jar of oxygen, and here is the  piece of charcoal, to which I have fastened a little piece of wood, which  I can set fire to, and so commence the combustion, which I could not  conveniently do without. You now see the charcoal burning, but not as a  flame (or if there be a flame, it is the smallest possible one, which I  know the cause of--namely, the formation of a little carbonic oxide close  upon the surface of the carbon). It goes on burning, you see, slowly  producing carbonic acid by the union of this carbon or charcoal (they are  equivalent terms) with the oxygen. I have here another piece of charcoal,  a piece of bark, which has the quality of being blown to pieces--exploding  as it burns. By the effect of the heat, we shall reduce the lump of carbon  into particles that will fly off; still every particle, equally with the  whole mass, burns in this peculiar way: it burns as a coal, and not like a  flame. You observe a multitude of little combustions going on, but no  flame. I do not know a finer experiment than this, to shew that carbon  burns with a spark.    Here, then, is carbonic acid formed from its elements. It is produced at  once; and if we examined it by lime-water, you will see that we have the  same substance which I have previously described to you. By putting  together 6 parts of carbon by weight (whether it comes from the flame of a  candle or from powdered charcoal) and 16 parts of oxygen by weight, we  have 22 parts of carbonic acid; and, as we saw last time, the 22 parts of  carbonic acid, combined with 28 parts of lime, produced common carbonate  of lime.  If you were to examine an oyster-shell, and weigh the component  parts, you would find that every 50 parts would give 6 of carbon and 16 of  oxygen, combined with 28 of lime. However, I do not want to trouble you  with these minuti3/4--it is only the general philosophy of the matter that  we can now go into. See how finely the carbon is dissolving away [pointing  to the lump of charcoal burning quietly in the jar of oxygen]. You may say  that the charcoal is actually dissolving in the air round about; and if  that were perfectly pure charcoal, which we can easily prepare, there  would be no residue whatever. When we have a perfectly cleansed and  purified piece of carbon, there is no ash left. The carbon burns as a  solid dense body, that heat alone cannot change as to its solidity, and  yet it passes away into vapour that never condenses into solid or liquid  under ordinary circumstances; and what is more curious still, is the fact  that the oxygen does not change in its bulk by the solution of the carbon  in it. Just as the bulk is at first, so it is at last, only it has become  carbonic acid.    There is another experiment which I must give you before you are fully  acquainted with the general nature of carbonic acid. Being a compound  body, consisting of carbon and oxygen, carbonic acid is a body that we"]]]
