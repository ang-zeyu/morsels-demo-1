[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14451"],[0,"African Camp Fires (#16)"],[1," the sophisticated dweller of the town. Later comes the  identification of the numerous tribes.    The savage comes in just as he has been for, ethnologists alone can  guess, how many thousands of years. He is too old an institution to have  been affected as yet by this tiny spot of modernity in the middle of the  wilderness. As a consequence he startles the newcomer even more than  the sight of giraffes on the sky-line.    When the shenzi--wild man--comes to town he gathers in two or three of  his companions, and presents himself as follows: His hair has been grown  quite long, then gathered in three tight pigtails wound with leather,  one of which hangs over his forehead, and the other two over his ears.  The entire head he has then anointed with a mixture of castor oil and a  bright red colouring earth. This is wiped away evenly all around the  face, about two inches below the hair, to leave a broad, bandlike  glistening effect around the entire head. The ears are most marvellous.  From early youth the lobes have been stretched, until at last they have  become like two long elastic loops, hanging down upon the shoulder, and  capable of accommodating anything up to and including a tomato can. When  in fatigue uniform these loops are caught up over the tops of the ears,  but on dress parade they accommodate almost anything considered  ornamental. I have seen a row of safety pins clasped in them or a number  of curtain rings; or a marmalade jar, or the glittering cover of a  tobacco tin. The edges of the ears, all around to the top, are then  pierced. Then the insertion of a row of long white wooden skewers gives  one a peculiarly porcupinish look; or a row of little brass danglers  hints of wealth. Having thus finished off his head, your savage clasps  around his neck various strings of beads; or collars of iron or copper  wire, polished to the point of glitter; puts on a half-dozen armlets and  leglets of the same; ties on a narrow bead belt, in which is thrust a  short sword; anoints himself all over with reddened castor oil until he  glistens and shines in the sun; rubs his legs with white clay and traces  patterns therein; seizes his long-bladed spear, and is ready for the  city. Oh, no! I forgot--and he probably came near doing so--his strip of  'Mericani.[9] This was originally white, but constant wear over castor  oil has turned it a uniform and beautiful brown.    The purpose of this is ornament, and it is so worn. There has been an  attempt, I understand, to force these innocent children to some sort of  conventional decency while actually in the streets of Nairobi. It was  too large an order. Some bring in clothes, to be sure, because the white  man asks it; but why no sensible man could say. They are hung from one  shoulder, flap merrily in the breeze, and are always quite frankly  tucked up about the neck or under the arms when the wearer happens to be  in haste. As a matter of fact these savages are so beautifully and  smoothly formed; their red-brown or chocolate-brown skin is so fine in  texture, and their complete unconsciousness so genuine that in an hour  the newcomer is quite accustomed to their nakedness.    These proud youths wander mincingly down the street with an expression  of the most fatuous and good-natured satisfaction with themselves. To  their minds they have evidently done every last thing that human  ingenuity or convention could encompass.    These young men are the dandies, the proud young aristocracy of wealth  and importance; and of course they may differ individually or tribally  from the sample I have offered. Also there are many other social grades.  Those who care less for dress or have less to get it with can rub along  very cheaply. The only real essentials are (_a_) something for the  ear--a tomato can will do; (_b_) a trifle for clothing--and for that a  scrap of gunny sacking will be quite enough.    The women to be seen in the streets of Nairobi are mostly of the Kikuyu  tribe. They are pretty much of a pattern. Their heads are shaven,  either completely or to leave only ornamental tufts; and are generally  bound with a fine wire fillet so tightly that the strands seem to sink  into the flesh. A piece of cotton cloth, dyed dark umber red, is belted  around the waist, and sometimes, but not always, another is thrown about  the shoulder. They go in for more hardware than do the men. The entire  arms and the calves of the legs are encased in a sort of armour made of  quarter-inch wire wound closely, and a collar of the same material  stands out like a ruff eight or ten inches around the neck. This is  wound on for good; and must be worn day and night and all the time, a  cumbersome and tremendously heavy burden. A dozen large loops of  coloured beads strung through the ears, and various strings and  necklaces of beads, cowrie shells, and the like finish them out in all  their gorgeousness. They would sink like plummets. Their job in life,  besides lugging all this stuff about, is to carry in firewood and  forage. At any time of the day long files of them can be seen bending  forward under their burdens. These they carry on their backs by means of  a strap across the tops of their heads; after the fashion of the  Canadian tump line.    The next cut above the shenzi, or wild man, is the individual who has  been on safari as carrier, or has otherwise been much employed around  white men. From this experience he has acquired articles of apparel and  points of view. He is given to ragged khaki, or cast-off garments of all  sorts, but never to shoes. This hint of the conventional only serves to  accent the little self-satisfied excursions he makes into barbarism. The  shirt is always worn outside, the ear ornaments are as varied as ever,  the head is shaved in strange patterns, a tiny tight tuft on the crown  is useful as fastening for feathers or little streamers or anything else  that will wave or glitter. One of these individuals wore a red label he  had, with patience and difficulty, removed from one of our trunks. He  had pasted it on his forehead; and it read \"Baggage Room. Not Wanted.\"  These people are, after all, but modified shenzis. The modification is  nearly always in the direction of the comic.    Now we step up to a class that would resent being called shenzis as it  would resent an insult. This is the personal servant class. The members  are of all tribes, with possibly a slight preponderance of Swahilis and  Somalis. They are a very clean, well-groomed, self-respecting class,  with a great deal of dignity, and a great deal of pride in their  bwanas. Also they are exceedingly likely to degenerate unless ruled with  a firm hand and a wise head. Very rarely are they dishonest as respects  the possessions of their own masters. They understand their work  perfectly, and the best of them get the equivalent of from eight to ten  dollars a month. Every white individual has one or more of them; even  the tiny children with their ridiculous little sun helmets are followed  everywhere by a tall, solemn, white-robed black. Their powers of  divination approach the uncanny. About the time you begin to think of  wanting something, and are making a first helpless survey of a boyless  landscape, your own servant suddenly, mysteriously, and unobtrusively  appears from nowhere. Where he keeps himself, where he feeds himself,  where he sleeps you do not know. These beautifully clean, trim,  dignified people are always a pleasant feature in the varied picture.    The Somalis are a clan by themselves. A few of them condescend to  domestic service, but the most prefer the free life of traders, horse  dealers, gunbearers, camel drivers, labour go-betweens, and similar  guerrilla occupations. They are handsome, dashing, proud, treacherous,  courageous, likeable, untrustworthy. They career around on their high,  short-stirruped saddles; they saunter indolently in small groups; they  hang about the hotel hoping for a dicker of some kind. There is nothing  of the savage about them, but much of the true barbarism, with the  barbarian's pride, treachery, and love of colour.    FOOTNOTES:    [8] Native farmlets, generally temporary.

Doubtless an extended stay  in the country would show him that problems of administration and  possibilities of development could be even more absorbing; but such  things are very sketchy to him at first.    As a usual thing, when he wants porters he picks them out from the  throng hanging around the big outfitters' establishments. Each man is  then given a blanket--cotton, but of a most satisfying red--a tin water  bottle, a short stout cord, and a navy blue jersey. After that ceremony  he is yours.    But on the occasion of one three months' journey into comparatively  unknown country we ran up against difficulties. Some two weeks before  our contemplated start two or three cases of bubonic plague had been  discovered in the bazaar, and as a consequence Nairobi was quarantined.  This meant that a rope had been stretched around the infected area, that  the shops had been closed, and that no native could--officially--leave  Nairobi. The latter provision affected us; for under it we should be  unable to get our bearers out.    As a matter of fact, the whole performance--unofficially--was a farce.  Natives conversed affably at arm's length across the ropes; hundreds  sneaked in and out of town at will; and from the rear of the infected  area I personally saw beds, chests, household goods, blankets, and  clothes passed to friends outside the ropes. When this latter condition  was reported, in my presence, to the medical officers, they replied that  this was a matter for police cognizance!

Of course she now, long time so feeble,  To nurse the poor little worm was unable,  And so I reared it all alone,  With milk and water; 'twas my own.  Upon my bosom all day long  It smiled and sprawled and so grew strong.    _Faust_. Ah! thou hast truly known joy's fairest flower.    _Margaret_. But no less truly many a heavy hour.  The wee thing's cradle stood at night  Close to my bed; did the least thing awake her,  My sleep took flight;  'Twas now to nurse her, now in bed to take her,  Then, if she was not still, to rise,  Walk up and down the room, and dance away her cries,  And at the wash-tub stand, when morning streaked the skies;  Then came the marketing and kitchen-tending,  Day in, day out, work never-ending.  One cannot always, sir, good temper keep;  But then it sweetens food and sweetens sleep.       [_They pass on_.]    _Martha_. But the poor women suffer, you must own:  A bachelor is hard of reformation.    _Mephistopheles_. Madam, it rests with such as you, alone,  To help me mend my situation.    _Martha_. Speak plainly, sir, has none your fancy taken?  Has none made out a tender flame to waken?    _Mephistopheles_. The proverb says: A man's own hearth,  And a brave wife, all gold and pearls are worth.    _Martha_. I mean, has ne'er your heart been smitten slightly?    _Mephistopheles_. I have, on every hand, been entertained politely.    _Martha_. Have you not felt, I mean, a serious intention?    _Mephistopheles_.  Jesting with women, that's a thing one ne'er should mention.    _Martha_. Ah, you misunderstand!    _Mephistopheles_. It grieves me that I should!  But this I understand--that you are good.         [_They pass on_.]    _Faust_. So then, my little angel recognized me,  As I came through the garden gate?    _Margaret_. Did not my downcast eyes show you surprised me?    _Faust_. And thou forgav'st that liberty, of late?  That impudence of mine, so daring,  As thou wast home from church repairing?    _Margaret_. I was confused, the like was new to me;  No one could say a word to my dishonor.  Ah, thought I, has he, haply, in thy manner  Seen any boldness--impropriety?  It seemed as if the feeling seized him,  That he might treat this girl just as it pleased him.  Let me confess! I knew not from what cause,  Some flight relentings here began to threaten danger;  I know, right angry with myself I was,  That I could not be angrier with the stranger.    _Faust_. Sweet darling!    _Margaret_. Let me once!      [_She plucks a china-aster and picks off the leaves one after another_.]    _Faust_. What's that for? A bouquet?    _Margaret_. No, just for sport.    _Faust_. How?    _Margaret_. Go! you'll laugh at me; away!       [_She picks and murmurs to herself_.]    _Faust_. What murmurest thou?    _Margaret [half aloud_]. He loves me--loves me not.    _Faust_. Sweet face! from heaven that look was caught!    _Margaret [goes on_]. Loves me--not--loves me--not--       [_picking off the last leaf with tender joy_]  He loves me!    _Faust_. Yes, my child! And be this floral word  An oracle to thee. He loves thee!  Knowest thou all it mean? He loves thee!       [_Clasping both her hands_.]    _Margaret_. What thrill is this!    _Faust_. O, shudder not! This look of mine.  This pressure of the hand shall tell thee  What cannot be expressed:  Give thyself up at once and feel a rapture,  An ecstasy never to end!  Never!--It's end were nothing but blank despair.  No, unending! unending!         [MARGARET _presses his hands, extricates herself, and runs away.        He stands a moment in thought, then follows her_].    _Martha [coming_]. The night falls fast.    _Mephistopheles_. Ay, and we must away.    _Martha_. If it were not for one vexation,  I would insist upon your longer stay.  Nobody seems to have no occupation,  No care nor labor,  Except to play the spy upon his neighbor;  And one becomes town-talk, do whatsoe'er they may.  But where's our pair of doves?    _Mephistopheles_. Flown up the alley yonder.  Light summer-birds!    _Martha_. He seems attached to her.    _Mephistopheles_. No wonder.  And she to him. So goes the world, they say.                A SUMMER-HOUSE.          MARGARET [_darts in, hides behind the door, presses the tip of        her finger to her lips, and peeps through the crack_].    _Margaret_. He comes!          _Enter_ FAUST.    _Faust_. Ah rogue, how sly thou art!  I've caught thee!        [_Kisses her_.]    _Margaret [embracing him and returning the kiss_].  Dear good man! I love thee from my heart!          [MEPHISTOPHELES _knocks_.]    _Faust [stamping_]. Who's there?    _Mephistopheles_. A friend!    _Faust_. A beast!    _Mephistopheles_. Time flies, I don't offend you?    _Martha [entering_]. Yes, sir, 'tis growing late.    _Faust_. May I not now attend you?    _Margaret_. Mother would--Fare thee well!    _Faust_. And must I leave thee then? Farewell!    _Martha_. Ade!    _Margaret_. Till, soon, we meet again!           [_Exeunt_ FAUST _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES.]    _Margaret_. Good heavens! what such a man's one brain  Can in itself alone contain!  I blush my rudeness to confess,  And answer all he says with yes.  Am a poor, ignorant child, don't see  What he can possibly find in me.          [_Exit_.]                WOODS AND CAVERN.    _Faust_ [_alone_].  Spirit sublime, thou gav'st me, gav'st me all  For which I prayed. Thou didst not lift in vain  Thy face upon me in a flame of fire.  Gav'st me majestic nature for a realm,  The power to feel, enjoy her. Not alone  A freezing, formal visit didst thou grant;  Deep down into her breast invitedst me  To look, as if she were a bosom-friend.  The series of animated things  Thou bidst pass by me, teaching me to know  My brothers in the waters, woods, and air.  And when the storm-swept forest creaks and groans,  The giant pine-tree crashes, rending off  The neighboring boughs and limbs, and with deep roar  The thundering mountain echoes to its fall,  To a safe cavern then thou leadest me,  Showst me myself; and my own bosom's deep  Mysterious wonders open on my view.  And when before my sight the moon comes up  With soft effulgence; from the walls of rock,  From the damp thicket, slowly float around  The silvery shadows of a world gone by,  And temper meditation's sterner joy.    O! nothing perfect is vouchsafed to man:  I feel it now! Attendant on this bliss,  Which brings me ever nearer to the Gods,  Thou gav'st me the companion, whom I now  No more can spare, though cold and insolent;  He makes me hate, despise myself, and turns  Thy gifts to nothing with a word--a breath.  He kindles up a wild-fire in my breast,  Of restless longing for that lovely form.  Thus from desire I hurry to enjoyment,  And in enjoyment languish for desire.          _Enter_ MEPHISTOPHELES.    _Mephistopheles_. Will not this life have tired you by and bye?  I wonder it so long delights you?  'Tis well enough for once the thing to try;  Then off to where a new invites you!    _Faust_. Would thou hadst something else to do,  That thus to spoil my joy thou burnest.    _Mephistopheles_. Well! well! I'll leave thee, gladly too!--  Thou dar'st not tell me that in earnest!  'Twere no great loss, a fellow such as you,  So crazy, snappish, and uncivil.  One has, all day, his hands full, and more too;  To worm out from him what he'd have one do,  Or not do, puzzles e'en the very devil.    _Faust_. Now, that I like! That's just the tone!  Wants thanks for boring me till I'm half dead!    _Mephistopheles_. Poor son of earth, if left alone,  What sort of life wouldst thou have led?  How oft, by methods all my own,  I've chased the cobweb fancies from thy head!  And but for me, to parts unknown  Thou from this earth hadst long since fled.  What dost thou here through cave and crevice groping?  Why like a horned owl sit moping?  And why from dripping stone, damp moss, and rotten wood  Here, like a toad, suck in thy food?  Delicious pastime! Ah, I see,  Somewhat of Doctor sticks to thee.    _Faust_. What new life-power it gives me, canst thou guess--  This conversation with the wilderness?  Ay, couldst thou dream how sweet the employment,  Thou wouldst be devil enough to grudge me my enjoyment.    _Mephistopheles_. Ay, joy from super-earthly fountains!  By night and day to lie upon the mountains,  To clasp in ecstasy both earth and heaven,  Swelled to a deity by fancy's leaven,  Pierce, like a nervous thrill, earth's very marrow,  Feel the whole six days' work for thee too narrow,  To enjoy, I know not what, in blest elation,  Then with thy lavish love o'erflow the whole creation.  Below thy sight the mortal cast,  And to the glorious vision give at last--       [_with a gesture_]  I must not say what termination!    _Faust_. Shame on thee!    _Mephistopheles_. This displeases thee; well, surely,  Thou hast a right to say \"for shame\" demurely.  One must not mention that to chaste ears--never,  Which chaste hearts cannot do without, however.  And, in one word, I grudge you not the pleasure  Of lying to yourself in moderate measure;  But 'twill not hold out long, I know;  Already thou art fast recoiling,  And soon, at this rate, wilt be boiling  With madness or despair and woe.  Enough of this! Thy sweetheart sits there lonely,  And all to her is close and drear.  Her thoughts are on thy image only,  She holds thee, past all utterance, dear.  At first thy passion came bounding and rushing  Like a brooklet o'erflowing with melted snow and rain;  Into her heart thou hast poured it gushing:  And now thy brooklet's dry again.  Methinks, thy woodland throne resigning,  'Twould better suit so great a lord  The poor young monkey to reward  For all the love with which she's pining.  She finds the time dismally long;  Stands at the window, sees the clouds on high  Over the old town-wall go by.  \"Were I a little bird!\"[26] so runneth her song  All the "]]]
