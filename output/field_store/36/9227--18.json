So she in her turn  packed up a bundle and started to seek service by the same road. But  when she came to the oven, and the loaves begged her to take them out  because they had been baking seven years and were nigh to burning, she  tossed her head and said:    \"A likely story indeed, that I should burn my fingers to save your  crusts. No, thank you!\"    And with that she went on till she came across the cow standing waiting  to be milked beside the pail. But when the cow said:    \"Little girl! Little girl! Milk me! Please milk me, I've waited seven  years to be milked----\"    She only laughed and replied, \"You may wait another seven years for all  I care. I'm not your dairymaid!\"    And with that she went on till she came to the apple tree, all  overburdened by its fruit. But when it begged her to shake its branches,  she only giggled, and plucking one ripe apple, said:    \"One is enough for me: you can keep the rest yourself.\" And with that  she went on munching the apple, till she came to the witch-woman's  house.    Now the witch-woman, though she had got over being crisp and brown from  the oven, was dreadfully angry with all little maid-servants, and made  up her mind this one should not trick her. So for a long time she never  went out of the house; thus the ill-tempered sister never had a chance  of looking up the chimney, as she had meant to do at once. And she had  to dust, and clean, and brush, and sweep ever so hard, until she was  quite tired out.    But one day, when the witch-woman went into the garden to bury her  bones, she seized the moment, looked up the chimney, and, sure enough, a  bag of gold fell plump into her lap!    Well! she was off with it in a moment, and ran and ran till she came to  the apple tree, when she heard the witch-woman behind her. So she cried  as her sister had done:      \"Apple tree! Apple tree, hide me     So the old witch can't find me,     For if she does she'll break my bones,     Or bury me under the garden stones.\"    But the apple tree said:    \"No room here! I've too many apples.\"    So she had to run on; and when the witch-woman on her broomstick came  flying by and called:      \"O Tree of mine! Tree of mine!     Have you seen a naughty little maid     With a willy willy wag and a great big bag,     Who's stolen my money--all I had?\"    The apple tree replied:      \"Yes, mother dear,     She's gone down there.\"    Then the witch-woman went after her, caught her, gave her a thorough  good beating, took the bag of money away from her, and sent her home  without a penny payment for all her dusting, and sweeping, and brushing,  and cleaning.          [Illustration: Headpiece--The Laidly Worm]    THE LAIDLY WORM      In Bamborough Castle there once lived a King who had two children, a son  named Childe Wynde, and a daughter who was called May Margret. Their  mother, a fair woman, was dead, and the King mourned her long and  faithfully. But, after his son Childe Wynde went to seek his fortune,  the King, hunting in the forest, came across a lady of such great beauty  that he fell in love with her at once and determined to marry her.    Now Princess May Margret was not over-pleased to think that her mother's  place should be taken by a strange woman, nor was she pleased to think  that she would have to give up keeping house for her father the King.  For she had always taken a pride in her work. But she said nothing,  though she stood long on the castle walls looking out across the sea  wishing for her dear brother's return; for, see you, they had mothered  each other.    Still no news came of Childe Wynde; so on the day when the old King was  to bring the new Queen home, May Margret counted over the keys of the  castle chambers, knotted them on a string, and after casting them over  her left shoulder for luck--more for her father's sake than for the new  Queen's regard--she stood at the castle gate ready to hand over the keys  to her stepmother.    Now as the bridal procession approached with all the lords of the north  countrie, and some of the Scots lords in attendance, she looked so fair  and so sweet, that the lords whispered to one another of her beauty. And  when, after saying in a voice like a mavis--      \"Oh welcome, welcome, father,     Unto your halls and towers!     And welcome too, my stepmother,     For all that's here is yours!\"    she turned upon the step and tripped into the yard, the Scots lords said  aloud:      \"Forsooth! May Margret's grace     Surpasses all that we have met, she has so fair a face!\"    Now the new Queen overheard this, and she stamped her foot and her face  flushed with anger as she turned her about and called:      \"You might have excepted me,     But I will bring May Margret to a Laidly Worm's degree;     I'll bring her low as a Laidly Worm     That warps about a stone,     And not till the Childe of Wynde come back     Will the witching be undone.\"    Well! hearing this May Margret laughed, not knowing that her new  stepmother, for all her beauty, was a witch; and the laugh made the  wicked woman still more angry. So that same night she left her royal  bed, and, returning to the lonely cave where she had ever done her  magic, she cast Princess May Margret under a spell with charms three  times three, and passes nine times nine. And this was her spell:      \"I weird ye to a Laidly Worm,     And such sail ye ever be     Until Childe Wynde the King's dear son     Comes home across the sea.     Until the world comes to an end     Unspelled ye'll never be,     Unless Childe Wynde of his own free will     Sail give you kisses three!\"    So it came to pass that Princess May Margret went to her bed a beauteous  maiden, full of grace, and rose next morning a Laidly Worm; for when her  tire-women came to dress her they found coiled up in her bed an awesome  dragon, which uncoiled itself and came towards them. And when they ran  away terrified, the Laidly Worm crawled and crept, and crept and crawled  down to the sea till it reached the rock of the Spindlestone which is  called the Heugh. And there it curled itself round the stone, and lay  basking in the sun.    Then for seven miles east and seven miles west and seven miles north and  south the whole country-side knew the hunger of the Laidly Worm of  Spindlestone Heugh, for it drove the awesome beast to leave its  resting-place at night and devour everything it came across.    At last a wise warlock told the people that if they wished to be quit of  these horrors, they must take every drop of the milk of seven white  milch kine every morn and every eve to the trough of stone at the foot  of the Heugh, for the Laidly Worm to drink. And this they did, and after  that the Laidly Worm troubled the country-side no longer; but lay warped  about the Heugh, looking out to sea with its terrible snout in the air.    But the word of its doings had gone east and had gone west; it had even  gone over the sea and had come to Childe Wynde's ears; and the news of  it angered him; for he thought perchance it had something to do with his  beloved sister May Margret's disappearance. So he called his men-at-arms  together and said:    \"We must sail to Bamborough and land by Spindlestone, so as to quell and  kill this Laidly Worm.\"    Then they built a ship without delay, laying the keel with wood from the  rowan tree. And they made masts of rowan wood also, and oars likewise;  and, so furnished, set forth.    Now the wicked Queen knew by her arts they were coming, so she sent out  her imps to still the winds so that the fluttering sails of silk hung  idle on the masts. But Childe Wynde was not to be bested; so he called  out the oarsmen. Thus it came to pass that one morn the wicked Queen,  looking from the Keep, saw the gallant ship in Bamborough Bay, and she  sent out all her witch-wives and her impets to raise a storm and sink  the ship; but they came back unable to hurt it, for, see you, it was  built of rowan wood, over which witches have no power.    Then, as a last device, the Witch Queen laid spells upon the Laidly Worm  saying:      \"Oh! Laidly Worm! Go make their topmast heel,     Go! Worm the sand, and creep beneath the keel.\"    Now the Laidly Worm had no choice but to obey. So:      \"The Worm leapt up, the Worm leapt down     And plaited round each plank,     And aye as the ship came close to shore     She heeled as if she sank.\"    Three times three did Childe Wynde attempt to land, and three times  three the Laidly Worm kept the good ship from the shore. At last Childe  Wynde gave the word to put the ship about, and the Witch Queen, who was  watching from the Keep, thought he had given up: but he was not to be  bested: for he only rounded the next point to Budley sands. And there,  jumping into the shoal water, he got safely to land, and drawing his  sword of proof, rushed up to fight the awesome Worm. But as he raised  his sword to strike he heard a voice, soft as the western wind:      \"Oh quit thy sword, unbend thy bow,       And give me kisses three,     For though I seem a Laidly Worm       No harm I'll do to thee!\"    And the voice seemed to him like the voice of his dear sister May  Margret. So he stayed his hand. Then once again the Laidly Worm said:      \"Oh quit thy sword, unbend thy bow,       My laidly form forget.     Forgive the wrong and kiss me thrice       For love of May Margret.\"    Then Childe Wynde, remembering how he had loved his sister, put his arms  round the Laidly Worm and kissed it once. And he kissed the loathly  thing twice. And he kissed it yet a third time as he stood with the wet  sand at his feet.    Then with a hiss and a roar the Laidly Worm sank to the sand, and in his  arms was May Margret!    He wrapped her in his mantle, for she trembled in the cold sea air, and  carried her to Bamborough Castle, where the wicked Queen, knowing her  hour was come, stood, all deserted by her imps and witch-wives"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17071"],[0,"Folk-Lore and Legends: Scotland (#16)"],[1,"leaf and lily, and a kirtle of the same fabric,  which, almost touching her white and delicate ankle, showed her snowy  feet, so fairy-light and round that they scarcely seemed to touch the  grass where she stood.  Her hair, a natural ornament which woman seeks  much to improve, was of bright glossy brown, and encumbered rather than  adorned with a snood, set thick with marine productions, among which the  small clear pearl found in the Solway was conspicuous.  Nature had not  trusted to a handsome shape and a sylph-like air for young Barbara's  influence over the heart of man, but had bestowed a pair of large bright  blue eyes, swimming in liquid light, so full of love and gentleness and  joy, that all the sailors from Annanwater to far Saint Bees acknowledged  their power, and sang songs about the bonnie lass of Mark Macmoran.  She  stood holding a small gaff-hook of polished steel in her hand, and seemed  not dissatisfied with the glances I bestowed on her from time to time,  and which I held more than requited by a single glance of those eyes  which retained so many capricious hearts in subjection.    The tide, though rapidly augmenting, had not yet filled the bay at our  feet.  The moon now streamed fairly over the tops of Caerlaverock pines,  and showed the expanse of ocean dimpling and swelling, on which sloops  and shallops came dancing, and displaying at every turn their extent of  white sail against the beam of the moon.  I looked on old Mark the  mariner, who, seated motionless on his grey stone, kept his eye fixed on  the increasing waters with a look of seriousness and sorrow, in which I  saw little of the calculating spirit of a mere fisherman.  Though he  looked on the coming tide, his eyes seemed to dwell particularly on the  black and decayed hulls of two vessels, which, half immersed in the  quicksand, still addressed to every heart a tale of shipwreck and  desolation.  The tide wheeled and foamed around them, and, creeping inch  by inch up the side, at last fairly threw its waters over the top, and a  long and hollow eddy showed the resistance which the liquid element  received.    The moment they were fairly buried in the water, the old man clasped his  hands together, and said: \"Blessed be the tide that will break over and  bury ye for ever!  Sad to mariners, and sorrowful to maids and mothers,  has the time been you have choked up this deep and bonnie bay.  For evil  were you sent, and for evil have you continued.  Every season finds from  you its song of sorrow and wail, its funeral processions, and its  shrouded corses.  Woe to the land where the wood grew that made ye!  Cursed be the axe that hewed ye on the mountains, the hands that joined  ye together, the bay that ye first swam in, and the wind that wafted ye  here!  Seven times have ye put my life in peril, three fair sons have ye  swept from my side, and two bonnie grand-bairns; and now, even now, your  waters foam and flash for my destruction, did I venture my infirm limbs  in quest of food in your deadly bay.  I see by that ripple and that foam,  and hear by the sound and singing of your surge, that ye yearn for  another victim; but it shall not be me nor mine.\"    Even as the old mariner addressed himself to the wrecked ships, a young  man appeared at the southern extremity of the bay, holding his halve-net  in his hand, and hastening into the current.  Mark rose and shouted, and  waved him back from a place which, to a person unacquainted with the  dangers of the bay, real and superstitious, seemed sufficiently perilous;  his granddaughter, too, added her voice to his, and waved her white  hands; but the more they strove, the faster advanced the peasant, till he  stood to his middle in the water, while the tide increased every moment  in depth and strength.  \"Andrew, Andrew,\" cried the young woman, in a  voice quavering with emotion, \"turn, turn, I tell you!  O the Ships, the  Haunted Ships!\"  But the appearance of a fine run of fish had more  influence with the peasant than the voice of bonnie Barbara, and forward  he dashed, net in hand.  In a moment he was borne off his feet, and  mingled like foam with the water, and hurried towards the fatal eddies  which whirled and roared round the sunken ships.  But he was a powerful  young man, and an expert swimmer; he seized on one of the projecting ribs  of the nearest hulk, and clinging to it with the grasp of despair,  uttered yell after yell, sustaining himself against the prodigious rush  of the current.    From a shealing of turf and straw, within the pitch of a bar from the  spot where we stood, came out an old woman bent with age, and leaning on  a crutch.  \"I heard the voice of that lad Andrew Lammie; can the chield  be drowning that he skirls sae uncannily?\" said the old woman, seating  herself on the ground, and looking earnestly at the water.  \"Ou, ay,\" she  continued, \"he's doomed, he's doomed; heart and hand can never save him;  boats, ropes, and man's strength and wit, all vain! vain!--he's doomed,  he's doomed!\"    By this time I had thrown myself into the shallop, followed reluctantly  by Richard Faulder, over whose courage and kindness of heart superstition  had great power, and with one push from the shore, and some exertion in  sculling, we came within a quoitcast of the unfortunate fisherman.  He  stayed not to profit by our aid; for, when he perceived us near, he  uttered a piercing shriek of joy, and bounded towards us through the  agitated element the full length of an oar.  I saw him for a second on  the surface of the water, but the eddying current sucked him down; and  all I ever beheld of him again was his hand held above the flood, and  clutching in agony at some imaginary aid.  I sat gazing in horror on the  vacant sea before us; but a breathing-time before, a human being, full of  youth and strength and hope, was there; his cries were still ringing in  my ears, and echoing in the woods; and now nothing was seen or heard save  the turbulent expanse of water, and the sound of its chafing on the  shores.  We pushed back our shallop, and resumed our station on the cliff  beside the old mariner and his descendant.    \"Wherefore sought ye to peril your own lives fruitlessly,\" said Mark, \"in  attempting to save the doomed?  Whoso touches those infernal ships never  survives to tell the tale.  Woe to the man who is found nigh them at  midnight when the tide has subsided, and they arise in their former  beauty, with forecastle, and deck, and sail, and pennon, and shroud!  Then  is seen the streaming of lights along the water from their cabin windows,  and then is heard the sound of mirth and the clamour of tongues, and the  infernal whoop and halloo and song, ringing far and wide.  Woe to the man  who comes nigh them!\"    To all this my Allanbay companion listened with a breathless attention.  I  felt something touched with a superstition to which I partly believed I  had seen one victim offered up; and I inquired of the old mariner, \"How  and when came these Haunted Ships there?  To me they seem but the  melancholy relics of some unhappy voyagers, and much more likely to warn  people to shun destruction than entice and delude them to it.\"    \"And so,\" said the old man with a smile, which had more of sorrow in it  than of mirth; \"and so, young man, these black and shattered hulks seem  to the eye of the multitude.  But things are not what they seem: that  water, a kind and convenient servant to the wants of man, which seems so  smooth and so dimpling and so gentle, has swallowed up a human soul even  now; and the place which it covers, so fair and so level, is a faithless  quicksand, out of which none escape.  Things are otherwise than they  seem.  Had you lived as long as I have had the sorrow to live; had you  seen the storms, and braved the perils, and endured the distresses which  have befallen me; had you sat gazing out on the dreary ocean at midnight  on a haunted coast; had you seen comrade after comrade, brother after  brother, and son after son, swept away by the merciless ocean from your  very side; had you seen the shapes of friends, doomed to the wave and the  quicksand, appearing to you in the dreams and visions of the night, then  would your mind have been prepared for crediting the maritime legends of  mariners; and the two haunted Danish ships would have had their terrors  for you, as they have for all who sojourn on this coast.    \"Of the time and the cause of their destruction,\" continued the old man,  \"I know nothing certain; they have stood as you have seen them for  uncounted time; and while all other ships wrecked on this unhappy coast  have gone to pieces, and rotted and sunk away in a few years, these two  haunted hulks have neither sunk in the quicksand, nor has a single spar  or board been displaced.  Maritime legend says that two ships of Denmark  having had permission, for a time, to work deeds of darkness and dolor on  the deep, were at last condemned to the whirlpool and the sunken rock,  and were wrecked in this bonnie bay, as a sign to seamen to be gentle and  devout.  The night when they were lost was a harvest evening of uncommon  mildness and beauty: the sun had newly set; the moon came brighter and  brighter out; and the reapers, laying their sickles at the root of the  standing corn, stood on rock and bank, looking at the increasing  magnitude of the waters, for sea and land were visible from Saint Bees to  Barnhourie.  The sails of two vessels were soon seen bent for the  Scottish coast; and, with a speed outrunning the swiftest ship, they  approached the dangerous quicksands and headland of Borranpoint.  On the  deck of the foremost ship not a living soul was seen, or shape, unless  something in darkness and form, resembling a human shadow could be called  a shape, which flitted from extremity to extremity of the ship, with the  appearance of trimming the sails, and directing the vessel's course.  But  the decks of"]]]
