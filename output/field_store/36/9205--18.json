Output growth had  averaged about 7% in recent years, mainly as a result of a boom in  tourism thanks to economic expansion in North America and the UK. The  economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late  1995 due to the effects of Hurricane Luis in September. Agricultural  output had only just begun to recover from a drought in 1994 when Luis  hit. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into developing  the offshore financing sector. A comprehensive package of financial  services legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the medium term,  prospects for the economy will depend on the tourism sector and,  therefore, on continuing income growth in the industrialized nations.

Administration is carried out through consultative member meetings -  the 18th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan in April  1993. Currently, there are 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative  and 16 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven  nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national territory (some  claims overlap) and 19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other  nations that have made no claims have reserved the right to do so. The  US does not recognize the claims of others. The year in parentheses  indicates when an acceding nation was voted to full consultative  (voting) status, while no date indicates the country was an original  1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are - Argentina, Australia,  Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant  consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985),  Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy  (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989),  Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay  (1985), the US, and Russia.

In oasis-like spots will be found plenty of grass where  the soil is nearer the surface and where sub-irrigation keeps the roots  watered. In one of these spots the herd was being held. When the grass  became short they would be moved to another such place.    It required, altogether, fifteen men to take care of the herd, because  many of the cattle had been bought in different places, some in Utah,  and these were always trying to run away and work back toward home, so  they required constant herding. Soon we caught the glimmer of white  canvas, and knew it was the cover of the mess-wagon, so we headed that  way.    The camp was quite near the river so as to be handy to water and to  have the willows for wood. Not a soul was at camp. The fire was out,  and even the ashes had blown away. The mess-box was locked and Mrs.  Louderer's loud calls brought only echoes from the high rock walls  across the river. However, there was nothing to do but to make the best  of it, so we tethered the horses and went down to the river to relieve  ourselves of the dust that seemed determined to unite with the dust  that we were made of. Mrs. Louderer declared she was \"so mat as nodings  and would fire dot Herman so soon as she could see him alreaty.\"    Presently we saw the most grotesque figure approaching camp. It was  Herman, the fat cook, on Hunks, a gaunt, ugly old horse, whose days of  usefulness under the saddle were past and who had degenerated into a  workhorse. The disgrace of it seemed to be driving him into a decline,  but he stumbled along bravely under his heavy load. A string of a dozen  sage chickens swung on one side, and across the saddle in front of  Herman lay a young antelope. A volley of German abuse was hurled at  poor Herman, wound up in as plain American as Mrs. Louderer could  speak: \"And who iss going to pay de game warden de fine of dot antelope  what you haf shot? And how iss it that we haf come de camp by und so  starved as we iss hungry, and no cook und no food? Iss dat for why you  iss paid?\"    Herman was some Dutch himself, however. \"How iss it,\" he demanded, \"dat  you haf not so much sense as you haf tongue? How haf you lived so long  as always in de West und don't know enough to hunt a bean-hole when you  reach your own camp. Hey?\"    Mrs. Louderer was very properly subdued and I delighted when he removed  the stones from where the fire had been, exposing a pit from which,  with a pair of pot-hooks, he lifted pots and ovens of the most  delicious meat, beans, and potatoes. From the mess-box he brought bread  and apricot pie. From a near-by spring he brought us a bright, new pail  full of clear, sparkling water, but Mrs. Louderer insisted upon tea and  in a short time he had it ready for us. The tarpaulin was spread on the  ground for us to eat from, and soon we were showing an astonished cook  just how much food two women and a child could get away with. I ate a  good deal of ashes with my roast beef and we all ate more or less sand,  but fastidiousness about food is a good thing to get rid of when you  come West to camp.    When the regular supper-time arrived the punchers began to gather in,  and the \"boss,\" who had been to town about some business, came in and  brought back the news of the man-hunt. The punchers sat about the  fire, eating hungrily from their tin plates and eagerly listening to  the recital. Two of the boys were tenderfeet: one from Tennessee called  \"Daisy Belle,\" because he whistled that tune so much and because he had  nose-bleed so much,--couldn't even ride a broncho but his nose would  bleed for hours afterwards; and the other, \"N'Yawk,\" so called from his  native State. N'Yawk was a great boaster; said he wasn't afraid of no  durned outlaw,--said his father had waded in bloody gore up to his neck  and that he was a chip off the old block,--rather hoped the chase would  come our way so he could try his marksmanship.    The air began to grow chill and the sky was becoming overcast.  Preparations for the night busied everybody. Fresh ponies were being  saddled for the night relief, the hard-ridden, tired ones that had been  used that day being turned loose to graze. Some poles were set up and a  tarpaulin arranged for Mrs. Louderer and me to sleep under. Mrs.  Louderer and Jerrine lay down on some blankets and I unrolled some  more, which I was glad to notice were clean, for Baby and myself. I  can't remember ever being more tired and sleepy, but I couldn't go to  sleep. I could hear the boss giving orders in quick, decisive tones. I  could hear the punchers discussing the raid, finally each of them  telling exploits of his favorite heroes of outlawry. I could hear  Herman, busy among his pots and pans. Then he mounted the tongue of the  mess-wagon and called out, \"We haf for breakfast cackle-berries, first  vot iss come iss served, und those vot iss sleep late gets nodings.\"    I had never before heard of cackle-berries and asked sleepy Mrs.  Louderer what they were. \"Vait until morning and you shall see,\" was  all the information that I received.    Soon a gentle, drizzling rain began, and the punchers hurriedly made  their beds, as they did so twitting N'Yawk about making his between  our tent and the fire. \"You're dead right, pard,\" I heard one of them  say, \"to make your bed there, fer if them outlaws comes this way  they'll think you air one of the women and they won't shoot you. Just  us _men_ air in danger.\"    \"Confound your fool tongues, how they goin' to know there's any women  here? I tell you, fellers, my old man waded in bloody gore up to his  neck and I'm just like him.\"    They kept up this friendly parleying until I dozed off to sleep, but I  couldn't stay asleep. I don't think I was afraid, but I certainly was  nervous. The river was making a sad, moaning sound; the rain fell  gently, like tears. All nature seemed to be mourning about something,  happened or going to happen. Down by the river an owl hooted dismally.  Half a mile away the night-herders were riding round and round the  herd. One of them was singing,--faint but distinct came his song: \"Bury  me not on the lone prairie.\" Over and over again he sang it. After a  short interval of silence he began again. This time it was, \"I'm  thinking of my dear old mother, ten thousand miles away.\"    Two punchers stirred uneasily and began talking. \"Blast that Tex,\" I  heard one of them say, \"he certainly has it bad to-night. What the  deuce makes him sing so much? I feel like bawling like a kid; I wish  he'd shut up.\" \"He's homesick; I guess we all are too, but they ain't  no use staying awake and letting it soak in. Shake the water off the  tarp, you air lettin' water catch on your side an' it's running into my  ear.\"    That is the last I heard for a long time. I must have slept. I remember  that the baby stirred and I spoke to him. It seemed to me that  something struck against the guy-rope that held our tarpaulin taut, but  I wasn't sure. I was in that dozy state, half asleep, when nothing is  quite clear. It seemed as though I had been listening to the tramp of  feet for hours and that a whole army must be filing past, when I was  brought suddenly into keen consciousness by a loud voice demanding,  \"Hello! Whose outfit is this?\" \"This is the 7 Up,--Louderer's,\" the  boss called back; \"what's wanted?\" \"Is that you, Mat? This is Ward's  posse. We been after Meeks and Murdock all night. It's so durned dark  we can't see, but we got to keep going; their horses are about played.  We changed at Hadley's, but we ain't had a bite to eat and we got to  search your camp.\" \"Sure thing,\" the boss answered, \"roll off and take  a look. Hi, there, you Herm, get out of there and fix these fellers  something to eat.\"    We were surrounded. I could hear the clanking of spurs and the sound of  the wet, tired horses shaking themselves and rattling the saddles on  every side. \"Who's in the wickiup?\" I heard the sheriff ask. \"Some  women and kids,--Mrs. Louderer and a friend.\"    In an incredibly short time Herman had a fire coaxed into a blaze and  Mat Watson and the sheriff went from bed to bed with a lantern. They  searched the mess-wagon, even, although Herman had been sleeping there.  The sheriff unceremoniously flung out the wood and kindling the cook  had stored there. He threw back the flap of our tent and flashed the  lantern about. He could see plainly enough that there were but the four  of us, but I wondered how they saw outside where the rain made it  worse, the lantern was so dirty. \"Yes,\" I heard the sheriff say, \"we've  been pushing them hard. They're headed north, evidently intend to hit  the railroad but they'll never make it. Every ford on the river is  guarded except right along here, and there's five parties ranging on  the other side. My party's split,--a bunch has gone on to the bridge.  If they find anything they're to fire a volley. Same with us. I knew  they couldn't cross the river nowhere but at the bridge or here.\"    The men had gathered about the fire and were gulping hot coffee and  cold beef and bread. The rain ran off their slickers in little  rivulets. I was sorry the fire was not better, because some of the men  had on only ordinary coats, and the drizzling rain seemed determined  that the fire should not blaze high.    Before they had finished eating we heard a shot, followed by a regular  medley of dull booms. The men were in their saddles and gone in less  time than it takes to tell it. The firing had ceased save for a few  sharp reports from the revolvers, like a coyote's spiteful snapping.  The pounding of the horse's hoofs grew fainter, and soon all was still.  I kept my ears strained for the slightest sound. The cook and the boss,  the only men up, hurried back to bed. Watson had risen so hurriedly  that he had not been careful about his \"tarp\" and water had run into  his bed. But that wouldn't disconcert"]]]
