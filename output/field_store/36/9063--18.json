[1] Found by Loftus in 1854: their early date was not recognized at  the time.  [2] Koldewey, _Excavations at Babylon, E.T._, p. 261, fig. 182.  Koldewey curiously speaks of the saw-blades as 'palaeolithic.' They  are, of course, nothing of the sort.    Characteristics: flint, chert, obsidian, green and red jasper, and  quartz-crystal flakes, arrowheads, cores, and saw-blades. Chert and  limestone rough hoe-blades (easily mistaken for palaeolithic  implements; they are, however, much flatter); polished serpentine or  jasper celts; lentoid (lentil-shaped), amygdaloid (almond-shaped),  and discoid beads of cornelian, crystal, obsidian, &c., unpolished;  nails of translucent quartz and obsidian (obviously imitations of  metal types); hard grey pottery sickles, pottery cones of various  sizes, and pottery objects like gigantic nails bent up at the ends;  pottery painted with designs in black, usually geometrical (see  illustration XIV, Fig. 1), but sometimes showing plant-forms or even  animals. This ware is often very fine, so much so as to look as if  wheelmade. The shapes are chiefly bowls (often closely resembling  early Egyptian stone bowl types), pots with suspension-handles or  lugs, and spouted 'kettles'. All these objects are at Shahrein and  el-'Obeid found lying on the desert surface at the distance of 50 or  100 yards from the tell; they are supposed to have been washed out of  the lower strata of the latter by rains. Objects of this kind should  be recorded from any site, and the neighbourhood of a desert tell  should always be searched for them.      [ILLUSTRATION XIV MESOPOTAMIAN POTTERY, SEALS, ETC].    [ILLUSTRATION XV: CUNEIFORM AND OTHER SCRIPTS].      II. EARLY BRONZE (Copper) AGE: First Sumerian (pre-Sargonic) Period;  c. 3500-3000 B.C. Earliest Sumerian civilization.    Typical sites. Older strata at Telloh (LAGASH); Fara (SHURUPPAK);  Tell 'Obeid (ancient name as yet unknown); Shahrein (ERIDU).     Characteristics. Writing. First appearance of script, already  conventionalized from pictographs. Cut on stone and incised on clay  tablets and bricks of characteristic early style. Brick buildings,  with crenellated walls (until the discovery of Tell 'Obeid supposed  to date only from the later Sumerian period) of typical plano-convex  bricks, baked or crude, usually with thumb-mark down length of  convex side (Shahrein), or with two thumb-holes (for carrying the  brick when wet?), or vent-holes ('Obeid); at first uninscribed, later  with long inscriptions; measuring 10 x 6 x 2-2 1/4 ins. (Shahrein),  and 8 x 6 x 2-2 1/4 ins. ('Obeid); poorly shaped and baked (see XIV,  Fig. 3). Bitumen used for mortar; laid very thick. Hard white stucco  on internal faces of crude brick house walls, often decorated with  red, white, and black painted horizontal stripes (Shahrein.)  Pottery. Wheel and hand-made; drab, fine or coarse paste, unpainted  and usually undecorated. Typical shapes: (see XIV, Figs. 2 abc)  mostly handleless vases, and cups, and spouted 'kettles' (again often  resembling early Egyptian types).    Metals: Copper. Extensive use: large copper figures of animals,  heads cast, bodies of copper plates fastened by nails over a core of  clay with a mixture of bitumen and straw; the figures have eyes,  tongues, and teeth of red and white stone and nacre (Tell 'Obeid);  goat's head with inlaid eyes of nacre (Fara). Otherwise ordinary  treatment of eye shows a number of wrinkle lines round it, and it is  always disproportionately large (bull's heads, Tell 'Obeid and  Telloh). Small fragments of copper or bronze on the surface of a tell  should never be neglected, as there may be enough in any fragment to  give an idea of possible archaic remains within the tell.    Silver. Rare. Fine engraved vase of Entemena (Telloh, _Louvre_).    Gold. Not uncommon. Copper nails with gold-plated heads (Shahrein).    Stone. Portrait figures in round (Bismaya, Telloh, &c.), usually  representing men, with face and head shaven; very prominent large  curved nose; usually squatting with arms crossed, sometimes standing;  only garment a kilt apparently made of locks of natural wool. Usually  inscribed in archaic characters on back of shoulders. Material: a  grey or a white limestone most usual; tufa and dolerite also used.  Reliefs: large stelae (Stele of the Vultures; Telloh, _Louvre_,  fragment in _B. M._), completely inscribed; small relief plaques,  inscribed (Telloh, _Louvre_). Flint carved and engraved cylinder-  seals, of limestone, black basalt, jasper, diorite, &c. Vases, bowls,  and cups (usually fragmentary), of white and pink limestone and  breccia. Maceheads of breccia, granite, &c., of same type as the  early Egyptian (Shahrein).    Shell. Very largely used for decoration; small plaques of nacre  often engraved with scenes of men worshipping, &c. (Telloh);  tessellated pillars with nacre plaques ('Obeid). Seal-cylinders of  shell.    Wood. Rarely survives; small beams plated with copper ('Obeid).    Burials. Pottery coffins with lids, mat burials; bodies contracted;  funerary furniture, copper, stone or pottery drinking cups held near  mouth: copper weapons, fish-hooks, net weights; beads of agate,  lapis, shell (unpolished); colour-dishes, (Fara). (The idea that the  Babylonians ever burnt their dead is now discredited; the supposed  'fire-necropoles' at Zurghul, &c., are not substantiated.)    The burials are hard to distinguish from similar contracted  interments of later date, except that the furniture is more abundant  in early times and mat graves are unusual in later days Mounds of  this age may be known by the occurrence on the surface of scraps of  oxydized copper, nails, &c.; shell-fragments; undecorated light drab  sherds; and the typical small plano-convex bricks.      III. MIDDLE BRONZE AGE.  1. Early Semitic or Akkadian (Sargonid) period; c. 3000-2500 B.C.    Characteristics. Less crude style of art: development of writing (see  XIV, Fig. 1); first inscribed clay tablets of usual style; beginnings  of cuneiform, developed from the archaic semi-pictographic character.  Bricks still plano-convex; stamped inscriptions begin. Stone  maceheads of same type as earlier. Large and well-cut cylinder-seals  of fine limestone, lapis, diorite, granite, and shell are  characteristic of the period: they are generally of an easily  recognizable form (reel-shaped) with sides showing a marked concavity  (see XIV, Fig. 5). The great development of art is shown by the stele  of Naram-Sin (_Louvre_) found at Susa. Not many mounds of this period  have been dug.    2. Later Sumerian (Gudea) and early Semitic Babylonian (Hammurabi)  periods; c. 2500-1800 B.C.    Characteristics. Typical 'Gudea' style of sculpture, in round and  relief (Telloh, _Louvre_); materials hard diorite, dolerite and  basalt as well as limestone: characteristic treatment of eye with  heavily marked brows: elaborate tiaras and head-dresses of female  figures, &c. Very high development. Regular use of cuneiform on clay  tablets and cones (see XV, Figs. 13-15); non-cuneiform character (in  a developed form) still used in brick stamps (XV, Fig. 10) and on  stone monuments. Bricks (XIV, Fig. 4) now rectangular and well made,  either square (14 ins., usually, by 2 1/2 ins. thick) or oblong (11  1/2 x 8 x 2 1/2 ins., or 10 x 5 x 2 1/2 ins.) with stamps or incised  inscriptions of Ur-Engur, Dungi, Bur-Sin, Gudea and other kings (XV,  Fig. 10), from Ur, Shahrein, Telloh, Niffer, &c. Bricks of Bur-Sin  from Shahrein often have inscription-stamps also on the smaller sides  (thickness). Great buildings of crude and baked brick (Telloh, Ur);  temple-towers (ziggurats) of crude brick faced with burnt brick (Ur,  Shahrein, Niffer). Town ruins of Hammurabi's age (Babylon): crude  brick: plans always confused and haphazard. Bitumen still used for  mortar. Burials, contracted, often in double pots (mouth to mouth),  sealed with bitumen. With the bodies are found large numbers of agate  and cornelian beads, unpolished.    Mounds of this period may be recognized by the typical square or  oblong bricks (often with thumb-holes), with stamps of kings' names,  &c., in non-cuneiform characters, or with hand-incised inscriptions  in early cuneiform, made while the clay was wet; clay tablets or  cones inscribed in early cuneiform; copper nails (those with gold-  plated heads found at Shahrein may also date from this time); drab or  black pottery sherds with impressed or incised designs, generally  rough and evidently made with a piece of stick or the thumb-nail;  rough stone quern-slabs with rubbers, grinding and hammer-stones,  &c.; and the burials described above (these, however, also occur in  later times).      IV. LATER BRONZE AGE:  Kassite, Middle Babylonian, and Early Assyrian periods; c. 1800-  1000 B.C.    Characteristics. Stabilization of Babylonian art; typical 'Kassite'  cylinder-seals with straight sides (XIV, Fig. 6); disappearance of  old non-cuneiform character with gradual disuse of Sumerian; early  stone-cut inscriptions in cuneiform (see XV, Fig. 16; an Elamite  inscription). Occasional and rare appearance of glazed pottery  (imitation of Egyptian), and multi-coloured glass; early Assyrian  sculpture (those unversed in minutiae of Mesopotamian art will only  be able to tell this earlier work from the later by the earlier style  of the accompanying inscriptions). Not many mounds of this period  have been dug.      V. EARLY IRON AGE:  1. Late Babylonian and Assyrian periods; c. 1000-540 B.C.    Characteristics. Flourishing period of Assyrian art and writing (for  details see the archaeological books, which are very full on this  period). Mounds may be known by the occurrence of fragments of  granite or basalt bowl-querns, often with feet; pieces or whole vases  of the multi-coloured opaque glass usually called 'Phoenician' (which  are already found in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13579"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#16)"],[1,"nearly gone, can only distinguish light and dark.

Submitted January 24, 1938  Indianapolis, Indiana          Submitted by:  William Webb Tuttle  District No. 2  Muncie, Indiana    NEGRO SLAVES IN DELAWARE COUNTY  MRS. BETTY GUWN  MRS. HATTIE CASH, DAUGHTER, residing at 1101 East Second Street  Muncie, Indiana      Mrs. Betty Guwn was born March 25, 1832, as a slave on a tobacco  plantation, near Canton, Kentucky. It was a large plantation whose  second largest product was corn. She was married while quite young by  the slave method which was a form of union customary between the white  masters. If the contracting parties were of different plantations the  masters of the two estates bargained and the one sold his rights to the  one on whose plantation they would live. Her master bought her husband,  brought him and set them up a shack. Betty was the personal attendant of  the Mistress. The home was a large Colonial mansion and her duties were  many and responsible. However, when her house duties were caught up her  mistress sent her immediately to the fields. Discipline was quite stern  there and she was \"lined up\" with the others on several occasions.    Her cabin home began to fill up with children, fifteen in all. The  ventilation was ample and the husband would shoot a prowling dog from  any of the four sides of the room without opening the door. The cracks  between the logs would be used by cats who could step in anywhere. The  slaves had \"meetin'\" some nights and her mistress would call her and  have her turn a tub against her mansion door to keep out the sound.    Her master was very wealthy. He owned and managed a cotton farm of two  thousand acres down in Mississippi, not far from New Orleans. Once a  year he spent three months there gathering and marketing his cotton.  When he got ready to go there he would call all his slaves about him and  give them a chance to volunteer. They had heard awful tales of the slave  auction block at New Orleans, and the Master would solemnly promise  them that they should not be sold if they went down of their own accord.  \"My Mistress called me to her and privately told me that when I was  asked that question I should say to him: \"I will go\". The Master had to  take much money with him and was afraid of robbers. The day they were to  start my Mistress took me into a private room and had me remove most of  my clothing; she then opened a strong box and took out a great roll of  money in bills; these she strapped to me in tight bundles, arranging  them around my waist in the circle of my body. She put plenty of  dresses over this belt and when she was through I wore a bustle of money  clear around my belt. I made a funny \"figger\" but no one noticed my odd  shape because I was a slave and no one expected a slave to \"know  better\". We always got through safely and I went down with my Mistress  every year. Of course my husband stayed at home to see after the family,  and took them to the fields when too young to work under the task  master, or over-seer. Three months was a long time to be separated.\"    \"When the Civil War came on there was great excitement among we slaves.  We were watched sharply, especially soldier timber for either army. My  husband ran away early and helped Grant to take Fort Donaldson. He said  he would free himself, which he did; but when we were finally set free  all our family prepared to leave. The Master begged us to stay and  offered us five pounds of meal and two pounds of pork jowl each week if  we would stay and work. We all went to Burgard, Kentucky, to live. At  that time I was about 34 years old. My husband has been dead a long time  and I live with my children. If the \"Good Lord\" spares me until next  March the 25th, I will be 106 years old. I walk all about lively without  crutches and eye-glasses and I have never been sick until this year when  a tooth gave me trouble; but I had it pulled.\"          Archie Koritz, Field Worker  Federal Writers' Project  Porter County--District #1  Valparaiso, Indiana    EX-SLAVES  MRS. HOCKADAY  2581 Madison Street  Gary, Indiana      Mrs. Hockaday is the daughter of an ex-slave and like so many others  does not care to discuss the dark side of slavery and the cruel  treatment that some of them received.    After the Civil War the slaves who for the most part were unskilled and  ignorant, found it very difficult to adjust themselves to their new life  as free persons. Formerly, they lived on the land of their masters and  although compelled to work long hours, their food and lodging were  provided for them. After their emancipation, this life was changed. They  were free and had to think for themselves and make a living. Times for  the negro then was much the same as during the depression. Several of  the slaves started out to secure jobs, but all found it difficult to  adjust themselves to the new life and difficult to secure employment.  Many came back to their old owners and many were afraid to leave and  continued on much as before.    The north set up stores or relief stations where the negro who was  unable to secure employment could obtain food and shelter. Mrs. Hockaday  says it was the same as conditions have been the last few years.    About all the negro was skilled at was servant work and when they came  north, they encountered the same difficulties as several of the colored  folks who, driven by the terrible living conditions in the south four  years ago, came to Gary. Arriving here they believed they were capable  of servant work. However they were not accustomed to modern appliances  and found it very difficult to adjust themselves. It was the same after  the Emancipation.    Many owners were kind and religious and had schools for their slaves,  where they could learn to read and write. These slaves were more  successful in securing employment.    Although the negro loved the Bible most of all books, and were mostly  Methodists and Baptists, their different religious beliefs is caused by  the slave owners having churches for the slaves. Whatever church the  master belonged to, the slaves belonged to, and continued in the same  church after the war.    Since slaves took the name of their owners, children in the same family  would have different names. Mr. Hockaday's father and his brothers and  sisters all had different names. On the plantation they were called  \"Jones' Jim,\" \"Brown's Jones,\" etc. Many on being freed left their old  homes and adopted any name that they took a fancy to. One slave that  Mrs. Hockaday remembers took the name of Green Johnson and says he often  remarked that he surely was green to adopt such a name. His grandson in  Gary is an exact double for Clark Gable, except he is brown, and Gable  is white.    Many slave owners gave their slaves small tracts of land which they  could tend after working hours. Anything raised belonged to them and  they could even sell the products and the money was theirs. Many slaves  were able to save enough from these tracts to purchase their freedom  long before the Emancipation.    Another condition that confronted the negro in the north was that they  were not understood like they were by the southern people. In the south  they were trusted and considered trustworthy by their owners. Even  during the Civil War, they were trusted with the family jewels, silver,  etc., when the northern army came marching by, whereas in the north,  even though they freed the slaves, they would not trust them. For that  reason, many of the slaves did not like the northern people and remained  or returned to the southern plantations.    The slave owners thought that slavery was right and nothing was wrong  about selling and buying human beings if they were colored, much as a  person would purchase a horse or automobile today. The owners who  whipped their slaves usually stripped them to the waist and lashed them  with a long leather whip, commonly called a blacksnake.    Mrs. Hockaday is a large, pleasant, middle-aged woman and does not like  to discuss the cruel side of slavery and only recalls in a general way  what she had heard old slaves discuss.          Federal Writers' Project  of the W.P.A.  District #6  Marion County  Anna Pritchett  1200 Kentucky Avenue    FOLKLORE  ROBERT HOWARD--EX-SLAVE  1840 Boulevard Place      Robert Howard, an ex-slave, was born in 1852, in Clara County, Kentucky.    His master, Chelton Howard, was very kind to him.    The mother, with her five children, lived on the Howard farm in peace  and harmony.    His father, Beverly Howard, was owned by Bill Anderson, who kept a  saloon on the river front.    Beverly was \"hired out\" in the house of Bill Anderson. He was allowed to  go to the Howard farm every Saturday night to visit with his wife and  children. This visit was always looked forward to with great joy, as  they were devoted to the father.    The Howard family was sold only once, being owned first by Dr. Page in  Henry County, Kentucky. The family was not separated; the entire family  was bought and kept together until slavery was abolished.      Interviewer's Comment    Mr. Howard seems to be a very kind old man, lives in the house for aged  colored people (The Alpha Home).    He has no relatives, except a brother. He seems well satisfied living in  the home.    Submitted January 10, 1938  Indianapolis, Indiana          Grace Monroe  Dist. 4  Jefferson County    SLAVE STORY  MR.
