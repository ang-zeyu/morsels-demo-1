He replied that he  did not know, but he had a friend in London who knew all these sort of  things, so the Turkish ambassador in London brought the spoon to  Professor Owen. He observed something in the divergences of the fibres  of the horn which he knew before, and went off into the Museum of the  College of Surgeons, and brought a preserved specimen of this very bird.  \"God is great--God is great,\" said the Turk, \"this is the Phoenix of  which we have heard so often.\" I heard the Professor tell this at a  dinner of the London Hunterian Society in 1857.    There is no great chief in Manyuema or Balegga; all are petty headmen,  each of whom considers himself a chief: it is the ethnic state, with no  cohesion between the different portions of the tribe. Murder cannot be  punished except by a war, in which many fall, and the feud is made  worse, and transmitted to their descendants.    The heathen philosophers were content with mere guesses at the future  of the soul. The elder prophets were content with the Divine support in  life and in death. The later prophets advance further, as Isaiah: \"Thy  dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake,  and sing, ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs.  The earth also shall cast out her dead.\" This, taken with the sublime  spectacle of Hades in the fourteenth chapter, seems a forecast of the  future, but Jesus instructed Mary and her sister and Lazarus; and Martha  without hesitation spoke of the resurrection at the last day as a  familiar doctrine, far in advance of the Mosaic law in which she had  been reared.    The Arabs tell me that Monyungo, a chief, was sent for five years among  the Watuta to learn their language and ways, and he sent his two sons  and a daughter to Zanzibar to school. He kills many of his people, and  says they are so bad that if not killed they would murder strangers.  Once they were unruly, when he ordered some of them to give their huts  to Mohamad; on refusing, he put fire to them, and they soon called out,  \"Let them alone; we will retire.\" He dresses like an Arab, and has ten  loaded guns at his sitting-place, four pistols, two swords, several  spears, and two bundles of the Batuta spears: he laments that his father  filed his teeth when he was young. The name of his very numerous people  is Bawungu, country Urungu: his other names are Ironga, Mohamu.    The Basango, on the other hand, consider their chief as a deity, and  fear to say aught wrong, lest he should hear them: they fear both before  him and when out of sight.    The father of Merere never drank pombe or beer, and assigned as a reason  that a great man who had charge of people's lives should never become  intoxicated so as to do evil. Bange he never smoked, but in council  smelled at a bunch of it, in order to make his people believe that it  had a great effect on him. Merere drinks pombe freely, but never uses  bange: he alone kills sheep; he is a lover of mutton and beef, but  neither goats nor fowls are touched by him.    _9th November, 1870._--I sent to Lohombo for dura, and planted some  Nyumbo. I long excessively to be away and finish my work by the two  Lacustrine rivers, Lualaba of Webb and Young, but wait only for Syde and  Dugumbe, who may have letters, and as I do not intend to return hither,  but go through Karagwe homewards, I should miss them altogether. I groan  and am in bitterness at the delay, but thus it is: I pray for help to do  what is right, but sorely am I perplexed, and grieved and mourn: I  cannot give up making a complete work of the exploration.    _10th November, 1870._--A party of Katomba's men arrived on their way to  Ujiji for carriers, they report that a foray was made S.W. of Mamohela  to recover four guns, which were captured from Katomba; three were  recovered, and ten of the Arab party slain. The people of Manyuema  fought very fiercely with arrows, and not till many were killed and  others mutilated would they give up the guns; they probably expected  this foray, and intended to fight till the last. They had not gone in  search of ivory while this was enacting, consequently Mohamad's men have  got the start of them completely, by going along Lualaba to Kasongo's,  and then along the western verge of the Metamba or forest to Loinde or  Rindi River. The last men sent took to fighting instead of trading, and  returned empty; the experience gained thus, and at the south-west, will  probably lead them to conclude that the Manyuema are not to be shot down  without reasonable cause. They have sown rice and maize at Mamohela, but  cannot trade now where they got so much ivory before. Five men were  killed at Rindi or Loinde, and one escaped: the reason of this outbreak  by men who have been so peaceable is not divulged, but anyone seeing the  wholesale plunder to which the houses and gardens were subject can  easily guess the rest. Mamohela's camp had several times been set on  fire at night by the tribes which suffered assault, but did not effect  all that was intended. The Arabs say that the Manyuema now understand  that every gunshot does not kill; the next thing they will learn will  be to grapple in close quarters in the forest, where their spears will  outmatch the guns in the hands of slaves, it will follow, too, that no  one will be able to pass through this country; this is the usual course  of Suaheli trading; it is murder and plunder, and each slave as he rises  in his owner's favour is eager to show himself a mighty man of valour,  by cold-blooded killing of his countrymen: if they can kill a  fellow-nigger, their pride boils up. The conscience is not enlightened  enough to cause uneasiness, and Islam gives less than the light of  nature.    I am grievously tired of living here. Mohamad is as kind as he can be,  but to sit idle or give up before I finish my work are both intolerable;  I cannot bear either, yet I am forced to remain by want of people.    _11th November, 1870._--I wrote to Mohamad bin Saleh at Ujiji for  letters and medicines to be sent in a box of China tea, which is half  empty: if he cannot get carriers for the long box itself, then he is to  send these, the articles of which I stand in greatest need.    The relatives of a boy captured at Monanyembe brought three goats to  redeem him: he is sick and emaciated; one goat was rejected. The boy  shed tears when he saw his grandmother, and the father too, when his  goat was rejected. \"So I returned, and considered all the oppressions  that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were  oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their  oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.\"--Eccles. iv. 1.  The relations were told either to bring the goat, or let the boy die;  this was hard-hearted. At Mamohela ten goats are demanded for a captive,  and given too; here three are demanded. \"He that is higher than the  highest regardeth, and there be higher than they. Marvel not at the  matter.\"    I did not write to the coast, for I suspect that the Lewale Syde bin  Salem Buraschid destroys my letters in order to quash the affair of  robbery by his man Saloom, he kept the other thief, Kamaels, by him for  the same purpose. Mohamad writes to Bin Saleh to say that I am here and  well; that I sent a large packet of letters in June 1869, with money,  and received neither an answer, nor my box from Unyanyembe, and this is  to be communicated to the Consul by a friend at Zanzibar. If I wrote, it  would only be to be burned; this is as far as I can see at present: the  friend who will communicate with the Consul is Mohamad bin Abdullah the  Wuzeer, Seyd Suleiman is the Lewale of the Governor of Zanzibar,  Suleiman bin Ali or _Sheikh_ Suleiman the Secretary.    The Mamohela horde is becoming terrified, for every party going to trade  has lost three or four men, and in the last foray they saw that the  Manyuema can fight, for they killed ten men: they will soon refuse to go  among those whom they have forced to become enemies.    One of the Bazula invited a man to go with him to buy ivory; he went  with him, and on getting into the Zulas country the stranger was asked  by the guide if his gun killed men, and how it did it: whilst he was  explaining the matter he was stabbed to death. No one knows the reason  of this, but the man probably lost some of his relations elsewhere: this  is called murder without cause. When Syde and Dugumbe come, I hope to  get men and a canoe to finish my work among those who have not been  abused by Ujijians, and still retain their natural kindness of  disposition; none of the people are ferocious without cause; and the  sore experience which they gain from slaves with guns in their hands  usually ends in sullen hatred of all strangers.    The education of the world is a terrible one, and it has come down with  relentless rigour on Africa from the most remote times! What the African  will become after this awfully hard lesson is learned, is among the  future developments of Providence. When He, who is higher than the  highest, accomplishes His purposes, this will be a wonderful country,  and again something like what it was of old, when Zerah and Tirhaka  flourished, and were great.    The soil of Manyuema is clayey and remarkably fertile, the maize sown in  it rushes up to seed, and everything is in rank profusion if only it be  kept clear of weeds, but the Bambarre people are indifferent  cultivators, planting maize, bananas and plantains, and ground-nuts  only--no dura, a little cassava, no pennisetum, meleza, pumpkins,  melons, or nyumbo, though they all flourish in other districts: a few  sweet potatoes appear, but elsewhere all these native grains and roots  are abundant and cheap. No one would choose this as a residence, except  for the sake of Moenekuss. Oil is very dear, while at Lualaba a gallon  may be got for a single string of beads, and beans,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1703"],[0,"Dead Men Tell No Tales (#16)"],[1,"ation,  and alarm: to think that her life was in my hands, and that it depended,  not on that prompt action which was the one course I had contemplated,  but on twenty-four hours of resolute inactivity! I would not think it.  I refused the condition. It took away my one prop, my one stay, that  prospect of immediate measures which alone preserved in me such coolness  as I had retained until now. I was cool no longer; where I had relied  on practical direction I was baffled and hindered and driven mad; on my  honor believe I was little less for some moments, groaning, cursing,  and beating the air with impotent fists--in one of them my poor love's  letter crushed already to a ball.    Danger and difficulty I had been prepared to face; but the task that I  was set was a hundred-fold harder than any that had whirled through my  teeming brain. To sit still; to do nothing; to pretend I knew nothing;  an hour of it would destroy my reason--and I was invited to wait  twenty-four!    No; my word was passed; keep it I must. She knew the men, she must know  best; and her life depended on my obedience: she made that so plain.  Obey I must and would; to make a start, I tottered over the plank that  spanned the beck, and soon I saw the cottage against the moonlit sky.  I came up to it. I drew back in sudden fear. It was alight upstairs and  down, and the gaunt strong figure of the woman Braithwaite stood out  as I had seen it first, in the doorway, with the light showing warmly  through her rank red hair.    \"Is that you, Mr. Cole?\" she cried in a tone that she reserved for me;  yet through the forced amiability there rang a note of genuine surprise.  She had been prepared for me never to return at all!    My knees gave under me as I forced myself to advance; but my wits took  new life from the crisis, and in a flash I saw how to turn my weakness  into account. I made a false step on my way to the door; when I reached  it I leant heavily against the jam, and I said with a slur that I felt  unwell. I had certainly been flushed with wine when I left Rattray; it  would be no bad thing for him to hear that I had arrived quite tipsy at  the cottage; should he discover I had been near an hour on the way, here  was my explanation cut and dried.    So I shammed a degree of intoxication with apparent success, and Jane  Braithwaite gave me her arm up the stairs. My God, how strong it was,  and how weak was mine!    Left to myself, I reeled about my bedroom, pretending to undress; then  out with my candles, and into bed in all my clothes, until the cottage  should be quiet. Yes, I must lie still and feign sleep, with every nerve  and fibre leaping within me, lest the she-devil below should suspect  me of suspicions! It was with her I had to cope for the next  four-and-twenty hours; and she filled me with a greater present terror  than all those villains at the hall; for had not their poor little  helpless captive described her as \"about the worst of the gang?\"    To think that my love lay helpless there in the hands of those wretches;  and to think that her lover lay helpless here in the supervision of this  vile virago!    It must have been one or two in the morning when I stole to my  sitting-room window, opened it, and sat down to think steadily, with the  counterpane about my shoulders.    The moon sailed high and almost full above the clouds; these were  dispersing as the night wore on, and such as remained were of a  beautiful soft tint between white and gray. The sky was too light for  stars, and beneath it the open country stretched so clear and far that  it was as though one looked out at noonday through slate-colored glass.  Down the dewy slope below my window a few calves fed with toothless  mouthings; the beck was very audible, the oak-trees less so; but for  these peaceful sounds the stillness and the solitude were equally  intense.    I may have sat there like a mouse for half an hour. The reason was that  I had become mercifully engrossed in one of the subsidiary problems:  whether it would be better to drop from the window or to trust to the  creaking stairs. Would the creaking be much worse than the thud, and  the difference worth the risk of a sprained ankle? Well worth it, I at  length decided; the risk was nothing; my window was scarce a dozen feet  from the ground. How easily it could be done, how quickly, how safely in  this deep, stillness and bright moonlight! I would fall so lightly on  my stocking soles; a single soft, dull thud; then away under the moon  without fear or risk of a false step; away over the stone walls to the  main road, and so to the nearest police-station with my tale; and before  sunrise the villains would be taken in their beds, and my darling would  be safe!    I sprang up softly. Why not do it now? Was I bound to keep my rash,  blind promise? Was it possible these murderers would murder her?  I struck a match on my trousers, I lit a candle, I read her letter  carefully again, and again it maddened and distracted me. I struck my  hands together. I paced the room wildly. Caution deserted me, and I made  noise enough to wake the very mute; lost to every consideration but that  of the terrifying day before me, the day of silence and of inactivity,  that I must live through with an unsuspecting face, a cool head, a civil  tongue! The prospect appalled me as nothing else could or did; nay, the  sudden noise upon the stairs, the knock at my door, and the sense that  I had betrayed myself already even now all was over--these came as a  relief after the haunting terror which they interrupted.    I flung the door open, and there stood Mrs. Braithwaite, as fully  dressed as myself.    \"You'll not be very well sir?\"    \"No, I'm not.\"    \"What's t' matter wi' you?\"    This second question was rude and fierce with suspicion: the real woman  rang out in it, yet its effect on me was astonishing: once again was I  inspired to turn my slip into a move.    \"Matter?\" I cried. \"Can't you see what's the matter; couldn't you see  when I came in? Drink's the matter! I came in drunk, and now I'm mad. I  can't stand it; I'm not in a fit state. Do you know nothng of me? Have  they told you nothing? I'm the only man that was saved from the Lady  Jermyn, the ship that was burned to the water's edge with every soul but  me. My nerves are in little ends. I came down here for peace and quiet  and sleep. Do you know that I have hardly slept for two months? And now  I shall never sleep again! O my God I shall die for want of it! The wine  has done it. I never should have touched a drop. I can't stand it; I  can't sleep after it; I shall kill myself if I get no sleep. Do you  hear, you woman? I shall kill myself in your house if I don't get to  sleep!\"    I saw her shrink, virago as she was. I waved my arms, I shrieked in  her face. It was not all acting. Heaven knows how true it was about the  sleep. I was slowly dying of insomnia. I was a nervous wreck. She must  have heard it. Now she saw it for herself.    No; it was by no means all acting. Intending only to lie, I found  myself telling little but the strictest truth, and longing for sleep as  passionately as though I had nothing to keep me awake. And yet, while my  heart cried aloud in spite of me, and my nerves relieved themselves in  this unpremeditated ebullition, I was all the time watching its effect  as closely as though no word of it had been sincere.    Mrs. Braithwaite seemed frightened; not at all pitiful; and as I calmed  down she recovered her courage and became insolent. I had spoilt her  night. She had not been told she was to take in a raving lunatic. She  would speak to Squire Rattray in the morning.    \"Morning?\" I yelled after her as she went. \"Send your husband to the  nearest chemist as soon as it's dawn; send him for chloral, chloroform,  morphia, anything they've got and as much of it as they'll let him have.  I'll give you five pounds if you get me what'll send me to sleep all  to-morrow--and to-morrow night!\"    Never, I feel sure, were truth and falsehood more craftily interwoven;  yet I had thought of none of it until the woman was at my door, while of  much I had not thought at all. It had rushed from my heart and from my  lips. And no sooner was I alone than I burst into hysterical tears, only  to stop and compliment myself because they sounded genuine--as though  they were not! Towards morning I took to my bed in a burning fever, and  lay there, now congratulating myself upon it, because when night came  they would all think me so secure; and now weeping because the night  might find me dying or dead. So I tossed, with her note clasped in my  hand underneath the sheets; and beneath my very body that stout weapon  that I had bought in town. I might not have to use it, but I was  fatalist enough to fancy that I should. In the meantime it helped me to  lie still, my thoughts fixed on the night, and the day made easy for me  after all.    If only I could sleep!    About nine o'clock Jane Braithwaite paid me a surly visit; in half an  hour she was back with tea and toast and an altered mien. She not only  lit my fire, but treated me the while to her original tone of almost  fervent civility and respect and determination. Her vagaries soon ceased  to puzzle me: the psychology of Jane Braithwaite was not recondite. In  the night it had dawned upon her that Rattray had found me harmless and  was done with me, therefore there was no need for her to put herself out  any further on my account. In the morning, finding me really ill, she  had gone to the hall in alarm; her subsequent attentions were an act of  obedience; and in their midst came Rattray himself to my bedside.          CHAPTER XIII. THE LONGEST DAY OF MY LIFE      The boy looked so blithe and buoyant, so gallant and still so frank,  that even now I could not think as meanly of him as poor Eva did.
