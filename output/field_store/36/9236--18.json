The living may be baptized for the dead, so  that those who have left this world may receive the gospel in the spirit  world and have the birth of the water done for them vicariously by  someone in the flesh.\"    \"This is strange doctrine.\"    \"Temples are used for these baptisms. The Latter-day Saints are busy  tracing back as far as possible their lines of ancestry, and then they  are going into their temples--for they have already four of them--and  are doing this work for their dead. In this way is being fulfilled  Malachi's prediction that Elijah the Prophet should come before the  great and dreadful day of the Lord, 'and He shall turn the heart of the  fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their  fathers,' lest the Lord come and smite the earth with a curse. You will  find this in the last chapter of the Old Testament.\"    The lamp burned late into the night as these two men sat by it talking;  and the conversation was not, as one of them had planned, for the most  part about the land of America and its material opportunities.          XII.      \"Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he    cannot be my disciple.\"--_Luke 14:33._      \"I cannot understand him,\" Frue Bogstad was saying. \"His actions are so  strange.\"    \"It's simply wicked of him,\" added Froken Selma Bogstad. \"He is bringing  the whole family into disrepute.\"    The mother did not reply, but turned her face thoughtfully away from the  angry daughter.    \"The boy is completely carried away with this American religion,\"  continued the girl, pacing nervously back and forth in the room. \"Pastor  Tonset called to see him the other day, and you ought to have heard  them! The pastor, as our friend, came to advise him; but do you think  Henrik would take any advice? Why, he even argued with the pastor,  saying that he could prove the truth of this religion from the  Scriptures.\"    \"Has he talked to you about it?\"    \"Yes; and he wanted me to accompany him to Osterhausgaden where these  people hold meetings. I told him definitely and forcibly that I didn't  want him to mention religion to me.\"    \"He seems to be in such deep earnest.\"    \"And that's the pity of it. It does no good to talk to him. He takes it  for granted that he should be persecuted. I believe he is ready to give  up everything for this creed that has him in its grasp.\"    A violent ringing of the bell brought Selma to the door. It was Henrik,  who had forgotten his latch key. He hung up his hat, wiped the  perspiration from his face, for it was a warm evening; then he said  cheerily:    \"Spring is coming; I feel it in the air. I'll be glad to get out to  Nordal--there is so much to do this summer--\"    \"Young man,\" interrupted the sister, \"we have been talking about you.\"    \"About my wickedness, I suppose.\"    \"About your foolishness. It isn't very pleasant for us--what you're  doing.\"    \"What am I doing? That which is unkind to you, mother?\" He placed his  arms lovingly around her shoulders, but she sat without replying, her  face in her handkerchief. He turned to Selma.    \"What have I done?\" he asked. \"Do I drink? Do I gamble? Do I steal? Do I  lie? Do I profane? Do I treat any of you unkindly? Am I disrespectful to  my mother or my sister?\"    \"You associate with a people known everywhere as the scum of the earth,\"  snapped the sister, as she stood in front of him. \"You are disgracing  us--the whole Bogstad family--you--but what's the use of talking to  you.\"    \"Not a bit of use that way, dear sister. Suppose you answer some of my  questions. You accuse, but never bring proof. You would rather believe  uninformed people than me. You accept hearsay, but will not listen to  the truth I wish to tell you. I have asked you to point out some of the  bad things taught by the Latter-day Saints, but so far you have never  tried. I have invited you to go with me--\"    \"Do you think I would thus disgrace myself to appear in their meetings!\"    \"You will not even read a simple tract; you close your eyes and ears.  You push God from you when you say that He does not reveal Himself any  more; and so does Pastor Tonset and all his followers. Because I am  willing to receive light, even though it comes from a 'sect everywhere  spoken against,' I am a bad man. I tell you, my sister, and also you, my  mother, I may be looked upon as a disgrace to the Bogstad family, but  the time will come when you and all that family will thank the Lord that  one member of the family heard the truth, and had courage enough to  accept it!\"    Selma walked to the door, and now passed out without replying. Henrik  sat down by his mother, and the two continued to converse in low, quiet  tones.    The mother's hair was white, the face pinched from much suffering, the  hands shrunken. Selma's talk disturbed her, as did that of a score or  more of interested relatives; but when she talked with Henrik alone she  was at peace, and she listened quietly to what he told her. She was so  old and weak and traditionated in the belief of her fathers that she  could grasp but feebly the principles taught her by Henrik; but this she  knew, that there was something in his tone and manner of speech that  soothed her and drove away the resentment and hardness of heart left by  the talk of others.    \"You know, mother,\" Henrik was saying, \"this restored gospel answers so  many of life's perplexing questions. It is broad, full of common sense,  and mercy. Father, as you well know, was not a religious man. When he  died, Pastor Tonset gave it as his opinion that father was a lost  soul--\"    \"Father was a good man.\"    \"I know he was, mother; and to say that because he could not believe in  the many inconsistencies taught as religious truths, he is everlastingly  lost, doesn't appeal to me--never did. Father, as all of us, will  continue to learn in the spirit world to which all must go; and when the  time comes, he will, no doubt, see the truths of the gospel and accept  them. And here is where the beauty of true religion comes in: it teaches  that there is hope beyond the grave; that salvation is not limited to  this life; that every soul will have a chance, either here or hereafter.  You, mother, have worried over father's condition. Don't do it any more;  he will be all right.\" He felt like adding that she had more reason to  worry over the living, but he said no more.    Selma came in with the coffee, and no further discourse was had on  religious topics. Although Henrik had quit using coffee with his meals,  he occasionally sipped a little in the company of his mother. This  evening he took the proffered cup from his sister, who soon withdrew  again, and then Henrik and his mother continued their talk. It was along  the lines of the old faith, grounded into them and their forefathers  since Christianity had been \"reformed\" in their country. As a boy,  Henrik had not been religious, as that term was understood by his  people, but nevertheless he had in him a strain of true devotion which  the message of the American missionary had aroused. However, this  revival within the young man did not meet with the favor of his friends,  and he was looked upon as having come under the influence of some evil,  heretical power, much to their regret.    \"Marie is here,\" announced Selma from the door.    Henrik arose. \"Where is she? I did not know she was in town.\"    \"She is in the east room.\"    \"Tell her to come in.\"    \"She says she wants to see you alone.\"    \"All right. Good night then, mother. Pleasant dreams to you.\"    Henrik found Marie sitting by the open window looking over the tops of  the shrubbery in the garden. The light from the setting sun bathed her  in its glow, increasing the beauty of an already beautiful face. Henrik  stepped up behind the girl and placed his hands under her chin. She did  not turn her head.    \"This is a surprise,\" he said, \"but I am _so_ glad to see you. Did you  have a pleasant time at Skarpen?\"    There was no reply. The young woman still surveyed the garden and the  darkening shadows on the lawn.    \"What is the matter, little girl?\" he asked. He felt the trembling of  her chin as she removed his hands.    \"No,\" she replied, \"I did not have a good time.\"    \"I'm sorry. What was wrong?\"    \"You were not there--you were somewhere else, where your heart is more  than with me--you were, no doubt at Osterhausgade.\" She hardened her  tone as she proceeded.    \"Oh, I'm not there all the time,\" he laughed.    \"You think more of the people you meet there than you do of me, at any  rate.\"    \"What makes you think so?\"    \"You, and your actions. O, Henrik, could you but hear the talk--I hear  it, and people look so strangely at me, and pity me ... I can't stand  it!\" She arose as if to escape him, walked across the room, then sat  down by the center table. He closed the window blind, then lighted the  gas, and seated himself opposite her by the table. There was a pause  which she at last broke by saying:    \"I hear that you are actually going to join those horrid people--is that  true?\"    There was another long silence as they looked at each other across the  table.    \"Yes,\" he said.    \"Next week?\"    \"That was my intention--yes.\"    \"And we were to be married next month?\"    \"Yes--\"    \"Well, I want to tell you, Henrik, that if you join those people the  wedding day will have to be postponed.\"    \"For how long?\"    \"For a long, long time.\"    \"Well--I had thought to be baptized next week; but, of course, I can  postpone it.\"    \"For good, Henrik--say for good.\"    \"No; I can't say that; for a little while--to please you, to let you  think a little longer on the matter. I want you to choose deliberately,  Marie. There need be no undue haste. I don't want you to make up your  mind unalterably to reject me because of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17253"],[0,"Dewey and Other Naval Commanders (#16)"],[1,"month of January, 1815, in company with the  _Peacock_ and _Tom Bowline_, but the three became separated, each making  for Tristan d'Acunha, which had been named as the rendezvous of the  squadron under the command of Stephen Decatur.    This was on the last day of February, and Captain Biddle was about to  drop anchor when a sail appeared, and the _Hornet_ went out to  reconnoitre. The stranger approached as if anxious to fight him, and,  when within musket range, ran up the English flag and fired a shot, to  which the _Hornet_ replied with a broadside. The vessels continued  firing as they drew near each other. The superior aim of the American  speedily crippled the rigging of the other, and, coming together, the  _Penguin_, as the British vessel proved to be, in preparing to board,  succeeded in passing her bowsprit between the main and mizzen rigging of  the _Hornet_ on the starboard quarter. This gave the enemy the  opportunity he seemed to be seeking, but his boarders did not appear.    The American sailors begged permission of Captain Biddle to board, but  he would not consent, since he wished to hold the advantage already  gained. Just then the heaving sea broke the vessels apart, the _Penguin_  receiving considerable damage from the forcible rupture. The _Hornet_  wore round to bring her broadside to bear, and was on the point of  opening fire, when the surviving officer of the _Penguin_ called out  that they surrendered. His condition was so hopeless that no choice was  left to him.    Captain Biddle ordered his men to stop firing, and, stepping to the  taffrail, asked his enemy if they had struck. The answer was two musket  shots, one aimed at the man at the wheel and the other at Biddle. The  latter was hit on the chin and badly, though not dangerously, wounded,  while the man at the wheel was not struck. The men who fired the  treacherous shots were seen by two American marines, who shot them dead.    No doubt the action of the Englishmen was unauthorized, and probably was  due to a misunderstanding; but the Americans were so incensed that it  was difficult to restrain them from continuing the firing. The enemy  hailed a second time and called out they had surrendered.    The strength of the _Hornet_ was 20 guns and 132 men; of the _Penguin_,  19 guns and 128 men. The _Hornet_ had 1 man killed and 11 wounded; the  _Penguin_, 10 killed and 28 wounded. She was so badly shattered that,  after taking out her stores, her captors scuttled her.    In order to complete our history of the gallant Captain James Biddle it  is necessary to carry the record in advance of some of the incidents  that follow.    As has been stated, the _Peacock_ and the _Hornet_ had gone to Tristan  d'Acunha in obedience to the orders of Commodore Decatur, to wait for  him and the _President_, but the latter never arrived, for the good  reason that she had been captured by the enemy. Growing tired of  waiting, Biddle and Captain Warrington, of the _Peacock_, started on an  extended cruise, April 13, for the East Indies.    Doubling the Cape of Good Hope, they met with no incident of note until  the latter part of April, when they sighted a large sail, which they  believed to be a heavily laden East India merchantman. A chase  immediately began. It continued a long time, and the _Peacock_ was  within a few miles, when she made the discovery that the stranger,  instead of being a merchantman, was a ship of the line. Captain  Warrington signalled the startling fact to Biddle, and the two turned to  escape. Since the formidable vessel could not pursue both when they  took different directions, she selected the _Hornet_ for her prize.    All that Biddle could now hope to do was to out-sail his pursuer. He put  forth every effort known to the most skilful seamanship. When night  closed in, however, the pursuer had perceptibly gained. Since the  weather was perfectly clear and the two were in plain sight of each  other, the enemy could keep up the chase all night. Captain Biddle threw  overboard some of his heavy spars, cut away the sheet anchor and flung  several tons of kentledge into the sea.    This helped matters somewhat, but the stranger continued slowly to gain,  and secured such a position that Captain Biddle was obliged to go about.  Still he could not shake off the bulldog at his heels, and at daylight  he was near enough to begin barking with the bow guns. Although the shot  did not strike the _Hornet_, Captain Biddle dropped his remaining  anchors into the sea, including six guns, launch, cables, and everything  not absolutely necessary.    The lightening was so considerable that for the first time the _Hornet_  began drawing away from her persistent pursuer. At the end of a few  hours, however, he began creeping up again, and Captain Biddle tumbled  overboard all his guns except one, most of his shot, his extra spars,  cutlasses, muskets, forge and bell, and indeed everything of which he  could free himself. Not only that, but the men lay down on the quarter  deck to help trim the ship.    All in vain. The shot and shell whistled about the _Hornet_, the enemy  came closer, and every American prepared to submit as gracefully as  possible to the inevitable. Captain Biddle addressed his men feelingly,  telling them to show the same restraint in misfortune that they had in  victory, and then the gallant officer coolly awaited the moment when he  should be obliged to haul down his flag to save the lives of his brave  crew.    But lo! the wind changed to a quarter favorable to the _Hornet_, and it  lasted throughout the night and the next day. The _Hornet_ drew steadily  away from the British ship of the line _Cornwallis_, as she proved to  be, and made her way at a leisurely speed to the United States.          CHAPTER XIII.    Captains Carden and Decatur--Cruise of the _Macedonian_--Battle with the  Frigate _United States_--Decatur's Chivalry.      Before the war broke out between England and the United States the naval  officers naturally were on the best of terms with one another. They  exchanged visits, had dinners together and talked in the most friendly  terms over the relations of their respective countries. Brave men always  feel thus, and no matter how fiercely they have been fighting, they  become friends again as soon as peace is declared.    You have already been told considerable about Stephen Decatur, one of  the bravest and most chivalrous men that ever drew a sword. At the  breaking out of the War of 1812 he was given command of the frigate  _United States_, of 44 guns, built in 1798, and one of the finest in the  American navy. While lying at Norfolk, some months before war was  declared, the British frigate _Macedonian_, of about the same strength,  was in port, and the officers and crews became well acquainted.    The commander of the _Macedonian_ was Captain John Surman Carden, one of  the finest officers in the British service. He and Decatur became fond  of each other and often discussed the probable results of the impending  naval contests, for it was apparent to both that their countries were on  the brink of war. Captain Carden conceded the bravery and skill of the  American officers and seamen, but insisted that they would be at a  disadvantage, because they had not met with the experience of the  Englishmen, who had been engaged in so many wars with European nations.    The _Macedonian_ was made of oak and was without a superior in the  British navy. In the latter part of September, 1812, she left  Portsmouth, England. She was just off the docks and her crew, 297 in  number, were such as the best officer would have been proud to command.  The discipline was as near perfection as possible, Captain Carden being  one of the severest of disciplinarians. His business was to look out for  French merchantmen and warships, though as it was known that war had  been declared with the United States, it was deemed probable that  Captain Carden would have a chance of testing the mettle of her naval  officers and crews.    There were two American vessels that Captain Carden was specially  anxious to meet. One was the _Essex_, which was playing havoc among the  English shipping (and of which I shall tell you something later on),  and the other that of Captain Stephen Decatur, the courteous but brave  naval officer who had displayed so much intrepidity in the war with  Tripoli and had insisted to Carden that the American sailors were the  match of the English anywhere.    While at Madeira Captain Carden learned that the _Essex_ had sailed from  the Delaware and was expected to cruise in the neighborhood of the  Canary Islands. The Englishman turned southward and was within a few  days' sail of the islands when, on the 25th of October, the man at the  masthead reported a sail. As it approached it was carefully scrutinized  and found to be a frigate bearing down on the _Macedonian_.    Convinced that she was an enemy, Captain Carden at once issued the  command to clear for action. The most thorough preparations were made  and officers were stationed with orders to shoot down the first man who  flinched from his duty. On board the ship were a number of American  seamen, who began speculating among themselves as to whether the  approaching frigate was a Frenchman or belonged to their own country.  They were in a trying position, for they were patriotic and would have  given anything in the world to escape firing upon their countrymen, but  there was no help for it. Such a rigid disciplinarian as Captain Carden  would listen to no protests from them, and, should the stranger prove  to be an American, it would be a choice between helping to fight her or  being shot down by their own officers.    The approaching frigate went through a number of evolutions of such a  rapid and brilliant nature that the Englishmen murmured their  admiration. Through their glasses the officers could see groups of men  on the quarter deck"]]]
