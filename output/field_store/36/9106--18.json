And if we are  singing to gain a better use of voice we must, in every sound we make,  have our thoughts exactly upon what we are doing. This is  Concentration. If, on the other hand, we are trying our skill on a  song, we shall have, in addition, to be careful to give the right  expression, to sing not only the tones clearly, but the words, to feel  the true sentiment both of the poem and of the music, and to express  from our hearts as much of the meaning of poet and composer as we  understand. All these things are more particularly required of us if  we are singing in parts. The melody must be properly sustained and  must not cover the under parts; while the under parts themselves  should never intrude upon the melody, nor fail to be a good background  for it. The singing of part music is one of the best ways to train the  attention--that is, to get Concentration. As we sing our part we must  have in mind these things:          I. To keep to it and not be drawn away by another part.       II. To give the part we sing its due prominence.      III. Never to destroy the perfect equality of the parts by unduly         hastening or holding back.       IV. To remember that each part is important. The other singers have         as much to think of and to do as we have, and they are entitled         to just as much praise.        V. To be alert to take up our part at exactly the right place.       VI. To put the full meaning of the poet and of the composer into         every word and tone.    These, after all, are only a few of the things; but from them we may  learn this, that to sing (and to play is quite the same) is one of the  most delicate tasks we can learn to perform, requiring attention from  us in many ways at the same time. Even now the usefulness of music is  clear, for the faculties we learn to employ in music form a power that  can be applied in anything.    But music has even a greater reward for us than this. It presents to  us many kinds of thoughts and pictures,--of bravery, of  thoughtfulness, of gaiety, and others without number--and then it  demands that we shall study so as to sing them truthfully from our  hearts. And when we can do this music is then a joy to us and to  others.    Now we see that music, just like the other studies, is useful and  gives us the power to do something. And besides its use and power it  is, perhaps more than any other study, the greatest means of giving  happiness to others. But of that there is yet a word to be said. That  shall be our next Talk.          CHAPTER XXIV.    HOW ONE THING HELPS ANOTHER.        \"Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday    life.\"--_Berthold Auerbach._    Just at the end of our Talk about Music in School, I said that music  was the most powerful of all the studies for giving joy to others. In  this Talk we shall try to learn what the studies do for each other.    Once more--and we must never get tired if the same thought comes again  and again--let us remember that music is thought expressed in tone.  Classic music is great and strong thought; poor, unworthy music is  weak, perhaps wrong or mean thought.    Further, we have learned that thought may be good and pure, and yet  that of itself is not sufficient. It must be well expressed. In short,  to thought of the right sort we must add knowledge, so that it may be  set before others in the right way.    Now, it is true that the more knowledge we have, the more we can do  with music. We can put more meaning into it; we can better perform all  the exacting duties it demands; we can draw more meaning from its art,  and we can see more clearly how great a genius the composer is.  Besides these things, a well-trained mind gets more thoughts from a  subject than an untrained mind. Some day you will see this more  clearly by observing how much better you will be able to understand  your own language by possessing a knowledge of Greek and Latin.    All the school studies have a use, to be sure--a direct use--in giving  us something to help us in life in one way and another. But besides  this, we get another help from study; namely, the employment of the  mind in the right way. For the right way of doing things which are  worthy of the heart, gives power and good. It is the wrong way of  doing things that causes us trouble. Some studies demand exactness  above all this,--like the study of Arithmetic--others a good  memory,--like History--others tax many faculties, as we have seen in  our Talk about School Music.    Some of the studies are particularly valuable to us at once because  they make us _do_. They may be called _doing_ studies. In Arithmetic  there is a result, and only one result, to be sought. In Grammar every  rule we learn is to be applied in our speech. Manual training demands  judgment and the careful use of the hands. Penmanship is a test for  the hand, but History is a study touching the memory more than the  doing faculty.    School music, you see at once, is a doing study. Not only that, it is  full of life, attractive, appealing to the thoughts in many ways, and  yet it is a hearty study--by that I mean a study for the heart.    If you have noticed in your piano music the Italian words which are  given at the beginning of compositions, you may have thought how  expressive most of them are of the heart and of action. They are  _doing_ words particularly. _Allegro_ is cheerful; that is its true  meaning. It directs us to make the music sound cheerful as we sing it  or play it. What for? So that the cheerfulness of the composer shall  be for us and for other people. And _Vivace_ is not merely quickly,  but vivaciously. Now what does vivacious mean? It means what its  root-word _vivere_ means, to live. It is a direction that the music  must be full of life; and the true life of happiness and freedom from  care is meant. So with _Modcrato_, a doing word which tells us very  particularly how to do; namely, not too fast, spoiling it by haste,  nor too slowly, so that it seems to drag, but in a particular way,  that is, with moderation.    Music takes its place as a _doing_ study; and as we have already  discovered, its doing is of many kinds, all requiring care. Singing or  playing is doing; reading the notes is doing; studying out the  composer's meaning is doing; making others feel it is doing;  everything is doing; and _doing_ is true living, _provided it is  unselfish_.    Let us see if there is not a simple lesson in all this. To seek it we  shall have to say old thoughts over again. Music itself uses the same  tones over and over again; it is by doing so that we begin to  understand tone a little.    The school studies try the mind; with the tasks increased bit by bit,  the mind is made stronger. Thus is Strength gained. By the tasks  demanding exactness, the thoughts must not be scattered everywhere,  but centered upon the thing to be done. Thus is Concentration gained.  By making the hand work with care and a definite purpose, Skill is  gained. By demanding of the thoughts that they must seek out all the  qualities of an object, Attention is gained. By placing things and  signs for things before us, we are taught to See. By educating us in  sounds, we are taught to Listen. When we have a task that admits of a  single correct result, we are taught Exactness.    Now, from all we have learned in these Talks about music it must be  clear that all these qualities are just what are needed in music:        I. Strength of thought for Real doing.       II. Concentration for Right doing.      III. Skill for Well doing.       IV. Seeing and listening for the cultivation of Attention.        V. Correctness for the Manner of doing.    We sought for a simple lesson. It is this:    Let us learn all we can that is right and worthy for the strengthening  of the mind, for the cultivation of the heart, for the good and joy of  others; for these things are the spirit of music.          CHAPTER XXV.    THE CHILD AT PLAY.        \"When the long day is past, the steps turn homeward.\"    Once a child played on the sea-shore. The waves sang and the sand  shone and the pebbles glistened. There was light everywhere; light  from the blue sky, and from the moving water, and from the gleaming  pebbles.    The little one, in its happiness, sang with the murmuring sea and  played with the stones and the shells that lay about. Joy was  everywhere and the child was filled with it.    But the day passed. And the little one grieved in its heart to leave  the beautiful place. Delight was there and many rare things that one  could play with and enjoy.    The child could not leave them all. Its heart ached to think of them  lying there alone by the sea. And it thought:    \"I will take the pebbles and the shells with me and I will try to  remember the sunlight and the song of the sea.\"    So it began to fill its little hands. But it saw that after as many as  possible were gathered together there were yet myriads left. And it  had to leave them.    Tired and with a sore heart it trudged homeward, its hands filled to  overflowing with the pebbles that shone in the sun on the sea-shore.  Now, however, they seemed dull. And because of this, the child did not  seem to regret it so much if now and then one fell. \"There are still  some left in my hands,\" it thought.    At length it came near to its home; so very tired, the little limbs  could scarcely move. And one who loved the child came out smiling to  welcome it. The little one went up close and rested its tired head;  and opening its little hand, soiled with the sea and the sand, said:    \"Look, mother, I still have one. May I go for the others some day?\"    And the mother said:    \"Yes, thou shalt go again.\"    And the child fell asleep to dream of the singing sea and of the  sunlight, for these were in its heart.

No royal road leads to Nirvana's rest;    No royal captain guides his army there.    Why leave the heights with so much labor gained?    Why plunge in darkness we have just escaped?    Men will not heed the message we may bring.    The great will scorn, the rabble will deride,[6]    And cry 'He hath a devil and is mad.'\"      \"True,\" answered Buddha, \"each must seek to find;    Each for himself must leave the downward road;    Each for himself must choose the narrow path    That leads to purity and peace and life.    But helping hands will aid those struggling up;    A warning voice may check those hasting down.    Men are like lilies in yon shining pool:    Some sunk in evil grovel in the dust,    Loving like swine to wallow in the mire--    Like those that grow within its silent depths,    Scarce raised above its black and oozy bed;    While some love good, and seek the purest light,    Breathing sweet fragrance from their gentle lives--    Like those that rise above its glassy face,    Sparkling with dewdrops, royally arrayed,    Drinking the brightness of the morning sun,    Distilling odors through the balmy air;    But countless multitudes grope blindly on,    Shut out from light and crushed by cruel castes,    Willing to learn, whom none will deign to teach,    Willing to rise, whom none will deign to guide,    Who from the cradle to the silent grave,    Helpless and hopeless, only toil and weep--    Like those that on the stagnant waters float,    Smothered with leaves, covered with ropy slime,    That from the rosy dawn to dewy eve    Scarce catch one glimmer of the glorious sun.    The good scarce need, the bad will scorn, my aid;    But these poor souls will gladly welcome help.    Welcome to me the scorn of rich and great,    Welcome the Brahman's proud and cold disdain,    Welcome revilings from the rabble rout,    If I can lead some groping souls to light--    If I can give some weary spirits rest.    Farewell, my brother, you have earned release--    Rest here in peace.  I go to aid the poor.\"    And as he spoke a flash of lurid light    Shot through the air, and Buddha stood alone--    Alone! to teach the warring nations peace!    Alone! to lead a groping world to light!    Alone! to give the heavy-laden rest!      [1]A sakwal was a sun with its system of worlds, which the ancient  Hindoos believed extended one beyond another through infinite space.  It indicates great advance in astronomical knowledge when such a  complex idea, now universally received as true, as that the fixed stars  are suns with systems of worlds like ours, could be expressed in a  single word.    [2]It may seem like an anachronism to put the very words of the modern  agnostic into the mouth of Buddha's tempter, but these men are merely  threshing over old straw.  The sneer of Epicurus curled the lip of  Voltaire, and now merely breaks out into a broad laugh on the  good-natured face of Ingersoll.    [3]The Sanscrit, the most perfect of all languages, and the mother of  Greek and of all the languages of the Aryan races, now spread over the  world, had gone out of use in Buddha's time, and the Pali, one of its  earliest offspring, was used by the great teacher and his people.    [4]Arnold follows the tradition, that there was but one, whom he makes  a young wife, without any authority so far as I can learn.  I prefer to  follow the Chinese pilgrim, Fa Hian, who was on the ground with every  means of knowing, who makes them two young girls, and named as above.    [5]Bishop Heber says he saw a recluse whose hands had been clinched so  close and so long that the nails had actually grown through the hands  as here described.    [6]The last temptation of Buddha was to keep his light to himself under  the fear that men would reject his message.            BOOK VI.      Seven days had passed since first he saw the light,    Seven days of deep, ecstatic peace and joy,    Of open vision of that blissful world,    Of sweet communion with those dwelling there.    But having tasted, seen and felt the joys    Of that bright world where love is all in all,    Filling each heart, inspiring every thought,    Guiding each will and prompting every act,    He yearned to see the other, darker side    Of that bright picture, where the wars and hates,    The lust, the greed, the cruelty and crime    That fill the world with pain and want and woe    Have found their dwelling-place and final goal.      Quicker than eagles soaring toward the sun    Till but a speck against the azure vault    Swoop down upon their unsuspecting prey,    Quicker than watch-fires on the mountain-top    Send warnings to the dwellers in the plain,    Led by his guides he reached Nirvana's verge,    Whence he beheld a broad and pleasant plain,    Spread with a carpet of the richest green    And decked with flowers of every varied tint,    Whose blended odors fill the balmy air,    Where trees, pleasant to sight and good for food,    In rich abundance and spontaneous grow.    A living stream, as purest crystal clear,    With gentle murmurs wound along the plain,    Its surface bright with fairer lotus-flowers    Than mortal eye on earth had ever seen,    While on its banks were cool, umbrageous groves    Whose drooping branches spicy breezes stir,    A singing bird in every waving bough,    Whose joyful notes the soul of music shed.      A mighty multitude, beyond the power    Of men to number, moved about the plain;    Some, seeming strangers, wander through the groves    And pluck the flowers or eat the luscious fruits;    Some, seeming visitors from better worlds,    Here wait and watch as for expected guests;    While angel devas, clothed in innocence,    Whose faces beam with wisdom, glow with love,    With loving welcomes greet each coming guest,    With loving counsels aid, instruct and guide.    And as he looked, the countless, restless throng    Seemed ever changing, ever moving on,    So that this plain, comparing great to small,    Seemed like a station near some royal town,    Greater than London or old Babylon,    Where all the roads from some vast empire meet,    And many caravans or sweeping trains    Bring and remove the ever-changing throng.    This plain a valley bordered, deep and still,    The very valley of his fearful dream    Seen from the other side, whose rising mists    Were all aglow with ever-changing light,    Like passing clouds above the setting sun,    Through which as through a glass he darkly saw    Unnumbered funeral-trains, in sable clad,    To solemn music and with measured tread    Bearing their dead to countless funeral-piles,    As thick as heaps that through the livelong day    With patient toil the sturdy woodmen rear,    While clearing forests for the golden grain,    And set aflame when evening's shades descend,    Filling the glowing woods with floods of light    And ghostly shadows: So these funeral-piles    Send up their curling smoke and crackling flames.      There eager flames devour an infant's flesh;    Here loving arms that risen infant clasp;    There loud laments bewail a loved one lost;    Here joyful welcomes greet that loved one found.    And there he saw a pompous funeral-train,    Bearing a body clothed in robes of state,    To blare of trumpet, sound of shell and drum,    While many mourners bow in silent grief,    And widows, orphans raise a loud lament    As for a father, a protector lost;    And as the flames lick up the fragrant oils,    And whirl and hiss around that wasting form,    An eager watcher from a better world    Welcomes her husband to her open arms,    The cumbrous load of pomp and power cast off,    While waiting devas and the happy throng    His power protected and his bounty blessed    With joy conduct his unaccustomed steps    Onward and upward, to those blissful seats    Where all his stores of duties well performed,    Of power well used and wealth in kindness given,    Were garnered up beyond the reach of thieves,    Where moths ne'er eat and rust can ne'er corrupt.      Another train draws near a funeral-pile,    Of aloes, sandal-wood and cassia built,    And drenched with every incense-breathing oil,    And draped with silks and rich with rarest flowers,    Where grim officials clothed in robes of state    Placed one in royal purple, decked with gems,    Whose word had been a trembling nation's law,    Whose angry nod was death to high or low.    No mourners gather round this costly pile;    The people shrink in terror from the sight.    But sullen soldiers there keep watch and ward    While eager flames consume those nerveless hands    So often raised to threaten or command,    Suck out those eyes that filled the court with fear,    And only left of all this royal pomp    A little dust the winds may blow away.      But here that selfsame monarch comes in view,    For royal purple clothed in filthy rags,    And lusterless that crown of priceless gems;    Those eyes, whose bend so lately awed the world,    Blinking and bleared and blinded by the light;    Those hands, that late a royal scepter bore,    Shaking with fear and dripping all with blood.    And as he looked that some should give him place    And lead him to a seat for monarchs fit,    He only saw a group of innocents    His hands had slain, now clothed in spotless white,    From whom he fled as if by furies chased,    Fled from those groves and gardens of delight,    Fled on and down a broad and beaten road    By many trod, and toward a desert waste    With distance dim, and gloomy, grim and vast,    Where piercing thorns and leafless briars grow,    And"]]]
