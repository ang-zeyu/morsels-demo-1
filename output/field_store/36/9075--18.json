They saw only the  first jump, where Andy, riding loose and unguardedly, went up on the  blue withers. The second, third and fourth jumps were not far enough  apart to be seen and judged separately; as well may one hope to decide  whether a whirling wheel had straight or crooked spokes. The fifth  jump, however, was a masterpiece of rapid-fire contortion, and it was  important because it left Andy on the ground, gazing, with an  extremely grieved expression, at the uninterrupted convolutions of the  \"dandy little cow-hoss.\"    The blue roan never stopped so much as to look back. He was  busy--exceedingly busy. He was one of those perverted brutes which  buck and bawl and so keep themselves wrought up to a high  pitch--literally and figuratively. He set himself seriously to throw  Andy's saddle over his head, and he was not a horse which easily  accepts defeat. Andy walked around in the middle of the corral, quite  aimlessly, and watched the roan contort. He could not understand in  the least, and his amazement overshadowed, for the moment, the fact  that he had been thrown and that in public and before men of the  Diamond G.    Then it was that the men of the Diamond G yelled shrill words of  ironical sympathy. Then it was that the Happy Family looked at one  another in shamed silence, and to the taunts of the Diamond Gs made no  reply. It had never occurred to them that such a thing could happen.  Had they not seen Andy ride, easily and often? Had they not heard from  Pink how Andy had performed that difficult feat at the Rocking R--the  feat of throwing his horse flat in the middle of a jump? They waited  until the roan, leaving the big corral looking, in the fast deepening  twilight, like a fresh-ploughed field, stopped dejectedly and stood  with his nose against the closed gate, and then climbed slowly down  from the top rail of the corral, still silent with the silence more  eloquent than speech in any known language.    Over by the gate, Andy was yanking savagely at the latigo; and he,  also, had never a word to say. He was still wondering how it had  happened. He looked the roan over critically and shook his head  against the riddle; for he had known him to be a quiet, dependable,  all-round good horse, with no bad traits and an easy-going disposition  that fretted at nothing. A high-strung, nervous beast might, from  rough usage and abuse, go \"bad\"; but the blue roan--they had called  him Pardner--had never showed the slightest symptom of nerves. Andy  knew horses as he knew himself. That a horse like Pardner should, in  two years, become an evil-tempered past-master in such devilish  pitching as that, was past belief.    \"I guess he'll do, all right,\" spoke Coleman at his elbow. \"I've seen  horses pitch, and I will say that he's got some specialties that are  worth exhibiting.\" Then, as a polite way of letting Andy down easy, he  added, \"I don't wonder you couldn't connect.\"    \"Connect--_hell_!\" It was Andy's first realization of what his failure  meant to the others. He left off wondering about the roan, and faced  the fact that he had been thrown, fair and square, and that before an  audience of twenty-five pairs of eyes which had seen rough riding  before, and which had expected of him something better than they were  accustomed to seeing.    \"I reckon Billy Roberts will have to work on that cayuse a while,\"  fleered a Diamond G man, coming over to them. \"He'll gentle him down  so that anybody--_even Green_, can ride him!\"    Andy faced him hotly, opened his mouth for sharp reply, and closed it.  He had been \"piled.\" Nothing that he could say might alter that fact,  nor explanations lighten the disgrace. He turned and went out the  gate, carrying his saddle and bridle with him.    \"Aw--and you was goin' t' ride in that contest!\" wailed Happy Jack  recriminatingly. \"And I've got forty dollars up on yuh!\"    \"Shut up!\" snapped Pink in his ear, heart-broken but loyal to the  last. \"Yuh going to blat around and let them Diamond Gs give yuh the  laugh? Hunt up something you can use for a backbone till they get out  uh camp, for Heaven's sake! Andy's our man. So help me, Josephine, if  anybody goes rubbing it in where I can hear, he'll get his face  punched!\"    \"Say, I guess we ain't let down on our faces, or anything!\" sighed Cal  Emmett, coming up to them. \"I thought Andy could ride! Gee whiz, but  it was fierce! Why, _Happy_ could make a better ride than that!\"    \"By golly, I want t' have a talk with that there broncho-tamer,\" Slim  growled behind them. \"I got money on him. Is he goin t' ride for that  purse? 'Cause if he is, I ain't going a foot.\"    These and other remarks of a like nature made up the clamor that  surged in the ears of Andy as he went, disgraced and alone, up to the  deserted bunk-house where he need not hear what they were saying. He  knew, deep in his heart, that he could ride that horse. He had been  thrown because of his own unpardonable carelessness--a carelessness  which he could not well explain to the others. He himself had given  the roan an evil reputation; a reputation that, so far as he knew, was  libel pure and simple. To explain now that he was thrown simply  because he never dreamed the horse would pitch, and so was taken  unaware, would simply be to insult their intelligence. He was not  supposed, after mounting a horse like that, to be taken unaware. He  might, of course, say that he had lied all along--but he had no  intention of making any confession like that. Even if he did, they  would not believe him. Altogether, it was a very unhappy young man who  slammed his spurs into a far corner and kicked viciously a box he had  stumbled over in the dusk.    \"Trying to bust the furniture?\" it was the voice of the Old Man at the  door.    \"By gracious, it seems I can't bust _bronks_ no more,\" Andy made  rueful reply. \"I reckon I'll just about have to bust the furniture or  nothing.\"    The Old Man chuckled and came inside, sought the box Andy had kicked,  and sat down upon it. Through the open door came the jumble of many  voices upraised in fruitless argument, and with it the chill of frost.  The Old Man fumbled for his pipe, filled it and scratched a match  sharply on the box. In the flare of it Andy watched his kind old face  with its fringe of grayish hair and its deep-graven lines of whimsical  humor.    \"Doggone them boys, they ain't got the stayin' qualities I give 'em  credit for having,\" he remarked, holding up the match and looking  across at Andy, humped disconsolately in the shadows. \"Them Diamond G  men has just about got 'em on the run, right now. Yuh couldn't get a  hundred-t'-one bet, down there.\"    Andy merely grunted.    \"Say,\" asked the Old Man suddenly. \"Didn't yuh kinda mistake that blue  roan for his twin brother, Pardner? This here cayuse is called Weaver.  I tried t' get hold of t'other one, but doggone 'em, they wouldn't  loosen up. Pardner wasn't for sale at no price, but they talked me  into buying the Weaver; they claimed he's just about as good a horse,  once he's tamed down some--and I thought, seein' I've got some real  _tamers_ on my pay-roll, I'd take a chance on him. I thought yuh knew  the horse--the way yuh read up his pedigree--till I seen yuh mount  him. Why, doggone it, yuh straddled him like yuh was just climbing a  fence! Maybe yuh know your own business best--but didn't yuh kinda  mistake him for Pardner? They're as near alike as two bullets run in  the same mold--as far as _looks_ go.\"    Andy got up and went to the door, and stood looking down the  dusk-muffled hill to the white blotch which was the camp; listened to  the jumble of voices still upraised in fruitless argument, and turned  to the Old Man.    \"By gracious, that accounts for a whole lot,\" he said ambiguously.    II    \"I don't see,\" said Cal Emmett crossly, \"what's the use uh this whole  outfit trailing up to that contest. If I was Chip, I'd call the deal  off and start gathering calves. It ain't as if we had a man to ride  for that belt and purse. Ain't your leg well enough to tackle it,  Pink?\"    \"No,\" Pink answered shortly, \"it ain't.\"    \"Riding the rough bunch they've rounded up for that contest ain't  going to be any picnic,\" Weary defended his chum. \"Cadwolloper would  need two good legs to go up against that deal.\"    \"I wish Irish was here,\" Pink gloomed. \"I'd be willing to back him;  all right. But it's too late now; he couldn't enter if he was here.\"    A voice behind them spoke challengingly. \"I don't believe it would be  etiquette for one outfit to enter _two_ peelers. One's enough, ain't  it?\"    The Happy Family turned coldly upon the speaker. It was Slim who  answered for them all. \"I dunno as this outfit has got _any_ peeler in  that contest. By golly, it don't look like it since las' night!\"    Weary was gentle, as always, but he was firm. \"We kinda thought you'd  want to withdraw,\" he added.    Andy Green, tamer of wild ones, turned and eyed Weary curiously. One  might guess, from telltale eyes and mouth, that his calmness did not  go very deep. \"I don't recollect mentioning that I was busy penning  any letter uh withdrawal,\" he said. \"I got my sights raised to that  purse and that belt. I don't recollect saying anything about lowering  'em.\"    \"Aw, gwan. I guess _I'll_ try for that purse, too! I betche I got as  good a show as--\"    \"Sure. Help yourself, it don't cost nothing. I don't doubt but what  you'd make a real pretty ride, Happy.\" Andy's tone was deceitfully  hearty. He did not sound in the least as if he would like to choke  Happy Jack, though that was his secret longing.    \"Aw, gwan. I betche I could make as purty a ride as we've  saw--lately.\" Happy Jack did not quite like to make the thing too  personal, for fear of what might happen after.    \"Yuh mean last night, don't yuh?\" purred Andy.    \"Well, by golly, I wish you'd tell us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13678"],[0,"Chapters on Jewish Literature (#16)"],[1,"writes of suffering and death. He offers an  antidote to pessimism, for he boldly asserts that pain and suffering in  themselves are \"a service of God, leading man to ponder on his end and  reflect about his destiny.\" Nachmanides believed in the bodily  resurrection, but held that the soul was in a special sense a direct  emanation from God. He was not a philosopher strictly so-called; he was  a mystic more than a thinker, one to whom God was an intuition, not a  concept of reason.    The greatest work of Nachmanides was his \"Commentary on the Pentateuch.\"  He reveals his whole character in it. In composing his work he had, he  tells us, three motives, an intellectual, a theological, and an  emotional motive. First, he would \"satisfy the minds of students, and  draw their heart out by a critical examination of the text.\" His  exposition is, indeed, based on true philology and on deep and original  study of the Bible. His style is peculiarly attractive, and had he been  content to offer a plain commentary, his work would have ranked among  the best. But he had other desires besides giving a simple explanation  of the text. He had, secondly, a theological motive, to justify God and  discover in the words of Scripture a hidden meaning. In the Biblical  narratives, Nachmanides sees _types_ of the history of man. Thus, the  account of the six days of creation is turned into a prophecy of the  events which would occur during the next six thousand years, and the  seventh day is a type of the millennium. So, too, Nachmanides finds  symbolical senses in Scriptural texts, \"for, in the Torah, are hidden  every wonder and every mystery, and in her treasures is sealed every  beauty of wisdom.\" Finally, Nachmanides wrote, not only for educational  and theological ends, but also for edification. His third purpose was  \"to bring peace to the minds of students (laboring under persecution  and trouble), when they read the portion of the Pentateuch on Sabbaths  and festivals, and to attract their hearts by simple explanations and  sweet words.\" His own enthusiastic and loving temperament speaks in this  part of his commentary. It is true, as Graetz says, that Nachmanides  exercised more influence on his contemporaries and on succeeding ages by  his personality than by his writings. But it must be added that the  writings of Nachmanides are his personality.      BIBLIOGRAPHY    NACHMANIDES.    I.H.

CHAPTER XVII    THE ZOHAR AND LATER MYSTICISM         Kabbala.--The Bahir.--Abulafia.--Moses of Leon.--The       Zohar.--Isaac Lurya.--Isaiah Hurwitz.--Christian       Kabbalists.--The Chassidim.      Mysticism is the name given to the belief in direct, intuitive communion  with God. All true religion has mystical elements, for all true religion  holds that man can commune with God, soul with soul. In the Psalms, God  is the Rock of the heart, the Portion of the cup, the Shepherd and  Light, the Fountain of Life, an exceeding Joy. All this is, in a sense,  _mystical_ language. But mysticism has many dangers. It is apt to  confuse vague emotionalism and even hysteria with communion with God. A  further defect of mysticism is that, in its medieval forms, it tended to  the multiplication of intermediate beings, or angels, which it created  to supply the means for that communion with God which, in theory, the  mystics asserted was direct. Finally, from being a deep-seated,  emotional aspect of religion, mysticism degenerated into intellectual  sport, a play with words and a juggling with symbols.    Jewish mysticism passed through all these stages. Kabbala--as mysticism  was called--really means \"Tradition,\" and the name proves that the  theory had its roots far back in the past. It has just been said that  there is mysticism in the Psalms. So there is in the idea of  inspiration, the prophet's receiving a message direct from God with whom  he spoke face to face. After the prophetic age, Jewish mysticism  displayed itself in intense personal religiousness, as well as in love  for Apocalyptic, or dream, literature, in which the sleeper could, like  Daniel, feel himself lapped to rest in the bosom of God.    All the earlier literary forms of mysticism, or theosophy, made  comparatively little impression on Jewish writers. But at the beginning  of the thirteenth century a great development took place in the \"secret\"  science of the Kabbala. The very period which produced the rationalism  of Maimonides gave birth to the emotionalism of the Kabbala. The Kabbala  was at first a protest against too much intellectualism and rigidity in  religion. It reclaimed religion for the heart. A number of writers more  or less dallied with the subject, and then the Kabbala took a bolder  flight. Ezra, or Azriel, a teacher of Nachmanides, compiled a book  called \"Brilliancy\" (_Bahir_) in the year 1240. It was at once regarded  as a very ancient book. As will be seen, the same pretence of antiquity  was made with regard to another famous Kabbalistic work of a later  generation. Under Todros Abulafia (1234-1304) and Abraham Abulafia  (1240-1291), the mystical movement took a practical shape, and the  Jewish masses were much excited by stories of miracles performed and of  the appearance of a new Messiah.    At this moment Moses of Leon (born in Leon in about 1250, died in  Arevalo in 1305) wrote the most famous Kabbalistic book of the Middle  Ages. This was named, in imitation of the Bahir, \"Splendor\" (_Zohar_),  and its brilliant success matched its title. Not only did this  extraordinary book raise the Kabbala to the zenith of its influence, but  it gave it a firm and, as it has proved, unassailable basis. Like the  Bahir, the Zohar was not offered to the public on its own merits, but  was announced as the work of Simon, the son of Yochai, who lived in the  second century. The Zohar, it was pretended, had been concealed in a  cavern in Galilee for more than a thousand years, and had now been  suddenly discovered. The Zohar is, indeed, a work of genius, its  spiritual beauty, its fancy, its daring imagery, its depth of devotion,  ranking it among the great books of the world. Its literary style,  however, is less meritorious; it is difficult and involved. As  Chatterton clothed his ideas in a pseudo-archaic English, so Moses of  Leon used an Aramaic idiom, which he handled clumsily and not as one to  the manner born. It would not be so important to insist on the fact that  the Zohar was a literary forgery, that it pretended to an antiquity it  did not own, were it not that many Jews and Christians still write as  though they believe that the book is as old as it was asserted to be.  The defects of the Zohar are in keeping with this imposture. Absurd  allegories are read into the Bible; the words of Scripture are counters  in a game of distortion and combination; God himself is obscured amid a  maze of mystic beings, childishly conceived and childishly named.  Philosophically, the Zohar has no originality. Its doctrines of the  Transmigration of the Soul, of the Creation as God's self-revelation in  the world, of the Emanation from the divine essence of semi-human,  semi-divine powers, were only commonplaces of medieval theology. Its  great original idea was that the revealed Word of God, the Torah, was  designed for no other purpose than to effect a union between the soul of  man and the soul of God.    Reinforced by this curious jumble of excellence and nonsense, the  Kabbala became one of the strongest literary bonds between Jews and  Christians. It is hardly to be wondered at, for the Zohar contains some  ideas which are more Christian than Jewish. Christians, like Pico di  Mirandola (1463-1494), under the influence of the Jewish Kabbalist  Jochanan Aleman, and Johann Reuchlin (1455-1522), sharer of Pico's  spirit and precursor of the improved study of the Scriptures in Europe,  made the Zohar the basis of their defence of Jewish literature against  the attempts of various ecclesiastical bodies to crush and destroy it.    The Kabbala did not, however, retain a high place in the realm of  literature. It greatly influenced Jewish religious ceremonies, it  produced saintly souls, and from such centres as Safed and Salonica sent  forth men like Solomon Molcho and Sabbatai Zevi, who maintained that  they were Messiahs, and could perform miracles on the strength of  Kabbalistic powers. But from the literary stand-point the Kabbala was a  barren inspiration. The later works of Kabbalists are a rehash of the  older works. The Zohar was the bible of the Kabbalists, and the later  works of the school were commentaries on this bible. The Zohar had  absorbed all the earlier Kabbalistic literature, such as the \"Book of  Creation\" (_Sefer Yetsirah_), the Book Raziel, the Alphabet of Rabbi  Akiba, and it was the final literary expression of the Kabbala.    It is, therefore, unnecessary to do more than name one or two of the  more noted Kabbalists of post-Zoharistic ages. Isaac Lurya (1534-1572)  was a saint, so devoid of self-conceit that he published nothing, though  he flourished at the very time when the printing-press was throwing  copies of the Zohar broadcast. We owe our knowledge of Lurya's  Kabbalistic ideas to the prolific writings of his disciple Chayim Vital  Calabrese, who died in Damascus in 1620. Other famous Kabbalists were  Isaiah Hurwitz (about 1570-1630), author of a much admired ethical work,  \"The Two Tables of the Covenant\" (_Sheloh_, as it is familiarly called  from the initials of its Hebrew title); Nehemiah Chayun (about  1650-1730); and the Hebrew dramatist Moses Chayim Luzzatto (1707-1747).
