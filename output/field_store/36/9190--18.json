[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16287"],[0,"Talks To Teachers On Psychology; And To Students On Some Of Life's Ideals (#16)"],[1,"we may  recall, provided a sufficient cue be offered. Both the general retention  and the special recall are explained by association. An educated memory  depends on an organized system of associations; and its goodness depends  on two of their peculiarities: first, on the persistency of the  associations; and, second, on their number.    Let us consider each of these points in turn.    First, the persistency of the associations. This gives what may be  called the _quality of native retentiveness_ to the individual. If, as I  think we are forced to, we consider the brain to be the organic  condition by which the vestiges of our experience are associated with  each other, we may suppose that some brains are 'wax to receive and  marble to retain.' The slightest impressions made on them abide. Names,  dates, prices, anecdotes, quotations, are indelibly retained, their  several elements fixedly cohering together, so that the individual soon  becomes a walking cyclopaedia of information. All this may occur with no  philosophic tendency in the mind, no impulse to weave the materials  acquired into anything like a logical system. In the books of anecdotes,  and, more recently, in the psychology-books, we find recorded instances  of monstrosities, as we may call them, of this desultory memory; and  they are often otherwise very stupid men. It is, of course, by no means  incompatible with a philosophic mind; for mental characteristics have  infinite capacities for permutation. And, when both memory and  philosophy combine together in one person, then indeed we have the  highest sort of intellectual efficiency. Your Walter Scotts, your  Leibnitzes, your Gladstones, and your Goethes, all your folio copies of  mankind, belong to this type. Efficiency on a colossal scale would  indeed seem to require it. For, although your philosophic or systematic  mind without good desultory memory may know how to work out results and  recollect where in the books to find them, the time lost in the  searching process handicaps the thinker, and gives to the more ready  type of individual the economical advantage.    The extreme of the contrasted type, the type with associations of small  persistency, is found in those who have almost no desultory memory at  all. If they are also deficient in logical and systematizing power, we  call them simply feeble intellects; and no more need to be said about  them here. Their brain-matter, we may imagine, is like a fluid jelly, in  which impressions may be easily made, but are soon closed over again, so  that the brain reverts to its original indifferent state.    But it may occur here, just as in other gelatinous substances, that an  impression will vibrate throughout the brain, and send waves into other  parts of it. In cases of this sort, although the immediate impression  may fade out quickly, it does modify the cerebral mass; for the paths it  makes there may remain, and become so many avenues through which the  impression may be reproduced if they ever get excited again. And its  liability to reproduction will depend of course upon the variety of  these paths and upon the frequency with which they are used. Each path  is in fact an associated process, the number of these associates  becoming thus to a great degree a substitute for the independent  tenacity of the original impression. As I have elsewhere written: Each  of the associates is a hook to which it hangs, a means to fish it up  when sunk below the surface. Together they form a network of attachments  by which it is woven into the entire tissue of our thought. The 'secret  of a good memory' is thus the secret of forming diverse and multiple  associations with every fact we care to retain. But this forming of  associations with a fact,--what is it but thinking _about_ the fact as  much as possible? Briefly, then, of two men with the same outward  experiences, _the one who thinks over his experiences most_, and weaves  them into the most systematic relations with each other, will be the one  with the best memory.    But, if our ability to recollect a thing be so largely a matter of its  associations with other things which thus becomes its cues, an important  paedagogic consequence follows. _There can be no improvement of the  general or elementary faculty of memory: there can only be improvement  of our memory for special systems of associated things_; and this  latter improvement is due to the way in which the things in question are  woven into association with each other in the mind. Intricately or  profoundly woven, they are held: disconnected, they tend to drop out  just in proportion as the native brain retentiveness is poor. And no  amount of training, drilling, repeating, and reciting employed upon the  matter of one system of objects, the history-system, for example, will  in the least improve either the facility or the durability with which  objects belonging to a wholly disparate system--the system of facts of  chemistry, for instance--tend to be retained. That system must be  separately worked into the mind by itself,--a chemical fact which is  thought about in connection with the other chemical facts, tending then  to stay, but otherwise easily dropping out.    We have, then, not so much a faculty of memory as many faculties of  memory. We have as many as we have systems of objects habitually thought  of in connection with each other. A given object is held in the memory  by the associates it has acquired within its own system exclusively.  Learning the facts of another system will in no wise help it to stay in  the mind, for the simple reason that it has no 'cues' within that other  system.    We see examples of this on every hand. Most men have a good memory for  facts connected with their own pursuits. A college athlete, who remains  a dunce at his books, may amaze you by his knowledge of the 'records' at  various feats and games, and prove himself a walking dictionary of  sporting statistics. The reason is that he is constantly going over  these things in his mind, and comparing and making series of them. They  form for him, not so many odd facts, but a concept-system, so they  stick. So the merchant remembers prices, the politician other  politicians' speeches and votes, with a copiousness which astonishes  outsiders, but which the amount of thinking they bestow on these  subjects easily explains.    The great memory for facts which a Darwin or a Spencer reveal in their  books is not incompatible with the possession on their part of a mind  with only a middling degree of physiological retentiveness. Let a man  early in life set himself the task of verifying such a theory as that of  evolution, and facts will soon cluster and cling to him like grapes to  their stem. Their relations to the theory will hold them fast; and, the  more of these the mind is able to discern, the greater the erudition  will become. Meanwhile the theorist may have little, if any, desultory  memory. Unutilizable facts may be unnoted by him, and forgotten as soon  as heard. An ignorance almost as encyclopedic as his erudition may  coexist with the latter, and hide, as it were, within the interstices of  its web. Those of you who have had much to do with scholars and  _savants_ will readily think of examples of the class of mind I mean.    The best possible sort of system into which to weave an object,  mentally, is a _rational_ system, or what is called a 'science.' Place  the thing in its pigeon-hole in a classificatory series; explain it  logically by its causes, and deduce from it its necessary effects; find  out of what natural law it is an instance,--and you then know it in the  best of all possible ways. A 'science' is thus the greatest of  labor-saving contrivances. It relieves the memory of an immense number  of details, replacing, as it does, merely contiguous associations by the  logical ones of identity, similarity, or analogy. If you know a 'law,'  you may discharge your memory of masses of particular instances, for the  law will reproduce them for you whenever you require them. The law of  refraction, for example: If you know that, you can with a pencil and a  bit of paper immediately discern how a convex lens, a concave lens, or a  prism, must severally alter the appearance of an object. But, if you  don't know the general law, you must charge your memory separately with  each of the three kinds of effect.    A 'philosophic' system, in which all things found their rational  explanation and were connected together as causes and effects, would be  the perfect mnemonic system, in which the greatest economy of means  would bring about the greatest richness of results. So that, if we have  poor desultory memories, we can save ourselves by cultivating the  philosophic turn of mind.    There are many artificial systems of mnemonics, some public, some sold  as secrets. They are all so many devices for training us into certain  methodical and stereotyped _ways of thinking_ about the facts we seek to  retain. Even were I competent, I could not here go into these systems in  any detail. But a single example, from a popular system, will show what  I mean. I take the number-alphabet, the great mnemonic device for  recollecting numbers and dates. In this system each digit is  represented by a consonant, thus: 1 is _t_ or _d_; 2, _n_; 3, _m_; 4,  _r_; 5, _l_; 6, _sh, j, ch_, or _g_; 7, _c, k, g_, or _qu_; 8, _f_ or  _v_; 9, _b_ or _p_; 0, _s, c_, or _z_. Suppose, now, you wish to  remember the velocity of sound, 1,142 feet a second: _t, t, r, n_, are  the letters you must use. They make the consonants of _tight run_, and  it would be a 'tight run' for you to keep up such a speed. So 1649, the  date of the execution of Charles I., may be remembered by the word  _sharp_, which recalls the headsman's axe.    Apart from the extreme difficulty of finding words that are appropriate  in this exercise, it is clearly an excessively poor, trivial, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#16)"],[1,"hik. XI, 41, 42).--Exclusion of the  fallen urdhvaretas in certain cases (Adhik. XII, 43).--Those  meditations, which are connected with subordinate members of the  sacrifice, are the business of the priest, not of the yajamana (Adhik.  XIII, 44-46).--B/ri/. Up. III, 5, 1 enjoins mauna as a third in addition  to balya and pa/nd/itya (Adhik. XIV, 47-49).--By balya is to be  understood a childlike innocent state of mind (Adhik. XV, 50).    Sutras 51 and 52 discuss, according to Ramanuja, the question when the  vidya, which is the result of the means described in III, 4, arises.  Sutra 51 treats of that vidya whose result is mere exaltation  (abhyudaya), and states that 'it takes place in the present life, if  there is not present an obstacle in the form of a prabalakarmantara (in  which latter case the vidya arises later only), on account of Scripture  declaring this (in various passages).'--Sutra 52, 'Thus there is also  absence of a definite rule as to (the time of origination of) that  knowledge whose fruit is release, it being averred concerning that one  also that it is in the same condition (i.e. of sometimes having an  obstacle, sometimes not).'--/S/a@nkara, who treats the two Sutras as two  adhikara/n/as, agrees as to the explanation of 51, while, putting a  somewhat forced interpretation on 52, he makes it out to mean that a  more or less is possible only in the case of the sagu/n/a-vidyas.    Notes:    [Footnote 16: All the mentioned modes of Brahman are known from  Scripture only, not from ordinary experience. If the latter were the  case, then, and then only, Scripture might at first refer to them  'anuvadena,' and finally negative them.]    [Footnote 17: Ramanuja has here some strong remarks on the improbability  of qualities emphatically attributed to Brahman, in more than one  passage, having to be set aside in any meditation: 'Na /k/a  matapit/ri/sahasrebhyo-pi vatsalatara/m/ sastra/m/ pratarakavad  aparamarthikau nirasaniyau gu/n/au prama/n/antarapratipannau  adare/n/opadi/s/ya sa/m/sara/k/akraparivartanena purvam eva  bambhramyamanan mumukshun bhuyo-pi bhramayitum alam.']    [Footnote 18: The /S/ri-bh-ashya as well as several other commentaries  reads tadbhavabhavitvat for /S/an@kara's tadbhavabhavitvat.]      FOURTH ADHYAYA.  PADA I.      Adhikara/n/a I (1, 2).--The meditation on the Atman enjoined by  Scripture is not an act to be accomplished once only, but is to be  repeated again and again.    Adhik. II (3).--The devotee engaged in meditation on Brahman is to view  it as constituting his own Self.    Adhik. III (4).--To the rule laid down in the preceding adhikara/n/a the  so-called pratikopasanas, i.e. those meditations in which Brahman is  viewed under a symbol or outward manifestation (as, for instance, mano  brahmety upasita) constitute an exception, i.e. the devotee is not to  consider the pratika as constituting his own Self.    Adhik. IV (5).--In the pratikopasanas the pratika is to be meditatively  viewed as being one with Brahman, not Brahman as being one with the  pratika.--Ramanuja takes Sutra 5 as simply giving a reason for the  decision arrived at under Sutra 4, and therefore as not constituting a  new adhikara/n/a.    Adhik. V (6).--In meditations connected with constitutives of  sacrificial works (as, for instance, ya evasau tapati tam udgitham  upasita) the idea of the divinity, &c. is to be transferred to the  sacrificial item, not vice versa. In the example quoted, for instance,  the udgitha is to be viewed as Aditya, not Aditya as the udgitha.    Adhik. VI (7-10).--The devotee is to carry on his meditations in a  sitting posture.--/S/a@nkara maintains that this rule does not apply to  those meditations whose result is sa/m/yagdar/s/ana; but the Sutra gives  no hint to that effect.    Adhik. VII (11).--The meditations may be carried on at any time, and in  any place, favourable to concentration of mind.    Adhik. VIII (12).--The meditations are to be continued until  death.--/S/a@nkara again maintains that those meditations which lead to  sa/m/yagdar/s/ana are excepted.    Adhik. IX (13).--When through those meditations the knowledge of Brahman  has been reached, the vidvan is no longer affected by the consequences  of either past or future evil deeds.    Adhik. X (14).--Good deeds likewise lose their efficiency.--The literal  translation of the Sutra is, 'There is likewise non-attachment (to the  vidvan) of the other (i.e. of the deeds other than the evil ones, i.e.  of good deeds), but on the fall (of the body, i.e. when death takes  place).' The last words of the Sutra, 'but on the fall,' are separated  by /S/a@nkara from the preceding part of the Sutra and interpreted to  mean, 'when death takes place (there results mukti of the vidvan, who  through his knowledge has freed himself from the bonds of  works).'--According to Ramanuja the whole Sutra simply means, 'There is  likewise non-attachment of good deeds (not at once when knowledge is  reached), but on the death of the vidvan[19].'    Adhik. XI (15).--The non-operation of works stated in the two preceding  adhikara/n/as holds good only in the case of anarabdhakarya works, i.e.  those works which have not yet begun to produce their effects, while it  does not extend to the arabdhakarya works on which the present existence  of the devotee depends.    Adhik. XII (16, 17).--From the rule enunciated in Adhik. X are excepted  such sacrificial performances as are enjoined permanently (nitya): so,  for instance, the agnihotra, for they promote the origination of  knowledge.    Adhik. XIII (18).--The origination of knowledge is promoted also by such  sacrificial works as are not accompanied with the knowledge of the  upasanas referring to the different members of those works.    Adhik. XIV (19).--The arabdhakarya works have to be worked out fully by  the fruition of their effects; whereupon the vidvan becomes united with  Brahman.--The 'bhoga' of the Sutra is, according to /S/a@nkara,  restricted to the present existence of the devotee, since the complete  knowledge obtained by him destroys the nescience which otherwise would  lead to future embodiments. According to Ramanuja a number of embodied  existences may have to be gone through before the effects of the  arabdhakarya works are exhausted.      PADA II.      This and the two remaining padas of the fourth adhyaya describe the fate  of the vidvan after death. According to /S/a@nkara we have to  distinguish the vidvan who possesses the highest knowledge, viz. that he  is one with the highest Brahman, and the vidvan who knows only the lower  Brahman, and have to refer certain Sutras to the former and others to  the latter. According to Ramanuja the vidvan is one only.    Adhik. I, II, III (1-6).--On the death of the vidvan (i.e. of him who  possesses the lower knowledge, according to /S/a@nkara) his senses are  merged in the manas, the manas in the chief vital air (pra/n/a), the  vital air in the individual soul (jiva), the soul in the subtle  elements.--According to Ramanuja the combination (sampatti) of the  senses with the manas, &c. is a mere conjunction (sa/m/yoga), not a  merging (laya).    Adhik. IV (7).--The vidvan (i.e. according to /S/a@nkara, he who  possesses the lower knowledge) and the avidvan, i.e. he who does not  possess any knowledge of Brahman, pass through the same stages (i.e.  those described hitherto) up to the entrance of the soul, together with  the subtle elements, and so on into the na/d/is.--The vidvan also  remains connected with the subtle elements because he has not yet  completely destroyed avidya, so that the immortality which Scripture  ascribes to him (am/ri/tatva/m/ hi vidvan abhya/s/nute) is only a  relative one.--Ramanuja quotes the following text regarding the  immortality of the vidvan:        'Yada sarve pramu/k/yante kama yessya h/ri/di sthita/h/ atha      martyosm/ri/to bhavaty atra brahma sama/s/nute,'    and explains that the immortality which is here ascribed to the vidvan  as soon as he abandons all desires can only mean the  destruction--mentioned in the preceding pada--of all the effects of good  and evil works, while the 'reaching of Brahman' can only refer to the  intuition of Brahman vouchsafed to the meditating devotee.    Adhik. V (8-11) raises; according to /S/a@nkara, the question whether  the subtle elements of which Scripture says that they are combined with  the highest deity (teja/h/ parasya/m/ devatayam) are completely merged  in the latter or not. The answer is that a complete absorption of the  elements takes place only when final emancipation is reached; that, on  the other hand, as long as the sa/m/sara state lasts, the elements,  although somehow combined with Brahman, remain distinct so as to be able  to form new bodies for the soul.    According to Ramanuja the Sutras 8-11 do not constitute a new  adhikara/n/a, but continue the discussion of the point mooted in 7. The  immortality there spoken of does not imply the separation of the soul  from the body, 'because Scripture declares sa/m/sara, i.e. embodiedness  up to the reaching of Brahman' (tasya tavad eva /k/ira/m/ yavan na  vimokshye atha sampatsye) (8).--That the soul after having departed from  the gross body is not disconnected from the subtle elements, is also  proved hereby, that the subtle body accompanies it, as is observed from  authority[20] (9).--Hence the immortality referred to in the scriptural  passage quoted is not effected by means of the total destruction of the  body (10).    Adhik. VI (12-14) is of special importance.--According to /S/a@nkara the  Sutras now turn from the discussion of the departure of him who  possesses the lower knowledge only to the consideration of what becomes  of him who has reached the higher knowledge. So far it has been taught  that in the case of relative immortality (ensuing on the apara vidya)  the subtle elements, together with the senses and so on, depart from the  body of the dying devotee; this"]]]
