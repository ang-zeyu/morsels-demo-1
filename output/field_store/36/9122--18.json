[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14674"],[0,"Ten Great Religions: An Essay in Comparative Theology (#16)"],[1,"e. \"The only magic we employ is prayer to  God.\" The man who said this, says Captain Fishbourne, \"was a little  shrivelled-up person, but he uttered words of courageous confidence in  God, and could utter the words of a hero. He and others like him have  impressed the minds of their followers with their own courage and  morality.\"    The English Bishop of Victoria has constantly given the same testimony. Of  one of the Ti-Ping books Dr. Medhurst says: \"There is not a word in it  which a Christian missionary might not adopt and circulate as a tract for  the benefit of the Chinese.\"    Dr. Medhurst also describes a scene which took place in Shanghae, where he  was preaching in the chapel of the London Missionary Society, on the folly  of idolatry and the duty of worshipping the one true God. A man arose in  the middle of the congregation and said: \"That is true! that is true! the  idols must perish. I am a Ti-Ping; we all worship one God and believe in  Jesus, and we everywhere destroy the idols. Two years ago when we began we  were only three thousand; now we have marched across the Empire, because  God was on our side.\" He then exhorted the people to abandon idolatry and  to believe in Jesus, and said: \"We are happy in our religion, and look on  the day of our death as the happiest moment of life. When any of our  number dies, we do not weep, but congratulate each other because he has  gone to the joy of the heavenly world.\"    The mission of Mr. Burlingame indicated a sincere desire on the part of  the sagacious men who then governed China, especially of Prince Kung, to  enter into relations with modern civilization and modern thought. From the  official papers of this mission,[28] it appears that Mr. Burlingame was  authorized \"to transact all business with the Treaty Powers in which those  countries and China had a common interest,\" (communication of Prince Kung,  December 31, 1867). The Chinese government expressly states that this step  is intended as adopting the customs of diplomatic intercourse peculiar to  the West, and that in so doing the Chinese Empire means to conform to the  law of nations, as understood among the European states. It therefore  adopted \"Wheaton's International Law\" as the text-book and authority to be  used in its Foreign Office, and had it carefully translated into Chinese  for the use of its mandarins. This movement was the result, says Mr.  Burlingame, of the \"co-operative policy\" adopted by the representatives in  China of the Treaty Powers, in which they agreed to act together on all  important questions, to take no cession of territory, and never to menace  the autonomy of the Empire. They agreed \"to leave her perfectly free to  develop herself according to her own form of civilization, not to  interfere with her interior affairs, to make her waters neutral, and her  land safe\" (Burlingame's speech at San Francisco). There is no doubt that  if the states known as the \"Treaty Powers,\" namely, the United States,  Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Holland, Italy, North Germany,  Russia, Spain, and Sweden, will loyally abstain from aggression and  interference in China and respect her independence, that this great  Empire will step forth from her seclusion of fifty centuries, and enter  the commonwealth of nations.    The treaty between the United States and China of July 28, 1868, includes  provisions for the neutrality of the Chinese waters; for freedom of  worship for United States citizens in China, and for the Chinese in the  United States; for allowing voluntary emigration, and prohibiting the  compulsory coolie trade; for freedom to travel in China and the United  States by the citizens of either country; and for freedom to establish and  attend schools in both countries.    We add to this chapter a Note, containing an interesting account, from  Hue's \"Christianity in China,\" of an inscribed stone, proving that  Christian churches existed in China in the seventh century. These churches  were the result of the efforts of Nestorian missionaries, who were the  Protestant Christians of their age. Their success in China is another  proof that the Christianity which is to be welcomed there must be  presented in an intelligible and rational form.           *       *       *       *       *    NOTE.         The Nestorian Inscription in China.[29]         In 1625 some Chinese workmen, engaged in digging a foundation for a     house, outside the walls of the city of Si-ngau-Fou, the capital of the     province of Chen-si, found buried in the earth a large monumental stone     resembling those which the Chinese are in the habit of raising to     preserve to posterity the remembrance of remarkable events and     illustrious men. It was a dark-colored marble tablet, ten feet high and     five broad, and bearing on one side an inscription in ancient Chinese,     and also some other characters quite unknown in China.           *       *       *       *       *       Several exact tracings from the stone were sent to Europe by the     Jesuits who saw it. The library of their house at Rome had one of the     first, and it attracted numerous visitors; subsequently, another     authentic copy of the dimensions of the tablet was sent to Paris, and     deposited at the library in the Rue Richelieu, where it may still be     seen in the gallery of manuscripts.       This monument, discovered by chance amidst rubbish in the environs of     an ancient capital of the Chinese Empire, excited a great sensation;     for on examining the stone, and endeavoring to interpret the     inscription, it was with surprise discovered that the Christian     religion had had numerous apostles in China at the beginning of the     seventh century, and that it had for a long time flourished there. The     strange characters proved to be those called _estrangelhos_, which were     in use among the ancient inhabitants of Syria, and will be found in     some Syriac manuscripts of earlier date than the eighth century.           *       *       *       *       *       _Monument of the great Propagation of the Luminous Doctrine in the     Central Empire, composed by Khing-Tsing, a devout Man of the Temple of     Ta-Thsin._         1. There has always been only one true Cause, essentially the first,     and without beginning, supremely intelligent and immaterial;     essentially the last, and uniting all perfections. He placed the poles     of the heavens and created all beings; marvellously holy, he is the     source of all perfection. This admirable being, is he not the _Triune_,     the true Lord without beginning, _Oloho_?       He divided the world by a cross into four parts. After having     decomposed the primordial air, he gave birth to the two elements.       Chaos was transformed, and then the sun and the moon appeared. He made     the sun and the moon move to produce day and night. He elaborated and     perfected the ten thousand things; but in creating the first man, he     endowed him with perfect interior harmony. He enjoined him to watch     over the sea of his desires. His nature was without vice and without     error; his heart, pure and simple, was originally without disorderly     appetites.       2. But Sa-Thang propagated lies, and stained by his malice that which     had been pure and holy. He proclaimed, as a truth, the equality of     greatness, and upset all ideas. This is why three hundred and     sixty-five sects, lending each other a mutual support, formed a long     chain, and wove, so to speak, a net of law. Some put the creature in     the place of the Eternal, others denied the existence of beings, and     destroyed the two principles. Others instituted prayers and sacrifices     to obtain good fortune; others proclaimed their own sanctity to deceive     mankind. The minds of men labored, and were filled with anxiety;     aspirations after the supreme good were trampled down; thus perpetually     floating about they attained to nothing, and all went from bad to     worse. The darkness thickened, men lost their sight, and for a long     time they wandered without being able to find it again.       3. Then our Triune God communicated his substance to the very venerable     Mi-chi-ho (Messiah), who, veiling his true majesty, appeared in the     world in the likeness of a man. The celestial spirits manifested their     joy, and a virgin brought forth the saint in Ta-Thsin. The most     splendid constellations announced this happy event; the Persians saw     the splendor, and ran to pay tribute. He fulfilled what was said of old     by the twenty-four saints; he organized, by his precepts, both families     and kingdoms; he instituted the new religion according to the true     notion of the Trinity in Unity; he regulated conscience by the true     faith; he signified to the world the eight commandments, and purged     humanity from its pollutions by opening the door to the three virtues.     He diffused life and extinguished death; he suspended the luminous sun     to destroy the dwelling of darkness, and then the lies of demons passed     away. He directed the bark of mercy towards the palace of light, and     all creatures endowed with intelligence have been succored. After     having consummated this act of power, he rose at midday towards the     Truth. Twenty-seven books have been left. He has enlarged the springs     of mercy, that men might be converted. The baptism by water and by the     Spirit is a law that purifies the soul and beautifies the exterior. The     sign of the cross unites the four quarters of the world, and restores     the harmony that had been destroyed. By striking upon a piece of wood,     we make the voice of charity and mercy resound; by sacrificing towards     the east we indicate the way of life and glory.       Our ministers allow their beards to grow, to show that they are devoted     to their neighbors. The tonsure that they wear at the top of their  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 1 (#16)"],[1," as heretical: for it was altogether incompatible with  the high pretensions of the Church of Rome. It was a doctrine unknown  to the founders of the Church of England. The Homily on Wilful Rebellion  had strongly, and indeed too strongly, inculcated submission to  constituted authority, but had made no distinction between hereditary  end elective monarchies, or between monarchies and republics. Indeed  most of the predecessors of James would, from personal motives, have  regarded the patriarchal theory of government with aversion. William  Rufus, Henry the First, Stephen, John, Henry the Fourth, Henry the  Fifth, Henry the Sixth, Richard the Third, and Henry the Seventh, had  all reigned in defiance of the strict rule of descent. A grave  doubt hung over the legitimacy both of Mary and of Elizabeth. It was  impossible that both Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn could have been  lawfully married to Henry the Eighth; and the highest authority in  the realm had pronounced that neither was so. The Tudors, far from  considering the law of succession as a divine and unchangeable  institution, were constantly tampering with it. Henry the Eighth  obtained an act of parliament, giving him power to leave the crown by  will, and actually made a will to the prejudice of the royal family  of Scotland. Edward the Sixth, unauthorised by Parliament, assumed a  similar power, with the full approbation of the most eminent Reformers.  Elizabeth, conscious that her own title was open to grave objection, and  unwilling to admit even a reversionary right in her rival and enemy  the Queen of Scots, induced the Parliament to pass a law, enacting that  whoever should deny the competency of the reigning sovereign, with the  assent of the Estates of the realm, to alter the succession, should  suffer death as a traitor: But the situation of James was widely  different from that of Elizabeth. Far inferior to her in abilities and  in popularity, regarded by the English as an alien, and excluded from  the throne by the testament of Henry the Eighth, the King of Scots was  yet the undoubted heir of William the Conqueror and of Egbert. He had,  therefore, an obvious interest in inculcating the superstitions notion  that birth confers rights anterior to law, and unalterable by law. It  was a notion, moreover, well suited to his intellect and temper. It soon  found many advocates among those who aspired to his favour, and made  rapid progress among the clergy of the Established Church.    Thus, at the very moment at which a republican spirit began to manifest  itself strongly in the Parliament and in the country, the claims of the  monarch took a monstrous form which would have disgusted the proudest  and most arbitrary of those who had preceded him on the throne.    James was always boasting of his skill in what he called kingcraft; and  yet it is hardly possible even to imagine a course more directly opposed  to all the rules of kingcraft, than that which he followed. The policy  of wise rulers has always been to disguise strong acts under popular  forms. It was thus that Augustus and Napoleon established absolute  monarchies, while the public regarded them merely as eminent citizens  invested with temporary magistracies. The policy of James was the direct  reverse of theirs. He enraged and alarmed his Parliament by constantly  telling them that they held their privileges merely during his pleasure  and that they had no more business to inquire what he might lawfully  do than what the Deity might lawfully do. Yet he quailed before them,  abandoned minister after minister to their vengeance, and suffered them  to tease him into acts directly opposed to his strongest inclinations.  Thus the indignation excited by his claims and the scorn excited by  his concessions went on growing together. By his fondness for worthless  minions, and by the sanction which he gave to their tyranny and  rapacity, he kept discontent constantly alive. His cowardice, his  childishness, his pedantry, his ungainly person, his provincial accent,  made him an object of derision. Even in his virtues and accomplishments  there was something eminently unkingly. Throughout the whole course of  his reign, all the venerable associations by which the throng had long  been fenced were gradually losing their strength. During two hundred  years all the sovereigns who had ruled England, with the exception of  Henry the Sixth, had been strongminded, highspirited, courageous, and of  princely bearing. Almost all had possessed abilities above the ordinary  level. It was no light thing that on the very eve of the decisive  struggle between our Kings and their Parliaments, royalty should be  exhibited to the world stammering, slobbering, shedding unmanly tears,  trembling at a drawn sword, and talking in the style alternately of a  buffoon and of a pedagogue.    In the meantime the religious dissensions, by which, from the days of  Edward the Sixth, the Protestant body had been distracted, had become  more formidable than ever. The interval which had separated the first  generation of Puritans from Cranmer and Jewel was small indeed when  compared with the interval which separated the third generation of  Puritans from Laud and Hammond. While the recollection of Mary's  cruelties was still fresh, while the powers of the Roman Catholic party  still inspired apprehension, while Spain still retained ascendency and  aspired to universal dominion, all the reformed sects knew that they had  a strong common interest and a deadly common enemy. The animosity  which they felt towards each other was languid when compared with  the animosity which they all felt towards Rome. Conformists and  Nonconformists had heartily joined in enacting penal laws of extreme  severity against the Papists. But when more than half a century of  undisturbed possession had given confidence to the Established Church,  when nine tenths of the nation had become heartily Protestant, when  England was at peace with all the world, when there was no danger that  Popery would be forced by foreign arms on the nation, when the last  confessors who had stood before Bonner had passed away, a change took  place in the feeling of the Anglican clergy. Their hostility to the  Roman Catholic doctrine and discipline was considerably mitigated.  Their dislike of the Puritans, on the other hand, increased daily. The  controversies which had from the beginning divided the Protestant party  took such a form as made reconciliation hopeless; and new controversies  of still greater importance were added to the old subjects of dispute.    The founders of the Anglican Church had retained episcopacy as an  ancient, a decent, and a convenient ecclesiastical polity, but had not  declared that form of church government to be of divine institution. We  have already seen how low an estimate Cranmer had formed of the office  of a Bishop. In the reign of Elizabeth, Jewel, Cooper, Whitgift, and  other eminent doctors defended prelacy, as innocent, as useful, as what  the state might lawfully establish, as what, when established by the  state, was entitled to the respect of every citizen. But they never  denied that a Christian community without a Bishop might be a pure  Church. [6] On the contrary, they regarded the Protestants of the  Continent as of the same household of faith with themselves. Englishmen  in England were indeed bound to acknowledge the authority of the Bishop,  as they were bound to acknowledge the authority of the Sheriff and of  the Coroner: but the obligation was purely local. An English churchman,  nay even an English prelate, if he went to Holland, conformed without  scruple to the established religion of Holland. Abroad the ambassadors  of Elizabeth and James went in state to the very worship which Elizabeth  and James persecuted at home, and carefully abstained from decorating  their private chapels after the Anglican fashion, lest scandal should  be given to weaker brethren. An instrument is still extant by which the  Primate of all England, in the year 1582, authorised a Scotch minister,  ordained, according to the laudable forms of the Scotch Church, by the  Synod of East Lothian, to preach and administer the sacraments in  any part of the province of Canterbury. [7] In the year 1603, the  Convocation solemnly recognised the Church of Scotland, a Church in  which episcopal control and episcopal ordination were then unknown, as a  branch of the Holy Catholic Church of Christ. [8] It was even held that  Presbyterian ministers were entitled to place and voice in oecumenical  councils. When the States General of the United Provinces convoked at  Dort a synod of doctors not episcopally ordained, an English Bishop and  an English Dean, commissioned by the head of the English Church, sate  with those doctors, preached to them, and voted with them on the gravest  questions of theology. [9] Nay, many English benefices were held by  divines who had been admitted to the ministry in the Calvinistic form  used on the Continent; nor was reordination by a Bishop in such cases  then thought necessary, or even lawful. [10]    But a new race of divines was already rising in the Church of England.  In their view the episcopal office was essential to the welfare of a  Christian society and to the efficacy of the most solemn ordinances of  religion. To that office belonged certain high and sacred privileges,  which no human power could give or take away. A church might as well be  without the doctrine of the Trinity, or the doctrine of the Incarnation,  as without the apostolical orders; and the Church of Rome, which, in the  midst of all her corruptions, had retained the apostolical orders,  was nearer to primitive purity than those reformed societies which had  rashly set up, in opposition to the divine model, a system invented by  men.    In the days of Edward the Sixth and of Elizabeth, the defenders of the  Anglican ritual had"]]]
