(Leccion decima octava.)                                TRANSITIVE VERBS.      A verb is Transitive when its action passes from the subject of the  action to the object.    =Transitive Verbs= are divided into--    =1. Active= (when the subject of the verb stands for the doer or agent  of the action), as--    Renovamos nuestros ofrecimientos de servicios: We renew our offers of  services.    =2. Passive= (when the subject of the verb stands for the real object of  the action, viz., when it suffers the action instead of doing it), as--    Los ofrecimientos de sus servicios nos fueron renovados en su ultimo  escrito: His offers of services were renewed to us in his last letter.    The Passive voice in Spanish is formed with the verb _ser_ as above, or  by using the =active voice= with the pronoun _se_, as--    Se nos renovaron los ofrecimientos de sus servicios: His offers, etc.    Active verbs become reflexive when their subject and object are the same  person or thing, as--    Nos lisonjeamos poderlos servir por lo mejor de sus intereses: We  flatter ourselves that we can serve them to the best of their interests.      Reflexive verbs in the plural are also reciprocal, as--    Nos comprendemos: We understand each other.    Nos escribimos muy frecuentemente: We write to each other very  frequently.    \"Uno a otro\" and \"los unos a los otros\" may be added for greater  clearness, as--    Procuramos convencernos (a nosotros mismos). We try to convince  ourselves (each other).    Procuramos convencernos (el uno al otro). We try to convince ourselves  (each other).    The direct object of a transitive verb,[121] if a proper name of a  person or place, must be preceded by _a_, as--    Vimos al Senor Guillermo: We saw Mr. William.  Visitamos a Francia[122]: We visited France.    [Footnote 121: With the exception of \"Tener.\"]    [Footnote 122: But not geographical names preceded by the article, as:  Avistamos La Habana (we sighted Havana).]      A is also generally used before any noun =indicating= a person,[123]  as--    Empleamos a este corresponsal: We employ this correspondent.    [Footnote 123: This part of the rule is not very strict, as we find it  sometimes omitted before persons, and at others used before names of  things, as: El hecho precedio a la palabra (the action preceded the  word).]      But _a_ should be avoided whenever it would engender confusion, or when  the verb governs an accusative and a dative at the same time, as--    Enviamos nuestro dependiente: We send our clerk.    Recomendamos el Sr. Perez a nuestro fabricante: We recommend Mr. Perez  to our manufacturer.    A is also omitted when the noun following it does not refer to a  particular individual, but to =any= individual of a certain class, as--    Busco criado: I am looking for a servant.    Juan no quiere socios en su empresa: John does not want any partners in  his undertaking.      Verbs whose root ends in _ll_ or _n_ take =e= and =o= instead of _ie_  and _io_, as--    +------------------------------+-------------------------------+  |         =Bullir= (to boil).  |  =Grunir= (to growl, grumble).|  +------------------------------+-------------------------------+  |_Pres. Part._, Bullendo       |Grunendo                       |  |_Past Def._    Bullo, bulleron|Gruno, gruneron[124]           |  +------------------------------+-------------------------------+    [Footnote 124: The Imperf. and Fut.

He was sorry he did it.    Of a sudden there was a roar, such a roar that the very ground shook,  and as to the poor merchant he quivered like a leaf.    Enough to make him quiver indeed, for a gate in the wall suddenly  opened, and out rushed the _Beast_.    Yes, the Beast, if you please, and he seized the merchant by the  scruff of his neck, and dragged him into the Park, and shut the gate  after him.    \"Don't you know it's a sin to steal?\" roared the Beast. \"How dare you  steal my roses? I am going to kill you.\"    \"Oh, mercy, Mr. Beast,\" cried the unhappy man, flinging himself on his  knees before the monster.    [Illustration]    \"I'm going to kill you,\" roared the Beast still more loudly. \"It's  taken years to cultivate this sort of rose, and--and I'm going to  kill you. Unless,\" he added after a pause, \"you send me one of your  daughters here instead.\"    \"All right,\" said the merchant and got on his feet again.    \"She must be here to-morrow by breakfast time, and I breakfast early,\"  said the Beast, as he let the merchant out of the gate. \"If she is not  here, I shall come for you, and don't you forget it.\"    It was by no means likely that he would forget it, in fact he could  think of nothing else. He hurried home and told his dreadful news, and  received a dreadful scolding from his two elder daughters, who were  angry at not getting their presents.    \"And it is Beauty's fault that you have got into this trouble,\" they  said. \"Beauty and her stupid rose. Beauty had better get you out of  the trouble.\" Beauty said little, but smiled on, with sunshine in her  heart, and trust in her loving nature, and cooked the dinner.    [Illustration: \"WHEN SHE CAME TO THE GATE IN THE WALL SHE KNOCKED UPON  IT THREE TIMES\"]    Early next morning when the dawn was breaking she left her father's  house, leaving a little note behind her begging him not to be anxious  but that she had gone to the Beast's castle.    When she came to the gate in the wall she knocked upon it three  times and it opened as if by magic, for she could see no one. And she  stepped into the garden of red roses, and in the distance across the  Park she saw the Castle, and she thought she had never seen anything  so beautiful. For it was built of mother-of-pearl, and the red and  yellow gleams of the rising sun shone upon its glistening walls, and  lit them up with a thousand radiant lights.    Beauty marvelled at the loveliness and walked on. And when she arrived  at this beautiful Castle, the huge gates opened as if by magic, and  the doors opened as if by magic, for never a soul did she see, nor  living thing of any sort.    And in the great hall was the breakfast table laid for two. It was  a nice breakfast with steaming hot dishes, and jams, honey, and hot  rolls, and brightly polished silver, and sweet flowers.    Then the Beast appeared suddenly from behind a curtain; oh, he was  an awful Beast, and Beauty's heart beat fast! But he seemed a polite  Beast for all that.    He handed Beauty a chair, and when she had sat down said:    \"I bid you welcome; which do you take, tea or coffee?\"    \"Tea please,\" answered Beauty.    \"Then pour it out,\" he said, \"and I'll take tea too, please. Eggs, do  you like eggs hard or soft?\"    \"I always cook mine three minutes and a half,\" replied Beauty.    \"Half a minute too much, I think. But you shall have just what you  like.\"    And so she had; not only at the breakfast table but in everything. She  had only to express a wish and it was immediately gratified. She  had ponies to ride, and dogs and cats, and pet birds, and the most  beautiful dresses ever worn by real princesses.    And if it had not been that she was away from her father she would  really have been happy.    [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST]    The Beast was most kind and attentive to her, and told her that he  loved her, and three times a day he asked her to marry him, but Beauty  shook her head and said, oh no, she couldn't.    Well, Beauty had been at the great Castle some time when she began to  pine to go home and see her father, and she begged the Beast to let  her go.    \"Very good,\" he said with a great sigh, \"you may go home to-day, but  promise me that you will be back early to-morrow morning. If you do  not come back early I am sure I shall die for I love you so dearly.\"    So Beauty promised and went home, and she took presents for her father  and her sisters, and when the sisters heard of all the wonderful  things at the great Castle, they were envious and jealous, and made up  their minds to do Beauty and the Beast a great injury.    So they mixed something in Beauty's supper that made her sleep nearly  all the next day, and so she did not keep her promise. It was evening  when she arrived at the gate in the wall, instead of early morning.    But she knocked three times and the gate opened by magic, and she went  through the garden and hurried to the Castle, that shone like fire in  the light of the setting sun. And the huge gates opened by magic, and  the doors opened by magic, and she stood in the great hall, but there  was no Beast there. She searched in all the rooms but he was not  there; with fear and anxiety in her heart she ran into the gardens,  and there she found him at last. Found him lying stretched out on the  grass, and she thought he was dead.    \"Oh, dear darling Beast,\" she cried, as she threw herself on her knees  beside him, and raised his ugly head, \"dear Beast, do not die, for  I love you with all my heart, and will marry you to-morrow.\" And she  kissed him. Then of a sudden he sprang to his feet, but no longer  the Beast, no longer a hideous monster, but a beautiful prince most  beautifully dressed. \"Dearest,\" he said, \"a wicked fairy turned me  into this brute form until a day should come when a good girl like you  should tell me that she loved me. And you will marry me to-morrow.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" answered Beauty, \"but the wicked fairy could not change  your nature. I would have married you if you had remained just as you  were.\"    [Illustration]    And so they married and lived happy ever afterwards, and they took  care of Beauty's father until the end of his days; so he was happy,  and they forgave the two sisters and gave them fine dresses and  jewels, and the two sisters turned over a new leaf and were less  selfish, and they were happy, so this is a very happy ending to the  story.    What a pity all stories can't end the same way!          [Illustration]    TUFTY RIQUET      There was once upon a time a Queen who had the ugliest little baby  imaginable, so ugly, indeed, that it was almost impossible to believe  he was a little boy at all.    A fairy, however, assured his mother that the little baby would be  very good and clever, saying that she was also giving him a gift which  would enable him to make that person whom he loved the best as clever  as himself.    This somewhat consoled the Queen, but still she was very unhappy  because her son was so ugly, though no sooner had he begun to speak  than he could talk about all sorts of things, and he had such pretty  ways that people were charmed with him.    I forgot to say, that, when he was quite a baby, he had a funny little  tuft of hair on his head, so he was called Tufty Riquet, for Riquet  was the family name.    When Riquet was about seven years old, the Queen of a kingdom near by  was given two baby daughters, twins, of which one was so exquisitely  beautiful that the Queen nearly died of joy when she saw her, and so  the fairy, the same one who had given Riquet his gift of cleverness,  to keep the Queen from making herself ill with excitement, told her  that this little Princess would not be at all clever, indeed she would  be as stupid as she was beautiful.    [Illustration]    The Queen was very much grieved at this, and felt still more troubled  when she beheld her other daughter, for the second Princess was  extremely ugly.    \"Do not take it too much to heart, madam,\" remarked the fairy, \"for  this second daughter will be so clever that it will scarcely be  noticed that she is not beautiful.\"    \"Well, if it must be so, it must,\" remarked the Queen, \"but I should  certainly have liked the elder one, who is beautiful, to be just a  little bit clever too.\"    \"I can do nothing as to her mind, madam,\" replied the fairy, \"but for  her beauty I can, and as there is nothing I would not do to please  you, I will give her a gift so that she can make the one who wins her  heart beautiful too.\"    As the Princesses grew up, their gifts likewise grew with them, so  that everybody spoke about the beauty of the one and the cleverness  of the other; but also their defects grew, so that it could not but  be noticed that the younger was daily uglier, and the elder day by  day became more stupid, until she either said nothing in reply to a  question, or something quite silly, and so clumsy was she that she  could not arrange four china ornaments on the chimney piece without  breaking one, or drink a glass of water without spilling half of it on  her frock.    Although it is a great thing to have beauty, yet the younger generally  received more attention in company than her elder sister.    At first, everybody would gather around the beautiful one admiringly,  but before long they would leave her for the clever Princess, to  listen to her pleasant conversation; and by the end of a quarter of  an hour the elder would be"]]]
