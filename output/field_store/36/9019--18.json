Parties of people were every where heard and  seen variously employed; some in clearing ground for the different  encampments; others in pitching tents, or bringing up such stores as were  more immediately wanted; and the spot which had so lately been the abode  of silence and tranquillity was now changed to that of noise, clamour,  and confusion: but after a time order gradually prevailed every where. As  the woods were opened and the ground cleared, the various encampments  were extended, and all wore the appearance of regularity.    February.] A portable canvas house, brought over for the governor, was  erected on the East side of the cove (which was named Sydney, in  compliment to the principal secretary of state for the home department)  where also a small body of convicts was put under tents. The detachment  of marines was encamped at the head of the cove near the stream, and on  the West side was placed the main body of the convicts. The women did not  disembark until the 6th of February; when, every person belonging to the  settlement being landed, the numbers amounted to 1030 persons. The tents  for the sick were placed on the West side, and it was observed with  concern that their numbers were fast increasing. The scurvy, that had not  appeared during the passage, now broke out, which, aided by a dysentery,  began to fill the hospital, and several died. In addition to the  medicines that were administered, every species of esculent plants that  could be found in the country were procured for them; wild celery,  spinach, and parsley, fortunately grew in abundance about the settlement;  those who were in health, as well as the sick, were very glad to  introduce them into their messes, and found them a pleasant as well as  wholesome addition to the ration of salt provisions.    The public stock, consisting of one bull, four cows, one bull-calf, one  stallion, three mares, and three colts (one of which was a stone-colt)  were landed on the East point of the cove, where they remained until they  had cropped the little pasturage it afforded; and were then removed to a  spot at the head of the adjoining cove, that was cleared for a small  farm, intended to be placed under the direction of a person brought out  by the governor.    Some ground having been prepared near his excellency's house on the East  side, the plants from Rio-de-Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope were  safely brought on shore in a few days; and we soon had the satisfaction  of seeing the grape, the fig, the orange, the pear, and the apple, the  delicious fruits of the Old, taking root and establishing themselves in  our New World.    As soon as the hurry and tumult necessarily attending the disembarkation  had a little subsided, the governor caused his Majesty's commission,  appointing him to be his captain-general and governor in chief in and  over the territory of New South Wales and its dependencies, to be  publicly read, together with the letters patent for establishing the  courts of civil and criminal judicature in the territory, the extent of  which, until this publication of it, was but little known even among  ourselves. It was now found to extend from Cape York (the extremity of  the coast to the northward) in the latitude of 20 degrees 37 minutes  South, to the South Cape (the southern extremity of the coast) in the  latitude of 43 degrees 39 minutes South; and inland to the westward as  far as 135 degrees of East longitude, comprehending all the islands  adjacent in the Pacific Ocean, within the latitudes of the  above-mentioned capes.    By this definition of our boundaries it will be seen that we were  confined along the coast of this continent to such parts of it solely as  were navigated by Captain Cook, without infringing on what might be  claimed by other nations from the right of discovery. Of that right,  however, no other nation has chosen to avail itself. Whether the western  coast is unpromising in its appearance, or whether the want of a return  proportioned to the expense which the mother-country must sustain in  supporting a settlement formed nearly at the farthest part of the globe,  may have deterred them, is not known; but Great Britain alone has  followed up the discoveries she had made in this country, by at once  establishing in it a regular colony and civil government.    The ceremony of reading these public instruments having been performed by  the judge-advocate, the governor, addressing himself to the convicts,  assured them, among other things, that 'he should ever be ready to show  approbation and encouragement to those who proved themselves worthy of  them by good conduct and attention to orders; while on the other hand,  such as were determined to act in opposition to propriety, and observe a  contrary conduct, would inevitably meet with the punishment which they  deserved.' He remarked how much it was their interest to forget the  habits of vice and indolence in which too many of them had hitherto  lived; and exhorted them to be honest among themselves, obedient to their  overseers, and attentive to the several works in which they were about to  be employed. At the conclusion of this address three volleys were fired  by the troops, who thereupon returned to their parade, where the  governor, attended by Captain Hunter and the principal officers of the  settlement, passed along the front of the detachment, and received the  honours due to a captain-general; after which he entertained all the  officers and gentlemen of the settlement at dinner, under a large tent  pitched for the purpose at the head of the marine encampment.    The convicts had been mustered early in the morning, when nine were  reported to be absent. From the situation which we had unavoidably  adopted, it was impossible to prevent these people from straggling.  Fearless of the danger which must attend them, many had visited the  French ships in Botany Bay, soliciting to be taken on board, and giving a  great deal of trouble. It was soon found that they secreted at least  one-third of their working tools, and that any sort of labour was with  difficulty procured from them.    The want of proper overseers principally contributed to this. Those who  were placed over them as such were people selected from among themselves,  being recommended by their conduct during the voyage; few of these,  however, chose to exert the authority that was requisite to keep the  gangs at their labour, although assured of meeting with every necessary  support. Petty thefts among themselves began soon to be complained of;  the sailors from the transports, although repeatedly forbidden, and  frequently punished, still persisted in bringing spirits on shore by  night, and drunkenness was often the consequence.    To check these enormities, the court of criminal judicature was assembled  on the 11th of February, when three prisoners were tried; one for an  assault, of which being found guilty, he was sentenced to receive one  hundred and fifty lashes; a second, for taking some biscuit from another  convict, was sentenced to a week's confinement on bread and water, on a  small rocky island near the entrance of the cove; and a third, for  stealing a plank, was sentenced to receive fifty lashes, but, being  recommended to the governor, was forgiven.    The mildness of these punishments seemed rather to have encouraged than  deterred others from the commission of greater offences; for before the  month was ended the criminal court was again assembled for the trial of  four offenders, who had conceived and executed a plan for robbing the  public store during the time of issuing the provisions. This crime, in  its tendency big with evil to our little community, was rendered still  more atrocious by being perpetrated at the very time when the difference  of provisions, which had till then existed, was taken off, and the  convict saw the same proportion of provision issued to himself that was  served to the soldier and the officer, the article of spirits only  excepted. Each male convict was that day put upon the following weekly  ration of provisions, two-thirds of which was served to the female  convicts, viz 7 pounds of biscuit; 1 pound of flour; 7 pounds of beef, or  4 pounds of pork; 3 pints of peas; and 6 ounces of butter.    It was fair to suppose that so liberal a ration would in itself have  proved the security of the store, and have defended it from depredation;  but we saw with concern, that there were among us some minds so  habitually vicious that no consideration was of any weight with them, nor  could they be induced to do right by any prospect of future benefit, or  fear of certain and immediate punishment. The charge being fully proved,  one man, James Barrett, suffered death: his confederates were pardoned,  on condition of their being banished from the settlement. Another culprit  was sentenced to receive three hundred lashes; but, not appearing so  guilty as his companions, was pardoned by the governor, the power of  pardoning being vested in him by his Majesty's commission.    His excellency, having caused one example to be made, extended lenity to  some others who were tried the following day; and one convict, James  Freeman, was pardoned on condition of his becoming the public  executioner.    It appeared by the letters patent under the great seal of Great Britain,  which were read after the governor's commission, that 'the appointment of  the place to which offenders should be transported having been vested in  the crown by an act of parliament, his Majesty, by two several orders in  council, bearing date the 6th of December 1786, had declared, that  certain offenders named in two lists annexed to the orders in council  should be transported to the eastern coast of New Holland, named New  South Wales, or some one or other of the islands adjacent:' and it being  deemed necessary that a colony and civil government should be established "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#16)"],[1,"of all she went to old Farmer Rodel, and in plain words asked him  to let her have at once the legacy that he had promised her long ago.    The old man replied:    \"Why do you press it so? Can't you wait? What's the matter with you?\"    \"Nothing's the matter with me, but I can't wait.\"    Then she told him that she was fitting out her brother who was going to  emigrate to America. This was a good chance for old Rodel; he could now  give his natural hardness the appearance of benevolence and prudent  forethought. Accordingly he declared to Barefoot that he would not give  her one farthing now, for he did not want to be responsible for her  ruining herself for that brother of hers.    Barefoot then begged him to be her advocate with Scheckennarre. At last  he was induced to consent to this; and he took great credit to himself  for thus consenting to go begging to a man he did not know on behalf of  a stranger. He kept postponing the fulfilment of his promise from day to  day, but Barefoot did not cease from reminding him of it; and so, at  last, he set forth.    But, as might have been anticipated, he came back empty-handed; for the  first thing Scheckennarre did was to ask how much Farmer Rodel himself  was going to give, and when he heard that Rodel, for the present, was  not going to give anything, his course, too, was clear and he followed  it.    When Barefoot told Black Marianne how hurt she felt at this  hard-heartedness, the old woman said:    \"Yes, that's just how people are! If a man were to jump into the water  tomorrow and be taken out dead, they would all say: 'If he had only told  me what was amiss with him, I should have been very glad to help him in  every way and to have given him something. What would I not give now, if  I could restore him to life!' But to keep a man alive, they won't stir a  finger.\"    Strangely enough, the very fact that the whole weight of things always  fell upon Barefoot made her bear it all more easily. \"Yes, one must  always depend upon oneself alone,\" was her secret motto; and instead of  letting obstacles discourage her, she only strove harder to surmount  them. She scraped together and turned into money whatever of her  possessions she could lay hands on; even the valuable necklace she had  received in the old days from Farmer Landfried's wife went its way to  the widow of the old sexton, a worthy woman who supported herself in her  widowhood by lending money at high interest on security; the ducat, too,  which she had once thrown after Severin in the churchyard, was brought  into requisition. And, marvelous to relate, old Farmer Rodel offered to  obtain a considerable contribution from the Village Council, of which he  was a member; he was fond of doing virtuous and benevolent things with  the public money!    Still it almost frightened Barefoot when he announced to her, after a  few days, that everything had been granted--but upon the one condition,  that Damie should entirely give up his right to live in the village. Of  course, that had been understood from the first--no one had expected  anything else; but still, now that it was an express condition, it  seemed like a very formidable matter to have no home anywhere. Barefoot  said nothing about this thought to Damie, who seemed cheerful and of  good courage. Black Marianne, especially, continued to urge him strongly  to go; for she would have been glad to send the whole village away to  foreign parts, if only she could at last get tidings of her John. And  now she had firmly taken up the notion that he had sailed across the  seas. Crappy Zachy had indeed told her, that the reason she could not  cry any more was because the ocean, the great salty deep, absorbed the  tears which one might be disposed to shed for one who was on the other  shore.    Barefoot received permission from her employers to accompany her brother  when he went to town to conclude the arrangement for his passage with  the agent. Greatly were both of them astonished when they learned, on  arriving at the office, that this had already been done. The Village  Council had already taken the necessary steps, and Damie was to have his  rights and corresponding obligations as one of the village poor. On  board the ship, before it sailed out into the wide ocean, he would have  to sign a paper, attesting his embarkation, and not until then would the  money be paid.    The brother and sister returned sorrowfully to the village. Damie had  been seized with a fit of his old despondency, because a thing had now  to be carried out which he himself had wished. And Barefoot herself felt  deeply grieved at the thought that her brother was, in a way, to be  expelled from his native land. At the boundary-line Damie said aloud to  the sign-post, on which the name of the village and of the district were  painted:    \"You there! I don't belong to you any longer, and all the people who  live here are no more to me than you are.\"    Barefoot started to cry; but she resolved within herself that this  should be the last time until her brother's departure, and until he was  fairly gone. And she kept her word to herself.    The people in the village said that Barefoot had no heart, because her  eyes were not wet when her brother went away. People like to see tears  actually shed--for what do they care about those that are shed in  secret? But Barefoot was calm and brave.    Only during the last days before Damie set out did she for the first  time fail in her duty; for she neglected her work by being with Damie  all the time. She let Rose upbraid her for it, and merely said: \"You are  right.\" But still she ran after her brother everywhere--she did not want  to lose a minute of his company as long as he was there. She very likely  felt that she might be able to do something special for him at any  moment, or say something special that would be of use to him all his  life; and she was vexed with herself for finding nothing but quite  ordinary things to say, and for even quarreling with him sometimes.    Oh, these hours of parting! How they oppress the heart! How all the past  and all the future seem crowded together into one moment, and one knows  not how to set about anything rightly, and only a look or a touch must  tell all that is felt!    Still Amrei found good words to speak. When she counted out her  brother's stock of linen she said:    \"These are good, respectable shirts--keep yourself respectable and good  in them.\"    And when she packed everything into the big sack, on which her father's  name was still to be seen, she said:    \"Bring this back full of glittering gold; then you shall see how glad  they will be to give you back the right to live here. And Farmer Rodel's  Rose, if she's still unmarried, will jump over seven houses to get you.\"    And when she laid their father's ax in the large chest, she said:    \"How smooth the handle is! How often it has slipped through our father's  hand. I fancy I can still feel his touch upon it! So now I have a motto  for you--'Sack and Ax.' Working and gathering in, those are the best  things in life--they make one keep cheerful and well and happy. God keep  you! And say to yourself very often--'Sack and Ax.' I shall do the same,  and that shall be our motto, our remembrance, our call to each other  when we are far, far apart, and until you write to me, or come to fetch  me, or do what you can, as God shall will it. 'Sack and Ax'--yes it's  all included in that; so one can treasure up everything--all thoughts  and all that one has earned!\"    And when Damie was sitting up in the wagon, and for the last time gave  her his hand, for a long time she would not release it. And when at last  he drove away, she called out after him with a loud voice:    \"'Sack and Ax'--don't forget that!\"    He looked back, waved his hand to her, and then--he was gone.    [Illustration: HE GAVE HER HIS HAND FOR THE LAST TIME]          CHAPTER IX    AN UNINVITED GUEST      \"Glory to America!\" the village watchman, to the amusement of all, cried  several nights when he called out the hours, in place of the usual  thanksgiving to God. Crappy Zachy, being a man of no consideration  himself, was fond of speaking evil of the poor when he found himself  among what he called \"respectable people,\" and on Sunday when he came  out of church, or on an afternoon when he sat on the long bench outside  the \"Heathcock,\" he would say:    \"Columbus was a real benefactor. From what did he not deliver us? Yes,  America is the pig-trough of the Old World, and into it everything that  can't be used in the kitchen is dumped--cabbage and turnips and all  sorts of things. And for the piggies who live in the castle behind the  house, and understand French--'Oui! Oui!'--there's very good feeding  there.\"    In the general dearth of interesting subjects, Damie and his emigrating  naturally formed the main topic of conversation for a considerable time,  and the members of the Council praised their own wisdom in having rid  the place of a person who would certainly have come to be a burden on  the community. For a man who goes driving about from one trade to  another is sure to drive himself into ruin eventually.    Of course, there were plenty of good-natured people who reported to  Barefoot all that was said of her brother, and told her how he was made  a laughing-stock. But Barefoot merely smiled. When Damie's first letter  came from Bremen--nobody had ever thought that he could write so  properly--then she exulted before the eyes of men, and read the letter  aloud several times; but in secret she was sorry to have lost such a  brother, probably forever. She reproached herself for not having put him  forward enough, for it was now evident what a sharp lad Damie was, and  so good too! He wanted to take leave of the whole village as he had  taken leave of the post at the boundary-line, and he now filled almost a  whole page with remembrances to different people,"]]]
