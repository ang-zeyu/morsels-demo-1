Sometimes  the exterior coating of grass is not very coarse; at other times  bamboo-spathes exclusively are used, and the nest seems to be  completely packed up in these.    The eggs of this species are broad ovals, pure white and glossy. They  vary from 1.05 to 1.13 in length, and from 0.86 to 0.95 in width, but  the average of eighteen eggs is a little over 1.1 by 0.9.      70.

Mr. Oates, who found the nest of this bird many years ago in Burma,  has the following note:--\"Nest in a bush a few feet from the ground,  on the 8th June, near Pegu. In shape hemispherical, the foundation  being of small branches and leaves of the bamboo, and the interior  and sides of small branches of the coarser weeds and fine twigs. The  latter form the egg-chamber lining and are nicely curved. Exterior and  interior diameters respectively 7 and 31/2 inches. Total depth 31/2 and  interior depth 2 inches. Three eggs, pure white and highly glossy, and  they measure 1.14 by .87, 1.1 by .88, and 1.03 by .86.\"    The nests of this species are large, loosely constructed cups, much  resembling those of its Himalayan congeners. The base and sides  consist chiefly of dry bamboo-leaves with a few dead tree-leaves  scantily held together by a few creepers, while the interior portion  of the nest, which has no separate lining, is composed of fine twigs  and stems of herbaceous plants and the slender flower-stems of trees  which bear their flowers in clusters. The nests vary a good deal in  exterior dimensions as the materials straggle far and wide in some  cases, and the external diameter may be said to vary from 6 to 8  inches, and the height from 3.25 to 4.5; the cavities are more uniform  in size, and are about 3.5 in diameter by 2 in depth.    The eggs are moderately broad ovals, at times somewhat pointed perhaps  towards the small end, pure white and fairly glossy.    Major C.T. Bingham thus writes of this bird:--\"It is very difficult  to either watch these birds, unseen yourself, at one of their dancing  parties, or to catch one of them actually sitting on the nest. Twice  had I in the end of March this year come across nests with one or two  of these birds in the vicinity, and yet have had to leave the eggs  in them as uncertain to what bird they belonged. At last, on the 2nd  April, I came in for a piece of luck. I was roaming about in the  vicinity of my camp on the Gawbechoung, the main source of the  Thoungyeen river, and moving very slowly and silently amid the dense  clumps of bamboo, when my ears were saluted by the hearty laughter of  a flock of these birds, evidently not far off. Very quietly I crept  up, and looking cautiously from behind a thick bamboo-clump, saw ten  or twelve of them going through a most intricate dance, flirting their  wings and tails, and every now and then bursting into a chorus of  shouts, joined in by a few others who were seated looking on from  neighbouring bushes. During one of the pauses of the applause, and  while the dancers were busy twining in and out, a single rather  squeaky 'bravo' came from a bamboo-bush right opposite to me. Looking  up I was astonished to see a nest in a fork of the bamboo, and on the  nest a _Garrulax_ who, probably too busy with her maternal duties to  watch the performance going on below her attentively, came in with  a solitary shout of approbation at an unseemly time. I watched the  performance a few minutes longer, and then frightened the old hen  on the nest. The terrific scare I caused by my sudden appearance is  beyond description. The dancers scattered with screeches, and the  old hen dropped fainting over the side of her nest with a feeble  remonstrance, and disappeared in the most mysterious way. After all  the nest contained only one egg, very glossy, white, and fresh. The  nest was better and stronger built, though very like that of _Garrulax  moniliger_, constructed of twigs, and finely lined with black  hair-like roots; it measured some 6 inches in diameter, the egg-cavity  about 11/2 inch deep. Subsequently I took three other nests, on the 4th  April and 23rd May. The first contained three, the two latter three  and four eggs respectively. A considerable number of eggs measure from  1.22 to 1.06 in length, and from .92 to .81 in breadth, and average  1.13 by 0.88.\"      72.

Mr. Oates tells us that he \"found the nest of the Black-gorgeted  Laughing-Thrush in the Pegu Hills, on the 27th April, containing  three fresh eggs; the bird was sitting. The nest was placed in a  bamboo-clump about 7 feet from the ground, made outwardly of dead  bamboo-leaves and coarse roots, lined with finer roots and a few  feathers; inside diameter 6 inches, depth 2 inches. Two eggs measured  1.04 by 0.83 and 0.86. Colour, a beautiful clear blue.\"    One of these eggs sent by Mr. Oates[A] seems rather small for the  bird. It is a very broad, slightly pyriform oval, of a uniform pale  greenish-blue tint, and very fairly glossy. It measures 1.05 by 0.87.    [Footnote A: I fear I may have made a mistake in identifying the  nest referred to. With this caution, however, I allow my note to  stand.--ED.]    This egg appears to me to be an abnormally small one. A nest sent me  from Sikhim, where it was found in July, contained much larger eggs,  and more in proportion to the size of the bird. The nest I refer to  was placed in a clump of bamboos about 5 feet from the ground. It was  a tolerably compact, moderately deep, saucer-shaped nest, between 6  and 7 inches in diameter, composed of dead bamboo-sheaths and leaves  bound together with creepers and herbaceous stems, and thinly lined  with roots. It contained two eggs. These are rather broad ovals,  somewhat pointed towards one end, of a uniform pale greenish blue, and  are fairly glossy.    These eggs measured 1.33 and 1.30 in length, and 0.98 in breadth.    Mr. Mandelli sent me two nests of this species, both taken in Native  Sikhim, the one on the 4th, the other on the 20th July. Each contained  two fresh eggs. One was placed in a small tree in heavy jungle, at  a height of about 6 feet from the ground, the other in a clump of  bamboos a, foot lower. Both are large, coarse, saucer-shaped nests,  7 to 8 inches in diameter, and 3.5 to 4 in height externally; the  cavities are about 4.5 inches in diameter, and less than 2 in depth;  the basal portion of the nests is composed entirely of dry leaves,  chiefly those of the bamboo, loosely held together by a few stems of  creepers; the sides of the nest are stems of creepers wound round and  round and loosely intertwined, and the cavity is lined with rather  coarse rootlets, and in one case with fine twigs.    73. Garrulax moniliger (Hodgs.). _The Necklaced Laughing-Thrush_.    Garrulax moniliger (_Hodgs.) Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 40; _Hume, Rough  Draft N. & E._ no. 413.    Of the Necklaced Laughing-Thrush Dr. Jerdon says:--\"I procured both  this and the last (the Black-gorgeted Laughing-Thrush) at Darjeeling,  and have also seen one or both in Sylhet, Cachar, and Upper Burmah.  They both associate in large flocks, and frequent more open forest  than most of the previous species. The eggs are greenish blue.\"    From Sikhim, Mr. Gammie writes:--\"In the first week of June I found a  nest in low jungle, at 2000 feet, containing four greenish-blue eggs,  but, as I did not see the bird, left it until my return a week later.  I then saw the female, but in the interval the young had been hatched.  The nest closely resembled that of _D. caerulatus_ [p. 46], both in  shape and composition, and was similarly situated between several  upright slender shoots to which it was firmly attached. It was,  however, within five feet of the ground, which is lower by 5 feet or  so than _D. caerulatus_ generally builds.    \"I have found this species breeding from April to June, up to  elevations not much exceeding 2500 feet. It affects the low, dense  scrub growing in moist situations, and usually fixes its nest between  several upright sprays, within 5 or 6 feet of the ground. The nest  is cup-shaped, made of dry bamboo-leaves, intermixed with a very few  pieces of climber-stems, and thickly lined with old leaf-stalks of  some pinnate-leaved tree. Externally it measures about 5.5 inches in  diameter by 4 in height; internally 3.5 by 2.75.    \"The eggs are four or five in number.\"    Mr. Oates writes:--\"On the 27th April I shot a female in the Pegu  Hills off her nest. This latter contained one young one, and one  deformed egg, which unfortunately got broken; colour a deep blue.  The nest was placed in a small seedling bamboo about 6 feet from the  ground at a joint where a number of small twigs shot out, inverted  umbrella fashion. The nest in every respect closely resembled that of  _G. pectoralis_.\"    He subsequently remarked:--\"Breeds in Lower Pegu chiefly in July.  Average of six eggs, 1.16 by .88; colour, very glossy deep blue.  Nest placed in forks of saplings within reach of the hand, massive,  cup-shaped, and made of dead leaves and small branches; lined with  fine twigs. Outside diameter 7 inches and depth 4; interior 41/4 by 2.\"    A nest found below Darjeeling in the first week of June on the branch  of a good-sized tree, at a height of 12 feet from the ground, was  similar to that described by Mr. Gammie, and contained a single fresh  egg. This is a moderately broad oval, somewhat pointed towards the  small end, and exhibits very little gloss. It is of precisely the same  colour as those of the preceding species, but measures only 1.2 in  length by 0.9 in breadth."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1312"],[0,"Selected Stories of Bret Harte (#16)"],[1,"harbored with the logs at Utopia in the dreary distance.  But she noticed that day, when she went out to feed the chickens and  look after the cow, that the tide was up to the little fence of their  garden-patch, and the roar of the surf on the south beach, though miles  away, she could hear distinctly. And she began to think that she would  like to have someone to talk with about matters, and she believed that  if it had not been so far and so stormy, and the trail so impassable,  she would have taken the baby and have gone over to Ryckman's, her  nearest neighbor. But then, you see, he might have returned in the  storm, all wet, with no one to see to him; and it was a long exposure  for baby, who was croupy and ailing.    But that night, she never could tell why, she didn't feel like sleeping  or even lying down. The storm had somewhat abated, but she still \"sat  and sat,\" and even tried to read. I don't know whether it was a Bible or  some profane magazine that this poor woman read, but most probably the  latter, for the words all ran together and made such sad nonsense that  she was forced at last to put the book down and turn to that dearer  volume which lay before her in the cradle, with its white initial leaf  as yet unsoiled, and try to look forward to its mysterious future. And,  rocking the cradle, she thought of everything and everybody, but still  was wide-awake as ever.    It was nearly twelve o'clock when she at last lay down in her clothes.  How long she slept she could not remember, but she awoke with a dreadful  choking in her throat, and found herself standing, trembling all over,  in the middle of the room, with her baby clasped to her breast, and she  was \"saying something.\" The baby cried and sobbed, and she walked up  and down trying to hush it when she heard a scratching at the door. She  opened it fearfully, and was glad to see it was only old Pete, their  dog, who crawled, dripping with water, into the room. She would like to  have looked out, not in the faint hope of her husband's coming, but to  see how things looked; but the wind shook the door so savagely that she  could hardly hold it. Then she sat down a little while, and then walked  up and down a little while, and then she lay down again a little while.  Lying close by the wall of the little cabin, she thought she heard  once or twice something scrape slowly against the clapboards, like the  scraping of branches. Then there was a little gurgling sound, \"like the  baby made when it was swallowing\"; then something went \"click-click\"  and \"cluck-cluck,\" so that she sat up in bed. When she did so she was  attracted by something else that seemed creeping from the back door  toward the center of the room. It wasn't much wider than her little  finger, but soon it swelled to the width of her hand, and began  spreading all over the floor. It was water.    She ran to the front door and threw it wide open, and saw nothing but  water. She ran to the back door and threw it open, and saw nothing  but water. She ran to the side window, and throwing that open, she saw  nothing but water. Then she remembered hearing her husband once say that  there was no danger in the tide, for that fell regularly, and people  could calculate on it, and that he would rather live near the bay than  the river, whose banks might overflow at any time. But was it the tide?  So she ran again to the back door, and threw out a stick of wood. It  drifted away toward the bay. She scooped up some of the water and put it  eagerly to her lips. It was fresh and sweet. It was the river, and not  the tide!    It was then--O God be praised for his goodness! she did neither faint  nor fall; it was then--blessed be the Saviour, for it was his merciful  hand that touched and strengthened her in this awful moment--that fear  dropped from her like a garment, and her trembling ceased. It was then  and thereafter that she never lost her self-command, through all the  trials of that gloomy night.    She drew the bedstead toward the middle of the room, and placed a table  upon it and on that she put the cradle. The water on the floor  was already over her ankles, and the house once or twice moved so  perceptibly, and seemed to be racked so, that the closet doors all flew  open. Then she heard the same rasping and thumping against the wall,  and, looking out, saw that a large uprooted tree, which had lain near  the road at the upper end of the pasture, had floated down to the house.  Luckily its long roots dragged in the soil and kept it from moving as  rapidly as the current, for had it struck the house in its full career,  even the strong nails and bolts in the piles could not have withstood  the shock. The hound had leaped upon its knotty surface, and crouched  near the roots shivering and whining. A ray of hope flashed across her  mind. She drew a heavy blanket from the bed, and, wrapping it about  the babe, waded in the deepening waters to the door. As the tree swung  again, broadside on, making the little cabin creak and tremble, she  leaped on to its trunk. By God's mercy she succeeded in obtaining a  footing on its slippery surface, and, twining an arm about its roots,  she held in the other her moaning child. Then something cracked near the  front porch, and the whole front of the house she had just quitted fell  forward--just as cattle fall on their knees before they lie down--and at  the same moment the great redwood tree swung round and drifted away with  its living cargo into the black night.    For all the excitement and danger, for all her soothing of her crying  babe, for all the whistling of the wind, for all the uncertainty of  her situation, she still turned to look at the deserted and water-swept  cabin. She remembered even then, and she wonders how foolish she was to  think of it at that time, that she wished she had put on another dress  and the baby's best clothes; and she kept praying that the house would  be spared so that he, when he returned, would have something to come to,  and it wouldn't be quite so desolate, and--how could he ever know what  had become of her and baby? And at the thought she grew sick and faint.  But she had something else to do besides worrying, for whenever the  long roots of her ark struck an obstacle, the whole trunk made half a  revolution, and twice dipped her in the black water. The hound, who kept  distracting her by running up and down the tree and howling, at last  fell off at one of these collisions. He swam for some time beside her,  and she tried to get the poor beast up on the tree, but he \"acted silly\"  and wild, and at last she lost sight of him forever. Then she and her  baby were left alone. The light which had burned for a few minutes  in the deserted cabin was quenched suddenly. She could not then  tell whither she was drifting. The outline of the white dunes on the  peninsula showed dimly ahead, and she judged the tree was moving in a  line with the river. It must be about slack water, and she had  probably reached the eddy formed by the confluence of the tide and the  overflowing waters of the river. Unless the tide fell soon, there was  present danger of her drifting to its channel, and being carried out to  sea or crushed in the floating drift. That peril averted, if she were  carried out on the ebb toward the bay, she might hope to strike one  of the wooded promontories of the peninsula, and rest till daylight.  Sometimes she thought she heard voices and shouts from the river, and  the bellowing of cattle and bleating of sheep. Then again it was only  the ringing in her ears and throbbing of her heart. She found at about  this time that she was so chilled and stiffened in her cramped position  that she could scarcely move, and the baby cried so when she put it to  her breast that she noticed the milk refused to flow; and she was so  frightened at that, that she put her head under her shawl, and for the  first time cried bitterly.    When she raised her head again, the boom of the surf was behind her, and  she knew that her ark had again swung round. She dipped up the water to  cool her parched throat, and found that it was salt as her tears. There  was a relief, though, for by this sign she knew that she was drifting  with the tide. It was then the wind went down, and the great and awful  silence oppressed her. There was scarcely a ripple against the furrowed  sides of the great trunk on which she rested, and around her all was  black gloom and quiet. She spoke to the baby just to hear herself speak,  and to know that she had not lost her voice. She thought then--it was  queer, but she could not help thinking it--how awful must have been the  night when the great ship swung over the Asiatic peak, and the sounds of  creation were blotted out from the world. She thought, too, of mariners  clinging to spars, and of poor women who were lashed to rafts, and  beaten to death by the cruel sea. She tried to thank God that she was  thus spared, and lifted her eyes from the baby, who had fallen into a  fretful sleep. Suddenly, away to the southward, a great light lifted  itself out of the gloom, and flashed and flickered, and flickered and  flashed again. Her heart fluttered quickly against the baby's cold  cheek. It was the lighthouse at the entrance of the bay. As she was yet  wondering, the tree suddenly rolled a little, dragged a little, and  then seemed to lie quiet and still. She put out her hand and the current  gurgled against it. The tree was aground, and, by the position of the  light and the noise of the surf, aground upon the Dedlow Marsh.    Had it not been for her baby, who was ailing and croupy, had it not been  for the sudden drying up of that sensitive fountain, she would have  felt safe and relieved. Perhaps it was this which tended to make all her  impressions mournful and gloomy. As the tide rapidly fell, a great flock  of black brent fluttered by her, screaming and crying. Then the plover  flew"]]]
