I'm glad, though, that I left the snake on the other side of the  bushes.\"    \"So are we,\" said the two hedgehog boys.    \"But you didn't leave me there. I'm here!\" suddenly cried a voice, and out  wiggled the snake again. He started to catch the rabbit, but those two  brave hedgehog boys grabbed up a lot of mud, and plastered it in that  snake's eyes so that he couldn't see, and he had to wiggle down to the  pond to wash it out.    Then Uncle Wiggily and the boys were safe, and he helped them to make  another mud pie, with stones in for raisins, and he gave them some of his  real cherry pie, and oh! how they liked it! Then they were all happy, and  Uncle Wiggily stayed at the hedgehog's house until the next morning.    Now, in case the little girl in the next house brings me a watermelon ice  cream cone with a rose on top, I'll tell you on the next page about Uncle  Wiggily and the elephant.          STORY XXIII    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE ELEPHANT      Uncle Wiggily didn't sleep very well at the hedgehog's house that night,  and the reason for it was this: You see they didn't have many beds there,  and first the rabbit gentleman lay down with the smallest little porcupine  boy, in his bed.    But pretty soon, along about in the middle of the night, this little boy  got to dreaming that he was a rubber ball. And he rolled over in the bed,  and he rolled up against Uncle Wiggily, and the stickery-stickers from the  little hedgehog chap stuck in the old gentleman rabbit.    \"Oh, dear!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, \"I think I'll have to go and sleep with  your brother Jimmie.\"    So he went over to the other hedgehog boy's bed, but land sakes flopsy-dub  and a basket of soap bubbles!    As soon as the rabbit got in there that other hedgehog chap began to dream  that he was a jumping jack, and so he jumped up and down, and he jumped  on top of Uncle Wiggily, and stuck more stickery-stickers in him, until at  last the rabbit got up and said:    \"Oh, dear, I guess I'll have to go to sleep on the floor.\"    So he did that, putting his head on his satchel for a pillow and pulling  his red-white-and-blue-striped-barber-pole crutch over him for a cover.  And, in the morning, he felt a little better.    \"Well, I think I will travel on once more,\" said Uncle Wiggily after a  breakfast of strawberries, and mush and milk. \"I may find my fortune  to-day.\"    The hedgehog boys wanted him to stay with them, and make more mud pies, or  even a cherry one, but the rabbit gentleman said he had no time. So off he  went over hills and down dales, and along through the woods.    Pretty soon, not so very long, just as Uncle Wiggily was walking behind a  big rock, as large as a house, he heard some one crying. Oh, such a loud  crying voice as it was, and the old rabbit gentleman was a bit frightened.    \"For it sounds like a giant crying,\" he said to himself. \"And if it's a  giant he may be a bad one, who would hurt me. I guess I'll run back the  other way.\"    Well, he started to run, but, just as he did so, he heard the voice  crying again, and this time it said:    \"Oh, dear me! Oh, if some one would only help me! Oh, I am in such  trouble!\"    \"Come, I don't believe that is a giant after all,\" thought the rabbit. \"It  may be Sammie Littletail, who has grown to be such a big boy that I won't  know him any more.\" So he took a careful look, but instead of seeing his  little rabbit nephew, he saw a big elephant, sitting on the ground, crying  as hard as he could cry.    Now, you know, when an elephant cries it isn't like when you cry once in a  great while, or when baby cries every day. No, indeed! An elephant cries  so very many tears that if you don't have a water pail near you, to catch  them, you may get your feet wet; that is, if you don't have on rubbers.    Well, that's the way it was this time. The elephant was crying big, salty  tears, about the size of rubber balls, and they were rolling down from his  eyes and along his trunk, which was like a fire engine hose, until there  was quite a little stream of water flowing down the hill toward the  rabbit.    \"Oh, please don't cry any more!\" called Uncle Wiggily.    \"Why not?\" asked the elephant, sadly-like, and he cried harder than  before.    \"Because if you do,\" replied the rabbit, \"I will have to get a pair of  rubber boots, in which to wade out to see you.\"    \"I'll try to stop,\" said the big animal, but, instead, he cried harder  than before, boo-hooing and hoo-booing, until you would have thought it  was raining, and Uncle Wiggily wished he had an umbrella.    \"Why, whatever is the matter?\" asked the rabbit.    \"Oh, I stepped on a tack,\" answered the elephant, \"and it is sticking in  my foot. I can't walk, and I can't dance and I can't get back to the  circus. Oh, dear! Oh, dear me, suz-dud and a red balloon! Oh, how  miserable I am!\"    \"Too bad,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"Was it a large tack that you stepped on?\"    \"Was it?\" asked the elephant, sort of painful-like. \"Why, it feels as big  as a dishpan in my foot. Here, you look, and perhaps you can pull it out.\"    He raised up one of his big feet, which were about as large as a washtub  full of clothes, on Monday morning, and he held it out to Uncle Wiggily.    \"Why, I can't see anything here,\" said the rabbit, looking at the big foot  through his spectacles.    \"Oh, dear! It's there all right!\" cried the elephant. \"It feels like two  wash tubs now,\" and he began to cry some more.    \"Here! Hold on, if you please!\" shouted Uncle Wiggily. \"I'll have to make  a boat, if you keep on shedding so many tears, for there will be a lake  here. Wait, I'll look once more.\"    So he looked again, and this time he saw just the little, tiniest,  baby-tack you can imagine--about the size of a pinhead--sticking in the  elephant's foot.    \"Wait! I have it! Was this it?\" suddenly asked the rabbit, as he took hold  of the tack in his paw and pulled it out.    \"That's it!\" exclaimed the elephant, waving his trunk. \"It's out! Oh, how  much better I feel. Whoop-de-doodle-do!\" and then he felt so fine that he  began to dance. Then, all of a sudden, he began to cry once more.    \"Why, what in the world is the matter now?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, wishing  he had a pail, so that he might catch the elephant's salty tears.    \"Oh, I feel so happy that I can't help crying, because my pain is gone!\"  exclaimed the big creature. Then he cried about forty-'leven bushels of  tears, and a milk bottle full besides, and there was a little pond around  him, and Uncle Wiggily was in it up to his neck.    Then, all of a sudden, in came swimming the alligator, right toward the  rabbit.    \"Ah, now I'll get you!\" cried the skillery-scalery beast.    \"No you won't!\" shouted the elephant, \"Uncle Wiggily is my friend!\" So he  put his trunk down in the water, and sucked it all up, and then he  squirted it over the trees. That left the alligator on dry land, and then  the elephant grabbed the alligator up in his strong trunk, and tossed him  into the briar bushes, scalery-ailery tail and all, and the alligator  crawled away after a while.    So that's how Uncle Wiggily was saved from the alligator by the crying  elephant, and the rabbit and elephant traveled on together for some days.  Now, as I see the sand man coming, I must stop.    But, in case I don't fall into the washtub with my new suit on, and get it  all colored sky-blue-pink, so I can't go to the picnic, I'll tell you next  about Uncle Wiggily and the cherry tree.          STORY XXIV    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CHERRY TREE      Uncle Wiggily Longears and the crying elephant were walking along together  one day, talking about the weather, and wondering if it would rain, and  all things like that. Only the elephant wasn't crying any more, for the  rabbit had pulled the tack that was hurting him, out of the big beast's  foot, you remember.    \"We'll travel on together to find our fortune, and look for adventures,\"  said the elephant, as he capered about, and stood on his hind legs,  because he felt so jolly. \"Won't we have fun, Uncle Wiggily?\"    \"Well, we may,\" spoke the old gentleman rabbit, \"but I don't see how we  are going to carry along on our travels enough for us to eat. Of course,  _I_ don't need much, but _you_ are such a big chap that you will have to  have quite a lot, and my valise is small.\"    \"Don't worry about that,\" replied the elephant. \"Of course you might think  I could carry a lot of pie and cake and bread and butter in my trunk, but  really I can't you know, for about all that my trunk will hold is water.  However, I think I can pick what hay and grass I want from along the  road.\"    \"Yes, and perhaps we may meet a man with a hot peanut wagon, once in a  while,\" suggested Uncle Wiggily, \"and he may give you some peanuts.\"    \"Oh, joy! I hope he does!\" cried the big fellow. \"I just love hot  peanuts!\" Well, they went on together for some time, when, all of a sudden  a man jumped out from behind the bushes, and exclaimed:    \"Ha, Mr. Elephant! I've been looking for you. Now you come right back with  me to the circus where you belong.\" And he went up to the elephant and  took hold of his trunk.    \"Oh, I don't want to go,\" whined the tremendous creature. \"I want to stay  with Uncle Wiggily, and have some fun.\"    \"But you can't,\" said the man. \"You are needed in the circus. A lot of  boys and girls are waiting in the tent, to give you peanuts and popcorn.\"    \"Well,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#16)"],[1,"Africa; and to the  pastoral Hereros the alienation of their land is inconceivable.[90] [See  map page 105.]    A tribe of hunters can never be more than a small horde, because the  simple, monotonous savage economy permits no concentration of  population, no division of labor except that between the sexes, and  hence no evolution of classes. The common economic level of all is  reflected in the simple social organization,[91] which necessarily has  little cohesion, because the group must be prepared to break up and  scatter in smaller divisions, when its members increase or its savage  supplies decrease even a little. Such primitive groups cannot grow into  larger units, because these would demand more roots sent down into the  sustaining soil; but they multiply by fission, like the infusorial  monads, and thereafter lead independent existences remote from each  other. This is the explanation of multiplication of dialects among  savage tribes.    [Sidenote: Land bond in fisher tribes.]    Fishing tribes have their chief occupation determined by their habitats,  which are found along well stocked rivers, lakes, or coastal fishing  grounds. Conditions here encourage an early adoption of sedentary life,  discourage wandering except for short periods, and facilitate the  introduction of agriculture wherever conditions of climate and soil  permit. Hence these fisher folk develop relatively large and permanent  social groups, as testified by the ancient lake-villages of Switzerland,  based upon a concentrated food-supply resulting from a systematic and  often varied exploitation of the local resources. The cooeperation and  submission to a leader necessary in pelagic fishing often gives the  preliminary training for higher political organization.[92] All the  primitive stocks of the Brazilian Indians, except the mountain Ges, are  fishermen and agriculturists; hence their annual migrations are kept  within narrow limits. Each linguistic group occupies a fixed and  relatively well defined district.[93] Stanley found along the Congo  large permanent villages of the natives, who were engaged in fishing and  tilling the fruitful soil, but knew little about the country ten miles  back from the river. These two generous means of subsistence are  everywhere combined in Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia: there they  are associated with dense populations and often with advanced political  organization, as we find it in the feudal monarchy of Tonga and the  savage Fiji Islands.[94] Fisher tribes, therefore, get an early impulse  forward in civilization;[95] and even where conditions do not permit the  upward step to agriculture, these tribes have permanent relations with  their land, form stable social groups, and often utilize their location  on a natural highway to develop systematic trade. For instance, on the  northwest coast of British Columbia and Southern Alaska, the Haida,  Tlingit and Tsimshean Indians have portioned out all the land about  their seaboard villages among the separate families or households as  hunting, fishing, and berrying grounds. These are regarded as private  property and are handed down from generation to generation. If they are  used by anyone other than the owner, the privilege must be paid for.  Every salmon stream has its proprietor, whose summer camp can be seen  set up at the point where the run of the fish is greatest. Combined with  this private property in land there is a brisk trade up and down the  coast, and a tendency toward feudalism in the village communities, owing  to the association of power and social distinction with wealth and  property in land.[96]    [Sidenote: Land bond in pastoral societies.]    Among pastoral nomads, among whom a systematic use of their territory  begins to appear, and therefore a more definite relation between land  and people, we find a more distinct notion than among wandering hunters  of territorial ownership, the right of communal use, and the distinct  obligation of common defense. Hence the social bond is drawn closer. The  nomad identifies himself with a certain district, which belongs to his  tribe by tradition or conquest, and has its clearly defined boundaries.  Here he roams between its summer and winter pastures, possibly one  hundred and fifty miles apart, visits its small arable patches in the  spring for his limited agricultural ventures, and returns to them in the  fall to reap their meager harvest. Its springs, streams, or wells assume  enhanced value, are things to be fought for, owing to the prevailing  aridity of summer; while ownership of a certain tract of desert or  grassland carries with it a certain right in the bordering settled  district as an area of plunder.[97]    The Kara-Kirghis stock, who have been located since the sixteenth  century on Lake Issik-Kul, long ago portioned out the land among the  separate families, and determined their limits by natural features of  the landscape.[98] Sven Hedin found on the Tarim River poles set up to  mark the boundary between the Shah-yar and Kuchar tribal pastures.[99]  John de Plano Carpini, traveling over southern Russia in 1246,  immediately after the Tartar conquest, found that the Dnieper, Don,  Volga and Ural rivers were all boundaries between domains of the various  millionaries or thousands, into which the Tartar horde was  organized.[100] The population of this vast country was distributed  according to the different degrees of fertility and the size of the  pastoral groups.[101] Volney observed the same distinction in the  distribution of the Bedouins of Syria. He found the barren cantons held  by small, widely scattered tribes, as in the Desert of Suez; but the  cultivable cantons, like the Hauran and the Pachalic of Aleppo, closely  dotted by the encampments of the pastoral owners.[102]    The large range of territory held by a nomadic tribe is all successively  occupied in the course of a year, but each part only for a short period  of time. A pastoral use of even a good district necessitates a move of  five or ten miles every few weeks. The whole, large as it may be, is  absolutely necessary for the annual support of the tribe. Hence any  outside encroachment upon their territory calls for the united  resistance of the tribe. This joint or social action is dictated by  their common interest in pastures and herds. The social administration  embodied in the apportionment of pastures among the families or clans  grows out of the systematic use of their territory, which represents a  closer relation between land and people than is found among purely  hunting tribes. Overcrowding by men or livestock, on the other hand,  puts a strain upon the social bond. When Abraham and Lot, typical  nomads, returned from Egypt to Canaan with their large flocks and herds,  rivalry for the pastures occasioned conflicts among their shepherds, so  the two sheiks decided to separate. Abraham took the hill pastures of  Judea, and Lot the plains of Jordan near the settled district of  Sodom.[103]    [Sidenote: Geographical mark of low-type societies.]    The larger the amount of territory necessary for the support of a given  number of people, whether the proportion be due to permanent poverty of  natural resources as in the Eskimo country, or to retarded economic  development as among the Indians of primitive America or the present  Sudanese, the looser is the connection between land and people, and the  lower the type of social organization. For such groups the organic  theory of society finds an apt description. To quote Spencer, \"The  original clusters, animal and social, are not only small, but they lack  density. Creatures of low type occupy large spaces considering the small  quantity of animal substance they contain; and low-type societies spread  over areas that are wide relatively to the number of their component  individuals.\"[104] In common language this means small tribes or even  detached families sparsely scattered over wide areas, living in  temporary huts or encampments of tepees and tents shifted from place to  place, making no effort to modify the surface of the land beyond  scratching the soil to raise a niggardly crop of grain or tubers, and no  investment of labor that might attach to one spot the sparse and migrant  population. [See density maps pages 8 and 9.]    [Sidenote: Land and state.]    The superiority over this social type of the civilized state lies in the  highly organized utilization of its whole geographic basis by the mature  community, and in the development of government that has followed the  increasing density of population and multiplication of activities  growing out of this manifold use of the land. Sedentary agriculture,  which forms its initial economic basis, is followed by industrialism and  commerce. The migratory life presents only limited accumulation of  capital, and restricts narrowly its forms. Permanent settlement  encourages accumulation in every form, and under growing pressure of  population slowly reveals the possibilities of every foot of ground, of  every geographic advantage. These are the fibers of the land which  become woven into the whole fabric of the nation's life. These are the  geographic elements constituting the soil in which empires are rooted;  they rise in the sap of the nation.    [Sidenote: Strength of the land bond in the state.]    The geographic basis of a state embodies a whole complex of physical  conditions which may influence its historical development. The most  potent of these are its size and zonal location; its situation, whether  continental or insular, inland or maritime, on the open ocean or an  enclosed sea; its boundaries, whether drawn by sea, mountain, desert or  the faint demarking line of a river; its forested mountains, grassy  plains, and arable lowlands; its climate and drainage system; finally  its equipment with plant and animal life, whether indigenous or  imported, and its mineral"]]]
