He therefore  ordered a Court of Inquiry to be held to enable him to ascertain the  real cause of the ill-feeling which so evidently existed.    In the General's opinion, the statements recorded in the proceedings  of this Court clearly established the fact, that the Native officers  and sepoys were undoubtedly imbued with the belief that an unholy  mixture of cow's fat and lard had been used in the manufacture of the  new cartridge, and he recommended that the rifle ammunition should in  future be made up with the same description of paper that had always  been used for the musket-cartridge, which, he conceived, would put an  end to their suspicions and uneasiness.    The General, however, was told in reply that it was impossible to use  the old paper for the new cartridge, as the bore of the rifle being  much smaller than that of the musket, thinner paper was indispensable;  and he was directed to inform the sepoys that the new paper, though  tougher and less bulky, was made of exactly the same material as the  old. With respect to the lubricating mixture, he was to announce that  the Government had authorized the preparation of a grease, composed of  wax and oil, which was to be made up and applied to the cartridges  by the men themselves. These orders were carefully explained to the  Native troops, but without any good result. Their religious objection  to the new cartridge was not removed, and they frankly acknowledged  their fears.    On the 6th February an officer of the 34th Native Infantry at  Barrackpore was informed by a sepoy of his company that the four  Native regiments at that station, fearing that they would be forced  to destroy their caste and become Christians, had determined to rise  against their officers, and when they had plundered and burned their  bungalows, to proceed to Calcutta and try to seize Fort William,  or, if that proved beyond their powers, to take possession of the  treasury.    This circumstance was reported to Government by General Hearsay on the  11th February. In the same letter he said, 'We have at Barrackpore  been living upon a mine ready for explosion,' and he reported a story  which had reached him from Dum-Dum of a sepoy, on his way to cook  his food with his _lota_[1] full of water, meeting a low-caste man  belonging to the arsenal where the Enfield cartridges were being  manufactured. This man, it was said, asked the sepoy to allow him to  drink from his _lota_. The sepoy, a Brahmin, refused, saying: 'I have  scoured my _lota_; you will defile it by your touch.' The low-caste  man replied: 'You think much of your caste, but wait a little: the  _Sahib-logue_[2] will make you bite cartridges soaked in cow's fat,  and then where will your caste be?' The sepoy no doubt believed the  man, and told his comrades what was about to happen, and the report  rapidly spread to other stations.    Early in March several of the Hindu sepoys belonging to the Dum-Dum  School of Musketry expressed their unwillingness to bite the new  cartridge, and the Commandant proposed that the drill should be  altered so as to admit of the cartridge being torn instead of bitten.  Hearsay supported the proposal, remarking that the new mode of loading  need not be made to appear as a concession to agitation, but as part  of the drill for the new weapon. Events, however, moved so quickly  that, before sanction could be received to this suggestion, the troops  at Berhampur had broken into open mutiny. They refused to receive  their ammunition, on the ground of its being polluted, even after  it was explained to them that they were not being given the new  cartridges, but those which had been made up in the regiment a year  before. That night they broke open the bells-of-arms, and carried off  their muskets.    The Government then became aware that prompt action was necessary.  They decided that such open mutiny could not be excused on the grounds  of religious scruples, and ordered the regiment to be disbanded. As  Berhampur was somewhat isolated, and some distance from European  troops, it was arranged that the disbandment should take place at the  Head-Quarters of the Presidency division, and the 19th Native Infantry  was accordingly ordered to march to Barrackpore.    The revolt of this regiment brought forcibly before Lord Canning and  his advisers the perilous position of Lower Bengal, owing to the  paucity of European troops. Well may the authorities have been  startled, for between Calcutta and Meerut, a distance of 900 miles,  there were only four regiments of British infantry and a few scattered  Artillerymen, numbering in all less than 5,000, while the Native  troops amounted to upwards of 55,000. One of the four Infantry  regiments was at Fort William; but as only a portion of it could  be spared for the disbandment of the 19th, a special steamer was  despatched to Rangoon to bring over the 84th Foot. This regiment  reached Calcutta on the 20th March, and on the 31st the disbandment of  the mutinous Native Infantry regiment was carried out. The men were  paid up and escorted across the river Hughly, whence they were allowed  to proceed to their homes. They behaved in the most orderly manner on  the march from Berhampur and throughout the proceedings, and as they  left the parade-ground they cheered General Hearsay, and wished him a  long life, apparently well pleased at being let off so easily.    At Barrackpore itself an outbreak had occurred two days before in the  34th Native Infantry. As I have already related, the sepoy, Mangal  Pandy, shot at the sergeant-major.[3] The Adjutant, on hearing  what had happened, galloped to the parade-ground. As he neared the  quarter-guard he was fired at, and his horse shot by the mutineer, who  then badly wounded him with a sword as he was trying to disentangle  himself from the fallen animal. The General now appeared on the scene,  and, instantly grasping the position of affairs, rode straight at  Mangal Pandy, who stood at bay with his musket loaded, ready to  receive him. There was a shot, the whistle of a bullet, and a man fell  to the ground--but not the General; it was the fanatic sepoy himself,  who at the last moment had discharged the contents of his musket into  his own breast! The wretched man had been worked up to a pitch of  madness by the sepoys of his regiment, who stood by while he attacked  the Adjutant, and would have allowed him to kill their Commander, but  they were too great cowards to back him up openly. Mangal Pandy was  not dead. He was taken to the hospital, and eventually was tried by  a Court-Martial composed of Native officers, sentenced to death, and  hanged in the presence of all the troops at Barrackpore. The Native  officer in command of the quarter-guard met the same fate, and the  regiment was then disbanded.    The orders for the disbandment of the 19th and 34th Native Infantry  were directed to be read to every Native corps in the service, and  it was hoped that the quick retribution which had overtaken these  regiments would check the spirit of mutiny throughout the army. For  a time this hope appeared to be justified. Satisfactory reports were  received from different parts of Bengal, and anything like a serious  or general outbreak was certainly not contemplated by the authorities.  General Hearsay reported to Government that he had directed the  European troops, temporarily located at Barrackpore, to return to  their respective cantonments, as he did not think it probable that  he would require their presence again. About the same time Sir John  Lawrence, after visiting the Musketry School at Sialkot, wrote  hopefully to the Governor-General of the aspect of affairs in the  Punjab. Lord Canning and his advisers, owing to these favourable  reports, were on the point of sending the 84th Foot back to Burma,  when news reached them from Upper India of the calamitous occurrences  at Meerut and Delhi.    The Meerut division was commanded by Major-General Hewitt, an officer  of fifty years' service, and the station of Meerut by Brigadier  Archdale Wilson, Commandant of the Bengal Artillery. The garrison  consisted of the 6th Dragoon Guards, a troop of Horse Artillery, a  battery of Field Artillery, a company of Foot Artillery, the 1st  Battalion 60th Rifles, and three Native corps--the 3rd Light Cavalry,  and the 11th and 20th Native Infantry.    Towards the end of April incendiary fires began to take place, and  the Native soldiers evinced more or less disrespect in their manner  towards their officers. These signs of disaffection were followed  by the refusal of some of the troopers of the 3rd Light Cavalry to  receive their cartridges, although the commanding officer carefully  explained to them that they were not the new cartridges, but the very  same they had always used, and that according to the new drill they  were not required to bite them when loading their carbines.    A Court of Inquiry was held to investigate the matter, composed  entirely of Native officers, three of whom belonged to the offending  regiment. The verdict of the Court was that no adequate cause could be  assigned for the disobedience of orders in refusing to receive and use  the cartridges that were served out. 'The only conclusion the Court  can arrive at in regard to this point is that a report seems to have  got abroad which in some vague form attaches suspicion of impurity  to the materials used for making these cartridges, but the Court are  unanimously of opinion that there is nothing whatever objectionable in  the cartridges of the 3rd Regiment Light Cavalry, and that they may be  freely received and used as heretofore without in the slightest degree  affecting any religious scruple of either a Hindu or Mussulman, and if  any pretence contrary to that is urged, that it must be false.'

(2) Psalm xxxvii. 4.      CHAPTER XIII    Of the obedience of one in lowly subjection after the example of Jesus Christ    \"My Son, he who striveth to withdraw himself from obedience,  withdraweth himself also from grace, and he who seeketh private  advantages, loseth those which are common unto all.  If a man  submit not freely and willingly to one set over him, it is a sign  that his flesh is not yet perfectly subject to himself, but  often resisteth and murmureth.  Learn therefore quickly to submit  thyself to him who is over thee, if thou seekest to bring thine  own flesh into subjection.  For the outward enemy is very quickly  overcome if the inner man have not been laid low.  There is no  more grievous and deadly enemy to the soul than thou art to  thyself, if thou art not led by the Spirit.  Thou must not  altogether conceive contempt for thyself, if thou wilt prevail  against flesh and blood.  Because as yet thou inordinately lovest  thyself, therefore thou shrinkest from yielding thyself to the  will of others.    2. \"But what great thing is it that thou, who art dust and  nothingness, yieldest thyself to man for God's sake, when I, the  Almighty and the Most High, who created all things out of  nothing, subjected Myself to man for thy sake?  I became the most  humble and despised of men, that by My humility thou mightest  overcome thy pride.  Learn to obey, O dust!  Learn to humble  thyself, O earth and clay, and to bow thyself beneath the feet of  all.  Learn to crush thy passions, and to yield thyself in all  subjection.    3. \"Be zealous against thyself, nor suffer pride to live within  thee, but so show thyself subject and of no reputation, that all  may be able to walk over thee, and tread thee down as the clay in  the streets.  What hast thou, O foolish man, of which to  complain?  What, O vile sinner, canst thou answer those who  speak against thee, seeing thou hast so often offended God, and  many a time hast deserved hell?  But Mine eye hath spared thee,  because thy soul was precious in My sight; that thou mightest  know My love, and mightest be thankful for My benefits; and that  thou mightest give thyself altogether to true subjection and  humility, and patiently bear the contempt which thou meritest.\"      CHAPTER XIV    Of meditation upon the hidden judgments of God, that we may not  be lifted up because of our well-doing    Thou sendest forth Thy judgments against me, O Lord, and shakest  all my bones with fear and trembling, and my soul trembleth  exceedingly.  I stand astonished, and remember that the heavens  are not clean in thy sight.(1)  If Thou chargest Thine angels  with folly, and didst spare them not, how shall it be unto me?  Stars have fallen from heaven, and what shall I dare who am  but dust?  They whose works seemed to be praiseworthy, fell into  the lowest depths, and they who did eat Angels' food, them have I  seen delighted with the husks that the swine do eat.    2. There is therefore no holiness, if Thou O Lord, withdraw Thine  hand.  No wisdom profiteth, if Thou leave off to guide the helm.  No strength availeth, if Thou cease to preserve.  No purity is  secure, if Thou protect it not.  No self-keeping availeth, if Thy  holy watching be not there.  For when we are left alone we are  swallowed up and perish, but when we are visited, we are raised  up, and we live.  For indeed we are unstable, but are made strong  through Thee; we grow cold, but are rekindled by Thee.    3. Oh, how humbly and abjectly must I reckon of myself, how must  I weigh it as nothing, if I seem to have nothing good!  Oh, how  profoundly ought I to submit myself to Thy unfathomable  judgments, O Lord, when I find myself nothing else save nothing,  and again nothing!  Oh weight unmeasurable, oh ocean which cannot  be crossed over, where I find nothing of myself save nothing  altogether!  Where, then, is the hiding-place of glory, where the  confidence begotten of virtue?  All vain-glory is swallowed up in  the depths of Thy judgments against me.    4. What is all flesh in Thy sight?  For how shall the clay boast  against Him that fashioned it?(2)  How can he be lifted up in  vain speech whose heart is subjected in truth to God?  The whole  world shall not lift him up whom Truth hath subdued; nor shall he  be moved by the mouth of all who praise him, who hath placed all  his hope in God.  For they themselves who speak, behold, they  are all nothing; for they shall cease with the sound of their  words, but the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.(3)    (1) Job xv. 15.   (2) Psalm xxix. 16.   (3) Psalm cxvii. 2.      CHAPTER XV    How we must stand and speak, in everything that we desire    \"My Son, speak thou thus in every matter, 'Lord, if it please  Thee, let this come to pass.  Lord, if this shall be for Thine  honour, let it be done in Thy Name.  Lord, if thou see it good  for me, and approve it as useful, then grant me to use it for Thy  honour.  But if thou knowest that it shall be hurtful unto me,  and not profitable for the health of my soul, take the desire  away from me'!  For not every desire is from the Holy Ghost,  although it appear to a man right and good.  It is difficult to  judge with certainty whether a good or an evil spirit move thee  to desire this or that, or whether thou art moved by thine own  spirit.  Many have been deceived at the last, who seemed at the  beginning to be moved by a good spirit.    2. \"Therefore, whatsoever seemeth to thee desirable, thou must  always desire and seek after it with the fear of God and humility  of heart, and most of all, must altogether resign thyself, and  commit all unto Me and say, 'Lord, thou knowest what is best; let  this or that be, according as Thou wilt.  Give what Thou wilt, so  much as Thou wilt, when Thou wilt.  Do with me as Thou knowest  best, and as best shall please Thee, and as shall be most to  Thine honour.  Place me where Thou wilt, and freely work Thy will  with me in all things.  I am in Thine hand, and turn me in my  course.  Behold, I am Thy servant, ready for all things; for I  desire to live not to myself but to Thee.  Oh, that I might live  worthily and perfectly.'\"      A PRAYER TO BE ENABLED TO DO GOD'S WILL PERFECTLY    3. Grant me Thy grace, most merciful Jesus, that it may be with  me, and work in me, and persevere with me, even unto the end.  Grant that I may ever desire and wish whatsoever is most pleasing  and dear unto Thee.  Let Thy will be mine, and let my will alway  follow Thine, and entirely accord with it.  May I choose and  reject whatsoever Thou dost; yea, let it be impossible for me to  choose or reject except according to Thy will.    4. Grant that I may die to all worldly things, and for Thy sake  love to be despised and unknown in this world.  Grant unto me,  above all things that I can desire, to rest in Thee, and that in  Thee my heart may be at peace.  Thou art the true peace of the  heart, Thou alone its rest; apart from Thee all things are hard  and unquiet.  In Thee alone, the supreme and eternal God, I will  lay me down in peace and take my rest.(1)  Amen.    (1) Psalm iv. 9.      CHAPTER XVI    That true solace is to be sought in God alone    Whatsoever I am able to desire or to think of for my solace, I  look for it not here, but hereafter.  For if I alone had all the  solaces of this world, and were able to enjoy all its delights,  it is certain that they could not endure long.  Wherefore, O my  soul, thou canst be fully comforted and perfectly refreshed, only  in God, the Comforter of the poor, and the lifter up of the  humble.  Wait but a little while, my soul, wait for the Divine  promise, and thou shalt have abundance of all good things in  heaven.  If thou longest too inordinately for the things which  are now, thou shalt lose those which are eternal and heavenly.  Let temporal things be in the use, eternal things in the desire.  Thou canst not be satisfied with any temporal good, for thou wast  not created for the enjoyment of these.    2. Although thou hadst all the good things which ever were  created, yet couldst not thou be happy and blessed; all thy  blessedness and thy felicity lieth in God who created all things;  not such felicity as seemeth good to the foolish lover of the  world, but such as Christ's good and faithful servants wait for,  and as the spiritual and pure in heart sometimes taste, whose  conversation is in heaven.(1)  All human solace is empty and  short-lived; blessed and true is that solace which is felt  inwardly, springing from the truth.  The godly man everywhere  beareth about with him his own Comforter, Jesus, and saith unto  Him: \"Be with me, Lord Jesus, always and everywhere.  Let it be  my comfort to be able to give up cheerfully all human comfort.  And if Thy consolation fail me, let Thy will and righteous  approval be alway with me for the highest comfort.  For Thou wilt  not always be chiding, neither keepest Thou Thine anger for  ever.\"(2)    (1) Philippians iii. 20.   (2) Psalm cii. 9.      CHAPTER XVII    That all care is to be cast upon God    \"My Son, suffer me to do with thee what I will; I know what is  expedient for thee.  Thou thinkest as a man, in many things thou  judgest as human affection persuadeth thee.\"    2. Lord, what Thou sayest is true.  Greater is Thy care for me  than all the care which I am able to take for myself.  For too  insecurely doth he stand who casteth not all his care upon Thee.  Lord, so long as my will standeth right and firm in Thee, do with  me what Thou wilt, for whatsoever Thou shalt do with me cannot be  aught but good.  Blessed be Thou if Thou wilt leave me in  darkness: blessed also be Thou if Thou wilt leave me in light.  Blessed be Thou if Thou"]]]
