My eyes can almost pierce through  the deal and see the lovely garments folded away inside.\"    Alice took no notice; she marched on to her room. Kathleen followed her.    \"The boys shall bring it up for me immediately after dinner,\" she said.  \"I sha'n't be going out again until I go to Mrs. Weldon's. I expect  people will open their eyes when they see me to-night.\"    \"You must please yourself, of course,\" said Alice. \"For my part, I am  extremely sorry that the trunk has come. You were settling down a  little, and were not quite so objectionable as at first.\"    \"Thanks _awfully_, darling,\" said Kathleen, dropping a mock curtsy.    \"Not quite so objectionable,\" continued Alice in a calm voice. \"But now,  with all these silly gewgaws, you will be worse titan ever. But please  clearly understand that I do not want any of your ornaments.\"    \"Don't trouble yourself, darling; they were not made for you. I force my  treasures on nobody.\"    \"I wouldn't wear them if you were to give them. I hope I have some  proper pride.\"    \"Pride of the _most_ proper sort,\" said Kathleen, dancing before her.    \"And I do hope, also, that you won't make yourself a merry-andrew or a  figure of fun at the Weldons' to-night. It will be in extremely bad  taste. We are not going to have a large party--just one or two of the  mistresses and little Ruth Craven, who, although she is a foundationer,  seems to be a very nice sort of child. It would be in the worst taste  possible to wear anything but the simplest clothes.\"    \"All right,\" said Kathleen. \"If I am a chatterbox, you are about the  greatest preacher, with the most long-winded sermons, that ever entered  a house. You are a perfect plague to me, and that is the truth, Alice  Tennant.\"    Alice poured some water into her basin, washed her hands, and went  downstairs.    \"Mother,\" she said, \"I am obliged to be out the whole afternoon. The  scholarship examination takes place in six weeks now, and if I am to  have any chance of getting through I must not idle a single moment. I  grieve to say that a box of finery has arrived for Kathleen--most  unsuitable, for she has plenty of clothes. I do trust, mother, you will  keep her in tow a little this afternoon, and not allow her to make a  show of herself.\"    \"You are not very kind to Kathleen,\" said Mrs. Tennant. \"Why shouldn't  the child enjoy her pretty things? I like to see girls nicely dressed.  It is a great trial to me to be obliged to deny you the ribbons and  frills and laces which most girls of your age possess.\"    \"Thanks, mother,\" answered Alice; \"but if you were as Rich as Croesus, I  should not wish, while I am a schoolgirl, to dress any better than I  do.\"    \"You certainly have a great deal of sense, dear; but don't be too hard  on the little girl. Ah! here she comes. Now we must sit down to dinner  at once.\"    During dinner Kathleen's eyes sparkled so brightly, and she looked so  merry and mysterious, that both the boys gazed at her in wonder.    \"Don't mind me,\" she said, whispering to David as she bent towards him.  \"It's in real downright delight I am. I am expecting to have the most  wonderful joy all the afternoon that was ever given a girl. Ah, then,  it's illegant myself will be when you see me next, boys. And do look at  her! I declare she's getting crosser each minute.\"    \"Hush, Kathleen!\" said David. \"You must not say unkind things.\"    \"Don't trouble to reprove her, David,\" called out Alice in a calm and  lofty tone. \"I assure you she doesn't annoy me in the least. Sometimes I  think there is a little gnat flying about and trying to sting me, but  that's all.\"    \"And a charming metaphor, too,\" said Kathleen.    She ate her meal soberly, but occasionally a bubble of laughter came to  the surface, and her merry eyes glanced from Mrs. Tennant's face to  Alice's, and from Alice's to those of the boys. The moment the meal came  to an end Kathleen jumped up.    \"Now, then, my angels, you come with me,\" she said, and she caught David  by the one hand and Ben by the other, and led her willing slaves into  the hall.    \"Did you ever see anything like it?\" said Alice to her mother. \"She will  ruin the boys in addition to all her other mischief. Mother, must we  keep her long? It is really most disturbing.\"    \"If you would only take poor little Kathleen as she is, you would find  her quite agreeable, Alice,\" was her mother's answer.    \"Oh dear, mother! you seem to be just as much infatuated as the others.  But never mind. I am off now, and I need not be back in the house until  it is time to dress to go to Mrs. Weldon's. I declare that girl is  causing me to hate my home. I don't think its fair, whatever you may say  to the contrary.\"    Mrs. Tennant sighed. Alice had always been a little difficult; she was  more than difficult at the present moment. But very soon afterwards the  welcome bang of the hall door was heard, and the house was free.    \"Now for a jolly time,\" said Kathleen. \"Tired one, where are you?\"    \"Kathleen, you ought not to call me by that name. You ought to be more  respectful.\"    \"Arrah, then, darling, I can't; 'tain't in me. I am so fond of you--oh,  worra, worra! there's nothing I wouldn't do for you; but I must be as  I'm made. You do look tired, and tired you will go on looking until I  take you to Carrigrohane to rest you and to feed you with good milk and  good fruit and good eggs and good cream.--Now then, boys, lift up that  trunk. Be aisy with it, so that you won't hurt it. Take it up to my  bedroom and put it on the floor. Maybe there's something in it for you,  or maybe there isn't--Mrs. Tennant, acushla! you will come along  upstairs with me at once. You can bring your mending basket, and I will  pop you into the arm-chair by the window, and we can consult together  over the garments. It's fine I'll look when I have them on. Aunt Katie  O'Flynn is a woman who has real taste, and I know she is going to dress  me up as no other girl ever was dressed before in the Great Shirley  School.\"    Mrs. Tennant could not help laughing. The boys were also in the highest  good-humor; Kathleen's mirth was contagious. They went upstairs to the  bedroom, and then Ben saucily perched himself on the foot of one of the  beds; while David, having brought up a hammer and screwdriver, proceeded  to lift the lid of the box, which was firmly nailed down. Under the lid  was a lot of tissue-paper. Kathleen went on her knees, lifted it up,  uttered a shout, and turned to the boys.    \"You make off now,\" she said.    \"No, indeed I won't,\" said Ben. \"I want to see the fun.\"    \"Go, both of you. There will be something nice for you when you come  back to tea,\" said Kathleen.    They looked regretful, but saw nothing for it but to go. Kathleen in a  breathless sort of way, scarcely uttering a word, spread out her  treasures on the bed. Was there ever such a box? Skirts, bodices,  blouses, shirts; an evening dress, an afternoon dress, a morning  dress--they seemed simply endless. Then there were frills and ribbons  and veils; there were two great, big, very stylish-looking hats, with  long plumes; and there was a little toque made of crimson velvet, which  Kathleen declared was quite too sweet for anything. There were also  dozens of handkerchiefs, dozens of pairs of stockings, and some sweet  little slippers all embroidered and fit for the most bewitching feet in  the world. Kathleen's cheeks got redder and redder.    \"Here's a cargo for you,\" she said. \"Here's something to delight the  heart. Now, my dear Mrs. Tennant, let us come and examine everything. Do  you think I am utterly selfish, Mrs. Tennant? Do you think I want all  these things for myself?\"    \"I am sure you don't, dear.\"    \"It quite makes me ache with longing to give some of them away. I don't  want so many frocks: there are a good dozen here all told. Aunt Katie  O'Flynn's the one for extravagance, bless her! and for having a thing  done in style, bless her! I should like you to see her. It's  splendacious she is entirely when she's dressed up in her best--velvet  and feathers and laces and jewels. Why, nothing holds her in bounds;  there's nothing she stops at. I have seen her give hundreds of pounds  for one little glittering gem. Ah! and here's a ring. Look, Mrs.  Tennant.\"    Kathleen had now opened a small box which was lying at the bottom of the  great trunk. There were several treasures in it: a necklet of glittering  white stones, another of blue, another of red, and this little ring--a  little ring which contained a solitary diamond of the purest water.    \"Now I shall look stylish,\" said Kathleen, and she slipped the ring on  the third finger of her left hand.    \"My wedding finger too, bedad!\" she said.    When the contents of the trunk had been finally explored, Kathleen  began to sort her finery. Mrs. Tennant gave advice.    \"Some of these things are a little too fine for everyday use,\" she said.  \"But some of these blouses are very suitable, and so are these white and  gray and pink shirts. And this blue bodice is quite nice for the  evening, and so is the skirt belonging to it; but this and this and  this--I wouldn't wear these until I went home if I were you, my love.\"    Kathleen glanced at her. A slight frown came between her brows.    \"Don't you see,\" she said impatiently, \"that I want to give away some of  these things? Do you see this dozen of blouses, all exactly alike, in  this box? These are for the secret society.\"    \"The what, Kathleen?\"    \"Oh, you musn't tell--it is the most profound secret--but I have joined  one. Being an Irish girl, it is quite natural. I sent a line to Aunt  Katie to get a dozen of the very prettiest blouses she could. Of course  there are a lot more members, but our Cabinet has risen to something  like a dozen, so I thought I'd have them handy. Aren't they just sweet?\"    As she spoke she took out of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15868"],[0,"The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales (#16)"],[1," right.    But Seneca knew what was right. Seneca also had a well-trained  conscience, which told him of right and of wrong. Seneca's brother,  Gallio, had saved Paul's life when a Jewish mob would have dragged him  to pieces in Corinth; and the legend is that Seneca and Paul had  corresponded with each other before they stood together in Nero's  presence, the one as counsellor, the other as the criminal.[L] When Paul  arose from that formal salutation, when the apostle of the new  civilization spoke to the tottering monarch of the old, if there had  been one man in that assemblage, could he have failed to see that that  was a turning-point in the world's history? Before him in that little  hall, in that little hour, was passing the scene which for centuries  would be acted out upon the larger stage.    Faith on the one side, before expediency and cruelty on the other! Paul  before Seneca and Nero! He was ready to address Nero, with the eloquence  and vehemence which for years had been demanding utterance.    He stood at length before the baby Caesar, to whose tribunal he had  appealed from the provincial court of a doubting Festus and a trembling  Agrippa.    And who shall ask what words the vigorous Christian spoke to the dastard  boy! Who that knows the eloquence which rung out on the ears of  astonished Stoics at Athens, which commanded the incense and the  hecatombs of wandering peasants in Asia, which stilled the gabbling  clamor of a wild mob at Jerusalem,--who will doubt the tone in which  Paul spoke to Nero! The boy quailed for the moment before the man! The  gilded dotard shrunk back from the home truths of the new, young,  vigorous faith: the ruler of a hundred legions was nothing before the  God-commissioned prisoner.    No; though at this audience all men forsook Paul, as he tells us; though  not one of the timid converts were there, but the soldier chained at  his side,--still he triumphed over Nero and Nero's minister.    From that audience-hall those three men retire. The boy, grown old in  lust, goes thence to be an hour alone, to ponder for an hour on this  God, this resurrection, and this truth, of which the Jew, in such  uncourtly phrase, has harangued him. To be alone, until the spectre of a  dying mother rises again to haunt him, to persecute him and drive him  forth to his followers and feasters, where he will try to forget Paul  and the Saviour and God, where he would be glad to banish them forever.  He does not banish them forever! Henceforward, whenever that spectre of  a mother comes before him, it must re-echo the words of God and eternity  which Paul has spoken. Whenever the chained and bleeding captive of the  arena bends suppliant before him, there must return the memory of the  only captive who was never suppliant before him, and his words of sturdy  power!    And Seneca? Seneca goes home with the mortified feelings of a great man  who has detected his own meanness.    We all know the feeling; for all God's children might be great, and it  is with miserable mortification that we detect ourselves in one or  another pettiness. Seneca goes home to say: \"This wild _Easterner_ has  rebuked the Emperor as I have so often wanted to rebuke him. He stood  there, as I have wanted to stand, a man before a brute.    \"He said what I have thought, and have been afraid to say. Downright,  straightforward, he told the Emperor truths as to Rome, as to man, and  as to his vices, which I have longed to tell him. He has done what I am  afraid to do. He has dared this, which I have dallied with, and left  undone. _What is the mystery of his power?_\"    Seneca did not know. Nero did not know. The \"Eastern mystery\" was in  presence before them, and they knew it not!    What was the mystery of Paul's power?    Paul leaves them with the triumph of a man who has accomplished the hope  of long years. Those solemn words of his, \"After that, I _must_ also see  Rome,\" expressed the longing of years, whose object now, in part, at  least, is gratified. He must see Rome!    It is God's mission to him that he see Rome and its Emperor. Paul has  seen with the spirit's eye what we have seen since in history,--that he  is to be the living link by which the electric fire of life should pass  first from religious Asia to quicken this dead, brutish Europe. He knows  that he is God's messenger to bear this mystery of life eternal from the  one land to the other, and to unfold it there. And to-day has made real,  in fact, this his inward confidence. To-day has put the seal of fact on  that vision of his, years since, when he first left his Asiatic home. A  prisoner in chains, still he has to-day seen the accomplishment of the  vows, hopes, and resolutions of that field of Troy, most truly famous  from the night he spent there. There was another of these hours when God  brings into one spot the acts which shall be the _argument_ of centuries  of history. Paul had come down there in his long Asiatic  journeys,--Eastern in his lineage, Eastern in his temperament, Eastern  in his outward life, and Eastern in his faith,--to that narrow  Hellespont, which for long ages has separated East from West, tore madly  up the chains which would unite them, overwhelmed even love when it  sought to intermarry them, and left their cliffs frowning eternal hate  from shore to shore. Paul stood upon the Asian shore and looked across  upon the Western. There were Macedonia and the hills of Greece, here  Troas and the ruins of Ilium. The names speak war. The blue Hellespont  has no voice but separation, except to Paul. But to Paul, sleeping, it  might be, on the tomb of Achilles, that night the \"man of Macedonia\"  appears, and bids him come over to avenge Asia, to pay back the debt of  Troy.    \"Come over _and help us._\" Give us life, for we gave you death. Give us  help for we gave you ruin. Paul was not disobedient to the heavenly  vision. The Christian Alexander, he crosses to Macedon with the words of  peace instead of war,--the Christian shepherd of the people, he carries  to Greece, from Troy, the tidings of salvation instead of carnage, of  charity instead of license. And he knows that to Europe it is the  beginning of her new civilization, it in the dawn of her new warfare, of  her new poetry, of her reign of heroes who are immortal.    That _faith_ of his, now years old, has this day received its crowning  victory. This day, when he has faced Nero and Seneca together, may well  stand in his mind as undoing centuries of bloodshed and of license.    And in this effort, and in that spiritual strength which had nerved him  in planning it and carrying it through, was the \"Asian mystery.\" Ask  what was the secret of Paul's power as he bearded the baby Emperor, and  abashed the baby Philosopher? What did he give the praise to, as he left  that scene? What was the principle in action there, but faith in the new  life, faith in the God who gave it!    We do not wonder, as Seneca wondered, that such a man as Paul dared say  anything to such a boy as Nero! The absolute courage of the new faith  was the motive-power which forced it upon the world. Here were the  sternest of morals driven forward with the most ultra bravery.    Perfect faith gave perfect courage to the first witnesses. And there was  the \"mystery\" of their victories.    And so, in this case, when after a while Seneca again reminded Nero of  his captive, poor Nero did not dare but meet him again. Yet, when he met  him again in that same judgment-hall, he did not dare hear him long;  and we may be sure that there were but few words before, with such  affectation of dignity as he could summon, he bade them set the prisoner  free.    Paul free! The old had faced the new. Each had named its champion. And  the new conquers!          THE DOT AND LINE ALPHABET.      [This sketch was originally published in the Atlantic Monthly for  October, 1858, just at the time that the first Atlantic Cable, whose  first prattle had been welcomed by the acclamations of a continent,  gasped its last under the manipulations of De Sauty. It has since been  copied by Mr. Prescott in his valuable hand-book of the electric  telegraph.    The war, which has taught us all so much, has given a brilliant  illustration of the dot and line alphabet, wholly apart from the  electric use of it, which will undoubtedly be often repeated. In the  movements of our troops under General Foster in North Carolina, Dr. J.B.  Upham of Boston, the distinguished medical director in that department,  equally distinguished for the success with which he has led forward the  musical education of New England, trained a corps of buglers to converse  with each other by long and short bugle-notes, and thus to carry  information with literal accuracy from point to point at any distance  within which the tones of a bugle could be heard. It will readily be  seen that there are many occasions in military affairs when such means  of conversation might prove of inestimable value. Mr. Tuttle, the  astronomer, on duty in the same campaign, made a similar arrangement  with long and short flashes of light.]           *       *       *       *       *    Just in the triumph week of that Great Telegraph which takes its name  from the Atlantic Monthly, I read in the September number of that  journal the revelations of an observer who was surprised to find that he  had the power of reading, as they run, the revelations of the wire. I  had the hope that he was about to explain to the public the more general  use of this instrument,--which, with a stupid fatuity, the public has as  yet failed to grasp. Because its signals have been first applied by  means of electro-magnetism, and afterwards by means of the chemical  power of electricity, the many-headed people refuses to avail itself, as  it might do very easily, of the same signals for the simpler  transmission of intelligence, whatever the power employed.
