Urrea had  clasped his hands to his cheeks that stung like fire, but now he  recognized the boy.    \"Fulton!\" he cried.    The sharp exclamation brought Ned to a realization of his danger. He  seized his rifle, pulled up the serape and sprang back. Already Mexican  soldiers were gathering. It was truly fortunate for Ned that he was  quick of thought, and that his thoughts came quickest when the danger  was greatest. He knew that the cry of \"Fulton!\" was unintelligible to  them, and he exclaimed:    \"Save me, comrades! He tried to beat me without cause, and now he would  kill me, as you see!\"    Urrea had drawn a pistol and was shouting fiery Mexican oaths. The  soldiers, some of them just awakened from sleep, and all of them dazed,  had gathered in a huddle, but they opened to let Ned pass. Excessive and  cruel punishment was common among them. A man might be flogged half to  death at the whim of an officer, and instinctively they protected their  comrade.    As the Mexican group closed up behind him, and between him and Urrea,  Ned ran at top speed toward the west where the arroyo cut across the  plain. More Mexicans were gathering, and there was great confusion.  Everybody was asking what was the matter. The boy's quick wit did not  desert him. There was safety in ignorance and the multitude.    He quickly dropped to a walk and he, too, began to ask of others what  had caused the trouble. All the while he worked steadily toward the  arroyo, and soon he left behind him the lights and the shouting. He now  came into the dark, passed beyond the Mexican lines, and entered the cut  in the earth down which he had come.    He was compelled to sit down on the sand and relax. He was exhausted by  the great effort of both mind and body which had carried him through so  much danger. His heart was beating heavily and he felt dizzy. But his  eyes cleared presently and his strength came back. He considered himself  safe. In the darkness it was not likely that any of the Mexicans would  stumble upon him.    He thought of the Panther and Obed, but he could do nothing for them. He  must trust to meeting them again at the place appointed. He looked at  the Mexican camp. The fires had burned up again there for a minute or  two, but as he looked they sank once more. The noise also decreased.  Evidently they were giving up the pursuit.    Ned rose and walked slowly up the arroyo. He became aware that the night  was very cold and it told on his relaxed frame. He pulled up the serape  again, and now it was for warmth and not for disguise. He stopped at  intervals to search the darkness with his eyes and to listen for noises.  He might meet with an enemy or he might meet with one of his friends. He  was prepared for either. He had regained control of himself both body  and mind, and his ready rifle rested in the hollow of his arm.    He met neither. He heard nothing but the usual sighing of the prairie  wind that ceased rarely, and he saw nothing but the faint glow on the  southern horizon that marked the Mexican camp where he had met his  enemy.    He left the arroyo, and saw a dark shadow on the plain, the figure of a  man, rifle in hand, Ned instantly sprang back into the arroyo and the  stranger did the same. A curve in the line of this cut in the earth now  hid them from each other, and Ned, his body pressed against the bank,  waited with beating heart. He had no doubt that it was a Mexican  sentinel or scout more vigilant than the others, and he felt his danger.    Ned in this crisis used the utmost caution. He did not believe that any  other would come, and it must be a test of patience between him and his  enemy. Whoever showed his head first would be likely to lose in the duel  for life. He pressed himself closer and closer against the bank, and  sought to detect some movement of the stranger. He saw nothing and he  did not hear a sound. It seemed that the man had absolutely vanished  into space. It occurred to Ned that it might have been a mere figment of  the dusk and his excited brain, but he quickly dismissed the idea. He  had seen the man and he had seen him leap into the arroyo. There could  be no doubt of it.    There was another long wait, and the suspense became acute. The man was  surely on the other side of that curve waiting for him. He was held  fast. He was almost as much a prisoner as if he lay bound in the Mexican  camp. It seemed to him, too, that the darkness was thinning a little. It  would soon be day and then he could not escape the notice of horsemen  from Santa Anna's army. He decided that he must risk an advance and he  began creeping forward cautiously. He remembered now what he had  forgotten in the first moments of the meeting. He might yet, even  before this sentinel or scout, pass as a Mexican.    He stopped suddenly when he heard a low whistle in front of him. While  it could be heard but a short distance, it was singularly sweet. It  formed the first bars of an old tune, \"The World Turned Upside Down,\"  and Ned promptly recognized it. The whistle stopped in a moment or two,  but Ned took up the air and continued it for a few bars more. Then, all  apprehension gone, he sprang out of the arroyo and stood upon the bank.  Another figure was projected from the arroyo and stood upon the bank  facing him, not more than twenty feet away.    Simultaneously Obed White and Edward Fulton advanced, shook hands and  laughed.    \"You kept me here waiting in this gully at least half an hour,\" said  Obed. \"Time and I waited long on you.\"    \"But no longer than I waited on you,\" said Ned. \"Why didn't you think of  whistling the tune sooner?\"    \"Why didn't you?\"    They laughed and shook hands again.    \"At any rate, we're here together again, safe and unharmed,\" said Ned.  \"And now to see what has become of the Panther.\"    \"You'd better be lookin' out for yourselves instead of the Panther,\"  growled a voice, as a gigantic figure upheaved itself from the arroyo  eight or ten yards behind them. \"I could have picked you both off while  you were standin' there shakin' hands, an' neither of you would never  have knowed what struck him.\"    \"The Panther!\" they exclaimed joyously, and they shook hands with him  also.    \"An' now,\" said the Panther, \"it will soon be day. We'd better make fur  our horses an' then clear out. We kin tell 'bout what we've seen an'  done when we're two or three miles away.\"    They found the horses safe in the brushwood, Old Jack welcoming Ned with  a soft whinny. They were in the saddle at once, rode swiftly northward,  and none of them spoke for a half hour. When a faint tinge of gray  appeared on the eastern rim of the world the Panther said:    \"My tale's short. I couldn't get into the camp, 'cause I'm too big. The  very first fellow I saw looked at me with s'picion painted all over him.  So I had to keep back in the darkness. But I saw it was a mighty big  army. It can do a lot of rippin', an' t'arin', an' chawin'.\"    \"I got into the camp,\" said Obed, after a minute of silence, \"but as I'm  not built much like a Mexican, being eight or ten inches too tall, men  were looking at me as if I were a strange specimen. One touch of  difference and all the world's staring at you. So I concluded that I'd  better stay on the outside of the lines. I hung around, and I saw just  what Panther saw, no more and no less. Then I started back and I struck  the arroyo, which seemed to me a good way for leaving. But before I had  gone far I concluded I was followed. So I watched the fellow who was  following, and the fellow who was following watched me for about a year.  The watch was just over when you came up, Panther. It was long, but it's  a long watch that has no ending.\"    \"And I,\" said Ned, after another wait of a minute, \"being neither so  tall as Obed nor so big around as the Panther, was able to go about in  the Mexican camp without any notice being taken of me. I saw Santa Anna  arrive to take the chief command.\"    \"Santa Anna himself?\" exclaimed the Panther.    \"Yes, Santa Anna himself. They gave him a great reception. After a while  I started to come away. I met Urrea. He took me for a peon, gave me an  order, and when I didn't obey it tried to strike me across the face with  a whip.\"    \"And what did you do?\" exclaimed the two men together.    \"I took the whip away from him and lashed his cheeks with it. I was  recognized, but in the turmoil and confusion I escaped. Then I had the  encounter with Obed White, of which he has told already.\"    \"Since Santa Anna has come,\" said the Panther, \"they're likely to move  at any moment. We'll ride straight for the cabin an' the boys.\"          CHAPTER VI    FOR FREEDOM'S SAKE      Evidently the horses had found considerable grass through the night, as  they were fresh and strong, and the miles fell fast behind them. At the  gait at which they were going they would reach the cabin that night.  Meanwhile they made plans. The little force would divide and messengers  would go to San Antonio, Harrisburg and other points, with the news that  Santa Anna was advancing with an immense force.    And every one of the three knew that the need was great. They knew how  divided counsels had scattered the little Texan army. At San Antonio,  the most important point of all, the town that they had triumphantly  taken from a much greater force of Mexicans, there were practically no  men, and that undoubtedly was Santa Anna's destination. Unconsciously  they began to urge their horses to great and yet greater speed, until  the Panther recalled them to prudence.    \"Slower, boys! slower!\" he said. \"We mustn't run our horses out at the  start.\"    \"And there's a second reason for pulling down,\" said Ned, \"since there's  somebody else on the plain.\"    His uncommon eyesight had already detected before the others the strange  presence. He pointed toward the East.    \"Do you see that black"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],[0,"Germany, The Next Republic? (#16)"],[1,"the vital interests of  Germany.  In doing so, it gave expression to the fact that it was not  its fault if peace was further withheld from the peoples of Europe.  With a correspondingly greater claim of justification, the German  Government may proclaim its unwillingness before mankind and history to  undertake the responsibility, after twenty-one months of war, to allow  the controversy that has arisen over the submarine question to take a  turn which might seriously affect the maintenance of peace between  these two nations.    \"The German Government guided by this idea notifies the Government of  the United States _that instructions have been issued to German naval  commanders that the precepts of the general international fundamental  principles be observed as regards stopping, searching and destruction  of merchant vessels within the war zone and that such vessels shall not  be sunk without warning and without saving human life unless the ship  attempts to escape or offers resistance_.\"      At the beginning of the war it was a group of military leaders  consisting of General von Moltke, General von Falkenhayn, General von  Mackensen, General von Herringen, Grand Admiral von Tirpitz, and a few  of the Prussian military clique, which prevailed upon the Kaiser to go  to war after the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne and  his wife.  The Allies proclaimed in their publications, in the press  and in Parliaments that they were fighting to destroy and overthrow the  military party in Germany which could make war without public consent.  Millions of Allied soldiers were mobilised and fighting in almost a  complete ring surrounding Germany, Austria Hungary, Bulgaria and  Turkey.  They had been fighting since August, 1914, for twenty-one  months, and still their fighting had not shattered or weakened the hold  which the military party had upon the people and the Kaiser.  Von  Tirpitz and von Falkenhayn, who, shortly after the war began, became  the ringleaders of Germany's organised Might, had fallen not _before  the armed foes on the battlefield but before an unarmed nation with a  president whose only weapon was public opinion_.  First, von Tirpitz  fell because he was ready to defy the United States.  Then came the  downfall of von Falkenhayn, because he was prepared to damn the United  States and all neutrals.  Surely a nation and a government after  thirteen months of patience and hope had a right to believe that after  all public opinion was a weapon which was sometimes more effective than  any other.  Mr. Wilson and the State Department were justified in  feeling that their policy toward Germany was after all successful not  alone because it had solved the vexing submarine issue, but because it  had aided the forces of democracy in Germany.  Because, with the  downfall of von Falkenhayn and von Tirpitz, there was only one  recognised authority in Germany.  That was the Chancellor and the  Foreign Office, supported almost unanimously by the Socialists and by  the Liberal forces which were at work to reform the German Government.    But this was in May, 1916, scarcely eight months before the Kaiser  _changed his mind and again decided to support the people who were  clamouring for a ruthless, murderous, defiant war against the whole  world_, if the world was \"foolish\" enough to join in.          CHAPTER VI    THE PERIOD OF NEW ORIENTATION    Dr. Karl Liebknecht, after he had challenged the Chancellor on the 4th  of April, became the object of attack by the military authorities.  The  Chancellor, although he is the real Minister of Foreign Affairs, is,  also, a Major General in the Army and for a private like Liebknecht to  talk to a Major General as he did in the Reichstag was contrary to all  rules and precedents in the Prussian Army.  The army was ready to send  Liebknecht to the firing squad and it was only a short time until they  had an opportunity to arrest him.  Liebknecht started riots in some of  the ammunition factories and one night at Potsdamer Platz, dressed in  civilian clothes, he shouted, \"Down with the Government,\" and started  to address the passers-by.  He was seized immediately by government  detectives, who were always following him, and taken to the police  station.  His home was searched and when the trial began the papers,  found there, were placed before the military tribunal as evidence that  he was plotting against the Government.  The trial was secret, and  police blockaded all streets a quarter of a mile away from the court  where he was tried.  Throughout the proceedings which lasted a week the  newspapers were permitted to print only the information distributed by  the Wolff Telegraph Bureau.  But public sympathy for Liebknecht was so  great that mounted police were kept in every part of the city day and  night to break up crowds which might assemble.  Behind closed doors,  without an opportunity to consult his friends, with only an attorney  appointed by the Government to defend him, Liebknecht was sentenced to  two years' hard labour.  His only crime was that he had dared to speak  in the Reichstag the opinions of some of the more radical socialists.    Liebknecht's imprisonment was a lesson to other Socialist agitators.  The day after his sentencing was announced there were strikes in nearly  every ammunition factory in and around Berlin.  Even at Spandau, next  to Essen the largest ammunition manufacturing city in Germany, several  thousand workmen left their benches as a protest, but the German people  have such terrible fear of the police and of their own military  organisation that they strike only a day and return the next to forget  about previous events.    If there were no other instances in Germany to indicate that there was  the nucleus for a democracy this would seem to be one.  One might say,  too, that if such leaders as Liebknecht could be assisted, the movement  for more freedom might have more success.    It was very difficult for the German public to accept the German reply  to President Wilson's _Sussex_ note.  The people were bitter against  the United States.  They hated Wilson.  They feared him.  And the idea  of the German Government bending its knee to a man they hated was  enough cause for loud protests.  This feeling among the people found  plenty of outlets.  The submarine advocates, who always had their ears  to the ground, saw that they could take advantage of this public  feeling at the expense of the Chancellor and the Foreign Office.  Prince von Buelow, the former Chancellor, who had been spending most of  his time in Switzerland after his failure to keep Italy out of the war,  had written a book entitled \"Deutsche Politik,\" which was intended to  be an indictment of von Bethmann-Hollweg's international policies.  Von  Buelow returned to Berlin at the psychological moment and began to  mobilise the forces against the Chancellor.    [Illustration: Gott strafe England.]    After the _Sussex_ dispute was ended the Socialist organ _Vorwaerts_,  supported by Philip Scheidemann, leader of the majority of the  Socialists, demanded that the Government take some steps toward peace.  But the General Staff was so busy preparing for the expected Allied  offensive that it had no time to think about peace or about internal  questions.  When von Falkenhayn resigned and von Hindenburg arrived at  Great Headquarters to succeed him the two generals met for the first  time in many months.  (There was bitter feeling between the two.)  Von  Falkenhayn, as he turned the office over to his successor, said:    \"Has Your Excellency the courage to take over this position now?\"    \"I have always had the courage, Your Excellency,\" replied von  Hindenburg, \"but not the soldiers.\"    In the Reichstag there has been only one real democratic party.  That  is the Socialist.  The National Liberal Party, which has posed as a  reform organisation, is in reality nothing more than the party  controlled by the ammunition and war industries.  When these interests  heard that submarine warfare was to be so restricted as to be  practically negligible, they began to sow seeds of discontent among the  ammunition makers.  These interests began to plan for the time when the  submarine warfare would again be discussed.  Their first scheme was to  try to overthrow the Chancellor.  If they were not successful then they  intended to take advantage of the democratic movement which was  spreading in Germany to compel the Government to consent to the  creation of a Reichstag Committee on Foreign Affairs to consult with  the Foreign Office when all questions of international policy,  including submarine warfare, was up for discussion.  Their first policy  was tried early in July.  Seizing that clause in the German note which  said that Germany would hold herself free to change her promises in the  _Sussex_ case if the United States was not successful against England,  the Navy began to threaten the United States with renewed submarine  warfare unless President Wilson acted against Great Britain.    Reporting some of these events on June 12th, the _Evening Ledger_ of  Philadelphia printed the following despatch which I sent:      \"BERLIN, July 12.--The overthrow of Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg,  champion of a conciliatory policy toward the United States, and the  unloosing of German submarines within three months, was predicted by  von Tirpitz supporters here to-day unless President Wilson acts against  the British blockade.    \"Members of the Conservative party and those favouring annexation of  territory conquered by Germany joined in the forecast.  They said the  opinion of America will be disregarded.    \"A private source, close to the Foreign Office, made this statement  regarding the attempt to unseat Bethmann-Hollweg at a time when the war  is approaching a crisis:    \"'Unless America does something against England within the next three  months there will be a bitter"]]]
