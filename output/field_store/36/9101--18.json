And if these four qualities of  line be used judiciously, a great deal of expressive power is added to  your shading. And, as will be explained in the next chapter, somewhat  the same principle applies to the direction of the swing of the brush in  painting.    Shading lines should never be drawn backwards and forwards from left to  right (scribbled), except possibly where a mystery of shadow is wanted  and the lines are being crossed in every direction; but never when lines  are being used to express form. They are not sufficiently under control,  and also the little extra thickness that occurs at the turn is a  nuisance.    The crossing of lines in shading gives a more opaque look. This is  useful to suggest the opaque appearance of the darker passage that  occurs in that part of a shadow nearest the lights; and it is sometimes  used in the half tones also.    Draughtsmen vary very much in their treatment of hair, and different  qualities of hair require different treatment. The particular beauty of  it that belongs to point drawing is the swing and flow of its lines.  These are especially apparent in the lights. In the shadows the flow of  line often stops, to be replaced by a mystery of shadow. So that a play  of swinging lines alternating with shadow passages, drawn like all the  other shadows with parallel lines not following the form, is often  effective, and suggests the quality of hair in nature. The swinging  lines should vary in thickness along their course, getting darker as  they pass certain parts, and gradating into lighter lines at other parts  according to the effect desired. (See illustration, page 102  [Transcribers Note: Plate XXI].)    [Illustration: Plate XXI.    STUDY IN RED CHALK    Illustrating a treatment of hair in line-work.]    To sum up, in the method of line drawing we are trying to explain (the  method employed for most of the drawings by the author in this book) the  lines of shading are made parallel in a direction that comes easy to the  hand, unless some quality in the form suggests their following other  directions. So that when you are in doubt as to what direction they  should follow, draw them on the parallel principle. This preserves a  unity in your work, and allows the lines drawn in other directions for  special reasons to tell expressively.    As has already been explained, it is not sufficient in drawing to  concentrate the attention on copying accurately the visual appearance of  anything, important as the faculty of accurate observation is. Form to  be expressed must first be appreciated. And here the science of teaching  fails. \"You can take a horse to the fountain, but you cannot make him  drink,\" and in art you can take the student to the point of view from  which things are to be appreciated, but you cannot make him see. How,  then, is this appreciation of form to be developed? Simply by feeding.  Familiarise yourself with all the best examples of drawing you can find,  trying to see in nature the same qualities. Study the splendid drawing  by Puvis de Chavannes reproduced on page 104 [Transcribers Note: Plate  XXII]. Note the way the contours have been searched for expressive  qualities. Look how the expressive line of the back of the seated  figure has been \"felt,\" the powerful expression of the upraised arm with  its right angle (see later page 155 [Transcribers Note: Diagram XII],  chapter on line rhythm). And then observe the different types of the two  standing figures; the practical vigour of the one and the soft grace of  the other, and how their contours have been studied to express this  feeling, &c. There is a mine of knowledge to be unearthed in this  drawing.    There never was an age when such an amount of artistic food was at the  disposal of students. Cheap means of reproduction have brought the  treasures of the world's galleries and collections to our very doors in  convenient forms for a few pence. The danger is not from starvation, but  indigestion. Students are so surfeited with good things that they often  fail to digest any of them; but rush on from one example to another,  taking but snapshot views of what is offered, until their natural powers  of appreciation are in a perfect whirlwind of confused ideas. What then  is to be done? You cannot avoid the good things that are hurled at you  in these days, but when you come across anything that strikes you as  being a particularly fine thing, feed deeply on it. Hang it up where you  will see it constantly; in your bedroom, for instance, where it will  entertain your sleepless hours, if you are unfortunate enough to have  any. You will probably like very indifferent drawings at first, the  pretty, the picturesque and the tricky will possibly attract before the  sublimity of finer things. But be quite honest and feed on the best that  you genuinely like, and when you have thoroughly digested and  comprehended that, you will weary of it and long for something better,  and so, gradually, be led on to appreciate the best you are capable  of appreciating.    [Illustration: Plate XXII.    STUDY FOR DECORATION AT AMIENS \"REPOSE\" BY PEUVIS DE CHAVANNES    Note how the contours are searched for expressive forms, the power given  to the seated figure by the right angle of the raised arm, and the  contrast between the upright vigour of the right-hand figure with the  softer lines of the middle one.    _Photo Neurdein_]    Before closing this chapter there are one or two points connected with  the drawing of a head that might be mentioned, as students are not  always sufficiently on the look out for them.    In our diagram on page 107 [Transcribers Note: Diagram VI], let Fig. 1  represent a normal eye. At Fig. 2 we have removed the skin and muscles  and exposed the two main structural features in the form of the eye,  namely the bony ring of the socket and the globe containing the lenses  and retina. Examining this opening, we find from A to B that it runs  smoothly into the bony prominence at the top of the nose, and that the  rest of the edge is sharp, and from point C to E quite free. It is at  point A, starting from a little hole, that the sharp edge begins; and  near this point the corner of the eye is situated: A, Figs. 1, 2, 3.  From points A to F the bony edge of the opening is very near the surface  and should be looked for.    The next thing to note is the fact that the eyebrow at first follows the  upper edge of the bony opening from B to C, but that from point C it  crosses the free arch between C and D and soon ends. So that considering  the under side of the eyebrow, whereas from point C towards B there is  usually a cavernous hollow, from C towards D there is a prominence. The  character of eyes varies greatly, and this effect is often modified by  the fleshy fulness that fills in the space between the eyelid and the  brow, but some indication of a change is almost always to be observed at  a point somewhere about C, and should be looked out for. Any bony  prominence from this point towards D should be carefully constructed.  Look out for the bone, therefore, between the points CD and AF.    Never forget when painting an eye that what we call the white of the eye  is part of a sphere and will therefore have the light and shade of a  sphere. It will seldom be the same tone all over; if the light is coming  from the right, it will be in shade towards the left and vice versa.  Also the eyelids are bands of flesh placed on this spherical surface.  They will therefore partake of the modelling of the sphere and not be  the same tone all across. Note particularly the sudden change of plane  usually marked by a fold, where the under eyelid meets the surface  coming from the cheek bone. The neglect to construct these planes of the  under eyelid is a very common fault in poorly painted eyes. Note also  where the upper eyelid comes against the flesh under the eyebrow  (usually a strongly marked fold) and the differences of planes that  occur at this juncture. In some eyes, when there is little loose flesh  above the eyelid, there is a deep hollow here, the eyelid running up  under the bony prominence, C D. This is an important structural line,  marking as it does the limit of the spherical surface of the eyeball, on  which surface the eyelids are placed.    Fig. 4 is a rough diagram of the direction it is usual for the hairs  forming the eyebrow to take. From A a few scant hairs start radiating  above the nose and quite suddenly reach their thickest and strongest  growth between B and E. They continue, still following a slightly  radiating course until D. These hairs are now met by another lot,  starting from above downwards, and growing from. B to C. An eyebrow is  considered by the draughtsman as a tone of a certain shape and  qualities of edge. And what interests us here is to note the effect of  this order of growth upon its appearance as tone. The meeting of the  strong growth of hair upwards with the downward growth between points B  and E creates what is usually the darkest part of the eyebrow at this  point. And the coming together of the hairs towards D often makes  another dark part in this direction. The edge from C to B is nearly  always a soft one, the tone melting into the flesh, and this should be  looked out for, giving as it does a pretty variety to the run of the  line. Another thing that tends to make this edge soft is the fact that a  bony prominence is situated here and has usually a high light upon it  that crosses the eyebrow. From C to D you usually find a sharper edge,  the hairs running parallel to the line of the eyebrow, while from D to B  and A to B a softer boundary can be looked for. The chief accent will  generally be found at B, where a dark mass often comes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1429"],[0,"The Garden Party, and Other Stories (#16)"],[1,"that wasn't perfect--just love?  How he loved her! He squeezed hard against the chest of drawers and  murmured to it, \"I love her, I love her!\" And just for the moment he was  with her on the way to Umtali. It was night. She sat in a corner asleep.  Her soft chin was tucked into her soft collar, her gold-brown lashes lay  on her cheeks. He doted on her delicate little nose, her perfect lips,  her ear like a baby's, and the gold-brown curl that half covered it.  They were passing through the jungle. It was warm and dark and far away.  Then she woke up and said, \"Have I been asleep?\" and he answered, \"Yes.  Are you all right? Here, let me--\" And he leaned forward to... He bent  over her. This was such bliss that he could dream no further. But it  gave him the courage to bound downstairs, to snatch his straw hat from  the hall, and to say as he closed the front door, \"Well, I can only try  my luck, that's all.\"    But his luck gave him a nasty jar, to say the least, almost immediately.  Promenading up and down the garden path with Chinny and Biddy, the  ancient Pekes, was the mater. Of course Reginald was fond of the mater  and all that. She--she meant well, she had no end of grit, and so on.  But there was no denying it, she was rather a grim parent. And there had  been moments, many of them, in Reggie's life, before Uncle Alick died  and left him the fruit farm, when he was convinced that to be a widow's  only son was about the worst punishment a chap could have. And what made  it rougher than ever was that she was positively all that he had. She  wasn't only a combined parent, as it were, but she had quarrelled with  all her own and the governor's relations before Reggie had won his first  trouser pockets. So that whenever Reggie was homesick out there, sitting  on his dark veranda by starlight, while the gramophone cried, \"Dear,  what is Life but Love?\" his only vision was of the mater, tall and  stout, rustling down the garden path, with Chinny and Biddy at her  heels...    The mater, with her scissors outspread to snap the head of a dead  something or other, stopped at the sight of Reggie.    \"You are not going out, Reginald?\" she asked, seeing that he was.    \"I'll be back for tea, mater,\" said Reggie weakly, plunging his hands  into his jacket pockets.    Snip. Off came a head. Reggie almost jumped.    \"I should have thought you could have spared your mother your last  afternoon,\" said she.    Silence. The Pekes stared. They understood every word of the mater's.  Biddy lay down with her tongue poked out; she was so fat and glossy she  looked like a lump of half-melted toffee. But Chinny's porcelain eyes  gloomed at Reginald, and he sniffed faintly, as though the whole world  were one unpleasant smell. Snip, went the scissors again. Poor little  beggars; they were getting it!    \"And where are you going, if your mother may ask?\" asked the mater.    It was over at last, but Reggie did not slow down until he was out  of sight of the house and half-way to Colonel Proctor's. Then only he  noticed what a top-hole afternoon it was. It had been raining all the  morning, late summer rain, warm, heavy, quick, and now the sky was  clear, except for a long tail of little clouds, like ducklings, sailing  over the forest. There was just enough wind to shake the last drops off  the trees; one warm star splashed on his hand. Ping!--another drummed  on his hat. The empty road gleamed, the hedges smelled of briar, and how  big and bright the hollyhocks glowed in the cottage gardens. And here  was Colonel Proctor's--here it was already. His hand was on the gate,  his elbow jogged the syringa bushes, and petals and pollen scattered  over his coat sleeve. But wait a bit. This was too quick altogether.  He'd meant to think the whole thing out again. Here, steady. But he was  walking up the path, with the huge rose bushes on either side. It can't  be done like this. But his hand had grasped the bell, given it a pull,  and started it pealing wildly, as if he'd come to say the house was on  fire. The housemaid must have been in the hall, too, for the front door  flashed open, and Reggie was shut in the empty drawing-room before that  confounded bell had stopped ringing. Strangely enough, when it did, the  big room, shadowy, with some one's parasol lying on top of the grand  piano, bucked him up--or rather, excited him. It was so quiet, and yet  in one moment the door would open, and his fate be decided. The feeling  was not unlike that of being at the dentist's; he was almost reckless.  But at the same time, to his immense surprise, Reggie heard himself  saying, \"Lord, Thou knowest, Thou hast not done much for me... \" That  pulled him up; that made him realize again how dead serious it was. Too  late. The door handle turned. Anne came in, crossed the shadowy space  between them, gave him her hand, and said, in her small, soft voice,  \"I'm so sorry, father is out. And mother is having a day in town,  hat-hunting. There's only me to entertain you, Reggie.\"    Reggie gasped, pressed his own hat to his jacket buttons, and stammered  out, \"As a matter of fact, I've only come... to say good-bye.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Anne softly--she stepped back from him and her grey eyes  danced--\"what a very short visit!\"    Then, watching him, her chin tilted, she laughed outright, a long, soft  peal, and walked away from him over to the piano, and leaned against it,  playing with the tassel of the parasol.    \"I'm so sorry,\" she said, \"to be laughing like this. I don't know why I  do. It's just a bad ha--habit.\" And suddenly she stamped her grey shoe,  and took a pocket-handkerchief out of her white woolly jacket. \"I really  must conquer it, it's too absurd,\" said she.    \"Good heavens, Anne,\" cried Reggie, \"I love to hear you laughing! I  can't imagine anything more--\"    But the truth was, and they both knew it, she wasn't always laughing;  it wasn't really a habit. Only ever since the day they'd met, ever since  that very first moment, for some strange reason that Reggie wished to  God he understood, Anne had laughed at him. Why? It didn't matter where  they were or what they were talking about. They might begin by being  as serious as possible, dead serious--at any rate, as far as he was  concerned--but then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, Anne would  glance at him, and a little quick quiver passed over her face. Her lips  parted, her eyes danced, and she began laughing.    Another queer thing about it was, Reggie had an idea she didn't herself  know why she laughed. He had seen her turn away, frown, suck in her  cheeks, press her hands together. But it was no use. The long, soft peal  sounded, even while she cried, \"I don't know why I'm laughing.\" It was a  mystery...    Now she tucked the handkerchief away.    \"Do sit down,\" said she. \"And smoke, won't you? There are cigarettes in  that little box beside you. I'll have one too.\" He lighted a match for  her, and as she bent forward he saw the tiny flame glow in the pearl  ring she wore. \"It is to-morrow that you're going, isn't it?\" said Anne.    \"Yes, to-morrow as ever was,\" said Reggie, and he blew a little fan of  smoke. Why on earth was he so nervous? Nervous wasn't the word for it.    \"It's--it's frightfully hard to believe,\" he added.    \"Yes--isn't it?\" said Anne softly, and she leaned forward and rolled  the point of her cigarette round the green ash-tray. How beautiful  she looked like that!--simply beautiful--and she was so small in that  immense chair. Reginald's heart swelled with tenderness, but it was her  voice, her soft voice, that made him tremble. \"I feel you've been here  for years,\" she said.    Reginald took a deep breath of his cigarette. \"It's ghastly, this idea  of going back,\" he said.    \"Coo-roo-coo-coo-coo,\" sounded from the quiet.    \"But you're fond of being out there, aren't you?\" said Anne. She hooked  her finger through her pearl necklace. \"Father was saying only the other  night how lucky he thought you were to have a life of your own.\" And  she looked up at him. Reginald's smile was rather wan. \"I don't feel  fearfully lucky,\" he said lightly.    \"Roo-coo-coo-coo,\" came again. And Anne murmured, \"You mean it's  lonely.\"    \"Oh, it isn't the loneliness I care about,\" said Reginald, and he  stumped his cigarette savagely on the green ash-tray. \"I could stand any  amount of it, used to like it even. It's the idea of--\" Suddenly, to his  horror, he felt himself blushing.    \"Roo-coo-coo-coo! Roo-coo-coo-coo!\"    Anne jumped up. \"Come and say good-bye to my doves,\" she said. \"They've  been moved to the side veranda. You do like doves, don't you, Reggie?\"    \"Awfully,\" said Reggie, so fervently that as he opened the French window  for her and stood to one side, Anne ran forward and laughed at the doves  instead.    To and fro, to and fro over the fine red sand on the floor of the dove  house, walked the two doves. One was always in front of the other. One  ran forward, uttering a little cry, and the other followed, solemnly  bowing and bowing. \"You see,\" explained Anne, \"the one in front, she's  Mrs. Dove. She looks at Mr. Dove and gives that little laugh and runs  forward, and he follows her, bowing and bowing. And that makes her laugh  again. Away she runs, and after her,\" cried Anne, and she sat back on  her heels, \"comes poor Mr. Dove, bowing and bowing... and that's their  whole life. They never do anything else, you know.\" She got up and took  some yellow grains out of a bag on the roof of the dove house. \"When  you think of them, out in Rhodesia, Reggie, you can be sure that is what  they will be doing... \"    Reggie gave no sign of having seen the doves or of having heard a word.  For the moment he was conscious only of the immense effort it took to  tear his secret out of himself and offer it to Anne. \"Anne, do you think  you could ever care for me?\" It was done. It was over. And in the little  pause that followed Reginald saw the garden open to"]]]
