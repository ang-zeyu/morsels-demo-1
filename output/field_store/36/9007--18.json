Everett, Mulberry, Florida          FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)    Pearl Randolph, Field Worker  Madison, Florida  November 24, 1936    DUNCAN GAINES      Duncan Gaines, the son of George and Martha Gaines was born on a  plantation in Virginia on March 12, 1853. He was one of four children,  all fortunate enough to remain with their parents until maturity. They  were sold many times, but Duncan Gaines best remembers the master who  was known as \"old man Beever.\"    On this plantation were about 50 slaves, who toiled all day in the  cotton and tobacco fields and came home at dusk to cook their meals of  corn pone, collards and sweet potatoes on the hearths of their one room  cabins. Biscuits were baked on special occasions by placing hot coals  atop the iron tops of long legged frying pans called spiders, and the  potatoes were roasted in the ashes, likewise the corn pone. Their  masters being more or less kind, there was pork, chicken, syrup and  other foodstuffs that they were allowed to raise as their own on a small  scale. This work was often done by the light of a torch at night as they  had little time of their own. In this way slaves earned money for small  luxuries and the more ambitious sometimes saved enough money to buy  their freedom, although this was not encouraged very much.    The early life of Duncan was carefree and happy. With the exception of  carrying water to the laborers and running errands, he had little to do.  Most of the time of the slave children was spent in playing ball and  wrestling and foraging the woods for berries and fruits and playing  games as other children. They were often joined in their play by the  master's children, who taught them to read and write and fired Duncan  with the ambition to be free, so that he could \"wear a frill on his  colar and own a pair of shoes that did not have brass caps on the toes\"  and require the application of fat to make them shine.    Wearing his shoes shined as explained above and a coarse homespun suit  dyed with oak bark, indigo or poke berries, he went to church on Sunday  afternoons after the whites had had their services and listened to  sermons delivered by white ministers who taught obedience to their  masters. After the services, most of the slaves would remove their shoes  and carry them in their hands, as they were unaccustomed to wearing  shoes except in winter.    The women were given Saturday afternoons off to launder their clothes  and prepare for Sunday's services. All slaves were required to appear on  Monday mornings as clean as possible with their clothing mended and  heads combed.    Lye soap was used both for laundering and bathing. It was made from  fragments of fat meat and skins that were carefully saved for that  purpose. Potash was secured from oak ashes. This mixture was allowed to  set for a certain period of time, then cooked to a jelly-like  consistency. After cooling, the soap was cut into square bars and  \"lowanced out\" (allowance) to the slaves according to the number in each  family. Once Duncan was given a bar of \"sweet\" soap by his mistress for  doing a particularly nice piece of work of polishing the harness of her  favorite mare and so proud was he of the gift that he put it among his  Sunday clothes to make them smell sweet. It was the first piece of  toilet sopa that he had ever seen; and it caused quite a bit of envy  among the other slave children.    Duncan Gaines does not remember his grandparents but thinks they were  both living on some nearby plantation. His father was the plantation  blacksmith and Duncan liked to look on as plowshares, single trees,  horse shoes, etc were turned out or sharpened. His mother was strong and  healthy, so she toiled all day in the fields. Duncan always listened for  his mother's return from the field, which was heraled by a song, no  matter how tired she was. She was very fond of her children and did not  share the attitude of many slave mother who thought of their children as  belonging solely to the masters. She lived in constant fear that \"old  marse Seever\" would meet with some adversity and be forced to sell them  separately. She always whispered to them about \"de war\" and fanned to a  flame their desire to be free.    At that time Negro children listened to the tales of _Raw Head and  Bloody Bones_, various animal stories and such childish ditties as:      \"Little Boy, Little Boy who made your breeches?    Mamma cut 'em out and pappa sewed de stitches.\"    Children were told that babies were dug out of tree stumps and were  generally made to \"shut up\" if they questioned their elders about such  matters.    Children with long or large heads were thought to be marked to become  \"wise men.\" Everyone believed in ghosts and entertained all the  superstitions that have been handed down to the present generation.  There was much talk of \"hoodooism\" and anyone ill for a long time  without getting relief from herb medicines was thought to be \"fixed\" or  suffering from some sin that his father had committed.    Duncan was 12 years of age when freedom was declared and remembers the  hectic times which followed. He and other slave children attended  schools provided by the Freedmen' Aid and other social organizations  fostered by Northerners. Most of the instructors were whites sent to the  South for that purpose.    The Gaines were industrious and soon owned a prosperous farm. They  seldom had any money but had plenty of foodstuffs and clothing and a  fairly comfortable home. All of the children secured enough learning to  enable them to read and write, which was regarded as very unusual in  those days. Slaves had been taught that their brain was inferior to the  whites who owned them and for this reason, many parents refused to send  their children to school, thinking it a waste of time and that too much  learning might cause some injury to the brain of their supposedly  weak-minded children.    Of the various changes, Duncan remembers very little, so gradual did  they occur in his section. Water was secured from the spring or well.  Perishable foodstuffs were let down into the well to keep cool. Shoes  were made from leather tanned by setting in a solution of red oak bark  and water; laundering was done in wooden tubs, made from barrels cut in  halves. Candles were used for lighting and were made from sheep and beef  tallow. Lightwood torches were used by those not able to afford candles.  Stockings were knitted by the women during cold or rainy weather.  Weaving and spinning done by special slave women who were too old to  work in the fields; others made the cloth into garments. Everything was  done by hand except the luxuries imported by the wealthy.    Duncan Gaines is now a widower and fast becoming infirm. He looks upon  this \"new fangled\" age with bare tolerance and feels that the happiest  age of mankind has passed with the discarding of the simple, old  fashioned way of doing things.

Judge Williams owned 102 heads of slaves and was known to be \"tolable  nice to 'em in some way and pretty rough on 'em in other ways\" says Mr.  Gantling. \"He would'nt gi' us no coffee, 'cept on Sunday Mornings when  we would have shorts or seconds of wheat, which is de leavins' of flour  at mills, yu' know, but we had plenty bacon, corn bread, taters and  peas.    \"As a child I uster have to tote water to de old people on de farm and  tend de cows an' feed de sheep.

The black check in western  hemlock is the result of insect attacks.[29] The reddish-brown  streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly  the result of injury by birds.[30] The discoloration is merely  an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of  itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain rot-producing  fungi impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become  criterions of weakness. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungous  growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.[31]    [Footnote 29: See Burke, H.E.: Black check in western hemlock.  Cir. No. 61, U.S. Bu. Entomology, 1905.]    [Footnote 30: See McAtee, W.L.: Woodpeckers in relation to trees  and wood products. Bul. No. 39, U.S. Biol. Survey, 1911.]    [Footnote 31: See Von Schrenck, Hermann: The \"bluing\" and the  \"red rot\" of the western yellow pine, with special reference to  the Black Hills forest reserve. Bul.

One form of it  is produced in lumber by the method of sawing and has no  reference to the natural arrangement of the wood elements. Thus  if the plane of the saw is not approximately parallel to the  axis of the log the grain of the lumber cut is not parallel to  the edges and is termed diagonal. This is likely to occur where  the logs have considerable taper, and in this case may be  produced if sawed parallel to the axis of growth instead of  parallel to the growth rings.    Lumber and timber with diagonal grain is always weaker than  straight-grained material, the extent of the defect varying with  the degree of the angle the fibres make with the axis of the  stick. In the vicinity of large knots the grain is likely to be  cross. The defect is most serious where wood is subjected to  flexure, as in beams.    _Spiral grain_ is a very common defect in a tree, and when  excessive renders the timber valueless for use except in the  round. It is produced by the arrangement of the wood fibres in a  spiral direction about the axis instead of exactly vertical.  Timber with spiral grain is also known as \"torse wood.\" Spiral  grain usually cannot be detected by casual inspection of a  stick, since it does not show in the so-called visible grain of  the wood, by which is commonly meant a sectional view of the  annual rings of growth cut longitudinally. It is accordingly  very easy to allow spiral-grained material to pass inspection,  thereby introducing an element of weakness in a structure.    There are methods for readily detecting spiral grain. The  simplest is that of splitting a small piece radially. It is  necessary, of course, that the split be radial, that is, in a  plane passing through the axis of the log, and not tangentially.  In the latter case it is quite probable that the wood would  split straight, the line of cleavage being between the growth  rings.    In inspection, the elements to examine are the rays. In the case  of oak and certain other hardwoods these rays are so large that  they are readily seen not only on a radial surface, but on the  tangential as well. On the former they appear as flakes, on the  latter as short lines. Since these rays are between the fibres  it naturally follows that they will be vertical or inclined  according as the tree is straight-grained or spiral-grained.  While they are not conspicuous in the softwoods, they can be  seen upon close scrutiny, and particularly so if a small hand  magnifier is used.    When wood has begun to dry and check it is very easy to see  whether or not it is straight- or spiral-grained, since the  checks will for the most part follow along the rays. If one  examines a row of telephone poles, for example, he will probably  find that most of them have checks running spirally around them.  If boards were sawed from such a pole after it was badly checked  they would fall to pieces of their own weight. The only way to  get straight material would be to split it out.    It is for this reason that split billets and squares are  stronger than most sawed material. The presence of the spiral  grain has little, if any, effect on the timber when it is used  in the round, but in sawed material the greater the pitch of the  spiral the greater is the defect.        KNOTS      _Knots_ are portions of branches included in the wood of the  stem or larger branch. Branches originate as a rule from the  central axis of a stem, and while living increase in size by the  addition of annual woody layers which are a continuation of  those of the stem. The included portion is irregularly conical  in shape with the tip at the pith. The direction of the fibre is  at right angles or oblique to the grain of the stem, thus  producing local cross grain.    During the development of a tree most of the limbs, especially  the lower ones, die, but persist for a time--often for years.  Subsequent layers of growth of the stem are no longer intimately  joined with the dead limb, but are laid around it. Hence dead  branches produce knots which are nothing more than pegs in a  hole, and likely to drop out after the tree has been sawed into  lumber. In grading lumber and structural timber, knots are  classified according to their form, size, soundness, and the  firmness with which they are held in place.[32]    [Footnote 32: See Standard classification of structural timber.  Yearbook Am. Soc. for Testing Materials, 1913, pp. 300-303.  Contains three plates showing standard defects.]    Knots materially affect checking and warping, ease in working,  and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber  and depreciate its value for structural purposes where strength  is an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more  serious where timber is subjected to bending and tension than  where under compression. The extent to which knots affect the  strength of a beam depends upon their position, size, number,  direction of fibre, and condition. A knot on the upper side is  compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension.  The knot, especially (as is often the case) if there is a season  check in it, offers little resistance to this tensile stress.  Small, knots, however, may be so located in a beam along the  neutral plane as actually to increase the strength by tending to  prevent longitudinal shearing. Knots in a board or plank are  least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to  its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam  do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion  one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not  serious defects.    Extensive experiments by the U.S. Forest Service[33] indicate  the following effects of knots on structural timbers:    [Footnote 33: Bul. 108, pp. 52 _et seq._]    (1) Knots do not materially influence the stiffness of  structural timber.    (2) Only defects of the most serious character affect the  elastic limit of beams. Stiffness and elastic strength are more  dependent upon the quality of the wood fibre than upon defects  in the beam.    (3) The effect of knots is to reduce the difference between the  fibre stress at elastic limit and the modulus of rupture of  beams. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects.    (4) Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression  parallel to the grain.[34]    [Footnote 34: Bul. 115, U.S. Forest Service: Mechanical  properties of western hemlock, p. 20.]        FROST SPLITS      A common defect in standing timber results from radial splits  which extend inward from the periphery of the tree, and almost,  if not always, near the base. It is most common in trees which  split readily, and those with large rays and thin bark. The  primary cause of the splitting is frost, and various theories  have been advanced to explain the action.    R. Hartig[35] believes that freezing forces out a part of the  imbibition water of the cell walls, thereby causing the wood to  shrink, and if the interior layers have not yet been cooled,  tangential strains arise which finally produce radial clefts.    [Footnote 35: Hartig, R.: The diseases of trees (trans. by  Somerville and Ward), London and New York, 1894, pp. 282-294.]    Another theory holds that the water is not driven out of the  cell walls, but that difference in temperature conditions of  inner and outer layers is itself sufficient to set up the  strains, resulting in splitting. An air temperature of 14 deg.F. or  less is considered necessary to produce frost splits.    A still more recent theory is that of Busse[36] who considers  the mechanical action of the wind a very important factor. He  observed: (_a_) Frost splits sometimes occur at higher  temperatures than 14 deg.F. (_b_) Most splits take place shortly  before sunrise, _i.e._, at the time of lowest air and soil  temperature; they are never heard to take place at noon,  afternoon, or evening. (_c_) They always occur between two roots  or between the collars of two roots, (_d_) They are most  frequent in old, stout-rooted, broad-crowned trees; in younger  stands it is always the stoutest members that are found with  frost splits, while in quite young stands they are altogether  absent, (_e_) Trees on wet sites are most liable to splits, due  to difference in wood structure, just as difference in wood  structure makes different species vary in this regard. (_f_)  Frost splits are most numerous less than three feet above the  ground.    [Footnote 36: Busse, W.: Frost-, Ring- und Kernrisse. Forstwiss.  Centralb., XXXII, 2, 1910, pp. 74-81.]    When a tree is swayed by the wind the roots are counteracting  forces, and the wood fibres are tested in tension and  compression by"]]]
