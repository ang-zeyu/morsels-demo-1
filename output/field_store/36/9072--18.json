FOOTNOTES:      [1] \"Othello,\" the author of these two essays, was identified as a Negro  by Abbe Gregoire in his \"De la litterature des Negres.\"    [2] The writer refers here to the Convention of 1787 which framed the  Constitution of the United States.    [3] Here the writer has in mind the organization of the English Society  for the Abolition of the Slave Trade and the support given the cause by  Wilberforce, Pitt, Fox and Burke in England and by Brissot, Claviere and  Montmorin in France.    [4] Rhode Island had failed to ratify the Constitution of the United  States.    [5] During the first forty years of the republic there was much talk about  colonizing the Negroes in the West.    [6] The writer refers here to the acts of Pennsylvania, providing for the  abolition of slavery.    [7] In 1740 South Carolina enacted a law prohibiting any one from teaching  a slave to read or employing one in \"any manner of writing.\" Georgia  enacted the same law in 1770.    [8] This letter was originally published in England, where the number of  Negroes had considerably increased after the war in America.    [9] The country expression for the woods was \"Bush.\"          LETTERS SHOWING THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE EARLY NEGRO CHURCHES OF  GEORGIA AND THE WEST INDIES[1]      AN ACCOUNT OF SEVERAL BAPTIST CHURCHES, CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF NEGRO  SLAVES: PARTICULARLY OF ONE AT KINGSTON, IN JAMAICA; AND ANOTHER AT  SAVANNAH IN GEORGIA    A letter from the late Rev. Mr. Joseph Cook of the Euhaw, upper Indian  Land, South Carolina, bearing date Sept. 15, 1790, \"A poor negro, commonly  called, among his own friends, Brother George, has been so highly favoured  of God, as to plant the first Baptist Church in Savannah, and another in  Jamaica:\" This account produced an earnest desire to know the circumstances  of both these societies. Hence letters were written to the Rev. Mr. Cook at  the Euhaw; to Mr. Jonathan Clarke, at Savannah; to Mr. Wesley's people at  Kingston; with a view to obtain information, in which particular regard was  had to the _character_ of this poor but successful minister of Christ.  Satisfactory accounts have been received from each of these quarters, and a  letter from brother George himself, containing an answer to more than fifty  questions proposed in a letter to him: We presume to give an epitome of the  whole to our friends, hoping that they will have the goodness to let a  plain unlettered people convey their ideas in their own simple way.    Brother George's words are distinguished by inverted commas, and what is  not so marked, is either matter compressed or information received from  such persons to whom application has been made of it.    George Liele, called also George _Sharp_ because his owner's name was  Sharp, in a letter dated Kingston, Dec. 18, 1791, says, \"I was born in  Virginia, my father's name was Liele, and my mother's name Nancy; I can  not ascertain much of them, as I went to several parts of America when  young, and at length resided in New Georgia; but was informed both by  white and black people, that my father was the only black person who  knew the Lord in a spiritual way in that country: I always had a  natural fear of God from my youth, and was often checked in conscience  with thoughts of death, which barred me from many sins and bad company.  I knew no other way at that time to hope for salvation but only in the  performance of my good works.\" _About two years before the late war_,  \"the Rev. Mr. Matthew Moore,[2] one Sabbath afternoon, as I stood with  curiosity to hear him, he unfolded all my dark views, opened my best  behaviour and good works to me which I thought I was to be saved by, and  I was convinced that I was not in the way to heaven, but in the way to  hell. This state I laboured under for the space of five or six months.  The more I heard or read, the more I\" saw that I \"was condemned as a  sinner before God; till at length I was brought to perceive that my life  hung by a slender thread, and if it was the will of God to cut me off at  that time, I was sure I should be found in hell, as sure as God was in  Heaven. I saw my condemnation in my own heart, and I found no way  wherein I could escape the damnation of hell, only through the merits of  my dying Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; which caused me to make  intercession with Christ, for the salvation of my poor immortal soul;  and I full well recollect, I requested of my Lord and Master to give me  a work, I did not care how mean it was, only to try and see how good I  would do it.\" When he became acquainted with the method of salvation by  our Lord Jesus Christ, he soon found relief, particularly at a time when  he was earnestly engaged in prayer; yea, he says, \"I felt such love and  joy as my tongue was not able to express. After this I declared before  the congregation of believers the work which God had done for my soul,  and the same minister, the Rev. Matthew Moore, baptized me, and I  continued in this church about four years, till the vacuation\" of  Savannah by the British. When Mr. Liele was called by grace himself, he  was desirous of promoting the felicity of others. One who was an  eyewitness of it, says, _That he began to discover his love to other  negroes, on the same plantation with himself, by reading hymns among  them, encouraging them to sing, and sometimes by explaining the most  striking parts of them_. His own account is this, \"Desiring to prove the  sense I had of my obligations to God, I endeavoured to instruct\" the  people of \"my own color in the word of God: the white brethren seeing  my endeavours, and that the word of the Lord seemed to be blessed, gave  me a call at a quarterly meeting to preach before the congregation.\"  Afterwards Mr. Moore took the sense of the church concerning brother  Liele's abilities, when it appeared to be their unanimous opinion, \"that  he was possessed of ministerial gifts,\" and according to the custom  which obtains in some of the American churches, he was licensed as a  probationer. He now exercised at different plantations, especially on  those Lord's Day evenings when there was no service performed in the  church to which he belonged; and preached \"about three years at Brunton  land, and at Yamacraw,\" which last place is about half a mile from  Savannah. Mr. Henry Sharp, his master, being a deacon of the church  which called George Liele to the work of the ministry, some years before  his death gave him his freedom, only he continued in the family till his  master's exit. Mr. Sharp in the time of the war was an officer, and was  at last killed in the king's service, by a ball which shot off his hand.  The author of this account handled the bloody glove, which he wore when  he received the fatal wound. Some persons were at this time dissatisfied  with George's liberation, and threw him into prison, but by producing  the proper papers he was released; his particular friend in this  business was colonel Kirkland. \"At the vacuation of the country I was  partly obliged to come to Jamaica, as an indented servant, for money I  owed him, he promising to be my friend in this country. I was landed at  Kingston, and by the colonel's recommendation to general Campbell, the  governor of the Island, I was employed by him two years, and on leaving  the island, he gave me a written certificate from under his own hand of  my good behaviour. As soon as I had settled Col. Kirkland's demands on  me, I had a certificate of my freedom from the vestry and governor,  according to the act of this Island, both for myself and family.  Governor Campbell left the Island. I began, about September 1784, to  preach in Kingston, in a small private house, to a good smart  congregation, and I formed the church with four brethren from America  besides myself, and the preaching took very good effect with the poorer  sort, especially the slaves. The people at first persecuted us both at  meetings and baptisms, but, God be praised, they seldom interrupt us  now. We have applied to the Honourable House of Assembly, with a  petition of our distresses, being poor people, desiring to worship  Almighty God according to the tenets of the Bible, and they have granted  us liberty, and given us their sanction. Thanks be to God we have  liberty to worship him as we please in the Kingdom. You ask about those  who,\" in a judgment of charity, \"have been converted to Christ. I think  they are about four hundred and fifty. I have baptized four hundred in  Jamaica. At Kingston I baptize in the sea, at Spanish Town in the river,  and at convenient places in the country. We have nigh _three hundred and  fifty members_; a few white people among them, one white brother of the  first battalion of royals, from England, baptized by Rev. Thomas Davis.  Several members have been dismissed to other churches, and twelve have  died. I have sent enclosed\" an account of \"the conversion and death of  some. A few of Mr. Wesley's people, after immersion, join us and  continue with us. We have, together with well wishers and followers, in  different parts of the country, about fifteen hundred people. We receive  none into the church without a few lines from their owners of their good  behaviour towards them and religion. The Creoles of the country, after  they are converted and baptized, as God enables them, prove very  faithful. I have deacons and elders, a few; and teachers of small  congregations in the town and country, where convenience suits them to  come together; and I am pastor. I preach twice on the Lord's Day, in the  forenoon and afternoon, and twice in the week, and have not been absent  six Sabbath Days since I formed the church in this country. I receive  nothing for my services; I preach, baptize, administer the Lord's  Supper, and travel from one place to another to publish the gospel, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13643"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#16)"],[1,"in the following letters to  detect signs of a disturbed and desultory state of mind, wholly  foreign to his friend's nature. The riddle was soon solved.  Ferdinand's heart was touched for the first time, and perhaps because  the impression had been made late, it was all the deeper. Unfavorable  circumstances opposed themselves to his hopes: the young lady was  of an ancient family, rich, and betrothed since her childhood to a  relation, who was expected shortly to arrive in order to claim her  promised hand. Notwithstanding this engagement, Ferdinand and the  young girl had become sincerely attached to each other, and had  both resolved to dare everything with the hope of being united. They  pledged their troth in secret; the darkest mystery enveloped not only  their plans, but their affections; and as secrecy was necessary to  the advancement of their projects, Ferdinand entreated his friend to  forgive him if he did not intrust his whole secret to a sheet of paper  that had at least sixty miles to travel, and which must pass through  so many hands. It was impossible from his letter to guess the name of  the person or the place in question. \"You know that I love,\" he wrote,  \"therefore you know that the object of my secret passion is worthy  of any sacrifice; for you know your friend too well to believe him  capable of any blind infatuation, and this must suffice for the  present. No one must suspect what we are to each other; no one here or  round the neighborhood must have the slightest clew to our plans. An  awful personage will soon make his appearance among us. His violent  temper, his inveterate obstinacy, (according to all that one hears of  him,) are well calculated to confirm in _her_ a well-founded aversion.  But family arrangements and legal contracts exist, the fulfillment  of which the opposing party are bent on enforcing. The struggle will  be hard--perhaps unsuccessful; notwithstanding, I will strain every  nerve. Should I fail, you must console yourself, my dear Edward,  with the thought, that it will be no misfortune to your friend to  be deprived of an existence rendered miserable by the failure of his  dearest hopes, and separation from his dearest friend. Then may all  the happiness which Heaven has denied me be vouchsafed to you and her,  so that my spirit may look down contentedly from the realms of light,  and bless and protect you both.\"    Such was the usual tenor of the letters which Edward received during  that period, His heart was full of anxiety--he read danger and  distress in the mysterious communications of Ferdinand; and every  argument that affection and good sense could suggest did he make use  of, in his replies, to turn his friend from this path of peril which  threatened to end in a deep abyss. He tried persuasion, and urged him  to desist for the sake of their long-tried affection--but when did  passion ever listen to the expostulations of friendship?    Ferdinand only saw one aim in life--the possession of the beloved  one. All else faded from before his eyes, and even his correspondence  slackened, for his time was much taken up in secret excursions,  arrangements of all kinds, and communications with all manner of  persons; in fact every action of his present life tended to the  furtherance of his plan.    All of a sudden his letters ceased. Many posts passed without a sign  of life. Edward was a prey to the greatest anxiety; he thought his  friend had staked and lost. He imagined an elopement, a clandestine  marriage, a duel with a rival, and all these casualties were the more  painful to conjecture, since his entire ignorance of the real state  of things gave his fancy full range to conjure up all sorts of  misfortunes. At length, after many more posts had come in without a  line to pacify Edward's fears, without a word in reply to his earnest  entreaties for some news, he determined on taking a step which he had  meditated before, and only relinquished out of consideration for his  friend's wishes. He wrote to the officer commanding the regiment,  and made inquiries respecting the health and abode of Lieutenant Von  Hallberg, whose friends in the capital had remained for nearly two  months without news of him, he who had hitherto proved a regular and  frequent correspondent.    Another fortnight dragged heavily on, and at length the announcement  came in an official form. Lieutenant Von Hallberg had been invited  to the castle of a nobleman whom he was in the custom of visiting, in  order to be present at the wedding of a lady; that he was indisposed  at the time, that he grew worse, and on the third morning had been  found dead in his bed, having expired during the night from an attack  of apoplexy.    Edward could not finish the letter--it fell from his trembling hand.  To see his worst fears realized so suddenly, overwhelmed him at first.  His youth withstood the bodily illness which would have assailed a  weaker constitution, and perhaps mitigated the anguish of his grief.  He was not dangerously ill, but they feared many days for his reason;  and it required all the kind solicitude of the director of the  college, combined with the most skillful medical aid, to stem the  torrent of his sorrow, and to turn it gradually into a calmer channel,  until by degrees the mourner recovered both health and reason. His  youthful spirits, however, had received a blow from which they  never rebounded, and one thought lay heavy on his mind, which he was  unwilling to share with any other person, and which, on that account,  grew more and more painful. It was the memory of that holy promise  which had been mutually contracted, that the survivor was to receive  some token of his friend's remembrance of him after death. Now two  months had already passed since Ferdinand's earthly career had been  arrested, his spirit was free, why no sign? In the moment of death  Edward had had no intimation, no message from the passing spirit, and  this apparent neglect, so to speak, was another deep wound in Edward's  breast. Do the affections cease with life? Was it contrary to the will  of the Almighty that the mourner should taste this consolation? Did  individuality lose itself in death, and with it memory? Or did one  stroke destroy spirit and body? These anxious doubts, which have  before now agitated many who reflect on such subjects, exercised their  power over Edward's mind with an intensity that none can imagine save  one whose position is in any degree similar.    Time gradually deadened the intensity of his affliction. The violent  paroxysms of grief subsided into a deep but calm regret. It was as  if a mist had spread itself over every object which presented itself  before him, robbing them indeed of half their charms, yet leaving them  visible, and in their real relation to himself. During this mental  change the autumn arrived, and with it the long-expected commission.  It did not indeed occasion the joy which it might have done in former  days, when it would have led to a meeting with Ferdinand, or at  all events to a better chance of meeting, but it released him from  the thraldom of college, and it opened to him a welcome sphere of  activity. Now it so happened that his appointment led him accidentally  into the very neighborhood where Ferdinand had formerly resided, only  with this difference, that Edward's squadron was quartered in the  lowlands, about a short day's journey from the town and woodland  environs in question.    He proceeded to his quarters, and found an agreeable occupation in the  exercise of his new duties.    He had no wish to make acquaintances, yet he did not refuse the  invitations that were pressed upon him, lest he should he accused of  eccentricity and rudeness; and so be found himself soon entangled in  all sorts of engagements with the neighboring gentry and nobility. If  these so-called gayeties gave him no particular pleasure, at least for  the time they diverted his thoughts; and with this view he accepted  an invitation (for the new-year and carnival were near at hand) to  a great shooting-match which was to be held in the mountains--a spot  which it was possible to reach in one day, with favorable weather  and the roads in good state. The day was appointed, the air tolerably  clear; a mild frost had made the roads safe and even, and Edward had  every expectation of being able to reach Blumenberg in his sledge  before night, as on the following morning the match was to take place.  But as soon as he got near the mountains, where the sun retires so  early to rest, snow-clouds drove from all quarters, a cutting wind  came roaring through the ravines, and a heavy fall of snow began.  Twice the driver lost his way, and daylight was gone before he had  well recovered it; darkness came on sooner than in other places,  walled in as they were by dark mountains, with dark clouds above their  heads. It was out of the question to dream of reaching Blumenberg that  night; but in this hospitable land, where every householder welcomes  the passing traveler, Edward was under no anxiety as to shelter.  He only wished, before the night quite set in, to reach some  country-house or castle; and now that the storm had abated in some  degree, that the heavens were a little clearer, and that a few  stars peeped out, a large valley opened before them, whose bold  outline Edward could distinguish, even in the uncertain light. The  well-defined roofs of a neat village were perceptible, and behind  these, half-way up the mountain that crowned the plain, Edward thought  he could discern a large building which glimmered with more than one  light. The road led straight into the village. Edward stopped and  inquired.    That building was indeed a castle: the village belonged to it, and  both were the property of the Baron Friedenberg. \"Friedenberg!\"  repeated Edward: the name sounded familiar to him, yet he could not  call to mind when and where he had heard"]]]
