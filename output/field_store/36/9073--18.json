THE DONG WITH A LUMINOUS NOSE.    [Illustration]        When awful darkness and silence reign      Over the great Gromboolian plain,          Through the long, long wintry nights;      When the angry breakers roar      As they beat on the rocky shore;          When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights      Of the Hills of the Chankly Bore,--        Then, through the vast and gloomy dark      There moves what seems a fiery spark,--          A lonely spark with silvery rays          Piercing the coal-black night,--          A Meteor strange and bright:      Hither and thither the vision strays,          A single lurid light.        Slowly it wanders, pauses, creeps,--      Anon it sparkles, flashes, and leaps;      And ever as onward it gleaming goes      A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.      And those who watch at that midnight hour      From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,      Cry, as the wild light passes along,--         \"The Dong! the Dong!        The wandering Dong through the forest goes!          The Dong! the Dong!        The Dong with a luminous Nose!\"            Long years ago        The Dong was happy and gay,      Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl        Who came to those shores one day.      For the Jumblies came in a sieve, they did,--      Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd          Where the Oblong Oysters grow,        And the rocks are smooth and gray.      And all the woods and the valleys rang      With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang,--          \"_Far and few, far and few,            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;            Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,            And they went to sea in a sieve._\"        Happily, happily passed those days!        While the cheerful Jumblies staid;          They danced in circlets all night long,          To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong,        In moonlight, shine, or shade.      For day and night he was always there      By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair,      With her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;      Till the morning came of that hateful day      When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away,      And the Dong was left on the cruel shore      Gazing, gazing for evermore,--      Ever keeping his weary eyes on      That pea-green sail on the far horizon,--      Singing the Jumbly Chorus still      As he sate all day on the grassy hill,--          \"_Far and few, far and few,            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;            Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,            And they went to sea in a sieve_.\"        But when the sun was low in the West,          The Dong arose and said,--      \"What little sense I once possessed          Has quite gone out of my head!\"      And since that day he wanders still      By lake and forest, marsh and hill,      Singing, \"O somewhere, in valley or plain,      Might I find my Jumbly Girl again!      For ever I'll seek by lake and shore      Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more!\"            Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,          Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks;          And because by night he could not see,          He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree            On the flowery plain that grows.            And he wove him a wondrous Nose,--          A Nose as strange as a Nose could be!        Of vast proportions and painted red,      And tied with cords to the back of his head.    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#16)"],[1,"is really  what Attention is. The \"I\" wills that the mind be focused on some  particular object or thing, and the mind obeys and \"stretches toward\"  that object or thing, focusing its entire energy upon it, observing every  detail, dissecting, analyzing, consciously and sub-consciously, drawing  to itself every possible bit of information regarding it, both from  within and from without. We cannot lay too much stress upon the  acquirement of this great faculty, or rather, the development of it, for  it is necessary for the intelligent study of _Raja Yoga_.    In order to bring out the importance of the subject, suppose we start in  by actually giving our Attention to the subject of Attention, and see how  much more there is in it than we had thought. We shall be well repaid for  the amount of time and trouble expended upon it.    Attention has been defined as a focusing of consciousness, or, if one  prefers the form of expression, as \"detention in consciousness.\" In the  first case, we may liken it to the action of the sun-glass through which  the sun's rays are concentrated upon an object, the result being that the  heat is gathered together at a small given point, the intensity of the  same being raised many degrees until the heat is sufficient to burn a  piece of wood, or evaporate water. If the rays were not focused, the same  rays and heat would have been scattered over a large surface, and the  effect and power lessened. And so it is with the mind. If it is allowed  to scatter itself over the entire field of a subject, it will exert but  little power and the results will be weak. But if it is passed through  the sun-glass of attention, and focused first over one part, and then  over another, and so on, the matter may be mastered in detail, and a  result accomplished that will seem little less than marvelous to those  who do not know the secret.    _Thompson_ has said: \"The experiences most permanently impressed upon  consciousness, are those upon which the greatest amount of attention has  been fixed.\"    Another writer upon the subject has said that \"Attention is so  essentially necessary to understanding, that without some degree of it  the ideas and perceptions that pass through the mind seem to leave no  trace behind them.\"    _Hamilton_ has said: \"An act of attention, that is, an act of  concentration, seems thus necessary to every exertion of consciousness,  as a certain contraction of the pupil is requisite to every exertion of  vision. Attention then is to consciousness what the contraction of the  pupil is to sight, or, to the eye of the mind what the microscope or  telescope is to the bodily eye. It constitutes the better half of all  intellectual power.\"    And _Brodie_ adds, quite forcibly: \"It is Attention much more than any  difference in the abstract power of reasoning, which constitutes the vast  difference which exists between minds of different individuals.\"    _Butler_ gives us this important testimony: \"The most important  intellectual habit I know of is the habit of attending exclusively to the  matter in hand. It is commonly said that genius cannot be infused by  education, yet this power of concentrated attention, which belongs as a  part of his gift to every great discoverer, is unquestionably capable of  almost indefinite augmentation by resolute practice.\"    And, concluding this review of opinions, and endorsements of that which  the Yogis have so much to say, and to which they attach so much  importance, let us listen to the words of _Beattie_, who says: \"The  force wherewith anything strikes the mind, is generally in proportion to  the degree of attention bestowed upon it. Moreover, the great art of  memory is attention, and inattentive people always have bad memories.\"    There are two general kinds of Attention. The first is the Attention  directed within the mind upon mental objects and concepts. The other is  the Attention directed outward upon objects external to ourselves. The  same general rules and laws apply to both equally.    Likewise there may be drawn another distinction and division of attention  into two classes, _viz._, Attenion attracted by some impression coming  into consciousness without any conscious effort of the Will--this is  called Involuntary Attention, for the Attention and Interest is caught by  the attractiveness or novelty of the object. Attention directed to some  object by an effort of the Will, is called Voluntary Attention.  Involuntary Attention is quite common, and requires no special training.  In fact, the lower animals, and young children seem to have a greater  share of it than do adult men. A great percentage of men and women never  get beyond this stage to any marked degree. On the other hand, Voluntary  Attention requires effort, will, and determination--a certain mental  training, that is beyond the majority of people, for they will not \"take  the trouble\" to direct their attention in this way. Voluntary Attention  is the mark of the student and other thoughtful men. They focus their  minds on objects that do not yield immediate interest or pleasure, in  order that they may learn and accomplish. The careless person will not  thus fasten his Attention, at least not more than a moment or so, for his  Involuntary Attention is soon attracted by some passing object of no  matter how trifling a nature, and the Voluntary Attention disappears and  is forgotten. Voluntary Attention is developed by practice and  perseverance, and is well worth the trouble, for nothing in the mental  world is accomplished without its use.    The Attention does not readily fasten itself to uninteresting objects,  and, unless interest can be created it requires a considerable degree of  Voluntary Attention in order that the mind may be fastened upon such an  object. And, more than this, even if the ordinary attention is attracted  it will soon waver, unless there is some interesting change in the aspect  of the object, that will give the attention a fresh hold of interest, or  unless some new quality, characteristic or property manifests itself in  the object. This fact occurs because the mind mechanism has not been  trained to bear prolonged Voluntary Attention, and, in fact, the physical  brain is not accustomed to the task, although it may be so trained by  patient practice.    It has been noticed by investigators that the Attention may be rested and  freshened, either by withdrawing the Voluntary Attention from the object,  and allowing the Attention to manifest along Involuntary lines toward  passing objects, etc.; or, on the other hand, by directing the Voluntary  Attention into a new field of observation--toward some new object.  Sometimes one plan will seem to give the best results, and again the  other will seem preferable.    We have called your attention to the fact that Interest develops  Attention, and holds it fixed, while an uninteresting object or subject  requires a much greater effort and application. This fact is apparent to  anyone. A common illustration may be found in the matter of reading a  book. Nearly everyone will give his undivided attention to some bright,  thrilling story, while but few are able to use sufficient Voluntary  Attention to master the pages of some scientific work. But, right here,  we wish to call your attention to the other side of the case, which is  another example of the fact that Truth is composed of paradoxes.    Just as Interest develops Attention, so it is a truth that Attention  develops Interest. If one will take the trouble to give a little  Voluntary Attention to an object, he will soon find that a little  perseverance will bring to light points of Interest in the object. Things  before unseen and unsuspected, are quickly brought to light. And many new  phases, and aspects of the subject or object are seen, each one of which,  in turn, becomes an object of Interest. This is a fact not so generally  known, and one that it will be well for you to remember, and to use in  practice. _Look_ for the interesting features of an uninteresting thing,  and they will appear to your view, and before long the uninteresting  object will have changed into a thing having many-sided interests.    Voluntary Attention is one of the signs of a developed Will. That is, of  a mind that has been well trained by the Will, for the Will is always  strong, and it is the mind that has to be trained, not the Will. And on  the other hand, one of the best ways to train the mind by the Will, is by  practice in Voluntary Attention. So you see how the rule works both ways.  Some Western psychologists have even advanced theories that the Voluntary  Attention is the _only_ power of the Will, and that that power is  sufficient, for if the Attention be firmly fixed, and held upon an object  the mind will \"do the rest.\" We do not agree with this school of  philosophers, but merely mention the fact as an illustration of the  importance attributed by psychologists to this matter of Voluntary  Attention.    A man of a strongly developed Attention often accomplishes far more than  some much brighter man who lacks it. Voluntary Attention and Application  is a very good substitute for Genius, and often accomplishes far more in  the long run.    Voluntary Attention is the fixing of the mind earnestly and intently upon  some particular object, at the same time shutting out from consciousness  other objects pressing for entrance. _Hamilton_ has defined it as  \"consciousness voluntarily applied under its law of limitations to some  determinate object.\" The same writer goes on to state that \"the greater  the number of objects to which our consciousness is simultaneously  extended, the smaller is the intensity with which it is able to consider  each, and consequently the less vivid and distinct will be the  information it contains of the several objects. When our interest in any  particular object is excited, and when we wish to obtain all the  knowledge "]]]
