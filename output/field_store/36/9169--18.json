There is, indeed, a small area of low trees and  scrub near the right bank of the Tugela a few hundred yards on the right  front of the line of guns, but there is no evidence that the Boers had  ever crossed the river to hold it.    When the field guns, after firing nearly 100 rounds each, became silent,  Buller, who was already perturbed by Hart's discomfiture, jumped to the  conclusion that they were exterminated, and that it would be useless to  proceed with the attack without them; but the gunners were only waiting  for more ammunition. Not until the following day did he know that men  enough to fight the guns were still untouched. If the whole of his force  had been seriously engaged he would perhaps have been justified in his  decision not to hold on to Colenso with exhausted and parched troops in  the burning heat of the South African midsummer in the hope of rescuing  the guns at night; but several battalions had been doing little more  than watching the fight during the morning, and he might have left them  on the field; and it is clear from a telegram sent by Botha early in the  afternoon that if the Naval battery had remained with an effective  infantry support no attempt would have been made by the Boers to cross  the river, and that the guns would not have been lost.    The repulse at Colenso staggered Buller's humanity. He was a brave man  on the right of whose many war medals hung the Victoria Cross which he  had won not far away from the field on which he was now fighting; but he  was lacking in bull-dog tenacity, and in the ascetic temperament which  is quickened rather than disheartened by failure. He returned to his  tent, wrung his hands, and announced to those whom it might concern that  all was lost. In the telegram in which he reported his defeat to Lord  Lansdowne and of which the frankness, the candour, and the copious yet  not egotistical use of the first personal pronoun were in curious  contrast to the formal and sterilized paragraphs of an official account,  he confessed that with the force at his disposal he had little hope of  relieving Ladysmith and he proposed that he should let it go. He ordered  the staff to select a defensive line eastward from Estcourt which his  army might occupy until the end of the hot season.    His message to White in Ladysmith was still more pessimistic, and with  an intention that was chivalrous but was not war he \"spatchcocked\"[25]  into it a suggestion that White should surrender, and even indicated how  the gain to the enemy could be minimised. The magnanimity of Buller was  manifest: he desired to give White the opportunity of surrendering  without incurring the full responsibility for the act, but the lack of  military instinct in Buller's mind was likewise manifest. To this  message, which was suspected in Ladysmith to have originated in the Boer  laagers, White replied that he had no intention of surrendering.    Nor did Buller's pessimism turn the Home Government from its purpose. He  was ordered to hold on, and on December 17 Lord Roberts accepted the  chief command in South Africa. In announcing the appointment, the War  Office explained that Buller was superseded because it was advisable to  relieve him of responsibility for the operations outside Natal, which he  could not effectively control from his detached position on the right  flank. The Vth Division under Sir C. Warren which had been ordered at  his request a month before, and which he found was available for service  on the Natal side, was on the point of landing in South Africa; the VIth  Division was embarking at home; the components of a VIIth Division were  being assembled, and he became less despondent.    The War Office thought that the Magersfontein mishap called for the  supersession of Methuen, and when Warren reached Capetown with the Vth  Division he found orders from home directing him to assume command of  the force at Modder River. It would probably have been better for Buller  if he had freely acquiesced in the idea of Pall Mall and had allowed  Warren, but not necessarily the Vth Division, to operate in a country  with which he had become acquainted twenty years before in the  Bechuanaland Expedition, but he could not foresee Spion Kop; and Warren  while moving towards the Orange was suddenly recalled to Capetown and  ordered to reinforce the Army of Natal with the Vth Division; and  Methuen was allowed to retain his command at Modder River.    The transfer of the Vth Division to Natal was undoubtedly called for;  but the position in the districts of Cape Colony bordering on the Free  State was alarming. A belt extending from Barkly East near the Basuto  border westwards and northwards as far as the Molopo River, and  interrupted only near the Orange and Modder Rivers, had been annexed by  the Boers and was more or less effectively occupied by them; and had  they acted with enterprise and concurrence during the period of Lord  Roberts' journey from England, the task before the new  Commander-in-Chief would have been still more formidable. In rear of  French and Gatacre was an indefinite area through which ran the British  lines of communication, and which, if not indeed actually under arms,  was ready to spring up whenever a favourable opportunity presented  itself.    Of the four Generals set to stem the tide of war until the arrival of  Lord Roberts, French alone did not restrict himself to restraining its  flow. A policy of \"worry without risk\" had been recommended to him by  Buller, and he carried it out with good effect. He thrust Schoeman out  of Arundel and Rensburg, and occupied a commanding position outside  Colesberg, which he maintained until he was summoned on January 29 to  confer with Lord Roberts at Capetown, where he was confidentially  informed of the plan of campaign. Clements, who a few weeks before had  reinforced him with a brigade of the recently landed VIth Division under  Kelly-Kenny, took over the command of the troops before Colesberg. But  the force which he had to his hand had been considerably reduced by the  withdrawal of the cavalry and nearly half the infantry to serve  elsewhere, while Schoeman and Delarey, who had come from Magersfontein,  had been strongly reinforced.    The Boers doubted not that the positions taken up by Gatacre and French  indicated that the impending advance of the British Army into the Free  State would be by way of Bethulie and Norval's Pont, and were  accordingly disposing all their available men, one commando even being  sent to Colesberg from Natal; but fortunately they were at first unaware  that Clements had been almost simultaneously weakened. He soon found  that he was not strong enough to hold on to the Colesberg positions and  on February 14 retired to Arundel; losing on the way two companies of  infantry which had been mislaid and forgotten and which after a gallant  running fight of three miles were captured.    But now ominous reports of Lord Roberts' movements in the West began to  come in, and the Boers realized that they had misinterpreted the signs  which had been so ostentatiously displayed. They hesitated and wavered,  and on February 20 hurried away from Colesberg to succour Cronje and the  threatened capital of the Free State.    Notes:    [Footnote 19: Buller aroused a \"now-we-shan't-be-long\" feeling. He would  certainly be in Pretoria by Christmas. It is said that a large number of  plum-puddings intended for the soldiers' dinners on December 25 were  addressed to Pretoria \"to await arrival,\" by their good friends at  home.]    [Footnote 20: The history of the war showed, however, that generally the  Boers fought more strenuously and effectively when the tide was against  them than when it was flowing with them.]    [Footnote 21: The two chief authorities on the events of the day are not  in agreement as to which of the iron bridges was meant; and in the  absence of information of what was in the mind of the staff officer who  drew up the battle orders the question cannot be answered. The context  and certain expressions in other paragraphs seem to show that the  railway bridge was indicated. It was, indeed, broken but there were  drifts used by the natives above and below it. Probably the river had  not been carefully reconnoitred and the two bridges were confused, or  one only was believed to exist.]    [Footnote 22: At the battle of Omdurman he had put short range  principles successfully into practice against dervishes.]    [Footnote 23: The mistake in Hart's map is shown by a broken line in the  sketch map. It is, curiously enough, reproduced in the Colenso map not  only of the _Times_ History, but also of the German Official Report on  the War.]    [Footnote 24: See _Combined Training_, 1905, p. 109.]    [Footnote 25: _Sic_ in his speech of October 10, 1901, but he probably  meant \"sandwiched.\"]          CHAPTER IV    Kimberley and the Siege of Rhodes      More than thirty years before the outbreak of the Second Boer War a  Dutch child in the Hopetown District of Cape Colony found, while playing  carelessly near the left bank of the Orange, a pretty pebble that was  destined to mould the History of South Africa.    He took the bagatelle home to his father's farm, where a neighbour, one  Van Niekirk, saw it and was struck by its brilliancy. It chanced that  the Irishman O'Reilly was passing that way and to him it was entrusted  to take to Colesberg for expert opinion upon its value. Here certain  Jews declared that it was but a white topaz not worth one shilling and  it was disdainfully cast out into the road, from which it was with  difficulty recovered by O'R"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#16)"],[1,".  (At least, he ought to have  stood patiently, but he kept wandering off and getting mixed with 'R's'  and 'S's' and all sorts of letters.) I found him a very difficult  guest; he was sulky because he had only three dances with me.  He said  he was bashful about dancing with girls he didn't know!    The next morning we had a glee club concert--and who do you think wrote  the funny new song composed for the occasion?  It's the truth.  She  did.  Oh, I tell you, Daddy, your little foundling is getting to be  quite a prominent person!    Anyway, our gay two days were great fun, and I think the men enjoyed  it.  Some of them were awfully perturbed at first at the prospect of  facing one thousand girls; but they got acclimated very quickly.  Our  two Princeton men had a beautiful time--at least they politely said  they had, and they've invited us to their dance next spring.  We've  accepted, so please don't object, Daddy dear.    Julia and Sallie and I all had new dresses.  Do you want to hear about  them?  Julia's was cream satin and gold embroidery and she wore purple  orchids.  It was a DREAM and came from Paris, and cost a million  dollars.    Sallie's was pale blue trimmed with Persian embroidery, and went  beautifully with red hair.  It didn't cost quite a million, but was  just as effective as Julia's.    Mine was pale pink crepe de chine trimmed with ecru lace and rose  satin.  And I carried crimson roses which J. McB.  sent (Sallie having  told him what colour to get). And we all had satin slippers and silk  stockings and chiffon scarfs to match.    You must be deeply impressed by these millinery details.    One can't help thinking, Daddy, what a colourless life a man is forced  to lead, when one reflects that chiffon and Venetian point and hand  embroidery and Irish crochet are to him mere empty words.  Whereas a  woman--whether she is interested in babies or microbes or husbands or  poetry or servants or parallelograms or gardens or Plato or bridge--is  fundamentally and always interested in clothes.    It's the one touch of nature that makes the whole world kin.  (That  isn't original.  I got it out of one of Shakespeare's plays).    However, to resume.  Do you want me to tell you a secret that I've  lately discovered?  And will you promise not to think me vain?  Then  listen:    I'm pretty.    I am, really.  I'd be an awful idiot not to know it with three  looking-glasses in the room.                                               A Friend      PS.  This is one of those wicked anonymous letters you read about in  novels.                                                       20th December    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I've just a moment, because I must attend two classes, pack a trunk and  a suit-case, and catch the four-o'clock train--but I couldn't go  without sending a word to let you know how much I appreciate my  Christmas box.    I love the furs and the necklace and the Liberty scarf and the gloves  and handkerchiefs and books and purse--and most of all I love you!  But  Daddy, you have no business to spoil me this way.  I'm only human--and  a girl at that.  How can I keep my mind sternly fixed on a studious  career, when you deflect me with such worldly frivolities?    I have strong suspicions now as to which one of the John Grier Trustees  used to give the Christmas tree and the Sunday ice-cream.  He was  nameless, but by his works I know him!  You deserve to be happy for all  the good things you do.    Goodbye, and a very merry Christmas.                                   Yours always,                                                 Judy      PS.  I am sending a slight token, too.  Do you think you would like her  if you knew her?                                                         11th January    I meant to write to you from the city, Daddy, but New York is an  engrossing place.    I had an interesting--and illuminating--time, but I'm glad I don't  belong to such a family!  I should truly rather have the John Grier  Home for a background.  Whatever the drawbacks of my bringing up, there  was at least no pretence about it.  I know now what people mean when  they say they are weighed down by Things.  The material atmosphere of  that house was crushing; I didn't draw a deep breath until I was on an  express train coming back.  All the furniture was carved and  upholstered and gorgeous; the people I met were beautifully dressed and  low-voiced and well-bred, but it's the truth, Daddy, I never heard one  word of real talk from the time we arrived until we left.  I don't  think an idea ever entered the front door.    Mrs. Pendleton never thinks of anything but jewels and dressmakers and  social engagements.  She did seem a different kind of mother from Mrs.  McBride!  If I ever marry and have a family, I'm going to make them as  exactly like the McBrides as I can.  Not for all the money in the world  would I ever let any children of mine develop into Pendletons.  Maybe  it isn't polite to criticize people you've been visiting?  If it isn't,  please excuse.  This is very confidential, between you and me.    I only saw Master Jervie once when he called at tea time, and then I  didn't have a chance to speak to him alone.  It was really  disappointing after our nice time last summer.  I don't think he cares  much for his relatives--and I am sure they don't care much for him!  Julia's mother says he's unbalanced.  He's a Socialist--except, thank  Heaven, he doesn't let his hair grow and wear red ties.  She can't  imagine where he picked up his queer ideas; the family have been Church  of England for generations.  He throws away his money on every sort of  crazy reform, instead of spending it on such sensible things as yachts  and automobiles and polo ponies.  He does buy candy with it though!  He  sent Julia and me each a box for Christmas.    You know, I think I'll be a Socialist, too.  You wouldn't mind, would  you, Daddy?  They're quite different from Anarchists; they don't  believe in blowing people up.  Probably I am one by rights; I belong to  the proletariat.  I haven't determined yet just which kind I am going  to be.  I will look into the subject over Sunday, and declare my  principles in my next.    I've seen loads of theatres and hotels and beautiful houses.  My mind  is a confused jumble of onyx and gilding and mosaic floors and palms.  I'm still pretty breathless but I am glad to get back to college and my  books--I believe that I really am a student; this atmosphere of  academic calm I find more bracing than New York.  College is a very  satisfying sort of life; the books and study and regular classes keep  you alive mentally, and then when your mind gets tired, you have the  gymnasium and outdoor athletics, and always plenty of congenial friends  who are thinking about the same things you are.  We spend a whole  evening in nothing but talk--talk--talk--and go to bed with a very  uplifted feeling, as though we had settled permanently some pressing  world problems.  And filling in every crevice, there is always such a  lot of nonsense--just silly jokes about the little things that come up  but very satisfying.  We do appreciate our own witticisms!    It isn't the great big pleasures that count the most; it's making a  great deal out of the little ones--I've discovered the true secret of  happiness, Daddy, and that is to live in the now.  Not to be for ever  regretting the past, or anticipating the future; but to get the most  that you can out of this very instant.  It's like farming.  You can  have extensive farming and intensive farming; well, I am going to have  intensive living after this.  I'm going to enjoy every second, and I'm  going to KNOW I'm enjoying it while I'm enjoying it.  Most people don't  live; they just race.  They are trying to reach some goal far away on  the horizon, and in the heat of the going they get so breathless and  panting that they lose all sight of the beautiful, tranquil country  they are passing through; and then the first thing they know, they are  old and worn out, and it doesn't make any difference whether they've  reached the goal or not.  I've decided to sit down by the way and pile  up a lot of little happinesses, even if I never become a Great Author.  Did you ever know such a philosopheress as I am developing into?                                       Yours ever,                                                     Judy    PS.  It's raining cats and dogs tonight.  Two puppies and a kitten have  just landed on the window-sill.          Dear Comrade,    Hooray!  I'm a Fabian.    That's a Socialist who's willing to wait.  We don't want the social  revolution to come tomorrow morning; it would be too upsetting.  We  want it to come very gradually in the distant future, when we shall all  be prepared and able to sustain the shock.    In the meantime, we must be getting ready, by instituting industrial,  educational and orphan asylum reforms.                   Yours, with fraternal love,                                                 Judy    Monday, 3rd hour                                                             11th February  Dear D.-L.-L.,    Don't be insulted because this is so short.  It isn't a letter; it's  just a LINE to say that I'm going to write a letter pretty soon when  examinations are over.  It is not only necessary that I pass, but pass  WELL.  I have a scholarship to live up to.                           Yours, studying hard,                                                 J. A.                                                             5th March    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    President Cuyler made a speech this evening about the modern generation  being flippant and superficial.  He says that we are losing the old  ideals of earnest endeavour and true scholarship; and particularly is  this falling-off noticeable in our disrespectful attitude towards  organized authority.  We no longer pay a seemly deference to our  superiors.    I "]]]
