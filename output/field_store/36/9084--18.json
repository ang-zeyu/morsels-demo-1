Now, this man had an artificial foot, and he evidently  distrusted his knee-joint, as is shown by his steadying it with his  stick on the same side. If he had merely had a weak leg, he would have  used the stick with his right hand--with the natural swing of the arm,  in fact--unless he had been very lame, which he evidently was not.  Still, it was only a question of probability, though the probability was  very great. Of course, you understand that those particles of woody  fibre and starch granules were disintegrated snuff-grains.\"    This explanation, like the others, was quite simple when one had heard  it, though it gave me material for much thought as we pedalled on along  the dark road, with Thorndyke's light flickering in front, and the  dogcart pattering in our wake. But there was ample time for reflection;  for our pace rather precluded conversation, and we rode on, mile after  mile, until my legs ached with fatigue. On and on we went through  village after village, now losing the trail in some frequented street,  but picking it up again unfailingly as we emerged on to the country  road, until at last, in the paved High Street of the little town of  Horsefield, we lost it for good. We rode on through the town out on to  the country road; but although there were several tracks of motors,  Thorndyke shook his head at them all. \"I have been studying those tyres  until I know them by heart,\" he said. \"No; either he is in the town, or  he has left it by a side road.\"    There was nothing for it but to put up the horse and the machines at the  hotel, while we walked round to reconnoitre; and this we did, tramping  up one street and down another, with eyes bent on the ground,  fruitlessly searching for a trace of the missing car.    Suddenly, at the door of a blacksmith's shop, Thorndyke halted. The shop  had been kept open late for the shoeing of a carriage horse, which was  just being led away, and the smith had come to the door for a breath of  air. Thorndyke accosted him genially.    \"Good-evening. You are just the man I wanted to see. I have mislaid the  address of a friend of mine, who, I think, called on you this  afternoon--a lame gentleman who walks with a stick. I expect he wanted  you to pick a lock or make him a key.\"    \"Oh, I remember him!\" said the man. \"Yes, he had lost his latchkey, and  wanted the lock picked before he could get into his house. Had to leave  his motor-car outside while he came here. But I took some keys round  with me, and fitted one to his latch.\"    He then directed us to a house at the end of a street close by, and,  having thanked him, we went off in high spirits.    \"How did you know he had been there?\" I asked.    \"I didn't; but there was the mark of a stick and part of a left foot on  the soft earth inside the doorway, and the thing was inherently  probable, so I risked a false shot.\"    The house stood alone at the far end of a straggling street, and was  enclosed by a high wall, in which, on the side facing the street, was a  door and a wide carriage-gate. Advancing to the former, Thorndyke took  from his pocket the purloined key, and tried it in the lock. It fitted  perfectly, and when he had turned it and pushed open the door, we  entered a small courtyard. Crossing this, we came to the front door of  the house, the latch of which fortunately fitted the same key; and this  having been opened by Thorndyke, we trooped into the hall. Immediately  we heard the sound of an opening door above, and a reedy, nasal voice  sang out:    \"Hello, there! Who's that below?\"    The voice was followed by the appearance of a head projecting over the  baluster rail.    \"You are Mr. Percy Haldean, I think,\" said the inspector.    At the mention of this name, the head was withdrawn, and a quick tread  was heard, accompanied by the tapping of a stick on the floor. We  started to ascend the stairs, the inspector leading, as the authorized  official; but we had only gone up a few steps, when a fierce, wiry  little man danced out on to the landing, with a thick stick in one  hand and a very large revolver in the other.    \"Move another step, either of you,\" he shouted, pointing the weapon at  the inspector, \"and I let fly; and mind you, when I shoot I hit.\"    [Illustration: THE STRANGER IS RUN TO EARTH.]    He looked as if he meant it, and we accordingly halted with remarkable  suddenness, while the inspector proceeded to parley.    \"Now, what's the good of this, Mr. Haldean?\" said he. \"The game's up,  and you know it.\"    \"You clear out of my house, and clear out sharp,\" was the inhospitable  rejoinder, \"or you'll give me the trouble of burying you in the garden.\"    I looked round to consult with Thorndyke, when, to my amazement, I found  that he had vanished--apparently through the open hall-door. I was  admiring his discretion when the inspector endeavoured to reopen  negotiations, but was cut short abruptly.    \"I am going to count fifty,\" said Mr. Haldean, \"and if you aren't gone  then, I shall shoot.\"    He began to count deliberately, and the inspector looked round at me in  complete bewilderment. The flight of stairs was a long one, and well  lighted by gas, so that to rush it was an impossibility. Suddenly my  heart gave a bound and I held my breath, for out of an open door behind  our quarry, a figure emerged slowly and noiselessly on to the landing.  It was Thorndyke, shoeless, and in his shirt-sleeves.    Slowly and with cat-like stealthiness, he crept across the landing until  he was within a yard of the unconscious fugitive, and still the nasal  voice droned on, monotonously counting out the allotted seconds.    \"Forty-one, forty-two, forty-three--\"    There was a lightning-like movement--a shout--a flash--a bang--a shower  of falling plaster, and then the revolver came clattering down the  stairs. The inspector and I rushed up, and in a moment the sharp click  of the handcuffs told Mr. Percy Haldean that the game was really up.           *       *       *       *       *    Five minutes later Freddy-boy, half asleep, but wholly cheerful, was  borne on Thorndyke's shoulders into the private sitting-room of the  Black Horse Hotel. A shriek of joy saluted his entrance, and a shower of  maternal kisses brought him to the verge of suffocation. Finally, the  impulsive Mrs. Haldean, turning suddenly to Thorndyke, seized both his  hands, and for a moment I hoped that she was going to kiss him, too. But  he was spared, and I have not yet recovered from the disappointment.          III    THE ANTHROPOLOGIST AT LARGE      Thorndyke was not a newspaper reader. He viewed with extreme disfavour  all scrappy and miscellaneous forms of literature, which, by presenting  a disorderly series of unrelated items of information, tended, as he  considered, to destroy the habit of consecutive mental effort.    \"It is most important,\" he once remarked to me, \"habitually to pursue a  definite train of thought, and to pursue it to a finish, instead of  flitting indolently from one uncompleted topic to another, as the  newspaper reader is so apt to do. Still, there is no harm in a daily  paper--so long as you don't read it.\"    Accordingly, he patronized a morning paper, and his method of dealing  with it was characteristic. The paper was laid on the table after  breakfast, together with a blue pencil and a pair of office shears. A  preliminary glance through the sheets enabled him to mark with the  pencil those paragraphs that were to be read, and these were presently  cut out and looked through, after which they were either thrown away or  set aside to be pasted in an indexed book.    The whole proceeding occupied, on an average, a quarter of an hour.    On the morning of which I am now speaking he was thus engaged. The  pencil had done its work, and the snick of the shears announced the  final stage. Presently he paused with a newly-excised cutting between  his fingers, and, after glancing at it for a moment, he handed it to me.    \"Another art robbery,\" he remarked. \"Mysterious affairs, these--as to  motive, I mean. You can't melt down a picture or an ivory carving, and  you can't put them on the market as they stand. The very qualities that  give them their value make them totally unnegotiable.\"    \"Yet I suppose,\" said I, \"the really inveterate collector--the pottery  or stamp maniac, for instance--will buy these contraband goods even  though he dare not show them.\"    \"Probably. No doubt the _cupiditas habendi_, the mere desire to possess,  is the motive force rather than any intelligent purpose--\"    The discussion was at this point interrupted by a knock at the door, and  a moment later my colleague admitted two gentlemen. One of these I  recognized as a Mr. Marchmont, a solicitor, for whom we had occasionally  acted; the other was a stranger--a typical Hebrew of the blonde  type--good-looking, faultlessly dressed, carrying a bandbox, and  obviously in a state of the most extreme agitation.    \"Good-morning to you, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Marchmont, shaking hands  cordially. \"I have brought a client of mine to see you, and when I tell  you that his name is Solomon Loewe, it will be unnecessary for me to say  what our business is.\"    \"Oddly enough,\" replied Thorndyke, \"we were, at the very moment when you  knocked, discussing the bearings of his case.\"    \"It is a horrible affair!\" burst in Mr. Loewe. \"I am distracted! I am  ruined! I am in despair!\"    He banged the bandbox down on the table, and flinging himself into a  chair, buried his face in his hands.    \"Come, come,\" remonstrated Marchmont, \"we must be brave, we must be  composed. Tell Dr. Thorndyke your story, and let us hear what he thinks  of it.\"    He leaned back in his chair, and looked at his client with that air of  patient fortitude that comes to us all so easily when we contemplate the  misfortunes of other people.    \"You must help us, sir,\" exclaimed Loewe, starting up again--\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#16)"],[1," but       noble and real; and on my part I am of a sure ground that I have       committed nothing that may deserve alteration. And therefore my       hope is your Lordship will finish a good work, and consider that       time groweth precious with me, and that I am now _vergentibus       annis_. And although I know your fortune is not to need an hundred       such as I am, yet I shall be ever ready to give you my best and       first fruits, and to supply (as much as in me lieth) worthiness by       thankfulness.\"    Still the powers were deaf to his appeals; at any rate he had to be  content with another promise. Considering the ability which he had shown  in Parliament, the wisdom and zeal with which he had supported the  Government, and the important position which he held in the House of  Commons, the neglect of him is unintelligible, except on two  suppositions: that the Government, that is Cecil, were afraid of  anything but the mere routine of law, as represented by such men as  Hobart and Doddridge; or that Coke's hostility to him was unabated, and  Coke still too important to be offended.    Bacon returned to work when the Parliament met, November, 1606. The  questions arising out of the Union, the question of naturalisation, its  grounds and limits, the position of Scotchmen born _before_ or _since_  the King's accession, the _Antenati_ and _Postnati_, the question of a  union of laws, with its consequences, were discussed with great keenness  and much jealous feeling. On the question of naturalisation Bacon took  the liberal and larger view. The immediate union of laws he opposed as  premature. He was a willing servant of the House, and the House readily  made use of him. He reported the result of conferences, even when his  own opinion was adverse to that of the House. And he reported the  speeches of such persons as Lord Salisbury, probably throwing into them  both form and matter of his own. At length, \"silently, on the 25th of  June,\" 1607, he was appointed Solicitor-General. He was then  forty-seven.    \"It was also probably about this time,\" writes Mr. Spedding, \"that Bacon  finally settled the plan of his '_Great Instauration_,' and began to  call it by that name.\"          CHAPTER IV.    BACON SOLICITOR-GENERAL.      The great thinker and idealist, the great seer of a world of knowledge  to which the men of his own generation were blind, and which they could  not, even with his help, imagine a possible one, had now won the first  step in that long and toilsome ascent to success in life, in which for  fourteen years he had been baffled. He had made himself, for good and  for evil, a servant of the Government of James I. He was prepared to  discharge with zeal and care all his duties. He was prepared to perform  all the services which that Government might claim from its servants. He  had sought, he had passionately pressed to be admitted within that  circle in which the will of the King was the supreme law; after that, it  would have been ruin to have withdrawn or resisted. But it does not  appear that the thought or wish to resist or withdraw ever presented  itself; he had thoroughly convinced himself that in doing what the King  required he was doing the part of a good citizen, and a faithful servant  of the State and Commonwealth. The two lives, the two currents of  purpose and effort, were still there. Behind all the wrangle of the  courts and the devising of questionable legal subtleties to support some  unconstitutional encroachment, or to outflank the defence of some  obnoxious prisoner, the high philosophical meditations still went on;  the remembrance of their sweetness and grandeur wrung more than once  from the jaded lawyer or the baffled counsellor the complaint, in words  which had a great charm for him, _Multum incola fuit anima mea_--\"My  soul hath long dwelt\" where it would not be. But opinion and ambition  and the immense convenience of being great and rich and powerful, and  the supposed necessities of his condition, were too strong even for his  longings to be the interpreter and the servant of nature. There is no  trace of the faintest reluctance on his part to be the willing minister  of a court of which not only the principal figure, but the arbiter and  governing spirit, was to be George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham.    The first leisure that Bacon had after he was appointed Solicitor he  used in a characteristic way. He sat down to make a minute stock-taking  of his position and its circumstances. In the summer of 1608 he devoted  a week of July to this survey of his life, its objects and its  appliances; and he jotted down, day by day, through the week, from his  present reflections, or he transcribed from former note-books, a series  of notes in loose order, mostly very rough and not always intelligible,  about everything that could now concern him. This curious and intimate  record, which he called _Commentarius Solutus_, was discovered by Mr.  Spedding, who not unnaturally had some misgivings about publishing so  secret and so ambiguous a record of a man's most private confidences  with himself. But there it was, and, as it was known, he no doubt  decided wisely in publishing it as it stands; he has done his best to  make it intelligible, and he has also done his best to remove any  unfavourable impressions that might arise from it. It is singularly  interesting as an evidence of Bacon's way of working, of his  watchfulness, his industry, his care in preparing himself long  beforehand for possible occasions, his readiness to take any amount of  trouble about his present duties, his self-reliant desire for more  important and difficult ones. It exhibits his habit of self-observation  and self-correction, his care to mend his natural defects of voice,  manner, and delivery; it is even more curious in showing him watching  his own physical constitution and health, in the most minute details of  symptoms and remedies, equally with a scientific and a practical object.  It contains his estimate of his income, his expenditure, his debts,  schedules of lands and jewels, his rules for the economy of his estate,  his plans for his new gardens and terraces and ponds and buildings at  Gorhambury. He was now a rich man, valuing his property at L24,155 and  his income at L4975, burdened with a considerable debt, but not more  than he might easily look to wipe out. But, besides all these points,  there appear the two large interests of his life--the reform of  philosophy, and his ideal of a great national policy. The \"greatness of  Britain\" was one of his favourite subjects of meditation. He puts down  in his notes the outline of what should be aimed at to secure and  increase it; it is to make the various forces of the great and growing  empire work together in harmonious order, without waste, without  jealousy, without encroachment and collision; to unite not only the  interests but the sympathies and aims of the Crown with those of the  people and Parliament; and so to make Britain, now in peril from nothing  but from the strength of its own discordant elements, that \"Monarchy of  the West\" in reality, which Spain was in show, and, as Bacon always  maintained, only in show. The survey of the condition of his  philosophical enterprise takes more space. He notes the stages and  points to which his plans have reached; he indicates, with a favourite  quotation or apophthegm--\"_Plus ultra_\"--\"_ausus vana  contemnere_\"--\"_aditus non nisi sub persona infantis_\" soon to be  familiar to the world in his published writings--the lines of argument,  sometimes alternative ones, which were before him; he draws out schemes  of inquiry, specimen tables, distinctions and classifications about the  subject of Motion, in English interlarded with Latin, or in Latin  interlarded with English, of his characteristic and practical sort; he  notes the various sources from which he might look for help and  co-operation--\"of learned men beyond the seas\"--\"to begin first in  France to print it\"--\"laying for a place to command wits and pens;\" he  has his eye on rich and childless bishops, on the enforced idleness of  State prisoners in the Tower, like Northumberland and Raleigh, on the  great schools and universities, where he might perhaps get hold of some  college for \"Inventors\"--as we should say, for the endowment of  research. These matters fill up a large space of his notes. But his  thoughts were also busy about his own advancement. And to these sheets  of miscellaneous memoranda Bacon confided not only his occupations and  his philosophical and political ideas, but, with a curious innocent  unreserve, the arts and methods which he proposed to use in order to win  the favour of the great and to pull down the reputation of his rivals.  He puts down in detail how he is to recommend himself to the King and  the King's favourites--         \"To set on foot and maintain access with his Majesty, Dean of the       Chapel, May, Murray. Keeping a course of access at the beginning of       every term and vacation, with a memorial. To attend some time his       repasts, or to fall into a course of familiar discourse. To find       means to win a conceit, not open, but private, of being       affectionate and assured to the Scotch, and fit to succeed       Salisbury in his manage in that kind; Lord Dunbar, Duke of Lennox,       and Daubiny: secret.\"    Then, again, of Salisbury--         \"Insinuate myself to become privy to my Lord of Salisbury's       estate.\" \"To correspond with Salisbury in a habit of natural but no       ways perilous boldness, and in vivacity, invention, care to cast       and enterprise (but with due caution), for this manner I judge both       in his nature freeth the stands, and in his ends pleaseth him best,       and promiseth more use of me. I judge my standing out, and not       favoured by Northampton, must needs do me good with Salisbury,       especially comparative to the"]]]
