Mix into a smooth batter a tea-cup of biscuit powder with beaten eggs,  and sweeten with white sifted sugar; add grated lemon peel, and a  spoonful of orange flower-water, and fry of a light brown; the flavor  may be varied by substituting a few beaten almonds, with one or two  bitter, instead of the orange flower-water.           *       *       *       *       *    A SUPERIOR RECEIPT FOR PASSOVER FRITTERS.    Make a thin batter as already described in the former receipt; drop  it into a soufle pan, fry lightly, and strew over pounded cinnamon,  sifted sugar, and finely chopped almonds; hold over a salamander to  brown the upper side. Slide the fritter on to a hot dish, and fold;  pour over, when in the dish, clarified sugar.           *       *       *       *       *    PASSOVER CURRANT FRITTERS.    Mix a thick batter, as before, add some well-washed and dried  currants, and fry of a rich brown; serve with a sweet sauce, flavored  with wine or shrub, and sweetened with moist sugar; these are often  made in the shape of small balls, and fried and served in the same  sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    BATTER PUDDING.    Stir in three ounces of flour, four beaten eggs, and one pint of milk,  sweeten to taste, and mix to a smooth batter about the thickness of  good cream, and boil in a buttered basin.           *       *       *       *       *    CUSTARD PUDDING.    To one desert spoonful of flour, add one pint of fresh milk and the  yolks of five eggs; flavor according to fancy, with sugar, nutmeg, or  lemon-peel; beat to a froth two whites of eggs and pour to the rest;  boil rather more than half an hour.           *       *       *       *       *    BREAD PUDDING.    Grate stale bread, or soak the crumb of a French roll in milk, which  must be warmed; beat with it two or three eggs, flavor and sweeten  to taste, sometimes with a little wine or essence of lemon, or beaten  almonds; it will require to be boiled about half an hour. This pudding  is excellent made as above, with the addition of the peel of one whole  lemon grated, with its juice, and baked.           *       *       *       *       *    VERMICELLI AND MACCARONI PUDDING.    Boil till tender four ounces of either of the above articles, in a  pint of milk; flavor as directed in the preceding receipt, and boil in  a mould, which may be lined with raisins. It should be served with any  sweet pudding sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    MILLET, ARROWROOT, GROUND RICE, RICE, TAPIOCA, AND SAGO PUDDINGS.    Puddings of this sort are so similar and simple, that it is only  necessary to give one receipt, which will serve as a guide for  all;--they are all made with milk, all require to be thoroughly done,  all require to be mixed with eggs and sweetened with sugar, and  are good either boiled or baked. The cook must use her judgment in  adopting the quantities to the size of the pudding required, and the  taste of the family she serves.           *       *       *       *       *    MINCED MEAT.    Take one pound of tender roasted meat, two pounds of shred suet, three  pounds of currants, six chopped apples, a quarter of a loaf grated,  nutmegs, cloves, pepper, salt, one pound of sugar, grated lemon and  orange peel, lemon juice, and two wine glasses of brandy, the same of  white wine, and two ounces of citron, and the same of candied lemon  peel; mix all well together; the ingredients ought to be added  separately. Minced meat should be kept a day or two before using. The  same proportions, as above, without meat, will be very good; a little  port wine is sometimes substituted for the brandy.           *       *       *       *       *    BAKED SUET PUDDING.    Mix one pint of water, six ounces of flour, three of shred suet, and  two or three beaten eggs; sweeten to taste. Add raisins or currants if  approved, and bake in a brick oven.           *       *       *       *       *    YORKSHIRE PUDDING.    Mix into a smooth batter half a pound of flour, four eggs, if intended  to be rich, otherwise two, a pint of milk, and a little salt, it  should be about an inch thick; it can be made with or without milk by  using a greater proportion of eggs, but it is not so good.           *       *       *       *       *    GATEAU DE TOURS.    Take a pound-cake, cut it in slices about half an inch in thickness,  spread each slice with jam or preserve, then replace them to the  original form; cover the cake with whites of eggs and sugar, whisked  to a froth, and set it in a cool oven to dry.           *       *       *       *       *    JAUMANGE.    Simmer half a pound of white sugar in three-quarters of a pint of  water, with the thinly cut peel of two lemons; when the sugar is  melted, add an ounce of dissolved isinglass, and the juice of three  lemons, a glass of brandy and three of sherry, beat up with this the  yolks of five or six eggs. Place the basin in which it is mixed into a  pan of boiling water to thicken it, then pour it into a mould and set  it to cool; if it does not thicken by being put in a pan of boiling  water, set the pan on the fire and stir it for a few minutes.           *       *       *       *       *    GATEAU DE POMME.    Take ten or twelve fine baking apples, peel and take out the cores,  and let them simmer in milk and water; when soft drain them, and beat  them up with a wooden fork, with half an ounce of dissolved isinglass,  white sifted sugar, sufficient to sweeten, and grated lemon peel. Put  the mixture, when perfectly smooth, into a mould, set it in ice or  a very cool place, when it is turned out it should be covered with a  fine custard.           *       *       *       *       *    APPLE CHARLOTTE.    Prepare the apples as in the last receipt; but instead of using a  jelly mould, put the apples into an oval cake tin about the size of a  small side dish, four or five inches high; when cold, turn it out  and cover the apple-shape with savoy cakes placed closely together  perpendicularly; all round the top of the charlotte should be covered  with whites of eggs and sugar, beaten to a stiff froth, and placed in  small balls; a salamander should be used to crisp them and to give  a slight peach-like colour; a tasteful cook will, after crisping the  first layer of these balls, add others over them to form a sort of  cone high in the centre, that will have a pretty effect if well done.  This is an easy and elegant _entremet_, and by no means an expensive  one.           *       *       *       *       *    A SOUFLE.    Take half a pint of cream and the same quantity of new milk, and warm  them together in a clean saucepan, meanwhile make a smooth batter with  four ounces of rice-flour or potatoe-flour, and stir into the milk,  let it simmer, stirring all the time till it thickens; then add two  to three ounces of fresh butter, and white sifted sugar enough to  sweeten, and a little grated lemon peel; then take it off the fire and  stir quickly to it the well-beaten yolks of six to eight eggs, butter  the pan and pour the mixture into it, when on the point of being  placed into the oven, add the whites of the eggs thoroughly whisked;  the pan must be only half filled, as it will rise very high; it must  be served immediately it is taken from the oven, even in passing to  the dinner table a salamander should be held over it, to prevent its  falling and becoming heavy and unsightly. The French flavour a soufle  with orange flour-water or vanilla, and the rind of a Seville orange  is sometimes substituted for the rind of a lemon; there are dishes  made expressly for soufles.           *       *       *       *       *    A PLAIN SOUFLE.    Mix well together six ounces of rice-flour, arrowroot, or _tous les  mois_, with half a pint of milk flavoured with essence of almond  and lemon peel, or orange-flour water, let it thicken over the fire,  stirring to keep it smooth, sweeten with white sugar, add the beaten  yolks of five eggs, proceed as in the last receipt, adding the whisked  whites at the moment of placing the soufle into the oven; if  there happen to be no soufle dish, a cake-tin may make a tolerable  substitute, a paper fringed should then line the tin and a napkin  should be twisted round it when brought to table.           *       *       *       *       *    A SWEET OMELET.    Beat up three or four eggs, pour them into an omelet pan, and sprinkle  a little white sugar over them while frying, hold a salamander or hot  shovel over the uppermost side of the omelet, as it must only be fried  on one side. As soon as it is set, slide it on to a hot dish, double  it, and sprinkle sugar over it and serve quickly.           *       *       *       *       *    OMLETTE SOUFLEE.    Fry the eggs as directed for sweet omelet, using about five yolks and  two whites, all of which require being finely beaten and strained.  Soften a little preserve by holding it over the fire, or mixing a  little warm water with it, spread it slightly over the omelette, have  the remainder of the whites whisked to a froth with white sugar, and  lay it on the preserve; slide the omelette on to a hot dish, double  it, and serve directly.           *       *       *       *       *    FANCY CREAMS.    Put into a basin a pint of cream, to which add four ounces of powdered  white sugar, and the rind of a lemon rubbed on a lump of sugar, and a  glass of sherry wine; whisk them well and mix with it half an ounce  of dissolved isinglass, beat it all thoroughly together, and fill the  mould, which should be set in ice till wanted. A table spoonful of  marasquino added to the above, will make _Italian cream_. A table  spoonful of fresh or preserved pine-apple will make _pine-apple  cream_; this will require the addition of a little lemon syrup. A  table spoonful of ratafia, will make it _ratifia cream_.    The juice of strawberries or raspberries make fine fruit creams;  _mille fruit cream_ "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#16)"],[1,"hemorrhage will never again be restored to his original powers.    Drugs.--According to their effect upon the brain-cells, drugs  may be divided into three classes:  First, those that stimulate  the brain-cells to increased activity, as strychnin (Fig. 37);  second, those that chemically destroy the brain-cells, as alcohol  and iodoform (Figs. 38 and 39); third, those that suspend the functions  of the cells without damaging them, as nitrous oxid, ether, morphin.  Our experiments have shown that the brain-cell changes induced  by drugs of the first class are precisely the same as the cycle  of changes produced by the emotions and by physical activity.  We have found that strychnin, according to the dosage, causes convulsions  ending in exhaustion and death; excitation followed by lassitude;  stimulation without notable after-results; or      {illust. caption = A, Section of Cerebellum of Normal Dog.  C, Section of  Cerebellum of Dog after Repeated Doses of Strychnin.  FIG.  37.--  BRAIN-CELLS SHOWING STAGE OF HYPERCHROMATISM FOLLOWED BY CHROMATOLYSIS  RESULTING FROM THE CONTINUATION OF THE STIMULUS.  (Camera lucida  drawings.)increased mental tone; while the brain-cells accurately  display these physiologic alterations in proportional hyperchromatism  in the active stages, and proportional chromatolysis in the stages  of reaction.  The biologic and therapeutic application of this fact  is as obvious as it is important.    In our experiments, alcohol in large and repeated dosage caused  marked morphologic changes in the brain-cells which went as far  even as the destruction of some of the cells (Fig. 39). Ether,  on the other hand, even after five hours of administration,  produced no observable destructive changes in the brain-cells.    The effect of iodoform was peculiarly interesting, as it was the only  drug that produced a rise of temperature.  Its observed effect upon  the brain-cells was that of wide-spread destruction.    Infections.--In every observation regarding the effect of pyogenic  infections on dogs and on man we found that they caused definite  and demonstrable lesions in certain cells of the nervous system,  the most marked changes being in the cortex and the cerebellum  (Fig. 40). For example, in fatal infections resulting from  bowel obstruction, in peritonitis, and in osteomyelitis, the real  lesion is in the brain-cells. We may, therefore, reasonably conclude  that the lassitude, the diminished mental power, the excitability,  irritability, restlessness, delirium, and unconsciousness which may  be associated with acute infections, are due to physical changes  in the brain-cells.    Graves' Disease.--In Graves' disease the brain-cells show marked  changes which are apparently the same as those produced by overwork,  by the emotions, and by strychnin.  In the postmortem examination  of one advanced case it was found that a large number of brain-cells  were disintegrated beyond the power of recuperation, even had  the patient lived.  This is undoubtedly the reason why a severe case  of exophthalmic goiter sustains a permanent loss of brain power.    Insomnia.--The brains of rabbits which had been kept awake for one  hundred hours showed precisely the same changes as those shown  in physical fatigue, strychnin poisoning, and exhaustion from  emotional stimulation.  Eight hours of continuous sleep restored  all the cells except those that had been completely exhausted.  This will explain the permanent ill effect of long-continued insomnia;  that is, long-continued insomnia permanently destroys a part  of the brain-cells just as do too great physical exertion,  certain drugs, emotional strain, exophthalmic goiter, and hemorrhage.  We found, however, that if, instead of natural sleep, the rabbits  were placed for the same number of hours under nitrous oxid anesthesia,  not only did the brain-cells recover from the physical deterioration,  but that 90 per cent.  of them became hyperchromatic.  This gives us a possible clue to the actual chemical effect of sleep.  For since nitrous oxid owes its anesthetic effect to its influence  upon oxidation, we may infer that sleep also retards the oxidation  of the cell contents.  If this be true, then it is probable  that inhalation anesthetics exert their peculiar influence upon  that portion of the brain through which sleep itself is produced.  If nitrous oxid anesthesia and sleep are chemically identical, then we  have a further clue to one of the primary mechanisms of life itself;  and as a practical corollary one might be able to produce artificial  sleep which would closely resemble normal sleep, but which would  have this advantage, that by using an anesthetic which interferes with  oxidation the brain-cells might be reconstructed after physical fatigue,  after emotional strain, or after the depression of disease.    In the case of the rabbit in which nitrous oxid was substituted  for sleep, the appearance of the brain-cells resembled that in  but one other group experimentally examined--the brain-cells  of hibernating woodchucks.    Insanity.--Our researches have shown that in the course of a fatal  disease and in fatal exhaustion, however produced, death does not  ensue until there is marked disorganization of the brain tissue.  In the progress of disease or exhaustion one may see in different  patients every outward manifestation of mental deterioration,  manifestations which, in a person who does not show any other sign of  physical disease, mark him as insane.  Take, for example, the progressive  mental state of a brilliant scholar suffering from typhoid fever.  On the first day of the gradual onset of the disease he would  notice that his mental power was below its maximum efficiency;  on the second he would notice a further deterioration, and so  the mental effect of his disease would progress until he would  find it impossible to express a thought or to make a deduction.  No one can be philanthropic with jaundice; no one suffering  from Graves' disease can be generous; no mental process is possible  in the course of the acute infectious diseases.  Just prior to death  from any cause every one is in a mental state which, if it could  be continued, would cause that individual to be judged insane.  If the delirium that occurs in the course of certain diseases  should be continued, the patient would be judged insane.  In severe cases of Graves' disease the patient is insane.  Individuals under overwhelming emotion may be temporarily insane.  Every clinician has seen great numbers of cases in which insanity  is a phase of a disease, of an injury, or of an emotion.  The stage of excitation in anesthesia is insanity.  The only difference between what is conventionally called insanity  and the fleeting insanity of the sick and the injured is that of time.  We may conclude, therefore, what must be the brain-picture of the person  who is permanently insane.  This _a priori_ reasoning is all that  is possible, since the study of the brain in the insane has thus far  been confined to the brains of those who have died of some disease.  And it is impossible to say which changes have been produced by the  fatal disease, and which by the condition which produced the insanity.  The only logical way by which to investigate the physical basis  of insanity would be to make use of the very rare opportunities  of studying the brains of insane persons who have died in accidents.    Our experiments have proved conclusively that whether we call a person  fatigued or diseased, the brain-cells undergo physical deterioration,  accompanied by loss of mental power (Figs. 40 to 43). Even to the minutest  detail we can show a direct relationship between the physical state  of the brain-cells and the mental power of the individual, that is,  the physical power of a person goes _pari passu_ with his mental power.  Indeed, it is impossible to conceive how any mental action,  however subtle, can occur without a corresponding change in the  brain-cells. It is possible now to measure only the evidences of  the effects on the brain-cells of gross and violent mental activity.  At some future time it will doubtless be possible so to refine  the technic of brain-cell examinations that more subtle changes  may be measured.  Nevertheless, with the means at our disposal  we have shown already that in all the conditions which we  have studied the cells of the cortex show the greatest changes,  and that loss of the higher mental functions invariably accompanies  the cell deterioration.          A MECHANISTIC VIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY[*]      [*] Address delivered before Sigma Xi, Case School  of Science, Cleveland, Ohio, May 27, 1913, and published  in _Science_, August 29, 1913.      Traditional religion, traditional medicine, and traditional psychology  have insisted upon the existence in man of a triune nature.  Three \"ologies\" have been developed for the study of each nature  as a separate entity--body, soul, and spirit--physiology, psychology,  theology; physician, psychologist, priest.  To the great minds  of each class, from the days of Aristotle and Hippocrates on,  there have come glimmerings of the truth that the phenomena  studied under these divisions were interrelated.  Always, however,  the conflict between votaries of these sciences has been sharp,  and the boundary lines between them have been constantly changing.  Since the great discoveries of Darwin, the zoologist, biologist,  and physiologist have joined hands, but still the soul-body-spirit  chaos has remained.  The physician has endeavored to fight the gross  maladies which have been the result of disordered conduct;  the psychologist has reasoned and experimented to find the laws  governing conduct; and the priest has endeavored by appeals to an  unknown god to reform conduct.
