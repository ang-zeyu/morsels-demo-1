'How do I know you comprehend my  meaning,' he asks, 'that you understand what I am talking about, if you  say nothing?' At first a student may be silent from nervousness, but if  he is bright he will soon 'catch on,' and see what is expected of him.  Leschetizky says sometimes: 'When the Lord made the ten commandments He  omitted the eleventh, \"Thou shalt not be stupid.\"' If one is not very  quick, one may have a hard time with this master.    \"As a high school in technic I use Joseffy's _School of Advanced Piano  Playing_ with my pupils. This work leads to the highest possible  technical development at the keyboard, and I consider it the last word  in piano technic. The hundreds of exercises have been devised with most  wonderful ingenuity, and the musicianship of the author stands out on  every page. The book is not a dry series of technics but has vital  connection with all the big technical problems found in the literature  of the piano.    \"In teaching, I consider a second piano an absolute necessity. There are  so many things in piano playing which cannot be put into words, and the  teacher must constantly illustrate. How can one teach the interpretation  of a Chopin nocturne, for instance, by merely talking about it. I can  say, 'play loud here--soft there'; but how far do such directions go  toward an artistic conception of the piece? One cannot indicate the  swell of a melody, the tonal and rhythmic _nuance_ of a _groupetto_--and  a thousand other things in any other way than by the living example.  Through imitation one learns rapidly and surely, until one reaches the  point where the wings of one's own individuality begin to sprout.      ABOUT MEMORIZING    \"On the subject of memorizing who can lay down rules for this  inexplicable mental process, which will hold good for every one? For  myself, I hear the notes mentally, and know their position on the  keyboard. In actual performance much must be left to finger memory, but  one must actually have the notes in his mind as well as in his fingers.  Before a concert I go over all my program mentally, and find this an  excellent method of practise when traveling from one city to another. To  those who study with me I say, you must try various methods of  memorizing; there is no universal way; each must find out by experiment  which is most suited to his individual case.    \"With some pianists visual memory of the printed page plays the  principal role in memorizing; with others visual memory of the notes on  the keyboard; with still others ear-memory, or memory of the harmonic  progressions. I believe in making the pupil familiar with all these  different ways, so that he may find out which one is most helpful to  him.    \"For pupils with weak hands and arms I recommend simple gymnastic  exercises to be done morning and evening. Physical strength is a very  necessary essential for a brilliant technic; the student who would  accomplish big things must possess it in order to succeed.      KEEPING TECHNIC IN REPAIR    \"The only way to keep one's technic in repair is to be constantly  working at it. Technic is the mechanical part of music-making; to keep  it in good working order one must be constantly tinkering with it, just  as the engine driver tinkers with his locomotive or the chauffeur with  his automobile. In the course of his technical study every intelligent  pupil will recognize certain exercises which are particularly important  for the mechanical well-being of his playing; from these exercises he  will plan his daily schedule of technical practise.    \"In order to keep a large repertoire going at the same time, one must  have a weekly practise plan, which will allow for a frequent repetition  of the pieces. Those pieces which have been recently added to one's list  will require more frequent repetition, while those which have been  played for a longer period may be left for an occasional brushing up.  Frequent playing before others, either publicly or privately, is above  everything else to be recommended to the pianist, as the greatest  incentive to keeping up his repertoire and toward growing in his art.      AMERICAN VERSUS EUROPEAN CONDITIONS    \"In America many people who have little talent study music, intending to  make it their profession; whereas in Europe there is such a profusion of  music and music-making that only those of more than average gifts think  of making music their life work. In America we are still 'in the  making,' from a musical standpoint, and although we have accomplished  much there is still much to be done. It is the office of the piano  teacher in America to make music study easy and interesting to pupils of  moderate ability. Just these conditions have brought about very  excellent methods of piano and music study for American children, which  have no counterpart in Europe.\"          XVII    FERRUCCIO BUSONI    AN ARTIST AT HOME      As a man's surroundings and environment are often reflections of his  character, it is always a matter of deep interest to get in touch with  the surroundings of the creative or executive musician. To meet him away  from the glare of the footlights, in the privacy and seclusion of the  home, gives one a far more intimate knowledge of the artist as a man.  Knowing how difficult it often is to obtain such an opportunity, I can  be the more thankful that this privilege has been granted me many times,  even with those artists who hold themselves most aloof. I was told  Busoni was exceedingly difficult to approach, and the only way I could  see him was to call at his house quite unannounced, when I might have  the good fortune to find him at home and willing to see me. Not wishing  to take him by storm in this way, I quietly waited, until I received the  following note: \"While I am not fond of interviews, if you will come to  tea on Thursday afternoon, you will be welcome.\"    Busoni is located in a stately _Wohnung_ overlooking the handsome  Victoria Luise Platz, in the newer western section of Berlin. Mme.  Busoni met us as we arrived, and conducted us to the master, who rose  from a cozy nook in a corner of the library to greet us. Tea was soon  brought in and our little party, which included a couple of other  guests, was soon chatting gaily in a mixture of French, German and  English.    During the sprightly chat I could not help glancing from time to time  around the great library in which we sat, noting its artistic  furnishings, and the rows upon rows of volumes in their costly bindings,  which lined the walls. One appreciates what Dr. Johnson meant when he  said that whenever he saw shelves filled with books he always wanted to  get near enough to them to read their titles, as the choice of books  indicates character.    Presently Busoni turned to me: \"I am composing a rhapsodie on American  Indian themes.\"    \"And where did you capture the themes?\" he was asked.    [Illustration: Ferruccio Busoni]    \"From a very charming lady, a countrywoman of yours, Miss Natalie  Curtis. She has taken great interest in the idea and has been most  helpful to me.\"    \"One of the German music papers announced that you are about to leave  Berlin, and have accepted an offer elsewhere--was it in Spain?\"    \"I intend leaving Berlin for a time,\" he admitted, \"and will go to  Bologna--perhaps you thought that was in Spain,\" with a sly side glance  and a humorous twinkle in his eyes. \"My offer from Bologna appears most  flattering. I am appointed head of the great conservatory, but I am not  obliged to live in the city, nor even to give lessons. I shall, however,  go there for a time, and shall probably teach. I am to conduct six large  orchestral concerts during the season, but aside from this I can be  absent as much as I wish. We shall probably close up our house here and  go to Italy in the autumn. Living is very cheap in Bologna; one can rent  a real palace for about $250 a year.\"    Mme. Busoni now invited us to inspect other parts of the house. We  passed to the adjoining room, which contains many rare old prints and  paintings and quaint old furniture--\"everything old,\" as Mme. Busoni  said, with a smile. In this room stands a harpsichord, with its double  keyboard and brilliant red case. It is not an antique but an excellent  copy made by Chickering.    Farther on is a veritable musician's den, with upright piano, and with a  large desk crowded with pictures and mementoes. On the walls hang rare  portraits chiefly of Chopin and Liszt. Beyond this room came the salon,  with its two grand pianos side by side. This is the master's teaching  and recital room, and here are various massive pieces of richly carved  furniture. Mme. Busoni called our attention to the elaborate chandelier  in old silver, of exquisite workmanship, which, she said, had cost her a  long search to find. There are several portraits here of the  composer-pianist in his youth--one as a boy of twelve, a handsome  lad--_bildschoen_, with his curls, his soulful eyes and his big white  collar.    Busoni soon joined us in the salon and the conversation was turned to  his activities in the new field.    \"When you have finished the new rhapsodie you will come and play it to  us in America--and in London also,\" he was urged.    \"Ah, London! I am almost homesick for London; it is beautiful there. I  am fond of America, too. You know I lived there for some years; my son  was born there; he is an American citizen. Yes, I will return, though  just when I do not yet know, and then I will assuredly play the  rhapsodie.\"          XVIII    ADELE AUS DER OHE    ANOTHER ARTIST AT HOME      Another opportunity to see the home of an artist was afforded me when  Frl. Aus der Ohe invited me to visit her in her Berlin home."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning (#16)"],[1," sway                             \"the dark earth beareth in season       Barley and wheat, and the trees are laden with fruitage, and       alway        Yean unfailing the flocks, and the sea gives fish in       abundance.\" (1)     (1) Odyssey xix, 109 sq. Translation by H. B. Cotterill.      As a magician too he was trusted for success in warfare; and  Schoolcraft, in a passage quoted by Andrew Lang, (1) says of the Dacotah  Indians \"the war-chief who leads the party to war is always one of  these medicine-men.\" This connection, however, by which the magician is  transformed into the king has been abundantly studied, and need not be  further dwelt upon here.    And what of the transformation of the king into a god--or of the  Magician or Priest directly into the same? Perhaps in order to  appreciate this, one must make a further digression.    For the early peoples there were, as it would appear, two main objects  in life: (1) to promote fertility in cattle and crops, for food; and (2)  to placate or ward off Death; and it seemed very obvious--even before  any distinct figures of gods, or any idea of prayer, had arisen--to  attain these objects by magic ritual. The rites of Baptism, of  Initiation (or Confirmation) and the many ceremonies of a Second Birth,  which we associate with fully-formed religions, did belong also to  the age of Magic; and they all implied a belief in some kind of  re-incarnation--in a life going forward continually and being renewed  in birth again and again. It is curious that we find such a belief among  the lowest savages even to-day. Dr. Frazer, speaking of the Central  Australian tribes, says the belief is firmly rooted among them \"that the  human soul undergoes an endless series of re-incarnations--the living  men and women of one generation being nothing but the spirits of their  ancestors come to life again, and destined themselves to be reborn  in the persons of their descendants. During the interval between  two re-incarnations the souls live in their nanja spots, or local  totem-centres, which are always natural objects such as trees or rocks.  Each totem-clan has a number of such totem-centres scattered over the  country. There the souls of the dead men and women of the totem, but no  others, congregate, and are born again in human form when a favorable  opportunity presents itself.\" (2)     (1) Myth, Ritual and Religion, vol. i, p. 113.     (2) The Golden Bough, vol. i, p. 96.      And what the early people believed of the human spirit, they believed of  the corn-spirits and the tree and vegetation spirits also. At the great  Spring-ritual among the primitive Greeks \"the tribe and the growing  earth were renovated together: the earth arises afresh from her dead  seeds, the tribe from its dead ancestors.\" And the whole process  projects itself in the idea of a spirit of the year, who \"in the first  stage is living, then dies with each year, and thirdly rises again from  the dead, raising the whole dead world with him. The Greeks called him  in this stage 'The Third One' (Tritos Soter) or 'the Saviour'; and the  renovation ceremonies were accompanied by a casting-off of the old year,  the old garments, and everything that is polluted by the infection of  death.\" (1) Thus the multiplication of the crops and the renovation of  the tribe, and at the same time the evasion and placation of death, were  all assured by similar rites and befitting ceremonial magic. (2)     (1) Gilbert Murray, Four Stages, p. 46.     (2) It is interesting to find, with regard to the renovation of  the tribe, that among the Central Australians the foreskins or male  members of those who died were deposited in the above-mentioned nanja  spots--the idea evidently being that like the seeds of the corn the  seeds of the human crop must be carefully and ceremonially preserved for  their re-incarnation.      In all these cases, and many others that I have not mentioned--of  the magical worship of Bulls and Bears and Rams and Cats and Emus and  Kangaroos, of Trees and Snakes, of Sun and Moon and Stars, and the  spirit of the Corn in its yearly and miraculous resurrection out of the  ground--there is still the same idea or moving inspiration, the sense  mentioned in the foregoing chapter, the feeling (hardly yet conscious of  its own meaning) of intimate relationship and unity with all this outer  world, the instinctive conviction that the world can be swayed by the  spirit of Man, if the man can only find the right ritual, the right  word, the right spell, wherewith to move it. An aura of emotion  surrounded everything--of terror, of tabu, of fascination, of desire.  The world, to these people, was transparent with presences related to  themselves; and though hunger and sex may have been the dominant and  overwhelmingly practical needs of their life, yet their outlook on the  world was essentially poetic and imaginative.    Moreover it will be seen that in this age of magic and the belief in  spirits, though there was an intense sense of every thing being  alive, the gods, in the more modern sense of the world, hardly existed  (1)--that is, there was no very clear vision, to these people, of  supra-mundane beings, sitting apart and ordaining the affairs of  earth, as it were from a distance. Doubtless this conception was slowly  evolving, but it was only incipient. For the time being--though there  might be orders and degrees of spirits (and of gods)--every such being  was only conceived of, and could only be conceived of, as actually a  part of Nature, dwelling in and interlaced with some phenomenon of Earth  and Sky, and having no separate existence.     (1) For a discussion of the evolution of RELIGION out of MAGIC,  see Westermarck's Origin of Moral Ideas, ch. 47.      How was it then, it will be asked, that the belief in separate and  separable gods and goddesses--each with his or her well-marked outline  and character and function, like the divinities of Greece, or of India,  or of the Egyptian or Christian religions, ultimately arose? To  this question Jane Harrison (in her Themis and other books) gives an  ingenious answer, which as it chimes in with my own speculations (in the  Art of Creation and elsewhere) I am inclined to adopt. It is that the  figures of the supranatural gods arose from a process in the human mind  similar to that which the photographer adopts when by photographing a  number of faces on the same plate, and so superposing their images on  one another, he produces a so-called \"composite\" photograph or image.  Thus, in the photographic sphere, the portraits of a lot of members  of the same family superposed upon one another may produce a composite  image or ideal of that family type, or the portraits of a number of  Aztecs or of a number of Apache Indians the ideals respectively of the  Aztec or of the Apache types. And so in the mental sphere of each member  of a tribe the many images of the well-known Warriors or Priests or  wise and gracious Women of that tribe did inevitably combine at last  to composite figures of gods and goddesses--on whom the enthusiasm  and adoration of the tribe was concentrated. (1) Miss Harrison has  ingeniously suggested how the leading figures in the magic rituals of  the past--being the figures on which all eyes would be concentrated; and  whose importance would be imprinted on every mind--lent themselves to  this process. The suffering Victim, bound and scourged and crucified,  recurring year after year as the centre-figure of a thousand ritual  processions, would at last be dramatized and idealized in the great  race-consciousness into the form of a Suffering God--a Jesus Christ or  a Dionysus or Osiris--dismembered or crucified for the salvation of  mankind. The Priest or Medicine-Man--or rather the succession of Priests  or Medicine-Men--whose figures would recur again and again as leaders  and ordainers of the ceremonies, would be glorified at last into the  composite-image of a God in whom were concentrated all magic powers.  \"Recent researches,\" says Gilbert Murray, \"have shown us in abundance  the early Greek medicine-chiefs making thunder and lightning and rain.\"  Here is the germ of a Zeus or a Jupiter. The particular medicine-man  may fail; that does not so much matter; he is only the individual  representative of the glorified and composite being who exists in the  mind of the tribe (just as a present-day King may be unworthy, but is  surrounded all the same by the agelong glamour of Royalty). \"The real  [gr qeos], tremendous, infallible, is somewhere far away, hidden in  clouds perhaps, on the summit of some inaccessible mountain. If the  mountain is once climbed the god will move to the upper sky. The  medicine-chief meanwhile stays on earth, still influential. He has some  connection with the great god more intimate than that of other men... he  knows the rules for approaching him and making prayers to him.\" (2) Thus  did the Medicine-man, or Priest, or Magician (for these are but three  names for one figure) represent one step in the evolution of the god.     (1) See The Art of Creation, ch. viii, \"The Gods as Apparitions  of the Race-Life.\"     (2) The Four Stages, p. 140.      And farther back still in the evolutionary process we may trace (as in  chapter iv above) the divinization or deification of four-footed animals  and birds and snakes and trees and the like, from the personification of  the collective emotion of the tribe towards these creatures. For people  whose chief food was bear-meat, for instance, whose totem was a bear,  and who believed themselves descended from an ursine ancestor, there  would grow up in the tribal mind an image surrounded by a halo of  emotions--emotions of hungry desire, of reverence, fear, gratitude and  so forth--an image of a divine Bear in whom they lived and moved and had  their being. For another tribe or group in whose yearly ritual a Bull or  a Lamb or a Kangaroo played a leading part"]]]
