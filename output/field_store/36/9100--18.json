IV      But still the hens were disappearing. My uncle was wrathy. He determined  to conduct the war himself, and sowed the woods with poison baits,  trusting to luck that our own dogs would not get them. He indulged in  contemptuous remarks on my by-gone woodcraft, and went out evenings with  a gun and the two dogs, to see what he could destroy.    Vix knew right well what a poison bait was; she passed them by or else  treated them with active contempt, but one she dropped down the hole, of  an old enemy, a skunk, who was never afterward seen. Formerly old  Scarface was always ready to take charge of the dogs, and keep them out  of mischief. But now that Vix had the whole burden of the brood, she  could no longer spend time in breaking every track to the den, and was  not always at hand to meet and mislead the foes that might be coming too  near.    The end is easily foreseen. Ranger followed a hot trail to the den, and  Spot, the fox-terrier, announced that the family was at home, and then  did his best to go in after them.    The whole secret was now out, and the whole family doomed. The hired man  came around with pick and shovel to dig them out, while we and the dogs  stood by. Old Vix soon showed herself in the near woods, and led the  dogs away off down the river, where she shook them off when she thought  proper, by the simple device of springing on a sheep's back. The  frightened animal ran for several hundred yards; then Vix got off,  knowing that there was now a hopeless gap in the scent, and returned to  the den. But the dogs, baffled by the break in the trail, soon did the  same, to find Vix hanging about in despair, vainly trying to decoy us  away from her treasures.    Meanwhile Paddy plied both pick and shovel with vigor and effect. The  yellow, gravelly sand was heaping on both sides, and the shoulders of  the sturdy digger were sinking below the level. After an hour's digging,  enlivened by frantic rushes of the dogs after the old fox, who hovered  near in the woods, Pat called:    \"Here they are, sor!\"    It was the den at the end of the burrow, and cowering as far back as  they could, were the four little woolly cubs.    Before I could interfere, a murderous blow from the shovel, and a sudden  rush for the fierce little terrier, ended the lives of three. The fourth  and smallest was barely saved by holding him by his tail high out of  reach of the excited dogs.    He gave one short squeal, and his poor mother came at the cry, and  circled so near that she would have been shot but for the accidental  protection of the dogs, who somehow always seemed to get between, and  whom she once more led away on a fruitless chase.    The little one saved alive was dropped into a bag, where he lay quite  still. His unfortunate brothers were thrown back into their nursery bed,  and buried under a few shovelfuls of earth.    We guilty ones then went back into the house, and the little fox was  soon chained in the yard. No one knew just why he was kept alive, but in  all a change of feeling had set in, and the idea of killing him was  without a supporter.    He was a pretty little fellow, like a cross between a fox and a lamb.  His woolly visage and form were strangely lamb-like and innocent, but  one could find in his yellow eyes a gleam of cunning and savageness as  unlamb-like as it possibly could be.    As long as anyone was near he crouched sullen and cowed in his  shelter-box, and it was a full hour after being left alone before he  ventured to look out.    My window now took the place of the hollow basswood. A number of hens of  the breed he knew so well were about the cub in the yard. Late that  afternoon as they strayed near the captive there was a sudden rattle of  the chain, and the youngster dashed at the nearest one and would have  caught him but for the chain which brought him up with a jerk. He got on  his feet and slunk back to his box, and though he afterward made several  rushes he so gauged his leap as to win or fail within the length of the  chain and never again was brought up by its cruel jerk.    As night came down the little fellow became very uneasy, sneaking out of  his box, but going back at each slight alarm, tugging at his chain, or  at times biting it in fury while he held it down with his fore-paws.  Suddenly he paused as though listening, then raising his little black  nose he poured out a short, quavering cry.    Once or twice this was repeated, the time between being occupied in  worrying the chain and running about. Then an answer came. The far-away  _Yap yurrr_ of the old fox. A few minutes later a shadowy form appeared  on the wood-pile. The little one slunk into his box, but at once  returned and ran to meet his mother with all the gladness that a fox  could show. Quick as a flash she seized him and turned to bear him away  by the road she came. But the moment the end of the chain was reached  the cub was rudely jerked from the old one's mouth, and she, scared by  the opening of a window, fled over the wood-pile.    An hour afterward the cub had ceased to run about or cry. I peeped out,  and by the light of the moon saw the form of the mother at full length  on the ground by the little one gnawing at something--the clank of iron  told what, it was that cruel chain. And Tip, the little one, meanwhile  was helping himself to a warm drink.    On my going out she fled into the dark woods, but there by the  shelter-box were two little mice, bloody and still warm, food for the  cub brought by the devoted mother. And in the morning I found the chain  was very bright for a foot or two next the little one's collar.    On walking across the woods to the ruined den, I again found signs of  Vixen. The poor heart-broken mother had come and dug out the bedraggled  bodies of her little ones.    There lay the three little baby foxes all licked smooth now, and by them  were two of our hens fresh killed. The newly heaved earth was printed  all over with tell-tale signs--signs that told me that here by the side  of her dead she had watched like Rizpah. Here she had brought their  usual meal, the spoil of her nightly hunt. Here she had stretched  herself beside them and vainly offered them their natural drink and  yearned to feed and warm them as of old; but only stiff little bodies  under their soft wool she found, and little cold noses still and  unresponsive.    A deep impress of elbows, breast, and hocks showed where she had laid in  silent grief and watched them for long and mourned as a wild mother can  mourn for its young. But from that time she came no more to the ruined  den, for now she surely knew that her little ones were dead.          V      Tip, the captive, the weakling of the brood, was now the heir to all her  love. The dogs were loosed to guard the hens. The hired man had orders  to shoot the old fox on sight--so had I, but was resolved never to see  her. Chicken-heads, that a fox loves and a dog will not touch, had been  poisoned and scattered through the woods; and the only way to the yard  where Tip was tied was by climbing the wood-pile after braving all other  dangers. And yet each night old Vix was there to nurse her baby and  bring it fresh-killed hens and game. Again and again I saw her, although  she came now without awaiting the querulous cry of the captive.    The second night of the captivity I heard the rattle of the chain, and  then made out that the old fox was there, hard at work digging a hole by  the little one's kennel. When it was deep enough to half bury her, she  gathered into it all the slack of the chain, and filled it again with  earth. Then in triumph thinking she had gotten rid of the chain, she  seized little Tip by the neck and turned to dash off up the woodpile,  but alas only to have him jerked roughly from her grasp.    Poor little fellow, he whimpered sadly as he crawled into his box. After  half an hour there was a great outcry among the dogs, and by their  straight-away tonguing through the far woods I knew they were chasing  Vix. Away up north they went in the direction of the railway and their  noise faded from hearing. Next morning the hound had not come back. We  soon knew why. Foxes long ago learned what a railroad is; they soon  devised several ways of turning it to account. One way is when hunted to  walk the rails for a long distance just before a train comes. The scent,  always poor on iron, is destroyed by the train and there is always a  chance of hounds being killed by the engine. But another way more sure,  but harder to play, is to lead the hounds straight to a high trestle  just ahead of the train, so that the engine overtakes them on it and  they are surely dashed to destruction.    This trick was skilfully played, and down below we found the mangled  remains of old Ranger and learned that Vix was already wreaking her  revenge.    That same night she returned to the yard before Spot's weary limbs could  bring him back and killed another hen and brought it to Tip, and  stretched her panting length beside him that he might quench his  thirst. For she seemed to think he had no food but what she brought.    It was that hen that betrayed to my uncle the nightly visits.    My own sympathies were all turning to Vix, and I would have no hand in  planning further murders. Next night my uncle himself watched, gun in  hand, for an hour. Then when it became cold and the moon clouded over he  remembered other important business elsewhere, and left Paddy in his  place.    But Paddy was \"onaisy\" as the stillness and anxiety of watching worked  on his nerves. And the loud bang! bang! an hour later left us sure only  that powder had been burned.    In the morning we found Vix had not failed her young one. Again next  night found my uncle on guard, for another hen had been taken. Soon  after dark a single shot was heard, but Vix dropped the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14241"],[0,"More English Fairy Tales (#16)"],[1,"Murder's heart relent;       And they that undertook the deed         Full sore now did repent.       Yet one of them, more hard of heart,         Did vow to do his charge,       Because the wretch that hired him         Had paid him very large.         The other won't agree thereto,         So there they fall to strife;       With one another they did fight         About the children's life;       And he that was of mildest mood         Did slay the other there,       Within an unfrequented wood;         The babes did quake for fear!         He took the children by the hand,         Tears standing in their eye,       And bade them straightway follow him,         And look they did not cry;       And two long miles he led them on,         While they for food complain:       \"Stay here,\" quoth he, \"I'll bring you bread,         When I come back again.\"         These pretty babes, with hand in hand,         Went wandering up and down;       But never more could see the man         Approaching from the town.       Their pretty lips with blackberries         Were all besmeared and dyed;       And when they saw the darksome night,         They sat them down and cried.         Thus wandered these poor innocents,         Till death did end their grief;       In one another's arms they died,         As wanting due relief:       No burial this pretty pair         From any man receives,       Till Robin Redbreast piously         Did cover them with leaves.         And now the heavy wrath of God         Upon their uncle fell;       Yea, fearful fiends did haunt his house,         His conscience felt an hell:       His barns were fired, his goods consumed,         His lands were barren made,       His cattle died within the field,         And nothing with him stayed.         And in a voyage to Portugal         Two of his sons did die;       And to conclude, himself was brought         To want and misery:       He pawned and mortgaged all his land         Ere seven years came about.       And now at last this wicked act         Did by this means come out,         The fellow that did take in hand         These children for to kill,       Was for a robbery judged to die,         Such was God's blessed will:       Who did confess the very truth,         As here hath been displayed:       The uncle having died in jail,         Where he for debt was laid.         You that executors be made,         And overseers eke,       Of children that be fatherless,         And infants mild and meek,       Take you example by this thing,         And yield to each his right,       Lest God with suchlike misery         Your wicked minds requite.          The Hobyahs      Once there was an old man and woman and a little girl, and they all  lived in a house made of hempstalks. Now the old man had a little dog  named Turpie; and one night the Hobyahs came and said, \"Hobyah! Hobyah!  Hobyah! Tear down the hempstalks, eat up the old man and woman, and  carry off the little girl!\" But little dog Turpie barked so that the  Hobyahs ran off; and the old man said, \"Little dog Turpie barks so that  I cannot sleep nor slumber, and if I live till morning I will cut off  his tail.\" So in the morning the old man cut off little dog Turpie's  tail.    The next night the Hobyahs came again, and said, \"Hobyah! Hobyah!  Hobyah! Tear down the hempstalks, eat up the old man and woman, and  carry off the little girl!\" But little dog Turpie barked so that the  Hobyahs ran off; and the old man said, \"Little dog Turpie barks so that  I cannot sleep nor slumber, and if I live till morning I will cut off  one of his legs.\" So in the morning the old man cut off one of little  dog Turpie's legs.    The next night the Hobyahs came again, and said, \"Hobyah! Hobyah!  Hobyah! Tear down the hempstalks, eat up the old man and woman, and  carry off the little girl!\" But little dog Turpie barked so that the  Hobyahs ran off; and the old man said, \"Little dog Turpie barks so that  I cannot sleep nor slumber, and if I live till morning I will cut off  another of his legs.\" So in the morning the old man cut off another of  little dog Turpie's legs.    The next night the Hobyahs came again, and said, \"Hobyah! Hobyah!  Hobyah! Tear down the hempstalks, eat up the old man and woman, and  carry off the little girl!\" But little dog Turpie barked so that the  Hobyahs ran off; and the old man said, \"Little dog Turpie barks so that  I cannot sleep nor slumber, and if I live till morning I will cut off  another of his legs.\" So in the morning the old man cut off another of  little dog Turpie's legs.    The next night the Hobyahs came again, and said, \"Hobyah! Hobyah!  Hobyah! Tear down the hempstalks, eat up the old man and woman, and  carry off the little girl!\" But little dog Turpie barked so that the  Hobyahs ran off; and the old man said, \"Little dog Turpie barks so that  I cannot sleep nor slumber, and if I live till morning I will cut off  another of his legs.\" So in the morning the old man cut off another of  little dog Turpie's legs.

The next night the Hobyahs came again, and said, \"Hobyah! Hobyah!  Hobyah! Tear down the hempstalks, eat up the old man and woman, and  carry off the little girl!\" And when the Hobyahs found that little dog  Turpie's head was off they tore down the hempstalks, ate up the old man  and woman, and carried the little girl off in a bag.    And when the Hobyahs came to their home they hung up the bag with the  little girl in it, and every Hobyah knocked on the top of the bag and  said, \"Look me! look me!\" And then they went to sleep until the next  night, for the Hobyahs slept in the daytime.    The little girl cried a great deal, and a man with a big dog came that  way and heard her crying. When he asked her how she came there and she  told him, he put the dog in the bag and took the little girl to his  home.    The next night the Hobyahs took down the bag and knocked on the top of  it, and said \"Look me! look me!\" and when they opened the bag--the big  dog jumped out and ate them all up; so there are no Hobyahs now.          A Pottle o' Brains      Once in these parts, and not so long gone neither, there was a fool that  wanted to buy a pottle o' brains, for he was ever getting into scrapes  through his foolishness, and being laughed at by every one. Folk told  him that he could get everything he liked from the wise woman that lived  on the top o' the hill, and dealt in potions and herbs and spells and  things, and could tell thee! all as 'd come to thee or thy folk. So he  told his mother, and asked her if he could seek the wise woman and buy a  pottle o' brains.    \"That ye should,\" says she; \"thou 'st sore need o' them, my son: and if  I should die, who'd take care o' a poor fool such 's thou, no more fit  to look after thyself than an unborn baby? but mind thy manners, and  speak her pretty, my lad; for they wise folk are gey and light  mispleased.\"    So off he went after his tea, and there she was, sitting by the fire,  and stirring a big pot.    \"Good e'en, missis,\" says he, \"it's a fine night.\"    \"Aye,\" says she, and went on stirring.    \"It'll maybe rain,\" says he, and fidgeted from one foot to t' other.    \"Maybe,\" says she.    \"And m'appen it won't,\" says he, and looked out o' the window.    \"M'appen,\" says she.    And he scratched his head and twisted his hat.    \"Well,\" says he, \"I can't mind nothing else about the weather, but let  me see; the crops are getting on fine.\"    \"Fine,\" says she.    \"And--and--the beasts is fattening,\" says he.    \"They are,\" says she.    \"And--and--\" says he, and comes to a stop--\"I reckon we'll tackle  business now, having done the polite like. Have you any brains for to  sell?\"    \"That depends,\" says she, \"if thou wants king's brains, or soldier's  brains, or schoolmaster's brains, I dinna keep 'em.\"    \"Hout no,\" says he, \"jist ordinary brains--fit for any fool--same as  every one has about here; something clean common-like.\"    \"Aye so,\" says the wise woman, \"I might manage that, if so be thou 'lt  help thyself.\"    \"How's that for, missis?\" says he.    \"Jest so,\" says she, looking in the pot; \"bring me the heart of the  thing thou likest best of all, and I'll tell thee where to get thy  pottle o' brains.\"    \"But,\" says he, scratching his head, \"how can I do that?\"    \"That's no for me to say,\" says she, \"find out for thyself, my lad! if  thou doesn't want to be a fool all thy days. But thou 'll have to read  me a riddle so as I can see thou 'st brought the right thing, and if thy  brains is about thee. And I've something else to see to,\" says she, \"so  gode'en to thee,\" and she carried the pot away with her into the back  place.    So off went the fool to his mother, and told her what the wise woman  said.    \"And I reckon I'll have to kill that pig,\" says he, \"for I like fat  bacon better than anything.\"    \"Then do it, my lad,\" said his mother, \"for certain 't will be a strange  and good thing fur thee, if thou canst buy a pottle o' brains, and be  able to look after thy own self.\"    So he killed his pig, and next day off he went to the wise woman's  cottage, and there she sat, reading in a great book.    \"Gode'en, missis,\" says he, \"I've brought thee the heart o' the thing I  like the best of all; and I put it hapt in paper on the table.\"    \"Aye so?\" says she, and looked at him through her spectacles. \"Tell me  this then, what runs without feet?\"    He scratched his head, and thought, and thought, but he couldn't tell.    \"Go thy ways,\" says she, \"thou 'st "]]]
