At that      time only a few trees were known to have been killed by this      disease, but now the disease has advanced over the whole chestnut      area in the United States, reaching as far south as Virginia and as      far west as Buffalo. Fig. 111 shows the result of the chestnut      disease.        The fungus attacks the cambium tissue underneath the bark. It enters      through a wound in the bark and sends its fungous threads from the      point of infection all around the trunk until the latter is girdled      and killed. This may all happen within one season. It is not until      the tree has practically been destroyed that the disease makes its      appearance on the surface of the bark in the form of brown patches      studded with little pustules that carry the spores. When once      girdled, the tree is killed above the point of infection and      everything above dies, while some of the twigs below may live until      they are attacked individually by the disease or until the trunk      below their origin is infected.        All species of chestnut trees are subject to the disease. The      Japanese and Spanish varieties appear to be highly resistant, but      are not immune. Other species of trees besides chestnuts are not      subject to the disease.    [Illustration: FIG. 111.--Chestnut Trees Killed by the Chestnut  Disease.]        There is no remedy or preventive for this disease. From the nature      of its attack, which is on the inner layer of the tree, it is      evident that all applications of fungicides, which must necessarily      be applied to the outside of the tree, will not reach the disease.      Injections are impossible and other suggested remedies, such as      boring holes in the wood for the purpose of inserting chemicals, are      futile.        The wood of the chestnut tree, within three or four years after its      death, is still sound and may be used for telephone and telegraph      poles, posts, railroad ties, lumber and firewood.    Spraying for fungous diseases: Where a fungous disease is attacking the      leaves, fruit, or twigs, spraying with Bordeaux mixture may prove      effective. The application of Bordeaux mixture is deterrent rather      than remedial, and should therefore be made immediately before the      disease appears. The nature of the disease and the time of treatment      can be determined without cost, by submitting specimens of affected      portions of the plant for analysis and advice to the State      Agricultural Experiment Station or to the United States Department      of Agriculture.        Bordeaux mixture, the standard fungicide material, consists of a      solution of 6 pounds of copper sulphate (blue vitriol) with 4 pounds      of slaked lime in 50 gallons of water. It may be purchased in      prepared form in the open market, and when properly made, has a      brilliant sky-blue color. Spraying with Bordeaux mixture should be      done in the fall, early spring, or early summer, but never during      the period when the trees are in bloom.        STUDY III. PRUNING TREES      FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES    Trees are very much like human beings in their requirements, mode of  life and diseases, and the general principles applicable to the care of  one are equally important to the intelligent treatment of the other. The  removal of limbs from trees, as well as from human beings, must be done  sparingly and judiciously. Wounds, in both trees and human beings, must  be disinfected and dressed to keep out all fungus or disease germs.  Fungous growths of trees are similar to human cancers, both in the  manner of their development and the surgical treatment which they  require. Improper pruning will invite fungi and insects to the tree,  hence the importance of a knowledge of fundamental principles in this  branch of tree care.    [Illustration: FIG. 112.--A Tree Pruned Improperly and too Severely.]    Time: Too much pruning at one time should never be practiced (Fig. 112),      and no branch should be removed from a tree without good reason for      so doing. Dead and broken branches should be removed as soon as      observed, regardless of any special pruning season, because they are      dangerous, unsightly and carry insects and disease into the heart of      the tree. But all other pruning, whether it be for the purpose of      perfecting the form in shade trees, or for increasing the production      of fruit in orchard trees, should be confined to certain seasons.      Shade and ornamental trees can best be pruned in the fall, while the      leaves are still on the tree and while the tree itself is in      practically a dormant state.    Proper cutting: All pruning should be commenced at the top of the tree      and finished at the bottom. A shortened branch (excepting in poplars      and willows, which should be cut in closely) should terminate in      small twigs which may draw the sap to the freshly cut wound; where a      branch is removed entirely, the cut should be made-close and even      with the trunk, as in Fig. 113. Wherever there is a stub left after      cutting off a branch, the growing tissue of the tree cannot cover it      and the stub eventually decays, falls out and leaves a hole (see      Fig. 114), which serves to carry disease and insects to the heart of      the tree. This idea of close cutting cannot be over-emphasized.        Where large branches have to be removed, the splitting and ripping      of the bark along the trunk is prevented by making one cut beneath      the branch, about a foot or two away from the trunk, and then      another above, close to the trunk.    [Illustration: FIG. 113.--Branches Properly Cut Close to the Trunk.]    Too severe pruning: In pruning trees, many people have a tendency to cut      them back so severely as to remove everything but the bare trunk and      a few of the main branches. This process is known as \"heading      back.\" It is a method, however, which should not be resorted to      except in trees that are very old and failing, and even there only      with certain species, like the silver maple, sycamore, linden and      elm. Trees like the sugar maple will not stand this treatment at      all. The willow is a tree that will stand the process very readily      and the Carolina poplar must be cut back every few years, in order      to keep its crown from becoming too tall, scraggy and unsafe.    [Illustration: FIG. 114.--A Limb Improperly Cut. Note how the stub is  decaying and the resulting cavity is becoming diseased.]    Covering wounds: The importance of immediately covering all wounds with      coal tar cannot be overstated. If the wound is not tarred, the      exposed wood cracks, as in Fig. 115, providing suitable quarters for      disease germs that will eventually destroy the body of the tree.      Coal tar is by far preferable to paint and other substances for      covering the wound. The tar penetrates the exposed wood, producing      an antiseptic as well as a protective effect. Paint only forms a      covering, which may peel off in course of time and which will later      protrude from the cut, thus forming, between the paint and the wood,      a suitable breeding place for the development of destructive fungi      or disease. The application of tin covers, burlap, or other bandages      to the wound is equally futile and in most cases even injurious.    [Illustration: FIG. 115.--Result of a Wound not Covered with Coal Tar.  The exposed wood cracked and decay set in.]      SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS    Pruning shade trees: Here, the object is to produce a symmetrical crown      and to have the lowest branches raised from the ground sufficiently      high to enable pedestrians to pass under with raised umbrellas. Such      pruning should, therefore, necessarily be light and confined to the      low limbs and dead branches.    Pruning lawn trees: Here the charm of the tree lies in the low reach of      the branches and the compactness of the crown. The pruning should,      therefore, be limited to the removal of dead and diseased branches      only.    Pruning forest trees: Forest trees have a greater commercial value when      their straight trunks are free from branches. In the forest, nature      generally accomplishes this result and artificial pruning seldom has      to be resorted to. Trees in the forest grow so closely together that      they shut out the sunlight from their lower limbs, thus causing the      latter to die and fall off. This is known as natural pruning. In      some European forests, nature is assisted in its pruning by workmen,      who saw off the side branches before they fall of their own accord;      but in this country such practice would be considered too expensive,      hence it is seldom adopted.      TOOLS USED IN PRUNING    Good tools are essential for quick and effective work in pruning. Two or  three good saws, a pair of pole-shears, a pole-saw, a 16-foot single  ladder, a 40-foot extension ladder of light spruce or pine with hickory  rungs, a good pruning knife, plenty of coal tar, a fire-can to heat the  tar, a pole-brush, a small hand brush and plenty of good rope comprise  the principal equipment of the pruner.      SUGGESTIONS FOR THE SAFETY OF TREE CLIMBERS    1. Before climbing a tree, judge its general condition. The trunk of a  tree that shows age, disease, or wood-destroying insects generally has  its branches in an equally unhealthy condition.    2. The different kinds of wood naturally differ in their strength and  elasticity. The soft and brash woods need greater precautions than the  strong and pliable ones. The wood of all the poplars, the ailanthus, the  silver maple and the chestnut, catalpa and willow is either too soft or  too brittle to be depended upon without special care. The elm, hickory  and oak have strong, flexible woods and are, therefore, safer than  others.

The original edition of 1585 said he made an \"arte y  vocabulario.\" We must take the phrase \"in few daies\" in a comparative  sense, but that an Augustinian, probably Rada, knew some Chinese as  early as July 30, 1574 is shown by a letter from Governor Lavezaris  to the King from Manila, sending him \"a map of the whole land of  China, with an explanation which I had some Chinese interpreters  make through the aid of an Augustinian religious who is acquainted  with the elements of the Chinese language,\" B. & R., III, p. 284,  from the original MS. in the A. of I.

Antonio de Leon Pinelo, _Epitome de la Biblioteca Oriental  i Occidental, Nautica i Geographica_, Madrid, 1629, p. 31, also  records Rada's Chinese grammar and dictionary. Santiago Vela, VI,  pp. 444-60, gives a full history of Rada and his writings. He went  to China a second time in May 1576, and in 1578 accompanied La Sande  on his expedition to Borneo, dying on the way back to Manila in June  of that year.    [62] Gonzalez de Mendoza, _op. cit._, pp. 103-5.    [63] Diego Ordonez Vivar came to the Philippines in 1570, filled  various ministries there, and according to Agustin Maria de Castro  was in Japan  in  1597,  where  he  witnessed the martyrdom of the  Franciscans; he died in 1603, Perez, p. 10. Juan de Medina, p. 74,  says, \"Father Diego de Ordonez learned this language [Tagalog] very  quickly.\" Alonso Alvatado had been on the unsuccessful 1542 expedition  of Villalobos, and returned to the Philippines in 1571. Perez, p. 11,  records that he became familiar with the Tagalog language, was the  first prior of Tondo, ministered to the Chinese there, and was the  first Spaniard to learn the Mandarin dialect. He was elected provincial  in 1575, and died at Manila the following year. Jeronimo Marin came  to the islands with Alvarado, acquired skill in the Visayan, Tagalog  and Chinese languages, accompanied Rada on his first expedition to  China, was in Tondo in 1578, and later returned to Spain to recruit  new missionaries for the province, dying in Mexico in 1606, Perez,  pp. 11-12.    [64] Cano, p. 12. Santiago Vela, I, p. 85, expresses the opinion that  Cano's statement was an overenthusiasm, and is not valid.    [65] Retana, col. 9.    [66] Juan de Medina, p. 156.    [67] Santiago Vela, I, p. 85, where he cites the first book of the  _Gobierno_ of the Augustinian province.    [68] Santiago Vela, I, pp. 84-6 treats of the whole question in detail.    [69] A Doctrina in Tagalog, attributed to Alburquerque by Agustin  Maria de Castro in his unpublished _Osario_, is said by Santiago Vela,  I, p. 85, to have been arranged and perfected by Quinones, and was  probably that presented by him to the Synod of 1582, if indeed he  did present such a work then. For an account of the MS. _Osario_,  see Schilling, p. 205n.    [70] Perez, p. 20n, quotes Vicente Barrantes, _El teatro tagalo_,  Madrid, 1890, p. 170, as saying that \"according to the Augustinian  writers\" Alburquerque compiled an _Arte de la Lengua Tagala_ between  1570 and 1580, the manuscript of which disappeared when the English  sacked Manila in 1762. It may be that Barrantes referred to Cano  or possibly Castro, but it must be emphasized that no contemporary  historian, as far as has been discovered up to this time, has made  such a statement.    [71] Quinones came to the Philippines in 1577 and spent his time in  missions in and about Manila. He was named prior of Manila in 1586,  and provincial vicar in 1587 in which year he died, Perez, p. 19,  and Santiago Vela, VI, pp. 433-4.    [72] Again Castro, as cited by Santiago Vela, VI, p. 435, is the only  authority for this, although San Agustin, p. 391, lists Quinones'  name among those present at the Synod.    [73] San Agustin, p. 381. It should be noted that this statement is  in direct contradiction to those we shall cite later in connection  with the controversy between the Augustinians and Dominicans over  the Chinese ministry. The convent at Tondo had been founded in 1571,  so San Agustin here must refer specifically to the Chinese mission.    [74] Perez, p. 22.    [75] Perez, p. 29.    [76] Huerta, pp. 443 & 500-01.
