Bless my excursion ticket, don't think that, Tom!\" cried his friend  quickly.    \"I know better than to ask you out for a pleasure jaunt. But I have  become interested in a certain candy-making machine that a man over in  Newmarket is anxious to sell me a share in, and I'd like to get your  opinion. Can you run over?\"    \"Yes,\" Tom answered. \"As it happens I am going to Newmarket myself.\"    \"Oh, I forgot about Mary Nestor being there!\" laughed Mr. Damon. \"Sly  dog, Tom! Sly dog!\" and he nudged the youth in the ribs.    \"It isn't altogether Mary. Though I am going to see her,\" Tom admitted.  \"It has to do with a little apparatus I am getting up.  I can capture  several birds in the same auto, so I'll go along.\"    This pleased Mr. Damon, and he and Tom were soon speeding over the  road. It was just outside Newmarket that they saw an automobile stalled  at the foot of a hill which they topped. It needed but a glance to show  that there was serious trouble. As Mr. Damon's car went down the slope  two men could be seen leaping from the other machine. And, as they did  so, flames burst out of the rear of the stalled machine.    \"Fire! Fire!\" cried Mr. Damon, rather needlessly it would seem, as any  one could see the blaze.    \"Another chance!\" exclaimed Tom, reaching down between his feet for a  wrapped object he had placed in Mr. Damon's car. \"It's Field and  Melling!\" he cried. \"The two men who boasted of having put it over on  Mr. Baxter. Their car is blazing. Here's where I get a chance to heap  coals of fire on their heads!\"          CHAPTER XVI    VIOLENT THREATS      Tom Swift's companion in the automobile was sufficiently acquainted  with this old expression to understand readily what it meant. And as he  directed his car as close as was safe to the blazing car, Mr. Damon  asked:    \"Are you going to put out that fire for them, Tom?\"    \"I'm going to try,\" was the grim answer.    The young inventor was rapidly taking out of wrapping paper a metal  cylinder with a short nozzle on one end and a handle on the other. It  was, obviously, a hand fire extinguisher of a type familiar to all.    \"Wait Tom, I'll slow up a little more,\" said Mr. Damon, as he applied  the brakes with more force. \"Bless my court plaster!  don't jump and  injure yourself.\"    But Tom Swift was sufficiently agile to leap from the automobile when  it was still making good speed. He did not want Mr. Damon to approach  too close to the burning car, for there might be an explosion. At the  same time, he rather discounted the risk to himself, for he ran right  in, while the two men, who had leaped from the blazing machine, hurried  to a safe distance.    Tom held in readiness a small hand extinguisher. It was one he had  constructed from an old one found in the shop, but it contained some of  his own chemicals, the original solution having been used at some time  or other. It was the intention of the young inventor to put on the  market a house-size extinguisher after he had disposed of his big  airship invention.    \"Look out there! The gasoline tank may go up!\" cried Field, the small  man with the big voice.    Tom did not answer, but ran in as close as was necessary and began to  play a small stream from his hand extinguisher on the blazing car. He  was thus able to direct the white, frothy chemical better than when he  had shot it from the airship, and in a few seconds only some wisps of  curling smoke remained to tell of the presence of the fire. The  automobile was badly charred, but the damage was not past redemption.    \"Bless my check book! you did the trick, Tom,\" cried Mr. Damon, as he  alighted and came up to congratulate his companion.    \"Yes. But this wasn't much,\" Tom said. \"I didn't use half the charge.  Short circuit?\" he asked Field and Melling who were now returning,  having seen that the danger was passed.    \"I--I guess so,\" replied Melling, in his squeaky voice. \"We--we are  much obliged to you.\"    \"No thanks necessary,\" said Tom, a bit shortly, as he turned to go back  with Mr. Damon to their car. \"It's what any one would do under like  circumstances.\"    \"Only you did it very effectively,\" observed Field.    Tom was wondering if they knew who he was and of his association with  Josephus Baxter. He did not believe the men recognized him as the  person who had been at the Meadow Inn one day with Mary. They had  hardly glanced at him then, he thought.    \"That's a mighty powerful extinguisher you have there, young man,\" said  Melling. \"May I ask the make of it? We ought to carry one like it on  our car,\" he told his companion.    \"It is the Swift Aerial Fire Extinguisher,\" said Tom gravely, with a  glance at Mr. Damon.    \"The Swift--Tom Swift?\" exclaimed Melling. \"Do you mean--\"    \"I am Tom Swift,\" put in the young inventor quickly. \"And this is one  of my inventions. I might add,\" he said slowly, looking first Melling  and then Field full in the face, \"that I was aided in perfecting the  chemical extinguisher by Josephus Baxter.\"    The effect on the two men, whom Tom believed were scoundrels, was  marked.    \"Baxter!\" cried Field.    \"Is he associated with you?\" demanded Melling.    \"Not officially,\" Tom answered, delighted at the chance to \"rub it in,\"  as he expressed it later. \"I have been helping him, and he has been  helping me since he lost his dye formulae in--in your fire!\"    \"Does he say he lost them in the fire of our factory?\" demanded Field  aggressively.    \"He believes he did,\" asserted Tom. \"I helped carry him out of the  laboratory of your place when he was almost dead from suffocation. He  remembers that he had the formulae then, but since has been unable to  find them.\"    \"He'd better be careful how he accuses us!\" blustered Field, in his big  voice.    \"We could have the law on him for that!\" squeaked the bigger Melling.    \"He hasn't accused you,\" said Tom easily. \"He only says the formulae  disappeared during the fire in your place, and he is just wondering,  that is all--just wondering!\"    \"Well, he--we, I--that is, we haven't anything from Baxter that we  didn't pay for,\" declared Field. \"And if he goes about saying such  things he'd better be careful. I am going--\"    But he suddenly became silent as his companion's elbow nudged him. And  then Melling took up the talk, saying:    \"We're much obliged to you, Mr. Swift, for putting out the fire in our  car. But for you it would have been destroyed. And if you ever want to  sell the extinguisher process of yours, you'll find us in the market.  We are going into the dye business on a large scale, and we can always  use new chemical combinations.\"    \"My extinguisher is not for sale,\" said Tom dryly. \"Come on, Mr. Damon.  We can take you into town, I suppose,\" Tom went on, looking at his  eccentric friend for confirmation, and finding it in a nod. \"But I  doubt if we could tow you, as we are in a hurry, and--\"    \"Oh, thank you, we'll look over our machine before we leave it,\" said  Melling. \"It may be that we can get it to go.\"    Tom doubted this, after a look at the charred section, but he easily  understood the dislike of the men, upon whose heads he had heaped coals  of fire, to ride with him and Mr. Damon.    So Field and Melling were left standing in the road near their stranded  car, which, but for Tom Swift's prompt action, would have been only a  heap of ruins.    Tom first visited the man who had a candy machine, in which the owner  wanted to interest Mr. Damon. After seeing a demonstration and giving  his opinion, he attended to his own affairs, in which his hand  extinguisher played a part. Then he called on Mary Nestor at her  relative's home.    \"Oh, but it's good to see you again, Tom!\" cried Mary, after the first  greeting. \"What have you been doing, and what's all that white stuff on  your coat?\"    \"Fire extinguisher chemical,\" Tom answered, and he related what had  happened.    \"What's the matter with your aunt, Mary? She seems worried about  something,\" he said, after the aunt with whom Mary was staying had come  in, greeted Tom briefly, and gone out again.    \"Oh, she and Uncle Jasper are worried over money matters, I believe,\"  Mary said. \"Uncle Jasper invested heavily in the Landmark Building  here, and now, I understand, it is discovered that it was put up in  violation of the building laws--something about not being fire-proof.  Uncle Jasper is likely to lose considerable money.    \"It isn't that it will make him so very poor,\" Mary went on.  \"But  Uncle Barton Keith--you remember you went on the undersea search with  him--Uncle Barton warned Uncle Jasper not to go into the Landmark  Building scheme.\"    \"And Uncle Jasper did, I take it,\" said Tom.    \"Yes. And now he's sorry, for not only may he lose money, but Uncle  Barton will laugh at him, and Uncle Jasper hates that worse than losing  a lot. But tell me about yourself, Tom. What have you been doing? And  is Eradicate going to get better?\"    \"I hope so,\" Tom said. \"As for me--\"    But he was interrupted by loud voices in the hall. He recognized the  tones of Mary's Uncle Jasper saying:    \"They're scoundrels, that's what they are! Just plain scoundrels! When  I accuse them of swindling me and others in that Landmark Building deal  they have the nerve to ask me to invest money in some secret dye  formulae they claim will revolutionize the industry! Bah! They're  scoundrels, that's what they are--Field and Melling are scoundrels, and  I'm going to have them arrested!\"          CHAPTER XVII    A TOWN BLAZE      Mary's uncle, Jasper Blake, always an impetuous man, opened the door so  quickly that Tom, who was standing near it talking to Mary, barely had  time to move aside.    \"Oh, Tom, excuse me! Didn't see you!\" bruskly went on Mr. Blake. \"But  this thing has gotten on my nerves and I guess I'm a bit wrought up.    \"There isn't any guessing about it, Uncle Jasper,\" said Mary, with a  laugh and a look at Tom to warn him not to tell"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13635"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 1, No. 1 (#16)"],[1,"may happen or not happen further east, England, France, and  Germany solemnly pledge themselves to maintain the internal peace of the  west of Europe, and renounce absolutely all alliances and engagements  that bind them to join any Power outside the combination in military  operations, whether offensive or defensive, against one inside it. We  must get rid of the monstrous situation that produced the present war.  France made an alliance with Russia as a defence against Germany.  Germany made an alliance with Austria as a defence against Russia.  England joined the Franco-Russian alliance as a defence against Germany  and Austria. The result was that Germany became involved in a quarrel  between Austria and Russia. Having no quarrel with France, and only a  second-hand quarrel with Russia, she was, nevertheless, forced to attack  France in order to disable her before she could strike Germany from  behind when Germany was fighting France's ally, Russia. And this attack  on France forced England to come to the rescue of England's ally,  France. Not one of the three nations (as distinguished from their tiny  Junker-Militarist cliques) wanted to fight; for England had nothing to  gain and Germany had everything to lose, whilst France had given up hope  of her Alsace-Lorraine _revanche_, and would certainly not have hazarded  a war for it. Yet because Russia, who has a great deal to gain by  victory and nothing except military prestige to lose by defeat, had a  quarrel with Austria over Servia, she has been able to set all three  western friends and neighbours shedding \"rivers of blood\" from one  another's throats; an outrageous absurdity. Fifty years ago the notion  of England helping Russia and Japan to destroy Germany would have seemed  as suicidal as Canada helping the Apaches to destroy the United States  of America; and though we now think much better of the Japanese (and  also, by the way, of the Apaches), that does not make us any the more  patient with the man who burns down his own street because he admires  the domestic architecture of Yokohama, especially when the fire  presently spreads to the cathedral of Rheims. It is bad enough that we  should have betrayed oriental Persia to oriental Russia as we did (and  get nothing for our pains but what we deserved); but when it comes to  sacrificing occidental Germany to her as well, we are sharpening a knife  for our own occidental throat. The Russian Government is the open enemy  of every liberty we boast of. Charles I.'s unsuccessful attempt to  arrest five members of the House of Commons for disagreeing with him is  ancient history here: it occurred 272 years ago; but the Tsar's  successful attempt to arrest thirty members of the Duma and to punish  them as dangerous criminals is a fact of to-day. Under Russian  government people whose worst crime is to find _The Daily News_ a  congenial newspaper are hanged, flogged, or sent to Siberia as a matter  of daily routine; so that before 1906 even the articles in _The Times_  on such events as the assassinations of Bobrikoff and the Grand Duke  were simply polite paraphrases of \"Serve him right.\" It may be asked why  our newspapers have since ceased to report examples of Russia's  disregard of the political principles we are supposed to stand for. The  answer is simple. It was in 1906 that we began to lend Russia money, and  Russia began to advertise in _The Times_. Since then she has been  welcome to flog and hang her H.G. Wellses and Lloyd Georges by the dozen  without a word of remonstrance from our plutocratic Press, provided the  interest is paid punctually. Russia has been embraced in the large  charity of cosmopolitan capital, the only charity that does not begin at  home.      *The Russian Russians and Their Prussian Tsars.*    And here I must save my face with my personal friends who are either  Russians or discoverers of the soul of the Russian people. I hereby  declare to Sasha Kropotkin and Cunninghame Graham that my heart is with  their Russia, the Russia of Tolstoy and Turgenieff and Dostoieffsky, of  Gorki and Tchekoff, of the Moscow Art Theatre and the Drury Lane Ballet,  of Peter Kropotkin and all the great humanitarians, great artists, and  charming people whom their very North German Tsars exile and imprison  and flog and generally do what in them lies to suppress and abolish. For  the sake of Russian Russia, I am prepared to strain every point in  Prussian Russia's favour. I grant that the Nihilists, much as we loved  them, were futile romantic people who could have done nothing if  Alexander II. had abdicated and offered them the task of governing  Russia instead of persecuting them and being finally blown to bits by  them. I grant that the manners of the Fins to the Russians are described  as insufferable both by the Swedes and the Russians, and that we never  listened to the Russian side of that story. I am ready to grant Gilbert  Murray's plea that the recent rate of democratic advance has been  greater in Russia than anywhere else in Europe, though it does remind me  a little of the bygone days when the Socialists, scoring 20 votes at one  general election and forty at the next, were able to demonstrate that  their gain of 100 per cent. was immensely in excess of the wretched two  or three per cent. that was the best the Unionists or Liberals could  shew. I am willing to forget how short a time it is since Sir Henry  Campbell-Bannerman said: \"The Duma is dead: long live the Duma!\" and  since we refused to allow the Tsar to land in England when his ship was  within gangway's length of our shore, on which occasion I myself held up  the Anglo-Russian agreement for the partition of Persia to the  execration of a crowd in Trafalgar Square, whilst our Metropolitan  Police snatched the _l'sarbeleidigend_ English newspapers from the  sellers and tore them up precisely in the Cossack manner. I have an  enormous relish for the art of Russia; I perceive a spirit in Russia  which is the natural antidote to Potsdamnation; and I like most of the  Russians I know quite unaffectedly. I could find it in my heart to  reproach the Kaiser for making war on the Russia of these delightful  people, just as I like to think that at this very moment good Germans  may be asking him how he can bring himself to discharge shrapnel at the  England of Bernard Shaw and Cunninghame Graham. History may not forgive  him for it; but the practical point at the moment is that he does it,  and no doubt attributes the perfidy of England to the popularity of our  works. And as we have to take the Kaiser as we find him, and not as the  Hohenzollern legend glorifies him, I have to take the Tsar as I find  him. When we fight the Kaiser we are not fighting Bach and Wagner and  Strauss, to whom we have just joyfully surrendered without a blow at the  battle of Queen's Hall, but all the forces in Germany that made things  hard for Wagner and Strauss. And when we fight for the Tsar we are not  fighting for Tolstoy and Gorki, but for the forces that Tolstoy  thundered against all his life and that would have destroyed him had he  not been himself a highly connected Junker as well as a revolutionary  Christian. And if I doubt whether the Tsar would feel comfortable as a  member of a Democratic League of Peace, I am not doubting the good  intent of Kropotkin: I am facing the record of Kropotkin's imperial  jailer, and standing on the proud fact that England is the only country  in Europe, not excepting even France, in which Kropotkin has been  allowed to live a free man, and had his birthday celebrated by public  meetings all over the country, and his articles welcomed by the leading  review. In point of fact, it is largely on Kropotkin's account that I  regard the Tsar as a gentleman of slightly different views to President  Wilson, and hate the infamous tyranny of which he is the figurehead as I  hate the devil. And I know that practically all our disinterested and  thoughtful supporters of the war feel deeply uneasy about the Russian  alliance. At all events, I should be trifling grossly with the facts of  the situation if I pretended that the most absolute autocracy in Europe,  commanding an inexhaustible army in an invincible country with a  dominion stretching from the Baltic to the Pacific, may not, if it  achieves a military success against the most dreaded military Power in  Europe, be stirred to ambitions far more formidable to western liberty  and human welfare than those of which Germany is now finding out the  vanity after worrying herself and everyone else with them for forty  years. When all is said that can be said for Russia, the fact remains  that a forcibly Russianized German province would be just such another  open sore in Europe as Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, Macedonia or Ireland. It  is useless to dream of guarantees: if Russia undertook to govern  democratically she would not be able to redeem her promise: she would do  better with primitive Communism. Her city populations may be as capable  of Democracy as our own (it is, alas! not saying much); but the  overwhelming mass of peasants to whom the Tsar is a personal God will  for a long time to come make his bureaucracy irresistible. As against  Russian civilization German and Austrian civilization is our  civilization: there is no getting over that. A constitutional kingship  of Poland and a sort of Caliphate of the Slavs in remapped southeastern  Europe, with that access to warm sea water which is Russia's common  human right, valid against all Balances of Power and Keys to India and  the like, must be her reward for her share in the war, even if we have  to nationalize Constantinople to secure it to her. But it cannot be too  frankly said at the outset that any attempt to settle Europe on the  basis of the present hemming in of a consolidated Germany and German  Austria by a hostile combination of Russia and the extreme states  against it, would go to"]]]
