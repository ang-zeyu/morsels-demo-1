I do hope the ice cream will be frozen hard.  The Sunshine Sponge Cake, which I baked from a recipe the Professor's  wife gave me, is light as a feather. 'Tis Ralph's favorite cake. Let's  see; besides Ralph there are coming all the Schmidts, Lucy Robbins,  the school teacher, and Sibylla entertains her Jake in the kitchen. I  promised to treat him to ice cream; Sibylla was so good about helping  me crack the ice to use for freezing the cream. We shall have an 'Old  Song Evening' that will amuse every one.\"    Quite early, as is the custom in the country, the guests for the  evening arrived; and both Mary and Aunt Sarah felt fully repaid for  their hard work of the past weeks by the pleasure John Landis evinced  at the changed appearance of the room.    The Professor's wife said, \"It scarcely seems possible to have changed  the old room so completely.\"    Aunt Sarah replied, \"Paint and paper do wonders when combined with  good taste, furnished by Mary.\"    During the evening one might have been forgiven for thinking Professor  Schmidt disloyal to the Mother Country (he having been born and  educated in Heidelberg) had you overheard him speaking to Ralph on his  favorite subject, the \"Pennsylvania German.\" During a lull in the  general conversation in the room Mary heard the Professor remark to  Ralph: \"The Pennsylvania Germans are a thrifty, honest and industrious  class of people, many of whom have held high offices. The first  Germans to come to America as colonists in Pennsylvania were, as a  rule, well to do. Experts, when examining old documents of Colonial  days, after counting thousands of signatures, found the New York  'Dutch' and the Pennsylvania 'Germans' were above the average in  education in those days. Their dialect, the so-called 'Pennsylvania  German' or 'Dutch,' as it is erroneously called by many, is a dialect  which we find from the Tauber Grund to Frankfurt, A.M. As the German  language preponderated among the early settlers, the language of  different elements, becoming amalgamated, formed a class of people  frequently called 'Pennsylvania Dutch'.\"    Professor Harbaugh, D.D., has written some beautiful poems in  Pennsylvania German which an eminent authority, Professor Kluge, a  member of the Freiburg University, Germany, has thought worthy to be  included among the classics. They are almost identical with the poems  written by Nadler in Heidelberger Mundart, or dialect.    Mary, who had been listening intently to the Professor, said, when he  finished talking to Ralph: \"Oh, please, do repeat one of Professor  Harbaugh's poems for us.\"    He replied, \"I think I can recall several stanzas of 'Das Alt  Schulhaus an der Krick.' Another of Professor Harbaugh's poems, and I  think one of the sweetest I have ever read, is 'Heemweeh.' Both poems  are published in his book entitled 'Harbaugh's Harfe,' in Pennsylvania  German dialect, and possess additional interest from the fact that the  translations of these poems, in the latter part of the same book, were  made by the author himself.\"    \"Oh, do repeat all that you remember of both the poems,\" begged Mary.    The Professor consented, saying: \"As neither you nor Mr. Jackson  understand the Pennsylvania German dialect, I shall translate them  for you, after repeating what I remember. 'Heemweeh' means  Homesickness, but first I shall give you 'Das Alt Schulhaus an der  Krick'.\"      [A]DAS ALT SCHULHAUS AN DER KRICK.

Used by  permission.]    THE OLD SCHOOL-HOUSE AT THE CREEK.        Today it is just twenty years,        Since I began to roam;      Now, safely back, I stand once more,      Before the quaint old school-house door,        Close by my father's home.        I've been in many houses since,        Of marble built, and brick;      Though grander far, their aim they miss,      To lure heart's old love from this        Old school-house at the creek.               *       *       *       *       *        The white-oak stands before the door,        And shades the roof at noon;      The grape-vine, too, is fresh and green;      The robin's nest!--Ah, hark!--I ween        That is the same old tune!               *       *       *       *       *         'Twas here I first attended school,        When I was very small;      There was the Master on his stool,      There was his whip and there his rule--        I seem to see it all.        The long desks ranged along the walls,        With books and inkstands crowned;      Here on this side the large girls sat,      And there the tricky boys on that--        See! how they peep around!               *       *       *       *       *        Ye, who shall live when I am dead--        Write down my wishes quick--      Protect it, love it, let it stand,      A way-mark in this changing land--        That school-house at the creek.      HEEMWEH.        Ich wees net was die Ursach is--        Wees net, warum ich's dhu:      'N jedes Johr mach ich der Weg        Der alte Heemet zu;      Hab weiter nix zu suche dort--        Kee' Erbschaft un kee' Geld;      Un doch treibt mich des Heemgefiehl        So schtark wie alle Welt;      Nor'd schtart ich ewe ab un geh,        Wie owe schun gemeldt.

Wer mecht es wisse--sag?    HOME-SICK NESS.        I know not what the reason is:       Where'er I dwell or roam,      I make a pilgrimage each year,       To my old childhood home.      Have nothing there to give or get--        No legacy, no gold--      Yet by some home-attracting power        I'm evermore controlled;      This is the way the homesick do,        I often have been told.               *       *       *       *       *        As nearer to the spot I come        More sweetly am I drawn;      And something in my heart begins        To urge me faster on.      Ere quite I've reached the last hilltop--        You'll smile at me, I ween!--      I stretch myself high as I can,        To catch the view serene--      The dear old stone house through the trees        With shutters painted green!               *       *       *       *       *        How do I love those poplar trees;        What tall and stalely things!      See! on the top of one just now        A starling sits and sings.      He'll fall!--the twig bends with his weight!        He likes that danger best.      I see the red upon his wings,--        Dark shining is the rest.

I know my little domestic details will not prove  wholly uninteresting to you; for well I am assured that a mother's eye  is never weary with reading lines traced by the hand of an absent and  beloved child.    After some difficulty we succeeded in hiring a waggon and span (i.e.  pair abreast) of stout horses to convey us and our luggage through the  woods to the banks of one of the lakes, where S------ had appointed to  ferry us across. There was no palpable road, only a blaze on the other  side, encumbered by fallen trees, and interrupted by a great cedar  swamp, into which one might sink up to one's knees, unless we took the  precaution to step along the trunks of the mossy, decaying timbers, or  make our footing sure on some friendly block of granite or limestone.  What is termed in bush language a _blaze_, is nothing more than notches  or slices cut off the bark of the trees, to mark out the line of road.  The boundaries of the different lots are often marked by a blazed tree,  also the concession-lines*. These blazes are of as much use as finger-  posts of a dark night.    [* These concession-lines are certain divisions of the townships; these  are again divided into so many lots of 200 acres. The concession-lines  used to be marked by a wide avenue being chopped, so as to form a road  of communication between them; but this plan was found too troublesome;  and in a few years the young growth of timber so choked the opening,  that it was of little use. The lately-surveyed townships, I believe, are  only divided by blazed lines.]    The road we were compelled to take lay over the Peterborough plains, in  the direction of the river; the scenery of which pleased me much, though  it presents little appearance of fertility, with the exception of two or  three extensive clearings.    About three miles above Peterborough the road winds along the brow of a  steep ridge, the bottom of which has every appearance of having been  formerly the bed of a lateral branch of the present river, or perhaps  some small lake, which has been diverted from its channel, and merged in  the Otanabee.    On either side of this ridge there is a steep descent; on the right the  Otanabee breaks upon you, rushing with great velocity over its rocky  bed, forming rapids in miniature resembling those of the St. Laurence;  its dark, frowning woods of sombre pine give a grandeur to the scenery  that is very impressive. On the left lies below you a sweet secluded  dell of evergreens, cedar, hemlock, and pine, enlivened by a few  deciduous trees. Through this dell there is a road-track leading to a  fine cleared farm, the green pastures of which were rendered more  pleasing by the absence of the odious stumps that disfigure the  clearings in this part of the country. A pretty bright stream flows  through the low meadow that lies at the foot of the hill, which you  descend suddenly close by a small grist-mill that is worked by the  waters, just where they meet the rapids of the river.    [Illustration: Road through a Pine Forest]    I called this place \"Glen Morrison,\" partly from the remembrance of the  lovely Glen Morrison of the Highlands, and partly because it was the  name of the settler that owned the spot.    Our progress was but slow on account of the roughness of the road, which  is beset with innumerable obstacles in the shape of loose blocks of  granite and limestone, with which the lands on the banks of the river  and lakes abound; to say nothing of fallen trees, big roots, mud-holes,  and corduroy bridges, over which you go jolt, jolt, jolt, till every  bone in your body feels as if it were going to be dislocated. An  experienced bush-traveller avoids many hard thumps by rising up or  clinging to the sides of his rough vehicle.    As the day was particularly fine, I often quitted the waggon and walked  on with my husband for a mile or so.    We soon lost sight entirely of the river, and struck into the deep  solitude of the forest, where not a sound disturbed the almost awful  stillness that reigned around us. Scarcely a leaf or bough was in  motion, excepting at intervals we caught the sound of the breeze  stirring the lofty heads of the pine-trees, and wakening a hoarse and  mournful cadence. This, with the tapping of the red-headed and grey  woodpeckers on the trunk of the decaying trees, or the shrill whistling  cry of the little striped squirrel, called by the natives \"chitmunk,\"  was every sound that broke the stillness of the wild. Nor was I less  surprised at the absence of animal life. With the exception of the  aforesaid chitmunk, no living thing crossed our path during our long  day's journey in the woods.    In these vast solitudes one would naturally be led to imagine that the  absence of man would have allowed Nature's wild denizens to have  abounded free and unmolested; but the contrary seems to be the case.  Almost all wild animals are more abundant in the cleared districts than  in the bush. Man's industry supplies their wants at an easier rate than  seeking a scanty subsistence in the forest.    You hear continually of depredations committed by wolves, bears,  racoons, lynxes, and foxes, in the long-settled parts of the province.  In the backwoods the appearance of wild beasts is a matter of much rarer  occurrence.    I was disappointed in the forest trees, having pictured to myself hoary  giants almost primeval with the country itself, as greatly exceeding in  majesty of form the trees of my native isles, as the vast lakes and  mighty rivers of Canada exceed the locks and streams of Britain.    There is a want of picturesque beauty in the woods. The young growth of  timber alone has any pretension of elegance of form, unless I except the  hemlocks, which are extremely light and graceful, and of a lovely  refreshing tint of green. Even when winter has stripped the forest it is  still beautiful and verdant. The young beeches too are pretty enough,  but you miss that fantastic bowery shade that is so delightful in our  parks and woodlands at home.    There is no appearance of venerable antiquity in the Canadian woods.  There are no ancient spreading oaks that might be called the patriarchs  of the forest. A premature decay seems to be their doom. They are  uprooted by the storm, and sink in their first maturity, to give place  to a new generation that is ready to fill their places.    The pines are certainly the finest trees. In point of size there are  none to surpass them. They tower above all the others, forming a dark  line that may be distinguished for many miles. The pines being so much  loftier than the other trees, are sooner uprooted, as they receive the  full and unbroken force of the wind in their tops; thus it is that the  ground is continually strewn with the decaying trunks of huge pines.  They also seem more liable to inward decay, and blasting from lightning,  and fire. Dead pines are more frequently met with than any other tree.    Much as I had seen and heard of the badness of the roads in Canada, I  was not prepared for such a one as we travelled along this day: indeed,  it hardly deserved the name of a road, being little more than an opening  hewed out through the woods, the trees being felled and drawn aside, so  as to admit a wheeled carriage passing along.    The swamps and little forest streams, that occasionally gush across the  path, are rendered passable by logs placed side by side. From the ridgy  and striped appearance of these bridges they are aptly enough termed  corduroy.    Over these abominable corduroys the vehicle jolts, jumping from log to  log, with a shock that must be endured with as good a grace as possible.  If you could bear these knocks, and pitiless thumpings and bumpings,  without wry faces, your patience and philosophy would far exceed mine;--  sometimes I laughed because I would not cry.    Imagine you see me perched up on a seat composed of carpet-bags, trunks,  and sundry packages, in a vehicle little better than a great rough deal  box set on wheels, the sides being merely pegged in so that more than  once I found myself in rather an awkward predicament, owing to the said  sides jumping out. In the very midst of a deep mud-hole out went the  front board, and with the shock went the teamster (driver), who looked  rather confounded at finding himself lodged just in the middle of a  slough as bad as the \"Slough of Despond.\" For my part, as I could do no  good, I kept my seat, and patiently awaited the restoration to order.  This was soon effected, and all went on well again till a jolt against a  huge pine-tree gave such a jar to the ill-set vehicle, that one of the  boards danced out that composed the bottom, and a sack of flour and bag  of salted pork, which was on its way to a settler's, whose clearing we  had to pass in the way, were ejected. A good teamster is seldom taken  aback by such trifles as these.    He is, or should be, provided with an axe. No waggon, team, or any other  travelling equipage should be unprovided with an instrument of this  kind; as no one can answer for the obstacles that may impede his  progress in the bush. The disasters we met fortunately required but  little skill in remedying. The sides need only a stout peg, and the  loosened planks that form the bottom being quickly replaced, away you go  again over root, stump, and stone, mud-hole, and corduroy; now against  the trunk of some standing tree, now mounting over some fallen one, with  an impulse that would annihilate any lighter equipage than a Canadian  waggon, which is admirably fitted by its very roughness for such roads  as we have in the bush.    The sagacity of the horses of this country is truly admirable. Their  patience in surmounting the difficulties they have to encounter, their  skill in avoiding the holes and stones, and in making their footing sure  over the round and"]]]
