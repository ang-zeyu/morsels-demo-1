It may be added that Africa has  a rich fauna and flora, much mineral wealth, and a physical  configuration that, in respect to its interior, though not to its  coasts, is highly diversified; so that it may be doubted whether the  natives have reached as high a pitch of indigenous culture as the  resources of the environment, considered by itself, might seem to  warrant. If the use of iron was invented in Africa, as some believe,  it would only be another proof that opportunity is nothing apart from  the capacity to grasp it.    Of the Australian aborigines something has been said already. Apart  from the Negrito or Negro strain in their blood, they are usually held  to belong to that pre-Dravidian stock represented by various jungle  tribes in southern India and by the Veddas of Ceylon, connecting links  between the two areas being the Sakai of the Malay Peninsula and East  Sumatra, and the Toala of Celebes. It may be worth observing, also,  that pre-historic skulls of the Neanderthal type find their nearest  parallels in modern Australia. We are here in the presence of some  very ancient dispersal, from what centre and in what direction it is  hard to imagine. In Australia these early colonists found pleasant,  if somewhat lightly furnished, lodgings. In particular there were no  dangerous beasts; so that hunting was hardly calculated to put a man  on his mettle, as in more exacting climes. Isolation, and the  consequent absence of pressure from human intruders, is another fact  in the situation. Whatever the causes, the net result was that, despite  a very fair environment, away from the desert regions of the interior,  man on the whole stagnated. In regard to material comforts and  conveniences, the rudeness of their life seems to us appalling. On  the other hand, now that we are coming to know something of the inner  life and mental history of the Australians, a somewhat different  complexion is put upon the state of their culture. With very plain  living went something that approached to high thinking; and we must  recognize in this case, as in others, what might be termed a  differential evolution of culture, according to which some elements  may advance, whilst others stand still, or even decay.    To another and a very different people, namely, the Polynesians, the  same notion of a differential evolution may be profitably applied.  They were in the stone-age when first discovered, and had no bows and  arrows. On the other hand, with coco-nut, bananas and bread-fruit,  they had abundant means of sustenance, and were thoroughly at home  in their magnificent canoes. Thus their island-life was rich in ease  and variety; and, whilst rude in certain respects, they were almost  civilized in others. Their racial affinities are somewhat complex.  What is almost certain is that they only occupied the Eastern Pacific  during the course of the last 1500 years or so. They probably came  from Indonesia, mixing to a slight extent with Melanesians on their  way. How the proto-Polynesians came into existence in Indonesia is  more problematic. Possibly they were the result of a mixture between  long-headed immigrants from eastern India, and round-headed Mongols  from Indo-China and the rest of south-eastern Asia, from whom the  present Malays are derived.           *       *       *       *       *    We have completed our very rapid regional survey of the world; and  what do we find? By no means is it case after case of one region  corresponding to one type of man and to one type of culture. It might  be that, given persistent physical conditions of a uniform kind, and  complete isolation, human life would in the end conform to these  conditions, or in other words stagnate. No one can tell, and no one  wants to know, because as a matter of fact no such environmental  conditions occur in this world of ours. Human history reveals itself  as a bewildering series of interpenetrations. What excites these  movements? Geographical causes, say the theorists of one idea. No doubt  man moves forward partly because nature kicks him behind. But in the  first place some types of animal life go forward under pressure from  nature, whilst others lie down and die. In the second place man has  an accumulative faculty, a social memory, whereby he is able to carry  on to the conquest of a new environment whatever has served him in  the old. But this is as it were to compound environments--a process  that ends by making the environment coextensive with the world.  Intelligent assimilation of the new by means of the old breaks down  the provincial barriers one by one, until man, the cosmopolitan animal  by reason of his hereditary constitution, develops a cosmopolitan  culture; at first almost unconsciously, but later on with  self-conscious intent, because he is no longer content to live, but  insists on living well.    As a sequel to this brief examination of the geographic control  considered by itself it would be interesting, if space allowed, to  append a study of the distribution of the arts and crafts of a more  obviously economic and utilitarian type. If the physical environment  were all in all, we ought to find the same conditions evoking the same  industrial appliances everywhere, without the aid of suggestions from  other quarters. Indeed, so little do we know about the conditions  attending the discovery of the arts of life that gave humanity its  all-important start--the making of fire, the taming of animals, the  sowing of plants, and so on--that it is only too easy to misread our  map. We know almost nothing of those movements of peoples, in the course  of which a given art was brought from one part of the world to another.  Hence, when we find the art duly installed in a particular place, and  utilizing the local product, the bamboo in the south, let us say, or  the birch in the north, as it naturally does, we easily slip into the  error of supposing that the local products of themselves called the  art into existence. Similar needs, we say, have generated similar  expedients. No doubt there is some truth in this principle; but I doubt  if, on the whole, history tends to repeat itself in the case of the  great useful inventions. We are all of us born imitators, but inventive  genius is rare.    Take the case of the early palaeoliths of the drift type. From Egypt,  Somaliland, and many other distant lands come examples which Sir John  Evans finds \"so identical in form and character with British specimens  that they might have been manufactured by the same hands.\" And  throughout the palaeolithic age in Europe the very limited number and  regular succession of forms testifies to the innate conservatism of  man, and the slow progress of invention. And yet, as some American  writers have argued--who do not find that the distinction between  chipped palaeoliths and polished neoliths of an altogether later age  applies equally well to the New World--it was just as easy to have  got an edge by rubbing as by flaking. The fact remains that in the  Old World human inventiveness moved along one channel rather than  another, and for an immense lapse of time no one was found to strike  out a new line. There was plenty of sand and water for polishing, but  it did not occur to their minds to use it.    To wind up this chapter, however, I shall glance at the distribution,  not of any implement connected directly and obviously with the  utilization of natural products, but of a downright oddity, something  that might easily be invented once only and almost immediately dropped  again. And yet here it is all over the world, going back, we may  conjecture, to very ancient times, and implying interpenetrations of  bygone peoples, of whose wanderings perhaps we may never unfold the  secret. It is called the \"bull-roarer,\" and is simply a slat of wood  on the end of a string, which when whirled round produces a rather  unearthly humming sound. Will the anthropo-geographer, after studying  the distribution of wood and stringy substances round the globe,  venture to prophesy that, if man lived his half a million years or  so over again, the bull-roarer would be found spread about very much  where it is to-day? \"Bull-roarer\" is just one of our local names for  what survives now-a-days as a toy in many an old-fashioned corner of  the British Isles, where it is also known as boomer, buzzer, whizzer,  swish, and so on. Without going farther afield we can get a hint of  the two main functions which it seems to have fulfilled amongst ruder  peoples. In Scotland it is, on the one hand, sometimes used to \"ca'  the cattle hame.\" A herd-boy has been seen to swing a bull-roarer of  his own making, with the result that the beasts were soon running  frantically towards the byre. On the other hand, it is sometimes  regarded there as a \"thunner-spell,\" a charm against thunder, the  superstition being that like cures like, and whatever makes a noise  like thunder will be on good terms, so to speak, with the real thunder.    As regards its uses in the rest of the world, it may be said at once  that here and there, in Galicia in Europe, in the Malay Peninsula in  Asia, and amongst the Bushmen in Africa, it is used to drive or scare  animals, whether tame or wild. And this, to make a mere guess, may  have been its earliest use, if utilitarian contrivances can generally  claim historical precedence, as is by no means certain. As long as  man hunted with very inferior weapons, he must have depended a good  deal on drives, that either forced the game into a pitfall, or rounded  them up so as to enable a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17287"],[0,"History of France (#16)"],[1," Acre  against him. He hurried home to France on finding that the Directory had  begun a fresh European war, seizing Switzerland, and forcing it to give  up its treasures and become a republic on their model, and carrying the  Pope off into captivity. All the European Powers had united against  them, and Lombardy had been recovered chiefly by Russian aid; so that  Buonaparte, on the ground that a nation at war needed a less cumbrous  government than a Directory, contrived to get himself chosen First  Consul, with two inferiors, in 1799.      7. The Consulate.--A great course of victories followed in Italy,  where Buonaparte commanded in person, and in Germany under Moreau.  Austria and Russia were forced to make peace, and England was the only  country that still resisted him, till a general peace was made at Amiens  in 1803; but it only lasted for a year, for the French failed to  perform the conditions, and began the war afresh. In the mean time  Buonaparte had restored religion and order, and so entirely mastered  France that, in 1804, he was able to form the republic into an empire,  and affecting to be another Charles the Great, he caused the Pope to say  mass at his coronation, though he put the crown on his own head. A  concordat with the Pope reinstated the clergy, but altered the division  of the dioceses, and put the bishops and priests in the pay of the  State.      8. The Empire.--The union of Italy to this new French Empire caused a  fresh war with all Europe. The Austrian army, however, was defeated at  Ulm and Austerlitz, the Prussians were entirely crushed at Jena, and the  Russians fought two terrible but almost drawn battles at Eylau and  Friedland. Peace was then made with all three at Tilsit, in 1807, the  terms pressing exceedingly hard upon Prussia. Schemes of invading  England were entertained by the Emperor, but were disconcerted by the  destruction of the French and Spanish fleets by Nelson at Trafalgar.  Spain was then in alliance with France; but Napoleon, treacherously  getting the royal family into his hands, seized their kingdom, making  his brother Joseph its king. But the Spaniards would not submit, and  called in the English to their aid. The Peninsular War resulted in a  series of victories on the part of the English under Wellington, while  Austria, beginning another war, was again so crushed that the Emperor  durst not refuse to give his daughter in marriage to Napoleon. However,  in 1812, the conquest of Russia proved an exploit beyond Napoleon's  powers. He reached Moscow with his Grand Army, but the city was burnt  down immediately after his arrival, and he had no shelter or means of  support. He was forced to retreat, through a fearful winter, without  provisions and harassed by the Cossacks, who hung on the rear and cut  off the stragglers, so that his whole splendid army had become a mere  miserable, broken, straggling remnant by the time the survivors reached  the Prussian frontier. He himself had hurried back to Paris as soon as  he found their case hopeless, to arrange his resistance to all  Europe--for every country rose against him on his first disaster--and  the next year was spent in a series of desperate battles in Germany  between him and the Allied Powers. Luetzen and Bautzen were doubtful, but  the two days' battle of Leipzic was a terrible defeat. In the year 1814,  four armies--those of Austria, Russia, England, and Prussia--entered  France at once; and though Napoleon resisted, stood bravely and  skilfully, and gained single battles against Austria and Prussia, he  could not stand against all Europe. In April the Allies entered Paris,  and he was forced to abdicate, being sent under a strong guard to the  little Mediterranean isle of Elba. He had drained France of men by his  constant call for soldiers, who were drawn by conscription from the  whole country, till there were not enough to do the work in the fields,  and foreign prisoners had to be employed; but he had conferred on her  one great benefit in the great code of laws called the \"_Code  Napoleon_,\" which has ever since continued in force.      9. France under Napoleon.--The old laws and customs, varying in  different provinces, had been swept away, so that the field was clear;  and the system of government which Napoleon devised has remained  practically unchanged from that time to this. Everything was made to  depend upon the central government. The Ministers of Religion, of  Justice, of Police, of Education, etc., have the regulation of all  interior affairs, and appoint all who work under them, so that nobody  learns how to act alone; and as the Government has been in fact ever  since dependent on the will of the people of Paris, the whole country is  helplessly in their hands. The army, as in almost all foreign nations,  is raised by conscription--that is, by drawing lots among the young men  liable to serve, and who can only escape by paying a substitute to serve  in their stead; and this is generally the first object of the savings of  a family. All feudal claims had been done away with, and with them the  right of primogeniture; and, indeed, it is not possible for a testator  to avoid leaving his property to be shared among his family, though he  can make some small differences in the amount each receives, and thus  estates are continually freshly divided, and some portions become very  small indeed. French peasants are, however, most eager to own land, and  are usually very frugal, sober, and saving; and the country has gone on  increasing in prosperity and comfort. It is true that, probably from the  long habit of concealing any wealth they might possess, the French  farmers and peasantry care little for display, or what we should call  comfort, and live rough hard-working lives even while well off and with  large hoards of wealth; but their condition has been wonderfully changed  for the better ever since the Revolution. All this has continued under  the numerous changes that have taken place in the forms of government.          CHAPTER VIII.    FRANCE SINCE THE REVOLUTION.      1. The Restoration.--The Allies left the people of France free to  choose their Government, and they accepted the old royal family, who  were on their borders awaiting a recall. The son of Louis XVI. had  perished in the hands of his jailers, and thus the king's next brother,  _Louis XVIII._, succeeded to the throne, bringing back a large emigrant  following. Things were not settled down, when Napoleon, in the spring of  1815, escaped from Elba. The army welcomed him with delight, and Louis  was forced to flee to Ghent. However, the Allies immediately rose in  arms, and the troops of England and Prussia crushed Napoleon entirely at  Waterloo, on the 18th of June, 1815. He was sent to the lonely rock of  St. Helena, in the Atlantic, whence he could not again return to trouble  the peace of Europe. There he died in 1821. Louis XVIII. was restored,  and a charter was devised by which a limited monarchy was established, a  king at the head, and two chambers--one of peers, the other of  deputies, but with a very narrow franchise. It did not, however, work  amiss; till, after Louis's death in 1824, his brother, _Charles X._,  tried to fall back on the old system. He checked the freedom of the  press, and interfered with the freedom of elections. The consequence was  a fresh revolution in July, 1830, happily with little bloodshed, but  which forced Charles X. to go into exile with his grandchild Henry,  whose father, the Duke of Berry, had been assassinated in 1820.      2. Reign of Louis Philippe.--The chambers of deputies offered the  crown to _Louis Philippe_, Duke of Orleans. He was descended from the  regent; his father had been one of the democratic party in the  Revolution, and, when titles were abolished, had called himself Philip  _Egalite_ (Equality). This had not saved his head under the Reign of  Terror, and his son had been obliged to flee and lead a wandering life,  at one time gaining his livelihood by teaching mathematics at a school  in Switzerland. He had recovered his family estates at the Restoration,  and, as the head of the Liberal party, was very popular. He was elected  King of the French, not of France, with a chamber of peers nominated for  life only, and another of deputies elected by voters, whose  qualification was two hundred francs, or eight pounds a year. He did his  utmost to gain the good will of the people, living a simple, friendly  family life, and trying to merit the term of the \"citizen king,\" and in  the earlier years of his reign he was successful. The country was  prosperous, and a great colony was settled in Algiers, and endured a  long and desperate war with the wild Arab tribes. A colony was also  established in New Caledonia, in the Pacific, and attempts were carried  out to compensate thus for the losses of colonial possessions which  France had sustained in wars with England. Discontents, however, began  to arise, on the one hand from those who remembered only the successes  of Buonaparte, and not the miseries they had caused, and on the other  from the working-classes, who declared that the _bourgeois_, or  tradespeople, had gained everything by the revolution of July, but they  themselves nothing. Louis Philippe did his best to gratify and amuse the  people by sending for the remains of Napoleon, and giving him a  magnificent funeral and splendid monument among his old soldiers--the  Invalides; but his popularity was waning. In 1842 his eldest son, the  Duke of Orleans, a favourite with the people, was killed by a fall from  his carriage, and this was another shock to his throne. Two young  grandsons were left; and the king had also several sons, one of whom,  the Duke of Montpensier, he gave in marriage to Louise, the sister and  heiress presumptive to the Queen of Spain; though, by treaty with the  other European Powers, it had been agreed that she should not marry "]]]
