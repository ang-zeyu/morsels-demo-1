A singing-teacher who  does not take pains to acquire a good, delicate touch, and who neglects  to pay constant attention to it, is wanting in the first requirement;  and this is closely connected with the want of \"the three trifles.\"          CHAPTER X.    VISIT AT MRS. N.'S.      MRS. N.  _Her daughter_ FATIMA, _eighteen years old_.  AN AUNT.  DOMINIE.  _Towards the end of the evening, the piano-teacher_, MR. FEEBLE.      DOMINIE (_rather anxiously to Fatima_). Will you do me the favor, Miss,  to play something on the piano? Your aunt has told me a great deal about  your playing.    FATIMA (_smiling graciously_). But, really, the piano is out of  tune,--so my teacher says.    DOMINIE. But does not your teacher attend to having your piano always  kept in tune?    FATIMA. Mamma says it is too expensive to have it tuned so often; it  gets out of tune again so quickly. It is an old, small-legged piano, as  you see: mamma is always saying, when I am older I shall have a  Chickering. The tuner comes regularly once in three months; the time is  not yet up.    DOMINIE. But is your teacher satisfied with the tuning of your piano?    FATIMA. Well, he has got used to it. It is the same with the other  instruments he teaches on.    MRS. N. Now, pet, play us something. Mr. Dominie likes music; he is a  judge of it; his daughters play too.    FATIMA. But what shall I play, mamma?    MRS. N. You have got heaps of notes there. Mr. Dominie, pray select  something.    DOMINIE. But I don't know which pieces Miss Fatima can master, and which  she has now at her fingers' ends.    AUNT. Pray, Mr. Dominie, choose any thing. They are all fine pieces. It  makes no difference to her which she plays.    DOMINIE. But do you play that whole heap?    AUNT. She has played it all. She has played ever since she was ten years  old, and she has a very good teacher. He taught here when my sister used  to accompany her lover's solos on the flute. Oh, those were charming  musical evenings! And the teacher often played the guitar with them  _extempore_. It was just like a concert.    DOMINIE. Indeed! that must have been very fine. Now, Miss, I beg--    FATIMA. But, mamma, just say what I shall play.    DOMINIE. Is not your teacher here this evening? He will know best.    AUNT (_whispers to Dominie_). He is busy this evening, composing some  grand bravoura variations, which are to be dedicated to Fatima on her  eighteenth birthday, the day after to-morrow. You must come to see us on  that day. Fatima will play them at sight.    MRS. N. Fatima, don't hold back any longer. Play \"The Huguenots\" by  Thalberg: that's a very fine piece.    DOMINIE. Pray do! I have not heard it since I heard Thalberg play it.    AUNT (_to Dominie_). Don't you make your daughters play it then? Oh,  that magnificent choral! That brings tears to my eyes! But the dear  child always takes it too fast: her fingers run away with her.    MRS. N. Here it is. Please turn round so that you can see her hands, Mr.  Dominie. You are such a famous teacher, perhaps you can make some  suggestions. (_I was expected only to admire._)    DOMINIE. I don't like to disturb her freedom in playing; but I will turn  round, if you say so.         (_Fatima scurries through the piece excitedly, and plays in a bold       way,--not, however, without ability, but with a feeble touch,       without proper fingering, without tone, without time; and gets over       the first two pages, with her foot always on the pedal, in such a       senseless, indistinct manner that Dominie, in despair, was forced       to interrupt with the remark, \"But you might take the _tempo_ a       little more quietly.\"_)         (_Fatima leans back amazed, and stops playing, looking at her       mother with a contemptuous expression._)    AUNT. It is owing to her great execution, and then, too, her youthful  enthusiasm. Don't you like her natural expression?    FATIMA. My teacher always makes me play it so. It is in that way that I  have learned to play so much at sight.    DOMINIE. But don't you study your pieces?    FATIMA. For the last four years I have played only at sight, so that now  I can get on anywhere in the musical clubs. That is what mamma likes.    DOMINIE. But do you not play any scales and etudes? do you not practise  any exercises?    AUNT. She has not done those things for the last four years. My sister  thinks it is rather a hindrance, and is too pedantic. Her teacher  thinks so too, and he teaches her the fine concert pieces of Doehler,  Liszt, Dreyschock, Willmer, and Thalberg. She learns execution by these.  She has gone through all Thalberg's music; and we have sent to Leipzig  for Willmer's \"Pompa di Festa.\"    DOMINIE. All this shows great enthusiasm, but really a little too much  hot haste.         (_Dominie wishes to continue the conversation, in order to escape       the unpleasant necessity of \"turning round to the piano.\"_)    MRS. N. (_interrupts_). My child, just begin again at the beginning, and  let us enjoy the whole of \"The Huguenots.\" Mr. Dominie likes it.         (_Fatima consents, and hurries through the whole Potpourri with a       confident, conceited air, to the great despair of Dominie. At the       choral, the aunt taps him on the shoulder, and whispers._)    AUNT. Is not that touching? It is a little too fast, you will agree; but  then the execution! Has not the girl a great deal of talent? Just hear!           *       *       *       *       *    But what did Dominie say after the performance was over? He only bowed  stiffly, and what he said to himself will always remain a secret. He  only _felt_.    They go in to supper. All who submitted to hearing the daughter perform  on the badly tuned piano, which was at least a tone and a half too low,  were invited to supper and handsomely treated. The wine was better than  the piano. Presently the teacher, Mr. Feeble, having finished his  birthday bravoura composition, appeared and was introduced. Fatima  whispered to him, giggling, \"I played the whole of 'The Huguenots;' it  went splendidly.\" Mr. Feeble simpered. Dominie and he talked together,  unheard, at the end of the table.           *       *       *       *       *    DOMINIE. The young lady has talent, Mr. Feeble.    MR. FEEBLE. Indeed she has!    DOMINIE. How is it, Mr. Feeble, that she does not combine serious  studies with her playing?    MR. FEEBLE. Oh! I used to make her play exercises by A.E. Mueller, and  some Etudes of Czerny's, and sometimes a few scales. But the child was  so volatile, and had so little perseverance, and was so quick at  learning every thing! And then her mother wanted her to play modern  pieces for parties, and we had to busy ourselves with those. But our  method has borne good fruit, as you can see. Is not it so?    DOMINIE. Do you not think, with firmness and decision, you could have  set Mrs. N. on the right track? Could not you cultivate the mechanical  powers of your pupil, and combine an understanding of the musical  construction of the piece, with her \"playing at sight\"? The young lady,  not to speak of other faults, has no tone on the piano.    MR. FEEBLE. She can use the pedal for that, and, when she is older, she  will acquire more strength; her touch is a little too weak at present.  And, besides, she is not to play in public for money, but only in  company, and because it is the fashion. Indeed, my dear sir, if I  insisted on scales and exercises, I should have very few lessons in this  city. I have a wife and children to support, and my old father, the  former organist, is dependent upon me. You can do all this with your own  children; but think how much time it requires to _study_ the music!         (_The company bid each other \"good-night.\"_)    FATIMA (_flippantly to Dominie_). I believe your daughter Emma is a very  good player; but they say she has not so much talent as your eldest  daughter.    DOMINIE. Indeed! who told you that?          CHAPTER XI.    SECRETS.      _(A Discourse on Piano-Playing, delivered to an Audience of Lady  Pupils.)_    Ladies,--As I am about to make a journey of a few weeks with my  daughters, we will suspend for a short time our musical meetings. On my  return, you will resume them with fresh interest. We will then not only  play and sing together, but occasionally talk upon kindred subjects.  Your friends will be made welcome, provided they are really interested  in simple and noble musical performances, which make no attempt at  display. We will exclude from our circle malicious criticism and idle  curiosity: we require the accompaniment of the violin and 'cello, but  not of those two disturbing elements.    To-day I wish to propound a query in regard to piano-playing, to the  partial solution of which you will perhaps be glad to give some  attention. You may be sure that I shall always speak only upon subjects  which are not even mentioned in the most crowded piano-schools.    _Query._ Why is it that our young, educated ladies, who enjoy the  advantages of sufficient talent, industry, a serious purpose, and all  the necessary aids, are usually dissatisfied with their progress and  with their success in piano-playing?    Their education is a sufficiently careful one, extending to all branches  of knowledge; but their intellectual advancement in music (although it  has been fostered for years, by constantly listening to good music, and  frequently to the performances of distinguished players, and by a  critical comparison of their own performances with these) is still small  in proportion to their power of execution, and to the mechanical  facility which they have acquired. These are certainly essential to a  correct and agreeable rendering of a piece of music: the compositions  which are to be performed ought, however, never to demand the exercise  of all the mechanical skill which has been acquired, for in that case,  by the struggle with mechanical difficulties, only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16667"],[0,"Young Folks' History of Rome (#16)"],[1,"in the towns and cutting off all provisions, he should  wear the enemy out at last. As he always put off a battle, he was called  Cunctator, or the Delayer; but at last he had the Carthaginians enclosed  as in a trap in the valley of the river Vulturnus, and hoped to cut them  off, posting men in ambush to fall on them on their morning's march.  Hannibal guessed that this must be the plan; and at night he had the  cattle in the camp collected, fastened torches to their horns, and drove  them up the hills. The Romans, fancying themselves surrounded by the  enemy, came out of their hiding-places to fall back on the camp, and  Hannibal and his army safely escaped. This mischance made the Romans  weary of the Delayer's policy, and when the year was out, and two  consuls came in, though one of them, Lucius AEmilius Paulus, would have  gone on in the same cautious plan of starving Hannibal out without a  battle, the other, Caius Terentius Varro, who commanded on alternate  days with him, was determined on a battle. Hannibal so contrived that it  was fought on the plain of Cannae, where there was plenty of space to use  his Moorish horse. It was Varro's day of command, and he dashed at the  centre of the enemy; Hannibal opened a space for him, then closed in on  both sides with his terrible horse, and made a regular slaughter of the  Romans. The last time that the consul AEmilius was seen was by a tribune  named Lentulus, who found him sitting on a stone faint and bleeding, and  would have given him his own horse to escape, but AEmilius answered that  he had no mind to have to accuse his comrade of rashness, and had rather  die. A troop of enemies coming up, Lentulus rode off, and looking back,  saw his consul fall, pierced with darts. So many Romans had been killed,  that Hannibal sent to Carthage a basket containing 10,000 of the gold  rings worn by the knights.    [Illustration: ARCHIMEDES.]    Hannibal was only five days' march beyond Rome, and his officers wanted  him to turn back and attack it in the first shock of the defeat, but he  could not expect to succeed without more aid from home, and he wanted to  win over the Greek cities of the south; so he wintered in Campania,  waiting for the fresh troops he expected from Africa or from Spain,  where his brother Mago was preparing an army. But the Carthaginians did  not care about Hannibal's campaigns in Italy, and sent no help; and  Publius Cornelius Scipio and his brother, with a Roman army in Spain,  were watching Mago and preventing him from marching, until at last he  gave them battle and defeated and killed them both. But he was not  allowed to go to Italy to his brother, who, in the meantime, found his  army so unstrung and ill-disciplined in the delightful but languid  Campania, that the Romans declared the luxuries of Capua were their best  allies. He stayed in the south, however, trying to gain the alliance of  the king of Macedon, and stirring up Syracuse to revolt. Marcellus, who  was consul for the third time, was sent to reduce the city, which made a  famous defence, for it contained Archimedes, the greatest mathematician  of his time, who devised wonderful machines for crushing the besiegers  in unexpected ways; but at last Marcellus found a weak part of the walls  and surprised the citizens. He had given orders that Archimedes should  be saved, but a soldier broke into the philosopher's room without  knowing him, and found him so intent on his study that he had never  heard the storming of the city. The man brandished his sword. \"Only  wait,\" muttered Archimedes, \"till I have found out my problem;\" but the  man, not understanding him, killed him.    Hannibal remained in Italy, maintaining himself there with wonderful  skill, though with none of the hopes with which he had set out. His  brother Hasdrubal did succeed in leaving Spain with an army to help him,  but was met on the river Metaurus by Tiberius Claudius Nero, beaten, and  slain. His head was cut off by Nero's order, and thrown into Hannibal's  camp to give tidings of his fate.    Young Scipio, meantime, had been sent to Spain, where he gained great  advantages, winning the friendship of the Iberians, and gaining town  after town till Mago had little left but Gades and the extreme south.  Scipio was one of the noblest of the Romans, brave, pious, and what was  more unusual, of such sweet and winning temper, that it was said of him  that wherever he went he might have been a king.    On returning to Rome, he showed the Senate that the best way to get  Hannibal out of Italy was to attack Africa. Cautious old Fabius doubted,  but Scipio was sent to Sicily, where he made an alliance with  Massinissa, the Moorish king in Africa; and, obtaining leave to carry  out his plan, he was sent thither, and so alarmed Carthage, that  Hannibal was recalled to defend his own country, where he had not been  since he was a child. A great battle took place at Zama between him and  Hannibal, in which Scipio was the conqueror, and the loss of Carthage  was so terrible that the Romans were ready to have marched in on her and  made her their subject, but Scipio persuaded them to be forbearing.  Carthage was to pay an immense tribute, and swear never to make war on  any ally of Rome. And thus ended the Second Punic War, in the year 201.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XX.    THE FIRST EASTERN WAR.    215-183.      Scipio remained in Africa till he had arranged matters and won such a  claim to Massinissa's gratitude that this king of Numidia was sure to  watch over the interests of Rome. Scipio then returned home, and entered  Rome with a grand triumph, all the nobler for himself that he did not  lead Hannibal in his chains. He had been too generous to demand that so  brave an enemy should be delivered up to him. He received the surname of  Africanus, and was one of the most respected and beloved of Romans. He  was the first who began to take up Greek learning and culture, and to  exchange the old Roman ruggedness for the graces of philosophy and  poetry. Indeed the Romans were beginning to have much to do with the  Greeks, and the war they entered upon now was the first for the sake of  spreading their own power. All the former ones had been in self-defence,  and the new one did in fact spring out of the Punic war, for the  Carthaginians had tried to persuade Philip, king of Macedon, to follow  in the track of Pyrrhus, and come and help Hannibal in Southern Italy.  The Romans had kept him off by stirring up the robber AEtolians against  him; and when he began to punish these wild neighbors, the Romans  leagued themselves with the old Greek cities which Macedon oppressed,  and a great war took place.    Titus Quinctius Flaminius commanded in Greece for four years, first as  consul and then as proconsul. His crowning victory was at Cynocephalae,  or the Dogshead Rocks, where he so broke the strength of Macedon that at  the Isthmian games he proclaimed the deliverance of Greece, and in their  joy the people crowded round him with crowns and garlands, and shouted  so loud that birds in the air were said to have dropped down at the  sound.    Macedon had cities in Asia Minor, and the king of Syria's enemy,  Antiochus the Great, hoped to master them, and even to conquer Greece by  the help of Hannibal, who had found himself unable to live in Carthage  after his defeat, and was wandering about to give his services to any  one who was a foe of Rome.    As Rome took the part of Philip, as her subject and ally, there was soon  full scope for his efforts; but the Syrians were such wretched troops  that even Hannibal could do nothing with them, and the king himself  would not attend to his advice, but wasted his time in pleasure in the  isle of Euboea. So the consul Acilius first beat them at Thermopylae, and  then, on Lucius Cornelius Scipio being sent to conduct the war, his  great brother Africanus volunteered to go with him as his lieutenant,  and together they followed Antiochus into Asia Minor, and gained such  advantages that the Syrian was obliged to sue for peace. The Romans  replied by requiring of him to give up all Asia Minor as far as Mount  Tarsus, and in despair he risked a battle in Magnesia, and met with a  total defeat; 80,000 Greeks and Syrians being overthrown by 50,000  Romans. Neither Africanus nor Hannibal were present in this battle,  since the first was ill, and the second was besieged in a city in  Pamphylia; but while terms of peace were being made, the two are said  have met on friendly terms, and Scipio asked Hannibal whom he thought  the greatest of generals. \"Alexander,\" was the answer. \"Whom the next  greatest?\" \"Pyrrhus.\" \"Whom do you rank as the third?\" \"Myself,\" said  Hannibal. \"But if you had beaten me?\" asked Scipio. \"Then I would have  placed myself before Alexander.\"    [Illustration: HANNIBAL]    The Romans insisted that Hannibal should be dismissed by Antiochus,  though Scipio declared that this was ungenerous; but they dreaded his  never-ceasing enmity; and when he took refuge with the king of Bothnia,  they still required that he should be given up or driven a way. On this,  Hannibal, worn-out and disappointed, put an end to his own life by  poison, saying he would rid the Romans of their fear of an old man.    The provinces taken from Antiochus were given to Eumenes, king of  Pergamus, who was to reign over them as tributary to the Romans. Lucius  Scipio received the surname of Asiaticus, and the two brothers returned  to Rome; but they had been too generous and merciful to the conquered to  suit the grasping spirit that had begun to prevail at Rome, and directly  after his triumph Lucius was accused of having taken to himself an undue  share of the spoil. His brother was too indignant at the shameful  accusation to think of letting him justify himself, but tore up his  accounts in the face of the people. The tribune, Naevius, thereupon  spitefully called upon him to give an"]]]
