We could have told the strangers who  came to his aid who he was, and we might even have taken him to the  hospital in the airship.\"    \"Well, it's too late to think of that now,\" returned Mr. Damon.  \"We  had better get into communication with him as soon as we can, and then  send word to his wife and daughter. I hope he isn't badly hurt.\"    Tom hoped so, too, with all his heart.    There was nothing to do but to get back in the runabout and make all  speed for the nearest telephone, and Tom Swift lost little time in  doing this. They found a drug store which was open a little later than  usual, and at once Tom went into the booth and called up the Shopton  hospital. He was well known there, as he and his father were liberal  supporters of the institution, which was a private affair. Many of  Tom's men were treated at the dispensary, and, as accidents were of  more or less frequent occurrence at the works, the young inventor had  frequent occasions to call up the place.    \"Mr. Nestor would ask to be taken there, as it's nearest his home--that  is, if he was able to speak,\" Tom said to Mr. Damon, who agreed with  him. There was a little delay in getting the hospital on the wire, but  when Tom had it, and was talking to the superintendent, he was rather  surprised, to tell the truth, to be told that Mr. Nestor had not been  brought in.    \"We haven't had any accident cases all day, nor to-night, Mr. Swift,\"  the superintendent reported. \"Was this some one special you were  inquiring about?\"    For Tom, determining not to give Mr. Nestor's name, except as a last  resort, had merely inquired whether any recent accident cases had been  brought in.    \"I'll let you know later, Mr. Millard,\" he told the superintendent, not  exactly answering the question. He hung up the receiver, and, opening  the door of the booth, said to Mr. Damon: \"He isn't there.\"    \"Then try Waterfield,\" was the suggestion; and Tom did so, though he  could not imagine why an injured man, such as Mr. Nestor might prove to  be, should be taken as far as Waterfield, when the hospital at Shopton  was nearer.    \"Unless,\" he told Mr. Damon, \"the people which ran down Mary's father  didn't know about our hospital.\"    The reply from the institution in Mr. Damon's home town was just as  discouraging as had been the answer from Shopton. At first, when Tom  inquired, the head nurse had said there was an accident case at that  moment being brought in. Tom was all excitement until she went to  inquire the name and circumstances, and then he learned that it was the  case of a little boy who had fallen downstairs at his home and broken a  leg. There was no record of any one answering the description of Mr.  Nestor having been brought in that evening.    \"Hum! This is getting to be mysterious,\" mused Tom, as he came out of  the booth. \"What shall we do--go back and tell Mrs. Nestor and Mary, or  communicate with the police?\"    \"Why not try the Alexian Hospital?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"That's away over  in Centerford, to be sure, but it's more likely to be known to  passing tourists than either of our institutions around here,  especially if the autoists were strangers.\"    \"That's so,\" agreed Tom. The Alexian Hospital was operated under the  direction of the Brothers of that faith, and was well known in that  part of the state. Often cases of persons who had been injured by  passing automobiles had been taken there for treatment, for, as Mr.  Damon had said, it was well known, and Centerford was the nearest large  city.    \"I can just about see how it happened,\" said Tom. \"They ran Mr. Nestor  down, and stopped to pick him up after they heard his cries for help.  And the Alexian Hospital was the first one they thought of. We should  have called that up first.\"    But once more disappointment awaited the young inventor and his friend.  Word came back over the wire that no accident case, which bore any  resemblance to Mary's father, had been brought in.    \"Well, I'm stumped!\" exclaimed Tom. \"What shall we do now, Mr. Damon?\"    \"Much as I dislike it,\" said the eccentric man who was too much  worried, now, to do any \"blessing,\" which was his favorite expression,  \"I think we ought to communicate with Mrs. Nestor.  She will be very  anxious.\"    \"I guess we'll have to,\" said Tom. \"But wait! I'll call up my house  first, and see if he has gone back there.\"    But Mr. Nestor had not done this, and Mrs. Baggert, who answered the  telephone, said Mary had been calling frantically for Tom, as her  mother was now on the verge of complete collapse.    \"No help for it,\" said Tom, ruefully. \"We've got to tell 'em we have no  news, and can't find him.\"    And, hearing this, Mrs. Nestor did collapse, and a doctor was called in.    Thereupon Tom, who with Mr. Damon had gone back to the Nestor home,  took charge of matters, sending for Mrs. Nestor's sister to come and  stay with her and take charge of the house.    \"You'll need some one to stay with you,\" he told Mary.    \"Yes, I shall,\" she admitted, trying bravely not to give way to her  emotion. \"Oh, Tom, I wish you could stay, too. I'm sure something  dreadful must have happened to poor father. Please stay and help us  find him!\"    \"I will,\" Tom promised. \"As soon as your aunt comes I'll take Mr. Damon  home, and then I'll give the rest of my time to you.\"    And this Tom did, sending word home that he would remain at the  Nestor's all night and part of the next day.    Tom got but little sleep that night. He communicated with the police  and saw to it that a general alarm was sent out. He called up all  hospitals within a radius of fifty miles, but could get no trace of any  injured man whose description resembled that of Mr. Nestor.    \"What can have happened?\" asked Mary tearfully.    \"Well, the way I figure it out is this,\" said Tom. \"Your father left my  house soon after Mr. Damon and I did in the Air Scout.  Mr. Nestor was  riding his bicycle, and he must have been run into by an automobile.  That is how his watch was damaged and that was when Mr. Damon and I  heard the cries for help.\"    \"Oh, do you think he was badly hurt?\" asked Mary.    \"No, I don't,\" and Tom answered truthfully. \"The voice sounded as  though he was in pain, certainly, but it was strong and vigorous, and  not at all as though he was dangerously hurt.\"    \"And what do you think happened to him after he was hurt?\" asked Mary.    \"The autoists took him away,\" decided Tom. \"In fact, we heard the  machine go, but of course we never connected the call for help and what  followed with your father. The autoists took him away.\"    \"Where?\"    \"I should say to some hospital. Perhaps a private one of which we know  nothing, and which may be near here. I'll get a full list from the  Board of Health to-morrow. Or it may be that the autoists, seeing the  damage they had done, took your father to the home of one of  themselves, and summoned a doctor there.\"    \"Why would they do that?\"    \"Well, they may have been so frightened they didn't realize what they  were doing, or they may have thought he would get better treatment in a  private house, if he were not badly injured, than if he should be taken  to a hospital. It may have been that one of the persons in the auto was  a physician, and wished to try his own skill on the man he had hurt.\"    \"You make me feel more comfortable, Tom,\" said Mary. \"But, even  supposing all this, why couldn't they telephone to us that my father  was all right? He always carries an identification card with him, and  if he were unconscious it could be ascertained who he was.\"    \"That's what I can't understand,\" said Tom frankly. \"It puzzles me. But  we'll find him--never fear!\"    And so he kept on with his telephone inquiries, while a physician and  her sister ministered to Mrs. Nestor. The night was very, very long,  and no good news came in.          CHAPTER XVII    SILENT SAM      Slowly the dawn broke through the mists of darkness, and made the earth  light. The sun came straggling in through cracks in the shutters in the  home of Mr. Nestor, the gradually increasing gleam paling the electric  lights, in the glare of which Tom Swift, Mary, and her aunt sat,  waiting for some word of the missing man. But none came.    \"What shall we do now?\" asked Mary, as she looked at Tom.    \"Oh, there's lots to do,\" he said, trying to make his voice sound  cheerful. \"We'll be busy all day. I sent word to have one of my touring  cars ready to hurry to any part of the country the moment we should get  word from your father.\"    \"And do you think we shall get word, Tom?\" the girl went on wistfully.    \"Of course we shall!\" he cried. \"Word may come in at any time.  Now get  ready, eat a good breakfast, and then you can go with me as soon as we  hear anything definite. Come, we'll have breakfast!\"    \"I can't eat a thing!\" protested Mary.    \"Oh, yes you can,\" said her aunt, who was a cheerful sort of person.  \"I'll see about getting something for you and Mr. Swift, and see that  your mother is all right.\"    She left the room to give orders to the servant about the meal, and  returned to say that Mrs. Nestor was sleeping quietly. She had been  given a sedative. Mary managed to eat a little, and she gave Tom the  address of several friends who were called up in the vain hope that,  somehow, Mr. Nestor might have gone to see them.    \"Tom, what do you really think has happened?\" asked Mary again, as they  sat facing one another in the library, during a respite from the  telephone.    Tom Swift repeated, to the girl his theory of what had happened with an  assumption of confidence he did not altogether feel.    His prediction of a speedy end to the suspense did not come true that  day, nor for many days.

But I know there is not any such here.' To those whose hearts  failed them he offered the _Marigold_. 'But let them go homeward; for  if I find them in my way, I will surely sink them.' Not a man stepped  forward. Then, turning to the officers, he discharged every one of them  for re-appointment at his pleasure. Next, he made the worst offenders,  the 'craftie lawyer' included, step to the front for reprimand. Finally,  producing the Queen's commission, he ended by a ringing appeal to their  united patriotism. 'We have set by the ears three mighty Princes [the  sovereigns of England, Spain, and Portugal]; and if this voyage should  not have success we should not only be a scorning unto our enemies but a  blot on our country for ever. What triumph would it not be for Spain and  Portugal! The like of this would never more be tried.' Then he gave back  every man his rank again, explaining that he and they were all servants  of Her Majesty together. With this the men marched off, loyal and  obedient, to their tents.    Next week Drake sailed for the much dreaded Straits, before entering  which he changed the _Pelican's_ name to the _Golden Hind_, which was  the crest of Sir Christopher Hatton, one of the chief promoters of the  enterprise and also one of Doughty's patrons. Then every vessel struck  her topsail to the bunt in honor of the Queen as well as to show that  all discoveries and captures were to be made in her sole name. Seventeen  days of appalling dangers saw them through the Straits, where icy  squalls came rushing down from every quarter of the baffling channels.  But the Pacific was still worse. For no less than fifty-two consecutive  days a furious gale kept driving them about like so many bits of  driftwood. 'The like of it no traveller hath felt, neither hath there  ever been such a tempest since Noah's flood.' The little English vessels  fought for their very lives in that devouring hell of waters, the  loneliest and most stupendous in the world. The _Marigold_ went down  with all hands, and Parson Fletcher, who heard their dying call, thought  it was a judgment. At last the gale abated near Cape Horn, where Drake  landed with a compass, while Parson Fletcher set up a stone engraved  with the Queen's name and the date of the discovery.    Deceived by the false trend of the coast shown on the Spanish charts  Drake went a long way northwest from Cape Horn. Then he struck in  northeast and picked up the Chilean Islands. It was December, 1578; but  not a word of warning had reached the Spanish Pacific when Drake stood  in to Valparaiso. Seeing a sail, the crew of the _Grand Captain of the  South_ got up a cask of wine and beat a welcome on their drums. In the  twinkling of an eye gigantic Tom Moone was over the side at the head of  a party of boarders who laid about them with a will and soon drove the  Spaniards below. Half a million dollars' worth of gold and jewels was  taken with this prize.    Drake then found a place in Salado Bay where he could clean the _Golden  Hind_ while the pinnace ranged south to look for the other ships that  had parted company during the two months' storm. These were never found,  the _Elizabeth_ and the _Swan_ having gone home after parting company in  the storm that sank the _Marigold_. After a prolonged search the _Golden  Hind_ stood north again. Meanwhile the astounding news of her arrival  was spreading dismay all over the coast, where the old Spanish  governor's plans were totally upset. The Indians had just been defeated  when this strange ship came sailing in from nowhere, to the utter  confusion of their enemies. The governor died of vexation, and all the  Spanish authorities were nearly worried to death. They had never dreamt  of such an invasion. Their crews were small, their lumbering vessels  very lightly armed, their towns unfortified.    But Drake went faster by sea than their news by land. Every vessel was  overhauled, taken, searched, emptied of its treasure, and then sent back  with its crew and passengers at liberty. One day a watering party  chanced upon a Spaniard from Potosi fast asleep with thirteen bars of  silver by him. The bars were lifted quietly and the Spaniard left  sleeping peacefully. Another Spaniard suddenly came round a corner with  half a ton of silver on eight llamas. The Indians came off to trade; and  Drake, as usual, made friends with them at once. He had already been  attacked by other Indians on both coasts. But this was because the  unknown English had been mistaken for the hated Spaniards.    As he neared Lima, Drake quickened his pace lest the great annual  treasure ship of 1579 should get wind of what was wrong. A minor  treasure ship was found to have been cleared of all her silver just in  time to balk him. So he set every stitch of canvas she possessed and  left her driving out to sea with two other empty prizes. Then he stole  into Lima after dark and came to anchor surrounded by Spanish vessels  not one of which had set a watch. They were found nearly empty. But a  ship from Panama looked promising; so the pinnace started after her, but  was fired on and an Englishman was killed. Drake then followed her,  after cutting every cable in the harbor, which soon became a pandemonium  of vessels gone adrift. The Panama ship had nothing of great value  except her news, which was that the great treasure ship _Nuestra Senora  de la Concepcion_, 'the chiefest glory of the whole South Sea,' was on  her way to Panama.    She had a very long start; and, as ill luck would have it, Drake got  becalmed outside Callao, where the bells rang out in wild alarm. The  news had spread inland and the Viceroy of Peru came hurrying down with  all the troops that he could muster. Finding from some arrows that the  strangers were Englishmen, he put four hundred soldiers into the only  two vessels that had escaped the general wreck produced by Drake's  cutting of the cables. When Drake saw the two pursuing craft, he took  back his prize crew from the Panama vessel, into which he put his  prisoners. Meanwhile a breeze sprang up and he soon drew far ahead. The  Spanish soldiers overhauled the Panama prize and gladly gave up the  pursuit. They had no guns of any size with which to; fight the _Golden  Hind_, and most of them were so sea-sick from the heaving ground-swell  that they couldn't have boarded her in any case.    Three more prizes were then taken by the swift _Golden Hind_. Each one  had news which showed that Drake was closing on the chase. Another week  passed with every stitch of canvas set. A fourth prize, taken off Cape  San Francisco, said that the treasure ship was only one day ahead. But  she was getting near to Panama; so every nerve was strained anew.  Presently Jack Drake, the Captain's page, yelled out _Sail-ho!_ and  scrambled down the mainmast to get the golden chain that Drake had  promised to the first lookout who saw the chase. It was ticklish work,  so near to Panama; and local winds might ruin all. So Drake, in order  not to frighten her, trailed a dozen big empty wine jars over the stern  to moderate his pace. At eight o'clock the jars were cut adrift and the  _Golden Hind_ sprang forward with the evening breeze, her crew at battle  quarters and her decks all cleared for action The chase was called the  'Spitfire' by the Spaniards because she was much better armed than any  other vessel there. But, all the same, her armament was nothing for her  tonnage. The Spaniards trusted to their remoteness for protection; and  that was their undoing.    To every Englishman's amazement the chase was seen to go about and  calmly come to hail the _Golden Hind_, which she mistook for a despatch  vessel sent after her with some message from the Viceroy! Drake, asking  nothing better, ran up alongside as Anton her captain hailed him with a  _Who are you? A ship of Chili!_ answered Drake. Anton looked down on the  stranger's deck to see it full of armed men from whom a roar of triumph  came. _English! strike sail!_ Then Drake's whistle blew sharply and  instant silence followed; on which he hailed Don Anton:--_Strike sail!  Senor Juan de Anton, or I must send you to the bottom!--Come aboard and  do it yourself!_ bravely answered Anton. Drake's whistle blew one shrill  long blast, which loosed a withering volley at less than point-blank  range. Anton tried to bear away and shake off his assailant. But in  vain. The English guns now opened on his masts and rigging. Down came  the mizzen, while a hail of English shot and arrows prevented every  attempt to clear away the wreckage. The dumbfounded Spanish crew ran  below, Don Anton looked overside to port; and there was the English  pinnace, from which forty English boarders were nimbly climbing up his  own ship's side. Resistance was hopeless; so Anton struck and was taken  aboard the _Golden Hind_. There he met Drake, who was already taking off  his armor. 'Accept with patience the usage of war,' said Drake, laying  his hand on Anton's shoulder.    For all that night, next day, and the next night following Drake sailed  west with his fabulous prize so as to get well clear of the trade route  along the coast. What the whole treasure was has never been revealed.  But it certainly amounted to the equivalent of many millions at the  present day. Among the official items were: 13 chests of pieces of  eight, 80 lbs. of pure gold, jewels and plate, 26 ton weight of silver,  and sundries unspecified. As the Spanish pilot's son looked over the  rail at this astounding sight, the Englishmen called out to say that his  father was no longer the pilot of the old Spit-_fire_ but of the new  Spit-_silver_.    The prisoners were no less gratified than surprised by Drake's kind  treatment. He entertained Don Anton at a banquet, took him all over the  _Golden Hind_, and entrusted him with a message to Don Martin, the  traitor of San Juan de Ulua. This was to say that if "]]]
