I send you herewith a    number of my verses that have appeared this week in my column.    Having done my work ahead I am rusticating in great shape and have    become a veritable terror to the small fry in which the lakes of    this delectable locality abound. My books will be issued about the    first of August; they will be very pretty pieces of work; I shall    send you a set at once. My western verse seems to be catching on; I    notice that a good many others of the boys are striking out in the    same vein. Young McCarthy has made a translation from the Persian,    and I have half a notion to paraphrase parts of it. I want to dip    around in all sorts of versification, simply to show people that    determination and perseverance can accomplish much in this    direction. You know that I do not set much store by \"genius.\"    The books to which Field refers as likely to be issued about the first  of August were his two \"Little Books\" of verse and tales, the copy for  which had not, when he wrote the foregoing, all gone to the printer.  His idea then was that a book could be got out with something like the  same lightning dispatch as a daily newspaper.    To tell the story of the publication of Field's two \"Little Books,\"  unique as it was in the making of books, requires that I say a few  words of the change that had come over our personal relations, though  not in our friendship. Two causes operated to make this change--my  marriage in the spring of 1887, which drew from Field \"Ye Piteous  Appeal of a Forsooken Habbit\" and the manuscript volumes of the best  of his verse prior to that event, and my retirement from the staff of  the Daily News, to assist in the foundation of the weekly political  and literary journal called America. It was through my persuasion that  we secured from Field his now famous \"Little Boy Blue\" for the initial  number of the new periodical. Many stories are extant as to how this  affecting bit of child verse was written, and many fac-similes of  copies of it in Field's handwriting have been printed as originals.  But the truth is, \"Little Boy Blue\" was written without any special  suggestion or personal experience attending its conception and  composition. It was an honest child, begotten of the freest and best  genius of Field's fancy--the genius of a master craftsman who had the  instinct to use only the simplest means to tell the significant story  of the little toy dog that is covered with dust and the little toy  soldier that is red with rust in so many a home.    Field handed his original copy of \"Little Boy Blue\" to me in the Daily  News office. We read it over carefully together, and there I, with his  consent, made the change in the seventh line of the last verse, that  may be noted in the fac-simile. With my interlineation the copy went  to the printer, who had orders to return it to me, which was  accordingly done, and it has been in my possession ever since.    Field made several other noteworthy contributions to the pages of  America, including such important verse or articles as \"Apple Pie and  Cheese,\" \"To Robin Goodfellow,\" \"A Proper Trewe Idyll of Camelot,\"  \"The Shadwell Folio,\" \"Poe, Patterson, and Oquawka,\" \"The Holy Cross,\"  and \"The Three Kings.\" The most remarkable of these was undoubtedly  \"The Shadwell Folio,\" which ran through two issues of America and  afforded a prose setting for the following proofs of Field's  versatility: \"The Death of Robin Hood,\" \"The Alliaunce,\" \"Madge: Ye  Hoyden,\" \"The Lost Schooner,\" \"Ye Crewel Sassinger Mill,\" \"The Texas  Steere,\" \"A Vallentine,\" \"Waly, Waly,\" \"Ailsie, My Bairn,\" \"Ye Morris  Daunce,\" \"Ye Battaile Aux Dames,\" \"How Trewe Love Won Ye Battel,\"  \"Lollaby\" (old English).    The first section of the \"Shadwell Folio\" appeared in the issue of  America of October 25th, 1888. It was one of those conceits in which  Field took the greatest pleasure and in the preparation of which he  grudged no labor. It purported to be a parchment folio discovered in  an old hair trunk by Colonel John C. Shadwell, \"a wealthy and  aristocratic contractor,\" while laying certain main and sewer pipes in  the cellar of a deserted frame house at 1423 Michigan Street, Chicago.  This number would have located the cellar well out in Lake Michigan.  Colonel Shadwell presented this incomparable folio to \"The Ballad and  Broadside Society of Cook County, Illinois, for the Discovery of  Ancient Manuscripts and for the Dissemination of Culture (limited).\"  On receipt of the folio, this society immediately adopted the  following resolutions:      _Resolved_, That the ballads set forth in the parchment manuscript,    known as the Shadwell folio, are genuine old English ballads,    composed by English balladists, and illustrating most correctly life    in Chicago in Ancient Times, which is to say, before the fire.      _Resolved_, That the parchment cover of said folio is, in our    opinion, neither pigskin nor sheep, but genuine calf, and    undoubtedly the pelt of the original fatted calf celebrated in    Shakespeare's play of the \"Prodigal Son.\"      _Resolved_, That we hail with pride these indisputable proofs that    our refinement and culture had an ancestry, and that our present    civilization did not spring, as ribald scoffers have alleged,    mushroom-like from the sties and wallows of the prairies.      _Resolved_, That we get these ballads printed in an edition of not    to exceed 500 copies, and at a cost of $50 per copy, or, at least,    at a price beyond the capability of the hoy polloi.    Field then proceeded to review the contents of the fictitious folio,  taking the precaution to premise his remarks and extracts with the  statement that \"it must not be surmised that all the poems in this  Shadwell folio are purely local; quite a number treat of historical  subjects.\" Of the poems in the first half of \"The Shadwell Folio\" I am  able to give one of the most interesting in fac-simile, premising  that, although this did not see the light of print until October,  1888, it was written in an early month of 1887.    On pages 19 and 20 of the folio, according to Field, we get a  \"pleasant glimpse of the rare old time\" in the ballad entitled:    [Illustration: \"THE ALLIAUNCE\".      Come hither, gossip, let us sit        beneath this plaisaunt vine;    I fain wolde counsel thee a bit        whiles that we sip our wine.

He is ready to smash the whole  universe for the sake of itself.         I put these things not in their mature logical sequence, but as  they came:  and this view was cleared and sharpened by an accident  of the time.  Under the lengthening shadow of Ibsen, an argument  arose whether it was not a very nice thing to murder one's self.  Grave moderns told us that we must not even say \"poor fellow,\"  of a man who had blown his brains out, since he was an enviable person,  and had only blown them out because of their exceptional excellence.  Mr. William Archer even suggested that in the golden age there  would be penny-in-the-slot machines, by which a man could kill  himself for a penny.  In all this I found myself utterly hostile  to many who called themselves liberal and humane.  Not only is  suicide a sin, it is the sin.  It is the ultimate and absolute evil,  the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take  the oath of loyalty to life.  The man who kills a man, kills a man.  The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned  he wipes out the world.  His act is worse (symbolically considered)  than any rape or dynamite outrage.  For it destroys all buildings:  it insults all women.  The thief is satisfied with diamonds;  but the suicide is not:  that is his crime.  He cannot be bribed,  even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City.  The thief  compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them.  But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it.  He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake.  There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death  is not a sneer.  When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves  might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury:  for each has received a personal affront.  Of course there may be  pathetic emotional excuses for the act.  There often are for rape,  and there almost always are for dynamite.  But if it comes to clear  ideas and the intelligent meaning of things, then there is much  more rational and philosophic truth in the burial at the cross-roads  and the stake driven through the body, than in Mr. Archer's suicidal  automatic machines.  There is a meaning in burying the suicide apart.  The man's crime is different from other crimes--for it makes even  crimes impossible.         About the same time I read a solemn flippancy by some free thinker:  he said that a suicide was only the same as a martyr.  The open  fallacy of this helped to clear the question.  Obviously a suicide  is the opposite of a martyr.  A martyr is a man who cares so much  for something outside him, that he forgets his own personal life.  A suicide is a man who cares so little for anything outside him,  that he wants to see the last of everything.  One wants something  to begin:  the other wants everything to end.  In other words,  the martyr is noble, exactly because (however he renounces the world  or execrates all humanity) he confesses this ultimate link with life;  he sets his heart outside himself:  he dies that something may live.  The suicide is ignoble because he has not this link with being:  he is a mere destroyer; spiritually, he destroys the universe.  And then I remembered the stake and the cross-roads, and the queer  fact that Christianity had shown this weird harshness to the suicide.  For Christianity had shown a wild encouragement of the martyr.  Historic Christianity was accused, not entirely without reason,  of carrying martyrdom and asceticism to a point, desolate  and pessimistic.  The early Christian martyrs talked of death  with a horrible happiness.  They blasphemed the beautiful duties  of the body:  they smelt the grave afar off like a field of flowers.  All this has seemed to many the very poetry of pessimism.  Yet there  is the stake at the crossroads to show what Christianity thought of  the pessimist.         This was the first of the long train of enigmas with which  Christianity entered the discussion.  And there went with it a  peculiarity of which I shall have to speak more markedly, as a note  of all Christian notions, but which distinctly began in this one.  The Christian attitude to the martyr and the suicide was not what is  so often affirmed in modern morals.  It was not a matter of degree.  It was not that a line must be drawn somewhere, and that the  self-slayer in exaltation fell within the line, the self-slayer  in sadness just beyond it.  The Christian feeling evidently  was not merely that the suicide was carrying martyrdom too far.  The Christian feeling was furiously for one and furiously against  the other:  these two things that looked so much alike were at  opposite ends of heaven and hell.  One man flung away his life;  he was so good that his dry bones could heal cities in pestilence.  Another man flung away life; he was so bad that his bones would  pollute his brethren's. I am not saying this fierceness was right;  but why was it so fierce?         Here it was that I first found that my wandering feet were  in some beaten track.  Christianity had also felt this opposition  of the martyr to the suicide:  had it perhaps felt it for the  same reason?  Had Christianity felt what I felt, but could not  (and cannot) express--this need for a first loyalty to things,  and then for a ruinous reform of things?  Then I remembered  that it was actually the charge against Christianity that it  combined these two things which I was wildly trying to combine.  Christianity was accused, at one and the same time, of being  too optimistic about the universe and of being too pessimistic  about the world.  The coincidence made me suddenly stand still.         An imbecile habit has arisen in modern controversy of saying  that such and such a creed can be held in one age but cannot  be held in another.  Some dogma, we are told, was credible  in the twelfth century, but is not credible in the twentieth.  You might as well say that a certain philosophy can be believed  on Mondays, but cannot be believed on Tuesdays.  You might as well  say of a view of the cosmos that it was suitable to half-past three,  but not suitable to half-past four.  What a man can believe  depends upon his philosophy, not upon the clock or the century.  If a man believes in unalterable natural law, he cannot believe  in any miracle in any age.  If a man believes in a will behind law,  he can believe in any miracle in any age.  Suppose, for the sake  of argument, we are concerned with a case of thaumaturgic healing.  A materialist of the twelfth century could not believe it any more  than a materialist of the twentieth century.  But a Christian  Scientist of the twentieth century can believe it as much as a  Christian of the twelfth century.  It is simply a matter of a man's  theory of things.  Therefore in dealing with any historical answer,  the point is not whether it was given in our time, but whether it  was given in answer to our question.  And the more I thought about  when and how Christianity had come into the world, the more I felt  that it had actually come to answer this question.         It is commonly the loose and latitudinarian Christians who pay  quite indefensible compliments to Christianity.  They talk as if  there had never been any piety or pity until Christianity came,  a point on which any mediaeval would have been eager to correct them.  They represent that the remarkable thing about Christianity was that it  was the first to preach simplicity or self-restraint, or inwardness  and sincerity.  They will think me very narrow (whatever that means)  if I say that the remarkable thing about Christianity was that it  was the first to preach Christianity.  Its peculiarity was that it  was peculiar, and simplicity and sincerity are not peculiar,  but obvious ideals for all mankind.  Christianity was the answer  to a riddle, not the last truism uttered after a long talk.  Only the other day I saw in an excellent weekly paper of Puritan tone  this remark, that Christianity when stripped of its armour of dogma  (as who should speak of a man stripped of his armour of bones),  turned out to be nothing but the Quaker doctrine of the Inner Light.  Now, if I were to say that Christianity came into the world  specially to destroy the doctrine of the Inner Light, that would  be an exaggeration.  But it would be very much nearer to the truth.  The last Stoics, like Marcus Aurelius, were exactly the people  who did believe in the Inner Light.  Their dignity, their weariness,  their sad external care for others, their incurable internal care  for themselves, were all due to the Inner Light, and existed only  by that dismal illumination.  Notice that Marcus Aurelius insists,  as such introspective moralists always do, upon small things done  or undone; it is because he has not hate or love enough to make  a moral revolution.  He gets up early in the morning, just as our  own aristocrats living the Simple Life get up early in the morning;  because such altruism is much easier than stopping the games  of the amphitheatre or giving the English people back their land.  Marcus Aurelius is the most intolerable of human types.  He is an  unselfish egoist.  An unselfish egoist is a man who has pride without  the excuse of passion.  Of all conceivable forms of enlightenment  the worst is what these people call the Inner Light.  Of all horrible  religions the most horrible is the worship of the god within.  Any one who knows any body knows how it would work; any one who knows  any one from the Higher Thought Centre knows how it does work.  That Jones shall worship the god within him turns out ultimately  to mean that Jones shall worship Jones.  Let Jones worship the sun  or moon, anything rather than the Inner Light; let Jones worship  cats or crocodiles, if he can find any in his street, but not  the god within.  Christianity came into the world firstly in order  to"]]]
