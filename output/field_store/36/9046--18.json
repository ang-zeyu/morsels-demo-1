We landed at  half flood, without difficulty; and on ascending the hill, obtained a  view of the Sound which exceeded my expectations. Amongst the many  bearings taken, were the following fixed points in the survey.      Pine Mount, of Shoal-water Bay,     S. 84 deg. 38' E.  Pier Head, the western part,        N. 36   7  E.  West hill, the top,                 N. 28   5  W.  Flat Isles, the 4th, station there, N. 39  53  W.      The breadth of the Sound, from Upper Head over to the inner end of Long  Island, appeared to be three leagues, but it contracted upwards, and  assumed the same river-like form as Shoalwater Bay; and it was to be  feared, from the mangrove shores and muddiness of the water, that it  would terminate in the same manner. No shoals could be then  distinguished; but towards low water in the evening I again ascended the  hill, and saw to my regret, that the upper parts were mostly occupied  with banks of mud and sand, many of which were dry, and extended downward  past the inner entrance of Thirsty Sound. Amongst the banks were various  channels; but that of about two miles wide where the ship lay, was by far  the most considerable. The small fifth opening, close on the west side of  Upper Head, ran some miles in the low land towards the foot of a ridge of  hills, lying three or four leagues at the back of the shore; but the  greater part of this inlet was also taken up by mud banks, and the  borders covered with mangroves. There was no fresh water at Upper Head,  nor did I see any prospect of obtaining wherewith to complete the holds  of the two vessels before leaving the coast; unless it were at a place a  little higher up on the same side, to which the appearance of another  opening between two hills, induced me to move the ship.    MONDAY 13 SEPTEMBER 1802    Next morning, when the flood made, we drifted upwards, with the Lady  Nelson and a boat sounding ahead. After advancing three miles the brig  suddenly took the ground, and we dropped a stream anchor; but in swinging  to it, the ship was caught upon a bank of quick sand in eleven feet; and  the tide running strong upon the broad side, it made her heel in a manner  to excite alarm. The sails were immediately clewed down, and the  top-gallant yards struck; and it appearing that the stream anchor allowed  the ship to drive further up the bank as the tide rose, the best bower  was let go, and then she righted and swung to the tide. The Lady Nelson  also got off safe; but a part of the after sliding keel was carried away.    I went in a boat to examine the place which had presented the appearance  of an opening; but it proved to be only a bending in the shore, and the  mud banks and mangroves did not admit of landing; we therefore went back  with the returning ebb to Upper Head, and moored the ship nearly in our  first situation; where there was something more than 3 fathoms all round,  at low water.    TUESDAY 14 SEPTEMBER 1802    On the following morning, the time keepers and other instruments were  sent on shore under the charge of lieutenant Flinders, with two of the  young gentlemen to assist him, and a guard of marines for the protection  of the tents. It had appeared from the survey, that the time keepers were  losing more than the Port-Jackson rates supposed; and before quitting  this coast for the Gulph of Carpentaria, it was necessary to take fresh  observations. Mr. Flinders undertook as usual to perform this service,  whilst I should be absent up the Sound; and lieutenant Fowler was  directed to examine and air all the stores, and make the ship ready for  sea against my return.    Having made these dispositions, I embarked in the Lady Nelson with the  naturalist, taking my whale boat and surveying instruments. We had a  strong flood tide; and after grounding on a bank, anchored eleven miles  above the ship, in 3 fathoms, that being the greatest depth to be found.  It was then high water; and the brig being expected to be left dry by the  ebb, we prepared for it by mooring, to prevent all chance of settling on  the anchor, and hove up the fore and after keels; the new main keel being  swelled by the wet, could not be raised, and when it took the ground, the  vessel turned about violently and dragged both the anchors, until the  keel broke off, and then she lay easy.    At low water, the seamen went out upon the dry flat and found the best  bower cable parted, and the anchor so far buried in the quicksand, that  it could not be raised. At ten o'clock the flood tide came rolling in,  and presently set the brig afloat; the anchor was then weighed with ease,  by means of a hawser previously bent to it, and the vessel rode by the  small bower, against a tide which ran at the strongest between four and  five knots.    WEDNESDAY 15 SEPTEMBER 1802    The Lady Nelson again took the ground at six in the morning. On sounding  over to the east shore, distant half a mile, I found a small channel  leading upwards, with four or five feet more water in it than where the  brig lay; the western shore was two miles distant over a silty flat,  which was dry at low water and level as a race ground.    At eleven, the flood came in, six or eight inches perpendicular, with a  roaring noise; and so soon as it had passed the brig, I set off with Mr.  Brown and Mr. Lacy in the whale boat, to follow it up the small channel  on the eastern shore; and having a fair wind we outran the tide and were  sometimes obliged to wait its rising before we could proceed. At the end  of six miles the small channel led across to the western side; and the  rare opportunity of a landing place induced me to pitch our tent there  for the night: two miles higher up, the whole breadth of the Sound was  reduced to half a mile.    The country here was a stiff, clayey flat, covered with grass, and seemed  to have been overflowed at spring tides; though the high water of this  day did not reach it by five feet. Three or four miles to the southward  there were some hills, whence I hoped to see the course of the stream up  to its termination; and having time before dark, we set off. The grass of  the plain was interspersed with a species of sensitive plant, whose  leaves curled up in, and about our footsteps in such a manner, that the  way we had come was for some time distinguishable. From the nearest of  the small hills, I set the bearings of Double and Pine Mounts, our tent,  and the brig at anchor, by which this station was fixed as in the chart;  but in order to reconcile the bearings, I found it necessary to allow 12 deg.  of east variation.    Towards Double Mount and Shoal-water Bay, the country consisted of  gently-rising hills and extensive plains, well covered with wood and  apparently fertile. The stream at the head of Broad Sound could not be  traced from hence more than three or four miles above the tent; but it  may possibly run up much further to the south-eastward, though too small  to be distinguished in the wood, or to be navigable for boats. To the  south and westward there was a ridge of high land, which appeared to be a  prolongation of the same whence the upper branches of Port Bowen and  Shoal-water Bay take their rise, and by which the low land and small arms  on the west side of Broad Sound are bounded. A similar ridge ran behind  Port Curtis and Keppel Bay, and it is not improbable that the two are  connected, and of the same substance; for at Port Curtis the basis stone  of the country was a granite, and this small hill was the same. It has  been more than once observed, that granite is amongst the substances  which exert an influence upon the magnetic needle; and it is to the  attraction of the ridge of mountains to the south and westward, that I  attribute the great variation found in the bearings at this station.    We returned to the tent at sunset; and there passed a disagreeable night  amongst musketoes, sand flies, and ants. At four in the morning [THURSDAY  16 SEPTEMBER 1802] the ebb had made, and we embarked in the boat; but the  depth of water was so little that we could not proceed, and were obliged  to re-land and wait for the following tide; not without apprehension of  being left till the next springs came on. At two in the afternoon the  flood came up rapidly, and in half an hour it was high water; we set off  immediately, and after some trouble from the shoals, reached the brig at  five o'clock. Mr. Murray got under way at three the next morning [FRIDAY  17 SEPTEMBER 1802] to beat down to Upper Head, the wind being from the  northward; but the Lady Nelson getting aground, I went off with Mr. Brown  in my boat, and reached the ship at seven o'clock, and in the evening,  the brig arrived.    Lieutenant Fowler had gone through the most essential duties, and the  ship was nearly ready for sea; but on landing at the tents I found that  the time keepers had been let down, and the business of finding new rates  for them was to be recommenced. This accident would require a week to be  repaired; and being unwilling to remain so long inactive, I determined to  leave Mr. Flinders at Upper Head, and take the ship over to the inner end  of Thirsty Sound, where it appeared there was something to correct in  captain Cook's chart.    SATURDAY 18 SEPTEMBER 1802    The Lady Nelson had lost two sheets of copper, and the trunks of the  sliding keels required some reparation; I therefore desired lieutenant  Murray to lay his vessel on shore and get these matters arranged, to cut  wood for himself, and be ready to sail in a week for Torres' Strait; and  his stock of water was completed out of the Investigator.    SUNDAY 19 SEPTEMBER 1802    On the 19th in the morning we unmoored the ship, and a little before low  tide stretched over towards Thirsty Sound; but the numerous shoals to be  encountered, and which cannot be concisely described otherwise than in a  chart, caused much delay; and it was near noon of the day following  [MONDA"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13127"],[0,"Observations on the Mussulmauns of India (#16)"],[1,"now, where the enthusiastic Sheahs and Soonies--having  reserved their long hatred for a favourable opportunity of giving it  vent,[23]--have found an early grave on the very ground to which their  Tazia has been consigned. Private quarrels are often reserved for decision  on the field of Kraabaallah.    I may here remark, swords form a part of every man's daily costume, from  the king to the poorest peasant; save only the devout men, who having  forsaken the world have no occasion for a sword. I have often heard them  say, 'My trust is not resting on a morsel of steel, but on the great mercy  of my God'.--'What shall I defend? my life? Where is the arm that can  assault me without the permission of my God; if He ordains it, should I  murmur, or ward off the blow?'--'Is it my worldly goods I am to defend?  From whose bounty have I received them? Is not the great Giver able to  defend His gifts? and if He wills that I should lose them, what shall I  say, but as Yoube[24] (Job) said, \"It is the Lord, to do His own will\";  blessed be His great name for ever.' These are the sentiments of the  devout men of all creeds; and these are likewise the exemplary opinions of  some good Mussulmauns I have known in India.    Returned to their home, the rich men are occupied in dispensing benefits  among the poor. Food, money, and clothes, are distributed in nearly as  great proportions as when they have to mourn over a recent separation by  death from a beloved relative. The clothes worn during Mahurrum are never  retained for the next occasion, but always distributed amongst the poor,  who derive so many advantages from the annual commemoration of Mahurrum,  that the philanthropic heart will rather be pleased than vexed at the zeal  which produces such a harvest of benefits to the necessitous.    The riches of a native city may be calculated by the immense sums expended  at Mahurrum every year; and if no greater advantage be derived from the  gorgeous display of the wealthy, than the stimulus to honest industry  amongst the several trades, whose labour is brought into use on these  occasions, there is enough in the result to excuse the expenditure of  surplus cash in apparent trifles. This, however, is strictly the result,  not the design, of those expensive displayers at Mahurrum, who are  actuated solely by fervent zeal, in keeping a continued remembrance of the  sufferings of their Emaums, and doing honour to their memory.    It is not my province either to praise or condemn, but merely to mark out  what I observe of singularity in the habits, manners, and customs of the  Mussulmauns, in whose domestic circles I have been so many years a  sojourner. On the subject which my pen has faintly traced to your  view,--the celebration of Mahurrum,--I cannot refrain from offering one  remark; I think them to be actuated by so fervent a zeal, that if they  could believe with me, that whatever we do in this life is for Eternity,  they would still persevere in this their supposed duty of honouring their  Emaums.

In Oude the fish is represented in many useful      articles--pleasure boats, carriages, &c. Some of the King's Chobdhaars      carry a staff representing a gold or silver fish.

'He      differed from his father, Ghazi-ud-din Haidar, in being      considerably more debauched and disreputable. His father had been an      outwardly decent hedonist and voluptuary, but the son was under no      restraints of any sort or kind, and it is probable that his character      was not unfavourably depicted in that highly coloured sketch, \"The      Private Life of an Eastern King\" (by W. Knighton, 1855). \"Any one\", we      are told, \"was his friend who would drink with him,\" and his whole      reign was one continued satire upon the subsidiary and protected      system.'--H.C.

The person riding is sheltered from the rays of the      sun by the afthaadah being carried in an elevated position.      [_Author_.] (See p. 38.)    [12] _Chobdar_, 'a stick-or staff-bearer'.

[17] As early as A.D. 1000 the people of Baghdad used to throw dust and      ashes about the streets, and dress in black sackcloth on the      anniversary of the death of Husain (Ockley, _History of the Saracens_,      418). The custom was common among the Hebrews (Isaiah iii. 26, xlvii.      1; Job ii. 8, & c.). Robertson Smith suggests that the dust was      originally taken from the grave, and the ashes from the funeral pyre      (_Religion, of the Semites_, 413).

[20] The practice of offering food to the dead is an Indian innovation on      Musalman practice; it is based on the Hindu custom of offering      flour-balls (_pinda_) to the spirit of the dead man.    [21] This was a Hebrew practice, condemned by the prophets (2 Samuel      xv. 30; Ezekiel xxiv. 17).

[23] Ill-feeling between Sunnis and Shi'ahs is not universal in      India. 'Though the Sunnis consider the Shi'ah observances as      impious, they look on with the contempt of indifference. The fact that      the British Government punishes all who break the peace may have      something to do with this. Still the Sunni and the Shi'ah in      India live on much better terms, and have more respect for each other      than the Turk has for the Persian, or the Persian for the Turk. Some      Musalman poets, indeed, are both Sunnis and Shi'ahs.'--E.      Sell, _The Faith of Islam_, 292 f.; cf. p. 14.    [24] Aiyub.

In my last I alluded to the 'third watch'; it will now, perhaps, be  necessary to explain the divisions of time, as observed by the Mussulmauns  of Hindoostaun.    The day is divided into four equal parts, or watches, denominated  purrhs[1]; as, first purrh, second purrh, &c. The night is also divided  into four purrhs, each of which is subdivided into ghurries[2] (hours),  varying in number with the changes of season; the longest days require  eight ghurries to one purrh; the shortest, only six. The same division is  observed for the night. The day is reckoned from the earliest dawn to the  last decline of light:--there is very little twilight in the Upper  Provinces of India.
