This insures  perfect combustion of the gas within the basket of magnesia placed  above, and which is thus brought to a state of incandescence. It will  be seen from this description how simple and practical the  arrangement is. It is claimed for the light produced that it will  stand comparison with the electric light. Like that, it shows colors  perfectly true, and will enable an observer to distinguish between the  most delicate shades, allowing of the finest work being executed as by  daylight. It is, moreover, stated to be perfectly steady. As the  Clamond burner can be fixed to any gas bracket or lamp now in use, its  adoption causes no other expense than the cost of the burner itself.  There is no expensive installation, and when used in combination with  the electric light, it is claimed that a uniform lighting will be  obtainable instead of the unpleasant contrast between gas and  electricity. Another important advantage obtained by the Clamond  burner is the saving effected in the consumption of gas as compared  with the same power of light obtained from ordinary burners.           *       *       *       *       *          A NEW THERMO-REGULATOR.      In the thermo-regulators which have been constructed heretofore, the  heat has been regulated by the variation in the inflow of gas to the  heating flame. The apparatus described below, and shown in the  accompanying cut, taken from the _Zeitschrift fur Instrumentenkunde_,  operates on an entirely different principle. The distillation and  condensation process of a fluid heated to the boiling point in the  vessel, A, is as follows:    [Illustration]    The steam passes first through the pipes, _a_ and _c_, into the  serpentine tube, where it is condensed, and then flows through the  tubes, _d_ and _b_, back into the vessel, A, if the cock, _r_, is  closed, but if the said cock is open, it flows into the receptacle, K.  When the liquid begins to boil the steam passes freely through the  tubes, _d_ and _b_, part passing through the tube, _f_, out into the  air, and the other part passing through the open cock, _r_, to the  receptacle, K; but the condensed liquid soon closes these passages to  the steam. At _h_ is an opening for a thermometer, _t_, and through  this opening the liquid can be poured into the vessel, A. If the cock,  _r_, is kept closed, the volume of liquid in the vessel, A, cannot be  diminished, and the bath, B, must take the constant and uniform  temperature of the steam in the vessel, A, as the vessel, B, is heated  evenly on all sides.    This apparatus can also be used as an air bath, in which case the  vessel, B, is left empty and closed by a suitable stopper.           *       *       *       *       *          PIPETTE FOR TAKING THE DENSITY OF LIQUIDS.      The accompanying engraving represents a simple apparatus, which any  person accustomed to working glass can make for himself, and which  permits of quickly, and with close approximation, estimating the  density of a liquid. In addition, it has the advantage of requiring  but a very small quantity of the liquid.    It consists simply of a straight pipette, A B, to which is affixed  laterally, at the upper part, a small U-shaped water gauge.    The two branches of the gauge, as well as the pipette itself, are  graduated into equal divisions. If need be, the graduating may be done  by simply pasting on the glass strips of paper, upon which a graduated  scale has been drawn. The zero of the pipette's graduation is exactly  at the lower extremity, B. The graduation of the two gauge tubes  extends in both directions from a zero situated near the center. The  zeros of the two branches must correspond as exactly as possible, so  that they shall be in the same horizontal plane when the apparatus is  fixed upon a support. To render the apparatus complete, it only  remains to adapt, at A, a rubber tube provided with a wire clamp, and  terminating in a short glass tube for sucking through with the mouth.    [Illustration: PIPETTE FOR TAKING THE DENSITY OF LIQUIDS.]    For taking the density of a liquid, we plunge the end, B, into it, and  then suck, and afterward close the rubber tube with the clamp. It is  essential that this latter shall hold well, so that the levels may  remain constant.    We now do the reading. Suppose, for example, we read 250.3 mm. on the  pipette, and 147.7 mm. and 152 mm. on the branches of the gauge.  Having these data, we loosen the clamp, and allow the liquid to flow.  On account of capillarity, there remains a drop in B; and of this we  read the height, say 6 mm. A height 250.5 mm - 6 = 244.5 mm. of liquid  raised is, then, balanced by a column of water of 147.5 + 152 = 299  mm.    Now the heights of these two liquids is in the inverse ratio of their  densities:      _d_   299.5    --- = -----, whence _d_ = 1.22.     1    244.5    We obtain _d_ by a simple division.    When the instrument has been carefully graduated, and has been  constructed by an expert, the accuracy of the first two decimals may  be relied upon. With a little practice in estimating the last drop, we  may, in trying to estimate the density of water, even reach a closer  approximation. In order to measure the height of the drop accurately,  one should read the maximum height to which the liquid rises between  the fall of two drops at the moment when the last ones are falling,  since at that moment, and only at that, can it be ascertained that the  lower level of the bubble is plane. The error in such reading does not  reach half a millimeter, and, as a suitable height of the apparatus  permits of having columns that vary between 13 and 30 centimeters, an  error of this kind is but 1-300. This is the limit of precision of the  method.    The clamp might be advantageously replaced by a glass cock, or, better  still, A might terminate in a rubber bulb; and a lateral tubulure  might be fixed to the pipette, and be closed with a rubber stopper.    This little apparatus is more easily maneuvered than any of those that  have hitherto been devised upon the same principle. It is capable also  of replacing areometers in ordinary determinations, since it permits  of correcting the error in capillarity that is neglected in  instruments; and, moreover, one can, when he desires to, easily verify  for himself the accuracy of the graduation.--_La Nature._           *       *       *       *       *          USEFUL BAGS, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM.    By JOHN T. HUMPHREY.      Since the papers on \"Boot and Shoemaking,\" in vol. i. of _Amateur  Work_, illustrated, I think nothing relating to the leather trades has  appeared in it; and as there must be many among the readers of this  magazine who have a desire to dive deeper into the art of manipulating  leather into the various articles of utility made from that material,  I will endeavor in the series of articles of which this is the  commencement to furnish them with the necessary instructions which  will enable them to do for themselves many things which now are left  undone, or else have to be conveyed miles to some town where the  particular business, or something akin to it, is carried on. To the  colonist and those who live in out-of-the-way districts, it must be a  matter of great regret to observe articles of use, where the material  is in good condition, rapidly becoming useless owing to the inability  of the possessor to do the necessary repairs. Again, it may be that  the article is completely worn out, and the old proverb that \"a stitch  in time saves nine,\" will not be advantageously applied if carried  out. In that case a knowledge of making new what we require, whether  in order to replace something already worn out or as an addition to  our store, must prove beneficial to the thrifty amateur. My object in  writing these articles is not to deprive the mechanic of any portion  of his legitimate occupation, but to assist those who live at a  distance too great to be able to employ him, and who necessarily  prefer any makeshift to the inconvenience of sending miles, and being  without for days, an article which might possibly be set right in an  hour or two.      HOW TO MAKE BAGS.    The old-fashioned carpet bag (Fig. 1) is still unsurpassed by any,  where rough wear is the principal thing to be studied. Such a bag, if  constructed of good Brussels carpeting and unquestionable workmanship,  will last a lifetime, provided always that a substantial frame is  used.    [Illustration: FIG 1.--THE CARPET BAG.]    Next in order comes the brief bag (Fig. 2), more extensively used than  any other. For business purposes it is in great favor with bag users,  being made in a variety of shapes, but all belonging to the same  class. Here we have the shallow brief, deep brief, eclipse wide mouth,  imperial wide mouth, excelsior, courier, and many others; but to know  how to make one will be sufficient for all, the only difference being  in the cut or style in which they are constructed.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE BRIEF BAG.]    The cricket bat bag (represented in Fig. 3) is made on the same  principle throughout as the carpet bag.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE CRICKET BAT BAG.]    Frames and all necessary fittings required in making bags may be  purchased of dealers.    Care must be observed in choosing all the pieces necessary for a bag  from the same pattern carpet, otherwise it will present an unsightly  appearance when completed. There may be some who would prefer American  cloth; this is thoroughly waterproof, and has a good appearance for  some time, but, like all articles of imitation, it has only  _cheapness_ to recommend it. If cloth is to be used (I mean American  cloth), let it be the best that can be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16363"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol 1, Issue 4, January (#16)"],[1,"carrying field-gun and howitzer ammunition, which now has  been found a total wreck.    Along the road lie fourteen motor lorries, their iron skeletons twisted  and broken. Everything inflammable has been burned, as have the stripped  trees--some with split trunks--on either side of the road. Of the  drivers, nothing remains except tattered boots and charred scraps of  clothing, while the ground within a radius of fifty yards of the wagons  is littered with pieces of iron, split brass cartridge cases, which have  exploded, and some fixed-gun ammunition with live shells.    If it were possible to reconstruct this incident, if it was, in fact,  brought about as supposed, the grenade from the aeroplane must have  detonated on the leading lorry, on one side of the road, and caused the  cartridges carried by it to explode. Three vehicles immediately in the  rear must then have been set on fire, with a similar result. Behind  these are groups of four and two vehicles so jammed together as to  suggest that they must have collided in desperate attempts to stop. On  the other side of the road, almost level with the leading wagon, are  found more vehicles, which probably were fired by the explosion of the  first.    If this appalling destruction was due to one hand grenade, it is an  illustration of the potentialities of a small amount of high explosive  detonated in the right spot, while the nature of the place where the  disaster occurred, a narrow forest road between high trees, is a  testimony to the skill of the airmen.    It is only fair to add that some French newspapers claim this damage to  the enemy was caused by the action of a detachment of their dragoons.          IX.    *1,100 Dead in a Single Trench.*    [Official Summary, Dated Oct. 27.]      The Official Bureau makes public today the story of an eye-witness,  supplementing the account issued on Oct. 24, and bringing the story of  the general course of operations in France up to Oct. 20. The arrival of  reinforcements, it says, enabled the British troops to assist in the  extension of the Allies' line where the Germans advanced from the  northeast and east, holding a front extending from Mont Descats, about  ten miles northeast of Hazebrouck, through Meteren, five miles south of  that point, and thence to Estaires, thirteen miles west of Lille, on the  River Lys. The statement continues:    \"South of the Lys the German line extended to three miles east of  Bethune to Vermelles. The Allies encountered resistance all along the  line on the 12th and 13th, when the enemy's right fell back hastily.  Bailleul, seventeen miles northwest by west of Lille, which had been  occupied by the foe for eight days, was abandoned without a shot being  fired.    [Illustration: GEN. VON BUeLOW  Commanding One of the German Armies in the West  (_Copyright, Photographische Gesellschaft, by permission of the Berlin  Photographic Co., N.Y._)]    [Illustration: CROWN PRINCE RUPPRECHT OF BAVARIA  (_Copyright, Photographische Gesellschaft, by permission of the Berlin  Photographic Co., N.Y._)]    \"On the 14th our left wing advanced, driving the enemy back, and on the  night of the 15th we were in possession of all the country on the left  bank of the Lys to a point five miles below Armentieres. The enemy  retired from that town on the 16th, and the river line, to within a  short distance of Frelinghien, fell into our hands.    \"The state of the crossings over the Lys indicated that no organized  scheme of defense had been executed, some of the bridges being in a  state of repair, others merely barricaded, while one was not even  defended or broken.    \"The resistance offered to our advance on the 15th was of a most  determined character. The fighting consisted of fiercely contested  encounters, infantry attacks on the villages being unavailing until our  howitzers reduced the houses to ruins. Other villages were taken and  retaken three times before they were finally secured.    \"The French cavalry here gave welcome support, and on the evening of the  16th the resistance was overcome, the enemy retiring five miles to the  eastward.\"    Describing an incident of the fighting on this night, the narrative says  that the important crossing of the Lys at Warneton was strongly held by  the Germans with a barricade loopholed at the bottom to enable the men  to fire while lying down.    \"Our cavalry, with the artillery, blew the barricade to pieces and  scattered the defenders,\" the narrative continues. \"Advancing  three-quarters of a mile our troops reached the square, when one of the  buildings appeared to leap skyward. A sheet of flame and a shower of  star shells at the same time made the place as light as day and enabled  the enemy, ensconced in surrounding houses, to pour a devastating fire  from rifles and machine guns. Our cavalry extricated themselves with the  loss of one officer wounded and nine men killed and wounded, but a party  of volunteers went back and carried off their wounded comrades from the  inferno.    \"During the 17th, 18th, and 19th of October our right encountered strong  opposition from the enemy about La Bassee, where they had established  themselves behind embankments. On the centre and the left we made better  progress, although the Germans were everywhere intrenched, and, in spite  of the bombardment, held some villages on the Lys. At the close of each  day a night counter stroke was delivered against one or another part of  our line, but they were all repulsed.    \"Tuesday, Oct. 20, a determined but unsuccessful attack was made against  virtually the whole of our line. At one point where one of our brigades  made a counter attack 1,100 German dead were found in a trench and forty  prisoners were taken.\"    The narrative points out that the advance of the Allies has been  hindered by the weather and the nature of the ground, together with the  impossibility of knowing beforehand the reception that advance  detachments were likely to meet in approaching any village or town. \"One  place may be evacuated hastily as untenable,\" the recital continues,  \"while another in the same general line will continue to resist for a  considerable time. In some villages the inhabitants meet our cyclists  with kisses, while at the next one the roads will, in all probability,  have trenches cut across them and blocked with barricades and machine  guns. Under these circumstances an incautious advance is severely  punished, and it is impossible for large bodies of troops to push on  until the front has been thoroughly reconnoitred. This work requires the  highest qualities from our cavalry, our cyclists, and our advanced  guards.    Armored motor cars equipped with machine guns are now playing a part in  the war, and have been most successful in dealing with small parties of  German mounted troops. In their employment our gallant allies, the  Belgians, who are now fighting with us and acquitting themselves nobly,  have shown themselves to be experts. They appear to regard Uhlan hunting  as a form of sport. The crews display the utmost dash and skill in this  form of warfare, often going out several miles ahead of their own  advanced troops and seldom failing to return loaded with spoils in the  shape of lancers' caps, busbies, helmets, lances, rifles, and other  trophies, which they distribute as souvenirs to the crowds in the market  places of the frontier towns.    Although the struggle in the northern area naturally attracts more  attention than the one in the Aisne, the fighting in this region still  continues. Although there has been no alteration in the general  situation, the enemy has made certain changes in the positions of his  heavy artillery, with the result that one or two places which formerly  were safe are now subject to bombardment, while others which were  approachable only at night or by crawling on hands and knees now serve  as recreation grounds. At one point even a marquee tent has been  erected.    A story from this quarter illustrates a new use for the craters made by  the explosions of the \"Black Marias,\" the name given by the men to the  projectiles of the big German howitzers. An officer on patrol stumbled  in the dark on the German trenches. He turned and made for the British  lines, but the fire directed at him was so heavy that he had to throw  himself on the ground and crawl. There was no cover at hand, and his  chances looked desperate, when he saw close by an enormous hole in the  ground made by one of these large shells. Into this he scrambled and  remained there for a night and a day. When night again came he succeeded  in reaching our lines in safety.    Official casualty lists of recent date which have been captured show  that the losses of the Germans continue to be heavy. One single list  shows that a company of German infantry had 139 men killed and wounded,  or more than half of its war establishment. Other companies suffered  almost as heavily. It further appears that the number of men reported  missing--that is, those who have fallen into the hands of the enemy or  who have become marauders--is much greater in the reserve battalions  than in the first line units. This is evidence of the inferior quality  of some of the reserves now being brought up to reinforce the enemy  field army, and it is all the more encouraging, since every day adds to  our first line strength.    The arrival of the Indian contingents caused every one to realize that  while the enemy was filling his depleted ranks with immature levies, we  have large reserves of perfectly fresh and thoroughly trained troops to  draw upon.
