[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#16)"],[1,"cockroaches mentioned in  Chapter II (p. 15), or certain generations of virgin females are  wingless, for example aphids (pp. 18-19) and gall-flies (pp. 94-5).  Insects may thus become secondarily wingless, that is to say be  manifestly the offspring of winged parents, and such wingless forms may  on the other hand give rise to offspring or descendants with  well-developed wings. Frequently, as in the case of the aphids, many  wingless generations intervene between two winged generations. A  striking illustration of this fact is afforded by an aquatic bug, _Velia  currens_, commonly to be seen skating over the surface of running water.  The adults of Velia are nearly always wingless, but now and then the  naturalist meets with a specimen provided with functional wings, the  possession of which enables the insect to make its way to a fresh  stream. Moreover there are whole orders of parasitic insects, such as  the lice and fleas, which, showing clear affinity to orders of winged  insects, are believed to be secondarily wingless. These orders are  designated by Sharp 'Anapterygota.' And from the analogy of the periodic  loss and recovery of wings in various generations of the same species,  he has concluded that the gap between the exopterygote and the  endopterygote method of development may have been bridged by an  anapterygote condition; that the ancestors of those insects with  complete transformations were the wingless descendants of primitive  insects which grew their wings from visible external rudiments, and  that in later times re-acquiring wings, they developed these organs in a  new way, from inwardly directed rudiments or imaginal buds.    This theory of Sharp's is original, daring, and ingenious, but the loss  and re-acquisition of wings which it presupposes is difficult to imagine  in large groups during a prolonged evolutionary history, while the  sudden appearance of a totally new mode of wing-growth in the offspring  of wingless insects would be an extreme example of discontinuity in  development.    On the whole the most probable suggestion which can be made as to the  origin of 'complete' transformation in insects is that the instar in  which wings were first visible externally became later and later in the  course of the evolution of the more highly organised groups. In this way  a gradual transition from the exopterygote to the endopterygote type of  life-story is at least conceivable. It will be remembered that a may-fly  (p. 33) undergoes a moult after acquiring functional wings, emerging  into the air as a 'sub-imago.' In not a few endopterygote insects, the  pupa shows more or less activity, swimming through water intermittently  (gnats) or just before the imago has to emerge (caddis-flies); working  its way out of the ground (crane-flies) or coming half-way out of its  cocoon (many moths). The pupa of the higher insects almost certainly  corresponds with the may-fly's sub-imago, and the facts just recalled as  to remnants of pupal activity suggest that in the ancestors of  endopterygote insects what is now the pupal instar was represented by an  active nymphal or sub-imaginal stage, possibly indeed by more than one  stage, as Packard and other writers have stated that pupae of bees and  wasps undergo two or three moults before the final exposure of the  imago. Such an early pupal instar has been defined as a 'pro-nymph' or a  'semi-pupa.' Examples have been given of the exceptional passive  condition of the penultimate instar in Exopterygota. The instars  preceding this presumably had originally outward wing-rudiments in all  insect life-histories, and the endopterygote condition was attained by  the postponement of the outward appearance of these to successively  later stages. The leg and wing rudiments of the male coccid (pp. 20-1)  beneath the cuticle of the second instar are strictly comparable to  imaginal buds, and these are present in one instar of what is generally  regarded as an exopterygote life-history. The first instar in all  insects has no visible wing-rudiments, but when they grow outwardly from  the body, they necessarily become covered with cuticle, so that they  must be visible after the first moult. There is no supreme difficulty in  supposing that the important change was for these early rudiments to  become sunk into the body, so that the cuticle of the second, and,  later, of the third and succeeding instars, showed no outward sign of  their presence. This suggestion is confirmed by Heymons' (1896, 1907)  observation of the occasional appearance of outward wing-rudiments on  the thoracic segments of a mealworm, the larva of the beetle _Tenebrio  molitor_, and by F. Silvestri's discovery (1905) of a 'pro-nymph' stage  with short external wing-rudiments between the second larval and the  pupal instars of the small ground-beetle _Lebia scapularis_. Whatever  may be the exact explanation of these abnormalities, they show that in  the life-story of the higher insects outward wing-rudiments may even yet  appear before the pupal stage, confirming our belief that such  appearance is an ancestral character. The inward growth of these  wing-rudiments may well have been correlated with a difference in form  between the newly-hatched insect and its parent. As this difference  persisted until a constantly later stage, and the pre-imaginal instar  became necessarily a stage for reconstruction, the present condition of  complete metamorphosis in the more highly organised orders was finally  attained.    To explain satisfactorily these complex life-stories is however  admittedly a difficult task. The acquisition of wings is, as we have  seen, a dominating feature in them all, but if we try to go yet a step  farther back and speculate on the origin of wings in the most primitive  exopterygote insects, the task becomes still more difficult. Many years  ago Gegenbaur (1878) was struck by the correspondence of insect wings to  the tracheal gills of may-fly larvae, which are carried on the abdominal  segments somewhat as wings are on the thoracic segments. But Boerner has  recently (1909) brought forward evidence that these abdominal gills  really correspond serially with legs. Moreover Gegenbaur's theory  suggests that the ancestral insects were aquatic, whereas the presence  of tubes for breathing atmospheric air in well-nigh all members of the  class, and the fact that aquatic adaptations, respiratory and otherwise,  in insect-larvae are secondary force the student to regard the ancestral  insects as terrestrial. It is indeed highly probable that insects had a  common origin with aquatic Crustacea, but all the evidence points to the  ancestors of insects having become breathers of atmospheric air before  they acquired wings. How the wings arose, what function their precursors  performed before they became capable of supporting flight, we can hardly  even guess.    Our study of the life-story of insects, therefore, while it has taught  us something of what is going on around us to-day, and has given us  hints of the course of a few threads of that long life-story which runs  through the ages, brings us face to face with the most instructive, if  humbling fact that 'there are many more things of which we are  ignorant.' The passage from creeping to flight, as the caterpillar  becomes transformed into the butterfly, was a mystery to those who first  observed it, and many of its aspects remain mysterious still. Perhaps  the most striking result of the study of insect transformation is the  appreciation of the divergent specialisation of larva and imago, and it  is a suggestive thought that of the two the larva has in many cases  diverged the more from the typical condition. The caterpillar crawling  over the leaf, or the fly-grub swimming through the water, may thus be  regarded as a creature preparing for a change to the true conditions of  its life. It is a strange irony that the preparation is often far longer  than the brief hours of achievement. But the light which research has  thrown on the nature of these wonderful life-stories, the demonstration  of the unseen presence and growth within the insect, during its time of  preparation among strange surroundings, of the organs required for  service in the coming life amid its native air, confirm surely the  intuition of the old-time students, who saw in these changes, so  familiar and yet so wonderful, a parable and a prophecy of the higher  nature of man.

All I know is that it is five days since he was here for  meat and drink for himself and for the others--five days and five  nights, mind you; and little enough he took away; and those in  hiding no' used to such sore lying, I'll be thinking. He must try  to get through to-night. But that quietness, with no one to be  seen from daylight till dark, I do not like it, Morag. They must  know something. They must be watching.    (_A sound is heard by both women. They stand listening._)    MARY STEWART. Haste you with the light, Morag.    MORAG. But it came from the back of the house--from the hillside.    MARY STEWART. Do as I tell you. The other side may be watched.    (_A candle is lit and placed in the window. Girl goes hurrying to  the door._)    MARY STEWART. Stop, stop! Would you be opening the door with a  light like that shining from the house? A man would be seen  against it in the doorway for a mile. And who knows what eyes may  be watching? Put out the light now and cover the fire.    (_Room is reduced to semi-darkness, and the door unbarred. Someone  enters._)    MORAG. You are cold, Dugald!    (STEWART, _very exhausted, signs assent._)    MORAG. And wet, oh, wet through and through!    STEWART. Erricht Brig was guarded, well guarded. I had to win  across the water.    (_The old woman has now relit candle and taken away plaid from  fire._)    MARY STEWART. Erricht Brig--then--    STEWART (_nods_). Yes--in a corrie, on the far side of Dearig,  half-way up.    MARY STEWART. Himself is there then?    STEWART. Aye, and Keppoch as well, and another and a greater is  with them.    MARY STEWART. Wheest! (_Glances at_ MORAG.)    STEWART. Mother, is it that you can--    MARY STEWART. Yes, yes, Morag will bring out the food for ye to  carry back. It is under the hay in the barn, well hid. Morag will  bring it.--Go, Morag, and bring it.    (MORAG _enters other room or barn which opens on right._)    STEWART. Mother, I wonder at ye; Morag would never tell--never.    MARY STEWART. Morag is only a lass yet. She has never been tried.  And who knows what she might be made to tell.    STEWART. Well, well, it is no matter, for I was telling you where  I left them, but not where I am to _find_ them.    MARY STEWART. They are not where you said now?    STEWART. No; they left the corrie last night, and I am to find  them (_whispers_) in a quiet part on Rannoch moor.    MARY STEWART. It is as well for a young lass not to be knowing.  Do not tell her.    (_He sits down at table; the old woman ministers to his wants._)    STEWART. A fire is a merry thing on a night like this; and a roof  over the head is a great comfort.    MARY STEWART. Ye'll no' can stop the night?    STEWART. No. I must be many a mile from here before the day  breaks on Ben Dearig.    (MORAG _reenters._)    MORAG. It was hard to get through, Dugald?    STEWART. You may say that. I came down Erricht for three miles,  and then when I reached low country I had to take to walking in  the burns because of the snow that shows a man's steps and tells  who he is to them that can read; and there's plenty can do that  abroad, God knows.    MORAG. But none spied ye?    STEWART. Who can tell? Before dark came, from far up on the  slopes of Dearig I saw soldiers about; and away towards the  Rannoch Moor they were scattered all over the country like black  flies on a white sheet. A wild cat or anything that couldna fly  could never have got through. And men at every brig and ford and  pass! I had to strike away up across the slopes again; and even  so as I turned round the bend beyond Kilrain I ran straight into  a sentry sheltering behind a great rock. But after that it was  easy going.    MORAG. How could that be?    STEWART. Well, you see I took the boots off him, and then I had  no need to mind who might see my steps in the snow.    MORAG. You took the boots off him!    STEWART (_laughing_). I did that same. Does that puzzle your bonny  head? How does a lad take the boots off a redcoat? Find out the  answer, my lass, while I will be finishing my meat.    MORAG. Maybe he was asleep?    STEWART. Asleep! Asleep! Well, well, he sleeps sound enough now,  with the ten toes of him pointed to the sky.    (_The old woman has taken up dirk from table. She puts it down  again._ MORAG _sees the action and pushes dirk away so that it  rolls off the table and drops to the floor. She hides her face in  her hands._)    MARY STEWART. Morag, bring in the kebbuck o' cheese. Now that all  is well and safe it is we that will look after his comfort  to-night. (MORAG _goes into barn._)--I mind well her mother saying  to me--it was one day in the black winter that she died, when the  frost took the land in its grip and the birds fell stiff from the  trees, and the deer came down and put their noses to the door--I  mind well her saying just before she died--    (_Loud knocking at the door._)    A VOICE. In the King's name!    (_Both rise._)    MARY STEWART. The hay in the barn, quick, my son.    (_Knocking continues._)    A VOICE. Open in the King's name!    (STEWART _snatches up such articles as would reveal his presence  and hurries into barn. He overlooks dirk on floor. The old woman  goes towards door._)    MARY STEWART. Who is there? What do you want?    A VOICE. Open, open.    (MARY STEWART _opens door and_ CAMPBELL OF KILMHOR _follows_ CAPTAIN  SANDEMAN _into the house. Behind_ KILMHOR _comes a man carrying a  leather wallet_, JAMES MACKENZIE, _his clerk. The rear is brought  up by soldiers carrying arms._)    SANDEMAN. Ha, the bird has flown.    CAMPBELL (_who has struck dirk with his foot and picked it up_).  But the nest is warm; look at this.    SANDEMAN. It seems as if we had disturbed him at supper. Search  the house, men.    MARY STEWART. I'm just a lonely old woman. You have been  misguided. I was getting through my supper.    CAMPBELL (_holding up dirk_). And this was your toothpick, eh? Na!  Na! We ken whaur we are, and wha we want, and by Cruachan, I  think we've got him.    (_Sounds are heard from barn, and soldiers return with MORAG. She  has stayed in hiding from fear, and she still holds the cheese in  her hands._)    SANDEMAN. What have we here?    CAMPBELL. A lass!    MARY STEWART. It's just my dead brother's daughter. She was  getting me the cheese, as you can see.    CAMPBELL. On, men, again: the other turtle doo will no' be far  away. (_Banteringly to the old woman_) Tut, tut, Mistress Stewart,  and do ye have her wait upon ye while your leddyship dines alane!  A grand way to treat your dead brother's daughter; fie, fie, upon  ye!    (_Soldiers reappear with_ STEWART, _whose arms are pinioned._)    CAMPBELL. Did I no' tell ye! And this, Mrs. Stewart, will be your  dead sister's son, I'm thinking; or aiblins your leddyship's  butler! Weel, woman, I'll tell ye this: Pharaoh spared ae butler,  but Erchie Campbell will no' spare anither. Na! na! Pharaoh's  case is no' to be taken as forming ony preceedent. And so if he  doesna answer certain questions we have to speir at him, before  morning he'll hang as high as Haman.    (STEWART _is placed before the table at which_ CAMPBELL _has seated  himself. Two soldiers guard_ STEWART. _Another is behind_ CAMPBELL'S  _chair and another is by the door. The clerk_, MACKENZIE, _is seated  at up corner of table._ SANDEMAN _stands by the fire._)    CAMPBELL (_to STEWART_). Weel, sir, it is within the cognizance of  the law that you have knowledge and information of the place of  harbor and concealment used by certain persons who are in a state  of proscription. Furthermore, it is known that four days ago  certain other proscribed persons did join with these, and that  they are banded together in an endeavor to secure the escape from  these dominions of His Majesty, King George, of certain persons  who by their crimes and treasons lie open to the capital charge.  What say ye?    (STEWART _makes no reply._)    CAMPBELL. Ye admit this then?    (STEWART _as before._)    CAMPBELL. Come, come, my lad. Ye stand in great jeopardy. Great  affairs of state lie behind this which are beyond your simple  understanding. Speak up and it will be the better for ye.    (STEWART _silent as before._)    CAMPBELL. Look you. I'll be frank with you. No harm will befall  you this night--and I wish all in this house to note my words--no  harm will befall you this night if you supply the information  required.    (STEWART _as before._)    CAMPBELL (_with sudden passion_). Sandeman, put your sword to the  carcass o' this muckle ass and see will it louse his tongue.    STEWART. It may be as well then, Mr. Campbell, that I should say  a word to save your breath. It is this: Till you talk Rannoch  Loch to the top of Schiehallion, ye'll no' talk me into a yea or  nay.    CAMPBELL (_quietly_). Say ye so? Noo, I widna be so very sure if I  were you. I've had a lairge experience o' life, and speaking out  of it I would say that only fools and the dead never change their  minds.    STEWART (_quietly too_). Then you'll be adding to your experience  to-night, Mr. Campbell, and you'll have something to put on to  the other side of it.    CAMPBELL (_tapping his snuff-box_). Very possibly, young sir, but  what I would present for your consideration is this: While ye may  be prepared to keep your mouth shut under the condition of a  fool, are ye equally prepared to do so in the condition of a dead  man?    (CAMPBELL _waits expectantly._ STEWART _silent as before._)    CAMPBELL. Tut, tut, now, if it's afraid ye are, my lad, with my  hand on my heart and on my word as a gentleman--    STEWART. Afraid!    (_He spits in contempt towards_ CAMPBELL.)    CAMPBELL (_enraged_). Ye damned stubborn Hieland stot. (_To_  SANDEMAN) Have him taken out. We'll get it another way.    (CAMPBELL _rises._ STEWART _is moved into barn by soldiers._)    CAMPBELL (_walking_). Some puling eediots, Sandeman, would applaud  this contumacy and call it constancy."]]]
