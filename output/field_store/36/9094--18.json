Running hard to the help of Mr. Raeburn was the youngest Britling boy, a  beautiful contrast. It was like a puff ball supporting and assisting a  conger eel. In front of Mr. Direck the little stout man was being alert.  Teddy was supporting the attack near the middle of the field, crying  \"Centre!\" while Mr. Britling, very round and resolute, was bouncing  straight towards the threatened goal. But Mrs. Teddy, running as swiftly  as her sister, was between Teddy and the ball. Whack! the little short  man's stick had clashed with Cecily's. Confused things happened with  sticks and feet, and the little short man appeared to be trying to cut  down Cecily as one cuts down a tree, she tried to pass the ball to her  centre forward--too late, and then Mrs. Teddy had intercepted it, and  was flickering back towards Mr. Britling's goal in a rush in which Mr.  Direck perceived it was his duty to join.    Yes, he had to follow up Mrs. Teddy and pick up the ball if he had a  chance and send it in to her or the captain or across to the left  forwards, as circumstances might decide. It was perfectly clear.    Then came his moment. The little formidably padded lady who had dined at  the Dower House overnight, made a gallant attack upon Mrs. Teddy. Out of  the confusion of this clash the ball spun into Mr. Direck's radius.  Where should he smite and how? A moment of reflection was natural.    But now the easy-fitting discipline of the Dower House style of hockey  became apparent. Mr. Direck had last observed the tall young Indian  gentleman, full of vitality and anxious for destruction, far away in the  distance on the opposing right wing. But now, regardless of the more  formal methods of the game, this young man had resolved, without further  delay and at any cost, to hit the ball hard, and he was travelling like  some Asiatic typhoon with an extreme velocity across the remonstrances  of Mr. Britling and the general order of his side. Mr. Direck became  aware of him just before his impact. There was a sort of collision from  which Mr. Direck emerged with a feeling that one side of his face was  permanently flattened, but still gallantly resolved to hit the  comparatively lethargic ball. He and the staggered but resolute Indian  clashed sticks again. And Mr. Direck had the best of it. Years of  experience couldn't have produced a better pass to the captain....    \"Good pass!\"    Apparently from one of the London visitors.    But this was _some_ game!    The ball executed some rapid movements to and fro across the field. Our  side was pressing hard. There was a violent convergence of miscellaneous  backs and suchlike irregulars upon the threatened goal. Mr. Britling's  dozen was rapidly losing its disciplined order. One of the sidecar  ladies and the gallant Indian had shifted their activities to the  defensive back, and with them was a spectacled gentleman waving his  stick, high above all recognised rules. Mr. Direck's captain and both  Britling boys hurried to join the fray. Mr. Britling, who seemed to Mr.  Direck to be for a captain rather too demagogic, also ran back to rally  his forces by loud cries. \"Pass outwardly!\" was the burthen of his  contribution.    The struggle about the Britling goal ceased to be a game and became  something between a fight and a social gathering. Mr. Britling's  goal-keeper could be heard shouting, \"I can't see the ball! _Lift your  feet!_\" The crowded conflict lurched towards the goal posts. \"My shin!\"  cried Mr. Manning. \"No, you _don't!_\"    Whack, but again whack!    Whack! \"Ah! _would_ you?\" Whack.    \"Goal!\" cried the side-car gentleman.    \"Goal!\" cried the Britling boys....    Mr. Manning, as goal-keeper, went to recover the ball, but one of the  Britling boys politely anticipated him.    The crowd became inactive, and then began to drift back to loosely  conceived positions.    \"It's no good swarming into goal like that,\" Mr. Britling, with a faint  asperity in his voice, explained to his followers. \"We've got to keep  open and not _crowd_ each other.\"    Then he went confidentially to the energetic young Indian to make some  restrictive explanation of his activities.    Mr. Direck strolled back towards Cecily. He was very warm and a little  blown, but not, he felt, disgraced. He was winning.    \"You'll have to take your coat off,\" she said.    It was a good idea.    It had occurred to several people and the boundary line was already  dotted with hastily discarded jackets and wraps and so forth. But the  lady in the motoring dust coat was buttoning it to the chin.    \"One goal love,\" said the minor Britling boy.    \"We haven't begun yet, Sunny,\" said Cecily.    \"Sonny! That's American,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"No. We call him Sunny Jim,\" said Cecily. \"They're bullying off again.\"    \"Sunny Jim's American too,\" said Mr. Direck, returning to his place....    The struggle was resumed. And soon it became clear that the first goal  was no earnest of the quality of the struggle. Teddy and Cecily formed a  terribly efficient combination. Against their brilliant rushes,  supported in a vehement but effective manner by the Indian to their  right and guided by loud shoutings from Mr. Britling (centre), Mr.  Direck and the side-car lady and Mr. Raeburn struggled in vain. One  swift advance was only checked by the dust cloak, its folds held the  ball until help arrived; another was countered by a tremendous swipe of  Mr. Raeburn's that sent the ball within an inch of the youngest  Britling's head and right across the field; the third resulted in a  swift pass from Cecily to the elder Britling son away on her right, and  he shot the goal neatly and swiftly through the lattice of Mr. Lawrence  Carmine's defensive movements. And after that very rapidly came another  goal for Mr. Britling's side and then another.    Then Mr. Britling cried out that it was \"Half Time,\" and explained to  Mr. Direck that whenever one side got to three goals they considered it  was half time and had five minutes' rest and changed sides. Everybody  was very hot and happy, except the lady in the dust cloak who was  perfectly cool. In everybody's eyes shone the light of battle, and not a  shadow disturbed the brightness of the afternoon for Mr. Direck except a  certain unspoken anxiety about Mr. Raeburn's trousers.    You see Mr. Direck had never seen Mr. Raeburn before, and knew nothing  about his trousers.    They appeared to be coming down.    To begin with they had been rather loose over the feet and turned up,  and as the game progressed, fold after fold of concertina-ed flannel  gathered about his ankles. Every now and then Mr. Raeburn would seize  the opportunity of some respite from the game to turn up a fresh six  inches or so of this accumulation. Naturally Mr. Direck expected this  policy to end unhappily. He did not know that the flannel trousers of  Mr. Raeburn were like a river, that they could come down forever and  still remain inexhaustible....    He had visions of this scene of happy innocence being suddenly blasted  by a monstrous disaster....    Apart from this worry Mr. Direck was as happy as any one there!    Perhaps these apprehensions affected his game. At any rate he did  nothing that pleased him in the second half, Cecily danced all over him  and round and about him, and in the course of ten minutes her side had  won the two remaining goals with a score of Five-One; and five goals is  \"game\" by the standards of Matching's Easy.    And then with the very slightest of delays these insatiable people  picked up again. Mr. Direck slipped away and returned in a white silk  shirt, tennis trousers and a belt. This time he and Cecily were on the  same side, the Cecily-Teddy combination was broken, and he it seemed was  to take the place of the redoubtable Teddy on the left wing with her.    This time the sides were better chosen and played a long, obstinate,  even game. One-One. One-Two. One-Three. (Half Time.) Two-Three. Three  all. Four-Three. Four all....    By this time Mr. Direck was beginning to master the simple strategy of  the sport. He was also beginning to master the fact that Cecily was the  quickest, nimblest, most indefatigable player on the field. He scouted  for her and passed to her. He developed tacit understandings with her.  Ideas of protecting her had gone to the four winds of Heaven. Against  them Teddy and a sidecar girl with Raeburn in support made a memorable  struggle. Teddy was as quick as a cat. \"Four-Three\" looked like winning,  but then Teddy and the tall Indian and Mrs. Teddy pulled square. They  almost repeated this feat and won, but Mr. Manning saved the situation  with an immense oblique hit that sent the ball to Mr. Direck. He ran  with the ball up to Raeburn and then dodged and passed to Cecily. There  was a lively struggle to the left; the ball was hit out by Mr. Raeburn  and thrown in by a young Britling; lost by the forwards and rescued by  the padded lady. Forward again! This time will do it!    Cecily away to the left had worked round Mr. Raeburn once more. Teddy,  realising that things were serious, was tearing back to attack her.    Mr. Direck supported with silent intentness. \"Centre!\" cried Mr.  Britling. \"Cen-tre!\"    \"Mr. Direck!\" came her voice, full of confidence. (Of such moments is  the heroic life.) The ball shot behind the hurtling Teddy. Mr. Direck  stopped it with his foot, a trick he had just learnt from the eldest  Britling son. He was neither slow nor hasty. He was in the half-circle,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14070"],[0,"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures (#16)"],[1,"\" \"The _peasantry go_ barefoot;\" \"The _flock is_ his object;\"  instead of, \"_My people doth_ not consider;\" \"The _peasantry goes_  barefoot;\" \"The _flock are_ his object.\" In instances like these, the  application of the foregoing rules _may_ be of some use; but the  constructions in which they do not apply, are probably more numerous  than those in which they do.    EXERCISES IN PARSING.    Nom. case.    Intran. verb.   Nom. case.    Intran. verb.  Men           labor.          The sun       sets.  Armies        march.          The moon      rises.

Your improvement in grammar depends, not on the number of words which  you parse, but on the _attention_ which you give the subject. _You may  parse the same exercises several times over._    For the gratification of those who prefer it, I here present another    DIVISION OF VERBS.    Verbs are of two kinds, transitive and intransitive.    A verb is transitive when the action affects an object; as, \"Earthquakes  _rock_ kingdoms; thrones and palaces _are shaken_ down; and potentates,  princes, and subjects, _are buried_ in one common grave.\"    The nominative to a passive verb, is the _object_, but not the _agent_,  of the action.    A verb is intransitive when it has no object; as, \"The waters _came_  upon me;\" \"I _am_ he who _was_, and _is_, and _is_ to _come_.\"    As an exercise on what you have been studying, I will now put to you a  few questions, all of which you ought to be able to answer before you  proceed any farther.

Perhaps no subject has, in this age, elicited more patient research,      and critical investigation of original, constituent principles,      formations, and combinations, than the English language. The      legitimate province of philology, however, as I humbly conceive,      has, in some instances, been made to yield to that of philosophy, so      far as to divert the attention from the combinations of our language      which refinement has introduced, to radical elements and      associations which no way concern the progress of literature, or the      essential use for which language was intended. Were this      retrogressive mode of investigating and applying principles, to      obtain, among philologists, the ascendency over that which      accommodates the use of language to progressive refinement, it is      easy to conceive the state of barbarism to which society would, in a      short time, be reduced. Moreover, if what some call the philosophy      of language, were to supersede, altogether, the province of      philology as it applies to the present, progressive and refined      state of English literature, the great object contemplated by the      learned, in all ages, namely, the approximation of language, in      common with every thing else, to that point of perfection at which      it is the object of correct philology to arrive, would be      frustrated.        The dubious and wildering track struck out by those innovators and      visionaries who absurdly endeavor to teach modern English, by      rejecting the authority and sanction of custom, and by conducting      the learner back to the original combinations, and the detached,      disjointed, and barbarous constructions of our progenitors, both      prudence and reason, as well as a due regard for correct philology,      impel me to shun. Those modest writers who, by bringing to their aid      a little sophistry, much duplicity, and a wholesale traffic in the      swelling phrases, \"philosophy, reason, and common sense,\" attempt to      overthrow the wisdom of former ages, and show that the result of all      the labors of those distinguished philologists who had previously      occupied the field of grammatical science, is nothing but error and      folly, will doubtless meet the neglect and contempt justly merited      by such consummate vanity and unblushing pedantry. Fortunately for      those who employ our language as their vehicle of mental conference,      custom will not yield to the speculative theories of the visionary.      If it would, improvement in English literature would soon be at an      end, and we should be tamely conducted back to the Vandalic age.        As the use of what is commonly called the philosophy of language, is      evidently misapplied by those who make it the test of _grammatical      certainty_, it may not be amiss to offer a few considerations with a      view to expose the fallacy of so vague a criterion.        All reasoning and investigation which depend on the philosophy of      language for an ultimate result, must be conducted _a posteriori_.      Its office, according to the ordinary mode of treating the subject,      is to trace language to its origin, not for the purpose of      determining and fixing grammatical associations and dependances,      such as the agreement, government, and mutual relations of words,      but in order to analyze combinations with a view to develop the      first principles of the language, and arrive at the primitive      meaning of words. Now, it is presumed, that no one who has paid      critical attention to the subject, will contend, that the original      import of single words, has any relation to the syntactical      dependances and connexions of words in general;--to gain a knowledge      of which, is the leading object of the student in grammar. And,      furthermore, I challenge those who have indulged in such useless      vagaries, to show by what process, with their own systems, they can      communicate a practical knowledge of grammar. I venture to predict,      that, if they make the attempt, they will find their systems more      splendid in theory, than useful in practice.        Again, it cannot rationally be contended, that the radical meaning      has any efficiency in controlling the signification which, by the      power of association, custom has assigned to many words;--a      signification _essentially different_ from the original import. Were      this the case, and were the language now to be taught and understood      in compliance with the original import of words, it would have to      undergo a thorough change; to be analyzed, divided, and sub-divided,      almost _ad infinitum_. Indeed, there is the same propriety in      asserting that the Gothic, Danish, and Anglo-Saxon elements in our      language, ought to be pronounced separately, to enable us to      understand our vernacular tongue, that there is in contending, that      their primitive meaning has an ascendency over the influence of the      principle of association in changing, and the power of custom in      determining, the import of words. Many of our words are derived from      the Greek, Roman, French, Spanish, Italian, and"]]]
