BUCKELEW & MARGARET W. LEWIS.    Part I.--THE HUMAN BODY.    TEACHERS' EDITION.    A TRANSCRIPT OF LESSONS GIVEN IN THE PRIMARY DEPARTMENT OF GRAMMAR SCHOOL  NO. 49, NEW YORK CITY.    This work was prepared especially to aid Teachers in giving oral  instructions in Physiology to Primary and Intermediate Classes. It is,  perhaps, the only Physiology published that is suitable for these grades.  Considerable attention is paid to the subject of Alcohol and Narcotics.        \"First is given _a model lesson_; second, _a formula_, embodying the      principal facts given during the development and teaching; third,      _questions for the formula_; fourth, _directions for teaching_; and      fifth, _questions on the lesson_. These last are important. A full plan      of lessons is given for each week for five months, in each of six      grades, showing exactly how much work ought to be attempted. No book      could be made more helpful to teachers. To the thousands who are      asking, 'Tell us how to teach,' here are full, minute, and correct      instructions. Even the answers expected are given, blackboard outlines      are arranged, and nothing is wanting to make the book as useful to      teachers as it is possible for any book to be. It ought to have a large      sale. No book published during the last ten years will do more to drive      away routine from the school-room and introduce thought than this, _if      only the teachers will use it_. Its introduction displaces nothing but      the old-fashioned monotonous recitations. Let them go; we welcome this      book as an important aid in hastening along the good time of better      teaching. It is excellently printed, with good paper and      binding.\"--_The New York School Journal._    Illustrated.

MAYO says, in the _New England Journal of Education_:      \"Although we have given place in our book-notice column to an      appreciative mention of the volume, 'Development Lessons,' a new      reading seems to call for a new commendation of this admirable guide to      teachers. Mr. DeGraff needs no special 'boom' as a first-class      institute man, and his extracts of lectures in Part III. sparkle with      valuable suggestions. In no published work is Col. Parker really seen      to such advantage as in the 'reports of conversations' with him in Part      II., which can be studied with profit by every teacher. But perhaps the      most complete portion of this admirable book is the 178 pages of      lessons on the Senses, Size, Form, Place, Plants, and Insects, by MISS      M.K.

FEELING DEEPLY DURING PERFORMANCE    \"I feel the meaning of the music, the tragedy or comedy, the sadness or  gayety of it each time I perform it, but not, as a rule, to the extent  of being entirely worn out with emotion. It depends, however, on the  occasion. If you are singing in a foreign language, which the audience  does not understand, you make every effort to 'put it over,' to make  them see what you are trying to tell them. You strive to make the song  intelligible in some way. You may add facial expression and gesture,  more than you would otherwise do. All this is more wearing because of  the effort involved.      LANGUAGE    \"This brings us to another point, the study of languages. The Italian  sings nearly all his roles in his own tongue, with a few learned in  French. With the Frenchman, it is the same: he sings in his own tongue  and learns some parts in Italian. But we poor Americans are forced to  learn our parts in all three languages. This, of itself, greatly adds to  our difficulties. We complain that the American sings his own language  so carelessly. An Italian, singing his own language for his own people,  may not be any more careful than we are, but he will make English, if he  attempts it, more intelligible than we do, because he takes extra care  to do so. The duty is laid upon Americans to study other languages, if  they expect to sing. I know how often this study is neglected by the  student. It is another phase of that haste to make one's way which is  characteristic of the young student and singer.    \"Take, for example, the girl in the small town, who is trying to do  something with her voice. She believes if she can get to New York, or  some other music center, and have six months' lessons with some well  known teacher, she will emerge a singer. She comes and finds living  expenses so great that only one lesson a week with the professor is  possible. There is no chance for language or diction study, or piano  lessons; yet all these she ought to have. And one vocal lesson a week is  entirely inadequate. The old way of having daily lessons was far more  successful. The present way vocal teachers give lessons is not conducive  to the best development. The pupils come in a hurry, one after another,  to get their fifteen or twenty minutes of instruction. Yet one cannot  blame the teacher for he must live.      THE IDEAL WAY    \"The ideal way is to have several lessons a week, and not to take them  in such haste. If the pupil arrives, and finds, on first essay, that her  voice is not in the best of trim, how much better to be able to wait a  bit, and try again; it might then be all right. But, as I said, under  modern conditions, this course seems not to be possible, for the teacher  must live. If only vocal lessons could be free, at least to the  talented ones! It seems sad that a gifted girl must pay to learn to  sing, when it is a very part of her, as much as the song of the bird.  Ah, if I had plenty of money, I would see that many of them should have  this privilege, without always looking at the money end of it.      AMOUNT OF DAILY PRACTICE    \"It seems to me the young singer should not practice more than two  periods of fifteen or twenty minutes each. At most one should not use  the voice more than an hour a day. We hear of people practicing hours  and hours daily, but that is probably in books. The voice cannot be  treated as the pianist or violinist does his fingers. One must handle  the voice with much more care.      OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE YOUNG SINGER IN AMERICA    \"The chances for the American singer to make a career in concert and  recital are abundant. In no other country in the world do such  opportunities exist. If she can meet the requirements, she can win both  fame and fortune on the concert stage.    \"In opera, on the other hand, opportunities are few and the outlook  anything but hopeful. Every young singer casts longing eyes at the  Metropolitan, or Chicago Opera, as the goal of all ambition. But that is  the most hopeless notion of all. No matter how beautiful the voice, it  is drill, routine, experience one needs. Without these, plus musical  reputation, how is one to succeed in one of the two opera houses of the  land? And even if one is accepted 'for small parts,' what hope is there  of rising, when some of the greatest artists of the world hold the  leading roles? What the American singer needs is opportunity to gain  experience and reputation in smaller places. Several years' drill and  routine would fit the aspirant for a much broader field. This would give  her command over her resources and herself, and perfect her voice and  impersonations, if she has the gifts and constantly studies to improve  them. Even England, so small compared to America, has seven opera  companies that travel up and down the land, giving opera; they have done  this during all the years of the war.    \"This question of providing opportunity for operatic experience in  America, is one which has long been discussed and many experiments have  been tried, without arriving at satisfactory results. What is needed is  to awaken interest in opera in small places--just little out-of-the-way  towns. My idea would be to have a regular stock local opera company, and  have the standard operas studied. Have a little orchestra of about  twenty and a small chorus. The small parts to be learned by the most  competent singers in the place. Then have the few principal roles taken  by 'guest artists,' who might make these engagements in regular route  and succession. It seems to me such a plan could be carried out, and  what a joy it would be to any small community! But people must gradually  awake to this need: it will take time.\"          XIV    =MARGUERITE D'ALVAREZ=    THE MESSAGE OF THE SINGER      A great podium backed with green, reminding one of a forest of palms;  dim lights through the vast auditorium; a majestic, black-robed figure  standing alone among the palms, pouring out her voice in song; a voice  at once vibrant, appealing, powerful, filled now with sweeping passion,  again with melting tenderness; such was the stage setting for my first  impression of Mme. Marguerite d'Alvarez, and such were some of the  emotions she conveyed.    Soon after this experience, I asked if I might have a personal talk with  the artist whose singing had made such a deep impression upon me. It was  most graciously granted, and at the appointed hour I found myself in a  charmingly appointed yet very home-like salon, chatting with this  Spanish lady from Peru, who speaks such beautiful English and is  courtesy itself.    This time it was not a somber, black-robed figure who came forward so  graciously to greet me, for above a black satin walking skirt, Madame  had added a blouse of soft creamy lace, which revealed the rounded  curves of neck and arms; the only ornament being a string of pearls  about the full throat. Later in our talk I ventured to express my  preference for creamy draperies instead of black, for the concert room;  but the singer thought otherwise. \"No,\" she said; \"my gown must be  absolutely unobtrusive--negative. I must not use it to heighten effect,  or to attract the audience to me personally. People must be drawn to me  by what I express, by my art, by what I have to give them.\"    But to begin at the beginning. In answer to my first question, \"What  must one do to become a singer?\" Madame said:    [Illustration: MARGUERITE D'ALVAREZ]    \"To become a singer, one must have a voice; that is of the first  importance. In handling and training that voice, breathing is perhaps  the most vital thing to be considered. To some breath control seems to  be second nature; others must toil for it. With me it is intuition; it  has always been natural. Breathing is such an individual thing. With  each person it is different, for no two people breathe in just the same  way, whether natural or acquired. Just as one pianist touches the keys  of the instrument in his own peculiar way, unlike the ways of all other  pianists. For instance, no two singers will deliver the opening phrase  of 'My heart at thy sweet voice,' from _Samson_, in exactly the same  way. One will expend a little more breath on some tones than on others;  one may sing it softer, another louder. Indeed how can two people ever  give out a phrase in the same way, when they each feel it differently?  The great thing is to control the management of the breath through  intelligent study. But alas,\"--with a pretty little deprecating  gesture,--\"many singers do not seem to use their intelligence in the  right way. They need to study so many things besides vocalizes and a few  songs. They ought to broaden themselves in every way. They should know  books, pictures, sculpture, acting, architecture,--in short everything  possible in the line of art, and of life. For all these things will help  them to sing more intelligently. They should cultivate all these means  of self-expression. For myself, I have had a liberal education in  music--piano, harmony, theory, composition and kindred subjects. And  then I love and study art in all its forms and manifestations.\"    \"Your first recital in New York was a rich and varied feast,\" I  remarked.    \"Indeed I feel I gave the audience too much; there was such a weight of  meaning to each song, and so many! I cannot sing indifferent or  superficial songs. I must sing those which mean much, either of sadness  or mirth, passion or exaltation. No one knows (who has not been through  it) what it means to face a great audience of strangers, knowing that  something in you must awake those people and draw them toward you: you  must bare your very soul to them and bring theirs to you, in answering  response, just by your voice. It is a wonderful thing, to bring to  masses of people a message in this way. I feel this strongly, whenever I  stand before a large audience, that with every note I sing I am"]]]
