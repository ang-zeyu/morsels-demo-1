This will make two loaves, and should remain in the oven at least  one hour; and when taken out, placed where they will cool gradually.  Dyspepsia crackers can be made with unbolted flour, water and  saleratus.    _To make Rice Bread_.--Boil a pint of rice soft; add a pint of leaven;  then, three quarts of the flour; put it to rise in a tin or earthen  vessel until it has risen sufficiently; divide it into three parts;  then bake it as other bread, and you will have three large loaves.    Heating ovens must be regulated by experience and observation.  There is a difference in wood in giving out heat; there is a great  difference in the construction of ovens; and when an oven is extremely  cold, either on account of the weather, or want of use, it must be  heated more. Economical people heat ovens with pine wood, fagots,  brush, and such light stuff. If you have none but hard wood, you must  remember that it makes very hot coals, and therefore less of it will  answer. A smart fire for an hour and a half is a general rule for  common sized family ovens, provided brown bread and beans are to be  baked. An hour is long enough to heat an oven for flour bread. Pies  bear about as much heat as flour bread: pumpkin pies will bear more.  If you are afraid your oven is too hot, throw in a little flour, and  shut it up for a minute. If it scorches black immediately, the heat is  too furious; if it merely browns, it is right. Some people wet an old  broom two or three times, and turn it round near the top of die oven  till it dries; this prevents pies and cake from scorching on the top.  When you go into a new house, heat your oven two or three times, to  get it seasoned, before you use it. After the wood is burned, rake the  coals over the bottom of the oven, and let them lie a few minutes.    Those who make their own bread should make yeast too. When bread is  nearly out, always think whether yeast is in readiness; for it takes  a day and night to prepare it. One handful of hops, with two or three  handsful of malt and rye bran, should be boiled fifteen or twenty  minutes, in two quarts of water, then strained, hung on to boil again,  and thickened with half a pint of rye and water stirred up quite  thick, and a little molasses; boil it a minute or two, and then take  it off to cool. When just about lukewarm, put in a cupful of good  lively yeast, and set it in a cool place in summer, and warm place  in winter. If it is too warm when you put in the old yeast, all the  spirit will be killed.    In summer, yeast sours easily; therefore make but little at a time.  Bottle it when it gets well a working; it keeps better when the air  is corked out. If you find it acid, but still spirited, put a little  pearlash to it, as you use it; but by no means put it into your bread  unless it foams up bright and lively as soon as the pearlash mixes  with it. Never keep yeast in tin; it destroys its life.    There is another method of making yeast, which is much easier, and I  think quite as good. Stir rye and cold water, till you make a stiff  thickening. Then pour in boiling water, and stir it all the time, till  you make it as thin as the yeast you buy; three or four table spoons  heaping full are enough for a quart of water. When it gets about cold,  put in half a pint of lively yeast. When it works well, bottle it; but  if very lively, do not cork your bottle _very_ tight, for fear it will  burst. Always think to make new yeast before the old is gone; so that  you may have some to work with. Always wash and scald your bottle  clean after it has contained sour yeast. Beware of freezing yeast.    Milk yeast is made quicker than any other. A pint of new milk with a  tea-spoonful of salt, and a large spoon of flour stirred in, set by  the fire to keep lukewarm, will make yeast fit for use in an hour.  Twice the quantity of common yeast is necessary, and unless used soon  is good for nothing. Bread made of this yeast dries sooner. It is  convenient in summer, when one wants to make biscuits suddenly.    A species of leaven may be made that will keep any length of time.  Three ounces of hops in a pail of water boiled down to a quart; strain  it, and stir in a quart of rye meal while boiling hot. Cool it, and  add half a pint of good yeast; after it has risen a few hours, thicken  it with Indian meal stiff enough to roll out upon a board; then put it  in the sun and air a few days to dry. A piece of this cake two inches  square, dissolved in warm water, and thickened with a little flour,  will make a large loaf of bread.    Potatoes make very good yeast. Mash three large potatoes fine; pour  a pint of boiling water over them; when almost cold, stir in two  spoonfuls of flour, two of molasses, and a cup of good yeast. This  yeast should be used while new.           *       *       *       *       *          PRESERVES, &C.      Economical people will seldom use preserves, except for sickness.  They are unhealthy, expensive, and useless to those who are well.  Barberries preserved in molasses are very good for common use. Boil  the molasses, skim it, throw in the barberries, and simmer them till  they are soft. If you wish to lay by a few for sickness, preserve them  in sugar by the same rule as other preserves. Melt the sugar, skim it,  throw in the barberries; when done soft, take them out, and throw in  others.    A pound of sugar to a pound of fruit is the rule for all preserves.  The sugar should be melted over a fire moderate enough not to scorch  it. When melted, it should be skimmed clean, and the fruit dropped  in to simmer till it is soft. Plums, and things of which the skin is  liable to be broken, do better to be put in little jars, with their  weight of sugar, and the jars set in a kettle of boiling water, till  the fruit is done. See the water is not so high as to boil into the  jars.    When you put preserves in jars, lay a white paper, thoroughly wet  with brandy, flat upon the surface of the preserves, and cover them  carefully from the air. If they begin to mould, scald them by setting  them in the oven till boiling hot. Glass is much better than earthen  for preserves; they are not half as apt to ferment.      CURRANT JELLY.    Currant jelly is a useful thing for sickness. If it be necessary to  wash your currants, be sure they are thoroughly drained, or your jelly  will be thin. Break them up with a pestle, and squeeze them through  a cloth. Put a pint of clean sugar to a pint of juice, and boil it  slowly, till it becomes ropy. Great care must be taken not to do it  too fast; it is spoiled by being scorched. It should be frequently  skimmed while simmering. If currants are put in a jar, and kept in  boiling water, and cooked before they are strained, they are more  likely to keep a long time without fermenting.      CURRANT WINE.    Those who have more currants than they have money, will do well to use  no wine but of their own manufacture. Break and squeeze the currants,  put three pounds and a half of sugar to two quarts of juice and  two quarts of water. Put in a keg or barrel. Do not close the bung  tight for three or four days, that the air may escape while it is  fermenting. After it is done fermenting, close it up tight. Where  raspberries are plenty, it is a great improvement to use half  raspberry juice, and half currant juice. Brandy is unnecessary when  the above-mentioned proportions are observed. It should not be used  under a year or two. Age improves it.      RASPBERRY SHRUB.    Raspberry shrub mixed with water is a pure, delicious drink for  summer; and in a country where raspberries are abundant, it is good  economy to make it answer instead of Port and Catalonia wine. Put  raspberries in a pan, and scarcely cover them with strong vinegar. Add  a pint of sugar to a pint of juice; (of this you can judge by first  trying your pan to see how much it holds;) scald it, skim it, and  bottle it when cold.      COFFEE.    As substitutes for coffee, some use dry brown bread crusts, and roast  them; others soak rye grain in rum, and roast it; others roast peas in  the same way as coffee. None of these are very good; and peas so used  are considered unhealthy. Where there is a large family of apprentices  and workmen, and coffee is very dear, it may be worth while to use the  substitutes, or to mix them half and half with coffee; but, after all,  the best economy is to go without.    French coffee is so celebrated, that it may be worth while to tell how  it is made; though no prudent housekeeper will make it, unless she has  boarders, who are willing to pay for expensive cooking.    The coffee should be roasted more than is common with us; it should  not hang drying over the fire, but should be roasted quick; it should  be ground soon after roasting, and used as soon as it is ground. Those  who pride themselves on first-rate coffee, burn it and grind it  every morning. The powder should be placed in the coffee-pot in the  proportions of an ounce to less than a pint of water. The water should  be poured upon the coffee boiling hot. The coffee should be kept at  the boiling point; but should not boil. Coffee made in this way must  be made in a biggin. It would not be clear in a common coffee-pot.    A bit of fish-skin as big as a ninepence, thrown into coffee while  it is boiling, tends to make it clear. If you use it just as it comes  from the salt-fish, it will be apt to give an unpleasant taste to the  coffee: it should be washed clean as a bit of cloth, and hung up till  perfectly dry. The white of eggs, and even egg shells are good to  settle coffee. Rind of salt pork is excellent.    Some people think coffee is richer and clearer for having a bit of  sweet butter, or a whole egg, dropped in and stirred, just before it  is done roasting, and ground up, shell and all, with the coffee. But  these things are not economical, except on a farm, where butter and  eggs are plenty. A half a gill of cold water,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#16)"],[1,"   \"Clicker-a-clicker!\" he shrieked, like a cateran shouting the  \"slogan,\" and down like a black-and-white dart--to strike the Hawk  fairly between the shoulders just as the Meadow Lark dropped in  despair to the bare ground and hid its head from the approaching  stroke of death.    \"Clicker-a-clicker\"--and the Hawk wheeled in sudden consternation.  \"Clicker-a-clicker\"--and the dauntless little warrior dropped between  his wings, stabbing and tearing.    The Hawk bucked like a mustang, the Kingbird was thrown, but sprung on  agile pinions above again.    \"Clicker-a-clicker,\" and he struck as before. Large brown feathers  were floating away on the breeze now. The Meadow Lark was forgotten.  The Hawk thought only of escape.    \"Clicker-a-clicker,\" the slogan still was heard. The Hawk was putting  on all speed to get away, but the Kingbird was riding him most of the  time. Several brown feathers floated down, the Hawk dwindled in the  distance to a Sparrow and the Kingbird to a fly dancing on his back.  The Hawk made a final plunge into a thicket, and the king came home  again, uttering the shrill war-cry once or twice, probably to let the  queen know that he was coming back, for she flew to a high branch of  the Apple tree where she could greet the returning hero. He came with  an occasional \"clicker-a-clicker\"--then, when near her, he sprung  fifty feet in the air and dashed down, screaming his slogan without  interruption, darting zigzag with the most surprising evolutions and  turns--this way, that way, sideways and downward, dealing the  deadliest blows right and left at an imaginary foe, then soared, and  did it all over again two or three times, just to show how far he was  from being tired, and how much better he could have done it had it  been necessary. Then with a final swoop and a volley of \"clickers\" he  dashed into the bush to receive the congratulations of the one for  whom it all was meant and the only spectator for whose opinion he  cared in the least.    [Illustration: \"Clicker-a-clicker!' he shrieked ... and down like a  dart.\"]    \"Now, ain't that great,\" said Sam, with evident sincerity and  pleasure. His voice startled Yan and brought him back. He had been  wholly lost in silent admiring wonder of the dauntless little  Kingbird.    A Vesper Sparrow ran along the road before them, flitting a few  feet ahead each time they overtook it and showing the white outer  tail-feathers as it flew.    \"A little Graybird,\" remarked Sam.    \"No, that isn't a Graybird; that's a Vesper Sparrow,\" exclaimed Yan,  in surprise, for he knew he was right.    \"Well, _I_ dunno,\" said Sam, yielding the point.    \"I thought you said you knew every bird that flies and all about it\"  replied his companion, for the memory of this first day was strong  with him yet.    Sam snorted: \"I didn't know you then. I was just loadin' you up so  you'd think I was a wonderful feller, an' you did, too--for awhile.\"    A Red-headed Woodpecker, carrying a yellow butterfly, flew on a fence  stake ahead of them and peeped around as they drew near. The setting  sun on his bright plumage, the lilac stake and the yellow butterfly,  completed a most gorgeous bit of colour and gave Yan a thrill of joy.  A Meadow Lark on a farther stake, a Bluebird on another, and a Vesper  Bird on a stone, each added his appeal to eye and ear, till Sam  exclaimed:    \"Oh, ain't that awful nice?\" and Yan was dumb with a sort of saddened  joy.    Birds hate the wind, and this was one of those birdy days that come  only with a dead calm.    They passed a barn with two hundred pairs of Swallows flying and  twittering around, a cut bank of the road had a colony of 1,000 Sand  Martins, a stream had its rattling Kingfishers, and a marsh was the  playground of a multitude of Red-winged Blackbirds.    Yan was lifted up with the joy of the naturalist at seeing so many  beautiful living things. Sam felt it, too; he grew very silent, and  the last half-mile to the \"Corner\" was passed without a word. The  boots were got. Sam swung them around his neck and the boys set out  for home. The sun was gone, but not the birds, and the spell of the  evening was on them still. A Song Sparrow by the brook and a Robin  high in the Elm were yet pouring out their liquid notes in the  gloaming.    \"I wish I could be always here,\" said Yan, but he started a little  when he remembered how unwilling he had been to come.    There was a long silence as they lingered on the darkening road. Each  was thinking hard.    A loud, startling but soft \"Ohoo--O-hoo--O-hoooooo,\" like the coo of a  giant dove, now sounded about their heads in a tree. They stopped and  Sam whispered, \"Owl; big Hoot Owl.\" Yan's heart leaped with pleasure.  He had read all his life of Owls, and even had seen them alive in  cages, but this was the first time he had ever heard the famous  hooting of the real live wild Owl, and it was a delicious experience.    The night was quite dark now, but there were plenty of sounds that  told of life. A Whippoorwill was chanting in the woods, a hundred  Toads and Frogs creaked and trilled, a strange rolling, laughing cry  on a marshy pond puzzled them both, then a Song Sparrow in the black  night of a dense thicket poured forth its sweet little sunshine song  with all the vigour and joy of its best daytime doing.    They listened attentively for a repetition of the serenade, when a  high-pitched but not loud \"_Wa--wa--wa--wa--wa--wa--wa--wa_!\"  reached their ears from a grove of heavy timbers.    \"Hear that?\" exclaimed Sam.    Again it came, a quavering squall, apparently much nearer. It was a  rather shrill sound, quite unbirdy, and Sam whispered:    \"Coon--that's the whicker of a Coon. We can come down here some time  when corn's 'in roastin'' an' have a Coon hunt.\"    \"Oh, Sam, wouldn't that be glorious!\" said Yan. \"How I wish it was  now. I never saw a Coon hunt or any kind of a hunt. Do we have to wait  till 'roasting-ear' time?\"    \"Oh, yes; it's easier to find them then. You say to your Coons, 'Me  an' me dogs will meet you to-night at the nearest roastin'-ear patch,'  an' sure nuff _they'll_ keep the appointment.\"    \"But they're around now, for we just heard one, _and there's  another_.\"    A long faint \"_Lil--lil--lil--lil--lil--li-looo!_\" now sounded  from the trees. It was like the other, but much softer and sweeter.    \"There's where you fool yerself,\" replied Sam, \"an' there's where many  a hunter is fooled. That last one's the call of a Screech Owl. You see  it's softer and whistlier than the Coon whicker.\"    They heard it again and again from the trees. It was a sweet musical  sound, and Yan remembered how squally the Coon call was in comparison,  and yet many hunters never learn the difference.    As they came near the tree whence the Owl called at intervals, a gray  blot went over their heads, shutting out a handful of stars for a  moment as it passed over them, but making no noise. \"There he goes,\"  whispered Sam. \"That's the Screech Owl. Not much of a screech, was  it?\" Not long afterward Yan came across a line of Lowell's which says,  \"The song of the Screech Owl is the sweetest sound in nature,\" and  appreciated the absurdity of the name.    \"I want to go on a Coon hunt,\" continued Yan, and the sentence was  just tinged with the deep-laid doggedness that was usually lost in his  courteous manner.    \"That settles it,\" answered the other, for he was learning what that  tone meant. \"We'll surely go when you talk that way, for, of coorse,  it _kin_ be done. You see, I know more about animals than birds,\"  he continued. \"I'm just as likely to be a dentist as a hunter so far  as serious business is concerned, but I'd sure love to be a hunter for  awhile, an' I made Da promise to go with me some time. Maybe we kin  get a Deer by going back ten miles to the Long Swamp. I only wish Da  and Old Caleb hadn't fought, 'cause Caleb sure knows the woods, an'  that old Hound of his has treed more Coons than ye could shake a stick  at in a month o' Sundays.\"    \"Well, if that's the only Coon dog around, I'm going to get him.  You'll see,\" was the reply.    \"I believe you will,\" answered Sam, in a tone of mixed admiration and  amusement.    It was ten o'clock when they got home, and every one was in bed but  Mr. Raften. The boys turned in at once, but next morning, on going  to the barn, they found that Si had not only sewed on and hemmed the  smoke-flaps, but had resewn the worst of the patches and hemmed the  whole bottom of the teepee cover with a small rope in the hem, so that  they were ready now for the pins and poles.    The cover was taken at once to the camp ground. Yan carried the axe.  When they came to the brush fence over the creek at the edge of the  swamp, he said:    \"Sam, I want to blaze that trail for old Caleb. How do you do it?\"    \"Spot the trees with the axe every few yards.\"    \"This way?\" and Yan cut a tree in three places, so as to show three  white spots or blazes.    \"No; that's a trapper's blaze for a trap or a 'special blaze', but  a 'road blaze' is one on the front of the tree and one on the  back--so--then ye can run the trail both ways, an' you put them  thicker if it's to be followed at night.\"          VIII    The Sacred Fire      \"Ten strong poles and two long thin ones,\" said Yan, reading off. These  were soon cut and brought to the camp ground.    \"Tie them together the same height as the teepee cover----\"    \"Tie them? With what?\"    \"'Rawhide rope,' he said, but he also said 'Make the cover of skins.'  I'm afraid we shall have to use common rope for the present,\" and Yan  looked a little ashamed of the admission.    \"I reckoned so,\" drawled Sam, \"and so I put a coil of quarter-inch in  the cover, but I didn't dare to tell you that up at the barn.\"    The tripod was firmly lashed with the rope and set up. Nine poles were  duly leaned around in a twelve-foot circle, for a teepee twelve feet  high usually has a twelve-foot base. A final"]]]
