'Put him in a steeple-chase, and you'd get your money  back in ten minutes, and a bagful to boot.'    'True,' observed Mr. Thornton, treasuring that fact up as an additional  inducement to use to his friend.    So the amiable gentlemen parted.          CHAPTER XI    THE DEAL, AND THE DISASTER      If people are inclined to deal, bargains can very soon be struck at idle  watering-places, where anything in the shape of occupation is a godsend,  and bargainers know where to find each other in a minute. Everybody knows  where everybody is.    'Have you seen Jack Sprat?'    'Oh yes; he's just gone into Muddle's Bazaar with Miss Flouncey, looking  uncommon sweet.' Or--    'Can you tell me where I shall find Mr. Slowman?'    Answer.--'You'll find him at his lodgings, No. 15, Belvidere Terrace, till  a quarter before seven. He's gone home to dress, to dine with Major and  Mrs. Holdsworthy, at Grunton Villa, for I heard him order Jenkins's fly at  that time.'    Caingey Thornton knew exactly when he would find Mr. Waffles at Miss  Lollypop's, the confectioner, eating ices and making love to that very  interesting much-courted young lady. True to his time, there was Waffles,  eating and eyeing the cherry-coloured ribbons, floating in graceful curls  along with her raven-coloured ringlets, down Miss Lollypop's nice fresh  plump cheeks.    After expatiating on the great merits of the horse, and the certainty of  getting all the money back by steeple-chasing him in the spring, and  stating his conviction that Mr. Sponge would not take any part of the  purchase-money in pictures or jewellery, or anything of that sort, Mr.  Waffles gave his consent to deal, on the terms the following conversation  shows.    'My friend will give you your price, if you wouldn't mind taking his cheque  and keeping it for a few months till he's into funds,' observed Mr.  Thornton, who now sought Mr. Sponge out at the billiard-room.    'Why,' observed Mr. Sponge, thoughtfully, 'you know horses are always ready  money.'    'True,' replied Thornton; 'at least that's the theory of the thing; only  my friend is rather peculiarly situated at present.'    'I suppose Mr. Waffles is your man?' observed Mr. Sponge, rightly judging  that there couldn't be two such flats in the place.    'Just so,' said Mr. Thornton.    [Illustration: MR. WAFFLES AT MISS LOLLYPOP'S]    'I'd rather take his \"stiff\" than his cheque,' observed Mr. Sponge, after a  pause. 'I could get a bit of stiff _done_, but a cheque, you  see--especially a post-dated one--is always objected to.'    'Well, I dare say that will make no difference,' observed Mr. Thornton,  '\"stiff,\" if you prefer it--say three months; or perhaps you'll give us  four?'    'Three's long enough, in all conscience,' replied Mr. Sponge, with a shake  of the head, adding, 'Bullfrog made me pay down on the nail.'    'Well, so be it, then,' assented Mr. Thornton; 'you draw at three months,  and Mr. Waffles will accept, payable at Coutts's.'    After so much liberality, Mr. Caingey expected that Mr. Sponge would have  hinted at something handsome for him; but all Sponge said was, 'So be it,'  too, as he walked away to buy a bill-stamp.    Mr. Waffles was more considerate, and promised him the first mount on his  new purchase, though Caingey would rather have had a ten, or even a  five-pound note.    Towards the hour of ten on that eventful day, numerous gaitered, trousered,  and jacketed grooms began to ride up and down the High Street, most of them  with their stirrups crossed negligently on the pommels of the saddles, to  indicate that their masters were going to ride the horses, and not them.  The street grew lively, not so much with people going to hunt, as with  people coming to see those who were. Tattered Hibernians, with rags on  their backs and jokes on their lips; young English _chevaliers  d'industrie_, with their hands ready to dive into anybody's pockets but  their own; stablemen out of place, servants loitering on their errands,  striplings helping them, ladies'-maids with novels or three-corner'd notes,  and a good crop of beggars.    'What, Spareneck, do you ride the grey to-day? I thought you'd done  Gooseman out of a mount,' observed Ensign Downley, as a line of  scarlet-coated youths hung over the balcony of the Imperial Hotel, after  breakfast and before mounting for the day.    Spareneck.--'No, that's for Tuesday. He wouldn't stand one to-day. What do  you ride?'    Downley.--'Oh, I've a hack, one of Screwman's, Perpetual Motion they call  him, because he never gets any rest. That's him, I believe, with the  lofty-actioned hind-legs,' added he, pointing to a weedy string-halty bay  passing below, high in bone and low in flesh.    'Who's o' the gaudy chestnut?' asked Caingey Thornton, who now appeared,  wiping his fat lips after his second glass of _eau de vie_.    'That's Mr. Sponge's,' replied Spareneck in a low tone, knowing how soon a  man catches his own name.    'A deuced fine horse he is, too,' observed Caingey, in a louder key;  adding, 'Sponge has the finest lot of horses of any man in England--in the  world, I may say.'    Mr. Sponge himself now rose from the breakfast table, and was speedily  followed by Mr. Waffles and the rest of the party, some bearing  sofa-pillows and cushions to place on the balustrades, to loll at their  ease, in imitation of the Coventry Club swells in Piccadilly. Then our  friends smoked their cigars, reviewed the cavalry, and criticised the  ladies who passed below in the flys on their way to the meet.    'Come, old Bolter!' exclaimed one, 'here's Miss Bussington coming to look  after you--got her mamma with her, too--so you may as well knock under at  once, for she's determined to have you.'    'A devil of a woman the old un is, too,' observed Ensign Downley; 'she  nearly frightened Jack Simpers of ours into fits, by asking what he meant  after dancing three dances with her daughter one night.'    'My word, but Miss Jumpheavy must expect to do some execution to-day with  that fine floating feather and her crimson satin dress and ermine,'  observed Mr. Waffles, as that estimable lady drove past in her Victoria  phaeton. 'She looks like the Queen of Sheba herself. But come, I suppose,'  he added, taking a most diminutive Geneva watch out of his  waistcoat-pocket, 'we should be going. See! there's your nag kicking up a  shindy,' he said to Caingey Thornton, as the redoubtable brown was led down  the street by a jean-jacketed groom, kicking and lashing out at everything  he came near.    'I'll kick him,' observed Thornton, retiring from the balcony to the  brandy-bottle, and helping himself to a pretty good-sized glass. He then  extricated his large cutting whip from the confusion of whips with which  it was mixed, and clonk, clonk, clonked downstairs to the door.    'Multum in Parvo' stopped the doorway, across whose shoulder Leather passed  the following hints, in a low tone of voice, to Mr. Sponge, as the latter  stood drawing on his dogskin gloves, the observed, as he flattered himself,  of all observers.    'Mind now,' said Leather, 'this oss as a will of his own; though he seems  so quiet like, he's not always to be depended on; so be on the look-out for  squalls.'    Sponge, having had a glass of brandy, just mounted with the air of a man  thoroughly at home with his horse, and drawing the rein, with a slight feel  of the spur, passed on from the door to make way for the redoubtable  Hercules. Hercules was evidently not in a good humour. His ears were laid  back, and the rolling white eye showed mischief. Sponge saw all this, and  turned to see whether Thornton's clumsy, wash-ball seat, would be able to  control the fractious spirit of the horse.    'Whoay!' roared Thornton, as his first dive at the stirrup missed, and was  answered by a hearty kick out from the horse, the 'whoay' being given in a  very different tone to the gentle, coaxing style of Mr. Buckram and his  men. Had it not been for the brandy within and the lookers-on without,  there is no saying but Caingey would have declined the horse's further  acquaintance. As it was, he quickly repeated his attempt at the stirrup  with the same sort of domineering 'whoay,' adding, as he landed in the  saddle and snatched at the reins, 'Do you think I stole you?'    Whatever the horse's opinion might be on that point, he didn't seem to care  to express it, for finding kicking alone wouldn't do, he immediately  commenced rearing too, and by a desperate plunge, broke away from the  groom, before Thornton had either got him by the head or his feet in the  stirrups. Three most desperate bounds he gave, rising at the bit as though  he would come back over if the hold was not relaxed, and the fourth effort  bringing him to the opposite kerb-stone, he up again with such a bound and  impetus that he crashed right through Messrs. Frippery and Flummery's fine  plate-glass window, to the terror and astonishment of their elegant young  counter-skippers, who were busy arranging their ribbons and finery for the  day. Right through the window Hercules went, switching through book muslins  and bareges as he would through a bullfinch, and attempting to make his  exit by a large plate-glass mirror against the wall of the cloak-room  beyond, which he dashed all to pieces with his head. Worse remains to be  told. 'Multum in Parvo,' seeing his old comrade's hind-quarters  disappearing through the window, just took the bit between his teeth, and  followed, in spite of Mr. Sponge's every effort to turn him; and when at  length he got him hauled round, the horse was found to have decorated  himself with a sky-blue _visite_ trimmed with Honiton lace, which he wore  like a charger on his way to the Crusades, or a steed bearing a knight to  the Eglinton tournament.    Quick as it happened, and soon as it was over, all Laverick Wells seemed to  have congregated in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#16)"],[1,"the usual  commission. At first tobacco was the only one of the \"enumerated  articles\" which seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest  coming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,  however, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated  articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,  hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies  were compelled to bring their European purchases back through English  ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants  again.    _The Molasses Act._--Not content with laws enacted in the interest of  English merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the  British West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch  neighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade  with the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar  and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting  on the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,  Parliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on  sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign  countries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the  French and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, were  not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on  merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.    =Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly  of her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the  policy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the  restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be  favorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,  redounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers  of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British  ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors  and in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage  colonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in  the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the  colonists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial  legislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when  free from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves  handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders  and the recipients of bounties in English markets.    Be that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation  against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws  enacted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively  few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those  in farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America  to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of  the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women  and carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was  not the sole support of any considerable number of people.    As a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those  relating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were  boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the  English government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and  molasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New  England in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against  smuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed  in stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of \"the galling  restraints of trade\" until after the French war, when the British  government suddenly entered upon a new course.      SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD    In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,  in 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of  a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent  to take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of  migration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and  nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical  importance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot  were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands  of negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as  domestic servants in the North.    Why did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims  and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and  Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments  that denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of  their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in  the Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the  negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of  adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the  enterprising merchants.    How did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together  and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other  cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it  was the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who  undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their  own way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years  in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account  of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.    Whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get  across the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down  forests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,  schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and  wove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and  traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of  commerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and  Charleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line  they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they  were already on the crest of the Alleghanies.    Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,  the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major  portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the  literature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the  colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a  wilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by  necessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and  later against the French. They were all subjects of the same  sovereign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for  them and the English government supervised their local affairs, their  trade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common  grievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.    Many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw  them into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them  were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled  it with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.  The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the  Church of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each  colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it  grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a  people learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to  strengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of  colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence  which they were designed to quench.    Nevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the  assistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection  of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from  wiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were  controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed  great advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the  earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and  merchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages  which the colonists suffered through British regulation of their  industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.  Still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is  not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A  thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,  to inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a  destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British  empire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that  America would be richer under the British flag, could not change the  spirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George  Washington.      =References=    G.L.
