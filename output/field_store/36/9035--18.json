They appear to live very poorly; go naked; eat yams  and other roots.\"    DAMPIER. 1688.    The buccaneers with whom our celebrated navigator, WILLIAM DAMPIER, made  a voyage round the world, came upon the north-west coast of Terra  Australis, for the purposes of careening their vessel, and procuring  refreshments. They made the land in the latitude of 16 deg. 50', due south  from a shoal whose longitude is now known to be 1221/4 deg. east. From thence,  they ran along the shore, N. E. by E. twelve leagues, to a bay or  opening, where a convenient place was found for their purpose. Dampier's  description of the country and inhabitants of the place, where he  remained from Jan. 5. to March 12., is contained in the account of his  voyages, Vol. I. page 462 to 470; and renders it unnecessary to do more  than to mark its coincidence or disagreement with what is said, in the  above note from Tasman, of the inhabitants and country near the same part  of the coast.    Dampier agrees in the natives being \"a naked, black people, with curly  hair,\" like that of the negroes; but he says they have \"a piece of the  rind of a tree tied like a girdle about their waists, and a handful of  long grass, or three or four green boughs full of leaves, thrust under  their girdle, to cover their nakedness.\" Also, \"that the two fore teeth of  the upper jaw are wanting in all of them, men and women, old and young:  neither have they any beards;\" which circumstances are not mentioned in  the note from Tasman. Dampier did not see either bows or arrows amongst  them; but says, \"the men, at our first coming ashore, threatened us with  their lances and swords; but they were frightened by firing one gun,  which we did purposely to scar them.\" Of \"their prows made of the bark of  trees,\" he saw nothing. On the contrary, he \"espied a drove of these men  swimming from one island to another; for _they have no boats, canoes, or  bark logs_.\" The English navigator is silent as to any dangers upon the  twelve leagues of coast seen by him; but fully agrees in the scarcity of  the vegetable productions, and in the circumstance of the natives using  no houses.    VLAMING. 1696.    The relation of Willem DE VLAMING'S voyage to New Holland was published  at Amsterdam in 1701; but not having been fortunate enough to procure it,  I have had recourse to _Valentyn_, who, in his _Description of Banda_,  has given what appears to be an abridgment of the relation. What follows  is conformable to the sense of the translation which Dr. L. Tiarks had  the goodness to make for me; and the reasons for entering more into the  particulars of this voyage than usual are, the apparent correctness of  the observations, and that no account of them seems to have been  published in the English language.*    [* The Abbe Prevost in his _Hist. gen. des Voyages_, Tome XVI. (a la  Haye) p. 79-81, has given some account of Vlaming's voyage in French; but  the observations on the coast between Shark's Bay and Willem's River are  there wholly omitted.]    A Dutch ship, called the _Ridderschap_, having been missing from the time  she had left the Cape of Good Hope, in 1684 or 1685, it was thought  probable she might have been wrecked upon the GREAT SOUTH LAND, and that  some of the crew might (in 1696) be still living. Accordingly, the  commodore Willem de Vlaming, who was going out to India with the  _Geelvink_, _Nyptang_, and _Wezel_, was ordered to make a search for  them.    On Dec. 28, the ships got soundings in 48 fathoms, coral bottom; in  latitude 31 deg. 53', and longitude 133 deg. 44' (east, apparently, from the Peak  of Teneriffe, 16 deg. 45' to the west of Greenwich); where the variation was  observed to be 10 deg. 28' west: they afterwards had 25 fathoms, on better  ground. On the 29th, they anchored under the island _Rottenest_, which  lies in lat. 31 deg. 50', long. 134 deg. 25';* and next day, a piece of wood,  which had some time been fixed to the deck of a ship, was found upon the  shore; but the nails were then rusted away. Fire wood was abundant here.    [* The account in _Van Keulen_ is somewhat different. He says \"we steered  for the Land of Endragt: and on Dec. 28, got soundings in 63 fathoms,  sandy bottom. The ensuing day we had 30 fathoms, and the coast was then  in sight. The Island Rottenest, in 32 deg. south latitude, was the land we  steered for; and we had from 30 to 10 fathoms, in which last we anchored  on a sandy bottom.\"]    VLAMING. 1697.    Jan. 5. Vlaming went on shore (to the main coast), with eighty-eight  armed men, and walked inland to the eastward. There were a few large, and  some small trees, from which dropped a kind of _gum-lac_; but they found  nothing which could be used as food: the birds were small cockatoos and  green parrots, and both were very shy. At the end of three hours walk  they came to a piece of water, which was salt, and upon the beach were  footsteps of full-grown persons and of children. No men were seen, but  they observed many smokes; and found three deserted huts, so low and  ill-constructed as to be inferior to those of the Hottentots.    On the 6th, they divided themselves into three parties: one took to the  north, another to the south, and the third went four miles east, more  into the interior; but, except one or two decayed huts, they met with  nothing. Being returned to the salt lake without finding fresh water,  they dug a pit near the side of it, and obtained wherewith to relieve  their thirst. The lake had fallen a foot, which showed it to have a  communication with the sea; and they afterwards found the outlet, a  little to the southward. No noxious animal of any kind was seen; and  after remaining on shore all night, they returned on board on the 7th.  The ships were then anchored nearer to the land, with the entrance of the  lake or river bearing S. E. by E. The commodore afterwards went up this  river, to the distance of fourteen or sixteen leagues, and caught some  smelts, as also several black swans, of which two were taken alive to  Batavia.*    [* This appears to be the first mention made of the black swan: the river  was named _Black-Swan River_.]    Having clearly ascertained the latitude (of the ships at anchor, most  probably,) to be 31 deg. 43' south, and discovered a reef four geographic  miles in length, and two miles from the shore, they sailed from thence on  Jan. 13. The wind was from the southward; and whilst the ships steered N.  by W., parallel to the coast, the boats ran along within them, to examine  it more closely. On the 15th, the people from the boats reported that  they had seen neither men nor animals, and very few trees; but had met  with a reef near the shore, in 30 deg. 17'; and many shoals, both under and  above water.    Fires upon the land were seen from all the ships in the night of Jan. 16;  and next day, a boat was sent with armed people; but they returned with  nothing, except some sea-mews which had been caught upon the islands and  shoals lying along the coast. On the 18th, the ships were in latitude 30 deg.  30', and found the variation to be 9 deg. 21' west; and the 20th, some small  islands were seen, and shrubs observed on the main land. On the 23rd,  they were near a steep head, in 28 deg. 8', and sent a boat to the shore; but  the high surf prevented landing. People were perceived walking on the  downs, but at too great a distance to distinguish more than that they  were of the common stature, black, and naked.* The boat got on shore soon  afterward, when some brackish water was found; and having landed again on  the 27th, the people saw some huts, as also the footsteps of men, and  some birds; but there was no other vegetation than small shrubs. Some  very indifferent water was the sole useful thing met with, and it was too  far off for any to be taken on board.    [* It was near this place that captain Pelsert put the two Dutch  conspirators on shore in 1629. Vlaming appears to have passed within  _Houtman's Abrolhos_ without seeing them.]    Jan. 30. The boats were again sent on shore, and discovered two inlets,  of which the southernmost, in latitude 26 deg. 16', was three miles in width.  On Feb. 2, they found two other openings, very deep, one of which ran up  northward, and the other to the east, far inland. They went eleven  leagues up the first of these, and found that it had another  communication with the sea, to the N. N. W.* On the 3rd, a boat brought  the above account; and also, that the chief mate of the Geelvink had  found a plate of tin, with an inscription commemorating the arrival and  departure of _Dirk Hartog_. (See the inscription under the article  Hartog, preceding.) This Road of Dirk Hartog's Bay, where the plate had  been set up, is in 25 deg. 24'; and the west variation was 8 deg. 34'.    [* These two openings, which in the original are called rivers, were  nothing more than the entrance into Shark's Bay. A small island, lying a  little within the entrance, probably made it be taken for two openings.]    No mention is made by Valentyn of the ships entering the road, nor of  their departure from it; but it should seem that they anchored on Feb. 4.  On the 5th, commodore Vlaming and the commander of the Nyptang went with  three boats to the shore, which proved to be an island. They found also a  river, and went up it four or five leagues, amongst rocks "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12956"],[0,"A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1 (#16)"],[1," breathe,  who live, if that bliss had not filled this void (_akas'a_)?

Place of Brahman in the Upani@sads.    There is the atman not in man alone but in all objects of the  universe, the sun, the moon, the world; and Brahman is this atman.  There is nothing outside the atman, and therefore there is no  plurality at all. As from a lump of clay all that is made of clay  is known, as from an ingot of black iron all that is made of  black iron is known, so when this atman the Brahman is known  everything else is known. The essence in man and the essence  of the universe are one and the same, and it is Brahman.    Now a question may arise as to what may be called the nature  of the phenomenal world of colour, sound, taste, and smell. But  we must also remember that the Upani@sads do not represent so  much a conceptional system of philosophy as visions of the seers  who are possessed by the spirit of this Brahman. They do not  notice even the contradiction between the Brahman as unity and  nature in its diversity. When the empirical aspect of diversity  attracts their notice, they affirm it and yet declare that it is all  Brahman. From Brahman it has come forth and to it will it  return. He has himself created it out of himself and then entered  into it as its inner controller (_antaryamin_). Here is thus a glaring  dualistic trait of the world of matter and Brahman as its controller,  though in other places we find it asserted most emphatically that  these are but names and forms, and when Brahman is known  everything else is known. No attempts at reconciliation are made  for the sake of the consistency of conceptual utterance, as  S'a@nkara the great professor of Vedanta does by explaining away  the dualistic texts. The universe is said to be a reality, but the  real in it is Brahman alone. It is on account of Brahman that  the fire burns and the wind blows. He is the active principle in  the entire universe, and yet the most passive and unmoved. The    49    world is his body, yet he is the soul within. \"He creates all,  wills all, smells all, tastes all, he has pervaded all, silent and  unaffected [Footnote ref 1].\" He is below, above, in the back, in front,  in the south and in the north, he is all this [Footnote ref 2].\" These  rivers in the east and in the west originating from the ocean, return  back into it and become the ocean themselves, though they do not know  that they are so. So also all these people coming into being from the  Being do not know that they have come from the Being...That which  is the subtlest that is the self, that is all this, the truth, that self  thou art O S'vetaketu [Footnote ref 3].\" \"Brahman,\" as Deussen points out,  \"was regarded as the cause antecedent in time, and the universe  as the effect proceeding from it; the inner dependence of the  universe on Brahman and its essential identity with him was  represented as a creation of the universe by and out of Brahman.\"  Thus it is said in Mund. I.I. 7:      As a spider ejects and retracts (the threads),    As the plants shoot forth on the earth,    As the hairs on the head and body of the living man,    So from the imperishable all that is here.    As the sparks from the well-kindled fire,    In nature akin to it, spring forth in their thousands,    So, my dear sir, from the imperishable    Living beings of many kinds go forth,    And again return into him [Footnote ref 4].    Yet this world principle is the dearest to us and the highest  teaching of the Upani@sads is \"That art thou.\"    Again the growth of the doctrine that Brahman is the \"inner  controller\" in all the parts and forces of nature and of mankind as  the atman thereof, and that all the effects of the universe are the  result of his commands which no one can outstep, gave rise to a  theistic current of thought in which Brahman is held as standing  aloof as God and controlling the world. It is by his ordaining, it  is said, that the sun and moon are held together, and the sky and  earth stand held together [Footnote ref 5]. God and soul are distinguished  again in the famous verse of S'vetas'vatara [Footnote ref 6]:      Two bright-feathered bosom friends    Flit around one and the same tree;    One of them tastes the sweet berries,    The other without eating merely gazes down.    ______________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Cha. III. 14. 4.]    [Footnote 2: _Ibid._ VII. 25. i; also Mu@n@daka II. 2. ii.]    [Footnote 3: Cha. VI. 10.]    [Footnote 4: Deussen's translation in _Philosophy of the Upanishads_, p.  164.]    [Footnote 5: B@rh. III. 8. i.]    [Footnote 6: S'vetas'vatara IV. 6, and Mu@n@daka III. i, 1, also Deussen's  translation in _Philosophy of the Upanishads_, p. 177.]    50    But in spite of this apparent theistic tendency and the occasional  use of the word _Is'a_ or _Is'ana_, there seems to be no doubt  that theism in its true sense was never prominent, and this acknowledgement  of a supreme Lord was also an offshoot of the exalted  position of the atman as the supreme principle. Thus we read in  Kau@sitaki Upani@sad 3. 9, \"He is not great by good deeds nor low  by evil deeds, but it is he makes one do good deeds whom he  wants to raise, and makes him commit bad deeds whom he wants  to lower down. He is the protector of the universe, he is the  master of the world and the lord of all; he is my soul (_atman_).\"  Thus the lord in spite of his greatness is still my soul. There are  again other passages which regard Brahman as being at once  immanent and transcendent. Thus it is said that there is that  eternally existing tree whose roots grow upward and whose  branches grow downward. All the universes are supported in it  and no one can transcend it. This is that, \"...from its fear the fire  burns, the sun shines, and from its fear Indra, Vayu and Death  the fifth (with the other two) run on [Footnote ref 1].\"    If we overlook the different shades in the development of the  conception of Brahman in the Upani@sads and look to the main  currents, we find that the strongest current of thought which has  found expression in the majority of the texts is this that the  Atman or the Brahman is the only reality and that besides this  everything else is unreal. The other current of thought which is  to be found in many of the texts is the pantheistic creed that  identifies the universe with the Atman or Brahman. The third  current is that of theism which looks upon Brahman as the Lord  controlling the world. It is because these ideas were still in the  melting pot, in which none of them were systematically worked  out, that the later exponents of Vedanta, S'a@nkara, Ramanuja,  and others quarrelled over the meanings of texts in order to  develop a consistent systematic philosophy out of them. Thus it  is that the doctrine of Maya which is slightly hinted at once in  B@rhadara@nyaka and thrice in S'vetas'vatara, becomes the foundation  of S'a@nkara's philosophy of the Vedanta in which Brahman  alone is real and all else beside him is unreal [Footnote ref 2].    _________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Ka@tha II. 6. 1 and 3.]    [Footnote 2: B@rh. II. 5. 19, S'vet. I. 10, IV. 9, 10.]    51      The World.    We have already seen that the universe has come out of  Brahman, has its essence in Brahman, and will also return back  to it. But in spite of its existence as Brahman its character as  represented to experience could not be denied. S'a@nkara held  that the Upani@sads referred to the external world and accorded  a reality to it consciously with the purpose of treating it as merely  relatively real, which will eventually appear as unreal as soon  as the ultimate truth, the Brahman, is known. This however  remains to be modified to this extent that the sages had not  probably any conscious purpose of according a relative reality to  the phenomenal world, but in spite of regarding Brahman as the  highest reality they could not ignore the claims of the exterior  world, and had to accord a reality to it. The inconsistency of this  reality of the phenomenal world with the ultimate and only  reality of Brahman was attempted to be reconciled by holding  that this world is not beside him but it has come out of him, it  is maintained in him and it will return back to him.    The world is sometimes spoken of in its twofold aspect, the  organic and the inorganic. All organic things, whether plants,  animals or men, have souls [Footnote ref 1]. Brahman desiring to be many  created fire (_tejas_), water (_ap_) and earth (_k@siti_). Then the  self-existent Brahman entered into these three, and it is by their  combination that all other bodies are formed [Footnote ref 2]. So all  other things are produced as a result of an alloying or compounding  of the parts of these three together. In this theory of the threefold  division of the primitive elements lies the earliest germ of the later  distinction (especially in the Sa@mkhya school) of pure infinitesimal  substances (_tanmatra_) and gross elements, and the theory that each  gross substance is composed of the atoms of the primary elements. And  in Pras'na IV. 8 we find the gross elements distinguished from their  subtler natures, e.g. earth (_p@rthivi_), and the subtler state of earth  (_p@rthivimatra_). In the Taittiriya, II. 1, however, ether (_akas'a_)  is also described as proceeding from Brahman, and the other elements,  air, fire, water, and earth, are described as each proceeding  directly from the one which directly preceded it.    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Cha.
