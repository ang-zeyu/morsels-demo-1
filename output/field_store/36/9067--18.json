Primitive dancing differs very widely from      that civilized kind of dancing--finding its extreme type in the      ballet--in which energy is concentrated into the muscles below      the knee. In the finest kinds of primitive dancing all the limbs,      the whole body, take part. For instance, \"the Marquisan girls,\"      Herman Melville remarked in _Typee_, \"dance all over, as it were;      not only do their feet dance, but their arms, hands,      fingers,--ay, their very eyes seem to dance in their heads. In      good sooth, they so sway their floating forms, arch their necks,      toss aloft their naked arms, and glide, and swim, and whirl,\"      etc.        If we turn to a very different people, we find this      characteristic of primitive dancing admirably illustrated by the      missionary, Holden, in the case of Kaffir dances. \"So far as I      have observed,\" he states, \"the perfection of the art or science      consists in their _being able to put every part of the body into      motion at the same time_. And as they are naked, the bystander      has a good opportunity of observing the whole process, which      presents a remarkably odd and grotesque appearance,--the head,      the trunk, the arms, the legs, the hands, the feet, bones,      muscles, sinews, skin, scalp, and hair, each and all in motion at      the same time, with feathers waving, tails of monkeys and wild      beasts dangling, and shields beating, accompanied with whistling,      shouting, and leaping. It would appear as though the whole frame      was hung on springing wires or cords. Dances are held in high      repute, being the natural expression of joyous emotion, or      creating it when absent. There is, perhaps, no exercise in      greater accordance with the sentiments or feelings of a barbarous      people, or more fully calculated to gratify their wild and      ungoverned passions.\" (W.C. Holden, _The Kaffir Race_, 1866, p.      274.)    Dancing, as the highest and most complex form of muscular movement, is the  most potent method of obtaining the organic excitement muscular movement  yields, and thus we understand how from the earliest zooelogical ages it  has been brought to the service of the sexual instinct as a mode of  attaining tumescence. Among savages this use of dancing works harmoniously  with the various other uses which dancing possesses in primitive times  and which cause it to occupy so large and vital a part in savage life that  it may possibly even affect the organism to such an extent as to mold the  bones; so that some authorities have associated platycnemia with dancing.  As civilization advances, the other uses of dancing fall away, but it  still remains a sexual stimulant. Burton, in his _Anatomy of Melancholy_,  brings forward a number of quotations from old authors showing that  dancing is an incitement to love.[41]        The Catholic theologians (Debreyne, _Moechialogie_, pp. 190-199)      for the most part condemn dancing with much severity. In      Protestant Germany, also, it is held that dance meetings and      musical gatherings are frequent occasions of unchastity. Thus in      the Leipzig district when a girl is asked \"How did you fall?\" she      nearly always replies \"At the dance.\" (_Die      Geschlechtlich-Sittliche Verhaeltnisse im Deutschen Reiche_, vol.      i, p. 196.) It leads quite as often, and no doubt oftener, to      marriage. Rousseau defended it on this account (_Nouvelle      Heloise_, bk. iv, letter x); dancing is, he held, an admirable      preliminary to courtship, and the best way for young people to      reveal themselves to each other, in their grace and decorum,      their qualities and defects, while its publicity is its      safeguard. An International Congress of Dancing Masters was held      at Barcelona in 1907. In connection with this Congress, Giraudet,      president of the International Academy of Dancing Masters, issued      an inquiry to over 3000 teachers of dancing throughout the world      in order to ascertain the frequency with which dancing led to      marriage. Of over one million pupils of dancing, either married      or engaged to be married, it was found that in most countries      more than 50 per cent. met their conjugal partners at dances. The      smallest proportion was in Norway, with only 39 per cent., and      the highest, Germany, with 97 per cent. Intermediate are France,      83 per cent.; America, 80 per cent.; Italy, 70 per cent.; Spain,      68 per cent.; Holland, Bulgaria, and England, 65 per cent.;      Australia and Roumania, 60 per cent., etc. Of the teachers      themselves 92 per cent. met their partners at dances. (Quoted      from the _Figaro_ in Beiblatt \"Sexualreform\" to _Geschlecht und      Gesellschaft_, 1907, p. 175.)    In civilization, however, dancing is not only an incitement to love and a  preliminary to courtship, but it is often a substitute for the normal  gratification of the sexual instinct, procuring something of the pleasure  and relief of gratified love. In occasional abnormal cases this may be  consciously realized. Thus Sadger, who regards the joy of dancing as a  manifestation of \"muscular eroticism,\" gives the case of a married  hysterical woman of 21, with genital anesthesia, but otherwise strongly  developed skin eroticism, who was a passionate dancer: \"I often felt as  though I was giving myself to my partner in dancing,\" she said, \"and was  actually having coitus with him. I have the feeling that in me dancing  takes the place of coitus.\"[42] Normally something of the same feeling is  experienced by many young women, who will expend a prodigious amount of  energy in dancing, thus procuring, not fatigue, but happiness and  relief.[43] It is significant that, after sexual relations have begun,  girls generally lose much of their ardor in dancing. Even our modern  dances, it is worthy of note, are often of sexual origin; thus, the most  typical of all, the waltz, was originally (as Schaller, quoted by Groos,  states) the close of a complicated dance which \"represented the romance of  love, the seeking and the fleeing, the playful sulking and shunning, and  finally the jubilation of the wedding.\"[44]    Not only is movement itself a source of tumescence, but even the spectacle  of movement tends to produce the same effect. The pleasure of witnessing  movement, as represented by its stimulating effect on the muscular  system,--for states of well-being are accompanied by an increase of  power,--has been found susceptible of exact measurement by Fere. He has  shown that to watch a colored disk when in motion produced stronger  muscular contractions, as measured by the dynamometer, than to watch the  same disk when motionless. Even in the absence of color a similar  influence of movement was noted, and watching a modified metronome  produced a greater increase of work with the ergograph than when working  to the rhythm of the metronome without watching it.[45] This psychological  fact has been independently discovered by advertisers, who seek to impress  the value of their wares on the public by the device of announcing them by  moving colored lights. The pleasure given by the ballet largely depends on  the same fact. Not only is dancing an excitation, but the spectacle of  dancing is itself exciting, and even among savages dances have a public  which becomes almost as passionately excited as the dancers  themselves.[46] It is in virtue of this effect of dancing and similar  movements that we so frequently find, both among the lower animals and  savage man, that to obtain tumescence in both sexes, it is sufficient for  one sex alone, usually the male, to take the active part. This point  attracted the attention of Kulischer many years ago, and he showed how the  dances of the men, among savages, excite the women, who watch them  intently though unobtrusively, and are thus influenced in choosing their  lovers. He was probably the first to insist that in man sexual selection  has taken place mainly through the agency of dances, games, and  festivals.[47]    It is now clear, therefore, why the evacuation theory of the sexual  impulse must necessarily be partial and inadequate. It leaves out of  account the whole of the phenomena connected with tumescence, and those  phenomena constitute the most prolonged, the most important, the most  significant stage of the sexual process. It is during tumescence that the  whole psychology of the sexual impulse is built up; it is as an incident  arising during tumescence and influencing its course that we must probably  regard nearly every sexual aberration. It is with the second stage of the  sexual process, when the instinct of detumescence arises, that the analogy  of evacuation can alone be called in. Even here, that analogy, though  real, is not complete, the nervous element involved in detumescence being  out of all proportion to the extent of the evacuation. The typical act of  evacuation, however, is a nervous process, and when we bear this in mind  we may see whatever truth the evacuation theory possesses. Beaunis classes  the sexual impulse with the \"needs of activity,\" but under this head he  coordinates it with the \"need of urination.\" That is to say, that both  alike are nervous explosions. Micturition, like detumescence, is a  convulsive act, and, like detumescence also, it is certainly connected  with cerebral processes; thus in epilepsy the passage of urine which may  occur (as in a girl described by Gowers with minor attacks during which it  was emitted consciously, but involuntarily) is really a part of the  process.[48]    There appears, indeed, to be a special and intimate connection between the  explosion of sexual detumescence and the explosive energy of the bladder;  so that they may reinforce each other and to a limited extent act  vicariously in relieving each other's tension. It is noteworthy that  nocturnal and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13613"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 4 (#16)"],[1,"all, or nearly all, at pleasure. In some persons there      is no necessary accompanying revival of visual or tactile      representations, but in the majority the revived odor ultimately      excites a corresponding visual image. The odors most frequently      recalled were pinks, musk, violets, heliotrope, carbolic acid,      the smell of the country, of grass, etc. Pieron (_Revue      Philosophique_, December, 1902) has described the special power      possessed by vague odors, in his own case, of evoking ancient      impressions.        Dr. J.N. Mackenzie (_American Journal of the Medical Sciences_,      January, 1886) considers that civilization exerts an influence in      heightening or encouraging the influence of olfaction as it      affects our emotions and judgment, and that, in the same way, as      we ascend the social scale the more readily our minds are      influenced and perhaps perverted by impressions received through      the sense of smell.    Odors are powerful stimulants to the whole nervous system, causing, like  other stimulants, an increase of energy which, if excessive or prolonged,  leads to nervous exhaustion. Thus, it is well recognized in medicine that  the aromatics containing volatile oils (such as anise, cinnamon,  cardamoms, cloves, coriander, and peppermint) are antispasmodics and  anaesthetics, and that they stimulate digestion, circulation, and the  nervous system, in large doses producing depression. The carefully  arranged plethysmographic experiments of Shields, at the Johns Hopkins  University, have shown that olfactory sensations, by their action on the  vasomotor system, cause an increase of blood in the brain and sometimes in  addition stimulation of the heart; musk, wintergreen, wood violet, and  especially heliotrope were found to act strongly in these ways.[27]    Fere's experiments with the dynamometer and the ergograph have greatly  contributed to illustrate the stimulating effects of odors. Thus, he found  that smelling musk suffices to double muscular effort. With a number of  odorous substances he has found that muscular work is temporarily  heightened; when taste stimulation was added the increase of energy,  notably when using lemon was \"colossal.\" A kind of \"sensorial  intoxication\" could be produced by the inhalation of odors and the whole  system stimulated to greater activity; the visual acuity was increased,  and electric and general excitability heightened.[28] Such effects may be  obtained in perfectly healthy persons, though both Shields and Fere have  found that in highly nervous persons the effects are liable to be much  greater. It is doubtless on this account that it is among civilized  peoples that attention is chiefly directed to perfumes, and that under the  conditions of modern life the interest in olfaction and its study has been  revived.    It is the genuinely stimulant qualities of odorous substances which led to  the widespread use of the more potent among them by ancient physicians,  and has led a few modern physicians to employ them still. Thus, vanilla,  according to Eloy, deserves to be much more frequently used  therapeutically than it is, on account of its excitomotor properties; he  states that its qualities as an excitant of sexual desire have long been  recognized and that Fonssagrives used to prescribe it for sexual  frigidity.[29]      FOOTNOTES:    [26] The opinions of psychologists concerning the aesthetic significance of  smell, not on the whole very favorable, are brought together and discussed  by J.V.

In approaching the specifically sexual aspect of odor in the human species  we may start from the fundamental fact--a fact we seek so far as possible  to disguise in our ordinary social relations--that all men and women are  odorous. This is marked among all races. The powerful odor of many, though  not all, negroes is well known; it is by no means due to uncleanly habits,  and Joest remarks that it is even increased by cleanliness, which opens  the pores of the skin; according to Sir H. Johnston, it is most marked in  the armpits and is stronger in men than in women. Pruner Bey describes it  as \"ammoniacal and rancid; it is like the odor of the he-goat.\" The odor  varies not only individually, but according to the tribe; Castellani  states that the negress of the Congo has merely a slight \"_gout de  noisette_\" which is agreeable rather than otherwise. Monbuttu women,  according to Parke, have a strong Gorgonzola perfume, and Emin told Parke  that he could distinguish the members of different tribes by their  characteristic odor. In the same way the Nicobarese, according to Man, can  distinguish a member of each of the six tribes of the archipelago by  smell. The odor of Australian blacks is less strong than that of negroes  and has been described as of a phosphoric character. The South American  Indians, d'Orbigny stated, have an odor stronger than that of Europeans,  though not as strong as most negroes; it is marked, Latcham states, even  among those who, like the Araucanos, bathe constantly. The Chinese have a  musky odor. The odor of many peoples is described as being of garlic.[30]    A South Sea Islander, we are told by Charles de Varigny, on coming to  Sydney and seeing the ladies walking about the streets and apparently  doing nothing, expressed much astonishment, adding, with a gesture of  contempt, \"and they have no smell!\" It is by no means true, however, that  Europeans are odorless. They are, indeed, considerably more odorous than  are many other races,--for instance, the Japanese,--and there is doubtless  some association between the greater hairiness of Europeans and their  marked odor, since the sebaceous glands are part of the hair apparatus. A  Japanese anthropologist, Adachi, has published an interesting study on the  odor of Europeans,[31] which he describes as a strong and pungent  smell,--sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter,--of varying strength in  different individuals, absent in children and the aged, and having its  chief focus in the armpits, which, however carefully they are washed,  immediately become odorous again. Adachi has found that the sweat-glands  are larger in Europeans than in the Japanese, among whom a strong personal  odor is so uncommon that \"armpit stink\" is a disqualification for the  army. It is certainly true that the white races smell less strongly than  most of the dark races, odor seeming to be correlated to some extent with  intensity of pigmentation, as well as with hairiness; but even the most  scrupulously clean Europeans all smell. This fact may not always be  obvious to human nostrils, apart from intimate contact, but it is well  known to dogs, to whom their masters are recognizable by smell. When Hue  traveled in Tibet in Chinese disguise he was not detected by the natives,  but the dogs recognized him as a foreigner by his smell and barked at him.  Many Chinese can tell by smell when a European has been in a room.[32]  There are, however, some Europeans who can recognize and distinguish their  friends by smell. The case has been recorded of a man who with bandaged  eyes could recognize his acquaintances, at the distance of several paces,  the moment they entered the room. In another case a deaf and blind mute  woman in Massachusetts knew all her acquaintances by smell, and could sort  linen after it came from the wash by the odor alone. Governesses have been  known to be able when blindfolded to recognize the ownership of their  pupil's garments by smell; such a case is known to me. Such odor is  usually described as being agreeable, but not one person in fifty, it is  stated, is able to distinguish it with sufficient precision to use it as a  method of recognition. Among some races, however this aptitude would  appear to be better developed. Dr. C.S. Myers at Sarawak noted that his  Malay boy sorted the clean linen according to the skin-odor of the  wearer.[33] Chinese servants are said to do the same, as well as  "]]]
