The world, as he sees it around him, is almost unconscious of its  unspeakable loveliness and mystery; and it is largely regimented and  organized for absurdity. The greater part of the movement he sees is  (by his standard) not merely stupid (which is pardonable and  appealing), but meaningless altogether. He views it between anger  and tenderness. Where there might have been the exquisite and  delicious simplicity of a Japanese print, he sees the flicker and  cruel garishness of a speeding film. And so, for refreshment, he  crosses through the invisible doorway into his own dear land of  lucidity. He cons over that passport of his unsociability, words of  J.B. Yeats which should be unforgotten in every poet's mind:         Poetry is the voice of the solitary man. The poet is always a       solitary; and yet he speaks to others--he would win their       attention. Thus it follows that every poem is a social act done       by a solitary man. And being an alien from the strange land of       the solitary, he cannot be expected to admonish or to       sermonize, or uplift, as it is called; and so take part in the       cabals and intrigues in other lands of which he knows nothing,       being himself a stranger from a strange land, the land of the       solitary. People listen to him as they would to any other       traveller come from distant countries, and all he asks for is       courtesy even as he himself is courteous.         Inferior poets are those who forget their dignity--and, indeed,       their only chance of being permitted to live--and to make       friends try to enter into the lives of the people whom they       would propitiate, and so become teachers and moralists and       preachers. And soon for penalty of their rashness and folly       they forget their own land of the solitary, and its speech       perishes from their lips. The traveller's tales are of all the       most precious, because he comes from a land--the poet's       solitude--which no other feet have trodden and which no other       feet will tread.    So, briefly and awkwardly, he justifies himself, being given (as  Mrs. Quickly apologized) to \"allicholy and musing.\" Oh, it is not  easy! As Gilbert Chesterton said, in a noble poem:              The way is all so very plain              That we may lose the way.            [Illustration]        1100 WORDS      The managing editor, the city editor, the production manager, the  foreman of the composing room, and the leading editorial writer  having all said to us with a great deal of sternness, \"Your copy for  Saturday has got to be upstairs by such and such a time, because we  are going to make up the page at so and so A.M.,\" we got rather  nervous.    If we may say so, we did not like the way they said it. They  spoke--and we are thinking particularly of the production  manager--with a kind of paternal severity that was deeply  distressing to our spirit. They are all, in off hours, men of  delightfully easy disposition. They are men with whom it would be a  pleasure and a privilege to be cast away on a desert island or in a  crowded subway train. It is only just to say that they are men whom  we admire greatly. When we meet them in the elevator, or see them at  Frank's having lunch, how full of jolly intercourse they are. But in  the conduct of their passionate and perilous business, that is, of  getting the paper out on time, a holy anguish shines upon their  brows. The stern daughter of the voice of God has whispered to them,  and they pass on the whisper to us through a mega-phone.    That means to say that within the hour we have got to show up  something in the neighbourhood of 1100 words to these magistrates  and overseers. With these keys--typewriter keys, of course--we have  got to unlock our heart. Milton, thou shouldst be living at this  hour. Speaking of Milton, the damp that fell round his path (in  Wordsworth's sonnet) was nothing to the damp that fell round our  alert vestiges as we hastened to the Salamis station in that drench  this morning. (We ask you to observe our self-restraint. We might  have said \"drenching downpour of silver Long Island rain,\" or  something of that sort, and thus got several words nearer our  necessary total of 1100. But we scorn, even when writing against  time, to take petty advantages. Let us be brief, crisp, packed with  thought. Let it stand as drench, while you admire our proud  conscience.)    Eleven hundred words--what a lot could be said in 1100 words! We  stood at the front door of the baggage car (there is an odd irony in  this: the leading editorial writer, one of the most implacable of  our taskmasters, is spending the summer at Sea Cliff, and he gets  the last empty seat left in the smoker. So we, getting on at  Salamis, have to stand in the baggage car) watching the engine rock  and roar along the rails, while the rain sheeted the level green  fields. It is very agreeable to ride on a train in the rain. We have  never known just why, but it conduces to thought. The clear trickles  of water are drawn slantwise across the window panes, and one  watches, absently, the curious behaviour of the drops. They hang  bulging and pendulous, in one spot for some seconds. Then, as they  swell, suddenly they break loose and zigzag swiftly down the pane,  following the slippery pathway that previous drops have made. It is  like a little puzzle game where you manoeuvre a weighted capsule  among pegs toward a narrow opening. \"Pigs in clover,\" they sometimes  call it, but who knows why? The conduct of raindrops on a  smoking-car window is capricious and odd, but we must pass on. That  topic alone would serve for several hundred words, but we will not  be opportunist.    We stood at the front door of the baggage car, and in a pleasant  haze of the faculties we thought of a number of things. We thought  of some books we had seen up on East Fifty-ninth Street, in that  admirable row of old bookshops, particularly Mowry Saben's volume of  essays, \"The Spirit of Life,\" which we are going back to buy one of  these days; so please let it alone. We then got out a small  note-book in which we keep memoranda of books we intend to read and  pored over it zealously. Just for fun, we will tell you three of  the titles we have noted there:         \"The Voyage of the Hoppergrass,\" by E.L. Pearson.       \"People and Problems,\" by Fabian Franklin.       \"Broken Stowage,\" by David W. Bone.    But most of all we thought, in a vague sentimental way, about that  pleasant Long Island country through which the engine was haling and  hallooing all those carloads of audacious commuters.    Only the other day we heard a wise man say that he did not care for  Long Island, because one has to travel through a number of  half-built suburbs before getting into real country. We felt, when  he said it, that it would be impossible for us to tell him how much  some of those growing suburbs mean to us, for we have lived in them.  There is not one of those little frame dwellings that doesn't give  us a thrill as we buzz past them. If you voyage from Brooklyn, as we  do, you will have noticed two stations (near Jamaica) called  Clarenceville and Morris Park. Now we have never got off at those  stations, though we intend to some day. But in those rows of small  houses and in sudden glimpses of modest tree-lined streets and  corner drug stores we can see something that we are not subtle  enough to express. We see it again in the scrap of green park by the  station at Queens, and in the brave little public library near the  same station--which we cannot see from the train, though we often  try to; but we know it is there, and probably the same kindly lady  librarian and the children borrowing books. We see it again--or we  did the other day--in a field at Mineola where a number of small  boys were flying kites in the warm, clean, softly perfumed air of a  July afternoon. We see it in the vivid rows of colour in the  florist's meadow at Floral Park. We don't know just what it is, but  over all that broad tract of hardworking suburbs there is a secret  spirit of practical and persevering decency that we somehow  associate with the soul of America.    We see it with the eye of a lover, and we know that it is good.    Having got as far as this, we took the trouble to count all the  words up to this point. The total is exactly 1100.            [Illustration]        SOME INNS      The other evening we went with Titania to a ramshackle country hotel  which calls itself _The Mansion House_, looking forward to a fine  robust meal. It was a transparent, sunny, cool evening, and when we  saw on the bill of fare _half broiled chicken_, we innocently  supposed that the word _half_ was an adjective modifying the  compound noun, _broiled-chicken_. Instead, to our sorrow and  disappointment, it proved to be an adverb modifying _broiled_ (we  hope we parse the matter correctly). At any rate, the wretched fowl  was blue and pallid, a little smoked on the exterior, raw and sinewy  within, and an affront to the whole profession of innkeeping.  Whereupon, in the days that followed, looking back at our fine mood  of expectancy as we entered that hostelry, and its pitiable collapse  when the miserable travesty of victuals was laid before us, we fell  to thinking about some of the inns we had known of old time where  we had feasted not without good heart.    To speak merely by sudden memory, for instance, there was the fine  old hotel in Burlington, Vermont--is it called the _Van Ness  House_?--where we remember a line of cane-bottomed chairs on a long  shady veranda, where one could look out and see the town simmering  in that waft of hot and dazzling sunshine that pours across Lake  Champlain in the late afternoon: and _The Black Lion_, Lavenham,  Suffolk; where (unless we confuse it with a pub in Bury St. Edmunds  where we had lunch), there was, in the hallway, a very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15795"],[0,"The Rover Boys in Camp; or, The Rivals of Pine Island (#16)"],[1,"to kill me alretty, drowing me  aroundt like a log of vood, hey\"?    There was no answer, and now he looked at the cadets, to discover that  each wore a black mask, with a hood from which two black horns  protruded.    \"Who you vos alretty\"? he spluttered, staring in open-mouthed amazement  at the party. \"You vos all look like der Oldt Boy, ain't it! I guess I  go me back to der camp kvick!\" and he started to run.    Hans did not get far, for a foot send him sprawling, and by the time he  was again on his feet four masked cadets had him by the hands and arms,  so that he could not get away. He started to yell when of a sudden  somebody threw a handful of dry flour into his wide open mouth.    \"Wuog!\" he gasped. \"Wuog! Do--you--wants--to choke me alretty!\" And  then he started to sneeze, as some of the flour entered his nose.    There was a moment of silence and then one of the masked figures  advanced slowly.    \"Hans Mueller, are you prepared to meet your doom\"? was the question  put, in a deep bass voice.    \"Doom? Vot's dot?\" asked the German boy, slightly frightened.    \"Are you prepared to die?\"    \"Die? Not by a jugful I ain't. You let me go!\"    \"Are you prepared to become a full-fledged member of the Order of Black  Skulls.\"    \"Not much, I ton't belong to noddings,\" gasped Hans.    \"Then you must prepare to meet your fate. Away with him, fellows, to  his doom!\"    Before Hans could resist he was caught up once again. One of the cadets  had brought with him a large blanket and into this the German youth was  thrown. Then the others caught the blanket around the edges.    \"Stop!\" roared Hans, and tried to climb out of the blanket. But before  he could manage it, the thing was given a toss and up he went, high  into the air.    \"Oh! Mine cracious!\" he gasped and came down with a crash, to go up  again an instant later. Then up and down went the boy, turning over and  over, until he was all but dazed.    \"Stop! Murder! Fire! Robbers!\" he roared. \"Let me owid, kvick! I vos  turning outsides in alretty! Oh, stop, von't you, blease!\"    \"Will you join the Order of Black Skulls\"? he was asked again.    \"_Yah, yah!_ Anydings, so long as you lets me town kvick!\"    \"And you will not breathe a word about what has taken place here\"?    \"I say me noddings, upon my honor, ain't it!\"    \"Then let him go, fellows,\" and a moment later Hans was lowered.    \"Now you are one of us,\" said another student, and handed him a mask,  skull-cap and pair of horns, the latter made of stuffed black cloth.  \"Do you promise to help us\"?    \"Anydings vot you vonts.\"    \"Then come with us, and don't dare to open your mouth.\"          CHAPTER XVIII    HAZERS AT WORK      William Philander Tubbs was dreaming of a fashionable dance he had once  enjoyed when he suddenly found himself bound and gagged and being  carried he knew not where.    \"This is awful!\" he thought. \"What in the world does it mean?\"    Then he remembered that some of the cadets had spoken about hazing, and  the cold perspiration came out on his forehead.    The gag in his mouth was made of nothing more than a knot in a clean  towel, but it worried him a good deal and he was afraid he would be  choked to death by it. But nothing of the sort happened, and soon the  gag was removed.    \"What does this mean?\" he asked, as many cadets had done before him.    He received no answer, and tried to break away from his tormentors. But  their hold on him could not be shaken, and before he was set down he  found himself well out of sight and hearing of Camp Putnam, as the spot  had been named.    \"This is a beastly shame,\" he murmured. \"Why do you dare to break into  my night's rest in this fashion?\"    He had heard of the mysterious society of Black Skulls before, but so  far had never been hazed by the members. He looked curiously at the  masked cadets, wondering if he could recognize any of them.    \"Are you prepared to meet your doom?\" he was asked.    \"I am prepared to go back to my tent,\" he answered.    \"Away with him!\" was the cry.    \"Where are you going to take me?\" he asked anxiously.    There was no reply, but in a twinkling his hands were caught and bound  tightly behind him, and a bag was thrust over his head and fastened  around his throat. The bag was so thick that he could not see a thing  before him.    \"Let him take the cold water cure,\" said a voice, and he was forced to  move forward.    \"It's rather deep there,\" whispered a voice, just loud enough for him  to hear.    \"Not over his waist,\" whispered another voice.    \"What! It's twice over his head,\" was the answer. \"I tested the water  this afternoon.\"    \"Never mind, he's got to take the test anyway.\"    Now Tubbs was by no means a good swimmer, and the idea of being thrown  into the water with his hands tied behind him and his head in a sack  was frightful in the extreme.    \"Le--let me go!\" he whined. \"Let me go, I say!\"    \"Forward with him!\" was the heartless reply, and he was pushed on until  he suddenly found himself in water up to his ankles.    \"Stop! stop!\" he cried, in a muffled voice. \"Stop! I don't want to  drown!\"    \"Will you obey your superiors?\"    \"Yes, yes--anything!\"    \"Will you join the Order of Black Skulls?\"    \"Anything, I told you, only don't let me drown!\" cried the frightened  William Philander.    \"And will you promise to keep mum about what has happened here  to-night?\"    \"Yes, yes!\"    \"Very well, you shall not be allowed to drown. But you must take the  plunge.\"    \"Oh, dear me! I can't--\"    \"Forward, and be lively about it. We will fish you out with a crab  net.\"    \"But I--I can't swim with my hands tied behind me!\" chattered poor  Tubbs.    \"Yes, you can. Forward now! Ha, fellows, he will not go. Jab him with  the pitchfork!\"    At this a student stepped behind Tubbs and pricked his back with a pin.    The fashionable youth let out a yell of terror, and then, certain that  he was about to take an awful plunge into some deep part of the lake,  made a desperate leap forward.    A wild shriek of laughter rang out as Tubbs made the leap. He had  jumped across a narrow brook not six inches deep and landed sprawling  on the grass beyond.    \"You are now initiated,\" said one of the masked cadets, when the  laughter had somewhat died away. And at once Tubbs' hands were untied  and the bag was taken from his head.    \"Well, I never!\" he murmured, as he gazed in amazement at the brook.  \"Thought it was the lake front sure!\"    \"As you are now one of us, Tubbs, you must wear these,\" said a cadet,  and furnished the fashionable youth with a mask, cap, and pair of  horns.    \"We have now disposed of number two,\" said another cadet. \"What of  number three?\"    \"Number three must--\"    At that moment a gun-shot rang out on the still night air.    \"Hullo, something is wrong!\" cried one of the hazers, in quick alarm.    \"There goes the drum, fellows!\" came in the unmistakable voice of Sam  Rover. \"We've got to hustle back to camp or we'll be exposed!\"    \"Right you are,\" came from Songbird Powell. \"Come, fellows, and mind  you don't let anybody see the masks and other things.\"    And away they scooted, under the trees and then along a row of bushes  running fairly close to the first line of tents. In the meantime the  drum continued to roll and the whole camp was astir. Captain Putnam  himself was out and was soon followed by Major Larry and Captain Fred  Garrison. Dick Rover knew what was up and took his time about showing  himself, since he did not wish any of the hazers to be captured.    \"Call the roll!\" said Major Larry, after making a round of the company  streets. But he himself was in no particular hurry.    Almost out of breath with running, the hazers came into camp,  accompanied by Hans and Tubbs. Masks, caps, and horns were pushed out  of sight under cots, and then all sallied forth to join their various  commands. Calling the roll was already in progress.    \"All present or accounted for,\" came the declaration, five minutes  later.    \"All present, eh?\" mused Captain Putnam. \"That's queer. Who fired that  gun?\"    \"Private Jackson.\"    \"I will interview Jackson,\" said the master of the school, and he  ordered Jackson to his private tent.    \"What made you raise the alarm, Jackson?\" he questioned sharply.    \"I thought some of the cadets were out of camp, sir,\" was the answer.    \"Did you see them go?\"    \"Not exactly, sir, but I thought I saw three or four of them sneaking  along near the woods.\"    \"Humph! You should be sure of what you are doing, Jackson. It is not  commendable to arouse the whole camp at midnight for nothing.\"    \"Well, I thought I was sure,\" insisted the crestfallen cadet. He knew  for a certainty that some of the cadets had been out but saw no way to  prove it.    \"In the future be more careful while on guard duty,\" said Captain  Putnam coldly; and there the subject was dropped.    \"Who fired that shot?\" asked Sam, on the morning following the hazing.    \"Jackson,\" replied a cadet named Gilson, who had been one of the  hazers.    \"The sneak!\" murmured the youngest Rover.    \"That's what I say, Rover.\"    \"Guess he did it to get square for losing that swimming race,\" put in  another of the hazers.    \"More than likely. We ought to square up with him for it.\"    \"That's the talk.\"    \"Vat's der madder mit tossing him a blanket up?\" asked Hans earnestly.    \"Think that's a good way to get square, eh, Hans?\" laughed Sam.    \"Dot's der vorst bunishments vot I know of,\" said the German boy with  deep conviction. \"Makes you feel like you vos going to preak abard  alretty kvick!\"    All of the boys knew that it would not do to try any more hazing for  the next few nights. Even if the guards gave no alarm, Captain Putnam  or one of the teachers might be on the watch to catch them.    On the following day it rained and the majority of the cadets were glad  enough to remain under shelter. A few went bathing or fishing and the  latter brought in quite a"]]]
