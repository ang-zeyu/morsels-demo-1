But the fury of the Scots musketeers was not to be abated by  any difficulties; they mounted the hill, scaled the works like madmen,  running upon the enemies' pikes, and after two hours' desperate fight  in the midst of fire and smoke, took it by storm, and put all the  garrison to the sword. The volunteers did their part, and had their  share of the loss too, for thirteen or fourteen were killed out of  thirty-seven, besides the wounded, among whom I received a hurt more  troublesome than dangerous by a thrust of a halberd into my arm, which  proved a very painful wound, and I was a great while before it was  thoroughly recovered.    The king received us as we drew off at the foot of the hill, calling  the soldiers his brave Scots, and commending the officers by name.  The next morning the castle was also taken by storm, and the greatest  booty that ever was found in any one conquest in the whole war; the  soldiers got here so much money that they knew not what to do with it,  and the plunder they got here and at the battle of Leipsic made them  so unruly, that had not the king been the best master of discipline in  the world, they had never been kept in any reasonable bounds.    The king had taken notice of our small party of volunteers, and though  I thought he had not seen me, yet he sent the next morning for Sir  John Hepburn, and asked him if I were not come to the army? \"Yes,\"  says Sir John, \"he has been here two or three days.\" And as he was  forming an excuse for not having brought me to wait on his Majesty,  says the king, interrupting him, \"I wonder you would let him thrust  himself into a hot piece of service as storming the Port Graft.  Pray let him know I saw him, and have a very good account of his  behaviour.\" Sir John returned with this account to me, and pressed  me to pay my duty to his Majesty the next morning; and accordingly,  though I had but an ill night with the pain of my wound, I was with  him at the levee in the castle.    I cannot but give some short account of the glory of the morning; the  castle had been cleared of the dead bodies of the enemies, and what  was not pillaged by the soldiers was placed under a guard. There was  first a magazine of very good arms for about 18,000 or 20,000 foot,  and 4000 horse, a very good train of artillery of about eighteen  pieces of battery, thirty-two brass field-pieces, and four mortars.  The bishop's treasure, and other public monies not plundered by the  soldiers, was telling out by the officers, and amounted to 400,000  florins in money; and the burghers of the town in solemn procession,  bareheaded, brought the king three tons of gold as a composition to  exempt the city from plunder. Here was also a stable of gallant horses  which the king had the curiosity to go and see.    When the ceremony of the burghers was over, the king came down into  the castle court, walked on the parade (where the great train of  artillery was placed on their carriages) and round the walls, and gave  order for repairing the bastion that was stormed by the Scots; and  as at the entrance of the parade Sir John Hepburn and I made our  reverence to the king, \"Ho, cavalier!\" said the king to me, \"I am glad  to see you,\" and so passed forward. I made my bow very low, but his  Majesty said no more at that time.    When the view was over the king went up into the lodgings, and Sir  John and I walked in an antechamber for about a quarter of an hour,  when one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber came out to Sir John, and  told him the king asked for him; he stayed but a little with the king,  and come out to me and told me the king had ordered him to bring me to  him.    His Majesty, with a countenance full of honour and goodness,  interrupted my compliment, and asked me how I did; at which answering  only with a bow, says the king, \"I am sorry to see you are hurt; I  would have laid my commands on you not to have shown yourself in so  sharp a piece of service, if I had known you had been in the camp.\"  \"Your Majesty does me too much honour,\" said I, \"in your care of a  life that has yet done nothing to deserve your favour.\" His Majesty  was pleased to say something very kind to me relating to my behaviour  in the battle of Leipsic, which I have not vanity enough to write;  at the conclusion whereof, when I replied very humbly that I was not  sensible that any service I had done, or could do, could possibly  merit so much goodness, he told me he had ordered me a small testimony  of his esteem, and withal gave me his hand to kiss. I was now  conquered, and with a sort of surprise told his Majesty I found myself  so much engaged by his goodness, as well as my own inclination, that  if his Majesty would please to accept of my devoir, I was resolved to  serve in his army, or wherever he pleased to command me. \"Serve  me,\" says the king, \"why, so you do, but I must not have you be a  musketeer; a poor soldier at a dollar a week will do that.\" \"Pray,  Sir John,\" says the king, \"give him what commission he desires.\" \"No  commission, sir,\" says I, \"would please me better than leave to fight  near your Majesty's person, and to serve you at my own charge till I  am qualified by more experience to receive your commands.\" \"Why, then,  it shall be so,\" said the king, \"and I charge you, Hepburn,\" says he,  \"when anything offers that is either fit for him, or he desires, that  you tell me of it;\" and giving me his hand again to kiss, I withdrew.    I was followed before I had passed the castle gate by one of the  king's pages, who brought me a warrant, directed to Sir John Hepburn,  to go to the master of the horse for an immediate delivery of things  ordered by the king himself for my account, where being come, the  equerry produced me a very good coach with four horses, harness, and  equipage, and two very fine saddle-horses, out of the stable of the  bishop's horses afore-mentioned; with these there was a list for three  servants, and a warrant to the steward of the king's baggage to defray  me, my horses, and servants at the king's charge till farther order.  I was very much at a loss how to manage myself in this so strange  freedom of so great a prince, and consulting with Sir John Hepburn, I  was proposing to him whether it was not proper to go immediately back  to pay my duty to his Majesty, and acknowledge his bounty in the best  terms I could; but while we were resolving to do so, the guards stood  to their arms, and we saw the king go out at the gate in his coach  to pass into the city, so we were diverted from it for that time. I  acknowledge the bounty of the king was very surprising, but I must say  it was not so very strange to me when I afterwards saw the course of  his management. Bounty in him was his natural talent, but he never  distributed his favours but where he thought himself both loved and  faithfully served, and when he was so, even the single actions of  his private soldiers he would take particular notice of himself, and  publicly own, acknowledge, and reward them, of which I am obliged to  give some instances.    A private musketeer at the storming the castle of Wurtzburg, when  all the detachment was beaten off, stood in the face of the enemy and  fired his piece, and though he had a thousand shot made at him, stood  unconcerned, and charged his piece again, and let fly at the enemy,  continuing to do so three times, at the same time beckoning with his  hand to his fellows to come on again, which they did, animated by his  example, and carried the place for the king.    When the town was taken the king ordered the regiment to be drawn out,  and calling for that soldier, thanked him before them all for  taking the town for him, gave him a thousand dollars in money, and a  commission with his own hand for a foot company, or leave to go home,  which he would. The soldier took the commission on his knees, kissed  it, and put it into his bosom, and told the king, he would never leave  his service as long as he lived.    This bounty of the king's, timed and suited by his judgment, was  the reason that he was very well served, entirely beloved, and most  punctually obeyed by his soldiers, who were sure to be cherished and  encouraged if they did well, having the king generally an eye-witness  of their behaviour.    My indiscretion rather than valour had engaged me so far at the battle  of Leipsic, that being in the van of Sir John Hepburn's brigade,  almost three whole companies of us were separated from our line, and  surrounded by the enemies' pikes. I cannot but say also that we were  disengaged rather by a desperate charge Sir John made with the whole  regiment to fetch us off, than by our own valour, though we were not  wanting to ourselves neither, but this part of the action being talked  of very much to the advantage of the young English volunteer, and  possibly more than I deserved, was the occasion of all the distinction  the king used me with ever after.    I had by this time letters from my father, in which, though with some  reluctance, he left me at liberty to enter into arms if I thought fit,  always obliging me to be directed, and, as he said, commanded by  Sir John Hepburn. At the same time he wrote to Sir John Hepburn,  commending his son's fortunes, as he called it, to his care, which  letters Sir John showed the king unknown to me.    I took care always to acquaint my father of every circumstance, and  forgot not to mention his Majesty's extraordinary favour, which so  affected my father, that he obtained a very honourable mention of it  in a letter from King Charles to the King of Sweden, written by his  own hand.

The BNA nomenclature has been adopted in part, but by no means to the  exclusion of the old terminology, which is certainly a far more efficient  means of introducing an ultimate uniform nomenclature than an immediate  complete change to the BNA system.

THE BACKWARD CHILD, A STUDY OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF BACKWARDNESS: A PRACTICAL  MANUAL FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.  By Barbara Spoffard Morgan. G. P.  Putnam's Sons, New York, 1914.  Pp.  xvii plus 263.    This book by Mrs. Morgan, which is somewhat unique and certainly very  different from other books on the same subject, promises to be one of the  most widely read educational works which has recently appeared. It is based  on two years' experience in an experimental clinic for backward children in  New York City and the author states that, \"It is an effort to persuade  teachers and parents, in spite of a hide-bound educational system, to study  the children that interest them as individuals and to recognize their  faculties and tendencies.\" It \"Looks to a future when teachers will so  understand every child's mental structure that his whole education will be  directed to the fortifying of his weak points and the development of his  tendencies.\"    The author terms her process \"mental analysis\" and says it differs from the  Binet and Simon tests in that they are merely to classify children, and her  method discovers peculiarities and also gives the training necessary to  bring the child up to normal.  She gives a psychological basis for her work  which will be surprising to many readers because of its great divergence  from the usual psychological treatment. The child's mind is considered as  having four primary processes, namely: (1) Sense Impressions, (2)  Recollections of Sense Impressions, (3) Association Channels (4) Abstraction  Processes.  As the child grows older these are elaborated into Imagination,  Reasoning, and Expression. Attention is of three kinds:  (1) Homogeneous  Attention or concentrating, which consists in attending to one thing for a  period of time; (2) Simultaneous Attention or observing, which consists in  giving attention to a number of things at once; and (3) Disparate Attention,  or giving attention to two or more things over a period of time. Memory may  be (1) Automatic, (2) Voluntary, or (3) Retentive.  The function of the  tests is to determine just which one of these processes are weak or strong  and discover a method of education which is suited to the individual. Other  mental processes, such as sensation, perception, abstraction, and judgment  are discussed, and an interesting treatment distinguishing between the  analytic and synthetic type of mind is given.    One of the most important parts of the book is the discussion of the way in  which the tests are given. She insists that the relation of the child and  the examiner be very personal and informal and that the process be varied as  much as possible in order to prevent crystallization. Many of the tests are  the same, or much the same, as those of Simon and Binet, but the greatest of  liberty is taken in adapting them to the particular case.  Much use is made  of conversation, puzzle-pictures and other little friendly means by which  the personal characteristics of the child may be learned. After this is  done, the proper training of the child is to be selected and the effort made  to bring him back to normality, for which purpose, some quaint and  interesting devices are used. One case given is that of a little girl whose  senses of sound and form were defective and who therefore could not learn  her letters. These letters were pasted on the keys of a piano and she was  taught to play a piece with one finger, meanwhile chanting over the names of  the letters as they were struck. In this way her sense of sound was trained,  she learned her letters and gained ability to learn more and faster.  Abstraction may be strengthened by having the child measure distances with a  rule, first calculating the distance with his eye. The power of association  may be made stronger by having the individual sort words or pictures which  are pasted on slips of cardboard; he is to arrange them according to meaning  or according to the activities with which they have to do. Simultaneous  attention may be trained by such games as \"Hide-the-thimble\" or Jack-straws,  and homogeneous attention may be trained by some such action as hammering  nails in the upper left hand corners of all the squares on a board.  Imagination is developed by retelling stories, and invention by solving  puzzles; voluntary memory is strengthened by writing original rhymes and  automatic memory may be strengthened by having the child write out a list of  all the things in his kitchen or any other room with which he may happen to  be familiar.    Different types of backward children are described and a few pages are  devoted to a discussion of hysteria.    It is a book which will, in all probability, arouse considerable discussion  and which will find some warm friends and some determined enemies. As one  more publication calling attention to this important problem, it is of great  value and it will probably be read more widely than any other book in this  field which has appeared.  Perhaps its greatest practical value lies in its  suggestiveness as to the ways in which one may use his personality and  initiative in dealing with backward children, rather than sticking so  closely to prescribed tests and methods.

Putnam s Sons, New York and London, 1914.  Pp.  v, 131.    The most obvious particular wisdom of the present scientific period is  undoubtedly just that concept denoted by the title of this volume,  continuity.  And this wisdom is advanced wisdom and, withal, wisdom which is  very expedient and even indispensable at this day, as a reaction required to  set right the over-specialization of recent minds thoughtful only of some  little branch of knowledge. Just in proportion as one esteems \"authority\"  will one give heed to the pronouncement of the presidential address before  the British Association, yet for its own intrinsic sake it is a piece of  work which cannot be ignored.    Interesting and revolutionary as are the recent additions to philosophical  physics brought about by the discovery of radium and its like, it is the  other phase of this great physicist's mental trend which particularly  interests the student of human behavior-- that wisdom which gives him (as it  gave William James, and for a like reason), the bravery to look a bit beyond  the more or less materialistic confines of mere science into the broader  realm. And strange, is it not, that a man NEED be brave in this twentieth  century Domini to discuss spiritism and survival and telepathy? Only those  do it who cannot \"lose their jobs.\"  Can one indeed honestly doubt that many  an intelligent psychologist to-day is kept from investigating this pressing  phase of knowledge largely, or even solely, by the materialistic incubus  whose continuance still stands for an academic salary usually sufficient to  buy wife and children bread, if not a little meat?    \"Material bodies are all that we have any control over, are all that we are  experimentally aware of; anything that we can do with these is open to us;  any conclusions we can draw about them may be legitimate and true. But to  step outside their province and to deny the existence of any other region  because we have no sense-organs for its appreciation, or because (like the  ether) it is too uniformly omnipresent for our ken, is to wrest our  advantages and privileges from their proper use and apply them to our own  misdirection.\" . . . \"I am one of those who think that the methods of  science are not so limited in their scope as has been thought: that they can  be applied much more widely, and that the psychic region can be studied and  brought under law too.  Allow us anyhow to make the attempt. Give us a fair  field.  Let those who prefer the materialistic hypothesis by all means  develop their thesis as far as they can; but let us try what we can do in  the psychical region, and see which wins. Our methods are really the same as  theirs--the subject-matter differs. Neither should abuse the other for  making the attempt.\"    Here is this matter in a nutshell, and the evolution of cosmology in the  last few years makes this"]]]
