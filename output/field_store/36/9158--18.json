'We have adorned the lower heaven with the ornament of stars, and we  have placed therein a guard against every rebellious devil, that they  may not listen to the discourse of exalted princes, for they are  darted at from every side, to repel them, and a lasting torment is  prepared for them; except him who catcheth a word by stealth, and is  pursued by a shining flame' (Chapter 37). [W. H. 8.] Passages of this  kind should he remembered by persons who expect orthodox Muhammadans  to accept the results of modern science.          CHAPTER 6      Hindoo Marriages.    Certain it is that no Hindoo will have a marriage in his family  during the four months of the rainy season; for among eighty millions  of souls[1] not one doubts that the Great Preserver of the universe  is, during these four months, down on a visit to Raja Bali, and,  consequently, unable to bless the contract with his presence.[2]    Marriage is a sacred duty among Hindoos, a duty which every parent  must perform for his children, otherwise they owe him no reverence. A  family with a daughter unmarried after the age of puberty is  considered to labour under the displeasure of the gods; and no member  of the other sex considers himself _respectable_ after the age of  puberty till he is married. It is the duty of his parent or elder  brothers to have him suitably married; and, if they do not do so, he  reproaches them with his _degraded condition_. The same feeling, in a  degree, pervades all the Muhammadan community; and nothing appears so  strange to them as the apparent indifference of old bachelors among  us to their _sad condition_.    Marriage, with all its ceremonies, its rights, and its duties, fills  their imagination from infancy to age; and I do not believe there is  a country upon earth in which a larger portion of the wealth of the  community is spent in the ceremonies, or where the rights are better  secured, or the duties better enforced, notwithstanding all the  disadvantages of the laws of polygamy. Not one man in ten can afford  to maintain more than one wife, and not one in ten of those who can  afford it will venture upon 'a sea of troubles' in taking a second,  if he has a child by the first. One of the evils which press most  upon Indian society is the necessity which long usage has established  of squandering large sums in marriage ceremonies. Instead of giving  what they can to their children to establish them, and enable them to  provide for their families and rise in the world, parents everywhere  feel bound to squander all they can borrow in the festivities of  their marriage. Men in India could never feel secure of being  permitted freely to enjoy their property under despotic and unsettled  governments, the only kind of governments they knew or hoped for; and  much of the means that would otherwise have been laid out in forming  substantial works, with a view to a return in income of some sort or  another, for the remainder of their own lives and of those of their  children, were expended in tombs, temples, sarais, tanks, groves, and  other works--useful and ornamental, no doubt, but from which neither  they nor their children could ever hope to derive income of any kind.  The same feeling of insecurity gave birth, no doubt, to this  preposterous usage, which tends so much to keep down the great mass  of the people of India to that grade in which they were born, and in  which they have nothing but their manual labour to depend upon for  their subsistence. Every man feels himself bound to waste all his  stock and capital, and exhaust all his credit, in feeding idlers  during the ceremonies which attend the marriage of his children,  because his ancestors squandered similar sums, and he would sink in  the estimation of society if he were to allow his children to be  married with less.    But it could not have been solely because men could not invest their  means in profitable works, with any chance of being long permitted to  enjoy the profits under such despotic and unsettled governments, that  they squandered them in feeding idle people in marriage ceremonies;  since temples, tanks, and groves secured esteem in this life, and  promised some advantage in the next, and an outlay in such works  might therefore have been preferred. But under such governments a  man's title even to the exclusive possession of his wife might not be  considered as altogether secure under the mere sanction of religion;  and the outlay in feeding the family, tribe, and neighbourhood during  the marriage ceremony seems to have been considered as a kind of  value in exchange given for her to society. There is nothing that she  and her husband recollect through life with so much pride and  pleasure as the cost of their marriage, if it happen to be large for  their condition of life; it is their _amoka_, their title of  nobility;[3] and their parents consider it their duty to make it as  large as they can. A man would hardly feel secure of the sympathy of  his family, tribe, circle of society, or rulers, for the loss of 'his  ox, or his ass, or anything that is his', if it should happen to have  cost him nothing; and, till he could feel secure of their sympathy  for the loss, he would not feel very secure in the possession. He,  therefore, or those who are interested in his welfare, strengthen his  security by an outlay which invests his wife with a tangible value in  cost, well understood by his circle and rulers. His family, tribe,  and circle have received the purchase money, and feel bound to secure  to him the commodity purchased; and, as they are in all such matters  commonly much stronger than the rulers themselves, the money spent  among them is more efficacious in securing the exclusive enjoyment of  the wife than if it had been paid in taxes or fees to them for a  marriage licence.[4] The pride of families and tribes, and the desire  of the multitude to participate in the enjoyment of such ceremonies,  tend to keep up this usage after the cause in which it originated may  have ceased to operate; but it will, it is to be hoped, gradually  decline with the increased feeling of security to person, property,  and character under our rule. Nothing is now more common than to see  an individual in the humblest rank spending all that he has, or can  borrow, in the marriage of one of many daughters, and trusting to  Providence for the means of marrying the others; nor in the higher,  to find a young man, whose estates have, during a long minority,  under the careful management of Government officers, been freed from  very heavy debts, with which an improvident father had left them  encumbered, the moment he attains his majority and enters upon the  management, borrowing three times their annual rent, at an exorbitant  interest, to marry a couple of sisters, at the same rate of outlay in  feasts and fireworks that his grandmother was married with.[5]      Notes:    1. The author's figure of 'eighty millions' was a mere guess, and  probably, even in his time, was much below the mark. The figures of  the census of 1911 are:   Total population of India, excluding    Burma  . . . . 301,432,623    Hindus . . . . 217,197,213  The proportions in different provinces vary enormously.    2. See _ante_. Chapter 1, note 3.    3. The word _amoka_ is corrupt, and even Sir George Grierson cannot  suggest a plausible explanation. Can it be a misprint for _anka_, in  the sense of 'stamp'?    4. Akbar levied a tax on marriages, ranging from a single copper coin  (_dam_ = 1/40th of rupee) for poor people to 10 gold mohurs, or about  150 rupees, for high officials. Abul Fazl declares that 'the payment  of this tax is looked upon as auspicious', a statement open to doubt  (Blochmann, transl. _Ain_, vol. i, p. 278). In 1772 Warren Hastings  abolished the marriage fees levied up to that time in Bengal by the  Muhammadan law-officers. But I am disposed to think that a modern  finance minister might reconsider the propriety of imposing a  moderate tax, carefully graduated.    5. Extravagance in marriage expenses is still one of the principal  curses of Indian society. Considerable efforts to secure reform have  been made by various castes during recent years, but, as yet, small  results only have been attained. The editor has seen numerous painful  examples of the wreck of fine estates by young proprietors assuming  the management after a long term of the careful stewardship of the  Court of Wards.          CHAPTER 7      The Purveyance System,    We left Jubbulpore on the morning of the 20th November, 1835, and  came on ten miles to Baghauri. Several of our friends of the 29th  Native Infantry accompanied us this first stage, where they had a  good day's shooting. In 1830 I established here some venders in wood  to save the people from the miseries of the purveyance system; but I  now found that a native collector, soon after I had resigned the  civil charge of the district, and gone to Sagar,[1] in order to  ingratiate himself with the officers and get from them favourable  testimonials, gave two regiments, as they marched over this road,  free permission to help themselves gratis out of the store-rooms of  these poor men, whom I had set up with a loan from the public  treasury, declaring that it must be the wish and intention of  Government to supply their public officers free of cost; and  consequently that no excuses could be attended to. From that time  shops and shopkeepers have disappeared. Wood for all public officers  and establishments passing this road has ever since, as in former  times, been collected from the surrounding villages gratis, under the  purveyance system, in which all native public officers delight, and  which, I am afraid, is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15488"],[0,"Woman's Life in Colonial Days (#16)"],[1,", was       her attentive hearing most that I read upon those heads through       the long evenings of the winters as we sat together.\"[62]    Mrs. Adams was still another example of that rare womanliness which  could combine with practical domestic ability a taste for high  intellectual pursuits. During the Revolutionary days in the hour of  deepest anxiety for the welfare of her husband and of her country, she  wrote to Mr. Adams: \"I have taken a great fondness for reading Rollin's  _Ancient History_ since you left me. I am determined to go through with  it, if possible, in these days of solitude.\"[63] And again in a letter  written on December 5, 1773, to Mercy Warren, she says: \"I send with  this the first volume of Moliere and should be glad of your opinion of  the plays. I cannot be brought to like them. There seems to me to be a  general want of spirit. At the close of every one, I have felt  disappointed. There are no characters but what appear unfinished; and he  seems to have ridiculed vice without engaging us to virtue.... There is  one negative virtue of which he is possessed, I mean that of decency....  I fear I shall incur the charge of vanity by thus criticising an author  who has met with so much applause.... I should not have done it, if we  had not conversed about it before.\"[64]    Evidently, at least a few of those colonial dames who are popularly  supposed to have stayed at home and \"tended their knitting\" were  interested in and enthusiastically conversed about some rather classic  authors and rather deep questions. Mrs. Grant has told us of the aunt of  General Philip Schuyler, a woman of great force of character and  magnetic personality: \"She was a great manager of her time and always  contrived to create leisure hours for reading; for that kind of  conversation which is properly styled gossiping she had the utmost  contempt.... Questions in religion and morality, too weighty for table  talk, were leisurely and coolly discussed [In the garden].\"[65]    Again, Mrs. Grant pays tribute to her mental ability as well as to her  intelligent interest in vital questions of the hour, in the following  statement: \"She clearly foresaw that no mode of taxation could be  invented to which they would easily submit; and that the defense of the  continent from enemies and keeping the necessary military force to  protect the weak and awe the turbulent would be a perpetual drain of men  and money to Great Britain, still increasing with the increased  population.\"[66]    There were indeed brilliant minds among the women of colonial days; but  for the most part the women of the period were content with a rather  small amount of intellectual training and did not seek to gain that  leadership so commonly sought by women of the twentieth century.  Practically the only view ahead was that of the home and domestic life,  and the whole tendency of education for woman was, therefore, toward the  decidedly practical.      _IV. Practical Education_    These brilliant women, like their sisters of less ability, had no  radical ideas about what they considered should be the fundamental  principles in female education; they one and all stood for sound  training in domestic arts and home making. Abigail Adams, whose tact,  thrift and genuine womanliness was largely responsible for her husband's  career, expressed herself in no uncertain terms concerning the duties of  woman: \"I consider it as an indispensable requisite that every American  wife should herself know how to order and regulate her family; how to  govern her domestics and train up her children. For this purpose the  All-wise Creator made woman an help-meet for man and she who fails in  these duties does not answer the end of her creation.\"[67]    Indeed, it would appear that most, if not all, of the women of colonial  days agreed with the sentiment of Ben Franklin who spoke with warm  praise of a printer's wife who, after the death of her husband, took  charge of his business \"with such success that she not only brought up  reputably a family of children, but at the expiration of the term was  able to purchase of me the printing house and establish her son in  it.\"[68] And, according to this practical man, her success was due  largely to the fact that as a native of Holland she had been taught \"the  knowledge of accounts.\" \"I mention this affair chiefly for the sake of  recommending that branch of education for our young females as likely to  be of more use to them and their children in case of widowhood than  either music or dancing, by preserving them from losses by imposition of  crafty men, and enabling them to continue perhaps a profitable  mercantile house with establish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up  fit to undertake and go on with it.\"[69]    And Mrs. Franklin, like her husband and Mrs. Adams, had no doubt of the  necessity of a thorough knowledge of household duties for every woman  who expected to marry. In 1757 she wrote to her sister-in-law in regard  to the proposed marriage of her nephew: \"I think Miss Betsey a very  agreeable, sweet-tempered, good girl who has had a housewifely  education, and will make to a good husband a very good wife.\"    With these fundamentals in female education settled, some of the  colonists, at least, were very willing that the girls should learn some  of the intellectual \"frills\" and fads that might add to feminine grace  or possibly be of use in future emergencies. Franklin, for instance,  seemed anxious that Sally should learn her French and music. Writing to  his wife in 1758, he stated: \"I hope Sally applies herself closely to  her French and musick, and that I shall find she has made great  Proficiency. Sally's last letter to her Brother is the best wrote that  of late I have seen of hers. I only wish she was a little more careful  of her spelling. I hope she continues to love going to Church, and would  have her read over and over again the _Whole Duty of Man_ and the Lady's  Library.\"[70] And again in 1772 we find him writing this advice to Sally  after her marriage to Mr. Bache: \"I have advis'd him to settle down to  Business in Philadelphia where he will always be with you.... and I  think that in keeping a store, if it be where you dwell, you can be  serviceable as your mother was to me. For you are not deficient in  Capacity and I hope are not too proud.... You might easily learn  Accounts and you can copy Letters, or write them very well upon  Occasion. By Industry and Frugality you may get forward in the World,  being both of you yet young.\"[71]      _V. Educational Frills_    Toward the latter part of the eighteenth century that once-popular  institution, the boarding school for girls, became firmly established,  and many were the young \"females\" who suffered as did Oliver Wendell  Holmes' dear old aunt:        \"They braced my aunt against a board,        To make her straight and tall;      They laced her up, they starved her down,        To make her light, and small;      They pinched her feet, they singed her hair,        They screwed it up with pins;--      Oh, never mortal suffered more        In penance for her sins.\"    One of the best known of these seminaries was that conducted by Susanna  Rowson, author of the once-famous novel _Charlotte Temple_. A letter  from a colonial miss of fourteen years, Eliza Southgate, who attended  this school, may be enlightening:         \"Hon. Father:         \"I am again placed at school under the tuition of an amiable       lady, so mild, so good, no one can help loving her; she treats       all her scholars with such tenderness as would win the affection       of the most savage brute. I learn Embroiderey and Geography at       present, and wish your permission to learn Musick.... I have       described one of the blessings of creation in Mrs. Rowson, and       now I will describe Mrs. Lyman as the reverse: she is the worst       woman I ever knew of or that I ever saw, nobody knows what I       suffered from the treatment of that woman.\"[72]    The Moravian seminaries of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and of North  Carolina were highly popular training places for girls; for in these  orderly institutions the students were sure to gain not only instruction  in graceful social accomplishments and a thorough knowledge of  housekeeping, but the rare habit of doing all things with regularity,  neatness, decorum, and quietness. The writer of the above letter has  also described one of these Pennsylvania schools with its prim teachers  and commendable mingling of the practical and the artistic. \"The first  was merely a _sewing school_, little children and a pretty single  spinster about 30, her white skirt, white short tight waistcoat, nice  handkerchief pinned outside, a muslin apron and a close cap, of the most  singular form you can imagine. I can't describe it. The hair is all put  out of sight, turned back, and no border to the cap, very unbecoming and  very singular, tied under the chin with a pink ribbon--blue for the  married, white for the widows. Here was a Piano forte and another sister  teaching a little girl music. We went thro' all the different school  rooms, some misses of sixteen, their teachers were very agreeable and  easy, and in every room was a Piano.\"    It was a notable fact that dancing was taught in nearly all of these  institutes. In spite of Puritanical training, in spite of the  thunder-bolts of colonial preachers, the tide of public opinion could  not be stayed, and the girls _would_ learn the waltz and the prim  minuet. Times had indeed changed since the day when Cotton Mather so  sternly spoke his opinion on such an ungodly performance: \"Who were the  Inventors of Petulant Dancings? Learned men have well observed that the  Devil was the First Inventor of the impleaded Dances, and the Gentiles  who worshipped him the first Practitioners of this Art.\"    Colonial school girls may have been meek and lowly in the seventeenth"]]]
