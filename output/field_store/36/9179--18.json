I came into  being under the form of Pautti (or, in primeval time), I formed myself  out of the primeval matter, I made myself out of the substance that was  in primeval time.\"[1] Nothing existed at that time except the great  primeval watery mass called NU, but in this there were the germs of  everything that came into being subsequently. There was no heaven, and  no earth, and the god found no place on which to stand; nothing, in  fact, existed except the god. He says, \"I was alone.\" He first created  himself by uttering his own name as a word of power, and when this was  uttered his visible form appeared. He then uttered another kind of word  of power, and as a result of this his soul (_ba_) came into being, and  it worked in connection with his heart or mind (_ab_). Before every act  of creation Nebertcher, or his visible form Khepera, thought out what  form the thing to be created was to take, and when he had uttered its  name the thing itself appeared in heaven or earth. To fill the heaven,  or place where he lived, the god next produced from his body and its  shadow the two gods Shu and Tefnut. These with Nebertcher, or Khepera,  formed the first triad of gods, and the \"one god became three,\" or, as  we should say, the one god had three aspects, each of which was quite  distinct from the other. The tradition of the begetting of Shu and  Tefnut is as old as the time of the pyramids, for it is mentioned in the  text of Pepi I, l. 466. The next act of creation resulted in the  emerging of the Eye of Nebertcher (later identified with Ra) from the  watery mass (NU), and light shone upon its waters. Shu and Tefnut then  united and they produced Keb, the Earth-god, and Nut, the Sky-goddess.  The text then refers to some calamity which befell the Eye of Nebertcher  or of Khepera, but what it was is not clear; at all events the Eye  became obscured, and it ceased to give light. This period of darkness  is, of course, the night, and to obviate the inconvenience caused by  this recurring period of darkness, the god made a second Eye, _i.e._ the  Moon, and set it in the heavens. The greater Eye ruled the day, and the  lesser Eye the night. One of the results of the daily darkness was the  descent of the Sky-goddess Nut to the Earth-god Keb each evening.    [Footnote 1: The second version here states that the name of Nebertcher  is Ausares (Osiris), who is the oldest god of all.]    The gods and goddesses next created were five, namely, Osiris, Horus,  Set, Isis, and Nephthys. Osiris married Isis, and their son was called  Horus; Set married Nephthys, but their son Anpu, or Anubis, is not  mentioned in our text. Osiris became the great Ancestor-god of Egypt,  and was a reincarnation of his great-grandfather. Men and women were  first formed from the tears that fell from the Eye of Khepera, or the  Sun-god, upon his body; the old Egyptian word for \"men\" very closely  resembles in form and sound the word for \"tears.\" Plants, vegetables,  herbs, and trees owe their origin to the light of the moon falling upon  the earth. Our text contains no mention of a special creation of the  \"beasts of the field,\" but the god states distinctly that he created the  children of the earth, or creeping things of all kinds, and among this  class quadrupeds are probably included. The men and women, and all the  other living creatures that were made at that time by Nebertcher, or  Khepera, reproduced their species, each in his own way, and thus the  earth became filled with their descendants as we see at the present  time. The elements of this Creation legend are very, very old, and the  form in which they are grouped in our text suggests the influence of the  priests of Heliopolis. It is interesting to note that only very ancient  gods appear as Powers of creation, and these were certainly worshipped  for many centuries before the priests of Heliopolis invented their cult  of the Sun-god, and identified their god with the older gods of the  country. We may note, too, that gods like Ptah and Amen, whose  reputation was so great in later times, and even when our text was  copied in 305 B.C., find no mention at all.                                         CHAPTER VII                               LEGENDS OF THE GODS      The Egyptians believed that at one time all the great gods and goddesses  lived upon earth, and that they ruled Egypt in much the same way as the  Pharaohs with whom they were more or less acquainted. They went about  among men and took a real personal interest in their affairs, and,  according to tradition, they spared no pains in promoting their wishes  and well-being. Their rule was on the whole beneficent, chiefly because  in addition to their divine attributes they possessed natures, and  apparently bodily constitutions that were similar to those of men. Like  men also they were supposed to feel emotions and passions, and to be  liable to the accidents that befell men, and to grow old, and even to  die. The greatest of all the gods was Ra, and he reigned over Egypt for  very many years. His reign was marked by justice and righteousness, and  he was in all periods of Egyptian history regarded as the type of what a  king should be. When men instead of gods reigned over Egypt they all  delighted to call themselves sons of Ra, and every king believed that Ra  was his true father, and regarded his mother's husband as his father  only in name. This belief was always common in Egypt, and even Alexander  the Great found it expedient to adopt it, for he made a journey to the  sanctuary of Amen (Ammon) in the Oasis of Siwah in order to be  officially acknowledged by the god. Having obtained this recognition, he  became the rightful lord of Egypt.                             THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND    This Legend is cut in hieroglyphs on the walls of a small chamber in the  tomb of Seti I about 1350 B.C. When Ra, the self-begotten and  self-formed god, had been ruling gods and men for some time, men began  to complain about him, saying, \"His Majesty hath become old. His bones  have turned into silver, his flesh into gold, and his hair into real  lapis-lazuli.\" His Majesty heard these murmurings and commanded his  followers to summon to his presence his Eye (_i.e._ the goddess Hathor),  Shu, Tefnut, Keb, Nut, and the father and mother gods and goddesses who  were with him in the watery abyss of NU, and also the god of this water,  NU. They were to come to him with all their followers secretly, so that  men should not suspect the reason for their coming, and take flight, and  they were to assemble in the Great House in Heliopolis, where Ra would  take counsel with them. In due course all the gods assembled in the  Great House, and they ranged themselves down the sides of the House, and  they bowed down in homage before Ra until their heads touched the  ground, and said, \"Speak, for we are listening.\" Then Ra addresing Nu,  the father of the first-born gods, told him to give heed to what men  were doing, for they whom he had created were murmuring against him. And  he said, \"Tell me what ye would do. Consider the matter, invent a plan  for me, and I will not slay them until I have heard what ye shall say  concerning this thing.\" Nu replied, \"Thou, O my son Ra, art greater than  the god who made thee (_i.e._ Nu himself), thou art the king of those  who were created with thee, thy throne is established, and the fear of  thee is great. Let thine Eye (Hathor) attack those who blaspheme thee.\"  And Ra said, \"Lo, they have fled to the mountains, for their hearts are  afraid because of what they have said.\" The gods replied, \"Let thine Eye  go forth and destroy those who blasphemed thee, for no eye can resist  thine when it goeth forth in the form of Hathor.\" Thereupon the Eye of  Ra, or Hathor, went in pursuit of the blasphemers in the mountains, and  slew them all. On her return Ra welcomed her, and the goddess said that  the work of vanquishing men was dear to her heart. Ra then said that he  would be the master of men as their king, and that he would destroy  them. For three nights the goddess Hathor-Sekhmet waded about in the  blood of men, the slaughter beginning at Hensu (Herakleopolis Magna).    Then the Majesty of Ra ordered that messengers should be sent to Abu, a  town at the foot of the First Cataract, to fetch mandrakes (?), and when  they were brought he gave them to the god Sekti to crush. When the women  slaves were bruising grain for making beer, the crushed mandrakes (?)  were placed in the vessels that were to hold the beer, together with  some of the blood of those who had been slain by Hathor. The beer was  then made, and seven thousand vessels were filled with it. When Ra saw  the beer he ordered it to be taken to the scene of slaughter, and poured  out on the meadows of the four quarters of heaven. The object of putting  mandrakes (?) in the beer was to make those who drank fall asleep  quickly, and when the goddess Hathor came and drank the beer mixed with  blood and mandrakes (?) she became very merry, and, the sleepy stage of  drunkenness coming on her, she forgot all about men, and slew no more.  At every festival of Hathor ever after \"sleepy beer\" was made, and it  was drunk by those who celebrated the feast.    Now, although the blasphemers of Ra had been put to death, the heart of  the god was not satisfied, and he complained to the gods that he was  smitten with the \"pain of the fire of sickness.\" He said, \"My heart is  weary because I have to live with men; I have slain some of them, but  worthless men still live, and I did not slay as many as I ought to have  done considering my power.\" To this the gods replied, \"Trouble not about  thy lack of action, for thy power is in proportion to thy will.\" Here  the text becomes fragmentary, but it seems that the goddess Nut took the  form of a cow, and that the other gods lifted Ra on to her back. When  men saw that Ra was leaving the earth,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15950"],[0,"Wilderness Ways (#16)"],[1,"a muskrat at his supper. It was  twilight in the woods. I had drifted in close to shore in my canoe to  see what Musquash was doing on top of a rock. All muskrats have  favorite eating places--a rock, a stranded log, a tree boll that leans  out over the water, and always a pretty spot--whither they bring food  from a distance, evidently for the purpose of eating it where they  feel most at home. This one had gathered a half dozen big fresh-water  clams onto his dining table, and sat down in the midst to enjoy the  feast. He would take a clam in his fore paws, whack it a few times on  the rock till the shell cracked, then open it with his teeth and  devour the morsel inside. He ate leisurely, tasting each clam  critically before swallowing, and sitting up often to wash his  whiskers or to look out over the lake. A hermit thrush sang  marvelously sweet above him; the twilight colors glowed deep and  deeper in the water below, where his shadow was clearly eating clams  also, in the midst of heaven's splendor.--Altogether a pretty scene,  and a moment of peace that I still love to remember. I quite forgot  that Musquash is a villain. But the tragedy was near, as it always is  in the wilderness. Suddenly a movement caught my eye on the bank  above. Something was waving nervously under the bushes. Before I could  make out what it was, there was a fearful rush, a gleam of wild yellow  eyes, a squeak from the muskrat. Then Upweekis, looking gaunt and dark  and strange in his summer coat, was crouched on the rock with Musquash  between his great paws, growling fiercely as he cracked the bones. He  bit his game all over, to make sure that it was quite dead, then took  it by the back of the neck, glided into the bushes with his stub tail  twitching, and became a shadow again.    Another time I was perched up in a lodged tree, some twenty feet from  the ground, watching a big bait of fish which I had put in an open  spot for anything that might choose to come and get it. I was hoping  for a bear, and so climbed above the ground that he might not get my  scent should he come from leeward. It was early autumn, and my  intentions were wholly peaceable. I had no weapon of any kind.    Late in the afternoon something took to chasing a red squirrel near  me. I heard them scurrying through the trees, but could see nothing.  The chase passed out of hearing, and I had almost forgotten it, for  something was moving in the underbrush near my bait, when back it came  with a rush. The squirrel, half dead with fright, leaped from a  spruce-tip to the ground, jumped onto the tree in which I sat, and  raced up the incline, almost to my feet, where he sprang to a branch  and sat chattering hysterically between two fears. After him came a  pine marten, following swiftly, catching the scent of his game, not  from the bark or the ground, but apparently from the air. Scarcely had  he jumped upon my tree when there was a screech and a rush in the  underbrush just below him, and out of the bushes came a young lynx to  join in the chase. He missed the marten on the ground, but sprang to  my tree like a flash. I remember still that the only sound I was  conscious of at the time was the ripping of his nails in the dead  bark. He had been seeking my bait undoubtedly--for it was a good lynx  country, and Upweekis loves fish like a cat--when the chase passed  under his nose and he joined it on the instant.    Halfway up the incline the marten smelled me, or was terrified by the  noise behind him and leaped aside. A branch upon which I was leaning  swayed or snapped, and the lucivee stopped as if struck, crouching  lower and lower against the tree, his big yellow expressionless eyes  glaring straight into mine. A moment only he stood the steady look;  then his eyes wavered; he turned his head, leaped for the underbrush,  and was gone.    Another moment and Meeko the squirrel had forgotten his fright and  peril and everything else save his curiosity to find out who I was and  all about me. He had to pass quite close to me to get to another tree,  but anything was better than going back where the marten might be  waiting; so he was presently over my head, snickering and barking to  make me move, and scolding me soundly for disturbing the peace of the  woods. In summer Upweekis is a solitary creature, rearing his young  away back on the wildest burned lands, where game is plenty and where  it is almost impossible to find him except by accident. In winter also  he roams alone for the most part; but occasionally, when rabbits are  scarce, as they are periodically in the northern woods, he gathers in  small bands for the purpose of pulling down big game that he would  never attack singly. Generally Upweekis is skulking and cowardly with  man; but when driven by hunger (as I found out once) or when hunting  in bands, he is a savage beast and must be followed cautiously.    I had heard much of the fierceness of these hunting bands from  settlers and hunters; and once a friend of mine, an old backwoodsman,  had a narrow escape from them. He had a dog, Grip, a big brindled cur,  of whose prowess in killing \"varmints\" he was always bragging, calling  him the best \"lucififer\" dog in all Canada. Lucififer, by the way, is  a local name for the lynx on the upper St. John, where Grip and his  master lived.    One day in winter the master missed a young heifer and went on his  trail, with Grip and his axe for companions. Presently he came to lynx  tracks, then to signs of a struggle, then plump upon six or seven of  the big cats snarling savagely over the body of the heifer. Grip, the  lucififer dog, rushed in blindly, and in two minutes was torn to  ribbons. Then the lynxes came creeping and snarling towards the man,  who backed away, shouting and swinging his axe. He killed one by a  lucky blow, as it sprang for his chest. The others drove him to his  own door; but he would never have reached it, so he told me, but for a  long strip of open land that he had cleared back into the woods. He  would face and charge the beasts, which seemed more afraid of his  voice than of the axe, then run desperately to keep them from circling  and getting between him and safety. When he reached the open strip  they followed a little way along the edges of the underbrush, but  returned one at a time when they were sure he had no further mind to  disturb their feast or their fighting.    It is curious that when Upweekis and his hunting pack pull down game  in this way the first thing they do is to fight over it. There may be  meat enough and to spare, but under their fearful hunger is the old  beastly instinct for each one to grab all for himself; so they fall  promptly to teeth and claws before the game is dead. The fightings at  such times are savage affairs, both to the eye and ear. One forgets  that Upweekis is a shadow, and thinks that he must be a fiend.    One day in winter, when after caribou, I came upon a very large lynx  track, the largest I have ever seen. It was two days old; but it led  in my direction, toward the caribou barrens, and I followed it to see  what I should see.    Presently it joined four other lynx trails, and a mile farther on all  five trails went forward in great flying leaps, each lynx leaving a  hole in the snow as big as a bucket at every jump. A hundred yards of  this kind of traveling and the trails joined another trail,--that of a  wounded caribou from the barrens. His tracks showed that he had been  traveling with difficulty on three legs. Here was a place where he had  stood to listen; and there was another place where even untrained eyes  might see that he had plunged forward with a start of fear. It was a  silent story, but full of eager interest in every detail.    The lucivee tracks now showed different tactics. They crossed and  crisscrossed the trail, appearing now in front, now behind, now on  either side the wounded bull, evidently closing in upon him warily.  Here and there was a depression in the snow where one had crouched,  growling, as the game passed. Then the struggle began. First, there  was a trampled place in the snow where the bull had taken a stand and  the big cats went creeping about him, waiting for a chance to  spring all together. He broke away from that, but the three-legged  gallop speedily exhausted him. Only when he trots is a caribou  tireless. The lynxes followed the deadly cat-play began again. First  one, then another leaped, only to be shaken off; then two, then all  five were upon the poor brute, which still struggled forward. The  record was written red all over the snow.    [Illustration: The lynxes and caribou]    As I followed it cautiously, a snarl sounded just ahead. I kicked off  my snowshoes and circled noiselessly to the left, so as to look out  over a little opening. There lay the stripped carcass of the caribou  with two lynxes still upon it, growling fearfully at each other as  they pulled at the bones. Another lynx crouched in the snow, under a  bush, watching the scene. Two others circled about each other  snarling, looking for an opening, but too well fed to care for a fight  just then. Two or three foxes, a pine marten, and a fisher moved  ceaselessly in and out, sniffing hungrily, and waiting for a chance to  seize every scrap of bone or skin that was left unguarded for an  instant. Above them a dozen moose birds kept the same watch  vigilantly. As I stole nearer, hoping to get behind an old log where I  could lie and watch the spectacle, some creature scurried out of the  underbrush at one side. I was watching the movement, when a loud  _kee-yaaah!_ startled me; I whirled towards the opening. From behind  the old log a fierce round head with tasseled ears rose up, and the  big lynx, whose trail I had first followed, sprang into sight snarling  and spitting viciously.    The feast stopped at the first alarm. The marten disappeared  instantly. The foxes and the fisher and one lynx slunk away."]]]
