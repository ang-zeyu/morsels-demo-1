You had your reasons, you were here last  night.... Then why don't they arrest you? Why not you, as you were  here and I was not and know nothing, absolutely nothing of what  happened.... Why isn't it you?\"    The last words were pronounced in a hardly intelligible fashion. She had  no strength left. She had to sit down, with her head bent over her knees,  and she wept once more, abundantly.    Perenna went up to her and, raising her forehead and uncovering the  tear-stained face, said:    \"The imprints of teeth in both apples are absolutely identical. There is  therefore no doubt whatever but that the first comes from you as well as  the second.\"    \"No!\" she said.    \"Yes,\" he affirmed. \"That is a fact which it is materially impossible to  deny. But the first impression may have been left by you before last  night, that is to say, you may have bitten that apple yesterday, for  instance--\"    She stammered:    \"Do you think so? Yes, perhaps, I seem to remember--yesterday morning--\"    But the Prefect of Police interrupted her.    \"It is useless, Madame; I have just questioned your servant, Silvestre.  He bought the fruit himself at eight o'clock last evening. When M.  Fauville went to bed, there were four apples in the dish. At eight  o'clock this morning there were only three. Therefore the one found in  the garden is incontestably the fourth; and this fourth apple was marked  last night. And the mark is the mark of your teeth.\"    She stammered:    \"It was not I ... it was not I ... that mark is not mine.\"    \"But--\"    \"That mark is not mine.... I swear it as I hope to be saved.... And I  also swear that I shall die, yes, die.... I prefer death to prison.... I  shall kill myself.... I shall kill myself--\"    Her eyes were staring before her. She stiffened her muscles and made a  supreme effort to rise from her chair. But, once on her feet, she  tottered and fell fainting on the floor.    While she was being seen to, Mazeroux beckoned to Don Luis and whispered:    \"Clear out, Chief.\"    \"Ah, so the orders are revoked? I'm free?\"    \"Chief, take a look at the beggar who came in ten minutes ago and who's  talking to the Prefect. Do you know him?\"    \"Hang it all!\" said Perenna, after glancing at a large red-faced man who  did not take his eyes off him. \"Hang it, it's Weber, the deputy chief!\"    \"And he's recognized you, Chief! He recognized Lupin at first sight.  There's no fake that he can't see through. He's got the knack of it.  Well, Chief, just think of all the tricks you've played on him and ask  yourself if he'll stick at anything to have his revenge!\"    \"And you think he has told the Prefect?\"    \"Of course he has; and the Prefect has ordered my mates to keep you in  view. If you make the least show of trying to escape them, they'll  collar you.\"    \"In that case, there's nothing to be done?\"    \"Nothing to be done? Why, it's a question of putting them off your scent  and mighty quickly!\"    \"What good would that do me, as I'm going home and they know where I  live?\"    \"Eh, what? Can you have the cheek to go home after what's happened?\"    \"Where do you expect me to sleep? Under the bridges?\"    \"But, dash it all, don't you understand that, after this job, there will  be the most infernal stir, that you're compromised up to the neck as it  is, and that everybody will turn against you?\"    \"Well?\"    \"Drop the business.\"    \"And the murderers of Cosmo Mornington and the Fauvilles?\"    \"The police will see to that.\"    \"Alexandre, you're an ass.\"    \"Then become Lupin again, the invisible, impregnable Lupin, and do your  own fighting, as you used to. But in Heaven's name don't remain Perenna!  It is too dangerous. And don't occupy yourself officially with a business  in which you are not interested.\"    \"The things you say, Alexandre! I am interested in it to the tune of a  hundred millions. If Perenna does not stick to his post, the hundred  millions will be snatched from under his nose. And, on the one occasion  when I can earn a few honest centimes, that would be most annoying.\"    \"And, if they arrest you?\"    \"No go! I'm dead!\"    \"Lupin is dead. But Perenna is alive.\"    \"As they haven't arrested me to-day, I'm easy in my mind.\"    \"It's only put off. And the orders are strict from this moment onward.  They mean to surround your house and to keep watch day and night.\"    \"Capital. I always was frightened at night.\"    \"But, good Lord! what are you hoping for?\"    \"I hope for nothing, Alexandre. I am sure. I am sure now that they will  not dare arrest me.\"    \"Do you imagine that Weber will stand on ceremony?\"    \"I don't care a hang about Weber. Without orders, Weber can do nothing.\"    \"But they'll give him his orders.\"    \"The order to shadow me, yes; to arrest me, no. The Prefect of Police has  committed himself about me to such an extent that he will be obliged to  back me up. And then there's this: the whole affair is so absurd, so  complicated, that you people will never find your way out of it alone.  Sooner or later, you will come and fetch me. For there is no one but  myself able to fight such adversaries as these: not you nor Weber, nor  any of your pals at the detective office. I shall expect your visit,  Alexandre.\"    On the next day an expert examination identified the tooth prints on the  two apples and likewise established the fact that the print on the cake  of chocolate was similar to the others.    Also, the driver of a taxicab came and gave evidence that a lady engaged  him as she left the opera, told him to drive her straight to the end of  the Avenue Henri Martin, and left the cab on reaching that spot.    Now the end of the Avenue Henri Martin was within five minutes' walk of  the Fauvilles' house.    The man was brought into Mme. Fauville's presence and recognized  her at once.    What had she done in that neighbourhood for over an hour?    Marie Fauville was taken to the central lockup, was entered on the  register, and slept, that night, at the Saint-Lazare prison.    That same day, when the reporters were beginning to publish details of  the investigation, such as the discovery of the tooth prints, but when  they did not yet know to whom to attribute them, two of the leading  dailies used as a headline for their article the very words which Don  Luis Perenna had employed to describe the marks on the apple, the  sinister words which so well suggested the fierce, savage, and so to  speak, brutal character of the incident:    \"THE TEETH OF THE TIGER.\"          CHAPTER FIVE    THE IRON CURTAIN      It is sometimes an ungrateful task to tell the story of Arsene Lupin's  life, for the reason that each of his adventures is partly known to the  public, having at the time formed the subject of much eager comment,  whereas his biographer is obliged, if he would throw light upon what is  not known, to begin at the beginning and to relate in full detail all  that which is already public property.    It is because of this necessity that I am compelled to speak once more of  the extreme excitement which the news of that shocking series of crimes  created in France, in Europe and throughout the civilized world. The  public heard of four murders practically all at once, for the particulars  of Cosmo Mornington's will were published two days later.    There was no doubt that the same person had killed Cosmo Mornington,  Inspector Verot, Fauville the engineer, and his son Edmond. The same  person had made the identical sinister bite, leaving against himself or  herself, with a heedlessness that seemed to show the avenging hand of  fate, a most impressive and incriminating proof, a proof which made  people shudder as they would have shuddered at the awful reality: the  marks of his or her teeth, the teeth of the tiger!    And, in the midst of all this bloodshed, at the most tragic moment  of the dismal tragedy, behold the strangest of figures emerging from  the darkness!    An heroic adventurer, endowed with astounding intelligence and insight,  had in a few hours partly unravelled the tangled skeins of the plot,  divined the murder of Cosmo Mornington, proclaimed the murder of  Inspector Verot, taken the conduct of the investigation into his own  hands, delivered to justice the inhuman creature whose beautiful white  teeth fitted the marks as precious stones fit their settings, received a  cheque for a million francs on the day after these exploits and, finally,  found himself the probable heir to an immense fortune.    And here was Arsene Lupin coming to life again!    For the public made no mistake about that, and, with wonderful intuition,  proclaimed aloud that Don Luis Perenna was Arsene Lupin, before a close  examination of the facts had more or less confirmed the supposition.    \"But he's dead!\" objected the doubters.    To which the others replied:    \"Yes, Dolores Kesselbach's corpse was recovered under the still smoking  ruins of a little chalet near the Luxemburg frontier and, with it, the  corpse of a man whom the police identified as Arsene Lupin. But  everything goes to show that the whole scene was contrived by Lupin, who,  for reasons of his own, wanted to be thought dead. And everything shows  that the police accepted and legalized the theory of his death only  because they wished to be rid of their everlasting adversary.    \"As a proof, we have the confidences made by Valenglay, who was Prime  Minister at the time and whom the chances of politics have just replaced  at the head of the government. And there is the mysterious incident on  the island of Capri when the German Emperor, just as he was about to be  buried under a landslip, was saved by a hermit who, according to the  German version, was none other than Arsene Lupin.\"    To this came a fresh objection:    \"Very well; but read the newspapers of the time: ten minutes  afterward, the hermit flung himself into the sea from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13065"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 1 (#16)"],[1,"you as soon  as possible. Likewise a Grand Overture to \"Ungarn's erste Wohlthaeter\"  [Hungary's First Benefactors].    Both form part of two works that I wrote for the Hungarians at the opening  of their new theatre [in Pesth]. Pray give me, however, your written  assurance that these works shall not be performed elsewhere, as they are  not published, nor likely to be so for some time to come. You shall receive  the latter Grand Overture as soon as it is returned to me from Hungary,  which it will be in the course of a few days.    The engraved Fantasia with Chorus could no doubt be executed by a lady, an  amateur, mentioned to me here by Professor Schneller.[2] The words after  the Chorus No. 4, in C major, were altered by the publishers, and are now  quite contrary to the musical expression; those written in _pencil_,  therefore, on the music must be sung. If you can make use of the Oratorio,  I can send you _all the parts written out_, so that the outlay may be less  for the poor. Write to me about this.    Your obedient    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The correspondence with Varenna, consisting of fourteen  letters and four notes, was purchased some years ago by a collector of  autographs in Leipzig, and sold again by public auction, probably to  different persons. It would be like pursuing leaves scattered by the wind  to try to recover these letters. Those here given have for the most part  appeared in newspapers; I cannot, therefore, be responsible for the text,  farther than their publication goes, which, however, has evidently been  conducted by a clever hand. The date of the first letter is to be gleaned  from the second, and we also learn from them that _The Ruins of Athens_ and  _King Stephen_ (or at all events the Overture) were already finished in  January, 1812.]    [Footnote 2: This _dilettante_ was Mdlle. Marie Koschak, subsequently the  wife of Dr. Pachler, an advocate in Gratz, from whom two letters are given  by Schindler of the dates of August 15th, 1825, and November 5th, 1826, in  which she invites Beethoven to visit her in Gratz. Schindler considers as  applicable to this lady the words of a note in Beethoven's writing of which  he has given a fac-simile in his _Biography_, I. 95; the date 1817 or 1818.  They are as follows:--\"Love alone, yes! love alone can make your life  happier. O God! grant that I may at last find her who can strengthen me in  virtue, whom I can legitimately call my own. On July 27th, when she drove  past me in Baden, she seemed to gaze at me.\" This lady also plays a  friendly part in Franz Schubert's _Life_. See her _Biography_ by Dr.  Kreissle.]      81.    TO ZMESKALL.    Feb. 2, 1812.    By no means _extraordinary_, but _very ordinary_ mender of pens! whose  talent has failed on this occasion (for those I send require to be fresh  mended), when do you intend at last to cast off your fetters?--when? You  never for a moment think of me; accursed to me is life amid this Austrian  barbarism. I shall go now chiefly to the \"Swan,\" as in other taverns I  cannot defend myself against intrusion. Farewell! that is, _fare as well_  as I wish you to do without    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    Most wonderful of men! We beg that your servant will engage a person to fit  up my apartment; as he is acquainted with the lodgings, he can fix the  proper price at once. Do this soon, you Carnival scamp!!!!!!!    The enclosed note is at least a week old.      82.    TO ZMESKALL.    Feb. 8, 1812.    Most extraordinary and first and foremost man of the pendulum in the world,  and without a lever too!!!    I am much indebted to you for having imparted to me some share of your  motive power. I wish to express my gratitude in person, and therefore  invite you this morning to come to the \"Swan,\"--a tavern, the name of which  itself shows that it is a fitting place when such a subject is in question,    Yours ever,    BEETHOVEN.      83.    TO VARENNA,--GRATZ.    Vienna, Feb. 8, 1812.    Herr Rettich has already got the parts of the Oratorio, and when you no  longer require them I beg you will send them back to me. It is not probable  that anything is wanting, but even in that case, as you have the score, you  can easily remedy this. I only yesterday received the Overtures from  Hungary, and shall have them copied and forwarded to you as soon as  possible. I likewise send a March with a vocal Chorus, also from the \"Ruins  of Athens.\" Altogether you will now have sufficient to fill up the time.    As these pieces are only in manuscript, I shall let you know at the time I  send them what precautions I wish you to take with regard to the Overtures  and the March with Chorus.    As I do not publish any new work until a year after its composition, and,  when I do so, am obliged invariably to give a written assurance to the  publisher that no one is in possession of it, you can yourself perceive  that I must carefully guard against any possible contingency or casualty as  to these pieces. I must, however, assure you that I shall always be  disposed to show the warmest zeal in aid of your charity, and I here pledge  myself to send you every year works that exist solely in manuscript, or  compositions written expressly for this charitable purpose. I beg you will  also let me know what your future plans are with regard to your  institution, that I may act accordingly.    Farewell! I remain, with the highest consideration,    Your obedient    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      84.    TO ZMESKALL.[1]    Feb. 19, 1812.    DEAR Z.,--    I only yesterday received the written information that the Archduke pays  his share in the new paper-money of the full value [_Einloesungsschein_]. I  beg you will write out for me, as nearly as you can, the substance of what  you said on Sunday, and which we thought it advisable to send to the other  two. I am offered a certificate that the Archduke is to pay in  _Einloesungsschein_, but I think this unnecessary, more especially as the  people about Court, in spite of all their apparent friendship for me,  declare that my demands are _not just_!!!! O Heaven! aid me in enduring  this! I am no Hercules, to help Atlas in carrying the world, or to strive  to do so in his place. It was only yesterday that I heard the particulars  of the handsome manner in which Baron von Kraft had judged and spoken of me  to Zisius! But never mind, dear Z.! My endurance of these shameful attacks  cannot continue much longer; persecuted art will everywhere find an  asylum--Daedalus, though imprisoned in a labyrinth, found wings to carry  him aloft. Oh! I too shall find wings!    Yours ever,    BEETHOVEN.    If you have time, send me this morning the draft of the memorial;--probably  for nothing, and to receive nothing! so much time is already lost, and only  to be kept in suspense by civil words!    [Footnote 1: The Finance Patent appeared in Austria in 1811, by which the  value of money was depreciated by a fifth. This also affected the salary  that Beethoven drew from the Archduke Rudolph, Prince Kinsky, and Prince  Lobkowitz. The first of these gentlemen paid his full share in  _Einloesungsschein_. Lobkowitz, at the request of Beethoven, soon after did  the same; with Kinsky's share alone difficulties arose subsequently, owing  to his death.]      85.    TO VARENNA.    Lent, 1812.    In spite of my anxiety to serve the cause of your charity, I have been  quite unable to do so. I have no copyist of my own to write for me as  formerly, and the limited time renders it impossible for me to do so  myself; thus I am obliged to have recourse to strangers as copyists. One of  these promised to write out the Overtures, &c., &c., for you; but Passion  Week intervening, when there are so many concerts, prevented his being able  to keep his word, in spite of every effort on my part. Even if the  Overtures and the March with Chorus were transcribed, it would not be  possible to send them by this post, and if we wait for the next, the music  will arrive too late for Easter Sunday. Let me know if there are any means  you could adopt to gain a little more time, or any chance opportunity of  sending these works to you, and I will do all that lies in my power to aid  the cause of your charity.    I am, with esteem, yours obediently,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      86.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.[1]    1812.    YOUR IMPERIAL HIGHNESS,--    I was much vexed not to receive Y.I.H.'s message to come to you till very  late yesterday evening--indeed nearly at eleven o'clock. Contrary to my  usual custom, I did not go home at all during the afternoon, the fine  weather having tempted me to spend the whole afternoon in walking, and the  evening at the Banda, \"auf der Wieden,\" and thus I was not aware of your  wish till I returned home. In the mean time, whenever Y.I.H. desires it, I  am ready at any hour or moment to place myself at your disposal. I  therefore await your gracious commands.    I am your Imperial Highness's most obedient    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The date 1812 is marked on the sheet by another hand, and the  close of the second note proves that it was at the commencement of this  year.]      87.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1812.    YOUR IMPERIAL HIGHNESS,--    I was unable till to-day, when I leave my bed for the first time, to answer  your gracious letter. It will be impossible for me to wait on you  to-morrow, but perhaps the day after. I have suffered much during the last  few days, and I may say two-fold from not being in a condition to devote a  great part of my time to you, according to my heartfelt wish. I hope now,  however, to have cleared off all scores for spring and summer (I mean as to  health).    I am your Imperial Highness's most obedient servant,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      88.    TO VARENNA,--GRATZ.    Vienna, May 8, 1812.    SIR,--    Being still far from well, and much occupied, I have been unable to reply  to your letters. How in the world did such an"]]]
