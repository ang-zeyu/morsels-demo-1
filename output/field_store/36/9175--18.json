[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#16)"],[1," of adaptability to a  fresh set of industrial circumstances is almost entirely gone. One of  the first consequences of a new invention may be, and often is, that  work which had hitherto been performed by men can now be done by women  and boys; or an occupation which had formerly taken years to learn can  now be mastered in a few weeks. In other cases the new machine is able  to do the work of twenty, fifty, or a hundred men; the article  produced is so immensely cheapened that the old handicraftsman is  driven out of the field; if he is a man entering into years, and  therefore unable to turn his hand to something else, the bread is  practically taken out of his mouth, and the machine, which is  undoubtedly a benefit to the community as a whole, means starvation to  him as an individual. When such circumstances occur, and positive  proof in abundance can be adduced to show that they do take place, the  position of the aged worker becomes a very hard and embarrassing one.  He finds it a very uphill task to change the whole course of his  industrial activities at a period of life when nature has lost much of  her elasticity; the new means he has had to adopt in order to earn a  livelihood are irksome to him; the diminished sum he is now able to  earn per week depresses his spirits and deprives him of certain little  comforts he had long been accustomed to enjoy; but in spite of these  unforeseen and unexpected hardships it is marvellous to see how nobly  working-men, as a rule, struggle on to the end, like a bird with a  broken wing. There are, however, cases in which the struggle is given  up. It would be impossible to enumerate all the causes which lead to  such a deplorable result; sometimes these causes are personal,  sometimes they are social, while in many instances they are a  combination of both. But, whatever such circumstances may be in  origin, the effects of them are generally the same; the worker who is  incapable of adjusting himself to his new industrial surroundings has  few alternatives before him. These alternatives, unless he is  supported by his family or relations, resolve themselves into the  Union, beggary, or theft. Many choose the Union and, with all its  drawbacks, it is undoubtedly the wisest choice; but others have such a  horror of the restraints imposed upon the inmates of a workhouse that  they enter upon the perilous and precarious career of the beggar or  petty thief. The men who make such a choice as this are not, as may  easily be surmised, the pick of their class. They consist, to a good  extent, of persons who have been somewhat unsteady in their habits;  they are not downright drunkards, and they have never allowed drink to  interfere with their regular occupation; but it has been their  immemorial custom to go in for a good deal of drinking on Saturday  nights; on Bank holidays, and other festive occasions. Sensible  workmen do not care to amuse themselves after this fashion; it is  rather too like a savage orgie for most tastes; at the same time it is  the only form of amusement which certain sections of the populace  truly and heartily enjoy, and, on the whole, it is perhaps better that  this rude form of merry-making should remain, than that the multitude  should be deprived of every outlet for the pent-up exuberance of their  spirits. My own impression is, that the rough and boisterous element  which shows itself so conspicuously when the labouring population is  at play will never be eradicated so long as men and women have to  spend so much of their time within the four walls of workshops and  factories, where so much restraint and suppression of the individual  is imperative, if the industrial machine is to go on. It is not at all  unnatural that the severe regularity and monotony of an existence  chiefly spent in this manner should be occasionally interspersed with  outbursts of somewhat boisterous revelry, and the persons who indulge  in it are not to be set down off-hand as worthless characters, because  they sometimes step beyond due and proper bounds. At the same time it  must be admitted that it is generally from the ranks of this class  that the supreme aversion to the workhouse proceeds, and that the  disposition to live by begging, rather than enter it, most largely  prevails. If it happens, therefore, that a man who has lived the life  we have just described is thrown out of employment, by the  introduction of machinery, at a period when he is too old to turn his  hand to something else, he not unfrequently ends by becoming a beggar,  and this continues to be his occupation to the last.    The second cause which leads a certain number of elderly men to adopt  a life of vagrancy is to be attributed to the action of Trades-Unions.  After a workman reaches a certain period of life he is no longer able  to do a full day's work. As soon as this period of life arrives, and  sometimes even before it does arrive, the artisan finds it becoming  increasingly difficult to obtain employment. The rate of wages in his  trade is fixed by Trades-Union rules; every man, no matter what his  qualifications may be, has to receive so much an hour, or the full  Trade-Union wage for the district; no one is allowed to take a job at  a lower figure. No doubt Trades-Unionists find that this regulation  works well an far as it relates to the young and the able-bodied, and  as these always compose the great majority in every trade society, it  is a regulation which is not likely to be rescinded or modified.  Nevertheless, it is a rule which often operates very unjustly in the  case of men who are getting old. These men may have been steady and  industrious workmen all their lives, they may still be able to do a  fair amount of honest work; but, as soon as that amount of work falls  below the daily average of the trade, such men have to go; they are  henceforth practically debarred from earning an honest livelihood at  what has hitherto been the occupation of their working life. Work may  be abundant in the district, but it is useless for grey-haired men to  apply; they cannot do the amount required, and as they are not  permitted to work at a lower rate of wages than their fellows, the  means of getting a living are arbitrarily taken out of their hands. As  a consequence of these Trades-Union enactments, cases are not  infrequent in which workmen who have just passed middle life, or have  sustained injuries, drift insensibly into vagrant habits. These habits  are acquired almost without their knowing it. In the vague hope of  perhaps finding something to do a man will wander from town to town  existing as best he can; after the hope of employment has died away he  still continues to wander, and thus forms an additional unit in the  permanent army of beggars and vagrants. Trade-Unionists would  undoubtedly remedy a great wrong if some effective means were devised  by them to meet cases of this character. It should be remembered by  those most opposed to any modifications of the present system that  they may one day be its victims. The hindrances in the way of putting  an end to the injustice inherent in the present arrangements are not  incapable of being overcome. It is surely possible to devise a rule  which, while leaving intact the essential features of the present  system, will render it more flexible--a rule to enable the maimed and  the aged who cannot do a full day's work to make, through the Union if  need be, some special arrangement with the employers. Such a rule, if  properly safe-guarded to prevent abuse, would be of inestimable  benefit to many a working man.    If the step here suggested were adopted by the Trade Societies, it  would, according to calculations which I have made, reduce the begging  population by about two per cent. This percentage, in my opinion,  represents the number of vagrants who are able and willing to do a  certain amount of work, but cannot get it to do. It is a percentage  which at any rate does not err on the side of being too low; when  trade is at its ordinary level it is perhaps a little too high. In any  case this proportion may be taken as a tolerably accurate estimate of  the numbers of the vagrant class which will not enter the Unions when  out of employment, and are consequently forced by the pressure of want  to resort to a life of beggary.    The proportion here indicated of the number of vagrants who are  willing to work coincides in a remarkable manner with certain  statistics recently collected by H. Monod of the Ministry of the  Interior in France.[19] According to M. Monod a benevolently disposed  French citizen wished to know the amount of truth contained in the  complaints of sturdy beggars, that they were willing to work if they  could get anything to do or anyone to employ them. This gentleman  entered into negotiations with some merchants and manufacturers, and  induced them to offer work at the rate of four francs a day to every  person presenting himself furnished with a letter of recommendation  from him. In eight months 727 sturdy beggars came under his notice,  all complaining that they had no work. Each of them was asked to come  the following day to receive a letter which would enable him to get  employment at four francs a day in an industrial establishment. More  than one half (415) never came for the letter; a good many others  (138) returned for the letter but never presented it. Others who did  present their letter worked half a day, demanded two francs and were  seen no more. A few worked a whole day and then disappeared. In short,  out of the whole 727 only 18 were found at work at the end of the  third day. As a result of this experiment M. Monod concludes that not  more than one able-bodied beggar in 40 is inclined to work even if he  is offered a fair remuneration for his services.

It will be noticed that the same  combinations are used for 2 and Z, 3 and _tion_, 4 and F, 5 and J,  6 and G, 7 and V, 9 and M, and 0 and B. The following abbreviations were  given in the Manual:    Abbreviations.    a   after       n   not         ur    your  b   before      r   are         w     word  c   can         t   the         wi    with  h   have        u   you         y     yes    These abbreviations saved a lot of time, for when we wanted to signal  the word _after_ instead of spelling it out--22-2221-2-12-211-3--we  used the signal for A--22--followed by 3 to signify that it was the end  of the word. Before was represented by 2112-3, _your_ by 111-211-3,  etc. It took quite a little practice to learn the different  combinations. Fred and Reddy soon became experts, and could flash the  signals back and forth at a great rate.      WIGWAGGING AT NIGHT.    [Illustration: Fig. 152. Wigwagging at Night.]    At night we used a torch in place of a flag. The torch consisted of a  roll of dried birch bark tied with wire to the end of a staff. It was  found necessary to place another torch on the ground directly in front  of the signaler so as to fix a central point and enable one to determine  whether the moving torch was swung to the left or right. A later  improvement was to use three lanterns, one in each hand and one attached  to the waist to fix the central position. It was quite an advantage to  have a lantern in each hand, for it saved changing over from one to the  other when a second movement followed a first or a first movement a  second.      THE HELIOGRAPH.    The book that Uncle Ed sent us had in it a description of a heliograph,  that is, an instrument for sending signals with flashes of sunlight.  Although our wigwagging system was good enough for our requirements, yet  we thought it would be more scientific to use the sun instrument, and  besides, the latter could be used for signaling many miles.      THE SINGLE MIRROR INSTRUMENT.    [Illustration: Fig. 153. Trunnion for Mirror.]    [Illustration: Fig. 154. The Single Mirror Instrument.]    The first thing we did was to procure a small mirror about 4 inches  square, mounted in a wooden frame. Then we got a pair of small square  head bolts about 1/4 of an inch in diameter and 1 inch long, also two  strips of brass 1/2 inch wide and 3 inches long. In the center of each  brass strip we drilled a hole just large enough to admit the shank of  one of the bolts, and then the strips were fastened with screws tight  against opposite edges of the mirror frame, with the heads pressed  against the frame and the shanks sticking out at each side, as shown in  Fig. 153. These projecting shanks served as \"trunnions\" (that is,  pivots) for the mirror to turn on when it was mounted in place. After  the trunnions had been set in place we made a peep hole in the center of  the mirror by cutting out a piece of the wooden back of the frame and  scratching away the silver from the back of the glass. Only a very small  hole was required, about 1/8 inch in diameter. Great care was taken to  have the unsilvered spot exactly on a line with the trunnions and just  half-way between them. This done, we took two sticks of 3/8-inch wood, 1  inch wide and 3-1/2 inches long. In the upper end of each stick a slot  was cut 1/2 inch deep and 1/4 inch wide. Into these slots the trunnions  of the mirror were placed, and then the nuts were screwed tightly on,  clamping the sticks against the sides of the mirror. The sticks were now  connected by nailing a 1/2-inch strip at the bottom, and braced by a  couple of corner pieces. This formed a swiveled frame for the mirror,  which was clamped to the base of the instrument by means of a bolt 1-1/2  inches long. The bolt passed through the bottom board of the frame,  squarely under the peep hole of the mirror and through the baseboard of  the instrument near one end. The baseboard was 2 inches wide, 10 inches  long and 3/4 inch thick.      THE SIGHT ROD.    [Illustration: Fig. 155. The Sight Rod.]    [Illustration: Fig. 156. Nut Set in Baseboard.]    At the end opposite to where the mirror frame was swiveled we mounted a  sight rod, which was merely a round stick of wood 1/2 inch in diameter  and about 8 inches long. We cut the stick from one of the rounds of an  old broken chair. The upper end of the rod was whittled to a point and  one side was flattened as shown in Fig. 155. Out of a piece of heavy  white cardboard we cut a round disk about 1/4 inch in diameter, with a  shank 1 inch long sticking out at one side. This was fastened with a  single tack to the flattened end of the rod in such a position that the  point lay exactly against the center of the disk. The disk could then be  turned up or down, to cover or uncover the point of the rod, as desired.  The rod was fitted snugly into a hole in the baseboard, and could be  raised or lowered to any extent desired, but we had to provide some sort  of an arrangement for making it stay where it was put. A small hole was  drilled from the edge of the baseboard through to the hole in which the  rod was fitted. A square socket was chiseled out around the small hole  to receive a nut. The nut was firmly wedged in and held in place by  driving in nails along the edges. A bolt or machine screw was threaded  through the nut, so that its inner end pressed against the sighting rod.  By tightening this screw the rod could be secured at any height desired.    The instrument was mounted on a tripod similar to the one used for our  surveying instrument. To this it was attached by means of a bolt, which  passed through the center of the baseboard and the tripod head.      THE SCREEN.    [Illustration: Fig. 157. Section through Shutter.]    [Illustration: Fig. 158. General View of Screen.]    The screen, or shutter, of the heliograph was mounted on a separate  tripod, so as to prevent shaking the mirror when it was operated. It was  made something like a window shutter. We cut out two slats, each 2-1/2  inches wide and 6 inches long. They were made of hardwood 3/8 inch  thick. The upper and lower edges were tapered down to a thickness of  3/16 inch. Light nails were driven into the slats at the ends, and the  nail heads were then filed off so that the projecting ends formed  trunnions for the slats to turn on. The slats were linked to a  connecting rod with double point tacks. A small double point tack was  driven into the upper edge of each slat about 1/2 inch from the right  hand end. Then through each of these tacks we hooked a second double  point tack and drove it into the rod. The tacks on the rod were placed  just 2 inches apart. A substantial frame was then made of 3/4-inch stuff  1-1/2 inches wide. The frame was square, with an opening that measured 6  inches each way, into which the slats were fitted. Before nailing the  frame together we drilled holes in the side pieces for the trunnions of  the slats to turn in. These holes were just 1-3/4 inches apart. After  the slats had been set in place, the frame was fastened together and  then nailed to a baseboard, which was fastened by a bolt to the tripod.  The shutter was operated by a key something like a telegraph key. It was  made of a narrow stick of wood hinged at one end to the lower strip of  the shutter frame, and a spool sawed in two was fastened to the other  end to serve as a handle for the key. A string connected the key with  the connecting rod. The slats were kept closed by a spring, which was  fastened at one end to the connecting rod and at the other to the top of  the frame. At first we used a rubber band for this purpose, but it soon  wore out, so we then made a spiral spring out of stiff spring brass wire  by wrapping it around a pencil. When the key was pressed down the slats  would be turned open, as shown in Fig. 159; but as soon as the key was  released the spring would pull them back again.      FOCUSING THE INSTRUMENT.    [Illustration: Fig. 159. The Heliograph in Operation.]    We were now ready to commence operations with our instruments. The  heliograph was set up on the ledge at the top of the cliff. First the  disk was turned down, uncovering the point of the sighting rod. Then  Bill sighted through the unsilvered spot in the mirror and shifted the  rod up and down until the tip end came squarely in line with the door of  our straw hut, where Jack was seated, notebook in hand, to take down our  message. Reddy stood by him with his wigwag flag to answer back. When  the instrument was properly sighted the shutter was set up directly in  front of it and the sighting disk turned up to cover the point of the  sighting rod. Then came the rather troublesome task of focusing the  mirror. The mirror reflected a square panel of light, in the center of  which there was a small shadow spot made by the unsilvered peep hole.  The object was to get this shadow to fall on the center of the sighting  disk. We knew that then the mirror would reflect the sunlight squarely  on the straw hut. We found it quite easy to direct this shadow spot to  the disk by holding a sheet of paper in front of the mirror six or eight  inches away, and following up the spot on the paper until it reached the  disk.      HELIOGRAPH SIGNALING.    [Illustration: Fig. 160. Top View, showing position of Mirror and  Shutter.]    When at last we succeeded in properly focusing the mirror Bill pressed  the key down three times, sending three quick flashes to Jack as a  signal that he was ready to begin. Reddy wigwagged back O. K., and then  the first heliographic message was sent from the ledge to the island. It  was a rather mixed-up message, and kept Jim and Reddy wigwagging back  and forth very strenuously to straighten matters out. It was my duty to  keep the mirror focused. As the sun moved across the sky the shadow spot  would move off the disk, and I had to keep shifting the mirror to"]]]
