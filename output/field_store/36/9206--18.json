This is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth.  Check this lying hospitality and lying affection. Live no longer to  the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we  converse. Say to them, O father, O mother, O wife, O brother, O  friend, I have lived with you after appearances hitherto. Henceforward  I am the truth's. Be it known unto you that henceforward I obey no law  less than the eternal law. I will have no covenants but  proximities.[220] I shall endeavor to nourish my parents, to support  my family, to be the chaste husband of one wife,--but these relations  I must fill after a new and unprecedented way. I appeal from your  customs. I must be myself. I cannot break myself any longer for you,  or you.[221] If you can love me for what I am, we shall be the  happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you should.  I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that what is  deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever  inly rejoices me, and the heart appoints. If you are noble, I will  love you; if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself by  hypocritical attentions. If you are true, but not in the same truth  with me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own. I do this not  selfishly, but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest, and mine,  and all men's however long we have dwelt in lies, to live in truth.  Does this sound harsh to-day? You will soon love what is dictated by  your nature as well as mine, and, if we follow the truth, it will  bring us out safe at last.[222] But so may you give these friends  pain. Yes, but I cannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their  sensibility. Besides, all persons have their moments of reason, when  they look out into the region of absolute truth; then will they  justify me, and do the same thing.    The populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a  rejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism;[223] and the bold  sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the  law of consciousness abides. There are two confessionals, in one or  the other of which we must be shriven. You may fulfill your round of  duties by clearing yourself in the _direct_, or in the _reflex_ way.  Consider whether you have satisfied your relations to father, mother,  cousin, neighbor, town, cat, and dog; whether any of these can upbraid  you. But I may also neglect this reflex standard, and absolve me to  myself. I have my own stern claims and perfect circle. It denies the  name of duty to many offices that are called duties. But if I can  discharge its debts, it enables me to dispense with the popular code.  If any one imagines that this law is lax, let him keep its  commandment one day.    And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the  common motives of humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a  taskmaster. High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight,  that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself,  that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to  others!    If any man consider the present aspects of what is called by  distinction _society_, he will see the need of these ethics. The sinew  and heart of man seem to be drawn out, and we are become timorous,  desponding whimperers. We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune,  afraid of death, and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and  perfect persons. We want men and women who shall renovate life and our  social state, but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot  satisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to  their practical force,[224] and do lean and beg day and night  continually. Our housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, our occupations,  our marriages, our religion, we have not chosen, but society has  chosen for us. We are parlor soldiers. We shun the rugged battle of  fate, where strength is born.    If our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all  heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is _ruined_. If the  finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in  an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of  Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is  right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life.  A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the  professions, who _teams it, farms it_,[225] _peddles_, keeps a school,  preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so  forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet,  is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his  days, and feels no shame in not \"studying a profession,\" for he does  not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a  hundred chances. Let a Stoic[226] open the resources of man, and tell  men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves;  that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a  man is the word made flesh,[227] born to shed healing to the  nations,[228] that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that  the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books,  idolatries and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but  thank and revere him,--and that teacher shall restore the life of man  to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.    It is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution  in all the offices and relations of men; in their religion; in their  education; in their pursuits; their modes of living; their  association; in their property; in their speculative views.    1. In what prayers do men allow themselves![229] That which they call  a holy office is not so much as brave and manly. Prayer looks abroad  and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign  virtue, and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural,  and mediatorial and miraculous. Prayer that craves a particular  commodity,--anything less than all good,--is vicious. Prayer is the  contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view. It  is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul.[230] It is the  spirit of God pronouncing his works good. But prayer as a means to  effect a private end is meanness and theft. It supposes dualism and  not unity in nature and consciousness. As soon as the man is at one  with God, he will not beg. He will then see prayer in all action. The  prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it, the prayer of  the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard  throughout nature, though for cheap ends. Caratach,[231] in Fletcher's  Bonduca, when admonished to inquire the mind of the god Audate,  replies,--       \"His hidden meaning lies in our endeavors;      Our valors are our best gods.\"    Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the want  of self-reliance; it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities, if you  can thereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work, and  already the evil begins to be repaired. Our sympathy is just as base.  We come to them who weep foolishly, and sit down and cry for company,  instead of imparting to them truth and health in rough electric  shocks, putting them once more in communication with their own reason.  The secret of fortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods  and men is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide: him  all tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our  love goes out to him and embraces him, because he did not need it. We  solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate him, because he  held on his way and scorned our disapprobation. The gods love him  because men hated him. \"To the persevering mortal,\" said  Zoroaster,[232] \"the blessed Immortals are swift.\"    As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a  disease of the intellect. They say with those foolish Israelites, \"Let  not God speak to us, lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us, and  we will obey.\"[233] Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my  brother, because he has shut his own temple doors, and recites fables  merely of his brother's, or his brother's brother's God. Every new mind  is a new classification. If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and  power, a Locke,[234] a Lavoisier,[235] a Hutton,[236] a Betham,[237] a  Fourier,[238] it imposes its classification on other men, and lo! a new  system. In proportion to the depth of the thought, and so to the number  of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the pupil, is his  complacency. But chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches, which  are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental  thought of duty, and man's relation to the Highest. Such is  Calvinism,[239] Quakerism,[240] Swedenborgism.[241] The pupil takes the  same delight in subordinating everything to the new terminology, as a  girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons  thereby. It will happen for a time, that the pupil will find his  intellectual power has grown by the study of his master's mind. But in  all unbalanced minds, the classification is idolized, passes for the  end, and not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that the walls of the  system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the  universe; the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their  master built. They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to  see,--how you can see; \"It must be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16653"],[0,"Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (#16)"],[1,"barley or wheat. There is no reason for supposing that they thought  otherwise. The early folks based their theories on the accumulated  knowledge of their age. They knew nothing regarding the composition of  water or the atmosphere, of the cause of thunder and lightning, or of  the chemical changes effected in soils by the action of bacteria. They  attributed all natural phenomena to the operations of spirits or gods.  In believing that certain demons caused certain diseases, they may be  said to have achieved distinct progress, for they anticipated the germ  theory. They made discoveries, too, which have been approved and  elaborated in later times when they lit sacred fires, bathed in sacred  waters, and used oils and herbs to charm away spirits of pestilence.  Indeed, many folk cures, which were originally associated with magical  ceremonies, are still practised in our own day. They were found to be  effective by early observers, although they were unable to explain why  and how cures were accomplished, like modern scientific investigators.    In peopling the Universe with spirits, the Babylonians, like other  ancient folks, betrayed that tendency to symbolize everything which  has ever appealed to the human mind. Our painters and poets and  sculptors are greatest when they symbolize their ideals and ideas and  impressions, and by so doing make us respond to their moods. Their  \"beauty and their terror are sublime\". But what may seem poetic to us,  was invariably a grim reality to the Babylonians. The statue or  picture was not merely a work of art but a manifestation of the god or  demon. As has been said, they believed that the spirit of the god  inhabited the idol; the frown of the brazen image was the frown of the  wicked demon. They entertained as much dread of the winged and  human-headed bulls guarding the entrance to the royal palace as do  some of the Arab workmen who, in our own day, assist excavators to  rescue them from sandy mounds in which they have been hidden for long  centuries.    When an idol was carried away from a city by an invading army, it was  believed that the god himself had been taken prisoner, and was  therefore unable any longer to help his people.    In the early stages of Sumerian culture, the gods and goddesses who  formed groups were indistinguishable from demons. They were vaguely  defined, and had changing shapes. When attempts were made to depict  them they were represented in many varying forms. Some were winged  bulls or lions with human heads; others had even more remarkable  composite forms. The \"dragon of Babylon\", for instance, which was  portrayed on walls of temples, had a serpent's head, a body covered  with scales, the fore legs of a lion, hind legs of an eagle, and a  long wriggling serpentine tail. Ea had several monster forms. The  following description of one of these is repulsive enough:--        The head is the head of a serpent,      From his nostrils mucus trickles,      His mouth is beslavered with water;      The ears are like those of a basilisk,      His horns are twisted into three curls,      He wears a veil in his head band,      The body is a suh-fish full of stars,      The base of his feet are claws,      The sole of his foot has no heel,      His name is Sassu-wunnu,      A sea monster, a form of Ea.                _R.C. Thompson's Translation._[79]    Even after the gods were given beneficent attributes to reflect the  growth of culture, and were humanized, they still retained many of  their savage characteristics. Bel Enlil and his fierce son, Nergal,  were destroyers of mankind; the storm god desolated the land; the sky  god deluged it with rain; the sea raged furiously, ever hungering for  human victims; the burning sun struck down its victims; and the floods  played havoc with the dykes and houses of human beings. In Egypt the  sun god Ra was similarly a \"producer of calamity\", the composite  monster god Sokar was \"the lord of fear\".[80] Osiris in prehistoric  times had been \"a dangerous god\", and some of the Pharaohs sought  protection against him in the charms inscribed in their tombs.[81] The  Indian Shiva, \"the Destroyer\", in the old religious poems has also  primitive attributes of like character.    The Sumerian gods never lost their connection with the early spirit  groups. These continued to be represented by their attendants, who  executed a deity's stern and vengeful decrees. In one of the  Babylonian charms the demons are referred to as \"the spleen of the  gods\"--the symbols of their wrathful emotions and vengeful desires.  Bel Enlil, the air and earth god, was served by the demons of disease,  \"the beloved sons of Bel\", which issued from the Underworld to attack  mankind. Nergal, the sulky and ill-tempered lord of death and  destruction, who never lost his demoniac character, swept over the  land, followed by the spirits of pestilence, sunstroke, weariness, and  destruction. Anu, the sky god, had \"spawned\" at creation the demons of  cold and rain and darkness. Even Ea and his consort, Damkina, were  served by groups of devils and giants, which preyed upon mankind in  bleak and desolate places when night fell. In the ocean home of Ea  were bred the \"seven evil spirits\" of tempest--the gaping dragon, the  leopard which preyed upon children, the great Beast, the terrible  serpent, &c.    In Indian mythology Indra was similarly followed by the stormy Maruts,  and fierce Rudra by the tempestuous Rudras. In Teutonic mythology Odin  is the \"Wild Huntsman in the Raging Host\". In Greek mythology the  ocean furies attend upon fickle Poseidon. Other examples of this kind  could be multiplied.    As we have seen (Chapter II) the earliest group of Babylonian deities  consisted probably of four pairs of gods and goddesses as in Egypt.  The first pair was Apsu-Rishtu and Tiamat, who personified the  primordial deep. Now the elder deities in most mythologies--the  \"grandsires\" and \"grandmothers\" and \"fathers\" and \"mothers\"--are ever  the most powerful and most vengeful. They appear to represent  primitive \"layers\" of savage thought. The Greek Cronos devours even  his own children, and, as the late Andrew Lang has shown, there are  many parallels to this myth among primitive peoples in various parts  of the world.    Lang regarded the Greek survival as an example of \"the conservatism of  the religious instinct\".[82] The grandmother of the Teutonic deity Tyr  was a fierce giantess with nine hundred heads; his father was an enemy  of the gods. In Scotland the hag-mother of winter and storm and  darkness is the enemy of growth and all life, and she raises storms to  stop the grass growing, to slay young animals, and prevent the union  of her son with his fair bride. Similarly the Babylonian chaos  spirits, Apsu and Tiamat, the father and mother of the gods, resolve  to destroy their offspring, because they begin to set the Universe in  order. Tiamat, the female dragon, is more powerful than her husband  Apsu, who is slain by his son Ea. She summons to her aid the gods of  evil, and creates also a brood of monsters--serpents, dragons, vipers,  fish men, raging hounds, &c.--so as to bring about universal and  enduring confusion and evil. Not until she is destroyed can the  beneficent gods establish law and order and make the earth habitable  and beautiful.    But although Tiamat was slain, the everlasting battle between the  forces of good and evil was ever waged in the Babylonian world.  Certain evil spirits were let loose at certain periods, and they  strove to accomplish the destruction of mankind and his works. These  invisible enemies were either charmed away by performing magical  ceremonies, or by invoking the gods to thwart them and bind them.    Other spirits inhabited the bodies of animals and were ever hovering  near. The ghosts of the dead and male and female demons were birds,  like the birds of Fate which sang to Siegfried. When the owl raised  its melancholy voice in the darkness the listener heard the spirit of  a departed mother crying for her child. Ghosts and evil spirits  wandered through the streets in darkness; they haunted empty houses;  they fluttered through the evening air as bats; they hastened, moaning  dismally, across barren wastes searching for food or lay in wait for  travellers; they came as roaring lions and howling jackals, hungering  for human flesh. The \"shedu\" was a destructive bull which might slay  man wantonly or as a protector of temples. Of like character was the  \"lamassu\", depicted as a winged bull with human head, the protector of  palaces; the \"alu\" was a bull-like demon of tempest, and there were  also many composite, distorted, or formless monsters which were  vaguely termed \"seizers\" or \"overthrowers\", the Semitic \"labashu\" and  \"ach-chazu\", the Sumerian \"dimmea\" and \"dimme-kur\". A dialectic form  of \"gallu\" or devil was \"mulla\". Professor Pinches thinks it not  improbable that \"mulla\" may be connected with the word \"mula\", meaning  \"star\", and suggests that it referred to a \"will-o'-the-wisp\".[83] In  these islands, according to an old rhyme,        Some call him Robin Good-fellow,        Hob-goblin, or mad Crisp,      And some againe doe tearme him oft        By name of Will the Wisp.    Other names are \"Kitty\", \"Peg\", and \"Jack with a lantern\". \"Poor  Robin\" sang:        I should indeed as soon expect      That Peg-a-lantern would direct      Me straightway home on misty night      As wand'ring stars, quite out of sight.    In Shakespeare's _Tempest_[84] a sailor exclaims: \"Your fairy, which,  you say, is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the  Jack with us\". Dr. Johnson commented that the reference was to \"Jack  with a lantern\". Milton wrote also of the \"wandering fire\",        Which oft, they say, some evil spirit attends,      Hovering and blazing with delusive light,      Misleads th' amaz'd night wand'rer from his way      To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or"]]]
