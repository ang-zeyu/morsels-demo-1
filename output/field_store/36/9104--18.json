Buonaparte had skilfully disposed his cannon to bear on the royalist  columns that threatened the streets north of the Tuileries. But for  some time the two parties stood face to face, seeking to cajole or  intimidate one another. As the autumn afternoon waned, shots were  fired from some houses near the church of St. Roch, where the  malcontents had their headquarters.[33] At once the streets became the  scene of a furious fight; furious but unequal; for Buonaparte's cannon  tore away the heads of the malcontent columns. In vain did the  royalists pour in their volleys from behind barricades, or from the  neighbouring houses: finally they retreated on the barricaded church,  or fled down the Rue St. Honore. Meanwhile their bands from across the  river, 5,000 strong, were filing across the bridges, and menaced the  Tuileries from that side, until here also they melted away before the  grapeshot and musketry poured into their front and flank. By six  o'clock the conflict was over. The fight presents few, if any,  incidents which are authentic. The well-known engraving of Helman,  which shows Buonaparte directing the storming of the church of St.  Roch is unfortunately quite incorrect. He was not engaged there, but  in the streets further east: the church was not stormed: the  malcontents held it all through the night, and quietly surrendered it  next morning.    Such was the great day of Vendemiaire. It cost the lives of about two  hundred on each side; at least, that is the usual estimate, which  seems somewhat incongruous with the stories of fusillading and  cannonading at close quarters, until we remember that it is the custom  of memoir-writers and newspaper editors to trick out the details of a  fight, and in the case of civil warfare to minimise the bloodshed.  Certainly the Convention acted with clemency in the hour of victory:  two only of the rebel leaders were put to death; and it is pleasing to  remember that when Menou was charged with treachery, Buonaparte used  his influence to procure his freedom.    Bourrienne states that in his later days the victor deeply regretted  his action in this day of Vendemiaire. The assertion seems  incredible. The \"whiff of grapeshot\" crushed a movement which could  have led only to present anarchy, and probably would have brought  France back to royalism of an odious type. It taught a severe lesson  to a fickle populace which, according to Mme. de Stael, was hungering  for the spoils of place as much as for any political object. Of all  the events of his post-Corsican life, Buonaparte need surely never  have felt compunctions for Vendemiaire.[34]    After four signal reverses in his career, he now enters on a path  strewn with glories. The first reward for his signal services to the  Republic was his appointment to be second in command of the army of  the interior; and when Barras resigned the first command, he took that  responsible post. But more brilliant honours were soon to follow, the  first of a social character, the second purely military.    Buonaparte had already appeared timidly and awkwardly at the _salon_  of the voluptuous Barras, where the fair but frail Madame  Tallien--Notre Dame de Thermidor she was styled--dazzled Parisian  society by her classic features and the uncinctured grace of her  attire. There he reappeared, not in the threadbare uniform that had  attracted the giggling notice of that giddy throng, but as the lion of  the society which his talents had saved. His previous attempts to gain  the hand of a lady had been unsuccessful. He had been refused, first  by Mlle. Clary, sister of his brother Joseph's wife, and quite  recently by Madame Permon. Indeed, the scarecrow young officer had not  been a brilliant match. But now he saw at that _salon_ a charming  widow, Josephine de Beauharnais, whose husband had perished in the  Terror. The ardour of his southern temperament, long repressed by his  privations, speedily rekindles in her presence: his stiff, awkward  manners thaw under her smiles: his silence vanishes when she praises  his military gifts: he admires her tact, her sympathy, her beauty: he  determines to marry her. The lady, on her part, seems to have been  somewhat terrified by her uncanny wooer: she comments questioningly on  his \"violent tenderness almost amounting to frenzy\": she notes  uneasily his \"keen inexplicable gaze which imposes even on our  Directors\": How would this eager nature, this masterful energy,  consort with her own \"Creole nonchalance\"? She did well to ask herself  whether the general's almost volcanic passion would not soon exhaust  itself, and turn from her own fading charms to those of women who  were his equals in age. Besides, when she frankly asked her own heart,  she found that she loved him not: she only admired him. Her chief  consolation was that if she married him, her friend Barras would help  to gain for Buonaparte the command of the Army of Italy. The advice of  Barras undoubtedly helped to still the questioning surmises of  Josephine; and the wedding was celebrated, as a civil contract, on  March 9th, 1796. With a pardonable coquetry, the bride entered her age  on the register as four years less than the thirty-four which had  passed over her: while her husband, desiring still further to lessen  the disparity, entered his date of birth as 1768.    A fortnight before the wedding, he had been appointed to command the  Army of Italy: and after a honeymoon of two days at Paris, he left his  bride to take up his new military duties. Clearly, then, there was  some connection between this brilliant fortune and his espousal of  Josephine. But the assertion that this command was the \"dowry\" offered  by Barras to the somewhat reluctant bride is more piquant than  correct. That the brilliance of Buonaparte's prospects finally  dissipated her scruples may be frankly admitted. But the appointment  to a command of a French army did not rest with Barras. He was only  one of the five Directors who now decided the chief details of  administration. His colleagues were Letourneur, Rewbell, La  Reveilliere-Lepeaux, and the great Carnot; and, as a matter of fact,  it was the last-named who chiefly decided the appointment in question.    He had seen and pondered over the plan of campaign which Buonaparte  had designed for the Army of Italy; and the vigour of the conception,  the masterly appreciation of topographical details which it displayed,  and the trenchant energy of its style had struck conviction to his  strategic genius. Buonaparte owed his command, not to a backstairs  intrigue, as was currently believed in the army, but rather to his own  commanding powers. While serving with the Army of Italy in 1794, he  had carefully studied the coast-line and the passes leading inland;  and, according to the well-known savant, Volney, the young officer,  shortly after his release from imprisonment, sketched out to him and  to a Commissioner of the Convention the details of the very plan of  campaign which was to carry him victoriously from the Genoese Riviera  into the heart of Austria.[35] While describing this masterpiece of  strategy, says Volney, Buonaparte spoke as if inspired. We can fancy  the wasted form dilating with a sense of power, the thin sallow cheeks  aglow with enthusiasm, the hawk-like eyes flashing at the sight of the  helpless Imperial quarry, as he pointed out on the map of Piedmont and  Lombardy the features which would favour a dashing invader and carry  him to the very gates of Vienna. The splendours of the Imperial Court  at the Tuileries seem tawdry and insipid when compared with the  intellectual grandeur which lit up that humble lodging at Nice with  the first rays that heralded the dawn of Italian liberation.    With the fuller knowledge which he had recently acquired, he now in  January, 1796, elaborated this plan of campaign, so that it at once  gained Carnot's admiration. The Directors forwarded it to General  Scherer, who was in command of the Army of Italy, but promptly  received the \"brutal\" reply that the man who had drafted the plan  ought to come and carry it out. Long dissatisfied with Scherer's  inactivity and constant complaints, the Directory now took him at his  word, and replaced him by Buonaparte. Such is the truth about  Buonaparte's appointment to the Army of Italy.    To Nice, then, the young general set out (March 21st) accompanied, or  speedily followed, by his faithful friends, Marmont and Junot, as well  as by other officers of whose energy he was assured, Berthier, Murat,  and Duroc. How much had happened since the early summer of 1795, when  he had barely the means to pay his way to Paris! A sure instinct had  drawn him to that hot-bed of intrigues. He had played a desperate  game, risking his commission in order that he might keep in close  touch with the central authority. His reward for this almost  superhuman confidence in his own powers was correspondingly great; and  now, though he knew nothing of the handling of cavalry and infantry  save from books, he determined to lead the Army of Italy to a series  of conquests that would rival those of Caesar. In presence of a will so  stubborn and genius so fervid, what wonder that a friend prophesied  that his halting-place would be either the throne or the scaffold?           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER V    THE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN    (1796)      In the personality of Napoleon nothing is more remarkable than the  combination of gifts which in most natures are mutually exclusive; his  instincts were both political and military; his survey of a land took  in not only the geographical environment but also the material welfare  of the people. Facts, which his foes ignored, offered a firm fulcrum  for the leverage of his will: and their political edifice or their  military policy crumbled to ruin under an assault planned with  consummate skill and pressed home with relentless force.

One who can read expression, perceives at a glance the difference between  friendliness and polite aloofness. When a lady is unusually silent,  strictly impersonal in conversation, and entirely unapproachable,  something is not to her liking. The question is, what? Or usually, whom?  The greatest blunder possible would be to ask her what the matter is. The  cause of annoyance is probably that she finds someone distasteful and it  should not be hard for one whose faculties are not asleep to discover the  offender and if possible separate them, or at least never ask them  together again.          CHAPTER X    CARDS AND VISITS      =USEFULNESS OF CARDS=    Who was it that said--in the Victorian era probably, and a man of  course--\"The only mechanical tool ever needed by a woman is a hair-pin\"?  He might have added that with a hair-pin and a visiting card, she is ready  to meet most emergencies.    Although the principal use of a visiting card, at least the one for which  it was originally invented--to be left as an evidence of one person's  presence at the house of another--is going gradually out of ardent favor  in fashionable circles, its usefulness seems to keep a nicely adjusted  balance. In New York, for instance, the visiting card has entirely taken  the place of the written note of invitation to informal parties of every  description. Messages of condolence or congratulation are written on it;  it is used as an endorsement in the giving of an order; it is even tacked  on the outside of express boxes. The only employment of it which is not as  flourishing as formerly is its being left in quantities and with frequency  at the doors of acquaintances. This will be explained further on.      =A CARD'S SIZE AND ENGRAVING=    The card of a lady is usually from about 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 inches wide, by 2  to 2-3/4 inches high, but there is no fixed rule. The card of a young girl  is smaller and more nearly square in shape. (About 2 inches high by 2-1/2  or 2-5/8 inches long, depending upon the length of the name.) Young girls  use smaller cards than older ladies. A gentleman's card is long and  narrow, from 2-7/8 to 3-1/4 inches long, and from 1-1/4 to 1-5/8 inches  high. All visiting cards are engraved on white unglazed bristol board,  which may be of medium thickness or thin, as one fancies. A few years ago  there was a fad for cards as thin as writing paper, but one seldom sees  them in America now. The advantage of a thin card is that a greater  quantity may be carried easily.    The engraving most in use to-day is shaded block. Script is seldom seen,  but it is always good form and so is plain block, but with the exception  of old English all ornate lettering should be avoided. All people who live  in cities should have the address in the lower right corner, engraved in  smaller letters than the name. In the country, addresses are not  important, as every one knows where every one else lives. People who have  town and country houses usually have separate cards, though not  necessarily a separate plate.      =ECONOMICAL ENGRAVING=    The economically inclined can have several varieties of cards printed from  one plate. The cards would vary somewhat in size in order to \"center\" the  wording.    Example:    The plate:        Mr. and Mrs. Gilding              Miss Gilding                            00 FIFTH AVENUE                          GOLDEN HALL    may be printed.    Miss Gilding's name should never appear on a card with both her mother's  and father's, so her name being out of line under the \"Mr. and Mrs.\"  engraving makes no difference.    or        Mr. and Mrs. Gilding                     GOLDEN HALL      or        Mrs. Gilding           Miss Gilding                     00 FIFTH AVENUE    or        Mrs. Gilding                      GOLDEN HALL    The personal card is in a measure an index of one's character. A fantastic  or garish note in the type effect, in the quality or shape of the card,  betrays a lack of taste in the owner of the card.    It is not customary for a married man to have a club address on his card,  and it would be serviceable only in giving a card of introduction to a  business acquaintance, under social rather than business circumstances, or  in paying a formal call upon a political or business associate. Unmarried  men often use no other address than that of a club; especially if they  live in bachelor's quarters, but young men who live at home use their home  address.      =CORRECT NAMES AND TITLES=    To be impeccably correct, initials should not be engraved on a visiting  card. A gentleman's card should read: Mr. John Hunter Titherington Smith,  but since names are sometimes awkwardly long, and it is the American  custom to cling to each and every one given in baptism, he asserts his  possessions by representing each one with an initial, and engraves his  cards Mr. John H.T. Smith, or Mr. J.H. Titherington Smith, as suits his  fancy. So, although, according to high authorities, he should drop a name  or two and be Mr. Hunter Smith, or Mr. Titherington Smith, it is very  likely that to the end of time the American man, and necessarily his wife,  who must use the name as he does, will go on cherishing initials.    And a widow no less than a married woman should always continue to use her  husband's Christian name, or his name and another initial, engraved on her  cards. She is Mrs. John Hunter Titherington Smith, or, to compromise, Mrs.  J.H. Titherington Smith, but she is _never_ Mrs. Sarah Smith; at least not  anywhere in good society. In business and in legal matters a woman is  necessarily addressed by her own Christian name, because she uses it in  her signature. But no one should ever address an envelope, except from a  bank or a lawyer's office, \"Mrs. Sarah Smith.\" When a widow's son, who has  the name of his father, marries, the widow has Sr. added to her own name,  or if she is the \"head\" of the family, she very often omits all Christian  names, and has her card engraved \"Mrs. Smith,\" and the son's wife calls  herself Mrs. John Hunter Smith. Smith is not a very good name as an  example, since no one could very well claim the distinction of being _the_  Mrs. Smith. It, however, illustrates the point.    For the daughter-in-law to continue to use a card with Jr. on it when her  husband no longer uses Jr. on his, is a mistake made by many people. A  wife always bears the name of her husband. To have a man and his mother  use cards engraved respectively Mr. J.H. Smith and Mrs. J.H. Smith and the  son's wife a card engraved Mrs. J.H. Smith, Jr., would announce to  whomever the three cards were left upon, that Mr. and Mrs. Smith and  _their_ daughter-in-law had called.    The cards of a young girl after she is sixteen have always \"Miss\" before  her name, which must be her real and never a nick-name: Miss Sarah Smith,  not Miss Sally Smith.    The fact that a man's name has \"Jr.\" added at the end in no way takes the  place of \"Mr.\" His card should be engraved Mr. John Hunter Smith, Jr., and  his wife's Mrs. John Hunter Smith, Jr. Some people have the \"Jr.\" written  out, \"junior.\" It is not spelled with a capital J if written in full.    A boy puts Mr. on his cards when he leaves school, though many use cards  without Mr. on them while in college. A doctor, or a judge, or a minister,  or a military officer have their cards engraved with the abbreviation of  their title: Dr. Henry Gordon; Judge Horace Rush; The Rev. William Goode;  Col. Thomas Doyle.    The double card reads: Dr. and Mrs. Henry Gordon; Hon. and Mrs., etc.    A woman who has divorced her husband retains the legal as well as the  social right to use her husband's full name, in New York State at least.  Usually she prefers, if her name was Alice Green, to call herself Mrs.  Green Smith; not Mrs. Alice Smith, and on no account Mrs. Alice  Green--unless she wishes to give the impression that she was the guilty  one in the divorce.      =CHILDREN'S CARDS=    That very little children should have visiting cards is not so \"silly\" as  might at first thought be supposed. To acquire perfect manners, and those  graces of deportment that Lord Chesterfield so ardently tried to instil  into his son, training can not begin early enough, since it is through  lifelong familiarity with the niceties of etiquette that much of the  distinction of those to the manner born is acquired.    Many mothers think it good training for children to have their own cards,  which they are taught not so much to leave upon each other after  \"parties,\" as to send with gifts upon various occasions.    At the rehearsal of a wedding, the tiny twin flower girls came carrying  their wedding present for the bride between them, to which they had  themselves attached their own small visiting cards. One card was bordered  and engraved in pink, and the other bordered and engraved in blue, and the  address on each read \"_Chez Maman_.\"    And in going to see a new baby cousin each brought a small 1830 bouquet,  and sent to their aunt their cards, on which, after seeing the baby, one  had printed \"He is very little,\" and the other, \"It has a red face.\" This  shows that if modern society believes in beginning social training in the  nursery, it does not believe in hampering a child's natural expression.      =SPECIAL CARDS AND WHEN TO USE THEM=    The double card, reading Mr. and Mrs., is sent with a wedding present, or  with flowers to a funeral, or with flowers to a debutante, and is also  used in paying formal visits.    The card on which a debutante's name is engraved under that of her mother,  is used most frequently when no coming-out entertainment has been given  for the daughter. Her name on her mother's card announces, wherever it is  left, that the daughter is \"grown\" and \"eligible\" for invitations. In the  same way a mother may leave her son's card with her own upon any of her  own friends--especially upon those likely to entertain for young"]]]
