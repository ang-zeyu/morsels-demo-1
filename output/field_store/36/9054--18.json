Two comic operas  appeared, \"The Dumb Girl of the Forest,\" and \"Peter Schmoll and his  Neighbors.\" They were both performed, but neither made a hit.    When Carl was seventeen, the father decided he should go to Vienna,  for there he would meet all the great musicians of the time. The  boy was at the most impressionable age: he was lively, witty, with  pleasant manners and amiable disposition; he soon became a favorite in  the highest musical circles. It was a gay life and the inexperienced  youth yielded to its allurements. In the meantime he did some serious  studying under the famous Abbe Vogler. The following year the Abbe  recommended him to the conductorship of the Breslau Opera House. This  was a very difficult post for a boy of eighteen, and he encountered  much jealousy and opposition from the older musicians, who did not  relish finding themselves under the leadership of such a youth. A year  served to disgust him with the work and he resigned. During the year  he had found time to compose most of his opera \"Rubezahl.\"    For the next few years there were many \"ups and downs\" in Carl's life.  From Breslau he went to Carlsruhe, and entered the service of Prince  Eugene. For about a year he was a brilliant figure at the Court. Then  war clouds gathered and the gay Court life came to an end. Music  under the present conditions could no longer support him, as the whole  social state of Germany had altered. The young composer was forced to  earn his livelihood in some way, and now became private secretary to  Prince Ludwig of Wurtemburg, whose Court was held at Stuttgart. The  gay, dissolute life at the Court was full of temptation for our young  composer, yet he found considerable time for composition; his opera  \"Sylvana\" was the result, besides several smaller things. During the  Stuttgart period, his finances became so low, that on one occasion he  had to spend several days in prison for debt. Determined to recruit  his fortunes, he began traveling to other towns to make known his art.  In Mannheim, Darmstadt and Baden, he gave concerts, bringing out  in each place some of his newer pieces, and earning enough at each  concert to last a few weeks, when another concert would keep the wolf  from the door a little longer.    In 1810, when he was twenty-four, he finished his pretty opera \"Abu  Hassan,\" which, on the suggestion of his venerable master, Vogler,  he dedicated to the Grand Duke. The Duke accepted the dedication with  evident pleasure, and sent Carl a purse of gold, in value about two  hundred dollars. The opera was performed on February 6, 1811, and its  reception was very gratifying to the composer. The Grand Duke took one  hundred and twenty tickets and the performance netted over two hundred  florins clear profit. It was after this that Carl Maria went on a tour  of the principal German cities and gave concerts in Munich, Prague,  Berlin, Dresden and other places. He was everywhere welcomed, his  talents and charming manners winning friends everywhere. Especially in  Prague he found the highest and noblest aristocracy ready to bid him  welcome.    Weber paid a visit to Liebich, director of the Prague theater, almost  as soon as he arrived in town. The invalid director greeted him  warmly.    \"So, you are _the_ Weber! I suppose you want me to buy your operas.  One fills an evening, the other doesn't. Very well, I will give  fifteen hundred florins for the two. Is it a bargain?\" Weber accepted,  and promised to return the next spring to conduct the operas. He kept  his promise, and the result was much better than he ever dreamed. For  beyond the performance of his operas, he was offered the post of music  director of the Prague theater, which post was just then vacant.  The salary was two thousand florins, with a benefit concert at a  guaranteed sum of one thousand more, and three months leave of absence  every year. This assured sum gave young Weber the chance of paying his  debts and starting afresh, which, he writes \"was a delight to him.\"    The composer now threw himself heart and soul into improving the  orchestra placed in his charge. Before long he had drilled it to a  high state of excellence. Many new operas were put on the stage in  quick succession. Thus Weber worked on with great industry for three  years. The success he achieved created enemies, and perhaps because of  intrigues, envy and ill feeling which had arisen, he resigned his  post in 1816. The three years in Prague had been fruitful in new  compositions. Several fine piano sonatas, a set of \"National Songs,\"  and the Cantata, \"Kampf und Sieg,\" (Struggle and Victory). This last  work soon became known all over Germany and made the gifted young  composer very popular. During this period Weber became engaged to  Caroline Brandt, a charming singer, who created the title role in his  opera of \"Sylvana.\"    Weber had many kind, influential friends in Prague, who admired his  zeal and efficiency as music director. One of them, Count Vitzhum, did  all he could to secure Weber for Dresden. On Christmas morning, 1816,  he received the appointment. He wrote to Caroline: \"Long did I look on  Count Vitzhum's letter without daring to open it. Did it contain joy  or sorrow? At length I took courage and broke the seal. It was joy!  I am Capellmeister to his Majesty the King of Saxony. I must now rig  myself out in true Court style. Perhaps I ought to wear a pigtail to  please the Dresdeners. What do you say? I ought at least to have an  extra kiss from you for this good news.\"    He went to Dresden, and at first looked over the situation. On nearer  view the prospect was not as bright as it had appeared at first. There  was a rival faction, strongly opposed to his plans for the promotion  of German opera. There had never been anything tolerated at Dresden  but Italian opera, and there were many talented Italian singers to  interpret them. Weber was encouraged by a new national spirit, which  he felt would favor German opera, and was determined to conquer at  all costs. He finally succeeded, for, as he wrote to a friend, \"The  Italians have moved heaven, earth and hell also, to swallow up the  whole German opera and its promoter. But they have found in me a  precious tough morsel; I am not easily swallowed.\" It was the same  kind of fight that Handel waged in England, and that Gluck fought  against the Piccinists.    \"Joseph and his Brethren,\" by Mehul, was the first opera to be taken  up by the new conductor. He drilled the orchestra much more carefully  than they had been accustomed, and while, in the beginning, some were  sulky at the strictness they were subjected to, yet they finally saw  the justice of it and at last took pride in doing their work well.  \"Joseph\" was brought out January 30, 1817. The King and Court were  present, and everything passed off well, indeed remarkably well. His  majesty was greatly pleased and did not cough once during the whole  performance, as he used to do when things did not go to suit him.    In spite of Italian opposition which still continued, Weber's efforts  to establish German opera kept right on, until at last it became a  State institution, and the composer was appointed musical director for  life. With this bright prospect in view he was able to wed his beloved  Caroline. They were married on November 4. A quotation from his diary  shows the talented musician had become a serious, earnest man. \"May  God bless our union, and grant me strength and power to make my  beloved Lina as happy and contented as my inmost heart would desire.  May His mercy lead me in all things.\"    Weber was now entering the most prolific and brilliant period of his  life. His music became richer, more noble and beautiful. The happy  union with Caroline seemed to put new life and energy into him, and as  a result his works became quickly known all over Europe. His mind  was literally teeming with original themes, which crowded each other,  struggling to be expressed. First there was the \"Mass in E flat,\" a  beautiful, original work; then a festal Cantata, \"Nature and Love,\"  written to celebrate the Queen of Saxony's birthday. After this the  \"Jubilee Cantata,\" composed to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary  of the reign of Augustus, of Saxony. The Italian faction prevented a  performance of the whole work, and only the Overture was given.  When the entire work was heard it made a great sensation. Now came a  Jubilee Mass and some piano pieces, among them the charming and famous  \"Invitation to the Dance,\" with which every one is familiar. While  writing all these works, the composer was busy with one of his  greatest operas, \"Der Freischuetz.\" On May 8, 1820, a hundred years  ago, the score of \"Der Freischuetz,\" was sent to the director of the  Berlin theater, and directly put in rehearsal. The rehearsals had not  proceeded very far before Weber, the tireless ceaseless worker, had  finished his important opera, \"Preciosa,\" which was also despatched to  Berlin. \"Preciosa\" was brought out before \"Der Freischuetz,\" which was  just as it should be, as the public needed to be educated up to the  \"Freischuetz\" music. \"Preciosa\" was founded on a Spanish story, \"The  Gypsy of Madrid,\" and Weber has written for it some of his most  charming melodies, full of Spanish color, life and vivacity. Nowadays  the opera is neglected, but we often hear the overture. It is to be  noted that the overtures to each of Weber's operas contain the leading  themes and melodies of the operas themselves, showing with what skill  the artist wrought. When Weber's widow presented the original score  of \"Der Freischuetz\" to the Royal Library in Berlin, it was found there  was not a single erasure or correction in the whole work.    On June 18, 1821, came the first performance of Weber's masterpiece,  \"Der Freischuetz.\" The theater was beseiged for hours by eager crowds,  and when the doors were at last opened, there was a grand rush to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13300"],[0,"The Doctrine and Practice of Yoga (#16)"],[1,"seconds.

Take them several times in the day. Never exercise immediately  after a meal or before it. Do not try to force development as you will  be apt to suffer from re-action. Slow and steady wins the race. Gentle  and persistent exercises are advisable. That will lead to permanent  development.      EFFECT OF MIND AND BODY.    It has been proved conclusively even on the physical plane that a  \"a Man thinketh in his heart so is he.\" The great thing to avoid is Fear  and Worry thoughts. These and all other undesirable thoughts are due  to bad health partially but it is even a greater truth that physical  degeneration is due to bad thinking. Fear affects the heart. During  epidemics such as plague, cholera, etc., you generally first project the  deadly germs of Fear-Thoughts upon yourself and thus by weakening your  mind you weaken your body and expose yourself to disease influence.  Again, if you have some hereditary disease and if you accept adverse  suggestions from ignorant people and keep telling yourself that such and  such a disease has taken shelter in you and your body as its \"fixed  abode\" you simply hasten your own end. The body and mind are  interrelated. Thoughts materialize themselves in your body. You should  get as far away from the idea of disease and old age and weaknesses as  possible and hold the health-thoughts steadily before your mind. The only  way in which to be quite immune from Disease is to Deny the Power of  Disease on yourself. Say \"I cannot be ill,\" \"I will not admit disease.\"  Health and strength are in the unyielding will. De-hypnotise yourself  of that superstition that God sends disease. Your body is yours to  control and keep healthy. God will give you--(He has already given you  rather)--the Power to control your body. Remember always; you alone can  save yourself. All Power and Wisdom are potentially resident in you.  Have confidence and set that thing in motion, exercise it constantly and  persistently and it shall grow and unfold. God is in you and you are in  God. When you pray you are simply, although often unconsciously, helping  that Latent Power to uncoil itself. Remember again: God will grant you  the opportunity, the means, the wisdom, the ability to accomplish a  thing, but You Shall Have to do the work yourself. Hence, you see, the  illumined mind is quite necessary for perfect health. Get rid of all weak  thoughts. Have a strong mind. Remember lastly:      MIND ACTS UPON BODY IN ALL WAYS.    Make your mind positive to your body. I have told you how to do so.  Physical exercise plus Mental Exercise will put you on the road to  Power and Poise. And side by side with this follow health-laws. But  bear in mind that if you assert your power on your mind and body  confidentially, they cannot but obey your commands. The body has an  intelligence of its own. This intelligence knows its work perfectly. It  is what you call Instinct. It digests your meals; assimilates and  eliminates; repairs wastes; works the heart and controls the circulation;  heals wounds and presides over all other natural and involuntary  processes in the body. This Instinctive mind knows its work perfectly.  But, mark you, this intelligence in the cells and nerve-centres of your  body is negative to the Central Intelligence in the brain--the  controlling centre--the \"I Am\" and is affected by suggestions, beliefs  and thoughts in your brain. All you have got to do is to avoid projecting  negative thoughts from your mind and let it alone. But suppose you have  by violation of the Laws of Nature disturbed the action of the  Instinctive Mind, disease results. Disease is simply the effect of nature  to throw off unnatural conditions and re-assert natural conditions. In  such a case all you have got to do is to re-establish natural states. You  can do so by simply increasing the general vitality of the body and by  changing your Mental Attitude. For instance, if you somehow or other have  accepted the \"belief\" that your stomach is weak or your heart is weak or  your liver is slow or your circulation is bad or your vitality is low,  etc., your instinctive Mind will take up your Beliefs and work them out  in no time physically. The Instinctive Mind--which is the same as the  sub-conscious Mind working in the body--_never reasons_. It is on the  plane of Automatism. Therefore, if you have done any such negative  thinking your first step is to wipe out these noxious mental weeds by the  Positive Denial. Say \"No, No, No, my body is strong; my stomach is  strong, my heart is strong, etc.\" In this form of suggestion you use  positive Denial as well as Positive Affirmation. The former is  destructive of evil if rightly applied, the latter is constructive of  good. Belief and confident expectation are mighty forces. Be sure you  apply them wisely. The power of mind over matter is supreme and a Proven  Reality.      RESERVE FORCE.    Here I should like to draw your attention to the Reserve Power existing  in your body. Of course there are soul-powers existing potentially  within YOU which leap into brilliant expression as you succeed in  developing and expanding your brain to a state of perfect responsiveness  to the touch of your will. For really and truly your will, forming as it  does the divine part of yourself, is always strong and must unfold \"as a  rose\" by exercising itself, in the field of matter, force and mind;--all  of which are subordinate to YOU and the real aim of human evolution is  actually to place in your hands the wand of power.    What is within your body is sure to find its correspondent outside in  Nature. Control nature inside and you will move as a master out in this  universe.    Now without going into details let me tell you--if you do not know it  already--that mind is the finest form of matter, and matter the grossest  form of mind, and there is a constant interaction between the two poles.  But since mind represents the positive end and matter the negative, the  former can dominate the latter. You can evoke states of consciousness by  applying stimulus to the periphery and again mental states evoke  corresponding vibrations in the cellular life of body and brain.    Hence you see your mind controls and forms your body. Also your body  reacts upon your brain and affects that part of your mind which has to  operate through the brain, which is matter pure and simple. So to keep  aright the polarities of your brain and body a constant adjustment of  forces is needed and thus you can establish POISE.    In order always to be in a state of perfect health two things are  necessary. Deny the power of disease over yourself. In the unyielding  will is health. In the weak, vacillating, fearful mind is disease and  death. At the same time always be in perfect magnetic trim with the  physical laws of health. A knowledge of the latter and the ascension of a  fearless mental attitude will open up hitherto unrecognised channels of  physical and mental expression. Physiological researches have led sincere  investigators to the inevitable conclusion that there is subtle, refined,  dynamic substance, a reality that binds up the reorganization, causes  growth, vitality and motion; repairs injuries; makes up losses; overcomes  and cures diseases. Von Helment called it \"Archeus\"; Stahl called it  \"Anima;\" Whytt called it the \"sentiment principle;\" Dr. Cullen called it  \"Caloric;\" Dr. Darwin called it \"Sensorial energy\"; Rush called it  \"Occult cause;\" and many other names such as \"Vital Principle,\" \"Living  power,\" \"Conservative Power,\" \"Odic Force,\" etc., etc., have been given  to it. We of India have recognised it and devised Yoga methods for  controlling it; we call it Prana and only in India do you come across men  who possess pranic control or control over universal energy.    There exists in your physical organism reserve stores of vital energy  stored away for your use, particularly in that central ganglion of your  vital battery known as the Solar Plexus and generally in the chain of  ganglia or storage batteries along and up your spine and elsewhere in  other nerve-centres. The solar plexus is also known as the Abdominal  Brain and your brain depends and draws upon this vital centre for its  energies. You will find after the prolonged concentration and brain-work  that this part of your body--at the back of pit of stomach--becomes  warm. Now when you engage in physical exercise, for instance, you must  have noticed how at first you soon get tired and all done up. But if you  wait a little and then start again, you will find how the sense of  fatigue has quite passed away and you can run your body under full  pressure for a very long time, and the more you exert yourself the  greater and more powerful the surging up of your vital energy. With each  new exertion you seem to acquire a fresh start. This has puzzled  physiologists. You will find a parallel phenomenon in mental work. You  may experience a sense of weariness and fatigue in some brain-work which  demands close thinking and attention, but if you attack your work a  little later after the first effort you will do your work a surprising  degree of freshness, vigour, and enthusiasm far surpassing the original  attempt. Again everyone can and does put forth universal energy under  pressure of some urgent necessity, which will startle even himself. No  matter who you are and what your physical condition, there is an enormous  amount of power in your body that has never been drawn upon at all  and impatiently waiting for up-call. We go on in ordinary dog trot pace,  resting, limping, \"taking care of our health,\" and then we think we are  doing our best. Do not permit your mind to be self-hypnotised into a  false sense of being \"exhausted\" and \"ol"]]]
