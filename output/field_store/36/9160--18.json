This volume also contains his own  cadenza to the Beethoven violin concerto. In conclusion Mr. Kneisel laid  stress on the importance of the student's hearing the best music at  concert and recital as often as possible, and on the value and incentive  supplied by a musical atmosphere in the home and, on leaving him, I  could not help but feel that what he had said in our interview, his  reflections and observations based on an artistry beyond cavil, and an  authoritative experience, would be well worth pondering by every serious  student of the instrument. For Franz Kneisel speaks of what he knows.                                             XI                                    ADOLFO BETTI                        THE TECHNIC OF THE MODERN QUARTET      What lover of chamber music in its more perfect dispensations is not  familiar with the figure of Adolfo Betti, the guiding brain and bow of  the Flonzaley Quartet? Born in Florence, he played his first public  concert at the age of six, yet as a youth found it hard to choose  between literature, for which he had decided aptitude,[A] and music.  Fortunately for American concert audiences of to-day, he finally  inclined to the latter. An exponent of what many consider the greatest  of all violinistic schools, the Belgian, he studied for four years with  Cesar Thomson at Liege, spent four more concertizing in Vienna and  elsewhere, and returned to Thomson as the latter's assistant in the  Brussels Conservatory, three years before he joined the Flonzaleys, in  1903. With pleasant recollections of earlier meetings with this gifted  artist, the writer sought him out, and found him amiably willing to talk  about the modern quartet and its ideals, ideals which he personally has  done so much to realize.    [Footnote A: M. Betti has published a number of critical articles in the  _Guide Musical_ of Brussels, the _Rivista Musicale_ of Turin, etc.]                                THE MODERN QUARTET    \"You ask me how the modern quartet differs from its predecessors?\" said  Mr. Betti. \"It differs in many ways. For one thing the modern quartet  has developed in a way that makes its inner voices--second violin and  viola--much more important than they used to be. Originally, as in  Haydn's early quartets, we have a violin solo with three accompanying  instruments. In Beethoven's last quartets the intermediate voices have  already gained a freedom and individuality which before him had not even  been suspected. In these last quartets Beethoven has already set forth  the principle which was to become the basis of modern polyphony: '_first  of all_ to allow each voice to express itself freely and fully, and  _afterward_ to see what the relations were of one to the other.' In  fact, no one has exercised a more revolutionary effect on the quartet  than Beethoven--no one has made it attain so great a degree of  progress. And surely the distance separating the quartet as Beethoven  found it, from the quartet as he left it (Grand Fugue, Op. 131, Op.  132), is greater than that which lies between the Fugue Op. 132, and the  most advanced modern quartet, let us say, for instance, Schoenberg's Op.  7. Schoenberg, by the way, has only applied and developed the principles  established by Beethoven in the latter's last quartets. But in the  modern quartet we have a new element, one which tends more and more to  become preponderant, and which might be called _orchestral_ rather than  _da camera_. Smetana, Grieg, Tschaikovsky were the first to follow this  path, in which the majority of the moderns, including Franck and  Debussy, have followed them. And in addition, many among the most  advanced modern composers _strive for orchestral effects that often lie  outside the natural capabilities of the strings_!             [Illustration: ADOLFO BETTI, with hand-written note]    \"For instance Stravinsky, in the first of his three impressionistic  sketches for quartet (which we have played), has the first violin play  _ponticello_ throughout, not the natural _ponticello_, but a quite  special one, to produce an effect of a bag-pipe sounding at a distance.  I had to try again and again till I found the right technical means to  produce the effect desired. Then, the 'cello is used to imitate the  drum; there are special technical problems for the second violin--a  single sustained D, with an accompanying _pizzicato_ on the open  strings--while the viola is required to suggest the tramp of marching  feet. And, again, in other modern quartets we find special technical  devices undreamt of in earlier days. Borodine, for instance, is the  first to systematically employ successions of harmonics. In the trio of  his first quartet the melody is successively introduced by the 'cello  and the first violin, altogether in harmonics.                       THE MODERN QUARTET AND AMATEUR PLAYERS    \"You ask me whether the average quartet of amateurs, of lovers of string  music, can get much out of the more modern quartets. I would say yes,  but with some serious reservations. There has been much beautiful music  written, but most of it is complicated. In the case of the older  quartets, Haydn, Mozart, etc., even if they are not played well, the  performers can still obtain an idea of the music, of its thought  content. But in the modern quartets, unless each individual player has  mastered every technical difficulty, the musical idea does not pierce  through, there is no effect.    \"I remember when we rehearsed the first Schoenberg quartet. It was in  1913, at a Chicago hotel, and we had no score, but only the separate  parts. The results, at our first attempt, were so dreadful that we  stopped after a few pages. It was not till I had secured a score,  studied it and again tried it that we began to see a light. Finally  there was not one measure which we did not understand. But Schoenberg,  Reger, Ravel quartets make too great a demand on the technical ability  of the average quartet amateur.                           THE TECHNIC OF QUARTET PLAYING    \"Naturally, the first violin is the leader, the Conductor of the  quartet, as in its early days, although the 'star' system, with one  virtuose player and three satellites, has disappeared. Now the quartet  as a whole has established itself in the _virtuoso_ field--using the  word _virtuoso_ in its best sense. The Mueller quartet (Hanover),  1845-1850, was the first to travel as a chamber music organization, and  the famous _Florentiner_ Quartet the first to realize what could be  done in the way of finish in playing. As _premier violiniste_ of the  Flonzaley's I study and prepare the interpretation of the works we are  to play before any rehearsing is done.    \"While the first violin still holds first place in the modern quartet,  the second violin has become much more important than formerly; it has  gained in individuality. In many of the newer quartets it is quite as  important as the first. In Hugo Wolf's quartet, for example, first and  second violins are employed as though in a concerto for two violins.    \"The viola, especially in modern French works--Ravel, Debussy,  Samazeuil--has a prominent part. In the older quartets one reason the  viola parts are simple is because the alto players as a rule were  technically less skillful. As a general thing they were violinists who  had failed--'the refugees of the G clef,' as Edouard Colonne, the  eminent conductor, once wittily said. But the reason modern French  composers give the viola special attention is because France now is  ahead of the other nations in virtuose viola playing. It is practically  the only country which may be said to have a 'school' of viola playing.  In the Smetana quartet the viola plays a most important part, and  Dvorak, who himself played viola, emphasized the instrument in his  quartets.    \"Mozart showed what the 'cello was able to do in the quartets he  dedicated to the ''cellist king,' Frederick William of Prussia. And  then, the 'cello has always the musical importance which attaches to it  as the lower of the two 'outer voices' of the quartet _ensemble_. Like  the second violin and viola, it has experienced a technical and musical  development beyond anything Haydn or Mozart would have dared to write.                                     REHEARSING    \"Realization of the Art aims of the modern quartet calls for endless  rehearsal. Few people realize the hard work and concentrated effort  entailed. And there are always new problems to solve. After preparing a  new score in advance, we meet and establish its general idea, its broad  outlines in actual playing. And then, gradually, we fill in the details.  Ordinarily we rehearse three hours a day, less during the concert  season, of course; but always enough to keep absolutely in trim. And we  vary our practice programs in order to keep mentally fresh as well as  technically fit.                                     INTONATION    \"Perfect intonation is a great problem--one practically unknown to the  average amateur quartet player. Four players may each one of them be  playing in tune, in pitch; yet their chords may not be truly in tune,  because of the individual bias--a trifle sharp, a trifle flat--in  interpreting pitch. This individual bias may be caused by the attraction  existing between certain notes, by differences of register and _timbre_,  or any number of other reasons--too many to recount. The true beauty of  the quartet tone cannot be obtained unless there is an exact adjustment,  a tempering of the individual pitch of each instrument, till perfect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],[0,"Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#16)"],[1,"boudoir, where they were to assemble. The  ship stopped at the mandate of the captain, and the barge was lowered, and  brought to the gangway. The boat was as handsome as anything that ever  floated, and the stern-sheets were luxurious enough for a fairy craft. The  crew of nine were all dressed in their white uniforms, and sat with their  oars tossed, except the cockswain, who stood bolt upright abaft the  back-board.    There were sixteen in the party, and the \"Big Four\" made their way to the  fore-sheets; the ladies were handed into the stern by the three guests, and  the barge shoved off. The Blanche had taken a position on the beam of the  Guardian-Mother, her band playing for all they were worth. Captain Sharp  was on the platform of the gangway, and took every lady by the hand as he  assisted her to disembark. At the head of the gangway on deck stood General  Noury, who received the ladies, all of whom he had met before; and the  distinguished guests were presented to him, after which he shook hands with  every other member of the party. He was especially respectful, and even  reverential, to the commander of the Guardian-Mother, who had forgiven so  much in his past conduct.    Mrs. Sharp came in for a large share of the consideration of the visitors.  An hour was spent in the drawing-room, as they called the deck cabin, which  was as large as the boudoir and music-room of the Guardian-Mother. The band  had laid aside their brass instruments, and organized as an orchestra,  stationed in a sort of recess in the forward part of the cabin. The general  conversed with every person in the party; and when Scott addressed him as  \"Your Highness,\" he protested that he did not wish to hear the expression  again.    He talked French with Louis, Italian with Sir Modava, and Spanish with Lord  Tremlyn; for it was understood that he spoke at least half a dozen  languages besides his own, and the guests found he was equally fluent in  all they knew. To Miss Blanche he was very polite; but he did not give a  moment more to her than to the other ladies, much to the satisfaction of  her parents.    The dinner was fully equal to Mr. Sage's best efforts, and the occasion was  as hilarious and as pleasant as it could be. Possibly the English guests  missed their wine on such an occasion. Lord Tremlyn declared that he seldom  drank it at all, and Dr. Ferrolan said the same; and Sir Modava was the  strictest sort of a teetotaler, having been engaged in preaching this  doctrine among the Sepoys as opportunity offered. The captain of the  Blanche informed the commander of the Guardian-Mother that the general had  never touched wine since he came on board.    After dinner several of the gentlemen sang songs, and the general gave one  in Moroccan, which amused the party, though they could not understand a  word of it. Later in the evening Captain Ringgold made a speech  complimentary to General Noury, and wished him many happy returns of the  occasion they celebrated. He was followed by Dr. Hawkes, Uncle Moses,  Professor Giroud, and then by the three distinguished guests from the  Travancore.    The general replied to all of them at the close of the entertainment. He  was a pleasant speaker, and his handsome face added a great deal to his  words. The affair was declared to be a great success for a dinner-party at  sea, and the commander of the Guardian-Mother invited all their hosts to  assist him in a similar one on board his ship, the signal for which was to  be the American Union Jack when the weather was suitable.    The party returned to their ocean home; and the commander spent the rest of  the evening in telling his guests the story of General Noury, and  especially of his wonderful reformation.    \"Then Captain Sharp really saved his life?\" added Lord Tremlyn.    \"No doubt of it. The two ruffians in a street of Messina had disabled the  general, and would certainly have finished him if the captain had not  wounded one with his revolver, and tackled the other. He owes his life to  Sharp without a doubt. Mrs. Sharp took care of him for quite a time while  he was recovering from his wound, and she made a deep impression upon him.  He is a Mohammedan, and he sticks to his religion; but even that is capable  of making a better man of him than he was before.\"    \"I was much pleased with Mrs. Sharp, not because she is an English woman,  but because she is a very worthy person,\" added his lordship.    \"You are quite right, my lord, and she has had a romantic history;\" and  before they retired he had told the whole of it.    At the usual time the next day the company were assembled in Conference  Hall; and when the commander announced that Lord Tremlyn would address them  on the general subject, \"The People of India,\" they manifested their  interest by a liberal salvo of applause.                                           CHAPTER XII                          THE POPULATION AND PEOPLE OF INDIA      \"Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to appear before you, and to look you all  in the face,\" his lordship began as the applause subsided. \"The task befaw  me is to put a gallon of fluid into a pint pot. It cawn't be done. I shall  not attempt to do what is quite impossible. I can only put in what the  vessel will hold. I cawn't say all there is to be said about the people of  India in an hour, or even two or three hours.\"    The noble gentleman was an easy, pleasant, and fluent speaker, evidently  quite accustomed to addressing public assemblies; but he had certain  peculiarities of speech, a very few of them, which sounded just a little  odd to the Americans, as doubtless some of their pronunciation did to the  Britons. But there is hardly a perceptible difference in the pronunciation  of highly trained speakers of one nation and the other. It is not necessary  to indicate any farther the slightly peculiar speech of the accomplished  gentleman.    \"I can only select from the mass of material before me what I think will be  most interesting and useful to you; for I have been warned that I must not  talk all day,\" continued the viscount.    \"We leave that to your lordship's own judgment,\" added Captain Ringgold.    \"I will be merciful, Mr. Commander: as merciful as possible. Next to China,  India is the most populous country on the globe; and without Nepaul, it  numbered, in 1891, 287,223,917, or more than one-seventh of the people on  the face of the earth; and the increase in the last decade was almost  28,000,000,--enough to populate about a dozen of your larger States.    \"In spite of its vast population, India cannot be said to be a very densely  peopled region; 184 to the square mile for the whole country. The mountain  territory is quite thinly settled. All the native states have but 108 to  the square mile, though the plains of the Ganges show about 400. About  Benares and Patna the average is about double these figures. I was looking  at the 'Year-Book' in your library, and I saw that the average in the  States, including Alaska, is about 18 to the square mile; but the nine  States in the north-east have 107.    \"The little bit of a State of Rhode Island leads in the density of its  population, with 318, while Massachusetts comes next with 278. New Jersey  has 193, Connecticut, 154; the big States of New York and Pennsylvania have  respectively 126 and 117. In the United Kingdom the average in England is  541; in Scotland, 135; in Wales, 206; and in Ireland, 144. The density of  India, therefore, is quite respectable by comparison.    \"By the census of 1891, India has seventy-five towns with over 50,000  inhabitants, and twenty-eight with over 100,000; but unlike three cities of  the States, it has not one with over a million, though Calcutta and Bombay  are likely to reach that distinction in another decade. You have not a  monopoly of the fast-growing cities in the States.\"    \"We have found out that Berlin has increased faster than Chicago,\" said  Uncle Moses with a chuckle; \"and Glasgow has got ahead of Liverpool.\"    \"Quite true, Mr. Scarburn; but the States have not all the fast-growing  cities of the world, wonderful as the increase has been in some of them.  Europe, Asia, and Australia are alive. The nearest approaches to a million  in India are Calcutta, 861,764, and Bombay, 821,764; but I dare say you are  all quite tired of statistics by this time.\"    \"Not at all, Lord Tremlyn; as you present them they are quite interesting.\"  said Mrs. Belgrave.    \"Thank you, madam,\" replied the speaker, bowing low, with his hand on his  heart. \"Now I am going to speak of the people as other than mere numbers;  and if I wished to entangle you inextricably, I should go back about 4,000  years, and tell you about the people down to the present time. I spare you  the infliction in full. Four groups of languages are spoken among the  natives, and from these the original races that spoke them are traced out.    \"I mention one as a specimen, the Kolarian language, spoken by those who  first settled in the hilly regions of the central part. The others are the  Aryan, Dravidian, and Tibeto-Burman, all of which you will find in  'Chambers's' in your library.    \"The word Hindu is generally used in a very broad sense to cover all the  native population of Hindustan or India; but it is really applicable to a  religion, and belongs only to those of the Hindu, or the faith of the  Brahmins; but, like most others, it consists of a great number of sects. Of  this belief there are about 200,000,000 people. They are divided into four  grand classes, called castes. The Portuguese called them _casta_ in  their own language, from which the present name comes. I call them grand  classes, or castes, because they are divided into many sub-classes.    \"When the Aryans, who came from Europe, and Asia farther north than India,  obtained a foothold here, and established themselves, they looked down upon  other people in the land, and called themselves"]]]
