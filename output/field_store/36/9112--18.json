The creed of Zoroaster, which naturally occurs to unassisted reason as a  mode of accounting for the mingled existence of good and evil in the  visible world--that belief which, in one modification or another,  supposes the co-existence of a benevolent and malevolent principle,  which contend together without either being able decisively to prevail  over his antagonist, leads the fear and awe deeply impressed on the  human mind to the worship as well of the author of evil, so tremendous  in all the effects of which credulity accounts him the primary cause, as  to that of his great opponent, who is loved and adored as the father of  all that is good and bountiful. Nay, such is the timid servility of  human nature that the worshippers will neglect the altars of the Author  of good rather than that of Arimanes, trusting with indifference to the  well-known mercy of the one, while they shrink from the idea of  irritating the vengeful jealousy of the awful father of evil.    The Celtic tribes, by whom, under various denominations, Europe seems to  have been originally peopled, possessed, in common with other savages, a  natural tendency to the worship of the evil principle. They did not,  perhaps, adore Arimanes under one sole name, or consider the malignant  divinities as sufficiently powerful to undertake a direct struggle with  the more benevolent gods; yet they thought it worth while to propitiate  them by various expiatory rites and prayers, that they, and the  elementary tempests which they conceived to be under their direct  command, might be merciful to suppliants who had acknowledged their  power, and deprecated their vengeance.    Remains of these superstitions might be traced till past the middle of  the last century, though fast becoming obsolete, or passing into mere  popular customs of the country, which the peasantry observe without  thinking of their origin. About 1769, when Mr. Pennant made his tour,  the ceremony of the Baaltein, Beltane, or First of May, though varying  in different districts of the Highlands, was yet in strict observance,  and the cake, which was then baken with scrupulous attention to certain  rites and forms, was divided into fragments, which were formally  dedicated to birds or beasts of prey that they, or rather the being  whose agents they were, might spare the flocks and herds.[9]    [Footnote 9: See Tennant's \"Scottish Tour,\" vol. i. p. III. The  traveller mentions that some festival of the same kind was in his time  observed in Gloucestershire.]    Another custom of similar origin lingered late among us. In many  parishes of Scotland there was suffered to exist a certain portion of  land, called _the gudeman's croft_, which was never ploughed or  cultivated, but suffered to remain waste, like the TEMENOS of a pagan  temple, Though it was not expressly avowed, no one doubted that \"the  goodman's croft\" was set apart for some evil being; in fact, that it was  the portion of the arch-fiend himself, whom our ancestors distinguished  by a name which, while it was generally understood, could not, it was  supposed, be offensive to the stern inhabitant of the regions of  despair. This was so general a custom that the Church published an  ordinance against it as an impious and blasphemous usage.    This singular custom sunk before the efforts of the clergy in the  seventeenth century; but there must still be many alive who, in  childhood, have been taught to look with wonder on knolls and patches of  ground left uncultivated, because, whenever a ploughshare entered the  soil, the elementary spirits were supposed to testify their displeasure  by storm and thunder. Within our own memory, many such places,  sanctified to barrenness by some favourite popular superstition,  existed, both in Wales and Ireland, as well as in Scotland; but the high  price of agricultural produce during the late war renders it doubtful if  a veneration for greybearded superstition has suffered any one of them  to remain undesecrated. For the same reason the mounts called Sith  Bhruaith were respected, and it was deemed unlawful and dangerous to cut  wood, dig earth and stones, or otherwise disturb them.[10]    [Footnote 10: See \"Essay on the Subterranean Commonwealth,\" by Mr.  Robert Kirke, minister of Aberfoyle.]    Now, it may at first sight seem strange that the Christian religion  should have permitted the existence of such gross and impious relics of  heathenism, in a land where its doctrines had obtained universal  credence. But this will not appear so wonderful when it is recollected  that the original Christians under the heathen emperors were called to  conversion by the voice of apostles and saints, invested for the purpose  with miraculous powers, as well of language, for communicating their  doctrine to the Gentiles, as of cures, for the purpose of authenticating  their mission. These converts must have been in general such elect  persons as were effectually called to make part of the infant church;  and when hypocrites ventured, like Ananias and Sapphira, to intrude  themselves into so select an association, they were liable, at the  Divine pleasure, to be detected and punished. On the contrary, the  nations who were converted after Christianity had become the religion of  the empire were not brought within the pale upon such a principle of  selection, as when the church consisted of a few individuals, who had,  upon conviction, exchanged the errors of the pagan religion for the  dangers and duties incurred by those who embraced a faith inferring the  self-denial of its votaries, and at the same time exposing them to  persecution. When the cross became triumphant, and its cause no longer  required the direction of inspired men, or the evidence of miracles, to  compel reluctant belief, it is evident that the converts who thronged  into the fold must have, many of them, entered because Christianity was  the prevailing faith--many because it was the church, the members of  which rose most readily to promotion--many, finally, who, though content  to resign the worship of pagan divinities, could not at once clear their  minds of heathen ritual and heathen observances, which they  inconsistently laboured to unite with the more simple and majestic faith  that disdained such impure union. If this was the case, even in the  Roman empire, where the converts to the Christian faith must have found,  among the earlier members of the church, the readiest and the soundest  instruction, how much more imperfectly could those foreign and barbarous  tribes receive the necessary religious information from some zealous and  enthusiastic preacher, who christened them by hundreds in one day? Still  less could we imagine them to have acquired a knowledge of Christianity,  in the genuine and perfect sense of the word, when, as was frequently  the case, they only assumed the profession of the religion that had  become the choice of some favoured chief, whose example they followed in  mere love and loyalty, without, perhaps, attaching more consequence to a  change of religion than to a change of garments. Such hasty converts,  professing themselves Christians, but neither weaned from their old  belief, nor instructed in their new one, entered the sanctuary without  laying aside the superstitions with which their young minds had been  imbued; and accustomed to a plurality of deities, some of them, who  bestowed unusual thought on the matter, might be of opinion that, in  adopting the God of the Christians, they had not renounced the service  of every inferior power.    If, indeed, the laws of the empire could have been supposed to have had  any influence over those fierce barbarians, who conceived that the  empire itself lay before them as a spoil, they might have been told that  Constantine, taking the offence of alleged magicians and sorcerers in  the same light in which it was viewed in the law of Moses, had denounced  death against any who used these unlawful enquiries into futurity. \"Let  the unlawful curiosity of prying into futurity,\" says the law, \"be  silent in every one henceforth and for ever.[11] For, subjected to the  avenging sword of the law, he shall be punished capitally who disobeys  our commands in this matter.\"    [Footnote 11: \"Codex,\" lib. ix. tit. 18, cap. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.]    If, however, we look more closely into this enactment, we shall be led  to conclude that the civil law does not found upon the prohibitions and  penalties in Scripture; although it condemns the _ars mathematica_ (for  the most mystic and uncertain of all sciences, real or pretended, at  that time held the title which now distinguishes the most exact) as a  damnable art, and utterly interdicted, and declares that the  practitioners therein should die by fire, as enemies of the human  race--yet the reason of this severe treatment seems to be different from  that acted upon in the Mosaical institutions. The weight of the crime  among the Jews was placed on the blasphemy of the diviners, and their  treason against the theocracy instituted by Jehovah. The Roman  legislators were, on the other hand, moved chiefly by the danger arising  to the person of the prince and the quiet of the state, so apt to be  unsettled by every pretence or encouragement to innovation. The reigning  emperors, therefore, were desirous to place a check upon the mathematics  (as they termed the art of divination), much more for a political than a  religious cause, since we observe, in the history of the empire, how  often the dethronement or death of the sovereign was produced by  conspiracies or mutinies which took their rise from pretended  prophecies. In this mode of viewing the crime, the lawyers of the lower  empire acted upon the example of those who had compiled the laws of the  twelve tables.[12] The mistaken and misplaced devotion which Horace  recommends to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#16)"],[1,"prosperity. Then came the almost certain chance of  their beasts being raided, of their stores being looted, and of their  women and children having to seek shelter to avoid rough treatment and  incivility. Often during the long evenings, especially when I was  suffering from depression of spirits, I used to argue with Mr. Keeley  about the war and whether it was necessary. It seemed to me then we were  not justified in letting loose such a millstream of wretchedness and of  destruction, and that the alleged wrongs of a large white  population--who, in spite of everything, seemed to prosper and grow rich  apace--scarcely justified the sufferings of thousands of innocent  individuals. Mr. Keeley was a typical old colonist, one who knew the  Boers and their character well, and I merely quote what he said, as no  doubt it was, and is, the opinion of many other such men. He opined that  this struggle was bound to come, declaring that all the thinking men of  the country had foreseen it. The intolerance of the Boers, their  arrogance, their ignorance, on which they prided themselves, all  proclaimed them as unfit to rule over white or black people. Of late  years had crept in an element of treachery and disloyalty, emanating  from their jealousy of the English, which by degrees was bound to  permeate the whole country, spreading southward to Cape Colony itself,  till the idea of \"Africa for the Dutch, and the English in the sea,\"  would have been a war-cry that might have dazzled hundreds of to-day's  so-called loyal colonists. He even asserted that those at the head of  affairs in England had shown great perspicacity and a clear insight into  the future. If at the Bloemfontein Conference, or after, Kruger had  given the five years' franchise, and the dispute had been patched up for  the moment, it would have been the greatest misfortune that could have  happened. The intriguing in the colony, the reckless expenditure of the  Transvaal Secret Service money, the bribery and corruption of the most  corrupt Government of modern times, would have gone on as before, and  things would soon have been as bad as ever. Mr. Keeley was positive that  it was jealousy that had engendered this race hatred one heard so much  about; even the well-to-do Dutch knew the English were superior to them  in knowledge and enterprise. At the same time any English invention was  looked upon with awe and interest; they were wont to copy us in many  respects, and if a Dutch girl had the chance of marrying an Englishman,  old or young, poor or rich, she did not wait to be asked a second time.  There is no doubt the women were a powerful factor in Boerland. Even a  Britisher married to a Dutchwoman seemed at once to consider her people  as his people, and the Transvaal as his fatherland. These women were  certainly the most bitter against the English; they urged their husbands  in the district to go and join the commandoes, and their language was  cruel and bloodthirsty.           *       *       *       *       *    Towards the middle of November I decided that I could not remain in my  present quarters much longer. My presence was attracting unwelcome  attention to my kind host and hostess, albeit they would not admit it.  From the report that I was a man dressed as a woman, the rumour had now  changed to the effect that I was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria,  sent specially out by Her Majesty to inform her of the proceedings of  her rebellious subjects. Another person had heard I was the wife of the  General who was giving the Boers so much trouble at Mafeking. I  determined, therefore, to return to Mrs. Fraser's hotel, which was  always a stage nearer Mafeking, whither I was anxious to return  eventually. As a matter of fact, there was no alternative resting-place.  It was impossible to pass south to Kimberley, to the west lay the  Kalahari Desert, and to the east the Transvaal. With many grateful  thanks to the Keeleys, I rode off one morning, with Vellum in  attendance, to Setlagoli, which I had left a month before. We thought it  prudent to make sure there were no Boers about before bringing the  Government mules and cart. Therefore I arranged for my maid to follow in  this vehicle if she heard nothing to the contrary within twenty-four  hours. Mrs. Fraser was delighted to see me, and reported the Boers all  departed after a temporary occupation, so there I settled down for  another period of weary waiting.

[29] Mr. Murchison was shut up in the gaol awaiting Lord Roberts's  confirmation of his sentence. When Eloff succeeded in entering Mafeking  many months later, the former was liberated with the other prisoners,  and given a rifle to fire on the Boers, which he did with much effect. I  believe he was afterwards taken to a gaol in the Isle of Wight, but I do  not know if his life-sentence is still in force.    [30] This gentleman on a later occasion again attempted to leave  Mafeking on horseback, and was taken prisoner by the Boers and sent to  Pretoria, leaving the _Daily Mail_ without a correspondent in Mafeking.  At the request of that paper I then undertook to send them cables about  the siege.          CHAPTER VIII         BETRAYED BY A PIGEON--THE BOERS COME AT LAST         \"For a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which       has wings shall tell the matter.\"--ECCLES. x. 20.      The day after my arrival at Setlagoli some natives came in with  apparently well-authenticated news of an English victory near Vryburg.  They also asserted that the line was already being relaid to Maribogo,  and that the railway servants had returned to that station. I drove over  at once to prove the truth of their statements; of course, I found they  were all false, except the fact of the station-master having returned to  the barricaded and desolate station. I discovered him sitting  disconsolately at the door of his ruined house, gloomily perusing  \"Nicholas Nickleby.\" On returning home, I was delighted to find  interesting letters from Mr. and Mrs. Rochfort Maguire, who were shut up  in Kimberley, as was also Mr. Rhodes. The latter had despatched them by  a boy, ordered to continue his journey to Mafeking with other missives  and also with some colonial newspapers. These latter, only about a  fortnight old, we fairly spelled through before sending them on. They  were already so mutilated by constant unfolding that in parts they were  scarcely decipherable, but none the less very precious. Two days later  arrived a representative of Reuter's Agency, whom I shall call Mr. P. He  had come by rail and horseback straight from Cape Town and he was also  under orders to proceed to Mafeking; but his horses were so done up that  he decided to give them a few days' rest. I took advantage of his escort  to carry out a long-cherished desire to see the wreck of the armoured  train at Kraipann. Accompanied by a boy to show us the way, we started  after an early lunch. As it was a Sunday, there was not much fear of our  meeting any Boers, as the latter were always engaged that day in  psalm-singing and devotions. We cantered gaily along, passing many  Kaffir huts, outside of which were grouped wondering natives, in their  Sunday best. These kept up a lively conversation with our guide as long  as we remained within earshot. I was always impressed with the  freemasonry that existed in that country among the blacks. Everywhere  they found acquaintances, and very often relations. They used to tell me  that such and such a man was their wife's cousin or their aunt's  brother. Moreover, as long as you were accompanied by a native, you  were always sure of certain information concerning the whereabouts of  the Boers; but to these latter they would lie with stupid, solemn faces.  When we neared Kraipann, we came to a region of rocks and kopjes, truly  a God-forsaken country. Leaving our horses in the native stadt, we  proceeded on foot to the scene of the disaster. There was not much to  see, after all--merely a pilot armoured engine, firmly embedded its  whole length in the gravel. Next to this, an ordinary locomotive, still  on the rails, riddled on one side with bullets, and on the other  displaying a gaping aperture into the boiler, which told its own tale.  Then came an armoured truck--H.M.'s _Mosquito_--that I had seen leaving  Mafeking so trim and smart, but now battered with shot; and lastly  another truck, which had been carrying the guns. This had been pushed  back into a culvert, and presented a dilapidated appearance, with its  front wheels in the air. The whole spectacle was forlorn and eerie. All  the time I gave cursory glances right and left, to make sure no Boers  were prowling about, and I should not have been surprised to have seen  an unkempt head bob up and ask us our business. But all remained as  silent as the grave. Swarms of locusts were alone in possession, and  under the engine and carriages the earth was a dark brown moving mass,  with the stream of these jumping, creeping things. I had soon gratified  my curiosity, and persuaded my companion, who was busy photographing,  also to leave this desolate spot.    The Boers continued to ride roughshod over the land, commandeering oxen  and cattle, putting up to public auction such Government properties as  they had seized at the different railway-stations, and employing  hundreds of Kaffirs to tear up the railway-line. Our enemies were  perfectly secure in the knowledge that no help could come for months,  and the greater number believed it would never come at all, and that the  \"Roineks\" were being cut to pieces in the South. They openly stated  there would be no more railway traffic, but that in future trade and  transit would be carried on by transport riding--_i.e._, by ox-waggon,  their favourite amusement and occupation.
