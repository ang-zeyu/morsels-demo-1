There is no possibility of  adjusting them readily to suit variations in the speed of the current or  in the quantity of water required, nor of moving them from place to place  should this be convenient.    [Illustration: PARACHUTE HYDRAULIC MOTOR.]    The motor of Mr. Jagn is on a totally different principle. Its essential  features consist, as shown, of an endless rope made of hemp or aloe fiber,  which takes a turn or two round a pair of drums mounted on a barge or  pontoon, and then passes down the channel to return over a pulley hung  from a floating punt, at such a depth that the whole of the rope is  immersed in the water. Along this rope are suspended at equal intervals a  number of parachutes made of sail cloth. The rope passes through the  center of each of these, and to it are attached a series of strings, the  other ends of which are connected to the outside edge of the parachute.  Thus they act like the spokes of an umbrella to prevent the parachute from  opening too far under the pressure of the current. The parachutes must be  placed so far apart that the current may act fairly on each, and the sum  of the pressures forms the force which draws the rope through the water.  The moment, however, that any parachute has passed round the return  pulley, the current acts upon it in the opposite direction. It then shuts  up like an umbrella, and assumes a volume so small that its resistance on  the return journey is insignificant. After passing round the drum at the  upper end, it at once opens afresh of its own accord, and once more  becomes part of the moving power of the whole system. The parachutes are  formed by first cutting out a complete circle of cloth, and then taking  from this a sector equal to one-fifth or one-sixth of the total area. Such  parachutes are found to keep their form when stretched by the water better  than a surface originally spherical, although the latter would be  theoretically more correct. The motion of the drum is transmitted by spur,  gear, or otherwise as may be required, to give the requisite speed.    It will be seen that the advantages of the system are as follows: First,  the facility it offers for obtaining a large working area, which may be  increased or diminished at will, according to the requirements of the  moment, by lengthening or shortening the rope. Secondly, the ease with  which it is erected and set to work. Thirdly, the small part of the river  section which it occupies, so as to present no obstacle to navigation.  Fourthly, the ease with which it can be mounted on a barge of any kind,  and carried wherever it may be needed. Fifthly, it is not stopped, like  all other hydraulic motors, by the appearance of ice--it has, in fact,  already been worked under ice in the Neva. At the same time, winds and  waves have no influence upon it.    The principle of the apparatus is not altogether new. In 1872 there was  tried on the Ohio River an arrangement termed the Brooks motor. It was  composed of two drums, placed horizontally and parallel to each other.  Round these there passed endless chains at equal spaces apart on the  length of the drums, and to these chains were fixed wooden blades or arms  of a curved form, and so jointed to the frames that they opened when  moving in one direction, and closed down on the chain when moving in the  other. In this machine the weight of the chains was a serious obstacle to  obtaining any large amount of power. The whole apparatus was mounted on a  heavy wooden scaffold, which proved an impediment to the flow of the  river. Again, the resistance due to the surface of the returning blades  and to their stiffness was found to be far from insignificant.    In the present system Mr. Jagn has found, after many experiments, that the  best effect was obtained when the parachutes were spaced apart at twice  their diameter, and when the rope made an angle of 8 degrees to 10 degrees  with the current. It is found that when open and in motion the parachutes  never touch the bottom. This was the case with a rope containing 180  parachutes of 4 feet diameter, and working in a depth of only 6 feet. This  is easily explained by the fact that the velocity of a current always  diminishes as it approaches the bottom. Hence the pressure on the lower  part of the parachute will be less than that on the upper part; but the  former pressure tends to draw the parachute downward, while the latter  tends to raise it to the top of the water. Thus, the latter being the  larger, the parachute will always have a tendency to rise. In fact, it is  necessary to sink the return pulley sufficiently deep to make sure that  the parachutes will not emerge from the surface. For the same reason no  intermediate supports are needed over the driving span; if any are needed  it is for the return span, on which the parachutes are closed. Of course,  if metal were used instead of hemp, the case would be entirely different,  and intermediate supports would have to be used for anything but very  moderate lengths.    In practice, Mr. Jagn has employed two ropes wound upon the same pair of  drums, which are mounted upon a pontoon. The ropes are spread out from  each other, as in Fig. 1, making an angle of about 10 degrees. The low  specific gravity of the system enables ropes to be employed of as great a  length as 450 yards, each of them carrying 350 parachutes of 17.2 square  feet area. As half of these are in action at the same time, the total  working area for the two cables is 5,860 square feet. This immense area  furnishes a considerable amount of power even in a river of feeble  current. Comparing this with a floating water wheel of the type sometimes  employed, and supposing this to have only 172 square feet of working area,  such a wheel must have a length of 46 feet, a diameter of 23 feet, and  seventy-two floats, each 21/2 feet wide. The enormous dimensions thus  required for a comparatively small working area point sufficiently clearly  to the advantage which remains on the side of the parachute motor.    The general arrangement of the system is shown in the engraving. Behind  the return pulleys, D D, are attached cords, A A, with some parachutes  strung upon them. These present their openings to the current and preserve  the tension of the connecting ropes. At the further end of each cord is a  board, B, which is kept in a vertical plane, but lying at a slight angle  to the direction of the current; and this acts to keep the two moving  ropes apart from each other. The two return pulleys are, however,  connected by a line, E, which can be shortened or lengthened from the  pontoon, and in this way the angle of inclination between the two ropes  can be varied if required. A grooved pulley presses upon the trailing span  at the moment before it reaches the circumference of the drum. It is  mounted on a screwed spindle, which is depressed by a nut, and thus makes  the wet rope grip the outside of the drum in a thoroughly efficacious  manner.    The author has made a theoretical investigation of the power which may be  developed by the system, and has worked out tables by which, when the  velocity of the current and the other elements of the problem are known,  the power developed by any given number of parachutes can be at once  determined. We do not reproduce this investigation, which takes account of  the resistance of the returning parachutes and other circumstances, but  will content ourselves with quoting the final equation, which is as  follows: T = 0.328 S V cubed. Here T is the work done in H.P., S is the total  working area in sq. m., and V is the velocity of the current in m. per  sec. Taking V = 1, and S = 1 sq. m., which is by no means an impracticable  quantity, we have T = 0.328 H.P. per sq. m. We may check this result by  the equation given, in English measures, by Rankine--\"Applied Mechanics,\"  p. 398--for the pressure of a current upon a solid body immersed in it.  This equation, F = 1.8 m A v squared / 2g, where m is the weight of a unit of  volume of the fluid--say 62 lb.--A is the area exposed, and v the relative  velocity of the current. Mr. Jagn finds that the maximum of efficiency is  obtained when the rope moves at one-third the velocity of the stream. If  this velocity be 3 feet per second, we shall have v = 2. and we then get F  = 7 lb. per sq. ft. very nearly. Now 1 sq. meter = 10.76 sq. ft., and a  speed of 1 ft. per second (which is that of the rope) is 60 ft. per  minute. Hence the H.P. realized in the same case as that taken above will  be 7 x 10.76 x 60 / 33,000 = 0.137 H.P. The difference between the two  values is very large, but Rankine, of course, depends entirely on the  value of the constant 1.8, which is quite empirical, and is for a flat  band instead of a hollow parachute. Taking, however, his smaller figure,  and an area of 544 square inches, which Mr. Jagn has actually employed, we  get a gross power of = 0.137 x 544 = 7.43 H.P. Hence it will be seen that  the amount of power which can be realized by the system is far from being  inconsiderable.    Lastly, we may point out that the durability of the apparatus will be  considerable. There is no wear except at the moment when the rope is  passing round the drum, and even then there need be no slipping or  grinding. The apparatus worked in the Neva was in very good condition  after running for four months day and night. After five months about  one-fifth of the parachutes had to be replaced, but after seven months the  hemp rope still showed no signs of wear. We think we have said enough to  show that for certain purposes, and especially, as we have, already  mentioned, for irrigation purposes, the new motor is well worthy of a  careful and extended trial. It may be questioned even whether we have not  here the germ of an idea which may hereafter enable us to solve one of the  most interesting and important of engineering problems, viz., the  utilization "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14"],[0,"The 1990 CIA World Factbook (#16)"],[1,"products, 16 km;

Bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural  resources, a rapid population growth of 2.8% a year and a limited  infrastructure, and it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters.  Despite these constraints, real GDP averaged about 3.8% annually  during 1985-88. One of the poorest nations in the world, alleviation  of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's development  strategy. The agricultural sector contributes over 50% to GDP and  75% to exports, and employs over 74% of the labor force. Industry  accounts for about 10% of GDP.    GDP: $20.6 billion, per capita $180; real growth rate 2.1% (FY89 est.)    Inflation rate (consumer prices): 8-10% (FY89 est.)    Unemployment rate: 30% (FY88 est.)    Budget: revenues $1.8 billion; expenditures $3.3 billion, including  capital expenditures of $1.7 billion (FY89)    Exports: $1.3 billion (f.o.b., FY89 est.);  commodities--jute, tea, leather, shrimp, manufacturing;  partners--US 25%, Western Europe 22%, Middle East 9%, Japan 8%,  Eastern Europe 7%    Imports: $3.1 billion (c.i.f., FY89 est.);  commodities--food, petroleum and other energy, nonfood consumer goods,  semiprocessed goods, and capital equipment;  partners--Western Europe 18%, Japan 14%, Middle East 9%, US 8%    External debt: $10.4 billion (December 1989)    Industrial production: growth rate 5.4% (FY89 est.)
