He showed us    excellent pictures; two especially, those of the four Evangelists    and Henry VIII. In our going my landlord carried us through a very    old hospital or almshouse, where forty poor people were    maintained; a very old foundation, and over the chimney-piece was    an inscription in brass: 'Orato pro anima Thomae Bird,' &c. They    brought me a draft of their drink in a brown bowl, tipt with    silver, which I drank off, and at the bottom was a picture of the    Virgin with the child in her arms done in silver. So we took    leave....\"    The inscription and the \"brown bowl\" (which is a mazer cup) still  remain, but the picturesque front of the hospital, built in the reign  of Edward VI, disappeared during the awful \"improvements\" which took  place during the \"fifties.\" A drawing of it survives in the local  museum.    Maldon, the capital of the Blackwater district, is to the eye of an  artist a town for twilight effects. The picturesque skyline of its  long, straggling street is accentuated in the early morning or  afterglow, when much undesirable detail of modern times below the  tiled roofs is blurred and lost. In broad daylight the quaintness of  its suburbs towards the river reeks of the salt flavour of W.W.  Jacobs's stories. Formerly the town was rich with such massive timber  buildings as still appear in the yard of the Blue Boar--an ancient  hostelry which was evidently modernized externally in Pickwickian  times. While exploring in the outhouses of this hostel Mr. Roe lighted  on a venerable posting-coach of early nineteenth-century origin among  some other decaying vehicles, a curiosity even more rare nowadays than  the Gothic king-posts to be seen in the picturesque half-timbered  billiard-room.    [Illustration: Maldon, Essex. Sky-line of the High Street at twilight]    The country around Maldon is dotted plentifully with evidences of  past ages; Layer Marney, with its famous towers; D'Arcy Hall, noted  for containing some of the finest linen panelling in England; Beeleigh  Abbey, and other old-world buildings. The sea-serpent may still be  seen at Heybridge, on the Norman church-door, one of the best of its  kind, and exhibiting almost all its original ironwork, including the  chimerical decorative clamp.    [Illustration: St. Mary's Church, Maldon]    The ancient house exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition at  Shepherd's Bush was a typical example of an Elizabethan dwelling. It  was brought from Ipswich, where it was doomed to make room for the  extension of Co-operative Stores, but so firmly was it built that, in  spite of its age of three hundred and fifty years, it defied for some  time the attacks of the house-breakers. It was built in 1563, as the  date carved on the solid lintel shows, but some parts of the structure  may have been earlier. All the oak joists and rafters had been  securely mortised into each other and fixed with stout wooden pins. So  securely were these pins fixed, that after many vain attempts to knock  them out, they had all to be bored out with augers. The mortises and  tenons were found to be as sound and clean as on the day when they  were fitted by the sixteenth-century carpenters. The foundations and  the chimneys were built of brick. The house contained a large  entrance-hall, a kitchen, a splendidly carved staircase, a  living-room, and two good bedrooms, on the upper floor. The whole  house was a fine specimen of East Anglian half-timber work. The  timbers that formed the framework were all straight, the diamond and  curved patterns, familiar in western counties, signs of later  construction, being altogether absent. One of the striking features of  this, as of many other timber-framed houses, is the carved corner or  angle post. It curves outwards as a support to the projecting first  floor to the extent of nearly two feet, and the whole piece was hewn  out of one massive oak log, the root, as was usual, having been placed  upwards, and beautifully carved with Gothic floriations. The full  overhang of the gables is four feet six inches. In later examples this  distance between the gables and the wall was considerably reduced,  until at last the barge-boards were flush with the wall. The joists of  the first floor project from under a finely carved string-course, and  the end of each joist has a carved finial. All the inside walls were  panelled with oak, and the fire-place is of the typical old English  character, with seats for half a dozen people in the ingle-nook. The  principal room had a fine Tudor door, and the frieze and some of the  panels were enriched with an inlay of holly. When the house was  demolished many of the choicest fittings which were missing from their  places were found carefully stowed under the floor boards. Possibly a  raid or a riot had alarmed the owners in some distant period, and they  hid their nicest things and then were slain, and no one knew of the  secret hiding-place.    [Illustration: Norman Clamp on door of Heybridge Church, Essex]    [Illustration: Tudor Fire-place. Now walled up in the passage of a  shop in Banbury]    The Rector of Haughton calls attention to a curious old house which  certainly ought to be preserved if it has not yet quite vanished.      \"It is completely hidden from the public gaze. Right away in the    fields, to be reached only by footpath, or by strangely circuitous    lane, in the parish of Ranton, there stands a little old    half-timbered house, known as the Vicarage Farm. Only a very    practised eye would suspect the treasures that it contains.    Entering through the original door, with quaint knocker intact,    you are in the kitchen with a fine open fire-place, noble beam,    and walls panelled with oak. But the principal treasure consists    in what I have heard called 'The priest's room.' I should venture    to put the date of the house at about 1500--certainly    pre-Reformation. How did it come to be there? and what purpose did    it serve? I have only been able to find one note which can throw    any possible light on the matter. Gough says that a certain Rose    (Dunston?) brought land at Ranton to her husband John Doiley; and    he goes on: 'This man had the consent of William, the Prior of    Ranton, to erect a chapel at Ranton.' The little church at Ranton    has stood there from the thirteenth century, as the architecture    of the west end and south-west doorway plainly testify. The church    and cell (or whatever you may call it) must clearly have been an    off-shoot from the Priory. But the room: for this is what is    principally worth seeing. The beam is richly moulded, and so is    the panelling throughout. It has a very well carved course of    panelling all round the top, and this is surmounted by an    elaborate cornice. The stone mantelpiece is remarkably fine and of    unusual character. But the most striking feature of the room is a    square-headed arched recess, or niche, with pierced spandrels.    What was its use? It is about the right height for a seat, and    what may have been the seat is there unaltered. Or was it a niche    containing a Calvary, or some figure? I confess I know nothing. Is    this a unique example? I cannot remember any other. But possibly    there may be others, equally hidden away, comparison with which    might unfold its secret. In this room, and in other parts of the    house, much of the old ironwork of hinges and door-fasteners    remains, and is simply excellent. The old oak sliding shutters are    still there, and two more fine stone mantelpieces; on one hearth    the original encaustic tiles with patterns, chiefly a Maltese    cross, and the oak cill surrounding them, are _in situ_. I confess    I tremble for the safety of this priceless relic. The house is in    a somewhat dilapidated condition; and I know that one attempt was    made to buy the panelling and take it away. Surely such a monument    of the past should be in some way guarded by the nation.\"    The beauty of English cottage-building, its directness, simplicity,  variety, and above all its inevitable quality, the intimate way in  which the buildings ally themselves with the soil and blend with the  ever-varied and exquisite landscape, the delicate harmonies, almost  musical in their nature, that grow from their gentle relationship with  their surroundings, the modulation from man's handiwork to God's  enveloping world that lies in the quiet gardening that binds one to  the other without discord or dissonance--all these things are  wonderfully attractive to those who have eyes to see and hearts to  understand. The English cottages have an importance in the story of  the development of architecture far greater than that which concerns  their mere beauty and picturesqueness. As we follow the history of  Gothic art we find that for the most part the instinctive art in  relation to church architecture came to an end in the first quarter of  the sixteenth century, but the right impulse did not cease.  House-building went on, though there was no church-building, and we  admire greatly some of those grand mansions which were reared in the  time of Elizabeth and the early Stuarts; but art was declining, a  crumbling taste causing disintegration of the sense of real beauty and  refinement of detail. A creeping paralysis set in later, and the end  came swiftly when the dark days of the eighteenth century blotted out  even the memory of a great past. And yet during all this time the  people, the poor and middle classes, the yeomen and farmers, were ever  building, building, quietly and simply, untroubled by any thoughts  of style, of Gothic art or Renaissance; hence the cottages and  dwellings of the humblest type maintained in all their integrity the  real principles that made medieval architecture great.

Summary of Conclusions_    1. Sexual immorality among juveniles has become a world-wide problem of  increasing importance, but the great majority of the young people of  this Dominion are healthy-minded and well-behaved.    2. As sexual immorality is generally clandestine, is often not criminal,  and even when criminal may not be detected, there are not any statistics  from which it can be shown whether, or to what extent, it has increased.    3. During recent years the pattern of sexual misbehaviour has changed:  it has spread to younger groups; girls have become more precocious;  immorality has been organized; the mental attitude of some boys and  girls towards misconduct has altered; and there is evidence that  homosexuality may be increasing.    4. The new pattern of juvenile immorality is uncertain in origin,  insidious in growth, and has developed over a wide field.    5. Objectionable publications ought to be banned by establishing a  system for the registration of distributors of certain printed matter.  Urgent action is necessary so that publications now banned in other  countries will not be dumped into this Dominion.    6. The absence of regulations necessary to make the Film Censor's  recommendations effective deprives parents of the protection which the  Legislature intended for them.    7. The possibility that children may hear radio programmes unsuitable  for them calls for firmness and discretion on the part of parents and  more care by the Broadcasting Service in arranging and timing  programmes. Serials and recordings giving undue emphasis to crime or sex  are not desirable, nor is the frequent repetition of recordings that are  capable of misinterpretation, particularly in times like the present.    8. Advertisers should realize that the increasing emphasis on sex  attraction is objectionable to some and, possibly, harmful to others.    9. Although television may not be introduced into New Zealand for some  time, plans to cope with its effects on children should be made well in  advance of its introduction.    10. There should be a closer bond between school and home. The system of  visiting teachers should be expanded and as much liaison as possible  established between them and public health nurses.    11. The evidence that the propinquity of boys and girls at  co-educational schools contributed to sexual delinquency was not  convincing.    12. The value of insisting upon all children remaining at school till  they are 15 years of age should be further investigated. When the  underlying cause for an application for exemption is misconduct, the  exemption should only be granted subject to supervision by a Child  Welfare Officer.    13. Whenever a pupil under the care or supervision of the Child Welfare  Division is enrolled at a school the principal should be informed of any  matters pertaining to the pupil which are within the knowledge of that  Division. He should also be consulted as to any recommendation which it  is proposed to make to the Court in respect of any of his pupils.    14. The school is not the proper place for fully instructing children  about sex, although it may be a convenient place in which mothers and  daughters together, fathers and sons together, or parents together, may  listen to addresses or see appropriate films. This would help to break  down some of the barriers of self-consciousness.    15. In the new housing settlements the younger age groups predominate.  They are without the stabilizing influence of older people and  established institutions.    16. The work of all organizations which aim at building character is  warmly commended as they help to prevent children from becoming  delinquent; but facilities for recreation and entertainment will not  cure juvenile delinquency.    17. Liquor and gambling are symptomatic of some homes where there is  child neglect. The Committee deprecates the growing practice of parents  conniving at the consumption of liquor at young people's parties.    18. Tension in the household, separation of the parents, lack of  training for parenthood, the absence of a parental sense of  responsibility or poor discipline all help to create an unsatisfactory  home environment; the child of such a home often feels unwanted or  unloved. This unsatisfactory environment or feeling of being unloved is  productive of much delinquency.    19. Nearly one-third of the delinquent children whose cases were  considered came from homes where the mothers, possibly out of necessity,  went out to work. Fathers themselves are also to blame when they neglect  the opportunities available in the evenings or at the weekends to  interest themselves in the welfare of their children.    20. The high wages paid to adolescents on leaving school are an  important contributing factor especially when those youths have not been  trained in the virtues of thrift and self-reliance.    21. In many of the cases investigated by the police the children have  either been ignorant of the functions of sex or have too advanced a  knowledge of its physical aspects. When, how, and by whom the  information should be given is very important.    22. The present state of morals in the community has indicated the value  of a religious faith, and of family religion. Encouragement should be  given to the work of the New Zealand Council of Christian Education.    23. There has been a decline in certain aspects of family life because  of a failure to appreciate the worth of religious and moral sanctions.    24. During the past forty years new concepts have entered into society.  These concepts resulted from the unsettlement following two world wars.  The changes were the increased use of contraceptives, the broadening of  the divorce laws, an increase in pre-marital sexual relations, and the  spread of new psychological ideas.    25. The Committee is unanimously of the opinion that adolescents should  not buy or be in possession of contraceptives. There is, however, some  difference of opinion as to how this decision could be made effective.    26. The state of the law regarding indecent conduct on the part of boys  and girls operates very unfairly. Boys who admit this offence are  charged in the Children's Court under sections of the Crimes Act for  breach of which they are liable to terms of imprisonment of five to  seven years. Their names and particulars of the offence are recorded in  the _Police Gazette_. The girls (some of whom may have incited the boys  to offend) cannot be charged; if they are brought before the Court at  all, it is only when their parents are summoned"]]]
