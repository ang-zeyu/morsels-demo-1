The severity of the losses sustained, the overpowering  effects of the French artillery, began from this moment to be noted in  the German pocketbooks with veritable terror. Hope revived, however, at  the end of some weeks, and there is to be found in the letters of  soldiers and officers the announcement of \"a great movement\" which is  being prepared, and which is to lead the German armies anew as far as  Paris.      LOSSES IN \"BATTLE OF CALAIS.\"    This is the great \"battle of Calais,\" which, contrary to the  anticipations of the enemy, was in reality fought to the east of the  Yser. The losses of the Germans, which during those ten days exceeded  150,000 men, and may perhaps have reached 200,000, produced a terrifying  impression on the troops. From that moment prisoners no longer declared  themselves sure of success. For a certain time they had been consoled  by the announcement of the capture of Warsaw. This pretended success  having proved to be fictitious, incredulity became general.    During the last two months the most intelligent of the prisoners have  all admitted that no one could any longer say on which side victory  would rest. If we think of the absolute confidence with which the German  people had been sustained, this avowal is of great importance.    Letters seized on a dead officer speak of the imminence of a military  and economic hemming-in of Germany. They discuss the possibility of  Germany finding herself after the war with \"empty hands and pockets  turned inside out.\" There is no longer any question of imposing the  conqueror's law upon adversaries at his mercy, but of fighting with the  energy of despair to secure an honorable peace. An officer of the  General Staff who was made prisoner on Jan. 18 said: \"Perhaps this  struggle of despair has already begun.\"    _There follows a chapter bearing the title, \"The System of Lies,\" in  which the review describes the methods by which it is alleged the German  Government \"made a sustained effort to create in the army an artificial  state of mind based entirely upon lies and a scientific system of  fables.\"_          SONNET ON THE BELGIAN EXPATRIATION.    By THOMAS HARDY.    [From King Albert's Book.]          I dreamt that people from the Land of Chimes        Arrived one Autumn morning with their bells,        To hoist them on the towers and citadels      Of my own country, that the musical rhymes        Rung by them into space at measured times        Amid the market's daily stir and stress,        And the night's empty starlit silentness,      Might solace souls of this and kindred climes.        Then I awoke; and, lo, before me stood      The visioned ones, but pale and full of fear;      From Bruges they came, and Antwerp, and Ostend,        No carillons in their train. Vicissitude      Had left these tinkling to the invaders' ear,      And ravaged street, and smoldering gable-end.          War Correspondence    A Month of German Submarine War    By Vice Admiral Kirchhoff of the German Navy           Under the heading, \"A Month of U-Boat War,\" Vice Admiral       Kirchhoff of the German Navy discusses the German submarine       warfare against merchant shipping in its first month. The       article, appearing in the Hamburger Framdenblatt of March 19,       1915, is reproduced:    On March 18 a month had passed since the beginning of our sharp  procedure against our worst foe. We can in every way be satisfied with  the results achieved in the meantime! In spite of all \"steps\" taken  before and thereafter, the English have everywhere had important losses  to show at sea--some 200 ships lost since the beginning of the war,  according to the latest statements of the Allies--so that even they  themselves no longer dare to talk about the \"German bluff.\"    On the new and greater \"war zone\" established by us, our submarines have  known how to work bravely, and have been able, for instance, to operate  successfully on a single morning on the east coast, in the Channel, and  in the Irish Sea. We have heard of many losses of our opponents, and on  the other hand of the subjugation of only two of our brave U-boats.  Ceaselessly they are active on the coasts of Albion; shipping is  paralyzed at some points; steamship companies--including also many  neutral ones--have suspended their sailings; in short, our threat of a  more acute condition of war \"with all means at hand\" has been fully  fulfilled.    The \"peaceful shipping,\" too, has taken notice of it and adjusted itself  according to our instructions. The official objections of neutrals have  died away without effect; throughout the world we have already been  given right; the shipping circles of the neutral States are in great  part holding entirely back. The empty threats that floated over to us  from across the Channel, that the captured crews of German submarines  will be treated differently than other prisoners--yes, as plain pirates  and sea robbers--those are nothing but an insignificant ebullition of  British \"moral insanity.\" They are a part of the hypocritical cant  without which, somehow, Great Britain cannot get along. If Great Britain  should act in accordance with it, however, then we shall know what we,  for our part, have to do!    German and probably English mines, too, have helped our submarines in  clearing up among the English mercantile and war fleet. Many merchant  ships warned long in advance have been compelled to believe in the  warning, and with them frequently a great part of their crews--\"without  any warning whatever,\" as our opponents like to say.    All measures of defense, yes, even more significant, all measures of  deception and boastful \"ruses de guerre,\" and even all attempts to hush  up the news of German accomplishments and whenever possible to suppress  it completely--all these efforts have been futile. Our results surpass  the expectations that had been cherished. Who knows how many  accomplishments other than those which have been published may also have  been achieved? Foreign newspapers report a large number of steamships  overdue. From overseas likewise we receive favorable reports about the  sinking of enemy ships. But the best is the news that our submarines  have succeeded in sinking two English auxiliary cruisers and perhaps  also one or two larger English transport ships with several thousand men  on board.    The last announcement has filled us all with greatest satisfaction.  This, our latest method of warfare, is \"truly humane\"; it leads more  speedily to the goal than anything else, so that the number of victims  will in the end be smaller after all. It brings peace to all of us  sooner than the empty paper protests and crying to Heaven about violence  and international law, law of the sea, and laws of humanity could do.  In the innocent exalted island kingdom many a fellow is already  striking; why should not even the recruit strike, who is also beginning  to get a glimmer of the truth that there are no props in the ocean  waves?    The more opponents come before the bows of our ships and are sunk, the  better! Down with them to the bottom of the sea; that alone will help!  Let us hope that we shall soon receive more such cheerful news.          Three Weeks of the War in Champagne    By a British Observer      _The following article, issued by the British Press Bureau, London,  March 18, 1915, is from a British observer with the French forces in the  field who has the permission of General Joffre to send communications  home from time to time, giving descriptions of the work, &c., of the  French Army which will be of interest to the British reader._    I propose to give some account of the operations which have been in  progress for the last three weeks in Champagne. Every day since Feb. 15  the official communiques find something to say about a district which  lies midway between Rheims and Verdun. The three places which are always  mentioned, which form the points of reference, are Perthes-lez-Hurlus,  Le Mesnil-lez-Hurlus, and Beausejour Farm. The distance between the  first and the last is three and one-half miles; the front on which the  fighting has taken place is about five miles; and the French have been  attacking at one point or another in this front every day for the last  three weeks. It is, therefore, an operation of a different kind to those  which we have seen during the Winter months. Those were local efforts,  lasting a day or two, designed to keep the enemy busy and prevent him  from withdrawing troops elsewhere; this is a sustained effort, made with  the object of keeping a constant pressure on his first line of defense,  of affecting his use of the railway from Bazancourt to Challerange, a  few miles to the north, and of wearing down his reserves of men and  ammunition. It may be said that Feb. 15 marks the opening of the 1915  campaign, and that this first phase will find an important place when  the history of the war comes to be written.    We must first know something of the nature of the country, which is  entirely different to that in which the British Army is fighting. It is  one vast plain, undulating, the hills at most 200 feet higher than the  valleys, gentle slopes everywhere. The soil is rather chalky, poor,  barely worth cultivating; after heavy rain the whole plain becomes a sea  of shallow mud; and it dries equally quickly. The only features are the  pine woods, which have been planted by hundreds. From the point of view  of profit, this would not appear to have been a success; either the soil  is too poor, or else it is unsuitable to the maritime pine; for the  trees are rarely more than 25 feet high. As each rise is topped, a new  stretch of plain, a new set of small woods appear, just like that which  has been left behind.    [Illustration: ELEUTHERIOS K.

III.    AMERICA FOR HUMANITY.    [_President Wilson's address to the Mayor's Committee in New York, May  17, 1915, on the occasion of the naval parade and review in the  Hudson:_]    Mr. Mayor, Mr. Secretary, Admiral Fletcher, and Gentlemen of the Fleet:  This is not an occasion upon which it seems to me that it would be wise  for me to make many remarks, but I would deprive myself of a great  gratification if I did not express my pleasure in being here, my  gratitude for the splendid reception which has been accorded me as the  representative of the nation, and my profound interest in the navy of  the United States. That is an interest with which I was apparently born,  for it began when I was a youngster and has ripened with my knowledge of  the affairs and policies of the United States.    I think it is a natural, instinctive judgment of the people of the  United States that they express their power appropriately in an  efficient navy, and their interest is partly, I believe, because that  navy somehow is expected to express their character, not within our own  borders where that character is understood, but outside our borders,  where it is hoped we may occasionally touch others with some slight  vision of what America stands for.    But before I speak of the navy of the United States I want to take  advantage of the first public opportunity I have had to speak of the  Secretary of the Navy, to express my confidence and my admiration, and  to say that he has my unqualified support, for I have counseled with  him in intimate fashion. I know how sincerely he has it at heart that  everything that the navy does and handles should be done and handled as  the people of the United States wish them handled--because efficiency is  something more than organization. Efficiency runs into every  well-considered detail of personnel and method. Efficiency runs to the  extent of lifting the ideals of a service above every personal interest.  So that when I speak my support of the Secretary of the Navy I am merely  speaking my support of what I know every true lover of the navy to  desire and to purpose, for the navy of the United States is a body  specially trusted with the ideal of America.    I like to image in my thought this ideal. These quiet ships lying in the  river have no suggestion of bluster about them--no intimation of  aggression. They are commanded by men thoughtful of the duty of citizens  as well as the duty of officers--men acquainted with the traditions of  the great service to which they belong--men who know by touch with the  people of the United States what sort of purposes they ought to  entertain and what sort of discretion they ought to exercise in order to  use those engines of force as engines to promote the interests of  humanity.    For the interesting and inspiring thing about America, gentlemen, is  that she asks nothing for herself except what she has a right to ask for  humanity itself. We want no nation's property; we wish to question no  nation's honor; we wish to stand selfishly in the way of the development  of no nation; we want nothing that we cannot get by our own legitimate  enterprise and by the inspiration of our own example, and, standing for  these things, it is not pretention on our part to say that we are  privileged to stand for what every nation would wish to stand for, and  speak for those things which all humanity must desire.    When I think of the flag that those ships carry, the only touch of color  about them, the only thing that moves as if it had a settled spirit in  it, in their solid structure, it seems to me I see alternate strips of  parchment upon which are written the rights of liberty and justice and  strips of blood spilt to vindicate those rights, and then, in the  corner, a prediction of the blue serene into which every nation may swim  which stands for these great things.    The mission of America is the only thing that a sailor or soldier should  think about; he has nothing to do with the formulation of her policy; he  is to support her policy, whatever it is--but he is to support her  policy in the spirit of herself, and the strength of our policy is that  we, who for the time being administer the affairs of this nation, do not  originate her spirit; we attempt to embody it; we attempt to realize it  in action we are dominated by it, we do not dictate it.    And so with every man in arms who serves the nation--he stands and waits  to do the thing which the nation desires. America sometimes seems  perhaps to forget her programs, or, rather, I would say that sometimes  those who represent her seem to forget her programs, but the people  never forget them. It is as startling as it is touching to see how  whenever you touch a principle you touch the hearts of the people of the  United States. They listen to your debates of policy, they determine  which party they will prefer to power, they choose and prefer as  ordinary men; but their real affection, their real force, their real  irresistible momentum, is for the ideas which men embody.    I never go on the streets of a great city without feeling that somehow I  do not confer elsewhere than on the streets with the great spirit of the  people themselves, going about their business, attending to the things  which concern them, and yet carrying a treasure at their hearts all the  while, ready to be stirred not only as individuals, but as members of a  great union of hearts that constitutes a patriotic people.    And so this sight in the river touches me merely as a symbol of that,  and it quickens the pulse of every man who realizes these things to have  anything to do with them. When a crisis occurs in this country,  gentlemen, it is as if you put your hand on the pulse of a dynamo, it is  as if the things which you were in connection with were spiritually  bred. You had nothing to do with them except, if you listen truly, to  speak the things that you hear. These things now brood over the river,  this spirit now moves with the men who represent the nation in the navy,  these things will move upon the waters in the manoeuvres; no threat  lifted against any man, against any nation, against any interest, but  just a great, solemn evidence that the force of America is the force of  moral principle, that there is not anything else that she loves and that  there is not anything else for which she will contend.          Two Ex-Presidents' Views      MR. ROOSEVELT SPEAKS.    [Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]    _SYRACUSE, N.Y., May 7.--Ex-President Roosevelt, after learning details  of the sinking of the Lusitania, made this statement late tonight:_    This represents not merely piracy, but piracy on a vaster scale of  murder than old-time pirates ever practiced. This is the warfare which  destroyed Louvain and Dinant and hundreds of men, women, and children in  Belgium. It is a warfare against innocent men, women, and children  traveling on the ocean, and our own fellow-countrymen and countrywomen,  who are among the sufferers.    It seems inconceivable that we can refrain from taking action in this  matter, for we owe it not only to humanity, but to our own national  self-respect.    _On May 9 a Syracuse dispatch to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _conveyed this  statement from Mr. Roosevelt:_    On the night of the day that the disaster occurred I called the  attention of our people to the fact that the sinking of the Lusitania  was not only an act of simple piracy, but that it represented piracy  accompanied by murder on a vaster scale than any old-time pirate had  ever practiced before being hanged for his misdeeds.    I called attention to the fact that this was merely the application on  the high seas, and at our expense, of the principles which when applied  on land had produced the innumerable hideous tragedies that have  occurred in Belgium and in Northern France.    I said that not only our duty to humanity at large but our duty to  preserve our own national self-respect demanded instant action on our  part and forbade all delay.    I can do little more than reiterate what I then said.    When the German decree establishing the war zone was issued, and of  course plainly threatened exactly the type of tragedy which has  occurred, our Government notified Germany that in the event of any such  wrongdoing at the expense of our citizens we would hold the German  Government to \"a strict accountability.\"    The use of this phrase, \"strict accountability,\" of course, must mean,  and can only mean, that action will be taken by us without an hour's  unnecessary delay. It was eminently proper to use the exact phrase that  was used, and, having used it, our own self-respect demands that we  forthwith abide by it.    _On May 11, following the report of President Wilson's speech at  Philadelphia, Mr. Roosevelt stated the course which he considered that  this country should adopt, reported as follows in a Syracuse dispatch  to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES:    Colonel Roosevelt announced today what action, in his opinion, this  country should take toward Germany because of the sinking of the  Lusitania. Colonel Roosevelt earnestly said that the time for  deliberation was past and that within twenty-four hours this country  could, and should, take effective action by declaring that all commerce  with Germany forthwith be forbidden and that all commerce of every kind  permitted and encouraged with France, England, and \"the rest of the  civilized world.\"    Colonel Roosevelt said that for America to take this step would not mean  war, as the"]]]
