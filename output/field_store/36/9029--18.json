By a similar course of reasoning the conclusion is reached  that the normal solution of sodium thiosulphate should contain,  per liter, its molecular weight in grams. As the thiosulphate in  crystalline form has the formula Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}.5H_{2}O, this weight  is 248.12 grams. Tenth-normal or hundredth-normal solutions are  generally used.      PREPARATION OF STANDARD SOLUTIONS    !Approximate Strength, 0.1 N!    PROCEDURE.--Weigh out on the rough balances 13 grams of commercial  iodine. Place it in a mortar with 18 grams of potassium iodide and  triturate with small portions of water until all is dissolved. Dilute  the solution to 1000 cc. and transfer to a liter bottle and mix  thoroughly (Note 1).[1]    [Footnote 1: It will be found more economical to have a considerable  quantity of the solution prepared by a laboratory attendant, and to  have all unused solutions returned to the common stock.]    Weigh out 25 grams of sodium thiosulphate, dissolve it in water which  has been previously boiled and cooled, and dilute to 1000 cc., also  with boiled water. Transfer the solution to a liter bottle and mix  thoroughly (Note 2).    [Note 1: Iodine solutions react with water to form hydriodic acid  under the influence of the sunlight, and even at low room temperatures  the iodine tends to volatilize from solution. They should, therefore,  be protected from light and heat. Iodine solutions are not stable for  long periods under the best of conditions. They cannot be used in  burettes with rubber tips, since they attack the rubber.]    [Note 2: Sodium thiosulphate (Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}.5H_{2}O) is  rarely wholly pure as sold commercially, but may be purified by  recrystallization. The carbon dioxide absorbed from the air by  distilled water decomposes the salt, with the separation of sulphur.  Boiled water which has been cooled out of contact with the air should  be used in preparing solutions.]      INDICATOR SOLUTION    The starch solution for use as an indicator must be freshly prepared.  A soluble starch is obtainable which serves well, and a solution of  0.5 gram of this starch in 25 cc. of boiling water is sufficient. The  solution should be filtered while hot and is ready for use when cold.    If soluble starch is not at hand, potato starch may be used. Mix about  1 gram with 5 cc. of cold water to a smooth paste, pour 150 cc. of  !boiling! water over it, warm for a moment on the hot plate, and put  it aside to settle. Decant the supernatant liquid through a filter  and use the clear filtrate; 5 cc. of this solution are needed for a  titration.    The solution of potato starch is less stable than the soluble starch.  The solid particles of the starch, if not removed by filtration,  become so colored by the iodine that they are not readily decolorized  by the thiosulphate (Note 1).    [Note 1: The blue color which results when free iodine and starch  are brought together is probably not due to the formation of a true  chemical compound. It is regarded as a \"solid solution\" of iodine in  starch. Although it is unstable, and easily destroyed by heat, it  serves as an indicator for the presence of free iodine of remarkable  sensitiveness, and makes the iodometric processes the most  satisfactory of any in the field of volumetric analysis.]      COMPARISON OF IODINE AND THIOSULPHATE SOLUTIONS    PROCEDURE.--Place the solutions in burettes (the iodine in a  glass-stoppered burette), observing the usual precautions. Run out 40  cc. of the thiosulphate solution into a beaker, dilute with 150 cc. of  water, add 1 cc. to 2 cc. of the soluble starch solution, and titrate  with the iodine to the appearance of the blue of the iodo-starch.  Repeat until the ratio of the two solutions is established,  remembering all necessary corrections for burettes and for temperature  changes.      STANDARDIZATION OF SOLUTIONS    Commercial iodine is usually not sufficiently pure to permit of its  use as a standard for thiosulphate solutions or the direct preparation  of a standard solution of iodine. It is likely to contain, beside  moisture, some iodine chloride, if chlorine was used to liberate the  iodine when it was prepared. It may be purified by sublimation after  mixing it with a little potassium iodide, which reacts with the iodine  chloride, forming potassium chloride and setting free the iodine. The  sublimed iodine is then dried by placing it in a closed container over  concentrated sulphuric acid. It may then be weighed in a stoppered  weighing-tube and dissolved in a solution of potassium iodide in a  stoppered flask to prevent loss of iodine by volatilization. About 18  grams of the iodide and twelve grams of iodine per liter are required  for an approximately tenth-normal solution.    An iodine solution made from commercial iodine may also be  standardized against arsenious oxide (As_{4}O_{6}). This substance  also usually requires purification by sublimation before use.    The substances usually employed for the standardization of a  thiosulphate solution are potassium bromate and metallic copper. The  former is obtainable in pure condition or may be easily purified by  re-crystallization. Copper wire of high grade is sufficiently pure  to serve as a standard. Both potassium bromate and cupric salts in  solution will liberate iodine from an iodide, which is then titrated  with the thiosulphate solution.    The reactions involved are the following:    (a) KBrO_{3} + 6KI + 3H_{2}SO_{4} --> KBr + 3I_{2} + 3K_{2}SO_{4} + 3H_{2}O,    (b) 3Cu + 8HNO_{3} --> 3Cu(NO_{3})_{2} + 2NO + 4H_{2}O,      2Cu(NO_{3})_{2} + 4KI --> 2CuI + 4KNO_{3} + I_{2}.    Two methods for the direct standardization of the sodium thiosulphate  solution are here described, and one for the direct standardization of  the iodine solution.      !Method A!    PROCEDURE.--Weigh out into 500 cc. beakers two portions of about  0.150-0.175 gram of potassium bromate. Dissolve each of these in 50  cc. of water, and add 10 cc. of a potassium iodide solution containing  3 grams of the salt in that volume (Note 1). Add to the mixture 10 cc.  of dilute sulphuric acid (1 volume of sulphuric acid with 5 volumes of  water), allow the solution to stand for three minutes, and dilute to  150 cc. (Note 2). Run in thiosulphate solution from a burette until  the color of the liberated iodine is nearly destroyed, and then add 1  cc. or 2 cc. of starch solution, titrate to the disappearance of the  iodo-starch blue, and finally add iodine solution until the color  is just restored. Make a blank test for the amount of thiosulphate  solution required to react with the iodine liberated by the iodate  which is generally present in the potassium iodide solution, and  deduct this from the total volume used in the titration.    From the data obtained, calculate the relation of the thiosulphate  solution to a normal solution, and subsequently calculate the similar  value for the iodine solution.    [Note 1:--Potassium iodide usually contains small amounts of potassium  iodate as impurity which, when the iodide is brought into an acid  solution, liberates iodine, just as does the potassium bromate used as  a standard. It is necessary to determine the amount of thiosulphate  which reacts with the iodine thus liberated by making a \"blank test\"  with the iodide and acid alone. As the iodate is not always uniformly  distributed throughout the iodide, it is better to make up a  sufficient volume of a solution of the iodide for the purposes of the  work in hand, and to make the blank test by using the same volume of  the iodide solution as is added in the standardizing process. The  iodide solution should contain about 3 grams of the salt in 10 cc.]    [Note 2: The color of the iodo-starch is somewhat less satisfactory in  concentrated solutions of the alkali salts, notably the iodides. The  dilution prescribed obviates this difficulty.]      !Method B!    PROCEDURE.--Weigh out two portions of 0.25-0.27 gram of clean copper  wire into 250 cc. Erlenmeyer flasks (Note 1). Add to each 5 cc. of  concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and 25 cc. of water, cover,  and warm until solution is complete. Add 5 cc. of bromine water and  boil until the excess of bromine is expelled. Cool, and add strong  ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90) drop by drop until a deep blue color indicates  the presence of an excess. Boil the solution until the deep blue is  replaced by a light bluish green, or a brown stain appears on the  sides of the flask (Note 2). Add 10 cc. of strong acetic acid (sp.  gr. 1.04), cool under the water tap, and add a solution of potassium  iodide (Note 3) containing about 3 grams of the salt, and titrate  with thiosulphate solution until the color of the liberated iodine  is nearly destroyed. Then add 1-2 cc. of freshly prepared starch  solution, and add thiosulphate solution, drop by drop, until the blue  color is discharged.    From the data obtained, including the \"blank test\" of the iodide,  calculate the relation of the thiosulphate solution to the normal.    [Note 1: While copper wire of commerce is not absolutely pure, the  requirements for its use as a conductor of electricity are such that  the impurities constitute only a few hundredths of one per cent and  are negligible for analytical purposes.]    [Note 2: Ammonia neutralizes the free nitric acid. It should be added  in slight excess only, since the excess must be removed by boiling,  which is tedious. If too much ammonia is present when acetic acid is  added, the resulting ammonium acetate is hydrolyzed, and the ammonium  hydroxide reacts with the iodine set free.]    [Note 3: A considerable excess of potassium iodide is necessary for  the prompt liberation of iodine. While a large excess will do no harm,  the cost of this reagent is so great that waste should be avoided.]      !Method C!
