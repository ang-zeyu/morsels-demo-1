Two zinc trays fit the top, upon which to place the  dish drainers. If preferred, the top might be arranged as a drainer, by  making it of well-seasoned hard wood, with a number of inclined grooves  to allow the water to run into the sink. If the house be heated by  steam, a plate-warmer is an important part of the pantry furnishing.    [Illustration: Compartment Sink for Dish-Washing. Open.]    THE STOREROOM.--If possible to do so, locate the room for the  keeping of the kitchen supplies on the cool side of the house. Plenty of  light, good ventilation, and absolute cleanliness are essential, as the  slightest contamination of air is likely to render the food supply unfit  for use.    The refrigerator should not be connected with the kitchen drain pipe,  and the greatest care should be taken to keep it clean and sweet. It  should be thoroughly scrubbed with borax or sal-soda and water, and well  aired, at least once a week. Strongly flavored foods and milk should not  be kept in the same refrigerator. The ice to be used should always be  carefully washed before putting in the refrigerator. Care should also be  taken to replenish it before the previous supply is entirely melted, as  the temperature rises when the ice becomes low, and double the quantity  will be required to cool the refrigerator that would be necessary to  keep it of uniform temperature if added before the ice was entirely out.    THE WATER SUPPLY.--The water used for drinking and cooking purposes  should receive equal consideration with the food supply, and from  whatever source obtained, it should be frequently tested for impurities,  since that which looks the most refreshing may be contaminated with  organic poison of the most treacherous character.    [Illustration: Compartment Sink for Dish-Washing. Closed.]    A good and simple test solution, which any housewife can use, may be  prepared by dissolving twelve grains of caustic potash and three of  permanganate of potash in an ounce of distilled water, or filtered soft  water. Add a drop of this solution to a glass of the water to be tested.  If the pink color imparted by the solution disappears at once, add  another drop of the solution, and continue adding drop by drop until the  pink color will remain for half an hour or more. The amount of the  solution necessary to security permanent color is very fair index to the  quality of the water. If the color imparted by the first one or two  drops disappears within a half hour, the water should be rejected as  probably dangerous. Water which is suspected of being impure may be  rendered safe by boiling. Filters are only of service in removing  suspended particles and the unpleasant taste of rain water; a really  dangerous water is not rendered safe by filtering in the ordinary  manner.    CELLARS.--Sanitarians tell us that cellars should never be built  under dwelling houses. Because of improper construction and neglect,  they are undoubtedly the cause of much disease and many deaths. A  basement beneath the house is advantageous, but the greatest of care  should be given to construct it in accord with sanitary laws. It should  be thoroughly drained that there may be no source of dampness, but  should not be connected with a sewer or a cesspool. It should have walls  so made as to be impervious to air and water. An ordinary brick or stone  wall is inefficient unless well covered with good Portland cement  polished smooth. The floors should likewise be covered with cement,  otherwise the cellar is likely to be filled with impure air derived from  the soil, commonly spoken of as \"ground air,\" and which offers a  constant menace to the health of those who live over cellars with  uncemented walls and floors.    Light and ventilation are quite as essential to the healthfulness of a  cellar as to other rooms of the dwelling. Constantly during warm  weather, and at least once a day during the winter season, windows  should be opened wide, thus effecting a free interchange of air. All  mold and mustiness should be kept out by thorough ventilation and  frequent coats of whitewash to the walls. Vegetables and other  decomposable articles, if stored in the basement, should be frequently  sorted, and all decaying substances promptly removed. This is of the  utmost importance, since the germs and foul gases arising from  decomposing food stuffs form a deadly source of contamination through  every crack and crevice.      KITCHEN CONVENIENCES.    In these days of invention and progress, much thought and ingenuity have  been expended in making and perfecting labor-saving articles and  utensils, which serve to make housework less of a burden and more of a  delight.    THE STEAM-COOKER.--One of the most unique of these conveniences is  the steam-cooker, one kind of which is illustrated by the accompanying  cut. Steaming is, for many foods, a most economical and satisfactory  method of cooking. Especially is this true respecting fruits, grains,  and vegetables, the latter of which often have the larger proportion of  their best nutritive elements dissolved and thrown away in the water in  which they are boiled. In the majority of households it is, however, the  method least depended upon, because the ordinary steamer over a pot of  boiling water requires too much attention, takes up too much stove room,  and creates too much steam in the kitchen, to prove a general favorite.  The steam-cooker has an escape-steam tube through which all excess of  steam and odors passes into the fire, and thus its different  compartments may contain and cook an entire dinner, if need be, and over  one stove hole or one burner of an oil or gasoline stove.    [Illustration: The Steam-Cooker.]    THE VEGETABLE PRESS.--The accompanying cut represents this handy  utensil, which is equally useful as a potato and vegetable masher; as a  sauce, gruel, and gravy strainer; as a fruit press, and for many other  purposes for which a colander or strainer is needed, while it economizes  both time and labor.    [Illustration: Vegetable Press.]    LEMON DRILL.--This little article for extracting the juice of the  lemon, and which can be purchased of most hardware dealers, is quite  superior to the more commonly used lemon squeezer. Being made of glass,  its use is not open to the danger that the use of metal squeezer is are  from poisonous combinations of the acid and metal, while the juice  extracted is free from pulp, seeds, and the oil of the skin.    [Illustration: Lemon Drill.]    A HANDY WAITER.--In many households where no help is employed, a  labor-saving device like the one represented in the accompanying  illustration, will be found of great service. It is a light double table  on easy-rolling casters, and can be readily constructed by anyone handy  in the use of tools. If preferred, the top may be covered with zinc. In  setting or clearing the table, the dishes may be placed on the lower  shelf, with the food on the top, and the table rolled from pantry to  dining room, and from dining room to kitchen; thus accomplishing, with  one trip, what is ordinarily done with hundreds of steps by the weary  housewife. If desirable to reset the table at once after a meal, the  waiter will be found most serviceable as a place whereon the glassware  and silverware may be washed. It is equally serviceable for holding the  utensils and material needed when cooking; being so easily moved, they  can be rolled to the stove and is always convenient.    [Illustration: The Handy Waiter.]    WALL CABINET.--where cupboard space is limited, or where for  convenience it is desirable to have some provision for supplies and  utensils near the range and baking table, a wall cabinet offers a most  convenient arrangement. It may be made of a size to fit in any  convenient niche, and constructed plainly or made as ornamental as one  pleases, with doors to exclude the dust, shelves on which to keep tin  cans filled with rice, oatmeal, cracked wheat, and other grains; glass  jars of raisins, sugar, citron, cornstarch, etc.; hooks on which may  hang the measures, egg-beater, potato masher, and such frequently needed  utensils; and with drawers for paring knives, spoons, and similar  articles, the wall cabinet becomes a _multum in parvo_ of convenience  which would greatly facilitate work in many households.    [Illustration: Wall Cabinet.]    PERCOLATE HOLDER.--The accompanying cut illustrates an  easily-constructed device for holding a jelly bag or percolate. It may  be so made as to be easily screwed to any ordinary table, and will save  the housekeeper far more than its cost in time and patience.    KNEADING TABLE.--Much of the tiresome labor of bread-making can be  avoided if one is supplied with some convenient table similar to the one  represented in the cut, wherein the needed material and utensils may be  kept in readiness at all times. The table illustrated has two large tin  drawers, each divided into two compartments, in which may be kept corn  meal, entire wheat, and Graham and white flours. Two drawers above  provide a place for rolling-pin, bread mallet, gem irons, spoons, etc.,  while a narrow compartment just beneath the hardwood top affords a place  for the kneading board. The table being on casters is easily moved to  any part of the kitchen for use.    [Illustration: Percolater Holder.]    [Illustration: Kneading Table.]    DISH-TOWEL RACK.--Nothing adds more to the ease and facility with  which the frequent dish-washings of the household may be accomplished  than clean, well-dried towels. For quick drying,--an item of great  importance if one would keep the towels fresh and sweet,--the towel rack  represented in the cut, and which can be made by any carpenter, is a  most handy device. When not in use, it can be turned up against the wall  as illustrated. It is light, affords sufficient drying space so that no  towel need be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#16)"],[1,"pray!            VI.    SONG.    Summer for thee grant I may be    When summer days are flown!  Thy music still when whippoorwill    And oriole are done!    For thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb    And sow my blossoms o'er!  Pray gather me, Anemone,    Thy flower forevermore!            VII.    LOYALTY.    Split the lark and you'll find the music,    Bulb after bulb, in silver rolled,  Scantily dealt to the summer morning,    Saved for your ear when lutes be old.    Loose the flood, you shall find it patent,    Gush after gush, reserved for you;  Scarlet experiment! sceptic Thomas,    Now, do you doubt that your bird was true?            VIII.    To lose thee, sweeter than to gain    All other hearts I knew.  'T is true the drought is destitute,    But then I had the dew!    The Caspian has its realms of sand,    Its other realm of sea;  Without the sterile perquisite    No Caspian could be.            IX.      Poor little heart!    Did they forget thee?  Then dinna care! Then dinna care!      Proud little heart!    Did they forsake thee?  Be debonair! Be debonair!      Frail little heart!    I would not break thee:  Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me?      Gay little heart!    Like morning glory  Thou'll wilted be; thou'll wilted be!            X.    FORGOTTEN.    There is a word    Which bears a sword    Can pierce an armed man.  It hurls its barbed syllables,--    At once is mute again.  But where it fell  The saved will tell    On patriotic day,  Some epauletted brother    Gave his breath away.    Wherever runs the breathless sun,    Wherever roams the day,  There is its noiseless onset,    There is its victory!    Behold the keenest marksman!    The most accomplished shot!  Time's sublimest target    Is a soul 'forgot'!            XI.    I've got an arrow here;    Loving the hand that sent it,  I the dart revere.    Fell, they will say, in 'skirmish'!    Vanquished, my soul will know,  By but a simple arrow    Sped by an archer's bow.            XII.    THE MASTER.    He fumbles at your spirit    As players at the keys  Before they drop full music on;    He stuns you by degrees,    Prepares your brittle substance    For the ethereal blow,  By fainter hammers, further heard,    Then nearer, then so slow    Your breath has time to straighten,    Your brain to bubble cool, --  Deals one imperial thunderbolt    That scalps your naked soul.            XIII.    Heart, we will forget him!    You and I, to-night!  You may forget the warmth he gave,    I will forget the light.    When you have done, pray tell me,    That I my thoughts may dim;  Haste! lest while you're lagging,    I may remember him!            XIV.    Father, I bring thee not myself, --    That were the little load;  I bring thee the imperial heart    I had not strength to hold.    The heart I cherished in my own    Till mine too heavy grew,  Yet strangest, heavier since it went,    Is it too large for you?            XV.    We outgrow love like other things    And put it in the drawer,  Till it an antique fashion shows    Like costumes grandsires wore.            XVI.    Not with a club the heart is broken,      Nor with a stone;  A whip, so small you could not see it.      I've known    To lash the magic creature      Till it fell,  Yet that whip's name too noble      Then to tell.    Magnanimous of bird      By boy descried,  To sing unto the stone      Of which it died.            XVII.    WHO?    My friend must be a bird,      Because it flies!  Mortal my friend must be,      Because it dies!  Barbs has it, like a bee.  Ah, curious friend,      Thou puzzlest me!            XVIII.    He touched me, so I live to know  That such a day, permitted so,    I groped upon his breast.  It was a boundless place to me,  And silenced, as the awful sea    Puts minor streams to rest.    And now, I'm different from before,  As if I breathed superior air,    Or brushed a royal gown;  My feet, too, that had wandered so,  My gypsy face transfigured now    To tenderer renown.            XIX.    DREAMS.    Let me not mar that perfect dream    By an auroral stain,  But so adjust my daily night    That it will come again.            XX.    NUMEN LUMEN.    I live with him, I see his face;    I go no more away  For visitor, or sundown;    Death's single privacy,    The only one forestalling mine,    And that by right that he  Presents a claim invisible,    No wedlock granted me.    I live with him, I hear his voice,    I stand alive to-day  To witness to the certainty    Of immortality    Taught me by Time, -- the lower way,    Conviction every day, --  That life like this is endless,    Be judgment what it may.            XXI.    LONGING.    I envy seas whereon he rides,    I envy spokes of wheels  Of chariots that him convey,    I envy speechless hills    That gaze upon his journey;    How easy all can see  What is forbidden utterly    As heaven, unto me!    I envy nests of sparrows    That dot his distant eaves,  The wealthy fly upon his pane,    The happy, happy leaves    That just abroad his window    Have summer's leave to be,  The earrings of Pizarro    Could not obtain for me.    I envy light that wakes him,    And bells that boldly ring  To tell him it is noon abroad, --    Myself his noon could bring,    Yet interdict my blossom    And abrogate my bee,  Lest noon in everlasting night    Drop Gabriel and me.            XXII.    WEDDED.    A solemn thing it was, I said,    A woman white to be,  And wear, if God should count me fit,    Her hallowed mystery.    A timid thing to drop a life    Into the purple well,  Too plummetless that it come back    Eternity until.                    III. NATURE.      I.    NATURE'S CHANGES.    The springtime's pallid landscape    Will glow like bright bouquet,  Though drifted deep in parian    The village lies to-day.    The lilacs, bending many a year,    With purple load will hang;  The bees will not forget the tune    Their old forefathers sang.    The rose will redden in the bog,    The aster on the hill  Her everlasting fashion set,    And covenant gentians frill,    Till summer folds her miracle    As women do their gown,  Or priests adjust the symbols    When sacrament is done.            II.    THE TULIP.    She slept beneath a tree    Remembered but by me.  I touched her cradle mute;  She recognized the foot,  Put on her carmine suit, --    And see!            III.    A light exists in spring    Not present on the year  At any other period.    When March is scarcely here    A color stands abroad    On solitary hills  That science cannot overtake,    But human nature feels.    It waits upon the lawn;    It shows the furthest tree  Upon the furthest slope we know;    It almost speaks to me.    Then, as horizons step,    Or noons report away,  Without the formula of sound,    It passes, and we stay:    A quality of loss    Affecting our content,  As trade had suddenly encroached    Upon a sacrament.            IV.    THE WAKING YEAR.    A lady red upon the hill    Her annual secret keeps;  A lady white within the field    In placid lily sleeps!    The tidy breezes with their brooms    Sweep vale, and hill, and tree!  Prithee, my pretty housewives!    Who may expected be?    The neighbors do not yet suspect!    The woods exchange a smile --  Orchard, and buttercup, and bird --    In such a little while!    And yet how still the landscape stands,    How nonchalant the wood,  As if the resurrection    Were nothing very odd!            V.    TO MARCH.    Dear March, come in!  How glad I am!  I looked for you before.  Put down your hat --  You must have walked --  How out of breath you are!  Dear March, how are you?  And the rest?  Did you leave Nature well?  Oh, March, come right upstairs with me,  I have so much to tell!    I got your letter, and the birds';  The maples never knew  That you were coming, -- I declare,  How red their faces grew!  But, March, forgive me --  And all those hills  You left for me to hue;  There was no purple suitable,  You took it all with you.    Who knocks? That April!  Lock the door!  I will not be pursued!  He stayed away a year, to call  When I am occupied.  But trifles look so trivial  As soon as you have come,  That blame is just as dear as praise  And praise as mere as blame.            VI.    MARCH.    We like March, his shoes are purple,    He is new and high;  Makes he mud for dog and peddler,    Makes he forest dry;  Knows the adder's tongue his coming,    And begets her spot.  Stands the sun so close and mighty    That our minds are hot.  News is he of all the others;    Bold it were to die  With the blue-birds buccaneering    On his British sky.          VII.    DAWN.    Not knowing when the dawn will come    I open every door;  Or has it feathers like a bird,    Or billows like a shore?            VIII.    A murmur in the trees to note,    Not loud enough for wind;  A star not far enough to seek,    Nor near enough to find;    A long, long yellow on the lawn,    A hubbub as of feet;  Not audible, as ours to us,    But dapperer, more sweet;    A hurrying home of little men    To houses unperceived, --  All this, and more, if I should tell,    Would never be believed.    Of robins in the trundle bed    How many I espy  Whose nightgowns could not hide the wings,    Although I heard them try!    But then I promised ne'er to tell;    How could I break my word?  So go your way and I'll go mine, --    No fear you'll miss the road.            IX.    Morning is the place for dew,    Corn is made at noon,  After dinner light for flowers,    Dukes for setting sun!            X.    To my quick ear the leaves conferred;    The bushes they were bells;  I could not find a privacy    From Nature's sentinels.    In cave if I presumed to hide,    The walls began to tell;  Creation seemed a mighty crack    To make me visible.            XI.    A ROSE.    A sepal, petal, and a thorn    Upon a common summer's morn,  A flash of dew, a bee or two,  A breeze  A caper in the trees, --    And I'm a "]]]
