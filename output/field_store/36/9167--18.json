Then, with the emotion past, and face to face with staggering  consequences, she had reacted to conscious instincts. She had proved  the purity of her surrender. She was all mother. And Lane began to see  her moving in a crystal, beautiful light.    For what seemed a long time Lane remained motionless there in the  silence of the meadow. Then at length he arose and retraced his slow  steps back to town. Darkness overtook him on the bridge that spanned  Middleville River. He leaned over the railing and peered down into the  shadows. A soft murmur of rushing water came up. How like strange  distant voices calling him to go back or go on, or warning him, or  giving mystic portent of something that would happen to him there! A  cold chill crept over him and he seemed enveloped in a sombre menace  of the future. But he shook it off. He had many battles to fight, not  the least of which was with morbid imagination.    When he reached the center of town he entered the lobby of the  Bradford Inn. He hoped to meet Blair Maynard there. A company of  well-dressed youths and men filled the place, most of whom appeared to  be making a merry uproar.    Lane observed two men who evidently were the focus of attention. One  was a stranger, very likely a traveling man, and at the moment he  presented a picture of mingled consternation and anger. He was  brushing off his clothes while glaring at a little, stout, red-faced  man who appeared about to be stricken by apoplexy. This latter was a  Colonel Pepper, whose acquaintance Lane had recently made. He was fond  of cards and sport, and appeared to be a favorite with the young men  about town. Moreover he had made himself particularly agreeable to  Lane, in fact to the extent of Lane's embarrassment. At this moment  the stranger lost his consternation wholly in wrath, and made a  threatening movement toward Pepper. Lane stepped between them just in  time to save Pepper a blow.    \"I know what he's done. I apologize for him,\" said Lane, to the  stranger. \"He's made a good many people victims of the same indignity.  It's a weakness--a disease. He can't help himself. Pray overlook it.\"    The stranger appeared impressed with Lane's presence, probably with  his uniform, and slowly shook himself and fell back, to glower at  Pepper, and curse under his breath, still uncertain of himself.    Lane grasped Colonel Pepper and led him out of the lobby.    \"Pepper, you're going to get in an awful mess with that stunt of  yours,\" he declared, severely. \"If you can't help it you ought at  least pick on your friends, or the town people--not strangers.\"    \"Have--a--drink,\" sputtered Pepper, with his hand at his hip.    \"No, thanks.\"    \"Have--a--cigar.\"    Lane laughed. He had been informed that Colonel Pepper's failing  always took this form of remorse, and certainly he would have tried it  upon his latest victim had not Lane interfered.    \"Colonel, you're hopeless,\" said Lane, as they walked out. \"I hope  somebody will always be around to protect you. I'd carry a body  guard.... Say, have you seen Blair Maynard or Holt Dalrymple  to-night?\"    \"Not Blair, but Holt was here early with the boys,\" replied Pepper.  \"They've gone to the club rooms to have a little game. I'm going to  sit in. Lately I had to put up a holler. If the boys quit cards how'm  I to make a living?\"    \"Had Holt been drinking?\"    \"Not to-night. But he's been hitting the bottle pretty hard of late.\"    Suddenly Lane buttonholed the little man and peered down earnestly at  him. \"Pepper, I've been trying to straighten Holt up. He's going to  the bad. But he's a good kid. It's only the company.... The fact  is--this's strictly confidential, mind you--Holt's sister begged me to  try to stop his drinking and gambling. I think I can do it, too, with  a little help. Now, Pepper, I'm asking you to help me.\"    \"Ahuh! Well, let's go in the writing room, where we can talk,\" said  the other, and he took hold of Lane's arm. When they were seated in a  secluded corner he lighted a cigar, and faced Lane with shrewd, kindly  eyes. \"Son, I like you and Blair as well as I hate these slackers  Swann and Mackay, and their crowd. I could tell you a heap, and maybe  help you, though I think young Holt is not a bad egg.... Is his sister  the dark one who steps so straight and holds herself so well?\"    \"Yes, that sounds like Dorothy,\" replied Lane.    \"She's about the only one I know who doesn't paint her face and I  never saw her at--well, never mind where. But the fact I mean makes  her stand out in this Middleville crowd like a light in the dark....  Lane, have you got on yet to the speed of the young people of this old  burg?\"    \"I'm getting on, to my sorrow,\" said Lane.    \"Ahuh! You mean you're getting wise to your kid sister?\"    \"Yes, I'm sorry to say. What do you know, Pepper?\"    \"Now, son, wait. I'm coming to that, maybe. But I want to know some  things first. Is it true--what I hear about your health, bad shape,  you know--all cut up in the war? Worse than young Maynard?\"    Pepper's hand was close on Lane's. He had forgotten his cigar. His  eyes were earnest.    \"True?\" laughed Lane, grimly. \"Yes, it's true.... I won't last long,  Pepper, according to Doctor Bronson. That's why I want to make hay  while the sun shines.\"    \"Ahuh!\" Pepper cleared his throat. \"Forgive this, boy.... Is it also  true you were engaged to marry that Helen Wrapp--and she threw you  down, while you were over there?\"    \"Yes, that's perfectly true,\" replied Lane, soberly.    \"God, I guess maybe the soldier wasn't up against it!\" ejaculated  Pepper, with a gesture of mingled awe and wonder and scorn.    \"What was the soldier up against, Pepper?\" queried Lane. \"Frankly, I  don't know.\"    \"Lane, the government jollied and forced the boys into the army,\"  replied Pepper. \"The country went wild with patriotism. The soldiers  were heroes. The women threw themselves away on anything inside a  uniform. Make the world safe for democracy--down the Hun--save France  and England--ideals, freedom, God's country, and all that! Well, the  first few soldiers to return from France got a grand reception, were  made heroes of. They were lucky to get back while the sentiment was  hot. But that didn't last.... Now, a year and more after the war,  where does the soldier get off? Lane, there're over six hundred  thousand of you disabled veterans, and for all I can read and find out  the government has done next to nothing. New York is full of begging  soldiers--on the streets. Think of it! And the poor devils are dying  everywhere. My God! think of what's in the mind of one crippled  soldier, let alone over half a million. I just have a dim idea of what  I'd felt. You must know, or you will know, Lane, for you seem a  thoughtful, lofty sort of chap. Just the kind to make a good soldier,  because you had ideals and nerve!... Well, a selfish and weak  administration could hardly be expected to keep extravagant promises  to patriots. But that the American public, as a body, should now be  sick of the sight of a crippled soldier--and that his sweetheart  should turn him down!--this is the hideous blot, the ineradicable  shame, the stinking truth, the damned mystery!\"    When Pepper ended his speech, which grew more vehement toward the  close, Lane could only stare at him in amaze.    \"See here, Lane,\" added the other hastily, \"pardon me for blowing up.  I just couldn't help it. I took a shine to you--and to see you like  this--brings back the resentment I've had all along. I'm blunt, but  it's just as well for you to be put wise quick. You'll find friends,  like me, who will stand by you, if you let them. But you'll also find  that most of this rotten world has gone back on you....\"    Then Pepper made a sharp, passionate gesture that broke his cigar  against the arm of his chair, and he cursed low and deep. Presently he  addressed Lane again. \"Whatever comes of any disclosures I  make--whatever you _do_--you'll not give me away?\"    \"Certainly not. You can trust me, Pepper,\" returned Lane.    \"Son, I'm a wise old guy. There's not much that goes on in Middleville  I don't get on to. And I'll make your hair curl. But I'll confine  myself to what comes closest home to you. I _get_ you, Lane. You're  game. You're through. You have come back from war to find a hell of a  mess. Your own sister--your sweetheart--your friend's brother and  your soldier pard's sister--on the primrose path! And you with your  last breath trying to turn them back! I'll say it's a damn fine stunt.  I'm an old gambler, Lane. I've lived in many towns and mixed in tough  crowds of crooked men and rotten women. But I'm here to confess that  this after-the-war stuff of Middleville's better class has knocked out  about all the faith I had left in human nature.... Then you came along  to teach me a lesson.\"    \"Well, Pepper, that's strong talk,\" returned Lane. \"But cut it, and  hurry to--to what comes home to me. What's the matter with these  Middleville girls?\"    \"Lane, any intelligent man, who _knows_ things, and who can think for  himself, will tell you this--that to judge from the dress, dance,  talk, conduct of these young girls--most of them have _apparently_  gone wrong.\"    \"You include our nice girls--from what we used to call Middleville's  best families?\"    \"I don't only include them. I throw the emphasis on them. The girls  you know best.\"    Lane straightened up, to look at his companion. Pepper certainly was  not drunk.    \"Do you know--anything about Lorna?\"    \"Nothing specifically to prove anything. She's in the thick of this  thing in Middleville. Only a few nights ago I saw her at a roadhouse,  out on the State Road, with a crowd of youngsters. They were having a  high old time, I'll say. They danced jazz, and I saw Lorna drink  lemonade into which liquor had been poured from a hip-pocket flask.\"    Lane put his head on his"]]]
