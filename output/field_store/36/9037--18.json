In person Suwarrow was  unlike what the imagination would picture. He was but five feet one  inch in height, and of a fragile form; his mouth was large, and his  features plain; but his countenance was full of fire, vivacity, and  penetration. When he was moved, it became severe, commanding, and even  terrible; but this seldom happened, and never without some powerful  cause. His brow was much wrinkled, but as it seemed to be so from deep  thinking it gave still greater expression to his face. Though of a  form which appeared delicate and feeble, no one could endure greater  fatigue. This may be attributed to his active and temperate habits,  and to the wonderful energy of his mind. He was most certainly able to  use more exertion and undergo more hardship and toil than most people  of a robust frame. The spirit \"which burned within him\" was indeed  equal to any effort. The only weak point in his character was the  horror which he had of being reminded in any way of his age as he  advanced in life: he most carefully avoided everything which could  make him think of it. All the looking-glasses in his house were  either removed or so completely covered that he could not catch even  a transient glimpse of his face or person. He often joked about his  personal appearance, but said that he had all his life avoided looking  at himself in the glass, solely that he might not perceive the change  which years bring, and which might perhaps make him suppose himself  growing too old for military pursuits. Be this as it may, he never  would look near a mirror. If he happened to go into a room where there  was one, the very moment he perceived it he shut his eyes, made all  manner of odd faces, and ran by it at his utmost speed out of the  room. When a chair chanced to be in his way he jumped over it, to show  that he retained his activity; and for the same reason he always ran  in and out of the room. It was but seldom that he was seen to move at  a slower pace. When in the company of strangers he even quickened the  speed of his motions, and exhibited the most droll antics to impress  upon their minds that he was still equal to take the field. It was the  custom to rise early--never later at any time of the year than four  o'clock, and often even at midnight--to the end of his life. As soon  as he rose he was well drenched with cold water, even in the depth of  the most severe winter. He generally dined in winter at eight o'clock  in the morning, and in summer at seven. Dinner was his principal meal.  Though his cookery could not have been very tempting, as it was made  up of ill-dressed Cossack ragouts, nobody ventured to find any fault  with it, and his good appetite made it palatable to himself. He never  sat down to a meal without a thanksgiving or an invocation for a  blessing. If any among his guests did not take part in the grace by  responding \"Amen,\" he would say, \"Those who have not said amen shall  have no _eau de vie_.\" He never took any refreshment through the rest  of the day, but a few cups of tea or coffee. He never exceeded at  table, but was fond of sitting long after dinner. This habit he wished  to correct, and gave his aid-de-camp, Tichinka, directions to order  him from table whenever he thought he was remaining too long; and  this was to be managed after the fashion which he prescribed. When the  injunction was obeyed, he would ask, \"By whose order?\" When Tichinka  made reply, \"By Marshal Suwarrow's order,\" he immediately rose  from table, and said, with a smile, \"Very well: the marshal must  be obeyed.\" According to his desire the same ceremony was gone  through when he was too sedentary, and as soon as he was told by  his aid-de-camp that Marshal Suwarrow had ordered him to go out he  instantly complied. As he was unlike every one, so he dressed like  nobody else. He wore whole boots so wide that they fell about his  heels. His waistcoat and breeches were of white dimity; the lining  and collar of the waistcoat were of green cloth; his little helmet of  felt was ornamented with green fringe. This was his military dress  throughout the whole year, except when the weather was intensely cold,  and then he substituted white cloth for the dimity. His appearance was  still more strange from his frequently leaving the garter and stocking  hanging loose upon one leg, while the other was booted; but as the  boot was thus occasionally discarded in consequence of a wound in  the leg, it was nothing to laugh at. His long sabre trailed along  the ground, and his thin dress hung loosely about his slight person.  Equipped in this extraordinary manner it was that Suwarrow reviewed,  harangued, and commanded his soldiers. On great occasions he appeared  in his superb dress as field-marshal, and wore the profusion of  splendid ornaments which had been bestowed on the occasion of his  victories. Among them was the magnificent golden-hilted sword, studded  with jewels, and the gorgeous plume of diamonds which he had received  from the hand of the Empress, among other marks of distinction, for  his extraordinary services at Aczakoff. At other times he wore no  ornament but the chain of the order of St. Andrew. He carried no watch  or ornaments with him, save those which commemorated his military  exploits. On these he delighted to look, as they were associated in  his mind with the most gratifying events of his life--his glory,  and the favor of his sovereign. He would sometimes show them to a  stranger, exhibiting them one by one, and setting his stamp of value  on each, as he would say, \"At such an action I gained this order--at  such another, this;\" and so on till he had told the remarkable  occurrence to which he owed the possession of each--a pride that  was natural in one who had earned them so bravely. His whole style  of living was marked by the greatest simplicity. He preferred the  plainest apartment, without any article of luxury: he scarcely ever  slept in a house when his troops were encamped; and he not only stayed  in his tent at night, but for the most part of the day, only entering  the house appropriated to his staff at dinner-time. Throughout his  whole military career he had never passed an entire night in bed. He  stretched himself, when he lay down to rest, on a bundle of hay; nor  would he indulge himself in a more luxurious couch, even in the palace  of the Empress. He had no carriage, but a plain kibitk, (a sort of  chariot,) drawn by hired horses, for he kept no horses; but when he  required one, as on the occasion of a review or some other military  operation, he mounted any which chanced to be at hand. Sometimes  it belonged to one of the Cossacks, but oftener was lent to him by  his aid-de-camp, Tichinka. He was without servants, keeping but one  attendant to wait upon himself, and employing some of the soldiers  in the service of his house. This mode of living arose not from  parsimony, but from an utter indifference to any kind of indulgence,  which he considered beneath a soldier's attention. He had a contempt  for money as a means of procuring gratification, but valued it as  often affording him the pleasure of being generous and kind. He gave  up his entire share of the immense booty at Ismail, and divided it  among his soldiers. He never carried any money about him, or asked  the price of anything, but left all to the management of Tichinka. His  strictness in doing what he considered just, when he conceived himself  in the slightest degree accountable, was very remarkable. On one  occasion an officer had lost at play sixty rubles, with which he had  supplied himself from the military chest. Suwarrow reprimanded the  officer severely, but refunded the sum from his own resources. \"It  is right,\" said he, in a letter to the Empress, in which he alluded  to the circumstance, \"it is right that I should make it good, for  I am answerable for the officers I employ.\" One of Suwarrow's odd  peculiarities consisted in keeping up the appearance of a soldier  at all times. When he saluted any person, he drew up, turned out his  toes, threw back his shoulders, kept himself quite erect, and turned  the back of his hand to his helmet, as soldiers do when saluting their  officers. He was greatly attached to Tichinka, an old soldier, who had  once saved his life. From that time he never separated from him: he  made him his aid-de-camp, and gave him the sole management of all his  affairs.    Suwarrow was very remarkable for his directness; and so great was  his aversion to an evasive or unmeaning expression, that he never  could bear the person who made use of such, and was sure to give him  the name of _Niesnion_, which may be translated, \"I don't know,\"  \"possibly,\" or \"perhaps.\" He would take no such answer; but would  say, in an emphatic tone, \"try,\" \"learn,\" or \"set about it.\" Indeed,  the abhorrence in which he held any mode of expression which was not  dictated by the most perfect frankness was so great, that he could not  endure the flattery and unmeaning civility of courtiers; and he never  hesitated to mark his displeasure by bitter satire, regardless of the  presence of those against whom it was directed, even if the Empress  herself made one of the company. This caused him to be feared and  disliked by many at court. His acquirements were considerable. He  spoke eight languages--French, like a native. He composed verses  with facility; he had read much, and was particularly well-informed  in history and biography. Notwithstanding his remarkable frankness  and all his oddities, his manners were engaging and polished: his  conversation was original, energetic, and lively; he would often  indulge in sallies of pleasantry to amuse the Empress, and as he was  an excellent mimic, he would take off the uncouth manners and accents  of some of the soldiers to the life. He had a dislike to writing,  always asserting that a pen was an unfit implement for a soldier."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 1 (#16)"],[1,"lover.    So it happened in this case. While her sisters were thinking how good  it was of Field to take so much interest in a mere child, their long  afternoon drives together down \"Lovers' Lane, Saint Jo,\" had come to  that happy turn that ignores all immaturities of age and lays the life  of a man at the feet of the maid--albeit, the feet are still strangers  to the French heels and have not yet known the witchery that goes with  long dresses. Once sure of himself, Field lost no time in making his  wishes known not only to Mistress Julia, but to her astonished family.  She listened and was lost and won. Her parents expostulated that she  was but a child. Field had no difficulty in convincing them that she  would outgrow that. He pleaded for an immediate marriage, but her  father firmly insisted that though Julia might not be too young to  love and be loved, she was \"o'er young to marry yet.\" Field was forced  to accept the sensible decree against the early realization of his  hopes and returned to St. Louis with the understanding that he should  establish himself in business and wait until Miss Comstock was  eighteen.    Whether this had anything to do with Field's going to Europe or not I  cannot say. It had nothing to do with his return, for his term of  waiting for his modern Rachel had still two years to run when he got  back from Europe. There is a pretty story told that after all  arrangements were made for his European trip and he and Edgar  Comstock, accompanied by Miss Ida, had reached New York, she and her  brother were amazed to receive a note by mail saying, \"Important  business has called me back to St. Joseph; I hope you will pardon my  sudden leave-taking.\" They knew the nature of his important business  and had to wait with what patience they could command while he posted  fifteen hundred miles and returned with barely time, if all  connections served, to catch the steamer.    Field never dreamed of fulfilling that condition of his probation  which required him to become established in business. If he had done  so the date of his marriage would have been indefinitely postponed. He  returned from Europe, as we have seen, sans the better part of his  patrimony, in the spring of 1873, and instead of attempting to  establish himself in business, immediately set himself to secure an  abridgment of his term of waiting. The years between fourteen and  eighteen run slow. To every true lover Time moves with leaden feet. As  Rosalind tells us, \"Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the  contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized: if the interim  be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of  seven year.\" What wonder then if the four years they were pledged to  wait seemed an eternity, and that both set themselves to abridge it by  all the arts and persuasion of young lovers. They pleaded and  contrived so cunningly and successfully that the obdurate parents  finally acceded to their wishes, and Eugene Field and Julia Sutherland  Comstock were married at St. Joseph on October 16th, 1873. The bride  \"at that time was a girl of sixteen,\" is the laconic and only comment  of the \"Auto-Analysis.\" This he supplemented with the further  information, \"we have had eight children--three daughters and five  sons.\"    [Illustration: MRS. EUGENE FIELD.]    But this is jumping from Saint Jo into the future more than a score of  years in advance of our story. The young couple spent their honeymoon  in the East. Field took especial delight in showing his bride of  sixteen the wonders of New York and in playing practical jokes upon  her unsophisticated nature, thereby keeping her in a perpetual state  of amazement or of terror as to what he would do next. He sought to  make her at home at Delmonico's by ordering \"boiled pig's feet a la  Saint Jo,\" with a gravity of countenance that tested the solemnity of  the waiters and provoked the protest, \"Oh, Eugene!\" that was to be the  feminine accompaniment to his boyish humor throughout their married  life. No matter how often Field played his antics before or on his  wife, they always seemed to take her by surprise and evoked a  remonstrance in which pride over his mirthfulness mollified all  displeasure.    By the time Field returned to St. Louis his ready funds were exhausted  and he had to appeal to Mr. Gray to raise more by mortgaging the  balance of his interest in his father's property. This is as good a  place as any to take leave of the patrimony that came to Field at the  death of his father, for he was never to see any more dividends from  that source. When the loans fell due there were no funds to pay them,  nor equity in the land to justify their renewal. So the land was sold  and bid in by Mr. Gray, who holds it yet and would gladly dispose of  it for what he paid out of his pocket and the goodness of his heart.    Roswell Field tells an interesting story of how their father's land  speculation went out of sight in the queer mutations that befall real  estate. In the year before Roswell the elder died, he took his younger  son for a drive in the country south of St. Louis, where the property  lies unimproved to this day. \"Rosy,\" said the father, \"hold on to your  Carondelet property. In fifteen years it will be worth half a million  dollars, and, very likely, a million and a half.\" That was  thirty-three years ago when the Carondelet iron furnaces were in full  blast and the city seemed stretching southward. In 1869 the property  was appraised at $125,000. The panic came on and St. Louis changed its  mind and headed toward the west, where the best part of the city now  rears its mansions and wonders how it ever dreamed of going south.  There Carondelet still bakes in the sun, on the far side of a slough  which has diverted a fortune from the sons of the sanguine Roswell M.  Field, the elder.    More provident than his brother, Roswell lived comfortably on his  share for nearly seven years, only in the end to envy the superior  shrewdness of Eugene, who, putting his portion into cash, realized  more from it, and spent it like a lord while it lasted. I must confess  that I share Roswell's views, for the investment which Eugene Field  made in the two years after coming of age in spending $20,000 on  experience, returned to him many fold in the profession he was finally  driven to adopt, not as a pastime, but to earn a livelihood for  himself and his growing family.    Having shot his bolt, Field went to work as a reporter on the St.  Louis Evening Journal. He was not much of a success as a reporter for  the simple reason that his fancy was more active than his legs and he  was irresistibly disposed to save the latter at the expense of the  former.    The best pen picture I have been able to secure of Field at this  period of his career is from his life-long friend, William C. Buskett,  the hero of \"Penn Yan Bill,\" to whom Field dedicated \"Casey's Table  d'Hote,\" the first poem in \"A Little Book of Western Verse.\"    \"My association with Eugene Field,\" says Mr. Buskett, \"began in St.  Louis, Mo., in 1872. We had a little circle of friends that was surely  to be envied in that we were fond of each other and our enjoyment was  pure and genuine. In 1875 we formed what was known as the 'Arion  Quartette,' composed of Thomas L. Crawford, now clerk in the United  States Circuit Court in St. Louis, Thomas C. Baker (deceased), Roswell  Martin Field, a brother of Eugene, and myself. 'Gene (as he was always  called by his intimates) did not sing in the quartette, though he had  a good voice. We frequently gave entertainments, at which Eugene was  always the centre of attraction. The 'Old Sexton' was his favorite  song. He was a great mimic and tease, and was always bubbling over  with fun. At that time he was living on Adams Street, and many of  these entertainments were given at his house. His household then  consisted of himself, wife, and baby 'Trotty,' the pet name given his  eldest daughter, Mary French Field, and with them Mrs. Comstock,  mother of Mrs. Field, Edgar V. and Misses Carrie, Georgia, and Gussie  Comstock, a delightful family.    \"There was a genuine bond of friendship among us all then, for we were  comparatively oblivious to care and trouble. We were all poor, you may  say, earning reasonable salaries, but that never seemed to worry us  much. If one had a dollar we would always divide and the crowd was  never a cent ahead, but we defied misfortune.    \"Among the pranks that Eugene used to play upon his wife in those days  was that of appearing at some of our rehearsals on a warm evening in a  costume that never failed to tease her. He would walk into the parlor  and say: 'Well, boys, let us take off our coats and take it easy; it's  too hot.' We would all proceed to do so. When Eugene would remove his  coat he would display a red flannel undershirt, having pinned his  cuffs to his coat sleeves and his necktie and collar to his shirt. He  placed no limit on his humor.\"    Who of those at all intimate with Field will forget the enjoyment he  took in trolling forth, in a quaint, quavering, cracked, but tuneful  recitative, one stanza of \"Ossian's Serenade\":      _I'll chase the antelope over the plain    The tiger's cub I'll bind with a chain,    The wild gazelle with its silvery feet    I'll give to thee as a playmate sweet.    Then come with me in my light canoe,    While the sea is calm and the sky is blue,    For I'll not linger another day    For storms may rise and love decay._    Well, this was a snatch that lingered in his memory from the old days  in Adams Street, St. Louis, where he first caught it from the lips of  Mr. Buskett, in whose family it was an heirloom. Field finally traced  it to its source through persistent letters written to himself in his  \"Sharps and Flats\" column in the Chicago Record.    The glad wild days of which Mr. Buskett testifies were passed in St.  Louis after Field's"]]]
