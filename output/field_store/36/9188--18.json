[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16224"],[0,"A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#16)"],[1,"seemed to be rushing down  in one immense torrent. The tops of the Cathedral and of the abbey of St.  Ouen were almost veiled in darkness, by the passing storm; but the lower  part of the tower, and the whole of the nave of each building, were in one  stream of golden light--from the last powerful rays of the setting sun. In  ten minutes this magically-varied scene settled into the sober, uniform  tint of evening; but I can never forget the rich bed of purple and pink,  fringed with burnished gold, in which the sun of that evening set! I  descended--absorbed in the recollection of the lovely objects which I had  just contemplated--and regaled by the sounds of a thousand little gurgling  streamlets, created by the passing tempest, and hastening to precipitate  themselves into the Seine.    Of the different trades, especially retail, which are carried on in Rouen  with the greatest success, those connected with the _cotton manufactories_  cannot fail to claim your attention; and I fancied I saw, in some of the  shop-windows, shawls and gowns which might presume to vie with our  Manchester and Norwich productions. Nevertheless, I learnt that the French  were extremely partial to British manufactures: and cotton stockings,  coloured muslins, and what are called ginghams, are coveted by them with  the same fondness as we prize their cambric and their lace. Their best  articles in watches, clocks, silver ornaments, and trinkets, are obtained  from Paris. But in respect to upholstery, I must do the Rouennois the  justice to say, that I never saw any thing to compare with their  _escrutoires_ and other articles of furniture made of the walnut tree.  These upright escrutoires, or writing desks, are in almost every bed-room  of the more respectable hotels: but of course their polish is gone when  they become stationary furniture in an inn--for the art of rubbing, or what  is called _elbow-grease_ with us--is almost unknown on either side of the  Seine. You would be charmed to have a fine specimen of a side board, or an  escrutoire, (the latter five or six feet high) made by one of their best  cabinet-makers from choice walnut wood. The polish and tone of colour are  equally gratifying; and resemble somewhat that of rose wood, but of a gayer  aspect. The _or-molu_ ornaments are tastefully put on; but the general  shape, or contour, of the several pieces of furniture, struck me as being  in bad taste.    He who wishes to be astonished by the singularity of a scene, connected  with _trade_, should walk leisurely down the RUE DE ROBEC. It is surely the  oddest, and as some may think, the most repulsive scene imaginable: But who  that has a rational curiosity could resist such a walk? Here live the  _dyers of clothes_--and in the middle of the street rushes the precipitous  stream, called _L'Eau de Robec_[67]--receiving colours of all hues. To-day  it is nearly jet black: to-morrow it is bright scarlet: a third day it is  blue, and a fourth day it is yellow! Meanwhile it is partially concealed by  little bridges, communicating with the manufactories, or with that side of  the street where the work-people live: and the whole has a dismal and  disagreeable aspect--especially in dirty weather: but if you go to one end  of it (I think to the east--as it runs east and west) and look down upon  the descending street, with the overhanging upper stories and roofs--the  foreshortened, numerous bridges--the differently-coloured dyed clothes,  suspended from the windows, or from poles--the constant motion of men,  women, and children, running across the bridges--with the rapid, _camelion_  stream beneath--you cannot fail to acknowledge that this is one of the most  singular, grotesque, and uncommon sights in the wonder-working city of  Rouen. I ought to tell you that the first famous Cardinal d'Amboise (of  whom the preceding pages have made such frequent honourable mention) caused  the _Eau de Robec_ to be directed through the streets of Rouen, from its  original channel or source in a little valley near _St. Martin du Vivien_.  Formerly there was a much more numerous clan of these \"teinturiers\" in the  Rue de Robec--but they have of late sought more capacious premises in the  fauxbourgs _de St. Hilaire_ and _de Martainville_. The neighbouring  sister-stream, _l'Eau d'Aubette_, is destined to the same purposes as that  of which I have been just discoursing; but I do not at this moment  recollect whether it be also dignified, in its course, by turning a few  corn mills, ere it empties itself into the Seine. Indeed the thundering  noise of one of these mills, turned by the Robec river, near the church of  St. Maclou, will not be easily forgotten. Thus you see of what various,  strange, and striking objects the city of Rouen is composed. Bustle, noise,  life and activity, in the midst of an atmosphere unsullied by the fumes of  sea coal:--hilarity and apparent contentment:--the spruce bourgeoise and  the slattern fille de chambre:--attired in vestments of deep crimson and  dark blue--every thing flits before you as if touched by magic, and as if  sorrow and misfortune were unknown to the inhabitants.    \"Paullo majora canamus.\" In other words, let us leave the Town for the  Country. Let us hurry through a few more narrow and crowded alleys, courts,  and streets--and as the morning is yet beautiful, let us hasten onwards to  enjoy the famous Panorama of Rouen and its environs from the MONT STE.  CATHARINE.... Indeed, my friend, I sincerely wish that you could have  accompanied me to the summit of this enchanting eminence: but as you are  far away, you must be content with a brief description of our little  expedition thither.[68] The Mont Ste. Catharine, which is entirely chalk,  is considered the highest of the hills in the immediate vicinity of Rouen;  or rather, perhaps, is considered the point of elevation from which the  city is to be viewed to the greatest possible advantage. It lies to the  left of the Seine, in your way from the town; and the ascent begins  considerably beyond the barriers. Indeed it is on the route to Paris. We  took an excellent _fiacre_ to carry us to the beginning of the ascent, that  our legs might be in proper order for scrambling up the acclivities  immediately above; and leaving the main road to the right, we soon  commenced our ambulatory operations in good earnest. But there was not much  labour or much difficulty: so, halting, or standing, or sitting, on each  little eminence, our admiration seemed to encrease--till, gaining the  highest point, looking towards the west, we found ourselves immediately  above the town and the whole of its environs....        \"Heavens, what a goodly prospect spread around!\"    The prospect was indeed \"goodly--\" being varied, extensive, fertile, and  luxuriant ... in spite of a comparatively backward spring. The city was the  main object, not only of attraction, but of astonishment. Although the  point from which we viewed it is considered to be exactly on a level with  the summit of the spire of the Cathedral, yet we seemed to be hanging, as  it were, in the air, immediately over the streets themselves. We saw each  church, each public edifice, and almost each street; nay, we began to think  we could discover almost every individual stirring in them. The soldiers,  exercising on the parade in the Champ de Mars, seemed to be scarcely two  stones' throw from us; while the sounds of their music reached us in the  most distinct and gratifying manner. No \"Diable boiteux\" could ever have  transported a \"Don Cleophas Leandro Perez Zambullo\" to a more favourable  situation for a knowledge of what was passing in a city; and if the houses  had been unroofed, we could have almost discerned whether the _escrutoires_  were made of mahogany or walnut-wood! This wonder-working effect proceeds  from the extraordinary clearness of the atmosphere, and the absence of  sea-coal fume. The sky was perfectly blue--the generality of the roofs were  also composed of blue slate: this, added to the incipient verdure of the  boulevards, and the darker hues of the trunks of the trees, upon the  surrounding hills--the lengthening forests to the left, and the numerous  white \"maisons de plaisance\"[69] to the right--while the Seine, with its  hundred vessels, immediately below, to the left, and in face of you--with  its cultivated little islands--and the sweeping meadows or race-ground[70]  on the other side--all, or indeed any, of these objects could not fail to  excite our warmest admiration, and to make us instinctively exclaim \"that  such a panorama was perfectly unrivalled!\"    We descended Mont Ste. Catharine on the side facing the _Hospice General_:  a building of a very handsome form, and considerable dimensions. It is a  noble establishment for foundlings, and the aged and infirm of both sexes.  I was told that not fewer than twenty-five hundred human beings were  sheltered in this asylum; a number, which equally astonished and delighted  me. The descent, on this side the hill, is exceedingly pleasing; being  composed of serpentine little walks, through occasional alleys of trees and  shrubs, to the very base of the hill, not many hundred yards from the  hospital. The architecture of this extensive building is more mixed than  that of its neighbour the _Hospice d'Humanite_, on account of the different  times in which portions of it were added: but, upon the whole, you are  rather struck with its approach to what may be called magnificence of  style. I was indeed pleased with the good order and even good breeding of  its motley inhabitants. Some were strolling quietly, with their arms behind  them, between rows of trees:--others were tranquilly sitting upon benches:  a third group would be in motion within the squares of the building: a  fourth appeared in deep consultation whether the _potage_ of to day were  not inferior to that of the preceding day?--\"Que cherchez vous, Monsieur?\"  said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],[0,"Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#16)"],[1," and busy all day, and perhaps nobody has ever tried to  show them how wrong it is; but I really believe some of them could be  influenced, if once they would seriously think of the wrong they are  doing.  That is the reason, Kathy, I suggested to get a lot of them  together to talk about saving the birds.\"    The gentle cripple had never even heard of the great Audubon.  She did  not know that societies existed in many States called by the name of  the distinguished naturalist, engaged in the same merciful work.    Miss Katharine drew from the satchel the paper clipping and handed it  to her sister, saying: \"This is a coincidence surely; I cut this out of  the daily paper at the store some time ago, intending to give it to  you, but I always forgot it.  It is an account of the proceedings of a  convention in one of the big cities.  You will see by reading it that  somebody else has been thinking your identical thoughts.\"    \"How lovely that is!\" exclaimed Eliza when she had carefully read the  notice.  \"How I should have enjoyed being at that meeting.  We will  help those people all we can, Kathy, by stirring up our acquaintances  here.  You invite the girls for tomorrow night and I'll have the house  ready for them.\"    That I had been an inspiration to this gentle girl in her work of mercy  was a great joy to me, and all the next day I was constantly bursting  into a round of cheerful twitters and I swung myself in my hoop as fast  as I could make it go.    The best room was swept and dusted with the greatest care, and a few  extra chairs moved in from other parts of the house.  My cage was  transferred from its usual hook to the parlor, and about eight o'clock  the guests thronged in and soon every seat was filled.  They were  principally girls who were clerks in stores, or worked in shops and  offices, and many of them were very smartly dressed.  A few, like Miss  Katharine and her sister, were more plainly attired; but all were  lively and full of girlish fun and seemed to enjoy being together.  My  cage hung in view of every one, and I was proud to be selected as an  object-lesson by the lame hostess in her introductory appeal to her  guests to help save the birds.  She so presented the facts that before  the evening was over she had roused an enthusiasm in some of them  almost equal to her own, and several pledges were given not to wear  birds again.    \"There is something new in the way of womanly cruelty which isn't so  well known as the destruction of the birds,\" remarked one of the  company.  \"The humane society ought to get after the women who wear  baby lamb trimming.\"    \"The way sealskins are procured is also very cruel,\" said another girl.    \"I have never read much about it,\" answered Eliza, \"but it surely  cannot be so wicked as killing song birds, because the sealskin is an  article of clothing which serves to keep the body warm, while a dead  bird sewed on your hat is merely for show and doesn't keep you warm or  cool or anything else.\"    \"It is not the use that is made of the sealskin that is wrong, but the  cruelty of the hunters in getting it,\" replied the young lady who had  first spoken.  \"They say when the parent seal is captured the young one  cries for it exactly as a human baby cries after its mother.  It is  most pitiful to hear it wail.  The branding of the poor creatures is a  most brutal thing.\"    \"Why are they branded?\" asked Kathy.    \"Well, you know, for some years there has been a great strife between  the United States and Canada, principally over the seal fisheries.  Each was afraid the other would get more than its share.  To put a stop  to the seals being entirely killed off, as was likely to be the case  since so many poachers were in the business, one of our government  agents suggested that the seals should be branded.  They drive them  into pens and burn them with red-hot irons.\"    \"It isn't likely that any of us will be called upon to deny ourselves  the wearing of baby lamb, as it is quite expensive, but we can condemn  it by word if not by example,\" observed Kathy.    The good-nights were said and the company dispersed, not so jolly and  noisy as they came, but with thoughtfulness arising from awakened  consciences.  The humble lame girl had sowed the good seed.    Polly was to come back from her grandmother's the next week and, though  I looked forward with pleasure to being with her again, I felt sorry to  leave this peaceful home.  The worthy lives and beautiful aims of these  obscure girls of whom the world knew nothing was a sweet remembrance to  carry with me.    \"Thank Polly for me for Dickey Downy's visit and tell her whenever she  wants to go away anywhere I'll be glad to take care of him for her,\"  Eliza said when the time came for me to go.    She gave the cage into Miss Kathy's hand.  I chirped a farewell to her  and she whistled back to me and we parted to see each other no more.          CHAPTER XIV    THE COUNTRY SCHOOL      Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.            --_Bible._      Polly's welcome to me was most cordial.  She was bright as a cricket  and full of chat about her visit.  With her usual care she examined my  cage closely to see that everything was in order and petted and praised  me for a little while to my full content, then ran to Miss Kathy to  tell her of the new story book which had been presented to her while  away.    \"And I am going to read you the stories some day,\" she added.    Her young playmates flocked in to see her and as I listened to their  glad voices my heart yearned more than ever for my comrades of the  woods, for a thought of spring was in the air.    As the days went by there were indeed signs all around that spring was  on the way.  The wind no longer bellowed hoarsely in the treetops, but  had a mellow, musical sound and the raindrops that struck the window  pane trickled softly as if glad to come out of the clouds.    Just after school one bright afternoon Polly came to the door on the  side porch and called in to Miss Katharine:    \"I'll be playing out in the yard awhile.  Louise and Nancy have come to  stay till half-past five o'clock, so if mother needs me you'll know  where to find me.\"    \"All right\" said Miss Kathy.  \"Go on and have a jolly time.\"    And a jolly time they had, judging from the merry shouts that came in  through the open door.    \"I've got your tag!  I've got your tag!\" I could hear Polly say, and  then there was a great scampering of feet and roars of laughter as they  chased each other up and down the walks.  This was kept up for some  minutes, then a voice began:      \"Intery-mintery, cutery-corn,    Apple-seed and briar-thorn,    Wire, briar, limber-lock,    Three geese in one flock;    One flew east and one flew west    And one flew over the cuckoo's nest.\"    \"Oh, Louise, you're out!  It's your turn first.\"    \"I wonder if we are the geese?\" said Nancy.  Then they all giggled as  if what she had said was very funny.    \"Louise, Louise, look, look!  You're going to have good luck,\"  presently shouted two voices.  \"A ladybird has lighted on your  shoulder.\"    \"Oh, goody!\" said Louise.  \"I wonder what my good luck is going to be?\"    \"Shake it off, Louise, let it light on me,\" said Nancy.  \"I want good  luck to come to me too.\"    \"It is just the color of my new crimson dress,\" declared Polly.    \"Only your red dress hasn't spots on it,\" corrected Louise.    \"No, but the red is about the same shade as my dress.  Oh, girls,  wouldn't a row of ladybirds for buttons be pretty on my waist?\"    At this quaint conceit the three girls all giggled again.    \"I do think they are the cutest little bugs.  I never get tired of  looking at them,\" observed Polly.    \"Bugs?  You wouldn't call them bugs, would you?\" inquired Louise.  \"I  think they are little beetles.\"    \"Beetles?  No, no,\" said Polly and Nancy both in one breath,  \"A beetle  is a big black thing that flies around only at dusk.\"    \"Do you suppose your father would know?\" asked Louise of Polly.  \"Let's  take it in the house and ask him, and so settle whether it is bug or  beetle.\"    And they came running into the sitting room behind the store to show  the lady-bird to Polly's father, who was there looking over his paper.    \"Is it a bug or a beetle?\" they asked.    He laid down the paper and looked at the pretty little insect a moment.    \"It is a ladybird.\"    \"Yes, of course, we know that, papa; but Nancy and I say it is a bug,  and Louise says it's a beetle,\" explained Polly.    \"Louise is right,\" was his reply.  \"It is classed as a beetle.  It is  one of the best friends the farmer has, and the fruit grower too.\"    \"How is it useful to him?\" asked Nancy.    \"Why, it eats the lice that spoil certain plants and leaves and grain.  I notice that the Australian government is--Do you girls know where  Australia is?\" he asked, interrupting himself.    \"Of course we do,\" they all shouted with much laughing, as if it were a  great joke to ask them such a question.    \"Well, I was going to tell you that the Australian government is taking  steps to encourage the ladybird on purpose to help the fruit farmers of  that country.  Perhaps they have heard that it brings good luck,\" he  added with a smile.    \"Let's show it to Dickey Downy and then put it out of the door and let  it go home,\" said Polly.    \"Dickey Downy wouldn't know a lady-bird from a grasshopper,\" answered  Nancy teasingly.    Polly retorted, \"Don't be too sure!  Dickey is a very intelligent bird,  a very extraordinary bird.\"    She contented herself with paying me compliments, for instead of  bringing the crimson beetle into the store she opened the window and  let him fly away.    \"Well, I'm glad I have learned something new about ladybirds,\" remarked  Louise, as she tied her hat strings ready to go home.    \"And I too,\" chimed in Nancy.  \"I am glad the Australians prize the  pretty little creatures.  It's nice to be useful and handsome too.\" "]]]
