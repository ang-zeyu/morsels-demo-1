Weymouth shrugged his shoulders.    \"Not one that includes the green mist,\" he said.  \"Shall we go in now?\"    We crossed the Assyrian hall, where the members of that strange  household were gathered in a panic-stricken group.  They numbered four.  Two of them were negroes, and two Easterns of some kind.  I missed the  Chinaman, Kwee, of whom Smith had spoken, and the Italian secretary;  and from the way in which my friend peered about the shadows of the  hall I divined that he, too, wondered at their absence.  We entered Sir  Lionel's study--an apartment which I despair of describing.    Nayland Smith's words, \"an earthquake at Sotheby's auction-rooms,\"  leaped to my mind at once; for the place was simply stacked with  curious litter--loot of Africa, Mexico and Persia.  In a clearing by  the hearth a gas stove stood upon a packing-case, and about it lay a  number of utensils for camp cookery.  The odor of rotting vegetation,  mingled with the insistent perfume of the strange night-blooming  flowers, was borne in through the open window.    In the center of the floor, beside an overturned sarcophagus, lay a  figure in a neutral-colored dressing-gown, face downwards, and arms  thrust forward and over the side of the ancient Egyptian mummy case.    My friend advanced and knelt beside the dead man.    \"Good God!\"    Smith sprang upright and turned with an extraordinary expression to  Inspector Weymouth.    \"You do not know Sir Lionel Barton by sight?\" he rapped.    \"No,\" began Weymouth, \"but--\"    \"This is not Sir Lionel.  This is Strozza, the secretary.\"    \"What!\" shouted Weymouth.    \"Where is the other--the Chinaman--quick!\" cried Smith.    \"I have had him left where he was found--on the conservatory steps,\"  said the Inspector.    Smith ran across the room to where, beyond the open door, a glimpse  might be obtained of stacked-up curiosities.  Holding back the curtain  to allow more light to penetrate, he bent forward over a crumpled-up  figure which lay upon the steps below.    \"It is!\" he cried aloud.  \"It is Sir Lionel's servant, Kwee.\"    Weymouth and I looked at one another across the body of the Italian;  then our eyes turned together to where my friend, grim-faced, stood  over the dead Chinaman.  A breeze whispered through the leaves; a great  wave of exotic perfume swept from the open window towards the curtained  doorway.    It was a breath of the East--that stretched out a yellow hand to the  West.  It was symbolic of the subtle, intangible power manifested in  Dr. Fu-Manchu, as Nayland Smith--lean, agile, bronzed with the suns of  Burma, was symbolic of the clean British efficiency which sought to  combat the insidious enemy.    \"One thing is evident,\" said Smith:  \"no one in the house, Strozza  excepted, knew that Sir Lionel was absent.\"    \"How do you arrive at that?\" asked Weymouth.    \"The servants, in the hall, are bewailing him as dead.  If they had  seen him go out they would know that it must be someone else who lies  here.\"    \"What about the Chinaman?\"    \"Since there is no other means of entrance to the conservatory save  through the study, Kwee must have hidden himself there at some time  when his master was absent from the room.\"    \"Croxted found the communicating door closed.  What killed the  Chinaman?\"    \"Both Miss Edmonds and Croxted found the study door locked from the  inside.  What killed Strozza?\" retorted Smith.    \"You will have noted,\" continued the Inspector, \"that the secretary is  wearing Sir Lionel's dressing-gown. It was seeing him in that, as she  looked in at the window, which led Miss Edmonds to mistake him for her  employer--and consequently to put us on the wrong scent.\"    \"He wore it in order that anybody looking in at the window would be  sure to make that mistake,\" rapped Smith.    \"Why?\" I asked.    \"Because he came here for a felonious purpose.  See.\"  Smith stooped  and took up several tools from the litter on the floor.  \"There lies  the lid.  He came to open the sarcophagus.  It contained the mummy of  some notable person who flourished under Meneptah II; and Sir Lionel  told me that a number of valuable ornaments and jewels probably were  secreted amongst the wrappings.  He proposed to open the thing and to  submit the entire contents to examination to-night. He evidently  changed his mind--fortunately for himself.\"    I ran my fingers through my hair in perplexity.    \"Then what has become of the mummy?\"    Nayland Smith laughed dryly.    \"It has vanished in the form of a green vapor apparently,\" he said.  \"Look at Strozza's face.\"    He turned the body over, and, used as I was to such spectacles, the  contorted features of the Italian filled me with horror, so--suggestive  were they of a death more than ordinarily violent.  I pulled aside the  dressing-gown and searched the body for marks, but failed to find any.  Nayland Smith crossed the room, and, assisted by the detective, carried  Kwee, the Chinaman, into the study and laid him fully in the light.  His puckered yellow face presented a sight even more awful than the  other, and his blue lips were drawn back, exposing both upper and lower  teeth.  There were no marks of violence, but his limbs, like Strozza's,  had been tortured during his mortal struggles into unnatural postures.    The breeze was growing higher, and pungent odor-waves from the damp  shrubbery, bearing, too, the oppressive sweetness of the creeping  plant, swept constantly through the open window.  Inspector Weymouth  carefully relighted his cigar.    \"I'm with you this far, Mr. Smith,\" he said.  \"Strozza, knowing Sir  Lionel to be absent, locked himself in here to rifle the mummy case,  for Croxted, entering by way of the window, found the key on the  inside.  Strozza didn't know that the Chinaman was hidden in the  conservatory--\"    \"And Kwee did not dare to show himself, because he too was there for  some mysterious reason of his own,\" interrupted Smith.    \"Having got the lid off, something,--somebody--\"    \"Suppose we say the mummy?\"    Weymouth laughed uneasily.    \"Well, sir, something that vanished from a locked room without opening  the door or the window killed Strozza.\"    \"And something which, having killed Strozza, next killed the Chinaman,  apparently without troubling to open the door behind which he lay  concealed,\" Smith continued.  \"For once in a way, Inspector, Dr.  Fu-Manchu has employed an ally which even his giant will was incapable  entirely to subjugate.  What blind force--what terrific agent of  death--had he confined in that sarcophagus!\"    \"You think this is the work of Fu-Manchu?\" I said.  \"If you are  correct, his power indeed is more than human.\"    Something in my voice, I suppose, brought Smith right about.  He  surveyed me curiously.    \"Can you doubt it?  The presence of a concealed Chinaman surely is  sufficient.  Kwee, I feel assured, was one of the murder group, though  probably he had only recently entered that mysterious service.  He is  unarmed, or I should feel disposed to think that his part was to  assassinate Sir Lionel whilst, unsuspecting the presence of a hidden  enemy, he was at work here.  Strozza's opening the sarcophagus clearly  spoiled the scheme.\"    \"And led to the death--\"    \"Of a servant of Fu-Manchu. Yes.  I am at a loss to account for that.\"    \"Do you think that the sarcophagus entered into the scheme, Smith?\"    My friend looked at me in evident perplexity.    \"You mean that its arrival at the time when a creature of the  Doctor--Kwee--was concealed here, may have been a coincidence?\"    I nodded; and Smith bent over the sarcophagus, curiously examining the  garish paintings with which it was decorated inside and out.  It lay  sideways upon the floor, and seizing it by its edge, he turned it over.    \"Heavy,\" he muttered; \"but Strozza must have capsized it as he fell.  He would not have laid it on its side to remove the lid.  Hallo!\"    He bent farther forward, catching at a piece of twine, and out of the  mummy case pulled a rubber stopper or \"cork.\"    \"This was stuck in a hole level with the floor of the thing,\" he said.  \"Ugh!  it has a disgusting smell.\"    I took it from his hands, and was about to examine it, when a loud  voice sounded outside in the hall.  The door was thrown open, and a big  man, who, despite the warmth of the weather, wore a fur-lined overcoat,  rushed impetuously into the room.    \"Sir Lionel!\" cried Smith eagerly.  \"I warned you!  And see, you have  had a very narrow escape.\"    Sir Lionel Barton glanced at what lay upon the floor, then from Smith  to myself, and from me to Inspector Weymouth.  He dropped into one of  the few chairs unstacked with books.    \"Mr. Smith,\" he said, with emotion, \"what does this mean?  Tell  me--quickly.\"    In brief terms Smith detailed the happenings of the night--or so much  as he knew of them.  Sir Lionel Barton listened, sitting quite still  the while--an unusual repose in a man of such evidently tremendous  nervous activity.    \"He came for the jewels,\" he said slowly, when Smith was finished; and  his eyes turned to the body of the dead Italian.  \"I was wrong to  submit him to the temptation.  God knows what Kwee was doing in hiding.  Perhaps he had come to murder me, as you surmise, Mr. Smith, though I  find it hard to believe.  But--I don't think this is the handiwork of  your Chinese doctor.\" He fixed his gaze upon the sarcophagus.    Smith stared at him in surprise.  \"What do you mean, Sir Lionel?\"    The famous traveler continued to look towards the sarcophagus with  something in his blue eyes that might have been dread.    \"I received a wire from Professor Rembold to-night,\" he continued.  \"You were correct in supposing that no one but Strozza knew of my  absence.  I dressed hurriedly and met the professor at the Traveler's.

And such a district exists in the heart of the second city  of England, the first manufacturing city of the world.  If any one wishes  to see in how little space a human being can move, how little air--and  _such_ air!--he can breathe, how little of civilisation he may share and  yet live, it is only necessary to travel hither.  True, this is the _Old_  Town, and the people of Manchester emphasise the fact whenever any one  mentions to them the frightful condition of this Hell upon Earth; but  what does that prove?  Everything which here arouses horror and  indignation is of recent origin, belongs to the _industrial epoch_.  The  couple of hundred houses, which belong to old Manchester, have been long  since abandoned by their original inhabitants; the industrial epoch alone  has crammed into them the swarms of workers whom they now shelter; the  industrial epoch alone has built up every spot between these old houses  to win a covering for the masses whom it has conjured hither from the  agricultural districts and from Ireland; the industrial epoch alone  enables the owners of these cattle-sheds to rent them for high prices to  human beings, to plunder the poverty of the workers, to undermine the  health of thousands, in order that they _alone_, the owners, may grow  rich.  In the industrial epoch alone has it become possible that the  worker scarcely freed from feudal servitude could be used as mere  material, a mere chattel; that he must let himself be crowded into a  dwelling too bad for every other, which he for his hard-earned wages buys  the right to let go utterly to ruin.  This manufacture has achieved,  which, without these workers, this poverty, this slavery could not have  lived.  True, the original construction of this quarter was bad, little  good could have been made out of it; but, have the landowners, has the  municipality done anything to improve it when rebuilding?  On the  contrary, wherever a nook or corner was free, a house has been run up;  where a superfluous passage remained, it has been built up; the value of  land rose with the blossoming out of manufacture, and the more it rose,  the more madly was the work of building up carried on, without reference  to the health or comfort of the inhabitants, with sole reference to the  highest possible profit on the principle that _no hole is so bad but that  some poor creature must take it who can pay for nothing better_.  However,  it is the Old Town, and with this reflection the bourgeoisie is  comforted.  Let us see, therefore, how much better it is in the New Town.    The New Town, known also as Irish Town, stretches up a hill of clay,  beyond the Old Town, between the Irk and St. George's Road.  Here all the  features of a city are lost.  Single rows of houses or groups of streets  stand, here and there, like little villages on the naked, not even grass-  grown clay soil; the houses, or rather cottages, are in bad order, never  repaired, filthy, with damp, unclean, cellar dwellings; the lanes are  neither paved nor supplied with sewers, but harbour numerous colonies of  swine penned in small sties or yards, or wandering unrestrained through  the neighbourhood.  The mud in the streets is so deep that there is never  a chance, except in the dryest weather, of walking without sinking into  it ankle deep at every step.  In the vicinity of St. George's Road, the  separate groups of buildings approach each other more closely, ending in  a continuation of lanes, blind alleys, back lanes and courts, which grow  more and more crowded and irregular the nearer they approach the heart of  the town.  True, they are here oftener paved or supplied with paved  sidewalks and gutters; but the filth, the bad order of the houses, and  especially of the cellars, remains the same.    It may not be out of place to make some general observations just here as  to the customary construction of working-men's quarters in Manchester.  We  have seen how in the Old Town pure accident determined the grouping of  the houses in general.  Every house is built without reference to any  other, and the scraps of space between them are called courts for want of  another name.  In the somewhat newer portions of the same quarter, and in  other working-men's quarters, dating from the early days of industrial  activity, a somewhat more orderly arrangement may be found.  The space  between two streets is divided into more regular, usually square courts.    These courts were built in this way from the beginning, and communicate  with the streets by means of covered passages.  If the totally planless  construction is injurious to the health of the workers by preventing  ventilation, this method of shutting them up in courts surrounded on all  sides by buildings is far more so.  The air simply cannot escape; the  chimneys of the houses are the sole drains for the imprisoned atmosphere  of the courts, and they serve the purpose only so long as fire is kept  burning. {55}  Moreover, the houses surrounding such courts are usually  built back to back, having the rear wall in common; and this alone  suffices to prevent any sufficient through ventilation.  And, as the  police charged with care of the streets, does not trouble itself about  the condition of these courts, as everything quietly lies where it is  thrown, there is no cause for wonder at the filth and heaps of ashes and  offal to be found here.  I have been in courts, in Millers Street, at  least half a foot below the level of the thoroughfares, and without the  slightest drainage for the water that accumulates in them in rainy  weather!  More recently another different method of building was adopted,  and has now become general.  Working-men's cottages are almost never  built singly, but always by the dozen or score; a single contractor  building up one or two streets at a time.  These are then arranged as  follows: One front is formed of cottages of the best class, so fortunate  as to possess a back door and small court, and these command the highest  rent.  In the rear of these cottages runs a narrow alley, the back  street, built up at both ends, into which either a narrow roadway or a  covered passage leads from one side.  The cottages which face this back  street command least rent, and are most neglected.  These have their rear  walls in common with the third row of cottages which face a second  street, and command less rent than the first row and more than the  second.    By this method of construction, comparatively good ventilation can be  obtained for the first row of cottages, and the third row is no worse off  than in the former method.  The middle row, on the other hand, is at  least as badly ventilated as the houses in the courts, and the back  street is always in the same filthy, disgusting condition as they.  The  contractors prefer this method because it saves them space, and furnishes  the means of fleecing better paid workers through the higher rents of the  cottages in the first and third rows.  These three different forms of  cottage building are found all over Manchester and throughout Lancashire  and Yorkshire, often mixed up together, but usually separate enough to  indicate the relative age of parts of towns.  The third system, that of  the back alleys, prevails largely in the great working-men's district  east of St. George's Road and Ancoats Street, and is the one most often  found in the other working-men's quarters of Manchester and its suburbs.    In the last-mentioned broad district included under the name Ancoats,  stand the largest mills of Manchester lining the canals, colossal six and  seven-storied buildings towering with their slender chimneys far above  the low cottages of the workers.  The population of the district  consists, therefore, chiefly of mill hands, and in the worst streets, of  hand-weavers.  The streets nearest the heart of the town are the oldest,  and consequently the worst; they are, however, paved, and supplied with  drains.  Among them I include those nearest to and parallel with Oldham  Road and Great Ancoats Street.  Farther to the north-east lie many newly-  built-up streets; here the cottages look neat and cleanly, doors and  windows are new and freshly painted, the rooms within newly whitewashed;  the streets themselves are better aired, the vacant building lots between  them larger and more numerous.  But this can be said of a minority of the  houses only, while cellar dwellings are to be found under almost every  cottage; many streets are unpaved and without sewers; and, worse than  all, this neat appearance is all pretence, a pretence which vanishes  within the first ten years.  For the construction of the cottages  individually is no less to be condemned than the plan of the streets.  All  such cottages look neat and substantial at first; their massive brick  walls deceive the eye, and, on passing through a _newly-built_ working-  men's street, without remembering the back alleys and the construction of  the houses themselves, one is inclined to agree with the assertion of the  Liberal manufacturers that the working population is nowhere so well  housed as in England.  But on closer examination, it becomes evident that  the walls of these cottages are as thin as it is possible to make them.  The outer walls, those of the cellar, which bear the weight of the ground  floor and roof, are one whole brick thick at most, the bricks lying with  their long sides touching; but I have seen many a cottage of the same  height, some in process of building, whose outer walls were but one-half  brick thick, the bricks lying not sidewise but lengthwise, their narrow  ends touching.  The object of this is to spare material, but there is  also another reason for it; namely, the fact that the contractors never  own the land but lease it, according to the English custom, for twenty,  thirty, forty, fifty, or ninety-nin"]]]
