Applied to a piece of furniture, a coffin, a house, a temple, decoration  possessed a certain magic property, of which the power and nature were  determined by each being or action represented, by each word inscribed or  spoken, at the moment of consecration. Every subject was, therefore, an  amulet as well as an ornament. So long as it endured, it ensured to the god  the continuance of homage rendered, or sacrifices offered, by the king. To  the king, whether living or dead, it confirmed the favours granted to him  by the god in recompense for his piety. It also preserved from destruction  the very wall upon which it was depicted. At the time of the Eighteenth  Dynasty, it was thought that two or three such amulets sufficed to compass  the desired effect; but at a later period it was believed that their number  could not be too freely multiplied, and the walls were covered with as many  as the surface would contain. An average chamber of Edfu or Denderah yields  more material for study than the hypostyle hall of Karnak; and the chapel  of Antoninus Pius at Philae, had it been finished, would have contained  more scenes than the sanctuary of Luxor and the passages by which it is  surrounded.    Observing the variety of subjects treated on the walls of any one temple,  one might at first be tempted to think that the decoration does not form a  connected whole, and that, although many series of scenes must undoubtedly  contain the development of an historic idea or a religious dogma, yet that  others are merely strung together without any necessary link. At Luxor, and  again at the Ramesseum, each face of the pylon is a battle-field on which  may be studied, almost day for day, the campaign of Rameses II. against the  Kheta, which took place in the fifth year of his reign. There we see the  Egyptian camp attacked by night; the king's bodyguard surprised during the  march; the defeat of the enemy; their flight; the garrison of Kadesh  sallying forth to the relief of the vanquished; and the disasters which  befell the prince of the Kheta and his generals. Elsewhere, it is not the  war which is represented, but the human sacrifices which anciently  celebrated the close of each campaign. The king is seen in the act of  seizing his prostrate prisoners by the hair of their heads, and uplifting  his mace as if about to shatter their heads at a single blow. At Karnak,  along the whole length of the outer wall, Seti I. pursues the Bedawin of  Sinai. At Medinet Habu Rameses III. destroys the fleet of the peoples of  the great sea, or receives the cut-off hands of the Libyans, which his  soldiers bring to him as trophies. In the next scene, all is peace; and we  behold Pharaoh pouring out a libation of perfumed water to his father Amen.  It would seem as if no link could be established between these subjects,  and yet the one is the necessary consequence of the others. If the god had  not granted victory to the king, the king in his turn would not have  performed these ceremonies in the temple. The sculptor has recorded the  events in their order:--first the victory, then the sacrifice. The favour  of the god precedes the thank-offering of the king. Thus, on closer  examination, we find this multitude of episodes forming the several links  of one continuous chain, while every scene, including such as seem at first  sight to be wholly unexplained, represents one stage in the development of  a single action which begins at the door, is carried through the various  halls, and penetrates to the farthest recesses of the sanctuary. The king  enters the temple. In the courts, he is everywhere confronted by  reminiscences of his victories; and here the god comes forth to greet him,  hidden in his shrine and surrounded by priests. The rites prescribed for  these occasions are graven on the walls of the hypostyle hall in which they  were performed. These being over, king and god together take their way to  the sanctuary. At the door which leads from the public hall to the  mysterious part of the temple, the escort halts. The king crosses the  threshold alone, and is welcomed by the gods. He then performs in due order  all the sacred ceremonies enjoined by usage. His merits increase by virtue  of his prayers; his senses become exalted; he rises to the level of the  divine type. Finally he enters the sanctuary, where the god reveals himself  unwitnessed, and speaks to him face to face. The sculptures faithfully  reproduce the order of this mystic presentation:--the welcoming reception  on the part of the god; the acts and offerings of the king; the vestments  which he puts on and off in succession; the various crowns which he places  on his head. The prayers which he recites and the favours which are  conferred upon him are also recorded upon the walls in order of time and  place. The king, and the few who accompany him, have their backs towards  the entrance and their faces towards the door of the sanctuary. The gods,  on the contrary, or at least such as do not make part of the procession,  face the entrance, and have their backs turned towards the sanctuary. If  during the ceremony the royal memory failed, the king needed but to raise  his eyes to the wall, whereon his duties were mapped out for him.    [Illustration: Fig. 108.--Obelisk of Usertesen I., of Heliopolis.]    Nor was this all. Each part of the temple had its accessory decoration and  its furniture. The outer faces of the pylons were ornamented, not only with  the masts and streamers before mentioned, but with statues and obelisks.  The statues, four or six in number, were of limestone, granite, or  sandstone. They invariably represented the royal founder, and were  sometimes of prodigious size. The two Memnons seated at the entrance of the  temple of Amenhotep III., at Thebes, measured about fifty feet in height.  The colossal Rameses II. of the Ramesseum measured fifty-seven feet, and  that of Tanis at least seventy feet. The greater number, however, did not  exceed twenty feet. They mounted guard before the temple, facing outwards,  as if confronting an approaching enemy. The obelisks of Karnak are mostly  hidden amid the central courts; and those of Queen Hatshepsut were imbedded  for seventeen feet of their height in masses of masonry which concealed  their bases. These are accidental circumstances, and easy of explanation.  Each of the pylons before which they are stationed had in its turn been the  entrance to the temple, and was thrown into the rear by the works of  succeeding Pharaohs. The true place of all obelisks was in front of the  colossi, on each side of the main entrance.[22] They are always in pairs,  but often of unequal height. Some have professed to see in them the emblem  of Amen, the Generator; or a finger of the god; or a ray of the sun. In  sober truth, they are a more shapely form of the standing stone, or menhir,  which is raised by semi-civilised peoples in commemoration of their gods or  their dead. Small obelisks, about three feet in height, are found in tombs  as early as the Fourth Dynasty. They are placed to right and left of the  stela; that is to say, on either side of the door which leads to the  dwelling of the dead. Erected before the pylon-gates of temples, they are  made of granite, and their dimensions are considerable. The obelisk of  Heliopolis (fig. 108) measures sixty-eight feet in the shaft, and the  obelisks of Luxor stand seventy-seven and seventy-five and a half feet  high, respectively. The loftiest known is the obelisk of Queen Hatshepsut  at Karnak, which rises to a height of 109 feet. To convey such masses, and  to place them in equilibrium, was a sufficiently difficult task, and one is  at a loss to understand how the Egyptians succeeded in erecting them with  no other appliances than ropes and sacks of sand. Queen Hatshepsut boasts  that her obelisks were quarried, shaped, transported, and erected in seven  months; and we have no reason to doubt the truth of her statement.[23]    [Illustration: Fig. 109.--Obelisk of Usertesen I., Begig, Fayum.]    Obelisks were almost always square, with the faces slightly convex, and a  slight slope from top to bottom. The pedestal was formed of a single square  block adorned with inscriptions, or with cynocephali in high relief,  adoring the sun. The point was cut as a pyramidion, and sometimes covered  with bronze or gilt copper. Scenes of offerings to Ra Harmakhis, Hor, Tum,  or Amen are engraved on the sides of the pyramidion and on the upper part  of the prism. The four upright faces are generally decorated with only  vertical lines of inscription in praise of the king (Note 11). Such is the  usual type of obelisk; but we here and there meet with exceptions. That of  Begig in the Fayum (fig. 109) is in shape a rectangular oblong, with a  blunt top. A groove upon it shows that it was surmounted by some emblem in  metal, perhaps a hawk, like the obelisk represented on a funerary stela in  the Gizeh Museum. This form, which like the first is a survival of the  menhir, was in vogue till the last days of Egyptian art. It is even found  at Axum, in the middle of Ethiopia, dating from about the fourth century of  our era, at a time when in Egypt the ancient obelisks were being carried  out of the country, and none dreamed of erecting new ones. Such was the  accessory decoration of the pylon. The inner courts and hypostyle halls of  the temple contained more colossi. Some, placed with their backs against  the outer sides of pillars or walls, were half engaged in the masonry, and  built up in courses. At Luxor under the peristyle, and at Karnak between  each column of the great nave, were also placed statues of Pharaoh; but  these were statues of Pharaoh the victor, clad in his robe of state. The  right of consecrating a statue in the temple was above all a royal  prerogative; yet the king sometimes permitted private persons to dedicate  their statues by the side of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1441"],[0,"The Story of an African Farm (#16)"],[1,"and leather  gaiters, and in his hand he carried a little whip of rhinoceros hide.    Waldo started and looked up. Had there been a moment's time he would  have dug a hole in the sand with his hands and buried his treasure. It  was only a toy of wood, but he loved it, as one of necessity loves what  has been born of him, whether of the flesh or spirit. When cold eyes  have looked at it, the feathers are rubbed off our butterfly's wing  forever.    \"What have you here, my lad?\" said Bonaparte, standing by him, and  pointing with the end of his whip to the medley of wheels and hinges.    The boy muttered something inaudible, and half spread over the thing.    \"But this seems to be a very ingenious little machine,\" said Bonaparte,  seating himself on the antheap, and bending down over it with deep  interest. \"What is it for, my lad?\"    \"Shearing sheep.\"    \"It is a very nice little machine,\" said Bonaparte. \"How does it work,  now? I have never seen anything so ingenious!\"    There was never a parent who heard deception in the voice that praised  his child--his first-born. Here was one who liked the thing that had  been created in him. He forgot everything. He showed how the shears  would work with a little guidance, how the sheep would be held, and the  wool fall into the trough. A flush burst over his face as he spoke.    \"I tell you what, my lad,\" said Bonaparte emphatically, when the  explanation was finished, \"we must get you a patent. Your fortune is  made. In three years' time there'll not be a farm in this colony where  it isn't working. You're a genius, that's what you are!\" said Bonaparte,  rising.    \"If it were made larger,\" said the boy, raising his eyes, \"it would work  more smoothly. Do you think there would be any one in this colony would  be able to make it?\"    \"I'm sure they could,\" said Bonaparte; \"and if not, why I'll do my best  for you. I'll send it to England. It must be done somehow. How long have  you worked at it?\"    \"Nine months,\" said the boy.    \"Oh, it is such a nice little machine,\" said Bonaparte, \"one can't help  feeling an interest in it. There is only one little improvement, one  very little improvement, I should like to make.\"    Bonaparte put his foot on the machine and crushed it into the sand. The  boy looked up into his face.    \"Looks better now,\" said Bonaparte, \"doesn't it? If we can't have it  made in England we'll send it to America. Good-bye; ta-ta,\" he added.  \"You're a great genius, a born genius, my dear boy, there's no doubt  about it.\"    He mounted the grey mare and rode off. The dog watched his retreat with  cynical satisfaction; but his master lay on the ground with his head on  his arms in the sand, and the little wheels and chips of wood lay on  the ground around him. The dog jumped on to his back and snapped at the  black curls, till, finding that no notice was taken, he walked off to  play with a black beetle. The beetle was hard at work trying to roll  home a great ball of dung it had been collecting all the morning: but  Doss broke the ball, and ate the beetle's hind legs, and then bit off  its head. And it was all play, and no one could tell what it had lived  and worked for. A striving, and a striving, and an ending in nothing.        Chapter 1.XI. He Snaps.    \"I have found something in the loft,\" said Em to Waldo, who was  listlessly piling cakes of fuel on the kraal wall, a week after. \"It is  a box of books that belonged to my father. We thought Tant Sannie had  burnt them.\"    The boy put down the cake he was raising and looked at her.    \"I don't think they are very nice, not stories,\" she added, \"but you can  go and take any you like.\"    So saying, she took up the plate in which she had brought his breakfast,  and walked off to the house.    After that the boy worked quickly. The pile of fuel Bonaparte had  ordered him to pack was on the wall in half an hour. He then went to  throw salt on the skins laid out to dry. Finding the pot empty, he went  to the loft to refill it.    Bonaparte Blenkins, whose door opened at the foot of the ladder, saw the  boy go up, and stood in the doorway waiting for his return. He wanted  his boots blacked. Doss, finding he could not follow his master up the  round bars, sat patiently at the foot of the ladder. Presently he looked  up longingly, but no one appeared. Then Bonaparte looked up also, and  began to call; but there was no answer. What could the boy be doing? The  loft was an unknown land to Bonaparte. He had often wondered what was  up there; he liked to know what was in all locked-up places and  out-of-the-way corners, but he was afraid to climb the ladder. So  Bonaparte looked up, and in the name of all that was tantalizing,  questioned what the boy did up there. The loft was used only as a  lumber-room. What could the fellow find up there to keep him so long?    Could the Boer-woman have beheld Waldo at that instant, any lingering  doubt which might have remained in her mind as to the boy's insanity  would instantly have vanished. For, having filled the salt-pot, he  proceeded to look for the box of books among the rubbish that filled the  loft. Under a pile of sacks he found it--a rough packing-case, nailed  up, but with one loose plank. He lifted that, and saw the even backs of  a row of books. He knelt down before the box, and ran his hand along its  rough edges, as if to assure himself of its existence. He stuck his hand  in among the books, and pulled out two. He felt them, thrust his fingers  in among the leaves, and crumpled them a little, as a lover feels the  hair of his mistress. The fellow gloated over his treasure. He had had  a dozen books in the course of his life; now here was a mine of them  opened at his feet. After a while he began to read the titles, and now  and again opened a book and read a sentence; but he was too excited to  catch the meanings distinctly. At last he came to a dull, brown volume.  He read the name, opened it in the centre, and where he opened began  to read. It was a chapter on property that he fell upon--Communism,  Fourierism, St. Simonism, in a work on Political Economy. He read down  one page and turned over to the next; he read down that without changing  his posture by an inch; he read the next, and the next, kneeling up all  the while with the book in his hand, and his lips parted.    All he read he did not fully understand; the thoughts were new to him;  but this was the fellow's startled joy in the book--the thoughts were  his, they belonged to him. He had never thought them before, but they  were his.    He laughed silently and internally, with the still intensity of  triumphant joy.    So, then, all thinking creatures did not send up the one cry--\"As thou,  dear Lord, has created things in the beginning, so are they now, so  ought they to be, so will they be, world without end; and it doesn't  concern us what they are. Amen.\" There were men to whom not only kopjes  and stones were calling out imperatively, \"What are we, and how came  we here? Understand us, and know us;\" but to whom even the old, old  relations between man and man, and the customs of the ages called, and  could not be made still and forgotten.    The boy's heavy body quivered with excitement. So he was not alone, not  alone. He could not quite have told any one why he was so glad, and  this warmth had come to him. His cheeks were burning. No wonder that  Bonaparte called in vain, and Doss put his paws on the ladder, and  whined till three-quarters of an hour had passed. At last the boy put  the book in his breast and buttoned it tightly to him. He took up the  salt pot, and went to the top of the ladder. Bonaparte, with his hands  folded under his coat-tails, looked up when he appeared, and accosted  him.    \"You've been rather a long time up there, my lad,\" he said, as the  boy descended with a tremulous haste, most unlike his ordinary slow  movements. \"You didn't hear me calling, I suppose?\"    Bonaparte whisked the tails of his coat up and down as he looked at him.  He, Bonaparte Blenkins, had eyes which were very far-seeing. He looked  at the pot. It was rather a small pot to have taken three-quarters of  an hour in the filling. He looked at the face. It was flushed. And yet,  Tant Sannie kept no wine--he had not been drinking; his eyes were  wide open and bright--he had not been sleeping; there was no girl up  there--he had not been making love. Bonaparte looked at him sagaciously.  What would account for the marvellous change in the boy coming down the  ladder from the boy going up the ladder? One thing there was. Did not  Tant Sannie keep in the loft bultongs, and nice smoked sausages? There  must be something nice to eat up there! Aha! that was it!    Bonaparte was so interested in carrying out this chain of inductive  reasoning that he quite forgot to have his boots blacked.    He watched the boy shuffle off with the salt-pot under his arm; then  he stood in his doorway and raised his eyes to the quiet blue sky, and  audibly propounded this riddle to himself:    \"What is the connection between the naked back of a certain boy with a  greatcoat on and a salt-pot under his arm, and the tip of a horsewhip?  Answer: No connection at present, but there will be soon.\"    Bonaparte was so pleased with this sally of his wit that he chuckled a  little and went to lie down on his bed.    There was bread-baking that afternoon, and there was a fire lighted  in the brick oven behind the house, and Tant Sannie had left the great  wooden-elbowed chair in which she passed her life, and waddled out to  look at it. Not far off was Waldo, who, having thrown a pail of food  into the pigsty, now leaned over the sod wall looking at the pigs. Half  of the sty was dry, but the lower half was a pool of mud, on the edge of  which the mother sow lay with closed eyes, her ten little ones sucking;  the father pig, knee-deep in the mud, stood running his snout into a  rotten pumpkin and"]]]
