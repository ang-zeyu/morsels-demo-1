But in spite of all this, I felt how much better it was to dream, or to  hear this poem of a youthful soul at a concert. It is then that the  magic murmurs of the forest in the second act speak more directly to the  heart. However beautiful the scenery of glades and woods, however  cleverly the light is made to change and dance among the trees--and it  is manipulated now like a set of organ stops--it still seems almost  wrong to listen with open eyes to music that, unaided, can show us a  glorious summer's day, and make us see the swaying of the tree-tops, and  hear the brush of the wind against the leaves. Through the music alone  the hum and murmur of a thousand little voices is about us, the glorious  song of the birds floats into the depths of a blue sky; or comes a  silence, vibrating with invisible life, when Nature, with her mysterious  smile, opens her arms and hushes all things in a divine sleep.           *       *       *       *       *    Wagner left _Siegfried_ asleep in the forest in order to embark on the  funereal vessel of _Tristan und Isolde_. But he left Siegfried with some  anguish of heart. When writing to Liszt in 1857, he says:         \"I have taken young Siegfried into the depths of a lonely forest;       there I have left him under a lime-tree, and said good-bye to him       with tears in my eyes. It has torn my heart to bury him alive, and       I had a hard and painful fight with myself before I could do it....       Shall I ever go back to him? No, it is all finished. Don't let us       speak of it again.\"    Wagner had reason to be sad. He knew well that he would never find his  young Siegfried again. He roused him up ten years later. But all was  changed. That splendid third act has not the freshness of the first two.  Wotan has become an important figure, and brought reason and pessimism  with him into the drama. Wagner's later conceptions were perhaps  loftier, and his genius was more master of itself (think of the classic  dignity in the awakening of Bruennhilde); but the ardour and happy  expression of youth is gone. I know that this is not the opinion of most  of Wagner's admirers; but, with the exception of a few pages of sublime  beauty, I have never altogether liked the love scenes at the end of  _Siegfried_ and at the beginning of _Goetterdaemmerung_. I find their  style rather pompous and declamatory; and their almost excessive  refinement makes them border upon dulness. The form of the duet, too,  seems cut and dried, and there are signs of weariness in it. The  heaviness of the last pages of _Siegfried_ recalls _Die Meistersinger_,  which is also of that period. It is no longer the same joy nor the same  quality of joy that is found in the earlier acts.    Yet it does not really matter, for joy is there, nevertheless; and so  splendid was the first inspiration of the work that the years have not  dimmed its brilliancy. One would like to end with _Siegfried_, and  escape the gloomy _Goetterdaemmerung_. For those who have sensitive  feelings the fourth day of the Tetralogy has a depressing effect. I  remember the tears I have seen shed at the end of the _Ring_, and the  words of a friend, as we left the theatre at Bayreuth and descended the  hill at night: \"I feel as though I were coming away from the burial of  someone I dearly loved.\" It was truly a time of mourning. Perhaps there  was something incongruous in building such a structure when it had  universal death for its conclusion--or at least in making the whole an  object of show and instruction. _Tristan_ achieves the same end with  much more power, as the action is swifter. Besides that, the end of  _Tristan_ is not without comfort, for life there is terrible. But it is  not the same in _Goetterdaemmerung_; for in spite of the absurdity of the  spell which is set upon the love of Siegfried and Bruennhilde, life with  them is happy and desirable, since they are beings capable of love, and  death appears to be a splendid but awful catastrophe. And one cannot say  the _Ring_ breathes a spirit of renunciation and sacrifice like  _Parsifal_; renunciation and sacrifice are only talked about in the  _Ring_; and, in spite of the last transports which impel Bruennhilde to  the funeral pyre, they are neither an inspiration nor a delight. One has  the impression of a great gulf yawning at one's feet, and the anguish of  seeing those one loves fall into it.    I have often regretted that Wagner's first conception of _Siegfried_  changed in the course of years; and in spite of the magnificent  _denouement_ of _Goetterdaemmerung_ (which is really more effective in a  concert room, for the real tragedy ends with Siegfried's death), I  cannot help thinking with regret how fine a more optimistic poem from  this revolutionary of '48 might have been. People tell me that it would  then have been less true to life. But why should it be truthful to  depict life only as a bad thing? Life is neither good nor bad it is just  what we make it, and the result of the way in which we look at it. Joy  is as real as sorrow, and a very fertile source of action. What  inspiration there is in the laugh of a great man! Let us welcome,  therefore, the sparkling if transient gaiety of _Siegfried_.    Wagner wrote to Malwida von Meysenbug: \"I have, by chance, just been  reading Plutarch's life of Timoleon. That life ended very happily--a  rare and unheard-of thing, especially in history. It does one good to  think that such a thing is possible. It moved me profoundly.\"    I feel the same when I hear _Siegfried_. We are rarely allowed to  contemplate happiness in great tragic art; but when we may, how splendid  it is, and how good for one!          \"TRISTAN\"      Tristan towers like a mountain above all other love poems, as Wagner  above all other artists of his century. It is the outcome of a sublime  conception, though the work as a whole is far from perfect. Of perfect  works there is none where Wagner is concerned. The effort necessary for  the creation of them was too great to be long sustained; for a single  work might means years of toil. And the tense emotions of a whole drama  cannot be expressed by a series of sudden inspirations put into form the  moment they are conceived. Long and arduous labour is necessary. These  giants, fashioned like Michelangelo's, these concentrated tempests of  heroic force and decadent complexity, are not arrested, like the work of  a sculptor or painter, in one moment of their action; they live and go  on living in endless detail of sensation. To expect sustained  inspiration is to expect what is not human. Genius may reveal what is  divine; it may call up and catch a glimpse of _die Muetter_, but it  cannot always breathe in the exhausted air of this world. So will must  sometimes take the place of inspiration; though the will is uncertain  and often stumbles in its task. That is why we encounter things that jar  and jolt in the greatest works--they are the marks of human weakness.  Well, perhaps there is less weakness in _Tristan_ than in Wagner's  other dramas--_Goetterdaemmerung_, for instance--for nowhere else is the  effort of his genius more strenuous or its flight more dizzy. Wagner  himself knew it well. His letters show the despair of a soul wrestling  with its familiar spirit, which it clutches and holds, only to lose  again. And we seem to hear cries of pain, and feel his anger and  despair.         \"I can never tell you what a really wretched musician I am. In my       inmost heart I know I am a bungler and an absolute failure. You       should see me when I say to myself, 'It ought to go now,' and sit       down to the piano and put together some miserable rubbish, which I       fling away again like an idiot. I know quite well the kind of       musical trash I produce.... Believe me, it is no good expecting me       to do anything decent. Sometimes I really think it was Reissiger       who inspired me to write _Tannhaeuser_ and _Lohengrin_.\"    This is how Wagner wrote to Liszt when he was finishing this amazing  work of art. In the same way Michelangelo wrote to his father in 1509:  \"I am in agony. I have not dared to ask the Pope for anything, because  my work does not make sufficient progress to merit any remuneration. The  work is too difficult, and indeed it is not my profession. I am wasting  my time to no purpose. Heaven help me!\" For a year he had been working  at the ceiling of the Sixtine chapel.    This is something more than a burst of modesty. No one had more pride  than Michelangelo or Wagner; but both felt the defects of their work  like a sharp wound. And although those defects do not prevent their  works from being the glory of the human spirit, they are there just the  same.    I do not want to dwell upon the inherent imperfections of Wagner's  dramas; they are really dramatic or epic symphonies, impossible to act,  and gaining nothing from representation. This is especially true of  _Tristan_, where the disparity between the storm of sentiment depicted,  and the cold convention and enforced timidity of action on the stage, is  such that at certain moments--in the second act, for example--it pains  and shocks one, and seems almost grotesque.    But while admitting that _Tristan_ is a symphony that is not suitable  for representation, one also recognises its blemishes and, above all,  its unevenness. The orchestration in the first act is often rather thin,  and the plot lacks solidity. There are gaps and unaccountable holes, and  melodious lines left suspended in space. From beginning to end, lyrical  bursts of melody are broken by declamations, or, what is worse, by  dissertations. Frenzied whirlwinds of passion stop suddenly to give  place to recitatives of explanation or argument. And although these  recitatives are nearly always a great relief, although these  metaphysical reveries have a character of barbarous cunning that one  relishes, yet the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16469"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume II. (#16)"],[1,"of Chichester, being one of those persons  of unblemished reputation, that his Majesty, tho' late, promoted to  that honourable office; which he possessed without any removal, save  that by the members of the Long Parliament, to the time of his death.    When he was young he delighted much in the study of music and poetry,  which with his wit and fancy made his conversation very agreeable, and  when he was more advanced in years he applied himself to oratory,  philosophy, and divinity, in which he became eminent.    It happened that this bishop attending divine service in a church at  Langley in Bucks, and hearing there a psalm sung, whose wretched  expression, far from conveying the meaning of the Royal Psalmist, not  only marred devotion, but turned what was excellent in the original  into downright burlesque; he tried that evening if he could not  easily, and with plainness suitable to the lowest understanding,  deliver it from that garb which rendered it ridiculous. He finished  one psalm, and then another, and found the work so agreeable and  pleasing, that all the psalms were in a short time compleated; and  having shewn the version to some friends of whose judgment he had a  high opinion, he could not resist their importunity (says Wood) of  putting it to the press, or rather he was glad their sollicitations  coincided with his desire to be thought a poet.    He was the more discouraged, says the antiquary, as Mr. George  Sandys's version and another by a reformer had failed in two different  extremes; the first too elegant for the vulgar use, changing both  metre and tunes, wherewith they had been long acquainted; the other as  flat and poor, and as lamely executed as the old one. He therefore  ventured in a middle way, as he himself in one of his letters  expresses it, without affectation of words, and endeavouring to leave  them not disfigured in the sense. This version soon after was  published with this title;    The Psalms of David from the New Translation of the Bible, turned into  Metre, to be sung after the old tunes used in churches, Lond. 1651, in  12mo.    There is nothing more ridiculous than this notion of the vulgar of not  parting with their old versions of the psalms, as if there were a  merit in singing hymns of nonsense. Tate and Brady's version is by far  the most elegant, and best calculated to inspire devotion, because the  language and poetry are sometimes elevated and sublime; and yet for  one church which uses this version, twenty are content with that of  Sternhold and Hopkins, the language and poetry of which, as Pope says  of Ogilvy's Virgil, are beneath criticism.--    After episcopacy was silenced by the Long Parliament, he resided in  the house of Sir Richard Hobbart (who had married his sister) at  Langley in Bucks. He was reinstated in his See by King Charles II. and  was much esteemed by the virtuous part of his neighbours, and had the  blessings of the poor and distressed, a character which reflects the  highest honour upon him.    Whether from a desire of extending his beneficence, or instigated by  the restless ambition peculiar to the priesthood, he sollicited, but  in vain, a higher preferment, and suffered his resentment to betray  him into measures not consistent with his episcopal character. He died  on the first day of October 1669[2], and was buried on the south side  of the choir, near the communion table, belonging to the cathedral  church in Chichester. Soon after there was a monument put over his  grave, with an inscription, in which it is said he was,       Antiqua, eaque regia Saxonium apud Danmonios in agro Devoniensi,                            prosapia oriundus,    That he was,        Natalium Splendore illustris, pietate, Doctrina, et virtutibus                             illustrior, &c.    This monument was erected at the charge of his widow, Anne daughter of  Sir William Russel of Strensham in Worcestershire, knight and baronet.

We shall take a quotation from his version of the 104th psalm.      My soul the Lord for ever bless:      O God! thy greatness all confess;    Whom majesty and honour vest,      In robes of light eternal drest.      He heaven made his canopy;      His chambers in the waters lye:    His chariot is the cloudy storm,      And on the wings of wind is born.      He spirits makes his angels quire,      His ministers a flaming fire.    He so did earth's foundations cast,      It might remain for ever fast:      Then cloath'd it with the spacious deep,      Whose wave out-swells the mountains steep.    At thy rebuke the waters fled,      And hid their thunder-frighted head.      They from the mountains streaming flow,      And down into the vallies go:    Then to their liquid center hast,      Where their collected floods are cast.      These in the ocean met, and joyn'd,      Thou hast within a bank confin'd:    Not suff'ring them to pass their bound,      Lest earth by their excess be drown'd.      He from the hills his chrystal springs      Down running to the vallies brings:    Which drink supply, and coolness yield,      To thirsting beasts throughout the field.      By them the fowls of heaven rest,      And singing in their branches nest.    He waters from his clouds the hills;      The teeming earth with plenty fills.      He grass for cattle doth produce,      And every herb for human use:    That so he may his creatures feed,      And from the earth supply their need.      He makes the clusters of the vine,      To glad the sons of men with wine.    He oil to clear the face imparts,      And bread, the strength'ner of their hearts.      The trees, which God for fruit decreed,      Nor sap, nor moistning virtue need.    The lofty cedars by his hand      In Lebanon implanted stand.      Unto the birds these shelter yield,      And storks upon the fir-trees build:    Wild goats the hills defend, and feed,      And in the rocks the conies breed.      He makes the changing moon appear,      To note the seasons of the year:    The sun from him his strength doth get,      And knows the measure of his set.      Thou mak'st the darkness of the night,      When beasts creep forth that shun the light,    Young lions, roaring after prey,      From God their hunger must allay.      When the bright sun casts forth his ray,      Down in their dens themselves they lay.    Man's labour, with the morn begun,      Continues till the day be done.      O Lord! what wonders hast thou made,      In providence and wisdom laid!    The earth is with thy riches crown'd,      And seas, where creatures most abound.      There go the ships which swiftly fly;      There great Leviathan doth lye,    Who takes his pastime in the flood:      All these do wait on thee for food.      Thy bounty is on them distill'd,      Who are by thee with goodness fill'd.    But when thou hid'st thy face, they die,      And to their dust returned lie.      Thy spirit all with life endues,      The springing face of earth renews,    God's glory ever shall endure,      Pleas'd in his works, from change secure.      Upon the earth he looketh down,      Which shrinks and trembles at his frown:    His lightnings touch, or thunders stroak,      Will make the proudest mountains smoak.      To him my ditties, whilst I live,      Or being have, shall praises give:    My meditations will be sweet,      When fixt on him my comforts meet.      Upon the earth let sinners rot,      In place, and memory forgot.    But thou, my soul, thy maker bless:      Let all the world his praise express;    Footnotes:  1. Athen.
