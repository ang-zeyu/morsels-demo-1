Romulus, now recovered from the blow, endeavoured to  stay the fugitives, and with loud shouts called upon them to stand firm  and fight. But as the stream of fugitives poured on, and no one had the  courage to face round, he lifted his hands to heaven and prayed to  Jupiter to stay the army and not to allow the tottering state of Rome to  fall, but to help it. After his prayer many were held back from flight  by reverence for the king, and the fugitives suddenly resumed their  confidence. They made their first stand where now is the temple of  Jupiter Stator, which one may translate \"He who makes to stand firm;\"  and then forming their ranks once more they drove back the Sabines as  far as what is now called the Palace, and the Temple of Vesta.    XIX. While they were preparing to fight as though the battle was only  now just begun, they were restrained by a strange spectacle, beyond the  power of words to express. The daughters of the Sabines who had been  carried off were seen rushing from all quarters, with loud shrieks and  wailings, through the ranks and among the dead bodies, as though  possessed by some god. Some of them carried infant children in their  arms, and others wore their hair loose and dishevelled. All of them kept  addressing the Romans and the Sabines alternately by the most endearing  names. The hearts of both armies were melted, and they fell back so as  to leave a space for the women between them. A murmur of sorrow ran  through all the ranks, and a strong feeling of pity was excited by the  sight of the women, and by their words, which began with arguments and  upbraidings, but ended in entreaties and tears. \"What wrong have we done  to you,\" said they, \"that we should have suffered and should even now  suffer such cruel treatment at your hands? We were violently and  wrongfully torn away from our friends, and after we had been carried off  we were neglected by our brothers, fathers, and relatives for so long a  time, that now, bound by the closest of ties to our enemies, we tremble  for our ravishers and wrongers when they fight, and weep when they fall.  Ye would not come and tear us from our ravishers while we were yet  maidens, but now ye would separate wives from their husbands, and  mothers from their children, a worse piece of service to us than your  former neglect. Even if it was not about us that you began to fight, you  ought to cease now that you have become fathers-in-law, and  grandfathers, and relatives one of another. But if the war is about us,  then carry us off with your sons-in-law and our children, and give us  our fathers and relatives, but do not take our husbands and children  from us. We beseech you not to allow us to be carried off captive a  second time.\" Hersilia spoke at length in this fashion, and as the other  women added their entreaties to hers, a truce was agreed upon, and the  chiefs met in conference. Hereupon the women made their husbands and  children known to their fathers and brothers, fetched food and drink for  such as needed it, and took the wounded into their own houses to be  attended to there. Thus they let their friends see that they were  mistresses of their own houses, and that their husbands attended to  their wishes and treated them with every respect.    In the conference it was accordingly determined that such women as chose  to do so should continue to live with their husbands, free, as we have  already related, from all work and duties except that of spinning wool  (_talasia_); that the Romans and the Sabines should dwell together in  the city, and that the city should be called Rome, after Romulus, but  the Romans be called Quirites after the native city of Tatius; and that  they should both reign and command the army together. The place where  this compact was made is even to this day called the Comitium, for the  Romans call meeting _coire_.    XX. Now that the city was doubled in numbers, a hundred more senators  were elected from among the Sabines, and the legions were composed of  six thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry. They also established  three tribes, of which they named one Rhamnenses, from Romulus, another  Titienses from Tatius, and the third Lucerenses, after the name of a  grove to which many had fled for refuge, requiring asylum, and had been  admitted as citizens. They call a grove _lucus_. The very name of  _tribe_ and tribune show that there were three tribes. Each tribe was  divided into ten _centuries_, which some say were named after the women  who were carried off; but this seems to be untrue, as many of them are  named after places. However, many privileges were conferred upon the  women, amongst which were that men should make way for them when they  walked out, to say nothing disgraceful in their presence, or appear  naked before them, on pain of being tried before the criminal court; and  also that their children should wear the _bulla_, which is so called  from its shape, which is like a bubble, and was worn round the neck, and  also the broad purple border of their robe (_praetexta_).    The kings did not conduct their deliberations together, but each first  took counsel with his own hundred senators, and then they all met  together. Tatius dwelt where now is the temple of Juno Moneta, and  Romulus by the steps of the Fair Shore, as it is called, which are at  the descent from the Palatine hill into the great Circus. Here they say  the sacred cornel-tree grew, the legend being that Romulus, to try his  strength, threw a spear, with cornel-wood shaft, from Mount Aventine,  and when the spear-head sunk into the ground, though many tried, no one  was able to pull it out. The soil, which was fertile, suited the wood,  and it budded, and became the stem of a good-sized cornel-tree. After  the death of Romulus this was preserved and reverenced as one of the  holiest objects in the city. A wall was built round it, and whenever any  one thought that it looked inclined to droop and wither he at once  raised a shout to tell the bystanders, and they, just as if they were  assisting to put out a fire, called for water, and came from all  quarters carrying pots of water to the place. It is said that when Gaius  Caesar repaired the steps, and the workmen were digging near it, they  unintentionally damaged the roots, and the tree died.    XXI. The Sabines adopted the Roman system of months, and all that is  remarkable about them will be found in the 'Life of Numa.' But Romulus  adopted the large oblong Sabine shield, and gave up the round Argolic  shields which he and the Romans had formerly carried. The two nations  shared each other's festivals, not abolishing any which either had been  wont to celebrate, but introducing several new ones, among which are the  Matronalia, instituted in honour of the women at the end of the war, and  that of the Carmentalia. It is thought by some that Carmenta is the  ruling destiny which presides over a man's birth, wherefore she is  worshipped by mothers. Others say that she was the wife of Evander the  Arcadian, a prophetess who used to chant oracles in verse, and hence  surnamed Carmenta (for the Romans call verses _carmina_); whereas it is  generally admitted that her right name was Nicostrate. Some explain the  name of Carmenta more plausibly as meaning that during her prophetic  frenzy she was bereft of intellect; for the Romans call to lack,  _carcre_; and mind, _mentem_.    We have spoken before of the feast of the Palilia. That of the  Lupercalia would seem, from the time of its celebration, to be a  ceremony of purification; for it is held during the ominous days of  February, a month whose name one might translate by Purification; and  that particular day was originally called Febrate. The name of this  feast in Greek signifies that of wolves, and it is thought, on this  account, to be very ancient, and derived from the Arcadians who came to  Italy with Evander. Still this is an open question, for the name may  have arisen from the she-wolf, as we see that the Luperci start to run  their course from the place where Romulus is said to have been exposed.  The circumstances of the ritual are such as to make it hard to  conjecture their meaning. They slaughter goats, and then two youths of  good family are brought to them. Then some with a bloody knife mark the  foreheads of the youths, and others at once wipe the blood away with  wool dipped in milk. The youths are expected to laugh when it is wiped  away. After this they cut the skins of the goats into strips and run  about naked, except a girdle round the middle, striking with the thongs  all whom they meet. Women in the prime of life do not avoid being  struck, as they believe that it assists them in childbirth and promotes  fertility. It is also a peculiarity of this festival that the Luperci  sacrifice a dog. One Bontes, who wrote an elegiac poem on the origin of  the Roman myths, says that when Romulus and his party had killed  Amulius, they ran back in their joy to the place where the she-wolf  suckled them when little, and that the feast is typical of this, and  that the young nobles run,        \"As, smiting all they met, that day      From Alba Romulus and Remus ran.\"    The bloody sword is placed upon their foreheads in token of the danger  and slaughter of that day, and the wiping with the milk is in  remembrance of their nurse. Caius Acilius tells us that, before the  foundation of Rome, the cattle of Romulus and Remus were missing, and  they, after invoking Faunus, ran out to search for them, naked, that  they might not be inconvenienced by sweat; and that this is the reason  that the Luperci ran about naked. As for the dog, one would say that if  the sacrifice is purificatory, it is sacrificed on behalf of those who  use it. The Greeks, in their purificatory rites, sacrifice dogs, and  often make use of what is called Periskylakismos. But if this feast be  in honour of the she-wolf,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#16)"],[1,"science, the spirit and the grand bearing of his art. He has also  signed some fine posters, notably a _Bruant_ which is a masterpiece of  its kind.    Degas's deep influence can be found again in J.L. Forain, who has made  himself known by an immense series of drawings for the illustrated  papers, drawings as remarkable in themselves as they are, through their  legends, bitterly sarcastic in spirit. These drawings form a synthesis  of the defects of the _bourgeoisie_, which is at the same time amusing  and grave. They also concern, though less happily, the political world,  in which the artist, a little intoxicated with his success, has thought  himself able to exercise an influence by scoffing at the parliamentary  regime. Forain's drawing has a nervous character which does, however,  not weaken its science: every stroke reveals something and has an  astonishing power. In his less known painting can be traced still more  clearly the style and influence of his master Degas. They are generally  incidents behind the scenes and at night restaurants, where caricatured  types are painted with great force. But they are insistently  exaggerated, they have not the restraint, the ironical and discreet  plausibility, which give so much flavour, so much value to Degas's  studies. Nevertheless, Forain's pictures are very significant and are of  real interest. He is decidedly the most interesting newspaper  illustrator of his whole generation, the one whose ephemeral art most  closely approaches grand painting, and one of those who have most  contributed towards the transformation of illustration for the  contemporary press.    Jules Cheret has made for himself an important and splendid position in  contemporary art. He commenced as a lithographic workman and lived for a  long time in London. About 1870 Cheret designed his first posters in  black, white and red; these were at the time the only colours used. By  and by he perfected this art and found the means of adding other tones  and of drawing them on the lithographic stone. He returned to France,  started a small studio, and gradually carried poster art to the  admirable point at which it has arrived. At the same time Cheret drew  and painted and composed himself his models. About 1885 his name became  famous, and it has not ceased growing since. Some writers, notably the  eminent critic Roger Marx and the novelist Huysmans, hailed in Cheret an  original artist as well as a learned technician. He then exhibited  decorative pictures, pastels and drawings, which placed him in the first  rank. Cheret is universally known. The type of the Parisian woman  created by him, and the multi-coloured harmony of his works will not be  forgotten. His will be the honour of having invented the artistic  poster, this feast for the eyes, this fascinating art of the street,  which formerly languished in a tedious and dull display of commercial  advertisements. He has been the promoter of an immense movement; he has  been imitated, copied, parodied, but he will always remain inimitable.  He has succeeded in realising on paper by means of lithography, the  pastels and gouache drawings in which his admirable colourist's fancy  mixed the most difficult shades. In Cheret can be found all the  principles of Impressionism: opposing lights, coloured shadows,  complementary reflections, all employed with masterly sureness and  delightful charm. It is decorative Impressionism, conceived in a  superior way; and this simple poster-man, despised by the painters, has  proved himself equal to most. He has transformed the street, in the open  light, into a veritable Salon, where his works have become famous. When  this too modest artist decided to show his pictures and drawings, they  were a revelation. The most remarkable pastellists of the period were  astonished and admired his skill, his profound knowledge of technique,  his continual _tours-de-force_ which he disguised under a shimmering  gracefulness. The State had the good sense to entrust him with some  large mural decorations, in which he unfolded the scale of his sparkling  colours, and affirmed his spirit, his fancy and his dreamy art. Cheret's  harmonies remain secrets; he uses them for the representation of  characters from the Italian comedy, thrown with fiendish _verve_ upon a  background of a sky, fiery with the Bengal lights of a fairy-like  carnival, and he strangely intermingles the reality of the movements  with the most arbitrary fancy. Cheret has also succeeded in proving his  artistic descent by a beautiful series of drawings in sanguine: he  descends from Watteau, Boucher and Fragonard; he is a Frenchman of pure  blood; and when one has done admiring the grace and the happy animation  of his imagination, one can only be surprised to see on what serious and  sure a technique are based these decorations which appear improvised.  Cheret's art is the smile of Impressionism and the best demonstration  of the decorative logic of this art.    These are the four artists of great merit who have created the  transition between Impressionist painting and illustration. It would be  fit to put aside Toulouse-Lautrec, who was much younger, but his work is  too directly connected with that of Degas for one to take into account  the difference of age. He produced between 1887 and 1900 works which  might well have been ante-dated by fifteen years. We shall study in the  next chapter his Neo-Impressionist comrades, and we shall now speak of  some illustrators more advanced in years than he. The oldest in date is  the engraver Henri Guerard, who died three years ago. He had married Eva  Gonzales and was a friend of Manet's, many of whose works have been  engraved by him. He was an artist of decided and original talent, who  also occupied himself successfully with pyrogravure, and who was happily  inspired by the Japanese colour-prints. His etchings deserve a place of  honour in the folios of expert collectors; they are strong and broad. As  to the engraver Felix Buhot, he was a rather delicate colourist in  black and white; his Paris scenes will always be considered charming  works. In spite of his Spanish origin, the painter, _aquarelliste_, and  draughtsman Daniel Vierge, should be added to the list of the men  connected with Impressionism. His illustrations are those of a great  artist--admirable in colour, movement and observation; all the great  principles of Impressionism are embodied in them. But there are four  more illustrators of the first rank: Steinlen, Louis Legrand, Paul  Renouard and Auguste Lepere.    Steinlen has been enormously productive: he is specially remarkable for  his illustrations. Those which he has designed for Aristide Bruant's  volume of songs, _Dans la rue_, are masterpieces of their kind. They  contain treasures of bitter observation, quaintness and knowledge. The  soul of the lower classes is shown in them with intense truth, bitter  revolt and comprehensive philosophy. Steinlen has also designed some  beautiful posters, pleasing pastels, lithographs of incontestable  technical merit, and beautifully eloquent political drawings. It cannot  be said that he is an Impressionist in the strict sense of the word; he  applied his colour in flat tints, more like an engraver than a painter;  but in him too can be felt the stamp of Degas, and he is one of those  who best demonstrate that, without Impressionism, they could not have  been what they are.    The same may be said of Louis Legrand, a pupil of Felicien Rops, an  admirably skilful etcher, a draughtsman of keen vision, and a painter of  curious character, who has in many ways forestalled the artists of  to-day. Louis Legrand also shows to what extent the example of Manet and  Degas has revolutionised the art of illustration, in freeing the  painters from obsolete laws, and guiding them towards truth and frank  psychological study. Legrand is full of them, without resembling them.  We must not forget that, besides the technical innovation (division of  tones, study of complementary colours), Impressionism has brought us  novelty of composition, realism of character and great liberty in the  choice of subjects. From this point of view Rops himself, in spite of  his symbolist tendencies, could not be classed with any other group, if  it were not that any kind of classification in art is useless and  inaccurate. However that may be, Louis Legrand has signed some volumes  resplendent with the most seductive qualities.    Paul Renouard has devoted himself to newspaper illustration, but with  what surprising prodigality of spirit and knowledge! The readers of the  \"Graphic\" will know. This masterly virtuoso of the pencil might give  drawing-lessons to many members of the Institute! The feeling for the  life of crowds, psychology of types, spirited and rapid notation,  astonishing ease in overcoming difficulties--these are his undeniable  gifts. And again we must recognise in Renouard the example of Degas and  Manet. His exceptional fecundity only helps to give more authority to  his pencil. Renouard's drawings at the Exhibition of 1900 were, perhaps,  more beautiful than the rest of his work. There was notably a series of  studies made from the first platform of the Eiffel Tower, an  accumulation of wonders of perspectives framing scenes of such animation  and caprice as to take away one's breath.    Finally, Auguste Lepere appears as the Debucourt of our time. As  painter, pastellist and wood-engraver he has produced since 1870, and  has won for himself the first place among French engravers. It would be  difficult to recount the volumes, albums and covers on which the fancy  of his burin has played; but it is particularly in wood-engraving that  he stands without rival. Not only has he produced masterpieces of it,  but he has passionately devoted himself to raising this admirable art,  the glory of the beautiful books of olden days, and to give back to it  the lustre"]]]
