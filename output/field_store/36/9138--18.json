[Illustration: APPARATUS FOR THE TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY ORES.]    Quantities of refractory ores treated by this process are said to have  demonstrated that the whole of the gold in the ore is extracted. The  successful outcome of these trials is stated to have resulted in the  Anglo-French Exploration Co. acquiring the right to work the process  on the various gold fields of South Africa. It is anticipated that the  process will thus be immediately brought to a test by means of  apparatus erected on the gold fields under circumstances and  conditions of absolute practical work. As is well known, gold-bearing  ores in South Africa which are below the water line are, by reason of  the presence of sulphur, extremely difficult to deal with, and are  consequently of small commercial value. The gold in these ores, it is  maintained, will, by the new process, be extracted and saved, and make  all the difference between successful and unsuccessful mining in that  country.    It will have been seen that the peculiar and essential features of the  invention consist in subjecting every particle of the ore under  treatment to the process in all its stages instead of in bulk, thereby  insuring that no portion shall escape being acted upon by the gases  and the absorbing metal. This is done automatically and in a very  rapid manner. It is stated that this method of treatment is applicable  to all ores, the most refractory being readily reducible by its means.  The advantages claimed for this process are: simplicity of the  apparatus, it being practically automatic; that every particle of the  ore is separately acted upon in a rapid and efficient manner; that the  apparatus is adaptable to existing milling plants; and that there is  an absence of elaborate and expensive plant and of the refinements of  electrical or chemical science. These advantages imply that the work  can be done so economically as to commend the new process to the  favorable consideration of all who are interested in mines or mining  property.--_Iron._           *       *       *       *       *          REFINING SILVER BULLION.      A number of years ago the author devised a method for refining silver  bullion by sulphuric acid, in which iron was substituted for copper as  precipitant of silver, the principal feature being the separation of  pure crystals of silver sulphate. A full description of this process  may be found in Percy's Metallurgy, \"Silver and Gold,\" page 479. The  process has been extensively worked in San Francisco and in Germany in  refining bullion to the amount of more than a hundred million dollars'  worth of silver. Its more general application has been hampered,  however, by the circumstance that the patent had been secured by one  firm which limited itself to its utilization in its California works.  The patent having expired, the author lately introduced a modification  of the process by which the apparatus and manipulations are greatly  cheapened and simplified. In the following account is given a short  description of the process in its present shape.    _Preparing the Silver Sulphate._--The bullion, containing,  essentially, silver, copper and gold, is dissolved by boiling with  sulphuric acid in cast iron pots. The difference between the new  process and the usual practice consists in the use of a much larger  quantity of acid. Thus, in refining ordinary silver \"dore,\" four parts  of acid are used to one part of bullion. Of this acid one part is  chemically and mechanically consumed in the dissolving process, and  the remaining three parts are fully recovered and at once ready for  reutilization, as will be described hereafter. In the usual  process--understanding thereby, here and in the following, the process  practiced at the United States mints, for instance--two parts of acid  are employed for one of bullion; all of this is lost, partly through  the dissolving and partly in being afterward mixed with water,  previous to the precipitation of the silver by copper. Economy in acid  being therefore imperative, the silver solution finally becomes much  concentrated, and it requires high heat and careful management to  finish the solution of the bullion. Bars containing more than about 10  per cent. of copper cannot be dissolved at all, owing to the  separation of copper sulphate insoluble in the small amount of free  acid finally remaining. The advantage gained by dissolving bullion  with abundance of free acid in the improved process is so evident that  it merely requires to be pointed out. For bullion containing 20 per  cent. of copper the author employs six parts of acid to one of  bullion; for baser metal still more acid, and so on, never losing more  than the stochiometrical percentage of acid and recovering the  remainder. In this description he, however, confines himself to the  treatment of ordinary silver ore with less than 10 per cent. of  copper.    In the diagram A A represent two refining pots, 4 ft. in diameter and  3 ft. in depth, each capable of dissolving at one operation as much as  400 pounds of bullion. The acid is stored in the cast iron reservoir,  B, which is placed on a level sufficiently high to charge into A by  gravitation, and is composed of fresh concentrated acid mixed with the  somewhat dilute acid regained from a previous operation. After the  bullion is fully dissolved all the acid still available is run from B  into A A. The temperature and strength are thereby reduced, the fuming  ceases, any still undissolved copper sulphate dissolves, and the gold  settles. In assuming that the settling of the gold takes place in A  itself, the author follows the practice of the United States mints. In  private refineries, where refining is carried on continuously, the  settling may take place in an intermediate vessel, and A A be at once  recharged. Owing to the large amount of free acid present, the  temperature must fall considerably before the separation of silver  sulphate commences, and sufficient time may be allowed for settling if  the intermediate vessel be judiciously arranged.    [Illustration]    _Separating the Silver Sulphate._--The clarified solution is siphoned  off the gold from A A into C, which is an open cast iron pan, say 8  ft. by 4 ft. and 1 ft. deep. It is supported by means of a flange in  another larger pan--not shown in the diagram--into which water may be  admitted for cooling. Steam is blown into the acid solution, still  very hot, as soon as C is filled. The steam is introduced about 1 in.  below the surface of the liquid, blowing perpendicularly downward from  a nozzle made of lead pipe through an aperture 1/8 in. in diameter.  Under these circumstances the absorption of the steam is nearly  perfect, and takes place without any splashing. The temperature rises  with the increasing dilution, and may be regulated by the less  experienced by manipulating the cooling tank. An actual boiling is not  desired, because it protracts unnecessarily the operation by the less  perfect condensation of the steam. No separation of silver sulphate  occurs during this operation (and, consequently, there is no clotting  of the steam nozzle), the large amount of free acid, combined with the  increase of temperature, compensating for the diminution of the  solubility of the sulphate by the dilution. The most important point  in this procedure is to know when to stop the admission of steam. To  determine this, the operator takes a drop or two of the solution upon  a cold iron plate by means of a glass rod and observes whether after  cooling the sample congeals partly or wholly into a white mass of  silver bisulphate, or whether the silver separates as a monosulphate  in detached yellow crystals, leaving a mother liquor behind. As soon  as the latter point has been reached, steam is shut off and the  solution is allowed to crystallize, cold water being admitted into the  outer pan. The operator may now be certain that the liquid will no  longer congeal into a soft mass of silver bisulphate, which on contact  with water will disintegrate into powder, obstinately retaining a  large amount of free acid; but the silver will separate as a  monosulphate in hard and large yellow crystals retaining no acid and  preserving their physical characteristics when thrown into water.  After cooling to, say, 80 deg. F., the silver sulphate will have coated  the pan C about 1 in. thick. There will also be found a deposit of  copper sulphate when the mother acid, after having been used over and  over again, has been sufficiently saturated therewith. Lead sulphate  separates in a cloud, which, however, will hardly settle at this  stage.    The whole operation just described, which constitutes the most  essential feature of the author's improvement upon his old process  described in Dr. Percy's work, is a short one, as the acid requires by  no means great dilution. The steam has merely to furnish enough water  to dilute the free acid present to, say, 62 deg. B. Areometrical  determination is, of course, not possible, on account of the dissolved  sulphates.    _Reducing the Silver Sulphate to Fine Silver._--The mother acid is  pumped from C to the reservoir, B, for this purpose an iron pipe  connecting the top of B with a recess in the bottom of C. The tank, B,  is cast as a closed vessel, with a manhole in the top, which is  ordinarily kept closed by an iron plate resting on a rubber packing.  The air is exhausted from B by a steam injector, and the acid rises  from C and enters B without coming in contact with any valves. The  volume of fresh commercial acid necessary for another dissolving  operation, say 800 pounds, more or less, for refining 800 pounds of  bullion in A A, is lifted from some other receptacle into B "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#16)"],[1,"the  opinion of the people, as we understand the phrase. The \"dim common  populations\" had no more to do with the Government of England then  than they have to do with the Government of India now. At the same  time it must be remembered that the King could not rely upon mere  force. He had no standing army, and a popular rising would have  swept him almost without resistance from his throne. It is almost as  hard for us to imagine his position as to understand his character.  Parliament, judges, magistrates, were subordinate to his sovereign  will and pleasure. From the authority of the Pope he cut himself  free, and neither Clement VII. nor Paul III. was strong enough to  stand up against him. He could hold his own with France, with the  Empire, with Spain. The one Power he never ventured to defy was the  English people. It was the essence of the Tudor monarchy to rely  upon the masses rather than the classes, to keep the aristocracy  down by expressing the popular will. So far as Henry took part in  it, the Reformation was not religious at all. As Macaulay drily  remarks, he was a good Catholic who preferred to be his own Pope. He  knew very well that Englishmen would like him none the worse for  resisting the pretensions of Rome, for insisting on the royal  supremacy, for taking every possible step to secure the succession  in the male Tudor line. If in his callous indifference to the fate  of the men or women who stood in his way he appears scarcely human,  we must consider, with Bishop Stubbs, his awful isolation. The whole  burden of the State was upon him, and he could not share it. Not  till the reign of his elder daughter did his subjects realise the  horrors from which he had delivered them.    Hostile criticism, though it affected the opinion of scholars, did  Froude no harm with the public. Macaulay's popularity was at its  height in 1858. But Macaulay passes lightly in his Introduction over  the sixteenth century, and the reign of Henry VIII., or at least the  latter part of it, had never been so copiously illustrated before.  The Oxford Movement, which treated the Reformation as a  discreditable incident worthy of oblivion, had not much influence  with the laity. Nine Englishmen in ten were quite prepared to  glorify the reformers, and were by no means sorry to find how much  evidence there was for the good old English view of a Parliamentary  Church. The Statutes of Supremacy and of Praemunire, even the  execution of More and Fisher, reminded them that the Bishop of Rome  neither had nor ought to have any jurisdiction within this realm of  England. That \"gospel light first dawned from Boleyn's eyes\" might  be a paradox. It was, however, a paradox which contained a truth,  and it was by no means disagreeable to find that a popular king was  not a mere monster of iniquity. If Henry had been what Catholic  historians represented him, the mob would have pulled his palace  about his ears. The public bought the book, and read it; for the  style, though very unlike Macaulay's, was quite as easy to read. In  1860 appeared the two volumes dealing with Edward VI. And Mary,  which complete the former half of this great book. After the brief  and disturbed period of Edward's minority and Somerset's  Protectorate, the country enjoyed a true Catholic reign. Whatever  may have been the religion of Henry, there could be no doubt about  Mary's. Mary had only one use for Protestants, and that was to burn  them. Among her first victims were Latimer and Ridley, two bright  ornaments of Christian faith and practice, who committed the deadly  sin of believing that it was against the truth of Christ's natural  body to be in heaven and earth at the same time. To them soon  succeeded Cranmer, the father of the English liturgy, not a man of  unblemished character, but incomparably superior to Gardiner, to  Bonner, or to Pole. For Cranmer Froude had a peculiar affection, and  his account of the Archbishop's martyrdom is unsurpassed by any  other passage in the History. I need make no apology for quoting the  end of it; \"So perished Cranmer. He was brought out with the eyes of  his soul blinded to make sport for his enemies, and in his death he  brought upon them a wider destruction than he had effected by his  teaching while alive. Pole was appointed next day to the See of  Canterbury; but in other respects the Court had overreached  themselves by their cruelty. Had they been contented to accept the  recantation, they would have left the Archbishop to die broken-  hearted, pointed at by the finger of pitying scorn, and the  Reformation would have been disgraced in its champion. They were  tempted, by an evil spirit of revenge, into an act unsanctioned even  by their own bloody laws; and they gave him an opportunity of  redeeming his fame, and of writing his name in the roll of martyrs.  The worth of a man must be measured by his life, not by his failure  under a single and peculiar trial. The Apostle, though forewarned,  denied his Master on the first alarm of danger; yet that Master, who  knew his nature in its strength and its infirmity, chose him for the  rock on which He would build His Church.\"    It used to be said of Ernest Renan that he was toniours seminariste,  and there is a flavour of the pulpit in these beautiful sentences.  Beautiful indeed they are, and not more beautiful than true. The  implacable Mary, whose ghastly epithet clings to her for all time,  like the shirt of Nessus, found in Pole an apt and zealous pupil in  persecution. Both are excellent specimens of their Church, because  according to that Church they are absolutely blameless. Punctilious  in the discharge of all religious duties, they were chaste, sober,  frugal, and honest. They made long prayers. They tithed mint, and  anise, and cummin. They made clean the outside of the cup and  platter. They firmly believed that they were pleasing the Deity they  worshipped when they deluged England with blood. The spirit of the  Marian martyrs is one of the noblest tributes to the power of true  religion that the annals of Christendom contain. Henry' s victims  were few and conspicuous. Their crime, or alleged crime, was  treason. Mary's were obscure, and numbered by the hundred. Many of  them were artisans and mechanics, who, as Burghley afterwards said,  knew no faith except that they were called upon to abjure. They went  to the stake without a murmur, sustained against the terrors of  demonology by their own English hearts, by the love of their  friends, and by the grace of God. Tennyson, in his play of Queen  Mary, has put into the mouth of Pole some highly edifying sentiments  on the want of true faith which prompts persecution. Pole's example  was very different from these precepts. For the wretched Mary there  may be some excuse; she was perhaps not wholly sane. Her fixed idea,  that if she killed Protestants enough Heaven would give her a son,  was the conviction of a lunatic. Her own husband fled from her, and  left her with no earthly consolation save the stake. But Pole was  sane enough when he burnt better Christians than himself. The true  story of Mary's reign deserved to be told as Froude could tell it.  The tale has two sides, and is a warning which has been taken to  heart. Mary's subjects could not rebel. Her Spanish husband had  behind him the military strength of a great Power. But never again,  except during the brief and disastrous period which led to the  expulsion of the second James, has England endured a Catholic  sovereign. Neither her rulers nor her laws have always been just to  Catholics. To tolerate intolerance, though a truly Christian lesson,  is hard to learn. Mary Tudor and Reginald Pole taught the English  people once for all what the triumph of Catholicism meant. So long  as they are not supreme, Catholics are the best of subjects, of  citizens, of neighbours, of friends. There is only one country in  Europe where they are supreme now, and that country is Spain. They  might have been supreme in England for at least a century if it had  not been for the daughter of Katharine of Aragon and the Legate of  Julius III.    Froude had now completed the first part of his great History. The  second part, the reign of Elizabeth, was reserved for future issue  in separately numbered volumes. The death of Macaulay in December,  1859, left Froude the most famous of living English historians, and  the ugly duckling of the brood had become the glory of the family.  The reception of his first six volumes was a curious one. The  general public read, and admired. The few critics who were competent  to form an instructed and impartial opinion perceived that, while  there were errors in detail, the story of the English Reformation,  and of the Catholic reaction which followed it, had been for the  first time thoroughly told. Many years afterwards Froude said to  Tennyson that the most essential quality in an historian was  imagination. This true and profound remark is peculiarly liable to  be misunderstood. People who do not know what imagination means are  apt to confound it with invention, although the latter quality is  really the last resort of those who are destitute of the former.  Froude was an ardent lover of the truth, and desired nothing so much  as to tell it. But it must be the truth as perceived by him, not as  it might appear to others.* His readers are expected, if not to see  with his eyes, at least to look from his point of view. Honestly  believing that the Reformation was a great and beneficent fact in  the progress of mankind, he was incapable of treating it as a sinful  rebellion against the authority of the Church. Holding Henry VIII.,  with all his faults, to have been the champion of the laity against  the clergy, of spiritual and intellectual freedom against the Roman  yoke, he could not represent him as a monster of wickedness,  trampling on morality for his own selfish ends.
