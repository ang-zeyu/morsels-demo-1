Only special officials on special commissions heard  their cases.    The form of oaths for compurgation were specified for theft of  cattle, unsoundness of property bought, and money owed for a sale.  The defendant denied the accusation by sweating that \"By the Lord,  I am guiltless, both in deed and counsel, and of the charge of  which ... accuses me.\" A compurgator swore that \"By the Lord, the  oath is clean and unperjured which ... has sworn.\".

He claimed that the  former King, Edward, the Confessor, had promised the throne to him  when they were growing up together in Normandy, if Edward became  King of England and had no children. The Conquerer's men and  horses came in boats powered by oars and sails. The conquest did  not take long because of the superiority of his military expertise  to that of the English. He organized his army into three groups:  archers with bows and arrows, horsemen with swords and stirrups,  and footmen with hand weapons. Each group played a specific role  in a strategy planned in advance. The English army was only  composed of footmen with hand weapons such as spears and shields.  They fought in a line holding up their shields to overlap each  other and form a shieldwall. The defeat of the English was thought  to have been presaged by a comet.    At Westminster, he made an oath to defend God's holy churches and  their rulers, to rule the whole people subject to him with  righteousness and royal providence, to enact and hold fast right  law, and to utterly forbid rapine and unrighteous judgments. This  was in keeping with the traditional oath of a new king.    Declaring the English who fought against him to be traitors, the  Conquerer declared their land confiscated. But he allowed those  who were willing to acknowledge him to redeem their land by a  payment of money. As William conquered the land of the realm, he  parceled it out among the barons who fought with him so that each  baron was given the holdings of an Anglo-Saxon predecessor,  scattered though they were. The barons again made oaths of  personal loyalty to him [fealty]. They agreed to hold the land as  his vassals with future military services to him and receipt of  his protection. They gave him homage by placing their hands within  his and saying \"I become your man for the tenement I hold of you,  and I will bear you faith in life and member [limb] and earthly  honor against all men\". They held their land \"of their lord\", the  King, by knight's service. The king had \"enfeoffed\" them [given  them a fief: a source of income] with land. The theory that by  right all land was the King's and that land was held by others  only at his gift and in return for specified service was new to  English thought. The original duration of a knight's fee until  about 1100 was for his life; thereafter it was heritable. The word  \"knight\" came to replace the word \"thegn\" as a person who received  his position and land by fighting for the King. The exact  obligation of knight's service was to furnish a fully armed  horseman to serve at his own expense for forty days in the year.  This service was not limited to defense of the country, but  included fighting abroad. The baron led his own knights under his  banner. The foot soldiers were from the fyrd or were mercenaries.  Every free man was sworn to join in the defense of the king, his  lands and his honor, within England and without.    The Saxon governing class was destroyed. The independent power of  earls, who had been drawn from three great family houses, was  curtailed. Most died or fled the country. Some men were allowed to  redeem their land by money payment if they showed loyalty to the  Conquerer. Well-born women crowded into nunneries to escape Norman  violence. The people were deprived of their most popular leaders,  who were excluded from all positions of trust and profit,  especially all the clergy. The earldoms became fiefs instead of  magistracies.    The Conquerer was a stern and fierce man and ruled as an autocrat  by terror. Whenever the people revolted or resisted his mandates,  he seized their lands or destroyed the crops and laid waste the  countryside and so that they starved to death. His rule was  strong, resolute, wise, and wary because he had learned to command  himself as well as other men. He was not arbitrary or oppressive.  The Conquerer had a strict system of policing the nation. Instead  of the Anglo-Saxon self-government throughout the districts and  hundreds of resident authorities in local courts, he aimed at  substituting for it the absolute rule of the barons under military  rule so favorable to the centralizing power of the Crown. He used  secret police and spies and the terrorism this system involved.  This especially curbed the minor barons and preserved the public  peace.    The English people, who outnumbered the Normans by 300 to 1, were  disarmed. Curfew bells were rung at 7:00 PM when everyone had to  remain in their own dwellings on pain of death and all fires and  candles were to be put out. This prevented any nightly gatherings,  assassinations, or seditions. Order was brought to the kingdom so  that no man dare kill another, no matter how great the injury he  had received. The Conquerer extended the King's peace on the  highways, i.e. roads on high ground, to include the whole nation.  Any individual of any rank could travel from end to end of the  land unharmed. Before, prudent travelers would travel only in  groups of twenty.    The barons subjugated the English who were on their newly acquired  land. There began a hierarchy of seisin [rightful occupation] of  land so that there could be no land without its lord. Also, every  lord had a superior lord with the king as the overlord or supreme  landlord. One piece of land may be held by several tenures. For  instance, A, holding by barons' service of the King, may enfeoff  B, a church, to hold of him on the terms of praying for the souls  of his ancestors, and B may enfeoff a freeman C to hold of the  church by giving it a certain percentage of his crops every year.  There were about 200 barons who held land directly of the King.  Other fighting men were the knights, who were tenants or  subtenants of a baron. Knighthood began as a reward for valor on  the field of battle by the king or a noble. The value of a  knight's fee was 400s. [20 pounds] per year. Altogether there were  about 5000 fighting men holding land.    The essence of Norman feudalism was that the land remained under  the lord, whatever the vassal might do. The lord had the duty to  defend the vassals on his land. The vassal owed military service  to the lord and also the service of attending the courts of the  hundred and the county [formerly \"shire\"], which were courts of  the King, administering old customary law. They were the King's  courts on the principle that a crime anywhere was a breach of the  King's peace. The King's peace that had covered his residence and  household had extended to places where he might travel, such as  highways, rivers, bridges, churches, monasteries, markets, and  towns, and then encompassed every place, replacing the general  public peace. Infraction of the King's peace incurred fines to  the King.    This feudal bond based on occupancy of land rather than on  personal ties was uniform throughout the realm. No longer could a  man choose his lord and transfer his land with him to a new lord.  He held his land at the will of his lord, to be terminated anytime  the lord decided to do so. A tenant could not alienate his land  without permission of his lord. In later eras, tenancies would be  held for the life of the tenant, and even later, for his life and  those of his heirs.    This uniformity of land organization plus the new requirement that  every freeman take an oath of loyalty directly to the king to  assist him in preserving his lands and honor and defending him  against his enemies, which oath would supersede any oath to any  other man, gave the nation a new unity. The king could call men  directly to the fyrd, summon them to his court, and tax them  without intervention of their lords. And the people learned to  look to the king for protection from abuse by their lords.    English villani, bordarii, cottarii, and servi on the land of the  barons were subjugated into a condition of \"villeinage\" servitude  and became \"tied to the land\" so that they could not leave the  land without their lord's permission, except to go on a  pilgrimage. The villeins formed a new bottom class as the  population's percentage of slaves declined dramatically. They held  their land of their lord, the baron. To guard against uprisings of  the conquered people, the barons used villein labor to build about  a hundred great stone castles, with moats and walls with towers  around them, at easily defensible positions such as hilltops all  over the nation.    A castle could be built only with permission of the King. A  typical castle had a stone building of about four floors [a keep]  on a small, steep hill. Later it also had an open area surrounded  by a stone curtain-wall with towers at the corners. Around the  outside of the wall were ditches and banks and perhaps a moat. One  traveled over these via a drawbridge let down at the gatehouse of  the enclosing wall.

THE FIFTH LESSON      THE ONE AND THE MANY.    As we have stated in previous Lessons, all philosophies which thinkers  have considered worthy of respect, find their final expression of Truth  in the fundamental thought that there is but _One Reality_, underlying  all the manifold manifestations of shape and form. It is true that the  philosophers have differed widely in their conception of that One, but,  nevertheless, they have all agreed upon the logical necessity of the  fundamental conception that there is, at least, but One Reality,  underlying All.    Even the Materialists have conceded this conclusion, and they speak and  think of a something called \"Matter,\" as the One--holding that,  inherent in Matter, is the potentiality of all Life. The school of  Energists, holding that Matter in itself is non-existent, and that it  is merely a mode of manifestation of a something called \"Energy,\"  asserts that this something called Energy is One, fundamental, real,  and self-sufficient.    The various forms of Western religious thought, which hold to the  various conceptions of a Personal Deity, also hold to a Oneness,  inasmuch as they teach that in the beginning there was God, only, and  that all the Universe has been _created_ by Him. They do not go into  details regarding this creation, and, unlike the Oriental teachers,  they fail to distinguish between the conception of the _creation of  shape and form_, on the one hand; and the _creation of the substance of  these shapes and forms_, on the other hand. But, even accepting the  premises of these people who hold to the Personal Deity conception, it  will be seen that the Reason requires the acceptance of one or two  ideas, _viz._, (1) That the Deity created the substance of these shapes  and forms from _Nothing_; or else (2) that he created them out of _his  own substance_--out of Himself, in fact. Let us consider, briefly,  these two conceptions.    In the first conception, _i.e._, Creation from Nothing, we are brought  face to face with an impregnable obstacle, inasmuch as the human reason  positively refuses to think of Anything coming from Nothing. While it  is perfectly true that the finite human mind cannot undertake to limit  the powers of the Infinite; or to insist that the possibilities of the  Divine Power must be measured and limited by the finite power of  Man--still it must hearken to the report of its own highest faculties,  and say \"I cannot Think it,\" or else blindly accept the teachings of  other finite minds which are equally unable to \"Think it,\" and which  have no superior sources of information. The Infinite Power has endowed  us with reasoning faculties, and evidently expects us to use them to  their full capacity--else the gift were a mockery. And in the absence  of information from higher sources than the Reason, we must use the  Reason in thinking of this matter, or else refuse to think of it at  all.    In view of the above thought, let us then consider the report of the  Reason, regarding this matter, And then, after having done so, let us  apply the test of this report of the Reason, to the highest teaching of  the Yogi Philosophy, and see how the latter stands the test. And, after  having done this, we will apply the test of the Higher Consciousness to  the same teachings. Remember this always, that while there is knowledge  that transcends Reason--that is knowledge that comes from the Higher  Regions of the Mind--still even such information of the Spiritual Mind  _does not run contrary to Reason_, although it goes beyond it. There is  harmony between the Spiritual Mind and the Highest Reason.    Returning to the consideration of the matter of Creation of Substance  from Nothing, we again assert that _the Reason is unable to think of  the creation of Something from Nothing_. It finds the statement  unthinkable, and contrary to all the laws of thought. It is true that  the Reason is compelled to accept as a final truth, many things that it  cannot _understand_ by reason of its finitude--but this is not one of  them. There is no logical necessity for the Reason to accept any such  conception as this--there is no warrant in the Reason for any such  theory, idea or conclusion. Let us stop here, for a moment, and examine  into this difference--it may help us to think clearer, hereafter.    We find it impossible to _understand_ the fact of the Infinite Being  having always existed--and Being without Cause. We find it impossible  to conceive of the nature of an Eternal, Causeless, and Infinite  Being--to conceive the _nature of_, such a Being, remember.    But, while this is so, still our Reason, by its own laws, compels us to  think that there _must be_ such a Being, so long as we think at all.  For, if we think at all, we _must_ think of there being a Fundamental  Reality--and we _must_ think of that Reality as being without Cause  (because there can be no Cause for the First Cause); and we _must_  think of that Reality as being Eternal (because It could not have  sprung into Being from Nothing, and therefore must have always been);  and we _must_ think of that Reality as Infinite (because there is  nothing outside of Itself to limit It). Think over this statement for a  moment--until you grasp it fully.    But there is no such necessity, or compulsion, in the case of the  question of Creation from Nothingness. On the contrary, the necessity  and compulsion is all the other way. Not only is the Reason unable to  _think of_ Creation from Nothing--not only does all its laws forbid it  to hold such a conception--but, more than this, it finds within itself  a conception, full-grown and potent, which contradicts this idea. It  finds within itself the strong certainty that _Whatever Really Is has  Always Been_, and that all transient and finite shapes, forms, and  manifestations, _must_ proceed from that which is Real, Infinite,  Causeless, and Infinite--and moreover _must be composed of the  substance of that Reality_, for there is nothing else Real from which  they could have been composed; and their composition from Nothing is  unthinkable, for Nothing is Nothing, and always will be Nothing.  \"Nothing\" is merely a name of denial of existence--an absolute denial  of substantiality of any degree, kind or form--an absolute denial of  Reality. And from such could come only Nothing--from Nothing, Nothing  comes.    Therefore, finding within itself the positive report that All, and  Anything There Is, must be composed of the Substance of the Reality,  the Reason is compelled to think that the Universe is composed of the  Substance of the One Reality--whether we call that One Reality, by the  name of The Absolute; or whether we call it God. _We must believe that  from this Absolute-God all things in the Universe have flown out, or  been emanated, rather than created--begotten, rather than \"made.\"_    This does not mean the Pantheistic idea that the Universe _is_ God--but  rather that God, while existing separate and apart from His Universe,  in his Essence, and Being, is nevertheless _in_ His Universe, and His  Universe _in_ Him. And this, no matter what conception of God or Deity  is had--or whether one thinks of The Absolute as Principle. The Truth  is the same--Truth no matter by what names it is called, or by what  misconception it is surrounded. The Truth is that _One is in All, and  All is in One_--such is the report of the highest Reason of Man--such  is the report of the Illumined--such is the Highest Teachings that have  come down to the race from the great souls that have trodden The Path  of Attainment.    And now let us submit the Yogi Philosophy to these conceptions, and  reports of the Reason. And let us discover just what more the Yogi  Philosophy has to say concerning the _nature of_ the Substance of the  Divine, which infills all Life--and how it solves the Riddle of the  Sphinx, concerning the One in All; and All in One. We hope to show you  that the Riddle is capable of solution, and that the old Yogi teachers  have long ago grasped that for which the human mind has ever sought.  This phase of the Teachings is the highest, and it is usually hinted  at, rather than expressed, in the writings on the subject--owing to  danger of confusion and misconception. But in these Lessons we shall  speak the Truth plainly, and without fear--for such is the Message  which has been given us to deliver to our students--and we will perform  the Right action, leaving the Result, or Fruits of the Action, where it"]]]
