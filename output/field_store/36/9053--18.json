'What was that?' asked the King. Far-sight related:--      THE STORY OF THE BRAHMAN AND THE PANS    \"There was a Brahman in the city of Vana, whose name was Deva Sarman. At  the equinoctial feast of the Dussera, he obtained for his duxina-gift a  dish of flour, which he took into a potter's shed; and there lay down in  the shade among the pots, staff in hand. As he thus reclined he began to  meditate, 'I can sell this meal for ten cowrie-shells, and with them I  can purchase some of these pots and sell them at an advance. With all  that money I shall invest in betel-nuts and body-cloths and make a new  profit by their sale; and so go on trafficking till I get a lakh of  rupees--what's to prevent me? Then I shall marry four wives--and one at  least will be beautiful and young, and she shall be my favorite. Of  course the others will be jealous; but if they quarrel, and talk, and  trouble me I will belabor them like this--and this'--and therewith he  flourished his staff to such a purpose as to smash his meal-dish and  break several of the potter's jars. The potter, rushing out, took him by  the throat, and turned him off; and so ended his speculations. I smiled,  my Liege,' concluded the Vulture, 'at your precipitancy, thinking of  that story.'    'Tell me, then, my Father, what should be done,' said the King.    'Tell me first, your Majesty, what took the fortress: strength or  stratagem?'    'It was a device of yours,' said the King.    'It is well,' replied the Minister, 'and my counsel now is to return  before the rainy season, while we can return; and to make peace. We have  won renown and taken the enemy's stronghold; let it suffice. I speak as  a faithful adviser; and it is written--        'Whoso setting duty highest, speaks at need unwelcome things,      Disregarding fear and favor, such a one may succor kings.'    Oh, my Liege! war is uncertain! Nay, it may ruin victor and  vanquished--        'Sunda the strong, and giant Upasunda,      Contending, like the lightning and the thunder,      Slew each the other. Learn, the while you wonder.'    'Tell me that,' said the King of the Peacocks.    'The Vulture related--      THE DUEL OF THE GIANTS    \"Long ago, my Liege, there were two Daityas named Sunda and Upasunda,  the which with penance and fasting worshipped that God who wears the  moon for his forehead-jewel; desiring to win his favor, and thereby the  lordship of the Three Worlds. At last the God, propitiated by their  devotion, spake thus unto them:--    'I grant a boon unto ye--choose what it shall be.'    'And they, who would have asked dominion, were suddenly minded of  Saraswati--who reigns over the hearts and thoughts of men--to seek a  forbidden thing.    'If,' said they, 'we have found favor, let the Divinity give us his own  cherished Parvati, the Queen of Heaven!'    'Terribly incensed was the God, but his word had passed, and the boon  must be granted; and Parvati the Divine was delivered up to them. Then  those two world-breakers, sick at heart, sin-blinded, and afire with the  glorious beauty of the Queen of Life--began to dispute, saying one to  another: 'Mine is she! mine is she!' At the last they called for an  umpire, and the God himself appeared before them as a venerable Brahman.    'Master,' said they, 'tell us whose she is, for we both won her by our  might.'    'Then spake that Brahman:--        'Brahmans for their lore have honor; Kshattriyas for their bravery;      Vaisyas for their hard-earned treasure; Sudras for humility,'    Ye are Kshattriyas--and it is yours to fight; settle, then, this  question by the sword.'    'Thereupon they agreed that he spoke wisely, and drew and battled; and  being of equal force, they fell at the same moment by an exchange of  blows. Good my Lord,' concluded the Minister, 'peace is a better thing  than war,'    'But why not say so before?' asked Jewel-plume.    'I said it at the first,' replied the Minister. 'I knew King  Silver-sides for a just King, upon whom it was ill to wage battle. How  say the Scriptures?--        'Seven foemen of all foemen, very hard to vanquish be:      The Truth-teller, the Just-dweller, and the man from passion free,      Subtle, self-sustained, and counting frequent well-won victories,      And the man of many kinsmen--keep the peace with such as these.'    The Swan-king has friends and kinsmen, my Liege:--        'And the man with many kinsmen answers with them all attacks;      As the bambu, in the bambus safely sheltered, scorns the axe.'    'My counsel then is that peace be concluded with him,' said the Vulture.    'All this King Silver-sides and his Minister the Goose heard attentively  from the Crane.    'Go again!' said the Goose to Long-bill, 'and bring us news of how the  Vulture's advice is received.'    'Minister!' began the King, upon the departure of the Crane, 'tell me as  to this peace, who are they with whom it should not be concluded?'    'They be twenty, namely----'    'Tarry not to name them,' said the King; 'and what be the qualities of a  good ally?'    'Such should be learned in Peace and War,' replied the Goose, 'in  marching and pitching, and seasonably placing an army in the field; for  it is said--        'He who sets his battle wisely, conquers the unwary foe;      As the Owl, awaiting night-time, slew the overweening Crow.'    Counsel, my Liege, is quintuple--Commencing, providing, dividing,  repelling, and completing,'    'Good!' said the King.    'Power is triple,' continued the Goose, 'being of Kings, of counsels,  and of constant effort.'    'It is so!' said the King.    'And expedients, my Liege,' continued the Goose, 'are quadruple, and  consist of conciliation, of gifts, of strife-stirring, and of force of  arms; for thus it is written--        'Whoso hath the gift of giving wisely, equitably, well;      Whoso, learning all men's secrets, unto none his own will tell;      Whoso, ever cold and courtly, utters nothing that offends,      Such a one may rule his fellows unto Earth's extremest ends.'    'Then King Jewel-plume would be a good ally,' observed the Swan-king.    'Doubtless!' said the Goose, 'but elated with victory, he will hardly  listen to the Vulture's counsel; we must make him do it.'    'How?' asked the King.    'We will cause our dependent, the King of Ceylon, Strong-bill the Stork,  to raise an insurrection in Jambudwipa.'    'It is well-conceived,' said the King. And forthwith a Crane, named  Pied-body, was dismissed with a secret message to that Rajah.    'In course of time the first Crane, who had been sent as a spy, came  back, and made his report. He related that the Vulture had advised his  Sovereign to summon Night-cloud, the Crow, and learn from him regarding  King Silver-sides' intentions. Night-cloud attended accordingly.    'Crow!' asked King Jewel-plume, 'what sort of a Monarch is the Rajah  Silver-sides?'    'Truthful, may it please you,' replied the Crow; 'and therewithal noble  as Yudisthira himself.'    'And his Minister, the Goose?'    'Is a Minister unrivalled, my Liege,' said the Crow-king.    'But how then didst thou so easily deceive them?'    'Ah! your Majesty,' said the Crow, 'there was little credit in that. Is  it not said?--        'Cheating them that truly trust you, 'tis a clumsy villainy!      Any knave may slay the child who climbs and slumbers on his knee.'    Besides, the Minister detected me immediately. It was the King whose  innate goodness forbade him to suspect evil in another:--        'Believe a knave, thyself scorning a lie,      And rue it, like the Brahman, by and by.'    'What Brahman was that?' asked the King. Night-cloud replied:--      THE STORY OF THE BRAHMAN AND THE GOAT    \"A Brahman that lived in the forest of Gautama, your Majesty. He had  purveyed a goat to make pooja, and was returning home with it on life  shoulder when he was descried by three knaves. 'If we could but obtain  that goat,' said they, 'it would be a rare trick'; and they ran on, and  seated themselves at the foot of three different trees upon the  Brahman's road. Presently he came up with the first of them, who  addressed him thus: 'Master! why do you carry that dog on your  shoulder?' 'Dog!' said the Brahman, 'it is a goat for sacrifice!' With  that he went on a coss, and came to the second knave; who called  out--'What doest thou with that dog, Master?' The Brahman laid his goat  upon the ground, looked it all over, took it up again upon his back, and  walked on with his mind in a whirl; for--        'The good think evil slowly, and they pay      A price for faith--as witness \"Crop-ear\" may.'    'Who was Crop-ear?' asked the King of the Peacocks.      THE STORY OF THE CAMEL, THE LION, AND HIS COURT    \"A Camel, may it please you,\" replied Night-cloud, \"who strayed away  from a kafila, and wandered into the forest. A Lion, named  'Fierce-fangs,' lived in that forest; and his three courtiers, a Tiger,  a Jackal, and a Crow, met the Camel, and conducted him to their King.  His account of himself was satisfactory, and the Lion took him into his  service under the name of Crop-ear. Now it happened that the rainy  season was very severe, and the Lion became indisposed, so that there  was much difficulty in obtaining food for the Court. The courtiers  resolved accordingly to prevail on the Lion to kill the Camel; 'for what  interest have we,' they said, 'in this browser of thistles?'    'What, indeed!' observed the Tiger; 'but will the Rajah kill him after  his promise of protection, think you?'    'Being famished he will,' said the Crow. 'Know you not?--        'Hunger hears not, cares not, spares not; no boon of the starving beg;      When the snake is pinched with craving, verily she eats her egg.'    Accordingly they repaired to the Lion.    'Hast brought me food, fellow?' growled the Rajah.    'None, may it please you,' said the Crow.    'Must we starve, then?' asked his Majesty.    'Not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13272"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 2 (#16)"],[1,"if I neglected doing so. I  therefore applied to various courts to subscribe to the Mass, fixing the  price at fifty ducats; the general opinion being that this was not too  much, and if there were a good many subscribers, the scheme would not be  unprofitable. Hitherto the subscription is indeed flattering to me, as  their Majesties of France and Prussia have each taken a copy. I also  received a letter from my friend Prince Nicolaus Gallizin a few days ago,  from Petersburg, in which this most amiable Prince mentions that H.M. the  Emperor of Russia had become a subscriber, and that I should soon hear  further on the subject from the Imperial Russian Embassy. Notwithstanding  all this (and though there are some other subscribers), I have not yet  realized as much as the sum a publisher offered me for it; the only  advantage being that the work remains _mine_. The costs of copying are also  great, and further increased by three new pieces being added, which, as  soon as they are completed, I will send to Y.R.H. Perhaps you would not  think it too much trouble to apply to H.R.H. the Grand Duke of Tuscany to  take a copy of this Mass. The application was indeed made some time ago to  the Grand Duke of Tuscany through the agent here, V. Odelga, who faithfully  assured me that the proposal would be graciously accepted. I place no great  faith, however, in this, as some months have elapsed, and no notice has  been again taken of the application. As the affair is now set agoing, it is  but natural that I should do all I can to attain my desired object. The  undertaking was from the first disagreeable to me, and still more so to  mention it to Y.R.H., or to allude to it at all, but \"_necessity has no  law_.\" I only feel grateful to Him who dwells above the stars that I now  begin once more to be able to use my eyes. I am at present writing a new  symphony for England,[4] bespoken by the Philharmonic Society, and hope it  will be quite finished fourteen days hence. I cannot strain my eyes as yet  long at a time; I beg therefore Y.R.H.'s indulgence with regard to your  Variations,[5] which appear to me very charming, but still require closer  revision on my part. Y.R.H. has only to persevere, especially to accustom  yourself to write down your ideas at once at the piano, quickly and  briefly. For this purpose a small table ought to be placed close beside the  piano. By this means not only is the imagination strengthened; but you  learn instantly to hold fast the most fugitive ideas. It is equally  necessary to be able to write without any piano; and sometimes a simple  choral melody, to be carried out in simple or varied phrases, in  counterpoint, or in a free manner, will certainly entail no headache on  Y.R.H., but rather, in finding yourself thus right amid the centre of art,  cause you very great pleasure. The faculty of representing precisely what  we wish and feel comes by degrees; an essential _desideratum_ for a  noble-minded man. My eyes warn me to conclude. With every kind and good  wish for Y.R.H., I remain, &c., &c.    [K.]    POSTSCRIPT.    If Y.R.H. should confer the happiness of a letter on me, I beg you will  address to me at Vienna, for I shall receive all my letters here safely  forwarded by the post from there. If agreeable to Y.R.H., I would beg you  to recommend the Mass to Prince Anton in Dresden,[6] so that the King of  Saxony may subscribe to it, which he will, no doubt, do if Y.R.H. shows any  interest in the matter. As soon as I know that you have actually done me  this favor, I will forthwith apply to the General-Director there[7] of the  Royal Theatre and of Music, whose office it is to arrange these things, and  send him a request to procure a subscription from the King of Saxony, which  I am reluctant to do without a recommendation from Y.R.H.    My opera, \"Fidelio,\" was performed with much applause in Dresden at the  festivities there in honor of the visit of the King of Bavaria, when their  Majesties were all present. I received this intelligence from the  above-named director-general, who asked me for the score through Weber, and  afterwards sent me really a very handsome present in return. I hope Y.R.H.  will excuse my intruding such a request on you, but Y.R.H. knows that I am  not usually importunate. Should, however, the slightest obstacle arise to  render my request disagreeable to you, I shall not be the less convinced of  your generosity and kindness. Neither avarice, nor the love of speculation,  which I have always avoided, prompted this scheme; but necessity compels me  to use every effort to rescue my self from my present condition. Candor is  best, for it will prevent my being too hardly judged. Owing to constant ill  health, which has prevented my writing as usual, I have incurred a debt of  200 to 300 florins C.M.,[8] which can only be discharged by vigorous  exertions on my part. If my subscription succeeds better than it has  hitherto done, it will be an effectual help, and if my health improves, of  which there is every hope, I shall be able once more to resume my  compositions with fresh energy. In the mean time I trust Y.R.H. will not be  offended by my candor. Had it not been the fear of being accused of not  sufficiently _bestirring_ myself, I would have persevered in my usual  silence. As to the recommendation, I am at all events convinced that Y.R.H.  is always glad to effect good results for others when _possible_, and that  you are not likely to make any exception in my case.

TO SCHINDLER.    Hetzendorf, July 1, 1823.    I am myself writing to Wocher [cabinet courier to Prince Esterhazy? No.  333], and for more speed I send by Carl, who chances to be driving in, the  application to Prince E. Be so good as to inquire the result; I doubt its  being favorable, not expecting much kindly feeling on his part towards me,  judging from former days.[1] I believe that female influence alone ensures  success with him in such matters; at all events, I now know, by your  obliging inquiries, how I can safely write to this Scholz. The bad weather,  and more especially the bad atmosphere, prevented my paying her [Countess  Schafgotsch] a visit about this affair.[2]    Your _amicus_,    BEETHOVEN.    P.S. Nothing yet from Dresden! Schlemmer [the copyist] has just been here  asking again for money. I have now advanced him 70 Gulden. Speculations are  for commercial men, and not for poor devils like myself. Hitherto the sole  fruit of this unlucky speculation [a subscription for his Mass] are only  more debts. You have, no doubt, seen that the \"Gloria\" is completed. If my  eyes were only strong again, so that I could resume my writing, I should do  well enough. [Written on the cover:] Are the Variations [Op. 120] sent off  yet to London? N.B.--So far as I can remember, it was not mentioned in the  application to Prince Esterhazy that the Mass was to be delivered in  manuscript only. What mischief may ensue from this! I suspect that such was  the intention of Herr Artaria in proposing to present the Mass _gratis_ to  the Prince, as it would give Artaria an opportunity for the third time to  steal one of my works. Wocher's attention must be called to this.    Of course, there is nothing obligatory on Papageno in the matter.    [Footnote 1: Beethoven wrote the Mass in C for him in the year 1807, which  was by no means satisfactory to the prince when performed at Eisenstadt in  the year following, and conducted by Beethoven himself.]    [Footnote 2: Scholz, music director at Warmbrunn in Silesia, had written a  German text for the Mass in C. Beethoven also wished to have from him a  German translation from the Latin words adapted to the music of the Grand  Mass. Schindler says, that the words \"prevented my visiting her\" refer to  Countess Schafgotsch, whom Beethoven wished to see on account of Scholz,  who unhappily died in the ensuing year. His text, however, is given in the  _Cecilia_, 23-54.]      338.

Although neither vain nor ambitious, still I consider it  advisable not wholly to pass over such an occurrence, as in practical life  we must live and work for others, who may often eventually benefit by it.
