[Footnote 1: A lecture delivered before the students of Sibley  College, Cornell University, December 4, 1891.--_The Crank_.]      It is not an easy matter to present a dry subject in such an  attractive form as to excite a thrilling interest in it, and military  science is no exception to this rule. An ingenious military instructor  at one of our universities has succeeded in pointing out certain  analogies between grand tactics and the festive game of football,  which appears to have greatly improved the football, if we may judge  from the recent victories of the blue over the red and the black and  orange, but it is not so clear that the effect of the union has been  very beneficial to military science; and even if such had been the  case, I fear there are no similar analogies that would be useful in  enlivening the subject of military engineering.    From the earliest times of which we have record man has been disposed  to strive with his fellow man, either to maintain his own rights or to  possess himself of some rights or material advantage enjoyed by  others. When one or only a few men encroach on the rights of others in  an organized community, they may be restrained by the legal machinery  of the state, such as courts, police, and prisons, but when a whole  community or state rises against another, the civil law becomes  powerless and a state of war ensues. It is not proposed here to  discuss the ethics of this question, nor the desirability of providing  a suitable court of nations for settling all international  difficulties without war. The great advantage of such a system of  avoiding war is admitted by all intelligent people. We notice here a  singular inconsistency in the principles upon which this strife is  carried on, viz.: If it be a single combat, either a friendly contest  or a deadly one, the parties are expected to contest on equal terms as  nearly as may be arranged; but if large numbers are engaged, or in  other words, when the contest becomes war, the rule is reversed and  each party is expected to take every possible advantage of his  adversary, even to the extent of stratagem or deception. In fact, it  has passed into a proverb that \"all things are fair in love and war.\"    Now one of the first things resorted to, in order to gain an advantage  over the enemy, was to bring in material appliances, such as walls,  ditches, catapults, scaling ladders, battering rams, and subsequently  the more modern appliances, such as guns, forts, and torpedoes, all of  which are known as engines of war, and the men who built and operated  these engines were very naturally called engineers. It is this kind of  an artificer that Shakespeare refers to when he playfully suggests  that \"'tis the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard.\"    The early military engineer has left ample records and monuments of  his genius. The walls of ancient cities, castles that still crown many  hills in both hemispheres, the great Chinese wall, the historical  bridge of Julius Caesar, which with charming simplicity he tells us was  built because it did not comport with his dignity to cross the stream  in boats, the bridge of boats across the Hellespont, by Xerxes, are  all examples of early military engineering. The Bible tells us \"King  Uzziah built towers at the gates of Jerusalem, and at the turning of  the wall, and fortified them.\" We may note in passing that the  buttresses, battlements, and bartizans with which our modern  architects ornament or disfigure churches, peaceful dwellings, and  public buildings, are copied from the early works of the military  engineer.    Coming down to the military engineers of our own country, we find that  one of the first acts of the Continental Congress, after appointing  Washington as commander-in-chief, was to authorize him to employ a  number of engineers. It was not, however, until 1777 that a number of  engineer officers from the French army arrived in this country, and  were appointed in the Continental army. General DuPortail was made  Chief Engineer, and Colonel Kosciusko, the great Polish patriot, was  among his assistants. Other officers of the Continental army were  employed on engineering duty; and under their supervision such works  as the forts and the great chain barrier at West Point were built, and  the siege operations around Boston and Yorktown were carried on.    After the close of the war, in 1794, a Corps of \"Artillerists and  Engineers\" was organized. This corps was stationed at West Point, and  became the nucleus of the United States Military Academy. In 1802, by  operation of the law reorganizing the army, this corps was divided, as  the names would indicate, into an Artillery Corps and Corps of  Engineers. The Corps of Engineers consisted of one major, two  captains, four lieutenants, and ten cadets. The Artillery Corps was  again divided into the Ordnance Corps and several regiments of  artillery, now five in number, while the duties of the Corps of  Engineers were divided between the Engineer Corps and a Corps of  Topographical Engineers, organized at a later date; but on the  breaking out of the late rebellion it was deemed best to unite the two  corps, and they have so remained until the present time. The Corps of  Engineers now consists of 118 officers of various grades, from second  lieutenant to brigadier general, of which last grade there is only one  officer, the chief of the corps, and it requires something more than  an average official lifetime for the aforesaid lieutenant to attain  that rank. Hardly one in ten of them ever reach it. Daniel Webster's  remark to the young lawyer, that \"there is always room at the top,\"  will not apply to the Corps of Engineers. The officers are all  graduates of the Military Academy, which institution continued as a  part of the Corps of Engineers until 1866. The vacancies in the corps  are filled by the assignment to it of from two to six graduates each  year, and there is attached to the corps a battalion of four companies  of enlisted men, formerly called Sappers and Miners, but now known as  the Battalion of Engineers.    We now come naturally to the duties of our military engineer, and here  I may remark that these duties are so varied and so numerous that a  detailed recital of them would suggest Goldsmith's \"Deserted Village:\"          ... \"And still the wonder grew        That one small head could carry all he _ought to know_\"    [Never lose sight of fact for the sake of rhyme.]    In general terms, his duties consist of:        1. Military surveys and explorations.        2. Boundary surveys.        3. Geodetic and hydrographic survey of the great lakes.        4. Building fortifications--both permanent works and temporary      or field works.        5. Constructing military roads.        6. Pontoniering or building military bridges, both with the      regular bridge trains and with improved materials.        7. The planning and directing of siege operations, either      offensive or defensive; sapping, mining, etc.        8. Providing, testing and planting torpedoes for harbor      defense when operating from shore stations.        9. Staff duty with general officers.        10. Improving rivers and harbors.        11. The building and repairing of lighthouses.        12. Various special duties as commissioner of District of      Columbia, superintendent military academy, commandant engineer      school, instructors at both of these schools, attaches to      several foreign legations, for the collection of military      information, etc.    It would, of course, exceed the proper limits of a single lecture to  go into the details of these many duties, but we may take only a  passing glance at most of them, and give more special attention to a  few that may involve some points of interest. Perhaps the most  interesting branch of the subject would be that of permanent  fortifications, or what amounts to almost the same thing in this  country, sea coast defenses. And here our trouble begins, for, while  civil engineers have constant experience to guide them, their roads,  bridges, and other structures being in constant use, the military  engineer has only now and then, at long intervals, a war or a siege of  sufficient extent to furnish data upon which he can safely plan or  build his structures. Imagine a civil engineer designing a bridge,  road, or a dam to meet some possible future demand, without having  seen such a structure used for twenty years or more, and you can form  some estimate of the delightful uncertainties that surround the  military engineer when called upon to design a modern fort. The  proving ground shows him that radical improvements are necessary, but  actual service conditions are almost entirely wanting, and such as we  have contradict many of the proving ground theories. Thus we have the  records of shot going through 25 inches of iron or 25 feet of concrete  on the proving ground; but such actual service tests as the  bombardment of Fort Sumter, Fort Fisher, and the forts at Alexandria  contradict this entirely, and indicate that, except for the moral  effect, our old forts, with modern guns in them and some additional  strengthening at their weaker points, would answer all purposes so far  as bombardment from fleets is concerned. This is not saying that the  forts are good enough in their present condition, but simply that they  can readily be made far superior in strength, both offensive and  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15207"],[0,"The New Physics and Its Evolution (#16)"],[1,"that which  proceeds from them.    Thus atomism, which is, perhaps, only an appearance containing even  some contradictions, is yet a well-founded appearance, since it  conforms to the laws of our minds; and this hypothesis is, in a way,  necessary.    We may dispute the conclusions of M. Hannequin, but no one will refuse  to recognise, as he does, that atomic theories occupy a preponderating  part in the doctrines of physics; and the position which they have  thus conquered gives them, in a way, the right of saying that they  rest on a real principle. It is in order to recognise this right that  several physicists--M. Langevin, for example--ask that atoms be  promoted from the rank of hypotheses to that of principles. By this  they mean that the atomistic ideas forced upon us by an almost  obligatory induction based on very exact experiments, enable us to  co-ordinate a considerable amount of facts, to construct a very general  synthesis, and to foresee a great number of phenomena.    It is of moment, moreover, to thoroughly understand that atomism does  not necessarily set up the hypothesis of centres of attraction acting  at a distance, and it must not be confused with molecular physics,  which has, on the other hand, undergone very serious checks. The  molecular physics greatly in favour some fifty years ago leads to such  complex representations and to solutions often so undetermined, that  the most courageous are wearied with upholding it and it has fallen  into some discredit. It rested on the fundamental principles of  mechanics applied to molecular actions; and that was, no doubt, an  extension legitimate enough, since mechanics is itself only an  experimental science, and its principles, established for the  movements of matter taken as a whole, should not be applied outside  the domain which belongs to them. Atomism, in fact, tends more and  more, in modern theories, to imitate the principle of the conservation  of energy or that of entropy, to disengage itself from the artificial  bonds which attached it to mechanics, and to put itself forward as an  independent principle.    Atomistic ideas also have undergone evolution, and this slow evolution  has been considerably quickened under the influence of modern  discoveries. These reach back to the most remote antiquity, and to  follow their development we should have to write the history of human  thought which they have always accompanied since the time of  Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius. The first observers  who noticed that the volume of a body could be diminished by  compression or cold, or augmented by heat, and who saw a soluble solid  body mix completely with the water which dissolved it, must have been  compelled to suppose that matter was not dispersed continuously  throughout the space it seemed to occupy. They were thus brought to  consider it discontinuous, and to admit that a substance having the  same composition and the same properties in all its parts--in a word,  perfectly homogeneous--ceases to present this homogeneity when  considered within a sufficiently small volume.    Modern experimenters have succeeded by direct experiments in placing  in evidence this heterogeneous character of matter when taken in small  mass. Thus, for example, the superficial tension, which is constant  for the same liquid at a given temperature, no longer has the same  value when the thickness of the layer of liquid becomes extremely  small. Newton noticed even in his time that a dark zone is seen to  form on a soap bubble at the moment when it becomes so thin that it  must burst. Professor Reinold and Sir Arthur Ruecker have shown that  this zone is no longer exactly spherical; and from this we must  conclude that the superficial tension, constant for all thicknesses  above a certain limit, commences to vary when the thickness falls  below a critical value, which these authors estimate, on optical  grounds, at about fifty millionths of a millimetre.    From experiments on capillarity, Prof. Quincke has obtained similar  results with regard to layers of solids. But it is not only capillary  properties which allow this characteristic to be revealed. All the  properties of a body are modified when taken in small mass; M. Meslin  proves this in a very ingenious way as regards optical properties, and  Mr Vincent in respect of electric conductivity. M. Houllevigue, who,  in a chapter of his excellent work, _Du Laboratoire a l'Usine_, has  very clearly set forth the most interesting considerations on atomic  hypotheses, has recently demonstrated that copper and silver cease to  combine with iodine as soon as they are present in a thickness of less  than thirty millionths of a millimetre. It is this same dimension  likewise that is possessed, according to M. Wiener, by the smallest  thicknesses it is possible to deposit on glass. These layers are so  thin that they cannot be perceived, but their presence is revealed by  a change in the properties of the light reflected by them.    Thus, below fifty to thirty millionths of a millimetre the properties  of matter depend on its thickness. There are then, no doubt, only a  few molecules to be met with, and it may be concluded, in consequence,  that the discontinuous elements of bodies--that is, the molecules--  have linear dimensions of the order of magnitude of the millionth of a  millimetre. Considerations regarding more complex phenomena, for  instance the phenomena of electricity by contact, and also the kinetic  theory of gases, bring us to the same conclusion.    The idea of the discontinuity of matter forces itself upon us for many  other reasons. All modern chemistry is founded on this principle; and  laws like the law of multiple proportions, introduce an evident  discontinuity to which we find analogies in the law of electrolysis.  The elements of bodies we are thus brought to regard might, as regards  solids at all events, be considered as immobile; but this immobility  could not explain the phenomena of heat, and, as it is entirely  inadmissible for gases, it seems very improbable it can absolutely  occur in any state. We are thus led to suppose that these elements are  animated by very complicated movements, each one proceeding in closed  trajectories in which the least variations of temperature or pressure  cause modifications.    The atomistic hypothesis shows itself remarkably fecund in the study  of phenomena produced in gases, and here the mutual independence of  the particles renders the question relatively more simple and,  perhaps, allows the principles of mechanics to be more certainly  extended to the movements of molecules.    The kinetic theory of gases can point to unquestioned successes; and  the idea of Daniel Bernouilli, who, as early as 1738, considered a  gaseous mass to be formed of a considerable number of molecules  animated by rapid movements of translation, has been put into a form  precise enough for mathematical analysis, and we have thus found  ourselves in a position to construct a really solid foundation. It  will be at once conceived, on this hypothesis, that pressure is the  resultant of the shocks of the molecules against the walls of the  containing vessel, and we at once come to the demonstration that the  law of Mariotte is a natural consequence of this origin of pressure;  since, if the volume occupied by a certain number of molecules is  doubled, the number of shocks per second on each square centimetre of  the walls becomes half as much. But if we attempt to carry this  further, we find ourselves in presence of a serious difficulty. It is  impossible to mentally follow every one of the many individual  molecules which compose even a very limited mass of gas. The path  followed by this molecule may be every instant modified by the chance  of running against another, or by a shock which may make it rebound in  another direction.    The difficulty would be insoluble if chance had not laws of its own.  It was Maxwell who first thought of introducing into the kinetic  theory the calculation of probabilities. Willard Gibbs and Boltzmann  later on developed this idea, and have founded a statistical method  which does not, perhaps, give absolute certainty, but which is  certainly most interesting and curious. Molecules are grouped in such  a way that those belonging to the same group may be considered as  having the same state of movement; then an examination is made of the  number of molecules in each group, and what are the changes in this  number from one moment to another. It is thus often possible to  determine the part which the different groups have in the total  properties of the system and in the phenomena which may occur.    Such a method, analogous to the one employed by statisticians for  following the social phenomena in a population, is all the more  legitimate the greater the number of individuals counted in the  averages; now, the number of molecules contained in a limited space--  for example, in a centimetre cube taken in normal conditions--is such  that no population could ever attain so high a figure. All  considerations, those we have indicated as well as others which might  be invoked (for example, the recent researches of M. Spring on the  limit of visibility of fluorescence), give this result:--that there  are, in this space, some twenty thousand millions of molecules. Each  of these must receive in the space of a millimetre about ten thousand  shocks, and be ten thousand times thrust out of its course. The free  path of a molecule is then very small, but it can be singularly  augmented by diminishing the number of them. Tait and Dewar have  calculated that, in a good modern vacuum, the length of the free path  of the remaining molecules not taken away by the air-pump easily  reaches a few centimetres.    By developing this theory, we come to consider that, for a given  temperature, every molecule (and even every individual"]]]
