The train had stopped and started again and, as it gained headway  and greater distance, Tarzan could tell from the direction of the  sound that it was moving south.    The ape-man followed the trail to the railway where it ended  abruptly on the west side of the track, showing that the girl had  boarded the train, just as he thought. There was nothing now but  to follow on to Wilhelmstal, where he hoped to find Captain Fritz  Schneider, as well as the girl, and to recover his diamond-studded  locket.    It was dark when Tarzan reached the little hill town of Wilhelmstal.  He loitered on the outskirts, getting his bearings and trying to  determine how an almost naked white man might explore the village  without arousing suspicion. There were many soldiers about and  the town was under guard, for he could see a lone sentinel walking  his post scarce a hundred yards from him. To elude this one would  not be difficult; but to enter the village and search it would be  practically impossible, garbed, or un-garbed, as he was.    Creeping forward, taking advantage of every cover, lying flat and  motionless when the sentry's face was toward him, the ape-man at  last reached the sheltering shadows of an outhouse just inside the  lines. From there he moved stealthily from building to building  until at last he was discovered by a large dog in the rear of one of  the bungalows. The brute came slowly toward him, growling. Tarzan  stood motionless beside a tree. He could see a light in the bungalow  and uniformed men moving about and he hoped that the dog would not  bark. He did not; but he growled more savagely and, just at the  moment that the rear door of the bungalow opened and a man stepped  out, the animal charged.    He was a large dog, as large as Dango, the hyena, and he charged  with all the vicious impetuosity of Numa, the lion.  As he came  Tarzan knelt and the dog shot through the air for his throat; but  he was dealing with no man now and he found his quickness more  than matched by the quickness of the Tarmangani. His teeth never  reached the soft flesh--strong fingers, fingers of steel, seized  his neck. He voiced a single startled yelp and clawed at the naked  breast before him with his talons; but he was powerless. The mighty  fingers closed upon his throat; the man rose, snapped the clawing  body once, and cast it aside. At the same time a voice from the  open bungalow door called: \"Simba!\"    There was no response. Repeating the call the man descended the  steps and advanced toward the tree. In the light from the doorway  Tarzan could see that he was a tall, broad-shouldered man in the  uniform of a German officer. The ape-man withdrew into the shadow  of the tree's stem. The man came closer, still calling the dog--he  did not see the savage beast, crouching now in the shadow, awaiting  him. When he had approached within ten feet of the Tarmangani,  Tarzan leaped upon him--as Sabor springs to the kill, so sprang the  ape-man. The momentum and weight of his body hurled the German to  the ground, powerful fingers prevented an outcry and, though the  officer struggled, he had no chance and a moment later lay dead  beside the body of the dog.    As Tarzan stood for a moment looking down upon his kill and regretting  that he could not risk voicing his beloved victory cry, the sight  of the uniform suggested a means whereby he might pass to and  fro through Wilhelmstal with the minimum chance of detection. Ten  minutes later a tall, broad-shouldered officer stepped from the  yard of the bungalow leaving behind him the corpses of a dog and  a naked man.    He walked boldly along the little street and those who passed him  could not guess that beneath Imperial Germany's uniform beat a  savage heart that pulsed with implacable hatred for the Hun. Tarzan's  first concern was to locate the hotel, for here he guessed he would  find the girl, and where the girl was doubtless would be Hauptmann  Fritz Schneider, who was either her confederate, her sweetheart,  or both, and there, too, would be Tarzan's precious locket.    He found the hotel at last, a low, two-storied building with  a veranda. There were lights on both floors and people, mostly  officers, could be seen within. The ape-man considered entering  and inquiring for those he sought; but his better judgment finally  prompted him to reconnoiter first. Passing around the building he  looked into all the lighted rooms on the first floor and, seeing  neither of those for whom he had come, he swung lightly to the roof  of the veranda and continued his investigations through windows of  the second story.    At one corner of the hotel in a rear room the blinds were drawn;  but he heard voices within and once he saw a figure silhouetted  momentarily against the blind. It appeared to be the figure  of a woman; but it was gone so quickly that he could not be sure.  Tarzan crept close to the window and listened.  Yes, there was a  woman there and a man--he heard distinctly the tones of their voices  although he could overhear no words, as they seemed to be whispering.    The adjoining room was dark. Tarzan tried the window and found it  unlatched. All was quiet within. He raised the sash and listened  again--still silence. Placing a leg over the sill he slipped within  and hurriedly glanced about. The room was vacant. Crossing to the  door he opened it and looked out into the hall. There was no one  there, either, and he stepped out and approached the door of the  adjoining room where the man and woman were.    Pressing close to the door he listened. Now he distinguished  words, for the two had raised their voices as though in argument.  The woman was speaking.    \"I have brought the locket,\" she said, \"as was agreed upon between  you and General Kraut, as my identification. I carry no other  credentials. This was to be enough. You have nothing to do but give  me the papers and let me go.\"    The man replied in so low a tone that Tarzan could not catch the  words and then the woman spoke again--a note of scorn and perhaps  a little of fear in her voice.    \"You would not dare, Hauptmann Schneider,\" she said, and then: \"Do  not touch me! Take your hands from me!\"    It was then that Tarzan of the Apes opened the door and stepped  into the room. What he saw was a huge, bull-necked German officer  with one arm about the waist of Fraulein Bertha Kircher and a hand  upon her forehead pushing her head back as he tried to kiss her  on the mouth. The girl was struggling against the great brute; but  her efforts were futile.  Slowly the man's lips were coming closer  to hers and slowly, step by step, she was being carried backward.    Schneider heard the noise of the opening and closing door behind  him and turned. At sight of this strange officer he dropped the  girl and straightened up.    \"What is the meaning of this intrusion, Lieutenant?\" he demanded,  noting the other's epaulettes. \"Leave the room at once.\"    Tarzan made no articulate reply; but the two there with him heard  a low growl break from those firm lips--a growl that sent a shudder  through the frame of the girl and brought a pallor to the red face  of the Hun and his hand to his pistol but even as he drew his weapon  it was wrested from him and hurled through the blind and window to  the yard beyond.  Then Tarzan backed against the door and slowly  removed the uniform coat.    \"You are Hauptmann Schneider,\" he said to the German.    \"What of it?\" growled the latter.    \"I am Tarzan of the Apes,\" replied the ape-man. \"Now you know why  I intrude.\"    The two before him saw that he was naked beneath the coat which he  threw upon the floor and then he slipped quickly from the trousers  and stood there clothed only in his loin cloth.  The girl had  recognized him by this time, too.    \"Take your hand off that pistol,\" Tarzan admonished her.  Her hand  dropped at her side. \"Now come here!\"    She approached and Tarzan removed the weapon and hurled it after  the other. At the mention of his name Tarzan had noted the sickly  pallor that overspread the features of the Hun. At last he had found  the right man. At last his mate would be partially avenged--never  could she be entirely avenged. Life was too short and there were  too many Germans.    \"What do you want of me?\" demanded Schneider.    \"You are going to pay the price for the thing you did at the little  bungalow in the Waziri country,\" replied the ape-man.    Schneider commenced to bluster and threaten. Tarzan turned the key  in the lock of the door and hurled the former through the window  after the pistols. Then he turned to the girl. \"Keep out of the  way,\" he said in a low voice. \"Tarzan of the Apes is going to kill.\"    The Hun ceased blustering and began to plead. \"I have a wife and  children at home,\" he cried. \"I have done nothing, I--\"    \"You are going to die as befits your kind,\" said Tarzan, \"with blood  on your hands and a lie on your lips.\" He started across the room  toward the burly Hauptmann. Schneider was a large and powerful  man--about the height of the ape-man but much heavier. He saw that  neither threats nor pleas would avail him and so he prepared to  fight as a cornered rat fights for its life with all the maniacal  rage, cunning, and ferocity that the first law of nature imparts  to many beasts.    Lowering his bull head he charged for the ape-man and in the center  of the floor the two clinched. There they stood locked and swaying  for a moment until Tarzan succeeded in forcing his antagonist backward  over a table which crashed to the floor, splintered by the weight  of the two heavy bodies.    The girl stood watching the battle with wide eyes. She saw the two  men rolling hither and thither across the floor and she heard with  horror the low growls that came from the lips of the naked giant.  Schneider was trying to reach his foe's throat with his fingers  while,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14012"],[0,"Ice-Caves of France and Switzerland (#16)"],[1,"e, he has to saw off the bottom  layer. Madame Briot said I was right in supposing March to be the great  time for the formation of ice, as she had heard her husband say that the  columns were higher then than at any other time of the year: she also  confirmed my views as to the disastrous effects of heavy rain. As with  every other glaciere of which I could obtain any account, excepting the  Lower Glaciere of the Pre de S. Livres, she complained that the ice had  not been so beautiful and so abundant this year as last, although the  winter had been exceptionally severe.

The Paris correspondent of the 'Times'  gave, some months since (see the impression of Jan. 20, 1865), an  account of an interesting trial respecting the manufacture of the  liqueur peculiar to the Abbey of Grace-Dieu. From this account it  appears that the liqueur was formerly called the Liqueur of the  Grace-Dieu, but is now known as Trappistine. It is limpid and oily;  possesses a fine aroma, a peculiar softness, a mild but brisk flavour,  and so on. It was invented by an ecclesiastic who was once the Brother  Marie-Joseph, and prior of the convent, but is now M. Stremler, having  been released by the Pope from his vows of obedience and poverty, in  order that he might teach Christianity to the infidels of the New World.  The Brothers took the question of the renunciation of poverty into their  own hands, by declining to give up the money which Brother Marie-Joseph  had originally brought into the society; so M. Stremler, being now  moneyless, commenced the secular manufacture of the seductive  Trappistine, in opposition to the regular manufacture within the walls  of the Abbey, abstaining, however, from the use of the religious label  which is the Brothers' trade-mark. The unfortunate inventor was fined  and condemned in costs for his piracy.]    [Footnote 36: See p. 310.]    [Footnote 37: _Journal des Mines_, Prairial, an iv., pp. 65, &c.]             *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VI.    BESANCON AND DOLE.      The afternoon was so far advanced when I returned to the convent, that  it was clearly impossible to reach Besancon at five o'clock, and  consequently there was time to inspect the Brothers and their buildings.  The field near the convent was gay with haymakers; and the brown monks,  with here and there a priest in _ci-devant_ white, moved among the hired  labourers, and stirred them up by exhortation and example,--with this  difference, that while it was evidently the business of the monks so to  do, the priests, on the other hand, had only taken fork in hand for the  sake of a little gentle exercise. One unhappy Jacques Bonhomme made hot  and toilsome hay in thick brown clothes, plainly manufactured from a  defunct Brother's gown; for, to judge from appearances, a cast-off gown  is a thing unknown. It was good to see a Brother, in horn spectacles of  mediaeval cut, tenderly chopping a log for firewood, and peering at it  through his spectacles after each stroke, as a man examines some  delicate piece of natural machinery with a microscope; to see another  Brother, the sphere of whose duties lay in the flour-mill, standing in  the doorway with brown robe and shaven crown all powdered alike with  white, and a third covered from head to foot with sawdust; or, best of  all, to see an antique Brother, with scarecrow legs, and low shoes which  had presumably been in his possession or that of his predecessors for a  long series of years, wheeling a barrow of liquid manure, with his gown  looped up high by means of stout whipcord and an arrangement of large  brass rings. The Brother whose business it was to do such cooking as  might be required by visitors, grinned in the most friendly and  engaging manner from ear to ear when he was looked at; and, by fixing  him steadily with the eye, he could be kept for considerable spaces of  time standing in the middle of the kitchen, knife in hand, with the  corners of his mouth out of sight round his broad cheeks. His ample  front was decked with a blue apron, suspended from his shoulders, and  confined round the convexity of his waist by an old strap which no  respectable costermonger would have used as harness. The soup served was  by courtesy called _soupe maigre,_ but it was in fact _soupe maigre_  diluted by many homoeopathic myriads, and the Brother showed much  curiosity as to my opinion of its taste--a curiosity which I could not  satisfy without hurting his professional pride. When that course was  finished, the large-faced cook suggested an omelette, as the most  substantial thing allowed on eves, proceeding to draw the materials from  a closet which so fully shared in the general abstinence from water as a  means of cleansing, that I shut my eyes upon all further operations, and  ate the eventual omelette in faith. Its excellence called forth such  hearty commendations, that there seemed to be some danger of the mouth  not coming right again. Then salads, and bread and butter, and wine, and  various kinds of cheese were brought, which made in all a very fair  dinner for a fast-day.    The culinary monk knew nothing of the history of his convent, beyond the  bare year of its foundation, and displayed a monotonous dead level of  ignorance on all topographical and historical questions: to him the  _Pain d'Abbaye_[38] meant nothing further than the staff of life there  provided, and he neither knew himself nor could recommend any Brother  who knew anything about the glaciere. He was a German, and we talked of  his native Baiern and the modern glories of his capital; and when his  questions elicited a declaration of my profession, he passed up to  Saxony, and pinned me with Luther. Finding that I objected to being so  pinned, and repudiated something of that which his charge involved, he  waived Luther, of whom he knew nothing beyond his name, and came down  upon me triumphantly with the word Protestant. I explained to him, of  course, that the worthy Elector, and his friends who protested, had not  much to do with the Anglican branch of the Church Catholic; and then the  old task had to be gone through of assuring the assembled Brothers that  we in England have Sacraments, have Orders, have a Trinitarian Creed.    At length, about half-past three, we started for Besancon, paying of  course _a volonte_ for food and entertainment, as we did not choose to  qualify as paupers. The driver told me on the way that there was another  glaciere at Vaise, a village three or four kilometres from Besancon, and  at no great distance from the road by which we should approach the town;  so, when we reached the crest above Morre, where the road passes the  final ridge by means of a tunnel, I paid the carriage off, and walked to  the village of Vaise. The public-house knew of the glaciere--knew indeed  of two,--further still, kept the keys of both. This was good news,  though the idea of keys in connection with an ice-cave was rather  strange; and I proposed to organise an expedition at once to the  glacieres. The male half of the auberge declared that he was forbidden  to open them to strangers, except by special order from a certain  monsieur in Besancon; but the female half, scenting centimes, stated her  belief that the monsieur in Besancon could never wish them to turn away  a stranger who had come so many kilometres through the dust to see the  ice. She put the proposed disobedience in so persuasive and Christian a  form, that I was obliged to take the husband's side,--not that he was in  any need of support, for he had been longer married than Adam was, and  showed no signs of giving way. It turned out, after all, that though  there was no doubt about the existence of the glacieres, there was  equally no doubt that they were _glacieres artificielles_, being simply  ice-houses dug in the side of a hill, and the property of a _glacier_ in  Besancon; so that my friend the driver had sent me to a mare's-nest.    The pathway across the hills to Besancon was rather intricate, and by  good fortune an old Frenchman appeared, who was returning from his work  at a neighbouring church, and served as companion and guide. He had bid  farewell to sixty some years before, and, being a builder, had been  going up and down a ladder all day, with full and empty _hottes_, to an  extent which outdid the Shanars of missionary meetings; and yet he  walked faster than any foreigner of my experience. He talked in due  proportion, and told some interesting details of the bombardment of  Besancon, which he"]]]
