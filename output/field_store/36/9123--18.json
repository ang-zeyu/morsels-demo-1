At this period Najib, as minister in charge of the metropolis and  its immediate dependencies, though skilfully contending against  many obstacles, yet had not succeeded in consolidating the empire  so much as to render restoration a very desirable object to an  Emperor living in ease and security. Scarcely had the premier  been freed from the menace of the Eastern Jats by his own prowess  and by their subsequent troubles, than their kindred of the  Panjab began to threaten Dehli from the west. Fortunately for the  minister, his old patron, the Abdali, was able to come to his  assistance; and in April, 1767, having defeated the Sikhs in  several actions, Ahmad once more appeared in the neighbourhood of  Panipat, at the head of 50,000 Afghan horse.    He seems to have been well satisfied with the result of the  arrangements that he had made after crushing the Mahrattas in the  same place six years before; only that he wrote a sharp reprimand  to Shujaa-ud-daulah for his conduct towards the Emperor. But  this, however well deserved, would not produce much effect on  that graceless politician, when once the Afghan had returned to  his own country. This he soon after did, and appeared no more on  the troubled scene of Hindustan.    Profiting by the disappearance of their enemy, the Mahrattas,  having arranged their intestine disputes, crossed the Chambal (a  river flowing eastward into the Jamna from the Ajmir plateau),  and fell upon the Jaipur country towards the end of 1768. Hence  they passed into Bhartpur, where they exacted tribute, and whence  they threatened Dehli in 1769. Among their leaders were two of  whom much will be seen hereafter. One was Madhoji Sindhia\"Patel\"  the other was Takuji Holkar. The first of these was the natural  son of Ranoji Sindhia, and inherited, with his father's power,  the animosity which that chief had always felt against Najib and  the Rohillas. The other was a leader in the army of Malhar Rao  Holkar (who had lately died), and, like his master, was friendly  to the Pathans. Thus, with the hereditary rivalry of their  respective clans, these foremost men of the Mahratta army  combined a traditional difference of policy, which was destined  to paralyze the Mahratta proceedings, not only in this, but in  many subsequent campaigns.    1770.  Aided by Holkar, the Dehli Government entered into an  accommodation with the invaders, in which the Jats were  sacrificed, and the Rohillas were shortly after induced by  Najib-ud-daulah to enter into negotiations. These led to the  surrender to the Mahrattas of the Central Doab, between the  provinces held by the Emperor to the eastward, and the more  immediate territories administered in his name from Dehli. These  latter tracts were spared in pursuance of the negotiations with  the Emperor which were still pending.    Soon after these transactions the prudent and virtuous minister  died, and was succeeded in his post by his son, Zabita Khan. It  is not necessary to enlarge upon the upright and faithful  character of Najib-ud-daulah, which has been sufficiently obvious  in the course of our narrative, as have also his skill and  courage. It would have been well for the empire had his posterity  inherited the former qualities. Had Zabita, for instance,  followed in his father's steps, and had the Emperor at the same  time been a man of more decision, it was perhaps even then  possible for a restoration to have taken place, in which, backed  by the power of Rohilkand, and on friendly terms with the  British, the Court of Dehli might have played off Holkar against  Sindhia, and shaken off all the irksome consequences of a  Mahratta Protectorate.    The preceding record shows how superior Najib-ud-daulah's  character and genius were to those of the native Hindustani  nobles. It may be interesting to see how he impressed a European  contemporary, who had excellent opportunities of judging:    \"He is the only example in Hindustan of, at once, a great and a  good character. He raised himself from the command of fifty horse  to his present grandeur entirely by his superior valour,  integrity, and strength of mind. Experience and abilities have  supplied the want of letters and education, and the native  nobleness and goodness of his heart have amply made amends for  the defect of his birth and family. He is now about sixty years  of age, borne down by fatigue and sickness.\"  (Mr. Verelst, to  the Court of Directors, March 28th, 1768, ap. Mill.)    Since this prominent mention has been made of the Rohillas, and  since they are now for a short time to play a yet more  conspicuous part in the fortunes of the falling empire, it will  be well to give a brief description of their situation at the  time.    It has been seen how Ali Mohammad rose in the reign of Mohammad  Shah, and had been removed from Rohilkand by the aid of Safdar  Jang, the Viceroy of Audh. On the latter falling into disgrace,  Ali Mohammad returned to his native province about A.D. 1746. In  the next two or three years he continued successfully to  administer the affairs of the fair and fertile tract, but,  unfortunately for his family, died before his heirs were capable  of acting for themselves. Two relations of the deceased chief  acted as regents  Dundi Khan, the early patron of Najib, and  Rahmat Khan, known in India by the title of Hafiz, or  \"Protector.\" Safdar Jang continued to pursue them with relentless  purpose; and although the important aid of Ahmad, their foreign  fellow-clansman, and the necessity of combining against the  Mahrattas, prevented the Audh Viceroy's hostility from taking any  very active form, yet there can be no doubt but that he  bequeathed it to his successor, Shujaa, along with many other  unscrupulous designs. The Rohilla Pathans, for their part, were  as a race determined fighters, but generally false, fickle, and  dissolute.    In 1753 the elder son of Ali Mohammad had made an attempt to  remove the Protector and his colleague from their post. It was  not successful, and its only result was to sow dissensions among  the Rohillas, which caused their final ruin. In 1761, however,  they bore a part in the temporary overthrow of the Mahrattas at  Panipat; and during the next seven years the Rohilla power had  passed the frontier of the Ganges, and overflowed the Central  Doab, while the Najibabad family (who had a less close connection  with local politics, but were powerful kinsmen and allies) had  possession of the Upper Doab, up to the Siwalik Hills, above  Saharanpur. Nevertheless, this seeming good fortune was neither  permanent nor real.    In 1769, as we have just seen, Najib, though well disposed, was  unable to prevent the Central Doab from passing under the  Mahratta sway, and he died soon after its occupation occurred.  Dundi Khan also passed away about the same time; and the  Protector Rahmat was left alone in the decline of his  ever-darkening days, to maintain, as best he might, an usurped  authority menaced by a multitude of foes.    Zabita Khan, the son and successor of the late minister, and  himself an Afghan or Pathan by race, did nevertheless for a time  contribute to the resources of the Protector, his co-religionist  and quasi countryman.    He may, therefore, be reckoned amongst the Rohillas at this  period; and, as far as extent of territory went, he might have  been an ally of some importance. But territory in imbecile hands  and with foes like the Mahrattas was anything but a source of  strength. While these indefatigable freebooters spread themselves  over the whole Upper and Central Doab, and occupied all Rohilkand   excepting the small territory of Farakhabad, to the south of  the latter and north of the former  Zabita khan, instead of  endeavouring to prepare for the storm, occupied himself in  irritating the Emperor, by withholding the tribute due at  Allahabad, and by violating the sanctity of the Imperial zenana  at Dehli by intrigues with the Begams.    Thus passed the winter of 1770-71, at the end of which the  Mahrattas swarmed into the Doab, and occupied the metropolis;  only respecting the palace, where the Prince Regent and the  Imperial family continued to reside. Zabita, having organized no  plan, could offer no resistance, and escaped towards his  northward possessions.    By the connivance of his hereditary ally, Takuji Holkar (as Grant  Duff supposes), he left the field open for the Deccani marauders  to treat directly with Shah Alam for his restoration to the  throne of his father.        NOTE.  The authority chiefly followed in the portion of this  chapter that relates to Rohilla affairs, has been Hamilton's  \"History of the Rohillas,\" a valuable collection of  contemporaneous memoirs, although not always quite impartial.  Captain Grant Duff's research and fairness are beyond all praise,  wherever transactions of the Mahrattas are concerned. The sketch  of Jat politics is derived from the Siar-ul-Mutakharin and the  Tarikh-i-Mozafari; but it is as well to state, once for all that  the native chroniclers seldom present anything like complete  materials for history. A credulous and uncritical record of  gossip combined with a very scanty analysis of character and  motive characterizes their works, which are rather a set of  highly-coloured pictures without proportion or perspective, than  those orderly annals from which history elsewhere has chiefly  been compiled.

[Sensation.]    The conclusion of all is, that we must restore the Missouri Compromise.  We must highly resolve that _Kansas must be free_! [Great applause.] We  must reinstate the birthday promise of the Republic; we must reaffirm  the Declaration of Independence; we must make good in essence as well as  in form Madison's vowal that \"the word _slave_ ought not to appear in  the Constitution;\" and we must even go further, and decree that only  local law, and not that time-honoured instrument, shall shelter a  slave-holder. We must make this a land of liberty in fact, as it is in  name. But in seeking to attain these results--so indispensable if the  liberty which is our pride and boast shall endure--we will be loyal to  the Constitution and to the \"flag of our Union,\" and no matter what our  grievance--even though Kansas shall come in as a slave State; and no  matter what theirs--even if we shall restore the Compromise--WE WILL SAY  TO THE SOUTHERN DISUNIONISTS, WE WON'T GO OUT OF THE UNION, AND YOU  SHAN'T!!! [This was the climax; the audience rose to its feet _en  masse_, applauded, stamped, waved handkerchiefs, threw hats in the air,  and ran riot for several minutes. The arch-enchanter who wrought this  transformation looked, meanwhile, like the personification of political  justice.]    But let us, meanwhile, appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people,  and not to their prejudices; let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here  aroused all over these vast prairies, so suggestive of freedom. Let us  commence by electing the gallant soldier Governor (Colonel) Bissell who  stood for the honour of our State alike on the plains and amidst the  chaparral of Mexico and on the floor of Congress, while he defied the  Southern Hotspur; and that will have a greater moral effect than all the  border ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on Kansas. There is  both a power and a magic in popular opinion. To that let us now appeal;  and while, in all probability, no resort to force will be needed, our  moderation and forbearance will stand us in good stead when, if ever, WE  MUST MAKE AN APPEAL TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF HOSTS!! [Immense  applause and a rush for the orator.]    This speech has been called Lincoln's \"Lost Speech,\" because all the  reporters present were so carried away by his eloquence that they one  and all forgot to take any notes. If it had not been for a young lawyer,  a Mr. H.C. Whitney, who kept his head sufficiently to take notes, we  would have no record of it. Mr. Whitney wrote out the speech for  McClure's Magazine in 1896. It was submitted to several people who were  present at the Bloomington Convention, and they said it was remarkably  accurate considering that it was not taken down stenographically.          _From his Speech on the Dred Scott Decision. Springfield, Illinois. June  26, 1857_      ... And now as to the Dred Scott decision. That decision declares two  propositions,--first, that a negro cannot sue in the United States  courts; and secondly, that Congress cannot prohibit slavery in the  Territories. It was made by a divided court,--dividing differently on  the different points. Judge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the  decision, and in that respect I shall follow his example, believing I  could no more improve on McLean and Curtis than he could on Taney.    He denounces all who question the correctness of that decision, as  offering violent resistance to it. But who resists it? Who has, in spite  of the decision, declared Dred Scott free, and resisted the authority of  his master over him?    Judicial decisions have two uses: first, to absolutely determine the  case decided; and secondly, to indicate to the public how other similar  cases will be decided when they arise. For the latter use, they are  called \"precedents\" and \"authorities.\"    We believe as much as Judge Douglas (perhaps more) in obedience to and  respect for the judicial department of government. We think its  decisions on constitutional questions, when fully settled, should  control not only the particular cases decided, but the general policy of  the country, subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the  Constitution, as provided in that instrument itself. More than this  would be revolution. But we think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous.  We know the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions,  and we shall do what we can to have it overrule this. We offer no  resistance to it.    Judicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents  according to circumstances. That this should be so, accords both with  common-sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession.    If this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of  the judges, and without any apparent partisan bias, and in accordance  with legal public expectation, and with the steady practice of the  departments throughout our history, and had been in no part based on  assumed historical facts, which are not really true; or if wanting in  some of these, it had been before the court more than once, and had  there been affirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years,--it then  might be, perhaps would be factious, nay, even revolutionary, not to  acquiesce in it as a precedent.    But when, as is true, we find it wanting in all these claims to the  public confidence, it is not resistance, it is not factious, it is not  even disrespectful to treat it as not having yet quite established a  settled doctrine for the country.    I have said in substance, that the Dred Scott decision was in part based  on assumed historical facts which were not really true, and I ought not  to leave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this, I  therefore give an instance or two, which I think fully sustain me. Chief  Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court,  insists at great length that negroes were no part of the people who  made, or for whom was made, the Declaration of Independence, or the  Constitution of the United States.    On the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in  five of the then thirteen States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,  New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters, and  in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the  Constitution that the white people had. He shows this with so much  particularity as to leave no doubt of its truth; and as a sort of  conclusion on that point, holds the following language:         \"The Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the       United States, through the action, in each State, of those persons       who were qualified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of       themselves and all other citizens of the State. In some of the       States, as we have seen, coloured persons were among those       qualified by law to act on the subject. These coloured persons were       not only included in the body of 'the people of the United States'       by whom the Constitution was ordained and established; but in at       least five of the States they had the power to act, and doubtless       did act, by their suffrages, upon the question of its adoption.\"    Again, Chief Justice Taney says:         \"It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public       opinion, in relation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed in       the civilized and enlightened portions of the world at the time of       the Declaration of Independence, and when the Constitution of the       United States was framed and adopted.\"    And again, after quoting from the Declaration, he says:         \"The general words above quoted would seem to include the whole       human family, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this       day, would be so understood.\"    In these the Chief Justice does not directly assert, but plainly assumes  as a fact, that the public estimate of the black man is more favourable  now than it was in the days of the Revolution. This assumption is a  mistake. In some trifling particulars the condition of that race has  been ameliorated; but as a whole, in this country, the change between  then and now is decidedly the other way; and their ultimate destiny has  never appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years. In two  of the five States--New Jersey and North Carolina--that then gave the  free negro the right of voting, the right has since been taken away; and  in a third--New York--it has been greatly abridged: while it has not  been extended, so far as I know, to a single additional State, though  the number of the States has more than doubled. In those days, as I  understand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate their  slaves; but since then such legal restraints have been made upon  emancipation as to amount almost to prohibition. In those days  legislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their  respective States; but now it is becoming quite fashionable for State  constitutions to withhold that power from the legislatures. In those  days, by common consent, the spread of the black man's bondage to the  new countries was prohibited; but now Congress decides that it will not  continue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court decides that it could  not if it would. In those days our Declaration of Independence was held  sacred by all, and thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the  bondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is"]]]
