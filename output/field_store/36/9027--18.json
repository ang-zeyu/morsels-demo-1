And in the early morning, as he rode forth with the dwarf towards Camelot,  he heard a knight call loudly after him, \"Turn, turn! Abide, Sir knight,  and yield me up the hound thou tookest from my lady.\" At which he turned,  and saw a great and strong knight, armed full splendidly, riding down upon  him fiercely through a glade of the forest.    Now Sir Tor was very ill provided, for he had but an old courser, which  was as weak as himself, because of the hermit's scanty fare. He waited,  nevertheless, for the strange knight to come, and at the first onset with  their spears, each unhorsed the other, and then fell to with their swords  like two mad lions. Then did they smite through one another's shields and  helmets till the fragments flew on all sides, and their blood ran out in  streams; but yet they carved and rove through the thick armour of the  hauberks, and gave each other great and ghastly wounds. But in the end,  Sir Tor, finding the strange knight faint, doubled his strokes until he  beat him to the earth. Then did he bid him yield to his mercy.    \"That will I not,\" replied Abellius, \"while my life lasteth and my soul is  in my body, unless thou give me first the hound.\"    \"I cannot,\" said Sir Tor, \"and will not, for it was my quest to bring  again that hound and thee unto King Arthur, or otherwise to slay thee.\"    With that there came a damsel riding on a palfrey, as fast as she could  drive, and cried out to Sir Tor with a loud voice, \"I pray thee, for King  Arthur's love, give me a gift.\"    \"Ask,\" said Sir Tor, \"and I will give thee.\"    \"Grammercy,\" said the lady, \"I ask the head of this false knight Abellius,  the most outrageous murderer that liveth.\"    \"I repent me of the gift I promised,\" said Sir Tor. \"Let him make thee  amends for all his trespasses against thee.\"    \"He cannot make amends,\" replied the damsel, \"for he hath slain my  brother, a far better knight than he, and scorned to give him mercy,  though I kneeled for half an hour before him in the mire, to beg it, and  though it was but by a chance they fought, and for no former injury or  quarrel. I require my gift of thee as a true knight, or else will I shame  thee in King Arthur's court; for this Abellius is the falsest knight  alive, and a murderer of many.\"    When Abellius heard this, he trembled greatly, and was sore afraid, and  yielded to Sir Tor, and prayed his mercy.    \"I cannot now, Sir knight,\" said he, \"lest I be false to my promise. Ye  would not take my mercy when I offered it; and now it is too late.\"    Therewith he unlaced his helmet, and took it off; but Abellius, in dismal  fear, struggled to his feet, and fled, until Sir Tor overtook him, and  smote off his head entirely with one blow.    \"Now, sir,\" said the damsel, \"it is near night, I pray ye come and lodge  at my castle hard by.\"    \"I will, with a good will,\" said he, for both his horse and he had fared  but poorly since they left Camelot.    So he went to the lady's castle and fared sumptuously, and saw her  husband, an old knight, who greatly thanked him for his service, and urged  him oftentimes to come again.    On the morrow he departed, and reached Camelot by noon, where the king and  queen rejoiced to see him, and the king made him Earl; and Merlin  prophesied that these adventures were but little to the things he should  achieve hereafter.    Now while Sir Gawain and Sir Tor had fulfilled their quests, King  Pellinore pursued the lady whom the knight had seized away from the  wedding-feast. And as he rode through the woods, he saw in a valley a fair  young damsel sitting by a well-side, and a wounded knight lying in her  arms, and King Pellinore saluted her as he passed by.    As soon as she perceived him she cried out, \"Help, help me, knight, for  our Lord's sake!\" But Pellinore was far too eager in his quest to stay or  turn, although she cried a hundred times to him for help; at which she  prayed to heaven he might have such sore need before he died as she had  now. And presently thereafter her knight died in her arms; and she, for  grief and love slew herself with his sword.    But King Pellinore rode on till he met a poor man and asked him had he  seen a knight pass by that way leading by force a lady with him.    \"Yea, surely,\" said the man, \"and greatly did she moan and cry; but even  now another knight is fighting with him to deliver the lady; ride on and  thou shalt find them fighting still.\"    At that King Pellinore rode swiftly on, and came to where he saw the two  knights fighting, hard by where two pavilions stood. And when he looked in  one of them he saw the lady that was his quest, and with her the two  squires of the two knights who fought.    \"Fair lady,\" said he, \"ye must come with me unto Arthur's court.\"    \"Sir knight,\" said the two squires, \"yonder be two knights fighting for  this lady; go part them, and get their consent to take her, ere thou touch  her.\"    \"Ye say well,\" said King Pellinore, and rode between the combatants, and  asked them why they fought.    \"Sir knight,\" said the one, \"yon lady is my cousin, mine aunt's daughter,  whom I met borne away against her will, by this knight here, with whom I  therefore fight to free her.\"    \"Sir knight,\" replied the other, whose name was Hantzlake of Wentland,  \"this lady got I, by my arms and prowess, at King Arthur's court to-day.\"    \"That is false,\" said King Pellinore; \"ye stole the lady suddenly, and  fled away with her, before any knight could arm to stay thee. But it is my  service to take her back again. Neither of ye shall therefore have her;  but if ye will fight for her, fight with me now and here.\"    \"Well,\" said the knights, \"make ready, and we will assail thee with all  our might.\"    Then Sir Hantzlake ran King Pellinore's horse through with his sword, so  that they might be all alike on foot. But King Pellinore at that was  passing wroth, and ran upon Sir Hantzlake, with a cry, \"Keep well thy  head!\" and gave him such a stroke upon the helm as clove him to the chin,  so that he fell dead to the ground. When he saw that, the other knight  refused to fight, and kneeling down said, \"Take my cousin the lady with  thee, as thy quest is; but as thou art a true knight, suffer her to come  to neither shame nor harm.\"    So the next day King Pellinore departed for Camelot, and took the lady  with him; and as they rode in a valley full of rough stones, the damsel's  horse stumbled and threw her, so that her arms were sorely bruised and  hurt. And as they rested in the forest for the pain to lessen, night came  on, and there they were compelled to make their lodging. A little before  midnight they heard the trotting of a horse. \"Be ye still,\" said King  Pellinore, \"for now we may hear of some adventure,\" and therewith he armed  him. Then he heard two knights meet and salute each other, in the dark;  one riding from Camelot, the other from the north.    \"What tidings at Camelot?\" said one.    \"By my head,\" said the other, \"I have but just left there, and have espied  King Arthur's court, and such a fellowship is there as never may be broke  or overcome; for wellnigh all the chivalry of the world is there, and all  full loyal to the king, and now I ride back homewards to the north to tell  our chiefs, that they waste not their strength in wars against him.\"    \"As for all that,\" replied the other knight, \"I am but now from the north,  and bear with me a remedy, the deadliest poison that ever was heard tell  of, and to Camelot will I with it; for there we have a friend close to the  king, and greatly cherished of him, who hath received gifts from us to  poison him, as he hath promised soon to do.\"    \"Beware,\" said the first knight, \"of Merlin, for he knoweth all things, by  the devil's craft.\"    \"I will not fear for that,\" replied the other, and so rode on his way.    Anon King Pellinore and the lady passed on again; and when they came to  the well at which the lady with the wounded knight had sat, they found  both knight and Damsel utterly devoured by lions and wild beasts, all save  the lady's head.    When King Pellinore saw that, he wept bitterly, saying, \"Alas! I might  have saved her life had I but tarried a few moments in my quest.\"    \"Wherefore make so much sorrow now?\" said the lady.    \"I know not,\" answered he, \"but my heart grieveth greatly for this poor  lady's death, so fair she was and young.\"    Then he required a hermit to bury the remains of the bodies, and bare the  lady's head with him to Camelot, to the court.    When he was arrived, he was sworn to tell the truth of his quest before  the King and Queen, and when he had entered the Queen somewhat upbraided  him, saying, \"Ye were much to blame that ye saved not that lady's life.\"    \"Madam,\" said he, \"I shall repent it all my life.\"    \"Ay, king,\" quoth Merlin, who suddenly came in, \"and so ye ought to do,  for that lady was your daughter, not seen since infancy by thee. And she  was on her way to court, with a right good young knight, who would have  been her husband, but was slain by treachery of a felon knight, Lorraine  le Savage, as they came; and because thou wouldst not abide and help her,  thy best friend shall fail thee in thine hour of greatest need, for such  is the penance ordained thee for that deed.\"    Then did King Pellinore tell Merlin secretly of the treason he had heard  in the forest, and Merlin by his craft so ordered that the knight who bare  the poison was himself soon after slain by it, and so King Arthur's life  was saved.          CHAPTER VII    _King Arthur and Sir Accolon of Gaul_      Being now happily married, King Arthur for a season took his pleasure,  with great tournaments, and jousts, and huntings. So once upon a time the  king and many of his knights rode hunting in a forest, and Arthur, King  Urience, and Sir Accolon of Gaul, followed after a great hart, and being  all three well mounted, they chased "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12758"],[0,"Library of the World's Best Mystery and Detective Stories (#16)"],[1,"Mauerer, without awaiting the end of his speech, frowned and  said:    \"Kasper Boeck, begin by taking off your hat, put your dog out of the  room, and then speak distinctly, intelligibly, without stammering, so  that I may understand you.\"    Hereupon the burgomaster, standing near the table, tranquilly emptied  his little glass and wiped his great gray mustachios indifferently.    Kasper put his dog out, and came back with his hat off.    \"Well!\" said Petrus, seeing that he was silent, \"what has happened?\"    \"It happens that the _spirit_ has appeared again in the ruins of  Geierstein!\"    \"Ha! I doubt it. You've seen it yourself?\"    \"Very clearly, Mr. Burgomaster.\"    \"Without closing your eyes?\"    \"Yes, Mr. Burgomaster--my eyes were wide open. There was plenty of  moonlight.\"    \"What form did it have?\"    \"The form of a small man.\"    \"Good!\"    And turning toward a glass door at the left:    \"Katel!\" cried the burgomaster.    An old serving woman opened the door.    \"Sir?\"    \"I am going out for a walk--on the hillside--sit up for me until ten  o'clock. Here's the key.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    Then the old soldier took down his gun from the hook over the door,  examined the priming, and slung it over his shoulder; then he addressed  Kasper Boeck:    \"Go and tell the rural guard to meet me in the holly path, and tell him  behind the mill. Your _spirit_ must be some marauder. But if it's a  fox, I'll make a fine hood of it, with long earlaps.\"    Master Petrus Mauerer and humble Kasper then went out. The weather was  superb, the stars innumerable. While the shepherd went to knock at the  rural guard's door, the burgomaster plunged among the elder bushes, in  a little lane that wound around behind the old church.    Two minutes later Kasper and Hans Goerner, whinger at his side, by  running overtook Master Petrus in the holly path.    All three made their way together toward the ruins of Geierstein.    These ruins, which are twenty minutes' walk from the village, seem to  be insignificant enough; they consist of the ridges of a few decrepit  walls, from four to six feet high, which extend among the brier bushes.  Archaeologists call them the aqueducts of Seranus, the Roman camp of  Holderlock, or vestiges of Theodoric, according to their fantasy. The  only thing about these ruins which could be considered remarkable is a  stairway to a cistern cut in the rock. Inside of this spiral staircase,  instead of concentric circles which twist around with each complete  turn, the involutions become wider as they proceed, in such a way that  the bottom of the pit is three times as large as the opening. Is it an  architectural freak, or did some reasonable cause determine such an odd  construction? It matters little to us. The result was to cause in the  cistern that vague reverberation which anyone may hear upon placing a  shell at his ear, and to make you aware of steps on the gravel path,  murmurs of the air, rustling of the leaves, and even distant words  spoken by people passing the foot of the hill.    Our three personages then followed the pathway between the vineyards  and gardens of Hirschwiller.    \"I see nothing,\" the burgomaster would say, turning up his nose  derisively.    \"Nor I either,\" the rural guard would repeat, imitating the other's  tone.    \"It's down in the hole,\" muttered the shepherd.    \"We shall see, we shall see,\" returned the burgomaster.    It was in this fashion, after a quarter of an hour, that they came upon  the opening of the cistern. As I have said, the night was clear,  limpid, and perfectly still.    The moon portrayed, as far as the eye could reach, one of those  nocturnal landscapes in bluish lines, studded with slim trees, the  shadows of which seemed to have been drawn with a black crayon. The  blooming brier and broom perfumed the air with a rather sharp odor, and  the frogs of a neighboring swamp sang their oily anthem, interspersed  with silences. But all these details escaped the notice of our good  rustics; they thought of nothing but laying hands on the _spirit_.    When they had reached the stairway, all three stopped and listened,  then gazed into the dark shadows. Nothing appeared--nothing stirred.    \"The devil!\" said the burgomaster, \"we forgot to bring a bit of candle.  Descend, Kasper, you know the way better than I--I'll follow you.\"    At this proposition the shepherd recoiled promptly. If he had consulted  his inclinations the poor man would have taken to flight; his pitiful  expression made the burgomaster burst out laughing.    \"Well, Hans, since he doesn't want to go down, show me the way,\" he  said to the game warden.    \"But, Mr. Burgomaster,\" said the latter, \"you know very well that steps  are missing; we should risk breaking our necks.\"    \"Then what's to be done?\"    \"Yes, what's to be done?\"    \"Send your dog,\" replied Petrus.    The shepherd whistled to his dog, showed him the stairway, urged  him--but he did not wish to take the chances any more than the others.    At this moment, a bright idea struck the rural guardsman.    \"Ha! Mr. Burgomaster,\" said he, \"if you should fire your gun inside.\"    \"Faith,\" cried the other, \"you're right, we shall catch a glimpse at  least.\"    And without hesitating the worthy man approached the stairway and  leveled his gun.    But, by the acoustic effect which I have already pointed out, the  _spirit_, the marauder, the individual who chanced to be actually in  the cistern, had heard everything. The idea of stopping a gunshot did  not strike him as amusing, for in a shrill, piercing voice he cried:    \"Stop! Don't fire--I'm coming.\"    Then the three functionaries looked at each other and laughed softly,  and the burgomaster, leaning over the opening again, cried rudely:    \"Be quick about it, you varlet, or I'll shoot! Be quick about it!\"    He cocked his gun, and the click seemed to hasten the ascent of the  mysterious person; they heard him rolling down some stones.  Nevertheless it still took him another minute before he appeared, the  cistern being at a depth of sixty feet.    What was this man doing in such deep darkness? He must be some great  criminal! So at least thought Petrus Mauerer and his acolytes.    At last a vague form could be discerned in the dark, then slowly, by  degrees, a little man, four and a half feet high at the most, frail,  ragged, his face withered and yellow, his eye gleaming like a magpie's,  and his hair tangled, came out shouting:    \"By what right do you come to disturb my studies, wretched creatures?\"    This grandiose apostrophe was scarcely in accord with his costume and  physiognomy. Accordingly the burgomaster indignantly replied:    \"Try to show that you're honest, you knave, or I'll begin by  administering a correction.\"    \"A correction!\" said the little man, leaping with anger, and drawing  himself up under the nose of the burgomaster.    \"Yes,\" replied the other, who, nevertheless, did not fail to admire the  pygmy's courage; \"if you do not answer the questions satisfactorily I  am going to put to you. I am the burgomaster of Hirschwiller; here are  the rural guard, the shepherd and his dog. We are stronger than you--be  wise and tell me peaceably who you are, what you are doing here, and  why you do not dare to appear in broad daylight. Then we shall see  what's to be done with you.\"    \"All that's none of your business,\" replied the little man in his  cracked voice. \"I shall not answer.\"    \"In that case, forward, march,\" ordered the burgomaster, who grasped  him firmly by the nape of the neck; \"you are going to sleep in prison.\"    The little man writhed like a weasel; he even tried to bite, and the  dog was sniffing at the calves of his legs, when, quite exhausted, he  said, not without a certain dignity:    \"Let go, sir, I surrender to superior force--I'm yours!\"    The burgomaster, who was not entirely lacking in good breeding, became  calmer.    \"Do you promise?\" said he.    \"I promise!\"    \"Very well--walk in front.\"    And that is how, on the night of the 29th of July, 1835, the  burgomaster took captive a little red-haired man, issuing from the  cavern of Geierstein.    Upon arriving at Hirschwiller the rural guard ran to find the key of  the prison and the vagabond was locked in and double-locked, not to  forget the outside bolt and padlock.    Everyone then could repose after his fatigues, and Petrus Mauerer went  to bed and dreamed till midnight of this singular adventure.    On the morrow, toward nine o'clock, Hans Goerner, the rural guard,  having been ordered to bring the prisoner to the town house for another  examination, repaired to the cooler with four husky daredevils. They  opened the door, all of them curious to look upon the Will-o'-the-wisp.  But imagine their astonishment upon seeing him hanging from the bars of  the window by his necktie! Some said that he was still writhing; others  that he was already stiff. However that may be, they ran to Petrus  Mauerer's house to inform him of the fact, and what is certain is that  upon the latter's arrival the little man had breathed his last.    The justice of the peace and the doctor of Hirschwiller drew up a  formal statement of the catastrophe; then they buried the unknown in a  field of meadow grass and it was all over!    Now about three weeks after these occurrences, I went to see my cousin,  Petrus Mauerer, whose nearest relative I was, and consequently his  heir. This circumstance sustained an intimate acquaintance between us.  We were at dinner, talking on indifferent matters, when the burgomaster  recounted the foregoing little story, as I have just reported it.    \"'Tis strange, cousin,\" said I, \"truly strange. And you have no other  information concerning the unknown?\"    \"None.\"    \"And you have found nothing which could give you a clew as to his  purpose?\"    \"Absolutely nothing, Christian.\"    \"But, as a matter of fact, what could he have been doing in the  cistern? On what did he live?"]]]
