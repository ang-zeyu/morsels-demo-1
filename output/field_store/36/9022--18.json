You have derided your femininity,      where you have suspected it; whereas, you should have known      its power, cherished and utilized it, for it is the hidden      well-spring of Intuition and Imagination. What can the brain      accomplish without these two? They are the man's two inner      eyes; without them he is stone blind. For the mind sets forth      their powers both together. One carries the light, the other      searches; and between them they find treasures. These they      bring to the brain, which first elaborates them, then says to      the will, \"Do\"--and Action follows. Poetically considered,      as far as the huge, disordered resultant mass of your      Architecture is concerned, Intuition and Imagination have not      gone forth to illuminate and search the hearts of the people.      Thus are its works stone blind.    It is the absence of poetry and beauty which makes our architecture  so depressing to the spirits. \"Poetry as a living thing,\" says Mr.  Sullivan, \"stands for the most telling quality that a man can impart  to his thoughts. Judged by this test your buildings are dreary, empty  places.\" Artists in words, like Lafcadio Hearn and Henry James, are  able to make articulate the sadness which our cities inspire, but  it is a blight which lies heavy on us all. Theodore Dreiser says, in  _Sister Carrie_--a book with so much bitter truth in it that it was  suppressed by the original publishers:        Once the bright days of summer pass by, a city takes on the      sombre garb of grey, wrapped in which it goes about its labors      during the long winter. Its endless buildings look grey,      its sky and its streets assume a sombre hue; the scattered,      leafless trees and wind-blown dust and paper but add to the      general solemnity of color. There seems to be something in      the chill breezes which scurry through the long, narrow      thoroughfares productive of rueful thoughts. Not poets alone,      nor artists, nor that superior order of mind which arrogates      to itself all refinement, feel this, but dogs and all men.    The excuse that we are too young a people to have developed an  architecture instinct with that natural poetry which so charms us in  the art of other countries and other times, Mr. Sullivan disposes  of in characteristic fashion. To the plea that \"We are too young to  consider these accomplishments. We have been so busy with our material  development that we have not found time to consider them,\" he makes  answer as follows:        Know, then, to begin with, they are not accomplishments but      necessaries. And, to end with, you are old enough, and      have found the time to succeed in nearly making a fine art      of--Betrayal, and a science of--Graft. Know that you are      as old as the race. That each man among you had in him the      accumulated power of the race, ready at hand for use, in the      right way, when he shall conclude it better to think straight      and hence act straight rather than, as now, to act crooked      and pretend to be straight. Know that the test, plain, simple      _honesty_ (and you all know, every man of you knows, exactly      what that means) is always at your hand.        Know that as all complex manifestations have a simple basis      of origin, so the vast complexity of your national unrest, ill      health, inability to think clearly and accurately concerning      simple things, really vital things, is easily traceable to the      single, actual, active cause--Dishonesty; and that this points      with unescapable logic and in just measure to each individual      man!        The remedy;--_individual honesty_.    To the objection that this is too simple a solution, Mr. Sullivan  retorts that all great solutions are simple, that the basic things of  the universe are those which the heart of a child might comprehend.  \"Honesty stands in the universe of Human Thought and Action, as its  very Centre of Gravity, and is our human mask-word behind which abides  all the power of Nature's Integrity, the profoundest _fact_ which  modern thinking has persuaded Life to reveal.\"    If, on the other hand, the reader complains, \"All this is above our  heads,\" Mr. Sullivan is equally ready with an answer:        No, it is not. _It is close beside your hand!_ and therein      lies its power.        Again you say, \"How can honesty be enforced?\"        It cannot be enforced!        \"Then how will the remedy go into effect?\"        It cannot _go_ into effect. It can only come into effect.        \"Then how can it come?\"        Ask Nature.        \"And what will Nature say?\"        Nature is always saying: \"I centre at each man, woman and      child. I knock at the door of each heart, and I wait. I wait      in patience--ready to enter with my gifts.\"        \"And is that all that Nature says?\"        That is all.        \"Then how shall we receive Nature?\"        By opening wide your minds! For your greatest crime against      yourselves is that you have locked the door and thrown away      the key!      Thus, by a long detour, Mr. Sullivan returns to his initial  proposition, that the falsity of our architecture can be corrected  only by integrity of thought. \"Thought is the fine and powerful  instrument. Therefore, _have thought for the integrity of your own  thought_.\"        Naturally, then, as your thoughts thus change, your growing      architecture will change. Its falsity will depart; its reality      will gradually appear. For the integrity of your thought as      a People, will then have penetrated the minds of your      architects.        Then, too, _as your basic thought changes, will emerge a      philosophy, a poetry, and an art of expression in all things;      for you will have learned that a characteristic philosophy,      poetry and art of expression are vital to the healthful growth      and development of a democratic people_.    Some readers may complain that these are after all only glittering  generalities, of no practical use in solving the specific problems  with which every architect is confronted. On the contrary they are  fundamental verities of incalculable benefit to every sincere artist.  Shallowness is the great vice of democracy; it is surface without  depth, a welter of concrete detail in which the mind easily loses  those great, underlying abstractions from which alone great art can  spring. These, in this essay, Mr. Sullivan helps us to recapture, and  inspires us to employ. He would win us from our insincerities, our  trivialities, and awaken our enormous latent, unused power. He says:        Awaken it.        Use it.        Use it for the common good.        Begin now!        For it is as true today as when one of your wise men said      it:--        \"The way to resume is to resume!\"          COLOR AND CERAMICS      The production of ceramics--perhaps the oldest of all the useful  arts practised by man; an art with a magnificent history--seems to be  entering upon a new era of development. It is more alive today, more  generally, more skilfully, though not more _artfully_ practised than  ever before. It should therefore be of interest to all lovers of  architecture, in view of the increasing importance of ceramics in  building, to consider the ways in which these materials may best be  used.    Looking at the matter in the broadest possible way, it may be said  that the building impulse throughout the ages has expressed itself  in two fundamentally different types of structure: that in which the  architecture--and even the ornament--is one with the engineering; and  that in which the two elements are separable, not in thought alone,  but in fact. For brevity let us name that manner of building in which  the architecture is the construction, _Inherent_ architecture, and  that manner in which the two are separable _Incrusted_ architecture.    To the first class belong the architectures of Egypt, Greece, and  Gothic architecture as practised in the north of Europe; to the  second belong Roman architecture of the splendid period, Moorish  architecture, and Italian Gothic, so called. In the first class the  bones of the building were also its flesh; in the second bones and  flesh were in a manner separable, as is proven by the fact that they  were separately considered, separately fashioned. Ruined Karnak, the  ruined Parthenon, wrecked Rheims, show ornament so integral a part  of the fabric--etched so deep--that what has survived of the one has  survived also of the other; while the ruined Baths of Caracalla the  uncompleted church of S. Petronio in Bologna, and many a stark mosque  on many a sandy desert show only bare skeletons of whose completed  glory we can only guess. In them the fabric was a framework for the  display of the lapidary or the ceramic art--a garment destroyed, rent,  or tattered by time and chance, leaving the bones still strong, but  bare.    This classification of architecture into Inherent and Incrusted is not  to be confused with the discrimination between architecture that is  _Arranged_, and architecture that is _Organic_, a classification which  is based on psychology--like the difference between the business man  and the poet: talent and genius--whereas the classification which  the reader is asked now to consider is based rather on the matter  of expediency in the use of materials. Let us draw no invidious  comparisons between Inherent and Incrusted architecture, but regard  each as the adequate expression of an ideal type of beauty; the one  masculine, since in the male figure the osseous framework is more  easily discernible; the other feminine, because more concealed and  overlaid with a cellular tissue of shining, precious materials, on  which the disruptive forces in man and nature are more free to act.    It is scarcely necessary to state that it is with Incrusted  architecture that we are alone concerned in this discussion, for to  this class almost"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#16)"],[1,"air,\" plural  _izbel_; _a-slem_ \"fish,\" plural _i-slim-en_; _sn_ \"to know,\" _sen_ \"to  be knowing\"; _rmi_ \"to become tired,\" _rumni_ \"to be tired\"; _ttss_[40]  \"to fall asleep,\" _ttoss_ \"to sleep.\" Strikingly similar to English and  Greek alternations of the type _sing_--_sang_ and _leip-o_ \"I leave,\"  _leloip-a_ \"I have left,\" are such Somali[41] cases as _al_ \"I am,\" _il_  \"I was\"; _i-dah-a_ \"I say,\" _i-di_ \"I said,\" _deh_ \"say!\"    [Footnote 37: Egyptian dialect.]    [Footnote 38: There are changes of accent and vocalic quantity in these  forms as well, but the requirements of simplicity force us to neglect  them.]    [Footnote 39: A Berber language of Morocco.]    [Footnote 40: Some of the Berber languages allow consonantal  combinations that seem unpronounceable to us.]    [Footnote 41: One of the Hamitic languages of eastern Africa.]    Vocalic change is of great significance also in a number of American  Indian languages. In the Athabaskan group many verbs change the quality  or quantity of the vowel of the radical element as it changes its tense  or mode. The Navaho verb for \"I put (grain) into a receptacle\" is  _bi-hi-sh-ja_, in which _-ja_ is the radical element; the past tense,  _bi-hi-ja'_, has a long _a_-vowel, followed by the \"glottal stop\"[42];  the future is _bi-h-de-sh-ji_ with complete change of vowel. In other  types of Navaho verbs the vocalic changes follow different lines, e.g.,  _yah-a-ni-ye_ \"you carry (a pack) into (a stable)\"; past, _yah-i-ni-yin_  (with long _i_ in _-yin_; _-n_ is here used to indicate nasalization);  future, _yah-a-di-yehl_ (with long _e_). In another Indian language,  Yokuts[43], vocalic modifications affect both noun and verb forms. Thus,  _buchong_ \"son\" forms the plural _bochang-i_ (contrast the objective  _buchong-a_); _enash_ \"grandfather,\" the plural _inash-a_; the verb  _engtyim_ \"to sleep\" forms the continuative _ingetym-ad_ \"to be  sleeping\" and the past _ingetym-ash_.    [Footnote 42: See page 49.]    [Transcriber's note: Footnote 42 refers to the paragraph beginning on  line 1534.]    [Footnote 43: Spoken in the south-central part of California.]    Consonantal change as a functional process is probably far less common  than vocalic modifications, but it is not exactly rare. There is an  interesting group of cases in English, certain nouns and corresponding  verbs differing solely in that the final consonant is voiceless or  voiced. Examples are _wreath_ (with _th_ as in _think_), but _to  wreathe_ (with _th_ as in _then_); _house_, but _to house_ (with _s_  pronounced like _z_). That we have a distinct feeling for the  interchange as a means of distinguishing the noun from the verb is  indicated by the extension of the principle by many Americans to such a  noun as _rise_ (e.g., _the rise of democracy_)--pronounced like  _rice_--in contrast to the verb _to rise_ (_s_ like _z_).    In the Celtic languages the initial consonants undergo several types of  change according to the grammatical relation that subsists between the  word itself and the preceding word. Thus, in modern Irish, a word like  _bo_ \"ox\" may under the appropriate circumstances, take the forms _bho_  (pronounce _wo_) or _mo_ (e.g., _an bo_ \"the ox,\" as a subject, but _tir  na mo_ \"land of the oxen,\" as a possessive plural). In the verb the  principle has as one of its most striking consequences the \"aspiration\"  of initial consonants in the past tense. If a verb begins with _t_, say,  it changes the _t_ to _th_ (now pronounced _h_) in forms of the past; if  it begins with _g_, the consonant changes, in analogous forms, to _gh_  (pronounced like a voiced spirant[44] _g_ or like _y_, according to the  nature of the following vowel). In modern Irish the principle of  consonantal change, which began in the oldest period of the language as  a secondary consequence of certain phonetic conditions, has become one  of the primary grammatical processes of the language.    [Footnote 44: See page 50.]    [Transcriber's note: Footnote 44 refers to the paragraph beginning on  line 1534.]    Perhaps as remarkable as these Irish phenomena are the consonantal  interchanges of Ful, an African language of the Soudan. Here we find  that all nouns belonging to the personal class form the plural by  changing their initial _g_, _j_, _d_, _b_, _k_, _ch_, and _p_ to _y_ (or  _w_), _y_, _r_, _w_, _h_, _s_ and _f_ respectively; e.g., _jim-o_  \"companion,\" _yim-'be_ \"companions\"; _pio-o_ \"beater,\" _fio-'be_  \"beaters.\" Curiously enough, nouns that belong to the class of things  form their singular and plural in exactly reverse fashion, e.g.,  _yola-re_ \"grass-grown place,\" _jola-je_ \"grass-grown places\";  _fitan-du_ \"soul,\" _pital-i_ \"souls.\" In Nootka, to refer to but one  other language in which the process is found, the _t_ or _tl_[45] of  many verbal suffixes becomes _hl_ in forms denoting repetition, e.g.,  _hita-'ato_ \"to fall out,\" _hita-'ahl_ \"to keep falling out\";  _mat-achisht-utl_ \"to fly on to the water,\" _mat-achisht-ohl_ \"to keep  flying on to the water.\" Further, the _hl_ of certain elements changes  to a peculiar _h_-sound in plural forms, e.g., _yak-ohl_ \"sore-faced,\"  _yak-oh_ \"sore-faced (people).\"    [Footnote 45: These orthographies are but makeshifts for simple sounds.]    Nothing is more natural than the prevalence of reduplication, in other  words, the repetition of all or part of the radical element. The process  is generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such  concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity,  increase of size, added intensity, continuance. Even in English it is  not unknown, though it is not generally accounted one of the typical  formative devices of our language. Such words as _goody-goody_ and _to  pooh-pooh_ have become accepted as part of our normal vocabulary, but  the method of duplication may on occasion be used more freely than is  indicated by such stereotyped examples. Such locutions as _a big big  man_ or _Let it cool till it's thick thick_ are far more common,  especially in the speech of women and children, than our linguistic  text-books would lead one to suppose. In a class by themselves are the  really enormous number of words, many of them sound-imitative or  contemptuous in psychological tone, that consist of duplications with  either change of the vowel or change of the initial consonant--words of  the type _sing-song_, _riff-raff_, _wishy-washy_, _harum-skarum_,  _roly-poly_. Words of this type are all but universal. Such examples as  the Russian _Chudo-Yudo_ (a dragon), the Chinese _ping-pang_ \"rattling  of rain on the roof,\"[46] the Tibetan _kyang-kyong_ \"lazy,\" and the  Manchu _porpon parpan_ \"blear-eyed\" are curiously reminiscent, both in  form and in psychology, of words nearer home. But it can hardly be said  that the duplicative process is of a distinctively grammatical  significance in English. We must turn to other languages for  illustration. Such cases as Hottentot _go-go_ \"to look at carefully\"  (from _go_ \"to see\"), Somali _fen-fen_ \"to gnaw at on all sides\" (from  _fen_ \"to gnaw at\"), Chinook _iwi iwi_ \"to look about carefully, to  examine\" (from _iwi_ \"to appear\"), or Tsimshian _am'am_ \"several (are)  good\" (from _am_ \"good\") do not depart from the natural and fundamental  range of significance of the process. A more abstract function is  illustrated in Ewe,[47] in which both infinitives and verbal adjectives  are formed from verbs by duplication; e.g., _yi_ \"to go,\" _yiyi_ \"to go,  act of going\"; _wo_ \"to do,\" _wowo_[48] \"done\"; _mawomawo_ \"not to do\"  (with both duplicated verb stem and duplicated negative particle).  Causative duplications are characteristic of Hottentot, e.g.,  _gam-gam_[49] \"to cause to tell\" (from _gam_ \"to tell\"). Or the process  may be used to derive verbs from nouns, as in Hottentot _khoe-khoe_ \"to  talk Hottentot\" (from _khoe-b_ \"man, Hottentot\"), or as in Kwakiutl  _metmat_ \"to eat clams\" (radical element _met-_ \"clam\").    [Footnote 46: Whence our _ping-pong_.]    [Footnote 47: An African language of the Guinea Coast.]    [Footnote 48: In the verbal adjective the tone of the second syllable  differs from that of the first.]    [Footnote 49: Initial \"click\" (see page 55, note 15) omitted.]    [Transcriber's note: Footnote 49 refers to Footnote 24, beginning on  line 1729.]    The most characteristic examples of reduplication are such as repeat  only part of the radical element. It would be possible to demonstrate  the existence of a vast number of formal types of such partial  duplication, according to whether the process makes use of one or more  of the radical consonants, preserves or weakens or alters the radical  vowel, or affects the beginning, the middle, or the end of the radical  element. The functions are even more exuberantly developed than with  simple duplication, though the basic notion, at least in origin, is  nearly always one of repetition or continuance. Examples illustrating  this fundamental function can be quoted from all parts of the globe.  Initially reduplicating are, for instance, Shilh _ggen_ \"to be sleeping\"  (from _gen_ \"to sleep\"); Ful _pepeu-'do_ \"liar\" (i.e., \"one who always  lies\"), plural _fefeu-'be_ (from _fewa_ \"to lie\"); Bontoc Igorot _anak_  \"child,\" _ananak_ \"children\"; _kamu-ek_ \"I hasten,\" _kakamu-ek_ \"I  hasten more\"; Tsimshian _gyad_ \"person,\" _gyigyad_ \"people\"; Nass  _gyibayuk_ \"to fly,\" _gyigyibayuk_ \"one who is flying.\" Psychologically  comparable, but with the reduplication at the end, are Somali _ur_  \"body,\" plural _urar_; Hausa _suna_ \"name,\" plural _sunana-ki;_  Washo[50] _gusu_ \"buffalo,\" _gususu_ \"buffaloes\"; Takelma[51] _himi-d-_  \"to talk to,\" _himim-d-_ \"to be accustomed to talk to.\" Even more  commonly than simple duplication, this partial duplication of the  radical element has taken on in many languages functions that seem in no  way related to the idea of increase. The best known examples are  probably the"]]]
