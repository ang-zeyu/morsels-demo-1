This cravat is worked on fine muslin, embroidered upon both ends in  raised satin stitch; the scalloped edge is worked in button-hole stitch;  the bouquet in the centre is worked in applique satin stitch--that is,  the leaves of the rose and the foliage are worked separately on muslin;  they are then cut out and worked in applique (see Nos. 113 and 116,  _Embroidery Instructions_) upon the cravat, as seen in the illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    154.--_Sandwich Case_.    Materials: Strip of grey kid; strip of oil silk; 1 skein black silk; 1  skein red purse silk; 1 hank steel beads; steel button.    This case will be found very useful on the occasion of a journey or  picnic, as it can be carried in the pocket without any inconvenience.    The case is made of a strip of grey kid, scalloped out at the edges. The  words \"Bon appetit,\" or \"Good appetite,\" at will, are worked over it in  overcast with black purse silk and steel beads, the scroll pattern in  chain stitch with red silk. The back and front of the case are formed of  the same strip, which is lined with oilskin, and to which narrow  side-pieces are added to form the pocket. These pieces are lined and  scalloped out in the same way as the back and front, and then the  scallops of both sides are joined together, and worked round in  button-hole stitch with purse silk.    The case is fastened down with a steel button.    If another colour is preferred, the sandwich case can be made of brown  kid. The scroll pattern should then be worked in rich blue purse silk,  and gold beads used for the letters, which should be embroidered as  before in black silk. The edge may be worked in double overcast stitch  in blue or black silk. A gold button must replace the steel when this  alteration of colour is made.

Materials: Russia leather; blue silk; black purse silk; blue silk  soutache; fine gold braid; and gold thread.    [Illustration: 157.--Lady's Purse.]    This purse is embroidered upon Russia leather; an oval-shaped medallion  is cut out in the centre; a piece of blue silk is gummed on under the  leather so as to show within the oval; both leather and silk are then  lined with calico and stretched upon a small embroidery frame. The front  and back of the purse are made all of one piece, the centre of which is  the bottom; after the embroidery is completed a piece of leather is  added on each side to give the necessary fullness. Four flowrets are  worked over the blue silk, with black purse silk, in raised satin  stitch, with a dot in gold thread for the centre. The stems are black  and the leaflets gold. The inner border round the oval medallion is  worked in gold braid, and the outer one in blue soutache. The network  upon the leather is formed of threads of black purse silk, fastened at  every crossing with a stitch of gold thread; the outer border round this  network is formed entirely of gold braid. On the opposite side of the  purse initials may be worked in black and gold, over the blue silk oval  medallion.    The purse is lined with brown watered silk, and mounted with a clasp of  gilt steel.           *       *       *       *       *    158.--_Table-Napkin Ring_.

Materials: Grey American cloth; red cloth; black jet beads and bugles;  red worsted braid, three-quarters of an inch wide; some strong wire; a  cigar-box.    [Illustration: 159.--Knife Basket.]    This basket is meant for holding dessert knives. It consists of a common  cigar-box nine inches and two-fifths long, five inches and four-fifths  wide, and two inches and one-fifth high, covered inside and out with  grey American cloth, which is ornamented with embroidery worked in  applique. The seams are made in overcast stitch. The feet consist of  four pieces of strong wire three inches and two-fifths long. These  pieces of wire are first covered with wool, and then with jet beads;  they are then bent into loops, and fastened on at the bottom of the box  by means of holes bored into it for that purpose. The feet must be  fastened before covering the inside of the box. The inside of the basket  is ornamented with an embroidered pattern in applique, which must also  be worked before covering the box. The leaves are made of red cloth, the  stems and veinings of black bugles. No. 160 shows the pattern in full  size; the flowers and leaves are edged with light grey purse silk, over  which small stitches in black silk are fastened at regular intervals.  Inside the box fasten a deal board covered on both sides with American  cloth, so as to divide the basket into two compartments, and fasten on  to this board a handle consisting of a piece of wire seven inches long,  wound round with beads. The basket is ornamented with ruches of red  worsted braid; between two box pleats of the ruche a black bugle is  fastened.

But while the  very large establishments demonstrate by such reports only that they  can find somewhere a fit place for every able workingman if they take  enough trouble to seek for it, after all the essential element of the  reports remains, that successful achievement depends upon personal  mental traits which cannot be acquired by mere good will and training.  In view of this fact it is much more important that by far the  majority of establishments have not such a great manifoldness of  activities under one roof. The workingman who is a failure in the work  which he undertook would usually have no opportunity to show his  strong sides in the same factory, or at least to be protected against  the consequences of his weak points. If his achievement is deficient  in quality or quantity, he generally loses his place and makes a new  trial in another factory under the same accidental conditions, without  any deeper insight into his particular psychical traits and their  relation to special industrial activities. But even in the large  concerns, in which many kinds of labor are needed side by side, it is  not the rule but a rare exception when the individual is  systematically shifted to the psychologically correct place. A whole  combination of conditions is necessary for that. If his mental  unfitness makes him unsuccessful in one place, the position for which  he is fit must happen to be vacant. Moreover, he himself must like  that other kind of work, and above all the foreman must recognize his  particular fitness. In a few model factories in which the apprentice  system is developed in the spirit of advanced sociological ideas, for  instance, in the Lynn factory of the General Electric Company, such  systematic efforts are being carried on and show fair results. But the  regulation plan seems to be a haphazard lack of plan, and even the  best endeavors probably fall short of what may be attained by the  introduction of scientific psychological methods. So far in most  factories the laborer who is not doing well simply loses his position,  and by such an unfortunate experience he is not mentally enriched but  impoverished, as he has lost much of his self-confidence and of his  joy in labor.    If this limitless waste of human material, this pitiable crushing of  joy in the day's work, and this crippling of the economic output is at  last to be reduced, indeed nothing is more needed than a careful  scrutiny of the various psychophysical functions involved in the work.  A mere classification of the industrial occupations according to the  classes of manufactured objects would be of no value for this need, as  often a small industrial concern may embrace occupations which, are  based on many different psychophysical functions. A harvester consists  of two hundred and fifty different parts, and almost every one of  these parts demands a long series of manufacturing, processes.  Thousands of different kinds of labor are thus combined in one factory  and each process demands for the best work particular psychophysical  traits, even though many of them can be carried out by quite unskilled  laborers. In a large manufacturing establishment the manager assured  me only recently that more than half a million different acts have to  be performed in order to complete the goods of that factory. On the  other hand, it evidently is proper to form larger groups in which  processes are brought together which are similar with reference to the  mental activity needed, while they may be dissimilar from the  standpoint of industrial technique.    This analysis of the special processes can be furthered best by the  cooeperation of the experienced men of industry. Many of the replies  which I received contained quite elaborated contributions to such a  study of various industrial processes from a psychological point of  view. They sometimes covered the ground from the simplest activity to  the subtlest and most difficult economic tasks, and this, not only  with reference to the functions of the laborer, but also even with  reference to the function of the industrial manager. The outsider can  see these psychological requirements of the particular occupation only  in crude outlines. The subtler nuances of differences between tasks  can be gained only by an intimate knowledge of the industry. Again I  may give an illustration. In the case of a well-known typesetting  machine, thousand of which are in daily use, I had the impression that  the rapidity of the performance was dependent upon the quickness of  the finger reaction. The managers, on the other hand, have found that  the most essential condition for speed in the whole work is the  ability to retain a large number of words in memory before they are  set. The man who presses the keys rather slowly advances more rapidly  than another who moves his fingers quickly, but must make many pauses  in order to find his place in the manuscript and to provide himself  with new words.    The factors which are to be brought into correlation are, accordingly,  first, the actual experiences of the managers, secondly, the  observations of skilled psychologists in the industrial concerns,  thirdly, psychological and experimental investigations with successful  and unsuccessful laborers, and, fourthly, experimental studies of the  normal variability. If such a programme is to be realized in detail,  it will be necessary to discriminate carefully, between those mental  traits of the personality which must be accredited to a lasting  inherited disposition and such as have been developed under the  influences of the surroundings, by education and training, by bad or  good stimuli from the community. While those acquired traits may have  become relatively lasting dispositions, their transformation is, after  all, possible, and the limits in which changes may be expected will  have to be found out by exact studies. Individual psychological  rhythm, attention and emotion, memory and will energy, disposition to  fatigue and to restoration, imagination, suggestibility and  initiative, and many other features will have to be examined in their  relation to the special economic aims.    Too much emphasis cannot be laid on another function as well, the  experimental testing of which has only recently been started. I refer  to the difference in the individual ability of men to profit from  training. If we test an individual at a certain point in his life with  regard to a variable ability, our result must be dependent upon three  factors, the original disposition for the performance, the original  disposition for the advance by training, and the training itself  actually passed through up to that moment. A small amount of  antecedent training for the particular task together with a high  ability to profit from repetition may be a better reason for the  appointment of a man than a long training with small ability to profit  from schooling, in spite of the fact that his actual achievement at  this time may be in the first case smaller than in the second. He will  do less at first, but he promises to outrank the other man after a  period of further training. Special experiments must be carried on and  have been actually started to determine this plasticity of the  psychophysical apparatus as an independent inborn trait of the  individual.[16]    This invasion of psychology into the field of economic activities is  still so little advanced that the thought of a real distribution of  the wage-earners among the various commercial and industrial positions  on the basis of psychological tests would lead far beyond the present  possibilities. Moreover, many factors would interfere with its being  carried out consistently, even if a much higher stage of experimental  research were reached. The thousands of social and local reasons which  influence the choice of a vocation to-day would to a certain degree  remain in force also in a period of better psychological analysis.  Moreover, the personal inclinations and interests naturally would and  ought to remain the mainspring of economic action. This inclination,  which gives so much of the joy in labor, is by no means necessarily  coincident with those psychophysical dispositions which insure the  most successful work. Political economists have found this out  repeatedly from their statistical inquiries. Very careful studies of  the textile industry in Germany carried out in recent years[17]  yielded the result that the intelligent, highly trained textile  laborer often dislikes his work the more, the more he shows ability  for it, this ability being measured by the wages the individuals earn  at piecework. The wage and the emotional attitude were not seldom  inversely related. Those who were able to produce by far more than  others and accordingly earned the most were sometimes the very ones  who hated the work, while the less skillful workers earned less but  enjoyed the work more. The consulting economic psychologist will,  therefore at first reasonably confine himself to warning the misfits  at an early time. Even within these limits his service can be useful  to both parties, the employers and the employees. He will only slowly  reach the stage at which this negative warning may be supplemented by  positive suggestions, as to the commercial industrial activities for  which the psychophysical dispositions promise particular success.    A real assumption of responsibility for success of course cannot be  risked by the psychologist, inasmuch as the man who may be fitted for  a task by his mental working dispositions may nevertheless destroy his  chances for success by secondary personal traits. He may be dishonest,  or dissipated, or a drinker, or a fighter, or physically ill. Finally,  we ought not to forget that all such efforts to adjust to one another  the psychological traits and the requirements of the work can never  have"]]]
