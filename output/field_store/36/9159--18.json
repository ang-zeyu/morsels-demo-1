The little house  between the two palaces is taken from a reminiscence of the Hradschin  in Prague, and thus points again to the girl who is a native of that  city.    If with my patients I emphasize the frequency of the Oedipus dream--of  having sexual intercourse with one's mother--I get the answer: \"I cannot  remember such a dream.\" Immediately afterwards, however, there arises  the recollection of another disguised and indifferent dream, which has  been dreamed repeatedly by the patient, and the analysis shows it to be  a dream of this same content--that is, another Oedipus dream. I can  assure the reader that veiled dreams of sexual intercourse with the  mother are a great deal more frequent than open ones to the same effect.    There are dreams about landscapes and localities in which emphasis is  always laid upon the assurance: \"I have been there before.\" In this case  the locality is always the genital organ of the mother; it can indeed be  asserted with such certainty of no other locality that one \"has been  there before.\"    A large number of dreams, often full of fear, which are concerned with  passing through narrow spaces or with staying, in the water, are based  upon fancies about the embryonic life, about the sojourn in the mother's  womb, and about the act of birth. The following is the dream of a young  man who in his fancy has already while in embryo taken advantage of his  opportunity to spy upon an act of coition between his parents.    _\"He is in a deep shaft, in which there is a window, as in the Semmering  Tunnel. At first he sees an empty landscape through this window, and  then he composes a picture into it, which is immediately at hand and  which fills out the empty space. The picture represents a field which is  being thoroughly harrowed by an implement, and the delightful air, the  accompanying idea of hard work, and the bluish-black clods of earth make  a pleasant impression. He then goes on and sees a primary school opened  ... and he is surprised that so much attention is devoted in it to the  sexual feelings of the child, which makes him think of me.\"_    Here is a pretty water-dream of a female patient, which was turned to  extraordinary account in the course of treatment.    _At her summer resort at the ... Lake, she hurls herself into the dark  water at a place where the pale moon is reflected in the water._    Dreams of this sort are parturition dreams; their interpretation is  accomplished by reversing the fact reported in the manifest dream  content; thus, instead of \"throwing one's self into the water,\" read  \"coming out of the water,\" that is, \"being born.\" The place from which  one is born is recognized if one thinks of the bad sense of the French  \"la lune.\" The pale moon thus becomes the white \"bottom\" (Popo), which  the child soon recognizes as the place from which it came. Now what can  be the meaning of the patient's wishing to be born at her summer resort?  I asked the dreamer this, and she answered without hesitation: \"Hasn't  the treatment made me as though I were born again?\" Thus the dream  becomes an invitation to continue the cure at this summer resort, that  is, to visit her there; perhaps it also contains a very bashful allusion  to the wish to become a mother herself.[1]    Another dream of parturition, with its interpretation, I take from the  work of E. Jones. _\"She stood at the seashore watching a small boy, who  seemed to be hers, wading into the water. This he did till the water  covered him, and she could only see his head bobbing up and down near  the surface. The scene then changed to the crowded hall of a hotel. Her  husband left her, and she 'entered into conversation with' a  stranger.\"_ The second half of the dream was discovered in the analysis  to represent a flight from her husband, and the entering into intimate  relations with a third person, behind whom was plainly indicated Mr.  X.'s brother mentioned in a former dream. The first part of the dream  was a fairly evident birth phantasy. In dreams as in mythology, the  delivery of a child _from_ the uterine waters is commonly presented by  distortion as the entry of the child _into_ water; among many others,  the births of Adonis, Osiris, Moses, and Bacchus are well-known  illustrations of this. The bobbing up and down of the head in the water  at once recalled to the patient the sensation of quickening she had  experienced in her only pregnancy. Thinking of the boy going into the  water induced a reverie in which she saw herself taking him out of the  water, carrying him into the nursery, washing him and dressing him, and  installing him in her household.    The second half of the dream, therefore, represents thoughts concerning  the elopement, which belonged to the first half of the underlying latent  content; the first half of the dream corresponded with the second half  of the latent content, the birth phantasy. Besides this inversion in  order, further inversions took place in each half of the dream. In the  first half the child _entered_ the water, and then his head bobbed; in  the underlying dream thoughts first the quickening occurred, and then  the child left the water (a double inversion). In the second half her  husband left her; in the dream thoughts she left her husband.    Another parturition dream is related by Abraham of a young woman looking  forward to her first confinement. From a place in the floor of the house  a subterranean canal leads directly into the water (parturition path,  amniotic liquor). She lifts up a trap in the floor, and there  immediately appears a creature dressed in a brownish fur, which almost  resembles a seal. This creature changes into the younger brother of the  dreamer, to whom she has always stood in maternal relationship.    Dreams of \"saving\" are connected with parturition dreams. To save,  especially to save from the water, is equivalent to giving birth when  dreamed by a woman; this sense is, however, modified when the dreamer is  a man.    Robbers, burglars at night, and ghosts, of which we are afraid before  going to bed, and which occasionally even disturb our sleep, originate  in one and the same childish reminiscence. They are the nightly visitors  who have awakened the child to set it on the chamber so that it may not  wet the bed, or have lifted the cover in order to see clearly how the  child is holding its hands while sleeping. I have been able to induce an  exact recollection of the nocturnal visitor in the analysis of some of  these anxiety dreams. The robbers were always the father, the ghosts  more probably corresponded to feminine persons with white night-gowns.    When one has become familiar with the abundant use of symbolism for the  representation of sexual material in dreams, one naturally raises the  question whether there are not many of these symbols which appear once  and for all with a firmly established significance like the signs in  stenography; and one is tempted to compile a new dream-book according to  the cipher method. In this connection it may be remarked that this  symbolism does not belong peculiarly to the dream, but rather to  unconscious thinking, particularly that of the masses, and it is to be  found in greater perfection in the folklore, in the myths, legends, and  manners of speech, in the proverbial sayings, and in the current  witticisms of a nation than in its dreams.    The dream takes advantage of this symbolism in order to give a disguised  representation to its latent thoughts. Among the symbols which are used  in this manner there are of course many which regularly, or almost  regularly, mean the same thing. Only it is necessary to keep in mind the  curious plasticity of psychic material. Now and then a symbol in the  dream content may have to be interpreted not symbolically, but according  to its real meaning; at another time the dreamer, owing to a peculiar  set of recollections, may create for himself the right to use anything  whatever as a sexual symbol, though it is not ordinarily used in that  way. Nor are the most frequently used sexual symbols unambiguous every  time.    After these limitations and reservations I may call attention to the  following: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) in most cases really  represent the parents of the dreamer; the dreamer himself or herself is  the prince or princess. All elongated objects, sticks, tree-trunks, and  umbrellas (on account of the stretching-up which might be compared to an  erection! all elongated and sharp weapons, knives, daggers, and pikes,  are intended to represent the male member. A frequent, not very  intelligible, symbol for the same is a nail-file (on account of the  rubbing and scraping?). Little cases, boxes, caskets, closets, and  stoves correspond to the female part. The symbolism of lock and key has  been very gracefully employed by Uhland in his song about the \"Grafen  Eberstein,\" to make a common smutty joke. The dream of walking through a  row of rooms is a brothel or harem dream. Staircases, ladders, and  flights of stairs, or climbing on these, either upwards or downwards,  are symbolic representations of the sexual act. Smooth walls over which  one is climbing, facades of houses upon which one is letting oneself  down, frequently under great anxiety, correspond to the erect human  body, and probably repeat in the dream reminiscences of the upward  climbing of little children on their parents or foster parents. \"Smooth\"  walls are men. Often in a dream of anxiety one is holding on firmly to  some projection from a house. Tables, set tables, and boards are women,  perhaps on account of the opposition which does away with the bodily  contours. Since \"bed and board\" (_mensa et thorus_)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#16)"],[1," young may learn to know Christ in all His sweetness.    For Christ is Joy and Sweetness to a broken heart. Christ is a Lover of  poor sinners, and such a Lover that He gave Himself for us. Now if  this is true, and it is true, then are we never justified by our own  righteousness.    Read the words \"me\" and \"for me\" with great emphasis. Print this \"me\"  with capital letters in your heart, and do not ever doubt that you  belong to the number of those who are meant by this \"me.\" Christ did not  only love Peter and Paul. The same love He felt for them He feels for  us. If we cannot deny that we are sinners, we cannot deny that Christ  died for our sins.        VERSE 21. I do not frustrate the grace of God.    Paul is now getting ready for the second argument of his Epistle, to the  effect that to seek justification by works of the Law, is to reject the  grace of God. I ask you, what sin can be more horrible than to reject  the grace of God, and to refuse the righteousness of Christ? It is  bad enough that we are wicked sinners and transgressors of all the  commandments of God; on top of that to refuse the grace of God and the  remission of sins offered unto us by Christ, is the worst sin of all,  the sin of sins. That is the limit. There is no sin which Paul and the  other apostles detested more than when a person despises the grace of  God in Christ Jesus. Still there is no sin more common. That is why Paul  can get so angry at the Antichrist, because he snubs Christ, rebuffs the  grace of God, and refuses the merit of Christ. What else would you call  it but spitting in Christ's face, pushing Christ to the side, usurping  Christ's throne, and to say: \"I am going to justify you people; I am  going to save you.\" By what means? By masses, pilgrimages, pardons,  merits, etc. For this is Antichrist's doctrine: Faith is no good, unless  it is reinforced by works. By this abominable doctrine Antichrist has  spoiled, darkened, and buried the benefit of Christ, and in place of  the grace of Christ and His Kingdom, he has established the doctrine of  works and the kingdom of ceremonies.    We despise the grace of God when we observe the Law for the purpose of  being justified. The Law is good, holy, and profitable, but it does not  justify. To keep the Law in order to be justified means to reject grace,  to deny Christ, to despise His sacrifice, and to be lost.        VERSE 21. For if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead    in vain.    Did Christ die, or did He not die? Was His death worth while, or was it  not? If His death was worth while, it follows that righteousness does  not come by the Law. Why was Christ born anyway? Why was He crucified?  Why did He suffer? Why did He love me and give Himself for me? It was  all done to no purpose if righteousness is to be had by the Law.    Or do you think that God spared not His Son, but delivered Him for us  all, for the fun of it? Before I would admit anything like that, I would  consign the holiness of the saints and of the angels to hell.    To reject the grace of God is a common sin, of which everybody is guilty  who sees any righteousness in himself or in his deeds. And the Pope is  the sole author of this iniquity. Not content to spoil the Gospel of  Christ, he has filled the world with his cursed traditions, e.g., his  bulls and indulgences.    We will always affirm with Paul that either Christ died in vain, or else  the Law cannot justify us. But Christ did not suffer and die in vain.  Hence, the Law does not justify.    If my salvation was so difficult to accomplish that it necessitated the  death of Christ, then all my works, all the righteousness of the Law,  are good for nothing. How can I buy for a penny what cost a million  dollars? The Law is a penny's worth when you compare it with Christ.  Should I be so stupid as to reject the righteousness of Christ which  cost me nothing, and slave like a fool to achieve the righteousness of  the Law which God disdains?    Man's own righteousness is in the last analysis a despising and  rejecting of the grace of God. No combination of words can do justice to  such an outrage. It is an insult to say that any man died in vain. But  to say that Christ died in vain is a deadly insult. To say that Christ  died in vain is to make His resurrection, His victory, His glory, His  kingdom, heaven, earth, God Himself, of no purpose and benefit whatever.    That is enough to set any person against the righteousness of the Law  and all the trimmings of men's own righteousness, the orders of monks  and friars, and their superstitions.    Who would not detest his own vows, his cowls, his shaven crown, his  bearded traditions, yes, the very Law of Moses, when he hears that for  such things he rejected the grace of God and the death of Christ. It  seems that such a horrible wickedness could not enter a man's heart,  that he should reject the grace of God, and despise the death of Christ.  And yet this atrocity is all too common. Let us be warned. Everyone  who seeks righteousness without Christ, either by works, merits,  satisfactions, actions, or by the Law, rejects the grace of God, and  despises the death of Christ.          CHAPTER 3        VERSE 1. 0 foolish Galatians.    THE Apostle Paul manifests his apostolic care for the Galatians.  Sometimes he entreats them, then again he reproaches them, in accordance  with his own advice to Timothy: \"Preach the word; be instant in season,  out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort.\"    In the midst of his discourse on Christian righteousness Paul breaks  off, and turns to address the Galatians. \"O foolish Galatians,\" he  cries. \"I have brought you the true Gospel, and you received it with  eagerness and gratitude. Now all of a sudden you drop the Gospel. What  has got into you?\"    Paul reproves the Galatians rather sharply when he calls them \"fools,  bewitched, and disobedient.\" Whether he is indignant or sorry, I cannot  say. He may be both. It is the duty of a Christian pastor to reprove the  people committed to his charge. Of course, his anger must not flow from  malice, but from affection and a real zeal for Christ.    There is no question that Paul is disappointed. It hurts him to think  that his Galatians showed so little stability. We can hear him say:  \"I am sorry to hear of your troubles, and disappointed in you for the  disgraceful part you played.\" I say rather much on this point to save  Paul from the charge that he railed upon the churches, contrary to the  spirit of the Gospel.    A certain distance and coolness can be noted in the title with which  the Apostle addresses the Galatians. He does not now address them as his  brethren, as he usually does. He addresses them as Galatians in order to  remind them of their national trait to be foolish.    We have here an example of bad traits that often cling to individual  Christians and entire congregations. Grace does not suddenly transform a  Christian into a new and perfect creature. Dregs of the old and natural  corruption remain. The Spirit of God cannot at once overcome human  deficiency. Sanctification takes time.    Although the Galatians had been enlightened by the Holy Spirit through  the preaching of faith, something of their national trait of foolishness  plus their original depravity clung to them. Let no man think that once  he has received faith, he can presently be converted into a faultless  creature. The leavings of old vices will stick to him, be he ever so  good a Christian.        VERSE 1. Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth?    Paul calls the Galatians foolish and bewitched. In the fifth chapter he  mentions sorcery among the works of the flesh, declaring that witchcraft  and sorcery are real manifestations and legitimate activities of the  devil. We are all exposed to the influence of the devil, because he is  the prince and god of the world in which we live.    Satan is clever. He does not only bewitch men in a crude manner, but  also in a more artful fashion. He bedevils the minds of men with hideous  fallacies. Not only is he able to deceive the self-assured, but even  those who profess the true Christian faith. There is not one among us  who is not at times seduced by Satan into false beliefs.    This accounts for the many new battles we have to wage nowadays. But  the attacks of the old Serpent are not without profit to us, for they  confirm our doctrine and strengthen our faith in Christ. Many a time we  were wrestled down in these conflicts with Satan, but Christ has always  triumphed and always will triumph. Do not think that the Galatians were  the only ones to be bewitched by the devil. Let us realize that we too  may be seduced by Satan.      VERSE 1. Who hath bewitched you?    In this sentence Paul excuses the Galatians, while he blames the false  apostles for the apostasy of the Galatians.    As if he were saying: \"I know your defection was not willful. The devil  sent the false apostles to you, and they tallied you into believing that  you are justified by the Law. With this our epistle we endeavor to undo  the damage which the false apostles have inflicted upon you.\"    Like Paul, we struggle with the Word of God against the fanatical  Anabaptists of our day; and our efforts are not entirely in vain. The  trouble is there are many who refuse to be instructed. They will not  listen to reason; they will not listen to the Scriptures, because they  are bewitched by the tricky devil who can make a lie look like the  truth.    Since the devil has this uncanny ability to make us believe a lie until  we would swear a thousand times it were the truth, we must not be proud,  but walk in fear and humility, and call upon the Lord Jesus to save us  from temptation.    Although I am a doctor of divinity, and have preached Christ and  fought His battles for a long time, I know from personal experience how  difficult it is to hold fast to the truth. I cannot always shake off"]]]
